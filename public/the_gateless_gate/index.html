Road,\nBombay-16. DD. THE GATELESS GATE A collection of 30 immortal letters written by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh to different seekers all over the world\n1/ Just Be Aware And Await Dear Bhakti, Love.\nI am thrilled with great expectations about you.\nOh! Much is to happen within you and without also. You are on the verge of the explosion.\nSo, be alone.\nNot lonely, but Alone.\nAnd live with that Aloneness. Rather BE that Aloneness.\nThat is the only meditation to you Now. Loneliness is negative.\nTo be lonely is to be aware of the absence of others. But to be alone is the most positive state of the mind. It is to be aware of the PRESENCE of Oneself.\nBe aware of thepresence that is YOU. Just be aware.\nAnd Await.\nAwait the happening.\nNear - very near is the Moment.\nAnd remember that I am always with you. I have been always with you.\nEven when you did not know me. And always feel my blessings.\n17-8-1970\n(To Ma Yoga Bhakti, C/o. Shree Tanya Smith, Pantherkill Road, Phoenicia, New York, U.S.A.)\n2/ Let Meditation Be Thy Very Existence Dear Saraswati, Love.\nI hope you will be in deep meditation. Breathe in it, sleep in it, live in it.\nLet meditation be thy very existence. Only then is the HAPPENING. Don't do it, but BE IT.\nAnd, my blessings are always with you.\nIf you need any help from me, just ask when you are thoughtless.\nAnd, it will be GIVEN to you.\n25-10-1970\n(To Dr. Miss Colette Guinebert, alias Ma Saraswati, 87, Avenue due Maine XIVe Paris, 75, France).\n3/ Let The Meditation Ripen You Dear Henrotte, Love.\nCome here.\nWhenever it is possible.\nYou will always be welcomed. And, stay with me for a little longer. And, let me help.\nIt will be difficult for you, because, you will have to\nLET GO yourself completely. But it is not impossible.\nAnd with you especially.\nBecause, I have seen in you the great potential that is awaiting its opportunity.\nWith you much impossible is possible.\nThe seed is there which is longing to explode. Its very longing is the source of your search. Its longing is the Tension that you are today.\nAnd its longing will be the Freedom that you will be tomorrow.\nThe essence is there and the existence will follow it, if you so wish,\nPlease, follow its callto the conclusion.\nGo on doing meditation. Do not seek results.\nThey will come by themselves, when the time is ripe.\nAnd The Time Is Ripe. But still you are not.\nLet meditation ripen you.\n25-10-1970\n(To Dr. Jean Georges Henrotte, 65, Rue De Lt, Federation, Paris-15, France).\n4/ Say Wholeheartedly: `Thy Will be Done’ Dear Bhakti, Love.\nYour letter.\nI know your inner condition more than you know yourself.\nBecause, NOW, your inner is not my outer.\nThings that are happening to you unconsciously AND even against your conscious will are GOOD. WELCOME them and be grateful.\nBecause, nothing divine can happen with you and your will.\nRather, your will is the only barrier in the way. Say wholeheartedly: \"Thy will be done\".\nAnd feel it. And live it.\nCome HOME soon. I am waiting for you.\nAnd much more is waiting to happen to you; also I know you are sceptical.\nThat is not bad.\nBut a good beginning to begin with. Wherever, there is mind, there is skepticism Mind is scepticism.\nAnd therefore conflict.\nThat is the way of the mind. And its Nature.\nPlease do not fight with it.\nAnd neither be identified with it. These are the obvious alternatives. But both false.\nAnd aspects of the same coin. You will have to walk in-between.\nCome, and be with me and you will understand.\n27-10-1970\nP.S. You know better than me,\nWhether I am coming to the U.S.A. or not Because, I will not come, unless you call me there.\nThis much is decided now - the remaining will be decided when you meet me.\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, Sivananda Ashram, New York, U.S.A.).\n5/ The Call from Beyond Has Come Dear Ananda Prema, Love and blessings.\nReceived your letter. I was waiting for it daily, since you\nleft.\nI know that you have gone far away from here; but I also know that NOW you cannot go away from ME.\nAnd, that nearness is all that counts.\nYou have come near to me in a non-spatial and non- temporal sense.\nThe meeting has taken place in the NO-WHERE. Or, in the EVERY-WHERE.\nBecause, they both mean the same thing.\nAnd, the real MEETING takes place only in this way. All else is illusion.\nRemember me whenever you need and you will find me then and there.\nAsk, anything - and WAIT and you will be answered. The barriers have fallen down from your mind.\nAnd, you have entered the meditative state. Now the DOORS of the divine are open.\nDO NOT HESITATE AND TAKE THE PLUNGE.\nYou are completely ready - just only be courageous to enter the uncharted and the unknown.\nThe CALL from BEYOND has come - now accept the challenge and be FULFILLED.\nNow, close your eyes and feel me and see me and let my blessings be showered on you.\nSend Bhakti soon and convey my love to her.\n27-11-1970\n(To Ma Ananda Prema, Sivananda Ashram, 205, East, 77th Street, 10-A, New York, N.Y. 10021, U.S.A.).\n6/ Freedom From Becoming My Beloved One, Love.\nFreedom from becoming means freedom for BEING.\nBecoming is desiring. BEING is That-Which-Is.\nBecoming is longing for the future. BEING is to be in the present.\nBecoming is mental. BEING is existential.\nThat is why - becoming must cease for the BEING to reveal itself.\nBecoming is just like the smoke around the flame. Or, just like the outer covering around the seed.\nSo, please let the smoke go for the flame to explode in its complete glory and splendour.\nAnd, let the seed die to its outer shell so that it may be what it is in its inner most depth.\n7-1-1971\n(To Shree Dharmendra Tukaram Dhokhe, Clerk, Police Wireless Training Centre, Pashan Road, Poona-8, India)\n7/ In This Way, The Ocean Drops into the Drop Beloved Bhakti, Love.\nBe in the crowd as if you are alone. And vice versa.\nReceive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. And, when alone, maintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests.\nIn this way, the drop drops in the Ocean.\nUpon retiring, sleep as if you have entered your last sleep. And, upon awakening be reborn again.\nIn this way, the ocean drops into the drop.\n15-1-1971\n(To Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n8/ Be Open, And Let Things Happen Beloved Bhakti,\nLove. When you are with me be completely at ease and relaxed; that is, be totally yourself.\nIf you feel like crying then cry.\nIf you feel like weeping then weep. But just be uninterruptedly aware.\nDo not think about what you are doing - just be the doing and when your senses are shaken like leaves in the wind - then enter this shaking.\nBecause, only in such situations the being is revealed.\nIf a mood against someone or for someone arises do not place it on the person in question but remain centered in yourself and you will know a transcendence which is not of this world at all.\n16-1-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n9/ Carefulness for Spiritual Crisis Dear Atmananda,\nLove. Bhakti needs only time to absorb the shock she has come across her deep meditations.\nRemember: only TIME and nothing else. The shock is nothing new.\nIt happens whenever the deeper layers of the unconscious are encountered.\nBefore any mutation this is absolutely necessary.\nBe grateful to the Divine because this is a good omen. Bhakti needed it badly; and when she is out of it, she will be a new person totally.\nSoon she will be twice-born.\nPresently she is passing through a great spiritual crisis - so you be with her but just as if you are not.\nBe present but with absolute absence.\nThis is the only way you can be helpful to her. Let her be alone as much as possible.\nDo not talk with her except it is needed absolutely. And, then too, be telegraphic.\nBut if she herself wants to talk, let her talk as much as she likes - and you yourself be just a passive listener.\nLet her do whatsoever she wants to do or not to do. And soon everything will be O.K.\nDo not worry at all.\nI will be there besides you always - and if you can see you will be able to see me also.\nOf course, Bhakti will feel my Presence and will become aware of me these days so many times.\nConvey my blessings to Bhakti.\n27-1-1971\n(To Ma Atmananda (Mrs. Wellington, now Ma Dhyan Siddhi) 1016, Old Post Road, Mamarneck, New York, 10543, U.S.A.)\n10/ Ecstasy and Bliss of Living Moment to Moment Dear Saraswati,\nLove. I live not by planning and I also feel that that is the only way to be alive at all.\nIn fact, I live a wild life - absolutely unplanned - not knowing anything about the future, not even about the next moment.\nToday is enough for me - really more than enough!\nThe moment that is present is the only living moment - the past is dead in the sense that it is no more and the future is also dead in the sense that it is not yet born.\nAnd, so to be concerned with the past is to be dead and to be concerned with the future is also to be dead.\nThe only way to be alive is to be here and now - in the moment and totally in it.\nLiving moment to moment I have foundthat Ecstasy and bliss which is not of this world at all.\nThe single moment lived totally transcends time itself. It becomes the gap between two moments of time.\nAnd, if one can be in this gap then one is beyond death. Because, time is death; and timelessness is life.\nLife is not something fixed and finished - Life is living that is - a process - just river like - flowing always into the unknown - from the shores of the known to the shores of the unknown.\n27-1-1971\n(To, Docteur C. Guinebert, 87, Avenue Du Maine, XIV Medicis 26-94 Paris, France)\n11/ Spiritual Sleep and Constant Awareness Dear Ananda Prema,\nLove. Do not forget the search for the Divine for even a single moment.\nBecause, the time is always short and the task is great. And, besides, the mind is wavering.\nIn fact, the mind is the wavering.\nRemember this - and remain aware of this fact as much as you can.\nBecause, the moment one is aware the wavering stops. And in the intervals are the glimpses - glimpses of oneself\n- glimpses of no-mind.\nOne has to transcend the wavering of the mind absolutely before one comes to the doors of the Beloved.\nNO-MINDNESS is the Door.\nAnd the door is not far off. But the seeker is asleep.\nMIND is the SLEEP.\nThat is why you will have to be attentive and alert of everything that passes before your consciousness - even be attentive of the in-attentive moments.\nThrough constant awareness the spiritual sleep will be broken and you will be transformed.\nThis is your potentiality - this is every ones potentiality.\nAnd, for you the time is RIPE.\nBut the seed can remain a seed and die.\nThe opportunity can be lost.\nYou are free to be that which you are meant to be - or to be that which you are not meant to be.\nMan is free to be or not to be.\nThis is the glory and this is the burden. Freedom means responsibility.\nSo be careful.\nIf you can be that which is your potentiality - if you can flower to your fullness - then there is bliss - then there is ECSTASY; otherwise ashes are in hands and anguish in the heart.\nAnd, ultimately everything depends on you.\nHeaven or Hell - and you and only you will be responsible for it.\nSo be careful.\nMy blessings are always with you.\n28-1-1971\n(To, Ma Ananda Prema, Sivananda Ashram, 205, East 77th St. 10-A New York, 10021, U.S.A.)\n12/ Meditation Is Encountering Yourself In Total Nakedness Beloved Bhakti,\nLove. Everything has happened, as it should happen.\nAnd I was surprised not because you ran away from here, but because I never thought that you could be so predictable!\nIt is not from here that you have escaped; it is only a vain effort to escape from yourself.\nWhich is impossible.\nHow can one escape from oneself?\nBut, in meditation a moment comes necessarily when the mind tries the impossible - for the mind this is the last defensive act.\nMeditation is ultimately suicidal to the mind.\nAnd, of course, the mind must be given a chance! And, you have given it!\nMeditation is encountering yourself - directly and in your total nakedness.\nThis creates fear and the futile effort to escape.\nThe effort is futile because whatsoever is known once - it is known for ever and you cannot be the old ignorant again.\nThere is no way to go back. And there is no bridge.\nThis escape too will make you more mature; and you will\ncome back strengthened through it and because of it.\nNOW - RELAX there under the sky and besides the sea - and I will be there.\nWhenever you are relaxed you will feel my presence.\nAnd, when you feel like coming - come back. And soon you will feel.\nI will be waiting here for you as ever.\nCOME and recontinue the arduous journey towards your self.\nConvey my love and blessings to Anand Prema.\n25- 2-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, C/o. Mrs. Wellington, 1015, Old Post Road, Mamarneck, New York, 10543, U.S.A.)\n13/ Divineness and Beauty of Being No-Body Dear Krishna Christ.\nLove. Oh! Don’t take life so seriously! Because seriousness is a great dis-ease. And not only a disease but a suicide also. Be playful - totally.\nBecause that is the only way to be living.\nLife is a play - a leela.\nAnd to know it so is religion.\nAnd to live it so is sannyas - renunciation.\nIf you can act and live as if acting and living in a dream and still be a witness to it then you will be in the cosmic flow - the TAO.\nAnd to be in the cosmic flow is to be free - free from oneself - the EGO.\nThe EGO is the seriousness - the disease.\nAnd the TAO - the egoless existence is the bliss - the ecstasy.\nThat is why I have given you a name - so absurd! But I have given it to you knowingly.\nI have given it to you so that you may never be identified with it.\nThe name is so absurd that you will have to remain nameless and no-body behind it.\nAnd the name is such that not only others but you yourself will be able to laugh at it.\nSWAMI KRISHNA CHRIST!\nOh! What a name?\nBut perfectly suitable in a dream-drama.\nIs it not so?\nSo feel at ease with it - and laugh with it and sing and dance with it and be SWAMI KRISHNA CHRIST with all the letters in capital!\nAnd - always remember that you are no-body.\nAnd always be aware that you are neither a Swami - nor a Krishna - nor a Christ.\nThis is what is meant by a Swami!\nAnd, Krishna himself is not a Krishna and Christ himself is not a Christ - because they are nameless - absolutely nameless.\nThey are no-bodies - and that is what makes them divine. The moment one is identified with any name, one is lost to one's divinity.\nEither one can be a name or a reality. And no one can be both simultaneously. Be a name really - and your reality is lost.\nBe a reality really - and your name is just a dream - maya. And, what non-sense to be a Swami!\nBut once one is at ease with the non-sense one transcends it.\nPlease! Don't try to be sensible otherwise you will never be with any sense at all!\nBecause only stupidity tries to be sensible!\nThe existence is absurd.\nAnd meaningless.\nAnd irrational.\nAnd that is why it is so beautiful. And to be in it is such a blessing!\n14- 4-1971\n(To, Swami Krishna Christ, alias Mr. Walter Pfuetze, 5, Vassar Lake Drive, Poughkeepsie, New York, Zip 12601, U.S.A.)\n14/ Dance In Ecstasy to Welcome the Divine Happening Beloved Tao,\nLove. I know what is happening to you. The nothingness is descending.\nThe emptiness is increasing.\nWelcome it - and rejoice in its coming.\nDance in ecstasy - because there is no other way to welcome it.\nAnd the more you dance, the more you will die.\nAnd when you are dead completely you will be reborn.\nAnd that moment is near - very near - just by the corner.\nYou have passed through the entrance-explosion and now be ready for the ultimate.\nLook at yourself once more as the river looks at itself before falling into the ocean - because after falling into the ocean there will be no one to look - and no one to be looked at!\n16-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Tao, alias Mary Elizabeth Ann Small, Box- 93, Knotts Island, North Carolina, U.S.A.)\n15/ Surrender Happens Beloved Tao,\nLove. Don't think about Surrender at all - because\nthat-which-thinks about it is the only barrier.\nAnd therefore no one can surrender; it is not a doing at all.\nIt happens - you cannot go to it - it comes to you. And, any effort on your part will hinder its coming.Be open and effortless - relaxed and passive.\nAnd it will come - it always comes. I am a witness to it.\n16-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Tao, North Carolina, U.S.A.)\n16/ Life Is Playful and Festive Beloved Mukta,\nLove. To me meditation means: be playful and transcend all seriousness.\nSee: life is not serious.\nLook around: `existence is not serious.'\nOnly disease is serious. And of course, DEATH.\nAnd the exploiters of death: The Priests!\nLife is playful andfestive and, therefore,purposeless.\nIt is not going anywhere - because there is nowhere to go. It is always Here and Here.\nIt is always Now and Now.\nIt is just abundant energy overflowing from here to here\nand from now to now.\nAnd, once you know it and be it - you are in that ecstasy which is the purpose of purposelessness!\nDon't be a MIND and you will know it and be it.\nMeditation isno-mindness.\nMind is thinking and thinking is going astray from the BEING.\nMind is forgetfulness of that-which-is. Meditation is coming back HOME. So, Mukta, come back home.\nAnd, I create situations so that you may remember the forgotten.\nAnd, I will go on creating situations unless you are back.\n16-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Mukta, alias Mrs. Catherine Venizelos, Seville Ave, Rye, New York, U.S.A.)\n17/ Ego - the Creator of all the Agonies Beloved Bhakti,\nLove. Be ordinary - so ordinary that virtually you come to be no-body.\nAnd, there is the opening. And, there is the explosion.\nAnd, only when you are not - you are the extra-ordinary!\nBut do not think about it. And, do not crave for it.\nAnd, if the craving comes - be aware and LAUGH.\nIt will be stopped in awareness and the created energy will be used by the laughter.\nAnd, after the laugh you will feel a deep relaxation. And, then begin to dance or sing.\nAnd the negative state of the mind will be transformed into the positive.\nThe craving to be someone - somebody is absolutely negative; because the ego is the negation of BEING. The ego is the principle of negation.\nAnd, if the negative is negated then you are positive.\nThe ego is the source ofall inferiority.\nBut the trick is subtle.\nBecause the ego promises superiority and only in the end results in inferiority.\nDecode this secret and understand it very clearly\nOne who thinks in terms of superiority will remain always inferior - because they are two aspects of the same coin.\nOh! Sow the seeds of superiority and you will reap the crop of inferiority.\nBegin with the longing of superiority and you will end with nothing but inferiority and all the hell that is involved in it.\nBegin with humbleness - with humility and you are nearer to the Divine.\nIn fact, you are Divine but the ego will not allow you any gap to look into your own divinity.\nOn the contrary, it will go on creating new imaginary heavens only to make way for new hells.\nEnter heaven and you are entering hell!\nBeware of this and beware of your so-called self - the creator of all the agonies that exist on earth.\nAnd be a NO-SELF and you will be THAT - you are already and have been always THAT which is bliss eternal.\nAnd freedom.\nAnd the cosmic BEING - The `Brahm' \"Tatvamasi\" - That art Thou, my Love.\n16-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n18/ Transcendence of Death Beloved Kusum,\nLove. Moment to moment life passes into death. Because it is death.\nCovered, it appears as life. Uncovered, it is death.\nRemember this fact always. This is silent meditation.\nAnd, when this remembering penetrates even in your dreams you will have a new door opened unto you. Through it in fact, you will be altogether new.\nAnd ultimately reborn. .\nRemembering death gives a new dimension to\nconsciousness.\nBecause to remember death is not natural\nOn the contrary nature has arranged so that one should not be aware of it.\nBecause the moment one transcends death one transcends nature also.\nAnd, one cannot transcend death unless one is totally aware of the fact.\nSo be totally aware of death.\nAnd it is happening each moment within and without. It is present everywhere.\nAnd because it is so obvious one becomes absent to it. Remember and deepen the consciousness.\nBecause as the awareness of death goes deeper one becomes capable of feeling that which is deathless. Really, death is the door - the opening to the deathless.\nBut be conscious of it.\nBe conscious and transcend.\nBe conscious and know that which is before birth and after death.\nAnd, you are that.\n17-4-1971\n(To, Mrs. Kusum, C/o. Shree Kapil Mohan Chandhok, Quality Ice Cream Co., 90, Industrial Area-A, LUDHIANA, Punjab, India.)\n19/ Jump into the Unknown Beloved Bhakti,\nLove. The gates of the temple are wide open - and it is only after thousands of years that such opportunity comes to this earth.\nAnd, know well that they will not remain open for ever. And, the opportunity can be lost very easily.\nAnd, you are still wavering.\nAnd, you are still hesitating - to enter or not to enter - to be or not to be.\nI know that the challenge is great.\nBut I know also that your being is completely ready to take the jump.\nHence, my insistent call for you to come and enter. And, this is not for the first time that I have called you - nor the first life.\nI know you, Bhakti, since so many births.\nAnd, soon you will also remember many things.\nBut not before the jump.\nAnd only your superficial persona is resisting - not you. And it is expected to resist always because the moment one takes the plunge into the unknown it has to die naturally.\nSo, please, do not identify yourself with it. Be a witness to it.\nAnd you will be in the jump.\nOh! It is time enough to die to the old ego and be reborn to the supreme self.\n17-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n20/ The way to Ecstasy on and Divine Intoxication Beloved Bhakti,\nLove. Begin the following meditation from tomorrow. And, know that this is an ORDER!\nNow, you are so mine that I cannot do anything else but order!\nPre-requirements:\n(1) Do it cheerfully. (2) Do it relaxedly. (3) And be playful. (4) Do it in the morning after taking the bath.\nMeditation steps:\n1. First Step:\nBreathe deeply and rhythmically. Not fast, but slowly.\nFor 10 minutes.\n2. Second Step:\nDance rhythmically and slowly. Be ecstatic.\nAs if flowing in it. For 10 minutes.\n3. Third Step:\nUse the mahamantra: Hoo–Hoo-Hoo: for 10 minutes.\nContinue dancing and moving. Do not be serious.\nDo not be tense.\nFourth Step:\nClose the eyes and be silent. Do not move or dance now.\nStand, sit or lie down - as you feel to do. But just be as if dead.\nFeel sinking in.\nSurrender and be in the hands of the WHOLE. For 10 minutes.\nPost requirements:\n1. Live the whole day in ecstasy - in intoxication of the Divine. Flowing and flowering in it.\nAnd, whenever depressed - say inwardly: Hoo- Hoo-Hoo and laugh outwardly.\nLaugh without any reason. And, accept the madness.\n2. Before sleep: Chant the mahamantra: Hoo-Hoo- Hoo. For 10 minutes. Then laugh at yourself.\n3. In the morning as you feel awake chant again the mahamantra: Hoo-Hoo-Hoo. For 10 minutes. And, then begin the day with a hearty laugh.\n4. And, remember always that I am with you.\n18-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n21/ Opening of the Locked Doors of the Past Lives Beloved Mukta,\nLove. Yes - you were related to Yoga Vivek in one of your past lives.\nNow, many things will be remembered by you soon.\nBecause the key is in your hands. But do not think about them at all.\nOtherwise your imagination will get mixed up with the memories and then it will be very difficult to know what is real and what is not.\nSo be always aware from now that you are not to think about past lives.\nLet the memories come up by themselves. No conscious effort on your part is needed. On the contrary it will be a great hindrance. Let the unconscious do the work.\nYou be just a witness.\nAnd as the meditation will go deeper many locked doors will be opened to you.\nBut always remember to wait for the mysteries to reveal themselves. The seed is broken - and much is to follow. You only wait and be a witness.\n19-4-1971\n(To, Ma Yoga Mukta, New York, U.S.A.)\n22/ I Am the Gate - the Emptiness Beloved Bhakti, Love. Your letter.\nYou write me that without me you cannot pass through the gate and with me you will not pass through the gate.\nOh! I know that.\nBut you need not do either.\nYou need not pass through the gate with me or not with me.\nBecause, I AM THE GATE.\nBhakti, I am NO-ONE - so how can you be with me or not with me?\nAnd, ONE who is NO-ONE only can be the gate. The Gate means the emptiness.\nBecause the Gate is nothing but the space to pass through. Pass through me - not with me - and know.\nI appear to be some-one only from without.\nBut deeper you penetrate me the less you will find me. And, in the end: NO-ONE.\n19-4-71\n(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)\n23/ Go on Discarding - Until the Nothingness Dear Krishna Karuna,\nLove. Go on discarding - Not this, Not this (Neti-Neti). And, ultimately when nothing remains to be discarded - then is the explosion.\nDo not cling to anything - to any thought. Go on and on until the NOTHINGNESS.\nI have heard about a little boy Toyo and his meditations.\nHe was only twelve years old.\nBut he wanted to be given something to ponder - to meditate.\nSo one evening he went to Mokurai, the Zen master - struck the gong softly to announce his presence and sat before the master in respectful silence.\nFinally, the master said: \"Toyo, show me the sound of two hands.\"\nToyo clapped his hands. \"Good,\" said the master.\n\"Now show me the sound of one hand clapping.\"\nToyo was silent. Finally he bowed and left to meditate on the problem.\nThe next night he returned and struck the gong with one palm.\n\"That is not right,\" said the master.\nThe next night Toyo returned and played Geisha music with one hand.\n\"That is not right,\" said the master.\nAnd again and again Toyo returned with some answer, but the master also said again and again: \"That is not right\".\nFor the nights Toyo tried new sounds. But each and every answer was rejected.\nThe question itself was absurd so no answer could be right.\nAnd when on the eleventh night Toyo came and before he spoke anything, the master said: \"That is still not right!\"\nAnd then he stopped coming to the master.\nFor a year he thought of every possible sound, and discarded them all - and when there was left nothing to be discarded any more - he exploded into enlightenment. And when he was no more, he returned to the master.\nAnd, without striking the gong he sat down and bowed. And, he was not saying anything.\nAnd, there was silence.\nThen the master said: \"So you have heard the sound without sound!\"\n19-4 -1971\n(To Ma Krishna Karuna, Bombay, India.)\n24/ Be Free of the Mind - Prison Dear Michael,\nLove. Do not continue circling in the old rut. And, the way out is just by the hand.\nThe mind is the past - the dead past.\nOne has to break it somewhere and jump out of it. The mind is the prison - the slavery.\nBe free of it.\nAnd, the moment is ripe.\nOf course I know that you are still not clearly aware of it. But you are not unaware also.\nGather courage and jump into the unknown.\nAnd, only one step is enough.\nBecause, the next follows it automatically.\nBut do not go on thinking and thinking and thinking. Thinking promises to lead you somewhere.\nBut the promise remains always a promise. Because thinking is just impotent - as far as life is concerned.\nSo, please, be existential.\nDo not hesitate. And you have nothing to lose - because you have nothing!\nRealize this and be NOTHING - NO-ONE\n26-4-1971\n(To, Mr. Michael Graham, London, England.)\n25/ I Knock Your Door Beloved Dhyana Siddhi, Love. Do you hear me?\nDo you see me?\nI stand at the door and knock.\nAnd, I knock because of a promise made in another life and another age.\n14-5-1971\n(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, (Mrs. Eunice Wellington). Larchmont, New York, U.S.A.)\n26/ Transcendence of Death Through Acceptance Beloved Dhyana Siddhi, Love. Fear cripples consciousness.\nAnd, fear is the source of unconsciousness.\nThat is why without transcending fear, no one can attain to full consciousness.\nBut what is fear?\nFear is awareness of death without knowing what death is! Fear exists in the gap between you and your death.\nAnd if there is no gap, no space, then there is no fear.\nDo not think death as something outside you. Because it is not.\nAnd do not think death as something in the future. Because it is not.\nDeath is within you.\nBecause death is the other side of life. Life cannot exist without death.\nThey both belong to the same energy as positive and negative poles.\nSo do not identify yourself with life, because you are both. The identification with life creates the gap.\nAnd, death has nothing to do with future it is always here and now.\nEvery moment it is.\nAnd, when one ceases to regard it as something outside oneself and, so to speak, draws it into his consciousness\nand assimilates the idea of it, one is completely changed. He is in all truth, born again.\nAnd, then, there is no fear. Because then there is no gap.\n15-5-1971\n(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A)\n27/ Kneeling Down of the Ego Beloved Dhyana Siddhi, Love. We kneel down to ourselves.\nBecause, we kneel down to the gods we make out of our experience or out of our desires and dreams, or out of our so called logic and foolish arguments.\nThis is neither humility, nor prayer.\nRather, on the contrary this is the most egoistic attitude possible.\nThe true religious mind is one which just kneels down, not to anyone, not to any IMAGE in particular.\nThis kneeling down is nothing but a flowering of one's own total nothingness.\nThen this kneeling down becomes an inner way of life. And, unless prayer is such, prayer is not.\nOne cannot pray, one can only be prayerful.\n15-5-1971\n(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)\n28/ Meditation of Conscious Dreaming Beloved dhyana siddhi,\nLove. Use dreaming consciously as meditation. And, know well that conscious dreaming opens new doors of perception.\nLie down, relax and dream. But do not fall asleep.\nRemain conscious in the background. Wait and watch.\nDream anything that happens to your mind. Do not plan beforehand.\nDream anything because in dream the whole world is yours.\nDream your existence as you please. Dream and be content.\nContent with your dreams, because they are yours and remember that nothing can be yours like your dreams, because you yourself are a dream-entity!\nAnd also because your wishes come to be true in your dreams and only in your dreams!\nBut do not fall into identification. Be a witness.\nRemain aware.\nAnd, then, suddenly there will be no dreaming. And, only you.\nAnd, Illumination.\n16-5-1971\n(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)\n29/ Authentic Being - Through Meditation Beloved Dhyana Siddhi,\nLove. It is tragic but true that few people ever possess their souls.\nThey possess everything except themselves.\nAnd, then, naturally they just become a thing among their other things.\nAnd the possessor becomes the possessed.\n\"Nothing is more rare in any man,\" says Emerson, \"than an act of his own\".\nBut this is just what can be expected. Because, no one is ones own.\nNo one is oneself.\nMost people are other people.\nThey are not living - but only acting roles given to them by others.\nTheir thoughts are someone else's opinions. And, their faces are just masks.\nThey are faceless.\nThey have no authentic being at all. There lives: a mimicry.\nAnd, their passions: a quotation.\nBreak this vicious circle otherwise you will never BE. Break this through meditation.\nAnd, it cannot be broken by anything else. Because through mind it cannot be broken. And except meditation, all else is mind.\nMind is the prison. Meditation: The Door. And the only door.\n19- 4 -1971\n(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)\n30/ The Gateless Gate My beloved,\nLove. That which is never lost cannot be found. And to search for it is absurd.\nBut, the moment this absurdity is understood, all seeking stops by itself.\nAnd that which is never lost is found!\nThat is why I say: seek and you will not find.\nBecause, the very seeking is the barrier.\nThe search itself is the hindrance.\nBecause it creates the seeker, the Ego, the illusion that I am.\nAnd, I am not.\nDo not seek and you will find it - the I-am-not-ness.\nThis nothingness is the gate.\nThe gateless Gate.\nRiko, once, asked Nansen to explain to him the old problem of the goose in the bottle.\n\"If a man puts a goosling into the bottle\", he said, \"and feeds the goosling through the bottleneck until it grows and grows and becomes a goose, and then there just is no more room inside the bottle, how can the man get it out without killing the goose, or breaking the bottle?\" \"RICO!\" shouted Nansen, and gave a great clap with his hands.\n\"Yes, Master\", said Rico with a start.\n\"SEE!” said Nansen \"the goose is out!\"\n25-4-1971\n(To, Shree Inderraj Anand, 10/E, Ben Niwas, Warden Road, Bombay-26)\n","wordCount":"6184","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eigenaar"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/the_gateless_gate/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Microsoft Word - The Gateless Gate</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6184 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Eigenaar&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/The_Gateless_Gate/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 style=padding-top:2pt;padding-left:13pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=the-gateless-gate>THE GATELESS GATE</h1><p>(Collection of Thirty Immortal Letters)</p><p><br></p><p>Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</p><p><br></p><p>Compilation and Editing:</p><h3 style=text-indent:0;text-align:right id=swami-yoga-chinmaya>Swami Yoga Chinmaya</h3><p><br></p><p>A Life Awakening Movement Publication, Bombay.</p><p>Publisher:</p><h4 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:27pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=lshwarlal-n.-shah>lshwarlal N.

Death Through Acceptance</h2><p>Beloved Dhyana Siddhi, Love. Fear cripples consciousness.</p><p>And, fear is the source of unconsciousness.</p><p>That is why without transcending fear, no one can attain to full
consciousness.</p><p>But what is fear?</p><p>Fear is awareness of death without knowing what death is! Fear exists
in the gap between you and your death.</p><p>And if there is no gap, no space, then there is no fear.</p><p>Do not think death as something outside you. Because it is not.</p><p>And do not think death as something in the future. Because it is
not.</p><p>Death is within you.</p><p>Because death is the other side of life. Life cannot exist without
death.</p><p>They both belong to the same energy as positive and negative
poles.</p><p>So do not identify yourself with life, because you are both. The
identification with life creates the gap.</p><p>And, death has nothing to do with future it is always here and
now.</p><p>Every moment it is.</p><p>And, when one ceases to regard it as something outside oneself and,
so to speak, draws it into his consciousness</p><p>and assimilates the idea of it, one is completely changed. He is in
all truth, born again.</p><p>And, then, there is no fear. Because then there is no gap.</p><p><br></p><p>15-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=kneeling-down-of-the-ego>27/ Kneeling Down of the Ego</h2><p>Beloved Dhyana Siddhi, Love. We kneel down to ourselves.</p><p>Because, we kneel down to the gods we make out of our experience or
out of our desires and dreams, or out of our so called logic and foolish
arguments.</p><p>This is neither humility, nor prayer.</p><p>Rather, on the contrary this is the most egoistic attitude
possible.</p><p>The true religious mind is one which just kneels down, not to anyone,
not to any IMAGE in particular.</p><p>This kneeling down is nothing but a flowering of one's own total
nothingness.</p><p>Then this kneeling down becomes an inner way of life. And, unless
prayer is such, prayer is not.</p><p>One cannot pray, one can only be prayerful.</p><p><br></p><p>15-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=meditation-of-conscious-dreaming>28/ Meditation of Conscious
Dreaming</h2><p><br></p><p>Beloved dhyana siddhi,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Use dreaming consciously as meditation. And, know well that
<em>conscious dreaming opens new doors of perception.</em></p><p>Lie down, relax and dream. But do not fall asleep.</p><p>Remain conscious in the background. Wait and watch.</p><p>Dream anything that happens to your mind. Do not plan beforehand.</p><p>Dream anything because in dream the whole world is yours.</p><p>Dream your existence as you please. Dream and be content.</p><p>Content with your dreams, because they are yours and remember that
nothing can be yours like your dreams, because you yourself are a
dream-entity!</p><p>And also because your wishes come to be true in your dreams and only
in your dreams!</p><p>But do not fall into identification. Be a witness.</p><p>Remain aware.</p><p>And, then, suddenly there will be no dreaming. And, only you.</p><p>And, Illumination.</p><p><br></p><p>16-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=authentic-being---through-meditation>29/ Authentic Being - Through
Meditation</h2><p>Beloved Dhyana Siddhi,</p><p>Love. It is tragic but true that few people ever possess their
souls.</p><p>They possess everything except themselves.</p><p>And, then, naturally they just become a thing among their other
things.</p><p>And the possessor becomes the possessed.</p><p>"Nothing is more rare in any man," says Emerson, "than an act of his
own".</p><p>But this is just what can be expected. Because, no one is ones
own.</p><p>No one is oneself.</p><p>Most people are other people.</p><p>They are not living - but only acting roles given to them by
others.</p><p>Their thoughts are someone else's opinions. And, their faces are just
masks.</p><p>They are faceless.</p><p>They have no authentic being at all. There lives: a mimicry.</p><p>And, their passions: a quotation.</p><p>Break this vicious circle otherwise you will never BE. Break this
through meditation.</p><p>And, it cannot be broken by anything else. Because through mind it
cannot be broken. And except meditation, all else is mind.</p><p>Mind is the prison. Meditation: The Door. And the only door.</p><p><br></p><p>19- 4 -1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To: Ma Dhyana Siddhi, New York, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-gateless-gate-2>30/ The Gateless Gate</h2><p><br></p><p>My beloved,</p><p>Love. That which is never lost cannot be found. And to search for it
is <em>absurd.</em></p><p>But, the moment this absurdity is understood, all seeking stops by
itself.</p><p>And that which is never lost is found!</p><p>That is why I say: <em>seek and you will not find.</em></p><p>Because, <em>the very seeking is the barrier.</em></p><p>The search itself is the hindrance.</p><p>Because it creates the seeker, the Ego, the illusion that I am.</p><p>And, I am not.</p><p>Do not seek and you will find it - the <em>I-am-not-ness.</em></p><p>This nothingness is the gate.</p><p>The gateless Gate.</p><p>Riko, once, asked Nansen to explain to him the old problem of the
goose in the bottle.</p><p>"If a man puts a goosling into the bottle", he said, "and feeds the
goosling through the bottleneck until it grows and grows and becomes a
goose, and then there just is no more room inside the bottle, how can
the man get it out without killing the goose, or breaking the bottle?"
"RICO!" shouted Nansen, and gave a great clap with his hands.</p><p>"Yes, Master", said Rico with a start.</p><p>"SEE!” said Nansen "the goose is out!"</p><p><br></p><p>25-4-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To, Shree Inderraj Anand, 10/E, Ben Niwas, Warden Road,

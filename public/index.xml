‌CHAPTER 1
During his discourses on the AKSHYA UPANISHAD
“This is worth considering. It is significant. The first thing to understand is that except for man, no animal is capable of laughter. So laughter shows a very high peak in the evolution of life. If you go out on the street and see a buffalo laughing, you will be scared to death. And if you report it, then nobody will believe that it can happen.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I’m changing all the time... Since the group, I don’t know... I don’t like talking, I don’t like laughing... I feel like crying... ]
Whatsoever happens, accept and enjoy, and don’t force anything. If you feel like talking, talk. If you feel like being silent, be silent – just move with the feeling.</description>

No, you ask... that is a way of making up your mind, mm? Now you are part of me and I am as much involved in you as you are – even more.</description>

1 February 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho gives sannyas:]
Just raise your hands, close your eyes, and feel utterly open. These hands are the gestures of openness. Feel receptive, because sannyas has to be received; you cannot take it, you can only receive it. It is a gift: you can allow it to happen. There is no need to grab it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA
The guest, the host, the white chrysanthemum... these are the moments, the white roses, when no one should speak.
Neither the guest, nor the host... only silence.
But silence speaks in its own way, sings its own song of joy, of peace, of beauty and blessings; otherwise there would not have been a TAO TE CHING, nor would there have been a SERMON ON THE MOUNT.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I’m not sure which direction to take – whether to go out more to people or to go inside myself more. I’m not sure which is best for my growth.
Osho checks his energy.]
Good, come back. The energy is really good.
You have to do both. Choosing won’t be good.</description>

Question 1
OSHO, I HAVE READ YOUR LITERATURE; I HAVE HEARD YOU. YOUR LANGUAGE HAS HYPNOTIC CHARM AND IS VERY CLEAR. SOMETIMES YOU SPEAK ON MAHAVIRA, SOMETIMES ON KRISHNA OR BUDDHA AND SOMETIMES YOU TELL ABOUT JESUS AND MOHAMMED AS WELL. YOU DIVULGE THE SECRETS OF THE GITA IN A MOST INSPIRING MANNER, YOU GIVE DISCOURSES ON THE UPANISHADS AND THE VEDAS, AND YOU WOULD NOT HESITATE TO GO TO TEMPLES OR CHURCHES TO GIVE DISCOURSES.</description>

1 March 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho initiates the new baby of a sannyasin.]
Deva means divine, sangam means meeting. Each child is a meeting of the sky and the earth. Each child is a miracle. Something happens that should not ordinarily happen: the meeting of matter and consciousness, the meeting of the visible and the invisible. So think of him as a miracle.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1 September 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love and patanga is a special moth that is very much attracted to fire, flame, and whenever there is flame the moth will come and jump into it. Its only love is fire. And hence the name ‘patanga’ has become a metaphor in the east – a metaphor for the lover. A lover has to be like the moth – ready to jump into fire, ready to die, ready to disappear.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1 August 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem Birgitta. Prem means love; birgitta means strength, power, energy.
Love makes you strong, makes you powerful, because love transforms your possibilities into actualities. It transforms the seed into a sprout, it transforms the potential into the real. Without love one is empty, with love one is overflowing. Without love one is a beggar, with love one is an emperor.</description>

1 July 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, renu means dust – love dust.
But once dust is of love it is divine. Love transforms it: then it is no more dust; it is dust only if love is missing. If love is missing then man is nothing but dust. Once love enters into life, dust becomes aflame with the divine.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1 April 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem kutera. It means a small shrine of love, a small hut of love, a small space for love. Prem means love and kutera means a small place. And that’s all that a man needs to be fulfilled: if one can become a small shrine, nothing is lacking.
The very phenomenon of love integrates you, and when love is missing, you start falling apart – it is the glue that keeps you together.</description>

7 April 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[To a sannyasin, a film-producer who is returning to the States, Osho said that meditation could be introduced to many people through the medium of film and television.]
Books are very old media. The days for books are gone. People don’t have that much time to read, because reading is active; you have to do something.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, USA
It is a beautiful morning. Again and again the sun rises and it is always new. It never grows old. Scientists say it is millions of years old; nonsense! Every day I see it. It is always new. Nothing is old. But scientists are grave-diggers, that’s why I say they look so grave, serious. This morning, again the miracle of existence.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
12 October 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, and tyagi means renunciation. Tyagi means one who has renounced – love and renunciation. I make a special condition for renunciation – and that is love. A man can renounce out of anger, a man can renounce out of hatred, a man can renounce out of frustration... but then it is meaningless.</description>

1 September 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, aikanta means aloneness. Self-knowledge is possible only in deep aloneness. Ordinarily whatever we know about ourselves is the opinion of others. They say “You are good” and we think we are good. They say “You are beautiful” and we think we are beautiful. They say you are bad or ugly... whatsoever people say about us we go on collecting.</description>

10 December 1975 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[To the leader of the Tathata group (Unconditional Acceptance Seminar)]
It has to be remembered that the leader is not, in fact, a manipulator. He should not be. If you manipulate, then it is something from the mind, and that which comes from the mind cannot go deeper than the mind. So the leader has to be open to the beyond.</description>

Deva means divine, Madhyama means the middle – the divine middle. The extreme is the disease, and the mind lives through the extremes. The mind always thinks in terms of either/or, and reality is just exactly in the middle. It is never either/or; it is both/and. It is neither day nor night, neither life nor death, neither body nor soul.</description>

SESSION 1
Never act out of fear. Don’t be worried about my body, it is okay. Don’t listen to my body but to me. My body is always a little strange... it’s bound to be.
Once you are aware, the body starts losing its grip over the consciousness. Once you are aware, you are no more of this world.</description>

[A visitor asked what the agreement of sannyas meant.]
That you are no more. It is a total surrender. No agreement – because in an agreement there are two parties. You simply surrender. Much courage is needed...
It is not an agreement because it is not a legal thing. It is just a love affair.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
1 January 1966
Fearlessness is the first condition for the life of spiritualism. One who cannot take courage to that, cannot dive deep into his own self. The courage which is required for going alone in dark nights, in darkness and in unknown and fierce path, a greater courage than that is required to go into the self, because it breaks the sweet dreams which one has built up about his own self and because as one has to face such ugly and condemnable sins from which one has taken himself to he entirely free.</description>

‌CHAPTER 1
PREFACE
I too am a farmer and I sowed some seeds. They sprouted and now flowers have come to them. My whole life is filled with the fragrance of these flowers and because of this fragrance now I am in a different world. This fragrance has given me a new birth, and now I am no longer that which is seen by ordinary eyes.</description>

Satyo Dorothee. Satyo means truth; Dorothee means a gift of God.
Truth is never an achievement; one cannot seek and search it. Seeking is a sure way of not finding it. Search and you will miss, because the very idea of searching, seeking, is rooted in desire, and desire is the barrier.
Truth happens when there is no desire in the mind.</description>

Khabira. It is a sufi name, a name of God. Literally it means: one who sees all, the cognizant one, the seer of all. And that is hidden in everybody – the witness. What we see may be true, may not be true, but the seer is always true. The seen may be, may not be.</description>

29 May 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A sannyasin returning to the West, said that he was feeling ‘okay’ about himself.]
Okay is not enough... feel blessed. Okay is not a very ecstatic word; it is just lukewarm. So feel blessed – and it is a question of feeling. Whatsoever you feel, you become. It is your responsibility.
If you are not feeling good, that’s how you have created it in the past.</description>

I also wanted to hear that music. Therefore, I went in search of that sea. After several years of wandering, at last I did reach that sea-shore. But, behold what was there was the loud tumult of the sea. The strokes waves, after striking on the rocks, were resounding manifold in that lonely place. Neither was there any music nor were the ringing bells of the temples.</description>

Remember only one thing: the past is a hindrance, the greatest hindrance. It has to be completely dropped, utterly dropped. To be with me is to be in the now – no past, no future. This moment is all there is and just this moment is god. Everything else is just the mind dreaming, desiring, imagining.</description>

Anand means bliss, blissfulness, and buddha means the awakened state of consciousness – the utterly awakened state when there is no more any unconscious desire, when there is no dark corner left, when all is consciousness within... when the conscious goes on spreading, spreading, and takes over the whole territory of the unconscious.</description>

Michael means one who is godlike, and anando means blissful. One is basically divine because all is divine. To exist is to be divine, to be alive is to be divine, to breathe is to be divine. Hence trees are divine and the rocks and the birds and the people – whatsoever is. Divinity is another name of isness.</description>

Veet means beyond, nastiko means no – beyond no-saying. The religions in the past have been teaching people a kind of negative attitude. The old religions depend on the don’t: don’t do this, don’t do that. Their whole approach is: How to negate life? They think that by negating life they will be a coming closer to god, and that is just absurd.</description>

Prem means love, elli is Hebrew; it means goddess – goddess of love. In fact God and love are synonymous. To be in love is to be in God. To know love is to know God. There is no other proof for God except love, and there is no other worship either. All other temples and churches are false, pseudo, except for the temple of love.</description>

1 January 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Sat means truth, being, existence, rahasya means mystery, mysteriousness. Truth is mysterious. It cannot be known, it is unknowable... not unknown but unknowable, because the unknown can be known some day, will be known some day, but truth can never be known. That’s its intrinsic quality. Remove one veil and you find another. Remove another and you find still more, and it goes on ad infinitum.</description>

Anand means bliss, christopher means Christ-bearer. The story is that Saint Christopher bore the Christ child across the river. But it can become a tremendously significant metaphor for the inner journey. The meaning that I would like to give it is that each person, man or woman, is a Christbearer in the sense that everybody is pregnant with Christ, that we are carrying the child in our womb.</description>

OSHO, WHAT EXACTLY, IN SIMPLE WORDS, ARE YOU TRYING TO TEACH? WHAT IS YOUR EXACT MESSAGE TO HUMANITY AT LARGE? – AGAIN IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND.
WALK WITHOUT FEET
FLY WITHOUT WINGS AND THINK WITHOUT MIND
THAT’S MY TEACHING. It cannot be made more exact than that.</description>

From Dependence Towards Truth
25 February 1969 pm in
Enchanted by the song of a bird singing happily on the branch of a tree, a king had it caught and kept in a cage. Even singing is wrong in the presence of wrong people. The poor bird could not have imagined that his song would get him behind bars! The bird that flew in abandon in the free skies and flitted from one branch to another as he wished, now found himself in a golden cage, inlaid with precious stones to one who has tasted the freedom of the skies?</description>

Deva means divine, and agyana means ignorance; divine ignorance. And this has to be understood. All knowledge is superfluous. Knowledge as such is superfluous. And all knowledge creates only an illusion that we know – we don’t know. You can live with a man your whole life, and you can think that you know him – and you don’t know him.</description>

Buddha means one who is enlightened, and prem means love – love for the enlightened one, or love for enlightenment.
Buddha is not a person – mm? it is a state of ultimate being. There have been many buddhas, and everybody is potentially a buddha. The word itself means tremendously awakened, absolutely alert.</description>

ANSWER: YOUR MIND IS IT. WHEN YOU SEE THE SELFSAME ESSENCE OF IT, YOU CAN CALL IT SUCHNESS. WHEN YOU SEE THE CHANGELESS NATURE OF IT, YOU CAN CALL IT DHARMAKAYA. IT DOES NOT BELONG TO ANYTHING; THEREFORE, IT IS CALLED EMANCIPATION. IT WORKS EASILY AND FREELY, NEVER BEING DISTURBED BY OTHERS; THEREFORE, IT IS CALLED THE TRUE PATH.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN YOUR VISION, IS CHARITY A PART OF RELIGIOUSNESS? IF SO, WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE CHARITY? FOLLOWING THE CATHOLIC CONCEPT, THE INDIAN LEGISLATURE SPECIFIES: 1) RELIEF FOR THE POOR, 2) EDUCATION, AND 3) MEDICAL RELIEF, AS BEING CHARITY.
WHAT IS THE CONCEPT OF CHARITY IN THE EYES OF A BUDDHA?</description>

Meditation: The Art of Celebration
Concentration is a choice. It excludes all except its object of concentration; it is a narrowing. If you are walking on the street, you will have to narrow your consciousness in order to walk. You cannot ordinarily be aware of all that is happening because if you are aware of everything that is happening you will become unfocused.</description>

Nonviolence

Violence is a disease of human beings, but it is not so for beasts. For beasts, it is their nature. There is no possibility of nonviolence at the level of beasts. That is why they haven’t got any idea of violence. Violence is the disease which man bas inherited from beasts, and it is a disease obstructing his evolving consciousness.</description>

Just be there and be totally there. It is not a question of where you are; the question is always of being total or partial. Whenever you are partial, something goes on missing.

Seven Valleys
27 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
THERE WAS ONCE A WOMAN WHO ABANDONED THE RELIGION IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP. SHE LEFT THE RANKS OF THE ATHEISTS TOO, AND JOINED ANOTHER FAITH. THEN SHE BECAME CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF YET ANOTHER. EACH TIME SHE CHANGED HER BELIEFS, SHE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD GAINED SOMETHING, BUT NOT QUITE ENOUGH.</description>

Sex, the genesis of love
28 August 1968 pm in Gowalior Tank Maidan
Question 1 WHAT IS LOVE?
To feel it is easy, to define love is difficult indeed. If you ask a fish what the sea is like, the fish will say, “This is the sea. The sea is all around. And that’s that.” But if you insist – “Please define the sea” – then the problem becomes very difficult indeed.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO YOU CALL YOUR RELIGION THE FIRST AND THE LAST RELIGION?
It is a little difficult for me to speak again. It has been difficult always, because I have been trying to speak the unspeakable. Now it is even more so.</description>

I AM ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY EASTERN SCRIPTURES THAT BEGIN WITH OM, SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH AND END WITH OM, SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH.
WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?

Surrendering to What Is
6 April 1973 pm in Bikaner Palace Hotel
Three sutras that are basic for life transformation, that are ultimate in a way. The first: Be nonambitious.
KILL OUT AMBITION TOTALLY.
UNLESS AMBITION IS KILLED, you will remain in misery. Ambition is the source of all miseries. What is ambition? ‘A’ wants to be ‘B’, the poor wants to be rich, the ugly wants to be beautiful.</description>

The mirror
16 September 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER,
WHEN NANGAKU FIRST SAW MA TZU, HE RECOGNIZED HIM BY INTUITION AS A VESSEL OF THE DHARMA.
HE VISITED MA TZU IN HIS CELL WHERE HE WAS MEDITATING, AND ASKED HIM: “IN PRACTICING SITTING MEDITATION, WHAT DOES YOUR REVERENCE ASPIRE TO ATTAIN?”
“TO ATTAIN BUDDHAHOOD” WAS MA TZU’S REPLY.</description>

To study the way ... to forget the self ...

OUR BELOVED MASTER, DOGEN WROTE:
TO STUDY THE WAY IS TO STUDY THE SELF. TO STUDY THE SELF IS TO FORGET THE SELF. TO FORGET THE SELF IS TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY ALL THINGS. TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY ALL THINGS IS TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS BETWEEN ONE’S SELF AND OTHERS.</description>

When The Shoe Fits

CHU’I THE DRAFTSMAN COULD DRAW MORE PERFECT CIRCLES FREEHAND THAN WITH A COMPASS.
HIS FINGERS BROUGHT FORTH SPONTANEOUS FORMS FROM NOWHERE. HIS MIND WAS MEANWHILE FREE AND WITHOUT CONCERN WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING.
NO APPLICATION WAS NEEDED, HIS MIND WAS PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND KNEW NO OBSTACLE.
SO, WHEN THE SHOE FITS, THE FOOT IS FORGOTTEN, WHEN THE BELT FITS, THE BELLY IS FORGOTTEN, WHEN THE HEART IS RIGHT, ‘FOR’ AND ‘AGAINST’ ARE FORGOTTEN.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW CAN WE SAVE HUMANITY FROM FALLING EVEN MORE?
It is one of the trade secrets of all the religions to propose propaganda that humanity has to be saved.
It is a very strange idea, but it is so old that nobody seems to look into the implications.</description>

27 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU REALLY THINK ZEN IS FULL OF ZEST, ZIP, ZAP AND ZING?
Samadhi,
Zen is not a religion, it is living life in its totality, herenow. Religions are always postponing life: they are giving you beautiful illusions about life somewhere in the future, far away, beyond death.</description>

You go on throwing the responsibility outside, but that is just an excuse. Yes, it is triggered from the outside but the outside does not create it. Somebody insults you: the insult comes from the outside but the anger is inside you.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I’ve been really rebellious and resistent to you. Whenever you say something in the lecture that I don t like, I cough. It is not as deliberate as all that, but I’ve discovered there’s a very close connection.]
Very good! This is a good discovery! [The sannyasin continues: And I like you]</description>

10 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, Arie means black – divine blackness. Black is symbolic of death. It is also symbolic of infinity, of the mysterious, of the uncaused.
Light has to be caused. Light needs fuel; once the fuel is finished light is gone. Darkness is eternal. It needs no cause, no fuel: it is simply there.</description>

You have not followed anything up to now. It was just a game that you were in. First pass through a few group therapies then I will decide what path you can follow.</description>

[A sannyasin said he found life easier in the West, and it was difficult for him to be totally here.
Osho said he should go and live out the fantasies he had been having, but that the moment he reached the States he would start thinking about Poona. He said it was good to go and be finished with those things he felt incomplete, and that he would find that there was a vast difference between reality and fantasy.</description>

YOU HAVE SAID THAT EDUCATING THE INTELLECT OF THE CHILDREN IS A MUST. BUT SHOULD THEY ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY BE TAUGHT MEDITATION? MANY SANNYASINS HAVE FAMILIES; WHAT SHOULD THEIR APPROACH BE WITH THEIR CHILDREN?</description>

10 June 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand Rosalba. Anand means bliss; Rosalba means a white rose. Bliss is a white rose. It is white because white is the combination of all the colors. White represents totality. White is the most positive phenomenon, just as the black is the most negative. The black represents the absence of all colors, and white, the presence of all colors.</description>

Mujib. Prem means love, Mujib is a sufi name for God. It means ‘one who hears the prayer, the hearer of prayers.’ No prayer is ever lost, and if it is, that simply means it has not been done; it never means anything else. Your heart was not in it, it was only lip service.</description>

Deva means divine, prasthano means beginning – a divine beginning. Sannyas is a beginning, not the end – the first step but the most vital, the most radical. Even the last step will not be so radical, because the last comes of its own accord – the first has to be taken. It needs your decision, your commitment, your involvement.</description>

Anand Kaela. Anand means blissfulness; and if kaela has no meaning, then your name will mean a blissful meaninglessness. And that’s exactly what life is: it is utterly blissful but it has no meaning. It is blissful because it has no meaning.
To have meaning means to become a commodity, to have meaning means to become a thing.</description>

[veet artho – beyond meaning]
Truth has no meaning; all meaning is in man’s imagination, it is man’s projection. Reality simply is. There is no why and there is no way to find its why. But the mind feels very much disturbed by this meaninglessness, because it cannot exist without meaning, it lives on meaning.</description>

Anand means bliss, wajid is a Sufi word. It means intense yearning for god, a total longing for god, a passionate longing for god – not just a desire. A desire becomes a longing when you are ready to risk all for it. Even life seems to be less valuable than it.
Desires serve life; a life serves a longing.</description>

To go beyond doubt is the most fundamental step towards god. Doubt is a tremendously important method of enquiry into matter, but not into consciousness. It is utterly valid as far as matter is concerned, and utterly invalid as far as consciousness is concerned.

That is true mastery; to be master of others is really a poor substitute. People try to be masters of others because they are not masters of themselves. Once the self-mastery has happened, all desire to dominate, all desire to possess, all desire to be superior, simply disappears.</description>

A Single Shout
20 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IS THERE ANY PROOF FOR GOD?
I AM. You are. Everybody is. God is nothing but the totality. The trees are, the rivers are, the mountains are. These are the proofs. The sun rises in the morning and the moon is in the night, and the stars. These are the proofs.</description>

A Song Untouched by Time
10 July 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE CONTEMPORARY IDEAL OF LIVING COMPLETELY WITHIN THE PRESENT MOMENT, NO LESS THAN THE CLASSICAL MYSTICAL NOTION OF LIVING TOTALLY WITHIN THE DIVINE ETERNAL, IS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS IT IS INHUMAN. IT RESULTS IN A DISEASED RATHER THAN A GRACEFUL PRESENT. GRACEFUL EXISTENCE INTEGRATES PRESENT, PAST AND FUTURE.</description>

WHEN I LOOK AROUND YOUR COMMUNE AND SEE PEOPLE HUGGING THE WAY THEY DO, AND FEEL THE ENERGY I HAVE WHEN I HUG SOMEONE HERE, I WONDER WHY THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD. PLEASE COMMENT.
It cannot happen in the outside world, because for centuries man has been conditioned against the body.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
CLERGYMAN OLDS GRANDLUND FROM SWEDEN HAS ASKED YOU A QUESTION. THE QUESTION HAS MANY QUESTIONS, SO I HAVE SEPARATED THEM. HE SAYS, “BELOVED OSHO, I HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT ABOUT MOTHER TERESA.”

Jesus used to teach his disciples, particularly the two fishermen who became his first disciples, how to catch men instead of catching fish.</description>

Buddha and the Beast
30 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT EXACTLY IS MAN?
MAN IS A MERE PERHAPS, A POSSIBILITY, A POTENTIAL, a becoming, a longing. Man is not yet. Man has to be. That’s the agony of man, and the ecstasy too. The beast is – there is no growth possible. It is a finished product. There is no possibility to seek and search and be.</description>

Christianity: just a nice Jewish boy’s hang-up
8 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
YOU SAY CHRIST WAS THE LAST CHRISTIAN. ARE YOU THE LAST RAJNEESHEE? PLEASE EXPLAIN.
IT was not me who said that Christ was the last Christian. I was simply quoting Friedrich Nietzsche; it was Nietzsche who made that statement. In a certain sense Nietzsche is absolutely right, because in this world no individual is ever repeated.</description>

I am talking about all this nonsense to make you aware that whenever you come across the same kind of nonsense again somewhere else -- beware! Don&#39;t get caught in it.

7 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCEPTING MYSELF AND LOVING MYSELF?
THERE is great difference between the two. Accepting yourself is a much lower state of consciousness – better, of course, than rejecting yourself. It is a medicine; the disease is rejection. And anything medicinal has no permanent or ultimate value; its value is only in curing the disease.</description>

Maneesha, Badarayana’s statement, “athato brahma jigyasa” is one of the most potential statements ever made. It means, “Now begins the inquiry into the ultimate.” It is the first statement in his BRAHMASUTRA: MAXIMS ABOUT THE ULTIMATE, one of the greatest mystic books in the world.</description>

WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED BEING DISSOLVES INTO THE COSMOS, DOES HIS UNIQUENESS DISSOLVE ALSO?
The enlightened man, even while he is alive in the body, has already dissolved. He knows that he is no more, he knows that he is a nothingness. The dissolution has already happened. In fact, nothing has dissolved, because nothing had been separate from the very beginning.</description>

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAITING FOR THE SHIP TO COME IN, AND BEING PASSIVE AND FATALISTIC?
Satyam Svarup, the difference between waiting for the ship to come, and being passive and fatalistic is immense, although very delicate.
The fatalistic mind does not believe in the individual’s own freedom, does not believe in the individual’s own longing and search.</description>

WHY IS EVERY HUMAN BEING FULL OF PROBLEMS AND UNHAPPY?
THE FIRST THING: because man can be tremendously happy, the possibility exists, hence, his unhappiness. Nobody else – no animal, no bird, no tree, no rock – can be so happy as man. The possibility, the tremendous possibility that you can be happy, eternally happy, that you can be at the top of a bliss mountain, creates unhappiness.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
I love the rascal saints
9 January 1986 pm in Kathmandu, Nepal
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A SAINT CAN BE A RASCAL?
The question reminds me of a small story – it happened in a Christian monastery. Two monks were discussing in the garden of the monastery – every day they were given one hour to walk in the garden and meditate on God.</description>

If You Take the Whole out of the Whole
Date Unknown
Question
HOW CAN WE BECOME ONE WITH THE REALITY AND WHY ARE WE SEPARATE FROM IS?
The division is something that we ourselves have created. Reality has always been one; it has never known any division. All division is a mental division, a creation of our own conditioning. Reality has always been undivided, indivisible.</description>

Ignorance Will Show You The Way
8 April 1971 pm in Mt. Abu, Rajasthan, India
THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE PATH OF IGNORANCE ENTER DARKNESS;
AND THOSE WHO ARE ABSORBED IN KNOWLEDGE ENTER A GREATER DARKNESS.
This sutra makes a profound proclamation of the truth – a very bold proclamation. Such an announcement can be made only by a sage. It is declared that those who tread on the path of ignorance lose their way and wander here and there in this world; but those who walk on the path of knowledge – that is, the path of “I know” – lose themselves in greater darkness.</description>

Question 1
THE WEST HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO ARISTOTLE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER, CAMUS, BERDYAEV, MARCEL AND SARTRE. IS IT GOING TO GIVE BIRTH TO BUDDHAS BY ITSELF OR IS A COMMUNION WITH THE EASTERN CONSCIOUSNESS NEEDED?
CHINMAYA, THE BUDDHA-CONSCIOUSNESS is neither Eastern nor Western. It has nothing to do with geography or history, it has nothing to do with mind as such.</description>

5 June 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS THE RELIGION OF A REBELLIOUS SPIRIT?
Maneesha, the rebellious spirit can be religious, but cannot have a religion. And the difference between the two is immense, unbridgeable.
To be religious is an experience, just like love. It is an encounter with the totality of existence.</description>

OSHO, WHICH IS THE REAL QUESTION?
Sudhir,
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS ARE ALL REAL, because they are answerable. Religious questions are all unreal because they are unanswerable.
Religion is the concern with the unanswerable. To ask a religious question is basically wrong – it is wrong because religion is the search for the mystery, not the search for the answer.</description>

Whenever you have time just sit silently with closed eyes. If these two things are attained you become a sannyasin!</description>

10 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means blissful, yoganidra means a certain kind of sleep that only is possible in deep yoga.
The ordinary sleep has dreams; yoganidra has no dreams. In the ordinary sleep you become unconscious. In yoganidra you still retain your consciousness, you still remain alert. You know that you are fast asleep, but that knowing remains.</description>

I FEEL LOST – THERE IS NO WAY BACK TO MY OLD LIFE – THE BRIDGES ARE BROKEN. AND I DON’T SEE A WAY IN FRONT OF ME.
THERE is none. The way is just an illusion of the mind. The mind goes on dreaming about the way to reach its goals, its desires.</description>

When a Buddha becomes a Buddha or a Christ becomes a Christ, these sutras are revealed. If you can understand them, even understanding will transform you.</description>

Anand means bliss, happiness, and abodha means innocence; innocent bliss. And remember this – that bliss is never knowledgeable, and a man of knowledge is never blissful. Only innocent people can be blissful, only children can be blissful. Those who don’t know, only they can be blissful. The more you know, the less is the possibility of being blissful.</description>

It is a very natural phenomenon. Religion is the ultimate luxury.

That is why I can initiate anyone into sannyas. To me, initiation itself is a play. And I will not ask for any qualifications – whether you are qualified or not – because qualifications are asked when something serious is done. Just by existing everyone is qualified enough to play, and even if he is unqualified to be a sannyasin it makes no difference, because the whole thing is just a play.</description>

The Bodhisattvas’ Merciful Vow
8 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE MIND WHICH IS UNATTACHED TO ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD, DOES NOT THINK, DOES NOT FEEL, IS FLUID AND FLEXIBLE.
ALL BUDDHAS AND BODHISATTVAS ACHIEVE BUDDHAHOOD AND NIRVANA AS A RESULT
OF THE MERCIFUL VOW. THE BUDDHA-NATURE
MEANS NON-BIRTH, NON-EXTINCTION; THEN KNOW THAT ILLUSION
IS BIRTH, DEATH, REINCARNATION.
THOUGH YOU PRACTISE VIRTUE,</description>

Question 1
UNTIL THE JEWS AND ARABS AND OTHER TRIBES BROUGHT THEIR RACIALLY EXCLUSIVE AND JEALOUS GOD TO THE WEST, TOAMY, BACCHUS, MITHROS AND APOLLO WERE THE GODS THAT MAN WORSHIPPED. DIANA HAD HER BOW AND ARROW, THOR WAS IN THE NORTH, THE MOTHER GODDESS WAS WORSHIPPED IN THE WEST. AND THEN DEATH AND RESURRECTION BECAME THE RELIGION OF THE WEST.</description>

The cause of your misery
4 January 1974 pm in
The first question:
Question 1
HOW IS IT THAT YOU DESCRIBE THE LIFE THAT IS REALLY OURS, AND WHICH YOU HAVE TRANSCENDED, SO CORRECTLY AND IN EVERY DETAIL, WHILE WE REMAIN SO IGNORANT OF IT? IS IT NOT PARADOXICAL?
It looks paradoxical, it is not – because you can understand only when you have transcended.</description>

20 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
ARE YOU THE ONLY ENLIGHTENED PERSON IN THIS ASHRAM? IF YES, IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ENLIGHTEN OR TO BE ENLIGHTENED NEAR AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON?
SINCE I BECAME ENLIGHTENED I have never come across a person who is not enlightened. You see only that which you are. Before I became enlightened, the same was the case with me – the whole world used to appear tremendously asleep, in darkness, in death, unenlightened, because you are reflected continuously everywhere.</description>

The Farewell
8 June 1964 am
One and only one moment of determination, of sankalpa, of complete determination is enough, whereas a whole life without it is nothing. Remember it is not time but determination that is the important thing. The achievements of the world are accomplished in the realm of time and those of truth in the realm of determination. Sankalpa, determination, must live in your sadhana.</description>

OSHO, WHAT IS THE GOAL OF MEDITATION?
Prageeta,
THERE IS NO GOAL OF MEDITATION. Meditation is the dropping of all goals, hence it can’t have a goal of its own; that would be against its very nature. Goals exist in the future; meditation is to be in the present.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
TO ME ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC FALLS OF MAN TODAY IS HIS VALUING ALL THE WRONG THINGS. SOMEWHERE IN THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS THERE MUST BE SOME IDEA OF WANTING ALL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS OF LIFE FOR FREE – AND PAYING HUGELY FOR ALL THE UNESSENTIALS.</description>

IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY, THE NATURE OF ULTIMATE TRUTH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS TRUTH, SATYAM, BEAUTY, SUNDRAM AND GOODNESS, SHIVAM. ARE THESE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD?
These are not the qualities of God. Rather, they are our experiences of God. They do not belong to the divine as such; they are our perceptions.</description>

UNDERSTANDING NEVER COMES, neither as a sudden phenomenon nor as a gradual one, because it is always there. You have it right now. It is not going to happen somewhere in the future. You are carrying it within you, just as a seed carries the tree, a woman carries a child.</description>

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELIEF IN A MESSIAH AND TRUST IN A SPIRITUAL MASTER?
Belief is blind. It has no rational proofs for it. It is based in your psychological need, it has no objective proof. You want to believe because without belief you feel empty, just a driftwood going nowhere.</description>

Anand means bliss or blissfulness; iti means this or thisness – this is it. Bliss is not far away, it is close by; not even close by but within you, not even within you: you are it. The mind always thinks of that; the existence is this. The mind always desires the far away, the distant, and hence it goes on missing; it becomes too obsessed with the far away.</description>

Everything is possible, possibilities are infinite. Materialisation is possible and de-materialisation is possible. In fact it is happening all the time.
There was a time when the earth was not there, then it materialised. And there are stars which are disappearing, de-materialising. Now physicists say that when a star de-materialises it leaves an empty hole in its place, a black hole – just emptiness is left and the whole of the matter simply disappears.</description>

Anand means bliss, devada means God-given. Bliss is never attained through human effort. It is a grace, not an achievement, so the achiever’s mind goes on missing it. And our society creates the ambitious, achieving mind; hence so much misery in the world. It is a natural consequence of our approach towards life. We are aggressive towards life, and bliss comes only to those who are receptive.</description>

11 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, Alan means harmony. Harmony is bliss; bliss is another name of harmony. Misery is discord. Existence is always in harmony – it is only man who falls apart because of the ego, because of the idea of “I am”. He wants to create a world of his own, separate, private, hence he becomes a small island and loses contact with the total.</description>

11 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Geet means song – a song of love. Life is barren unless the song of love arises in you. Life cannot become a fulfilment unless the song of love happens. Life in itself remains meaningless. It is love that gives meaning to it. Make love as deep as possible; that very depth becomes God one day.</description>

Veet Lynne. Veet means going beyond; Lynne means idols – going beyond all idols: idols of religion, idols of race, idols of nation. They all make us idolators, and a religious person really cannot be a worshipper of an idol. He wants the real.
The idol is only a symbol. To be trapped by the symbol is the misery of man, and all men are trapped by symbols.</description>

NOTHINGNESS CAN EITHER BE just emptiness or it can be a tremendous fullness. It can be negative, it can be positive. If it is negative it is like death, darkness. Religions have called it hell. It is hell because there is no joy in it, no song in it, there is no heartbeat, no dance.</description>

Come back to existence
24 May 1973 pm in Bombay, India
IN RAIN DURING A BLACK NIGHT
ENTER THAT BLACKNESS AS THE FORM OF FORMS. WHEN A MOONLESS RAINY NIGHT IS NOT PRESENT, CLOSE EYES AND FIND BLACKNESS BEFORE YOU. OPENING EYES, SEE BLACKNESS.
SO FAULTS DISAPPEAR FOREVER. WHEREVER YOUR ATTENTION ALIGHTS, AT THIS VERY POINT,
EXPERIENCE.

Question 1 OSHO,
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR US? I FEEL ITS IMPORTANCE MORE AND MORE, BUT I AM ALSO CONFUSED ABOUT IT. AM I AVOIDING SOMETHING?
THE problem of responsibility is one of the most fundamental issues. But before we can go into it, a few words will have to be understood rightly.</description>

As among men Krishna baffles our understanding, so does Draupadi among women. and how the critics look at Draupadi says more about the critics themselves than about Draupadi.</description>

WHY IS COMMUNICATION SO DIFFICULT, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN LOVERS?
Premda, communication as such is difficult. Of course it is more difficult between lovers. But first you have to understand the general difficulty of communication. Each mind has been conditioned by different parents, different teachers, different priests, different politicians.</description>

And do not ask philosophical questions. Philosophical questions only seem to be questions, but they are not.</description>

OSHO, ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING YOU SAY, THE TITLE OF THIS SERIES, THEOLOGIA MYSTICA, SEEMS TO BE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.
Yoga Anurag,
IT is true, but the title was given by Dionysius himself, so at least I am not responsible for it. In a way, mysticism is bound to be a contradiction in terms, whether the word theologia is in it or not.</description>

IS ENLIGHTENMENT BEYOND THE NATURE OF THINGS?
Milarepa, enlightenment is the very nature of things. But it has never been said that way; on the contrary, people’s minds have been corrupted by creating a goal against nature, giving it beautiful names, “supernature.” And man was caught in this because of a very simple reason:</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN DOES THE DISCIPLE’S FREEDOM BECOME HIS MASTER’S CONDEMNATION?
Milarepa, the authentic disciple has never condemned the master. In fact, he cannot condemn the master; the master has become his own heart and being.
To condemn the master is to condemn oneself. But yes, there are so-called disciples.</description>

Total Desire: The Path to Desirelessness
Whatever we say and mean by life is just a journey toward death. If you can understand that your whole life is just a journey and nothing else, then you are less interested in life and more interested in death. And once someone becomes more interested in death, he can go deep into the very depths of life; otherwise, he is just going to remain on the surface.</description>

They are right – just their idea of utopia is not right. They think that utopia is something which cannot be achieved; that’s exactly the meaning of the word utopia.

It is simple, but it does miracles.</description>

13 March 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, lali means redness – redness of love. Red represents life, it represents blood, it represents passion. It is not only the colour of the flowers, it is not only the colour of the rising sun; it is also the colour of rising consciousness, of blooming consciousness. It is not only the colour of blood and the blood circulation; it is the colour of life flowing, circulating, moving.</description>

Anand means bliss, vasant means spring – bliss spring. And when bliss comes it comes like a spring. It was not there and suddenly it is there; suddenly the whole climate is different. It takes you unawares. It comes very unexpectedly, and one never knows from where it will start and begin. which tree will bloom first, will have the first taste of spring, nobody knows.</description>

Anand Liesbeth. Anand means bliss; liesbeth means one who worships God. The full name will mean a blissful worshipper of God.
God can be worshipped either out of fear or out of love. If the worship is out of fear it is false, it is a sheer wastage of time. The worship is true and significant only when it is out of love, when it is out of bliss, when it is out of gratitude.</description>

We are caught up in the non-essential, the mundane, the trivial. For the moment it looks so important, and the next moment it appears as if it had not happened at all.</description>

It is natural, so don’t feel in any way depressed by it. If you do, it is impossible to get rid of it because you lose all energy in it.

Veet means beyond, gyan means knowledge – beyond knowledge. God is beyond knowledge, it is intrinsically unknowable. The very effort to know it is a barrier in knowing it, because we can know something only if we are separate from it. Knowledge requires a division, the division between the object and the subject. Knowledge requires a kind of distance between the knower and the known, and that is not possible with god.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
12 May 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love and gatya means a river-like, dynamic quality.…
The english word ‘go’ comes from the same root ‘gatya’, ‘gathya’ – the quality that continuously moves.
Love is a moving energy. The moment you make it stop somewhere, it dies – then it becomes stagnant, it stinks. While love is moving it has tremendous beauty.</description>

13 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Niro means the element water. And water is very symbolic, symbolic of flow, symbolic of non- resistance, symbolic of let-go. And these have to become the qualities of a sannyasin.
One should never become stagnant, because life is a process, a constant process; the moment you stop the process you are dead. Life is a river, on-going, from infinity to infinity.</description>

Shanti means peace and garbha means womb – peace womb. This name is a seed-meditation for you. Think of yourself as a womb which is going to give birth to peace. Imagine, visualise yourself as being a womb, and that the peace child is growing within you. Whenever you are sitting, not doing anything, just visualise it – just sit silently.</description>

Deva means divine, anupam means uniqueness. It is a paradox – but existence itself is a paradox – that each individual is both universal and unique. It is very illogical, because if we are all one, then how can we all be unique? – we will be similar. But that is not the case.</description>

[A sannyasin explains her son’s name, Jolon: valley of the dead oak trees.]
Prem means love. Love and death are very deeply related. Love is a kind of death: it is the death of the ego. Those who are not capable of dying cannot be capable of love either, because it is the same phenomenon looked at from different angles.</description>

[Prem Udgita – love song]
Love is a song, the song of the heart, the song of your very innermost core; and unless love is born one is not born. It is through love that one attains the soul. It is only through love that one starts feeling something that is beyond the body, beyond matter, beyond form beyond words; and that beyond is god.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT EASTERN RELIGIONS, WORRIED THAT THEIR VITALITY CAN DESTROY THE NATIONS. IS THERE THIS DANGER/BLESSING WITH YOUR RELIGION TOO?
Religion is not geography. It is neither Eastern nor Western. It cannot be divided in such a stupid manner; otherwise there will be a Southern religion, a Northern religion, and there will be no end to these divisions.</description>

Gladly Beyond any Experience
22 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
THOUGH YOUR LECTURE WAS QUITE SERIOUS AND DEEP YESTERDAY, THERE WERE STRANGE TICKLES AND LAUGHTER ARISING IN ME. SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN, THERE WAS A SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A SUBTLE UNDERCURRENT. TEARS OFTEN ROLLED DOWN!
DO THE MOMENTS OF CLARITY AND INSIGHT GIVE BIRTH TO SENSE OF HUMOUR?</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT GOD IS ALSO SEARCHING FOR ME? CAN I WAIT FOR HIM TO FIND ME?
Sat Vijaya, it is absolutely true that just as you are seeking God or truth or the beloved, he is also seeking you. The search is never one-sided.</description>

9 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
ARE YOU AGAINST GOD AND JESUS CHRIST TOO? IT FREAKS ME OUT.
IT freaks me out too. How I can be against God, who does not exist at all? To be for or to be against, one thing is absolutely necessary, the existence of God.</description>

One who knows both avidya and vidya, having overcome death, will know the immortal. This is a very rare couplet. I told you that the Upanishads are not opposed to avidya.</description>

27 November 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL UPANISHIDIC STATEMENT IS AHAM BRAHMASMI. IS IT CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO SACHCHIDANAND?
Anando, the statement in the UPANISHADS, aham brahmasmi, is perhaps the most fundamental and the most essential experience of all the mystics of the world. The UPANISHADS are the only books which are considered not to belong to any religion, yet they are the very essence of religiousness.</description>

Jollity’s the only morality
12 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, and vikrant means power: divine power. And trust not in your won power but in god’s. Man is impotent; only god is potent. If sometimes we feel powerful it is a borrowed power and you should not claim that it is yours; nothing is yours.
To understand this is to become a sannyasin, so from this moment all power is god’s.</description>

‌awakening stops dreaming. But that is not much of a difference ... dreams are just dreams, they are not even as real as soap bubbles.
To allow such people as Ta Hui and his sutras to be holy scripture is a great misunderstanding on the part of people who have followed the path of Zen. Perhaps they have committed the same fallacy as other religions go on committing: if they see something wrong in their scriptures they ignore it, or they try to patch it up, or they try to interpret it in a way that somehow fixes it.</description>

SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR INSTANT ENLIGHTENMENT THESE DAYS AND THERE ARE ALL THESE GURUS RUNNING AROUND SAYING ‘FOLLOW ME’ AND YET IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE ANSWER IS THERE. WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS TO?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND WHY? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ARE DOING AND WHY?
I am not doing anything at all. I am not interested in any goal, in any plan, in any future. I am simply living moment to moment, spontaneously.
Just as the flowers are there in the garden, doing nothing, just being there, or as the stars are in the sky, doing nothing, just being there, I am here.</description>

THE STORY GOES THAT BRAHMAN OBTAINED A VICTORY FOR THE DEVAS. THOUGH THE VICTORY WAS DUE TO BRAHMAN, THE DEVAS BECAME ELATED BY IT AND THOUGHT: “THIS VICTORY IS DUE ONLY TO US; THIS GLORY BELONGS ONLY. TO US”
BRAHMAN CAME TO KNOW THIS, THEIR VANITY. HE VERILY APPEARED BEFORE THEM, BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHO THAT YAKSHA – DEMI-GOD – WAS.</description>

The first question Question 1
OSHO, THE BUDDHA SAID, “IF YOU WANT TO SEE, SEE AT ONCE. DON’T LET THE MIND ENTER INTO IT.” CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT “SEEING”?
Anand Deepesh,
SEEING IS A STATE OF NO-MIND a state of no-thought, a state of pure awareness, when you simply reflect that which is without any interference, any judgment, any like, any dislike; when you don’t say a thing about it, you just function like a mirror.</description>

OSHO, WHAT IS MYSTICISM?
Mysticism is the experience that life is not logic, that life is poetry; that life is not syllogism, that life is a song. Mysticism is the declaration that life can never really be known; it is essentially unknowable.
Science divides existence into two categories: the known and the unknown.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
A MONK ASKED SEPPO, “HOW ABOUT WHEN THE OLD VALLEY WATER IS A COLD SPRING?” SEPPO ANSWERED, “STARE INTO IT AS YOU MAY, YOU CAN’T SEE THE BOTTOM!”
THE MONK SAID, “WHAT ABOUT WHEN WE DRINK THE WATER?” SEPPO SAID, “IT DOESN’T GO IN THE MOUTH.”</description>

Osho gives the name Deva Sura and says that god is the ultimate intoxicant, the ultimate lsd. When people are searching for intoxicants, they are really searching for god. Drink god, and you are drunk forever. Life can be transformed into eternal wine: one can live so utterly drunk that one walks on the earth yet flies in the sky, one lives in the world but the world does not live in one.</description>

Everything else in life is a means; the end is always love. And if the means fulfill love then the person is sane; if the means don’t fulfill love then the person is insane.</description>

Prem Lin. Prem means love; lin means beautiful.
Love is always beautiful. Love cannot be otherwise; if it is, then it is not love. Then something else is hiding behind it; then love is only a facade, a deception, a pretension. If love is really there it is bound to be beautiful. Not only that it is beautiful: whatsoever it touches becomes beautiful, it creates beauty.</description>

Prem means love, diwani means madness – love madness. And that’s the only method to god. If one can be mad in love, then all becomes possible, because only in love are we not tethered to the earth. Suddenly the law of gravitation is replaced by the law of grace. We are not being pulled downwards, we are uplifted; hence the euphoria that love brings.</description>

Deva means divine, varsha means rain – and you have to keep that continuously in your awareness, that god is raining on you. And it is not imagination, it is the truth: god is raining every moment. We live only because he goes on raining; the moment the rain stops, we disappear. It is a subtle energy rain – it is invisible, but life is continuously being given to you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
13 November 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, sandip means a lamp – a divine lamp. The light is already there – it has not to be created; it is inborn, innate. But it has to be discovered. All that is needed is a deep penetration into one’s own being. One has to make an arrow of one’s consciousness so that the arrow can go to the very target of one’s heart, and there is the light of all lights.</description>

Veet Gunther. Veet means going beyond, surpassing, transcending, and gunther means war. Man has been in war continuously. The war has been of two kinds: on the outside with others and on the inside with oneself. The people who have been fighting with others are known as soldiers, and the people who have been fighting with themselves are known as monks.</description>

[A sannyasin says: In the last group, leela, the leader told me that I have a lot of energy in my head and in my sexual centre, but there is no connection between the two. I have another question: I am too identified with my emotions.]
It is true: energy is there and the connection is not there.</description>

13 October 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, mahabodh means great awakening – a great awakening of love. Only love is great – all else is very small. Even the greatest thought of the mind is very small. The mind cannot be great; the mind is basically mean. It is not spacious. The heart is spacious, expansive. The heart can grow so big that it can contain the whole universe.</description>

13 March 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, pratibodha means awareness . . . And become more and more aware of whatsoever you are doing. Just keep one thing in mind continuously: that you have to be aware. Eating, be aware of it; talking, be aware of it; listening, be aware of it. Let awareness become a substratum of each and every activity so each activity becomes just a wave on the deeper substratum of awareness, and that very thing changes the quality of all actions.</description>

Deva means divine, urja means energy – divine energy... and start thinking about yourself more in terms of energy than in terms of body. Matter is just an appearance: it appears solid because we cannot see deeply into it, otherwise it is also liquid. Matter itself is not material; it is tremendous energy revolving with tremendous speed.</description>

Sitaro. It is the root of the word ‘star’, the Sanskrit root. It means the star...
Remember that the real star is within. And the real star is not even a whispering star: it is utterly silent, not even a whisper. And we reach it only when we are totally silent.
Even if a little whispering remains, that is enough of a barrier, that is enough of a wall.</description>

Prem means love and atharva means fire – love fire. And that’s the fire that keeps us alive, and that’s the fire that runs the whole existence. That’s the fire that one has to experience to know what god is.
Physicists say that the existence consists of nothing but electricity, and they are approximately true, because electricity is a form of fire.</description>

Anand means bliss; mario can have two meanings, because it can either be derived from Latin or from Hebrew. In Latin it means god of Mars or god of war; in Hebrew it means rebellion. Choose the Hebrew meaning – god of war is ugly. If one wants to be a god, one should be a god of peace.</description>

Deva means divine, yuuichi means strength – divine strength. Man in himself is impotent. All that is alive in him comes from god, all that is power in him is divine: man is only a vehicle. If one functions simply as a vehicle of god then one’s life is religious. And if one starts interfering in the flow of the energy and is no more just a vehicle but becomes a controller, then one’s life is irreligious.</description>

[Osho gives sannyas to a ten-year-old.]
Gitika means a small song. If life can become just a small song, that is more than enough. That is enough to satisfy all the longing of the heart, that’s enough to fulfil one’s being.
But rarely a person’s life becomes a song. People turn it into a calculation, it becomes more arithmetic than poetry.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY AM I FORCING SITUATIONS ACCORDING TO MY WILL, INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THEM AND LETTING THEM JUST HAPPEN? I HAVE A FEELING THAT MY BODY MAKES ME AWARE OF IT, REACTING WITH HIGH FEVER.

The word upanishad is immensely meaningful. It means sitting by the side of the master, whether he speaks or not. The upanishad can happen in silence. It can happen through words, through gestures, just looking into each other’s eyes.</description>

Gautam the Buddha is one of the most unique expressions of human consciousness. It is difficult to conceive of someone going beyond him, but Mahakashyap, his disciple, really did go beyond him.</description>

From repose to equality. to attain liberation through the golden mean
18 April 1972 pm in Immortal Study Circle
WHO CAN REPOSE IN A MUDDY WORLD? BY LYING STILL IT BECOMES CLEAR.
WHO CAN MAINTAIN HIS CALM FOR LONG? BY ACTIVITY, REST COMES BACK TO LIFE. HE WHO EMBRACES THIS TAO
GUARDS AGAINST BEING OVERFULL.
BECAUSE HE GUARDS AGAINST BEING OVERFULL, HE IS BEYOND WEARING OUT AND RENEWAL.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YESTERDAY YOU TOLD US VERY CLEARLY THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE MASTER’S WORD TO THE LETTER. BUT WE CANNOT CONSULT YOU ON EVERY DETAIL.
HOW CAN WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATH WHEN THE MIND IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE EASY WAY?
The real problem is not consulting the master, but how to be more meditative, because the physical part of the master is not the significant thing.</description>

LSD can be used as a help, but the help is very dangerous; it is not so easy. If you use a mantra, even that can become difficult to throw, but if you use acid, LSD it will be even more difficult to throw.
The moment you are on an LSD trip you are not in control.</description>

Deva means divine, manglam means blessing... and that’s how I look at life – it is a divine blessing. Many people think so negatively about life that it almost looks like a curse. And there are philosophies that think that life is an accident... meaningless. If one starts looking that way, life becomes that way, because your outlook is going to become your reality.</description>

‌If meditation is deep, if awareness is clear, nothing can disturb it. Then everything is ephemeral. Amrapali became one of the enlightened women among Buddha&#39;s disciples.
So the whole question is: wherever you are, become more centered, become more alert, live more consciously. There is nowhere else to go. Everything that has to happen, has to happen within you, and it is in your hands.</description>

Avoda means service out of ecstasy. The Christian idea of service is that service has to be first then ecstasy follows. The Eastern idea is just the reverse: ecstasy has to come first then service follows. If service comes first it will be just a duty – imposed, cultivated, practised; it is impossible for ecstasy to arise out of it.</description>

OSHO, LAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT ONE CAN GROW THROUGH TOTAL ACCEPTANCE. BUT THE EAST HAS REMAINED UNDEVELOPED DUE TO THIS PRINCIPLE OF ACCEPTANCE AND CONTENTMENT, WHEREAS THE WEST HAS BECOME MORE DEVELOPED ONLY BECAUSE OF NON-ACCEPTANCE AND DISCONTENTMENT.
THEREFORE, ISN’T IT OBVIOUS THAT DISCONTENTMENT AND NON-ACCEPTANCE IS THE PRINCIPLE FOR EVOLUTION AND GROWTH AND NOT TOTAL ACCEPTANCE?</description>

ARE YOU TRYING TO DESTROY ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS IDEAS ABOUT RELIGION?
There is no other way to be religious. All that you have heard about religion, read about religion, has to be totally dropped. Unless you are clean, with no writing on your consciousness, you will never know what religion is.</description>

THESE FOUR (TRUTH, KNOWLEDGE, INFINITY AND BLISS) ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS, AND THAT WHICH IS CHANGELESS, IN SPITE OF SYMBOLIC OBJECTS LIKE SPACE, TIME, ET CETERA, IS CALLED TAT OR THAT, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF PARAMATMA OR THE SUPREME SELF.

IS IT TRUE THAT A REBEL IS BORN AND NOT MADE?
OR ARE WE BORN REBELS BUT TAMED AND CONDITIONED BY OUR SOCIETIES?

YESTERDAY, THE WHOLE DAY I SAW MANY SANNYASINS GIVE SYMPATHY TO SWAMI PREM ANAM AFTER YOUR DISCOURSE. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
Sympathy is not compassion; it is just the opposite. Sympathy is a kind of exploitation of the other person. When you sympathize with somebody, you are higher, better, and the other is lower, falling, degraded.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
HOW CAN WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOUL EXISTS AFTER DEATH AND TRANSMIGRATES TO ANOTHER FORM OF LIFE, OR DISSOLVES INTO THE UNIVERSE?
I have never asked you to believe in anything.
It is my experience that the soul exists after death, that it transmigrates into other forms of life, and finally when there is no more to learn, no question to be answered, no search, no desire – when that ultimate point of absolute contentment, fulfillment, enlightenment arises – then the soul simply dissolves into existence.</description>

WHAT IS A BUDDHAFIELD? JUST LIVING TOGETHER, RUNNING BUSINESSES, DOESN’T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IT IS NOT SATISFYING. IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING DEEPER – SOMETHING MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE COLLECTIVE AND THE INDIVIDUAL, IN WHICH BOTH GROW – IS NEEDED.</description>

Where the positive and negative meet
8 September 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE TAO, THE UNDIVIDED, GREAT ONE, GIVES RISE TO TWO OPPOSITE REALITY PRINCIPLES, THE DARK AND THE LIGHT, YIN AND YANG. FROM YIN COMES THE RECEPTIVE FEMININE PRINCIPLE; FROM YANG COMES THE CREATIVE MASCULINE PRINCIPLE; FROM YIN COMES MING, LIFE; FROM YANG, HSING OR HUMAN NATURE.
EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTAINS A CENTRAL MONAD, WHICH, AT THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION, SPLITS INTO LIFE AND HUMAN NATURE, MING AND HSING.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THESE LAST DAYS, I HAVE COME FROM DISCOURSE SHAKING AND QUIVERING FROM INSIDE OUT. IT COMES AFTER YOU HAVE LEFT. ALTHOUGH MY BODY TREMBLES, IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE FEAR... OR NOT ANY FEAR THAT I HAVE KNOWN BEFORE. THE IMAGE THAT COMES IS OF ME HANGING BY MY FINGERTIPS TO A WINDOW FRAME HIGH IN THE SKY, WITH NOTHING BENEATH IT.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
HYAKUJO NEEDED TO SELECT A MONK TO BE THE MASTER OF A NEW MONASTERY THAT WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED ON THE MOUNTAIN OF TA-KUEI-SHAN.
HE CALLED THE COOK OF HIS MONASTERY AND TOLD HIM HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN.
BUT THE CHIEF MONK OVERHEARD HYAKUJO’S CONVERSATION WITH THE COOK AND SAID, “NO ONE CAN SAY THAT THE COOK MONK IS BETTER THAN THE CHIEF MONK.</description>

[A sannyasin says: We don’t have any children yet and I have some feeling to have a child. I’m thirty-two now and I feel ready, but I would like your advice.
Osho checks her energy.]
Just one thing. You can become a mother, but whenever you make love, always make love after meditation. Make it a point that you meditate, and only when the energy is very meditative, only then make love.</description>

29 January 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Satsang is a very significant word – it means the presence of the master. It cannot be translated into English because there has never been such a thing as satsang in English.
In India, in the whole of the East, this is the most precious thing – just to be in the presence of the master; not doing anything, just being there.</description>

Don’t be worried about the neutrality and don’t think that it is something that should not be. We have become accustomed to ups and downs, so both are okay: when we are up we feel good, when we are down we feel bad.</description>

Constantly remember it. By remembering something constantly, it creates a milieu around you. And as I see it, if one can attain to love, one has attained.</description>

Deva Margaret. Deva means divine; margaret means a pearl – a divine pearl.
Man is oblivious of his own treasures because he never looks within; his eyes are focused on the outside. He goes on searching everywhere except into his own self. The search is bound to be futile because the treasure is within; it is not without.</description>

God is not a person but another name for the totality of all. To live as a part against the whole is to live in misery. To live as a part with the whole, as the whole, in the whole, is to be in bliss.</description>

14 August 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss and sujan means awareness. This has to be remembered – that awareness is good only when it is suffused with blissfulness. If it is dry it will enhance the ego; if it is dry, with no joy in it, it will not lead you towards the divine; it will make you more and more self-centred.</description>

Prem Francesco. Prem means love; francesco means freedom. Love is the ultimate form of freedom; if love cannot bring freedom then nothing else can. If even love becomes a bondage then everything else is going to become a bondage. Love is the only hope of salvation.
It is through love that we become able to see something of the beyond.</description>

Veet means beyond, santap means anguish – beyond anguish. Anguish is one of the most fundamental problems of the human mind. Man exists in anguish, man is anguish, a constant anxiety, a constant feeling of falling apart, a constant fear of being torn. No other animal in existence lives in such anguish. All other animals are at peace with themselves, except for man.</description>

Deva means divine, iman means faith. Man can either live in belief or in faith. Belief is man-made: faith is a grace that comes from beyond. Belief is a thing of the mind: faith, a stirring in the heart. Belief is superficial, it never transforms anybody. Rather than transforming it only consoles. It is convenient to be a Hindu, to be a Christian, to be a Mohammedan, because the crowd is there, surrounding you in every way.</description>

THERE IS NO WAY TO SEEK TRUTH because truth is not far away. Truth is not “there” somewhere so that you have to go to it, so that you have to reach to it; truth is not to be sought because truth is the very being of the seeker.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
DO MIRACLES REALLY NOT EXIST?
I am sorry to disappoint you, but I can’t help it.
I cannot give you the consolation that has been given by all the religions down the centuries. I cannot do it because that consolation has cost too much.</description>

“EASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. CONTINUE EASY, AND YOU ARE RIGHT.
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY.”

OSHO, YOU SAID LAST NIGHT THAT TO REALIZE THE THAT, THE TRANSCENDENTAL TRUTH EVERYWHERE, ONE MUST FIRST REALIZE IT AT ONE’S OWN CENTER OF BEING. THEN YOU SAID THAT A CENTERING FOR THIS IS NEEDED. IS THIS CENTERING THE SAME AS THAT OF GURDJIEFF’S CRYSTALLIZATION?
PLEASE TELL US HOW THIS CENTERING OR CRYSTALLIZATION IS DIFFERENT FROM STRENGTHENING ONE’S OWN EGO, AND HOW DOES IT LEAD TO THE TRANSCENDENTAL TRUTH, THE THAT?</description>

14 January 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, and achinta means no anxiety. And remember that only love brings a state of no anxiety – and only love. Everything else creates a new anxiety.
You can go on changing your anxieties – somebody is seeking money, somebody is seeking power, then somebody starts seeking god – but all things will bring anxiety.</description>

12 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO YOU SPOKE TO US OF THREE CATEGORIES OF BELIEF: THEIST, ATHEIST, AND AGNOSTIC. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT GNOSTIC?
I do not consider ‘gnostic’ a category of belief. The theist believes in God, without knowing, without any experience. His belief is just an escape from doubt.</description>

The first question Question 1
WHAT IS A MYSTIC?
I don’t know, Purna, and nobody else knows either. That’s why a mystic is called a mystic. Something indefinable, something very elusive, something that cannot be grasped, that cannot be comprehended. Not that it is something special – it is very ordinary. That makes the mystery ten thousandfold.</description>

Intuition: A Non-Explanation
QUESTION: CAN INTUITION BE EXPLAINED SCIENTIFICALLY? IS IT A PHENOMENON OF THE MIND?
Intuition cannot be explained scientifically because the very phenomenon is unscientific and irrational. The very phenomenon of intuition is irrational. In language it looks okay to ask, “Can intuition be explained?” It means: can intuition be reduced to intellect? But intuition means something beyond the intellect, something not of the intellect, something coming from someplace where intellect is totally unaware.</description>

SOME YOUNG PEOPLE IN GERMANY OFTEN USE THIS MOTTO: “GOD DOES NOT EXIST, BUT STILL I HATE HIM.”

The experience of hate is not very far away from love. It is love standing on its head.

Question 1
THE WORD ‘ESOTERIC’ HAS BEEN USED IN A VERY SACRED SENSE. WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL US WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO USE IT IN A RIDICULOUS AND HUMOROUS SENSE?
The question is from Yoga Chinmaya.
The word ‘esoteric’ means the hidden – it is ridiculous because nothing is hidden. All is obvious, God is obvious; if you cannot see, it is not because God is hidden, but because you are keeping your eyes closed.</description>

Spiritual pregnancy
28 November 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
OFTEN THESE DAYS I FEEL AS IF I AM PREGNANT. IT IS NOT A DOWN-PULLING BURDEN. IT RATHER FEELS LIKE A WEIGHTLESS, BUT EXPANSIVE SOMETHING IN MY BELLY AND MY CHEST. IT IS A VERY STRANGE SENSATION FOR A MAN. I AM NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF PREGNANCY YET – MY BELLY IS STILL FLAT AS USUAL BUT NOW I HAVE EXPOSED MYSELF, AND THERE IS NO HOLY GHOST TO BLAME AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE VIRGIN MARY.</description>

Question
PEOPLE IN BOTH THE EAST AND THE WEST ARE SUFFERING IN EVERY DIMENSION OF LIFE. WILL YOU DIAGNOSE THIS SUFFERING FOR US: ITS CAUSES, ITS PREVENTIONS AND ITS CURES?
Suffering is symbolic. It does not have causes, but only one cause. Howsoever different the suffering, the cause is always the same. The cause is that the hidden harmony between the human mind and the cosmic existence is lost.</description>

The best government is no government
14 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE BEST GOVERNMENT?
No government.
The very idea of somebody governing somebody else is inhuman. Government is a game, the ugliest and the dirtiest game in the world.
But there are people in the lowest state of consciousness who enjoy it: these are the politicians.</description>

24 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO: ARE KRISHNA, MAHAVIRA, BUDDHA AND LAO TZU ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POVERTY IN THE WORLD, JUST AS JESUS CHRIST IS? I MYSELF WANT TO SERVE THE POOR AND THE DOWNTRODDEN. CAN I DO IT WITH YOUR BLESSINGS?
Sangam Lal Pandey
YES, THESE PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE for the poverty in the world.</description>

I WOULD LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE, BUT I AM AFRAID OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND SO AFRAID OF LOVE, AND I DON’T KNOW WHY.
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR ME TO FALL IN LOVE?

It will be good for you also. This is my observation, that there are many things that you learn only when you start teaching them. The best way to learn a thing is to teach it.
And you grow more when you are less concerned about your own growth and more concerned with others’ growth, their problems.</description>

Aseem means the unbounded, the infinite. Start living in the infinite, because that is our true reality. The idea that we are finite is just an idea, it does not correspond to reality; hence it creates much misery. Once you start thinking of yourself as finite you are constantly in struggle with the infinite.</description>

Deva Werner. Deva means divine; werner means a friend.
Friendship is one of the most significant qualities, particularly for a seeker of truth, because truth can be known only if you befriend existence. If you antagonize existence, existence will not allow you its innermost secrets. You have to befriend nature, both without and within; you have to be in a loving relationship with all that is.</description>

Deva means god or godliness; saguna means with qualities, with form. God can be conceived of in two ways: with qualities or without qualities, with form or without form. The centre of existence is formless but the circumference is full of form. The world is the form of god and god is the formlessness of the world.</description>

Satyam Janis. Satyam means deep truth – the ultimate truth: and Janis means grace. Truth brings grace; untruth is disgrace.
And people live in untruth, people live in lies. The society supports lies; the state strengthens lies, the church. Nobody is for truth, because truth is dangerous, because truth is rebellious, because truth cannot be enslaved, because truth cannot be exploited, because truth makes a person so utterly unique that the crowd is afraid of it.</description>

Osho advises her to leave him unless she wants to be a babysitter for the rest of her life! He says that a relationship should only be out of love and for no other reason.</description>

17 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Veet means beyond, dhamma means religion. I teach a religion which is beyond religions. I teach a religion which is religionless, because religions – Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism – have not helped. They have, on the contrary, been very great disasters to humanity. Now something is urgently needed which will not have any adjective to it, just pure religion.</description>

4 September 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine and shubha means goodness – divine goodness. Human beings are good, but their goodness is also part of their policy. They say that honesty is the best policy. Even through goodness they want to earn something. It is a bargain. To be good is beneficial, hence they are good. Their goodness is not unconditional; it is conditional.</description>

Anand Elles. Anand means bliss; elles comes from the Hebrew root el; el means God. Bliss is God.
God is indefinable, but if any definition is possible at all, then bliss is his definition. The definition that comes closest to define God is bliss. Even that falls short but it is the most approximate.</description>

Anand means bliss, nijo means individuality. Individuality is your essential core. Individuality is not your personality. Personality is given to you by the family, the society, culture; individuality is that which you bring into the world – that is your original face. The individuality gets lost in many layers of personality, and a man has many personalities.</description>

Deva Allene. Deva means divine, allene means harmony – divine harmony. The only secret worth learning in life is the secret of being in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the existence itself. Ordinarily people are constantly in conflict; they are in conflict with existence, with others, and with themselves. This triple conflict is their whole life.</description>

Anand means bliss, guha means secret – the secret bliss. Happiness can be shared, it is always in sharing; bliss cannot be shared, it is utterly private. Happiness happens in a relationship, in love. When you are feeling in tune with somebody there is happiness. When you feel in tune with yourself there is bliss; it happens in utter aloneness.</description>

Prem Maitri means love, friendship, and friendship has a higher quality than love. The next step of love is friendship. Not that it is lower, as it is understood ordinarily; it is not.
In love there is passion, lust; love is more rooted in the physical. Friendship is purer, not rooted in the sexual at all.</description>

The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU REALLY LOVE SOMENDRA STILL?
Manu,
MY LOVE is not conditional. Love cannot be conditional – either it is or it is not. It is not caused by anything, hence nothing can disturb it. But you know something else in the name of love: you know only infatuation, attraction, lust. Your love is nothing but a subtle strategy to exploit the other, hence it is bound to disappear sooner or later – and you will find enough reasons why it disappears.</description>

If the ego is there, whatsoever you do is an ego-trip. Demanding that people not give you importance is ego-tripping as much as demanding that they do]</description>

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AWARENESS AND WITNESSING?
There is much difference between awareness and witnessing. Witnessing is still an act; you are doing it, the ego is there. So the phenomenon of witnessing is divided between the subject and the object.
Witnessing is a relationship between subject and object. Awareness is absolutely devoid of any subjectivity or objectivity.</description>

6 May 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
CHOKEI ONE DAY SAID, “EVEN IF YOU SAY THAT THE ARHATS STILL HAVE THREE POISONS, YOU SHOULD NOT SAY THAT THE TATHAGATA HAS TWO LANGUAGES. I DO NOT SAY THAT THE TATHAGATA HAS NO LANGUAGE BUT THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE TWO LANGUAGES.”

Question 1 OSHO,
YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AGAINST SOCIALISM, AND YET I FEEL THAT IN THIS COMMUNE THE FIRST EXPERIMENT OF AN ALIVE SOCIALISM IS HAPPENING. IS THIS ANOTHER OF YOUR CONTRADICTIONS?

Anand means bliss, ramraj means the kingdom of god: bliss, the kingdom of god. It is within you. The sky that I was talking about just now is within you. And the eagle I was telling you to become is your very soul. The soul is really confined, very much confined because the body is very earthbound.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS THE WORLD IN SO MUCH MISERY? WHY CAN’T WE ALL BE JUST AS BLISSFUL AS YOU ALWAYS ARE?
THE child is the father of the man, and down the centuries we have been destroying the child. And once the child is destroyed, the whole life becomes unnatural, miserable, meaningless.</description>

I FEEL LOST IN YOU WITHOUT REASON OR DIRECTION. QUESTIONS AND DESIRES FALL IN CONFUSION BEFORE YOU. OVERPOWERED BY SENSELESS FAITH AND LOVE, LISTLESSLY I WAIT, FEELING LIKE A FOOL. ARE THERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BLIND FAITH, LOVE AND SURRENDER?

The first question Question 1
OSHO, HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT I FEEL SO AT HOME AND SO LOST IN THIS BUDDHAFIELD?
Deva Kamma,
THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION IN IT; it is as it should be. To be lost, utterly lost, is to be at home. Man ordinarily lives as an ego, separate from the whole, like an island, with a definite identity – the name, the form; he is somebody.</description>

‌Truth is simple, obvious, uncomplicated. All that it needs is just a silent awareness, and a great understanding descends on you, an understanding that does not become knowledge, an understanding that deepens your innocence and that deepens the mystery of life.

I SEE THE BEGINNING WITH YOU, BUT NOT THE END. PLEASE COMMENT.
There is no end to this pilgrimage, there is only the beginning. It is a very profound question.

Nothing is happening to Vimalkirti – exactly nothing, because nothing is nirvana. The West has no idea of the beauty of nothingness. The whole Western attitude is extrovert, oriented towards things, oriented towards actions. ‘Nothing’ sound like emptiness – it is not so.</description>

31 March 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[To a sannyasin who had said he was studying history in the West, but didn’t like it.]
History is not good...(laughter) it is just useless. Read something else, study something else which can be of creative use for your future.
Ninety-nine percent of history concerns foolish politicians. It is better not to know it, because it gives you a wrong notion about human beings.</description>

16 February 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss and megha means path...
Man has to become a path of bliss. Bliss comes from the unknown, from the blue. Just as the sun- rays come from far away, so does bliss; from the centre of the universe, bliss radiates. But we are closed to it; we don’t allow the way, we don’t open the door.</description>

How many books have I talked about in the P.P.S? Hmmm? “Forty, Osho.”
Forty?
“Yes, Osho.”
I am a stubborn man you know. I am going to end it at fifty whatsoever happens; otherwise I will start another P.P.P.S. My stubbornness has really repaid me: it has helped me to fight all kinds of nonsense that the world is full of.</description>

Feel unconditionally compassionate. And give as much as you can give of your love. Share your life as much as you can share.</description>

Swanirodha. Swa means self, ego, nirodha means cessation – cessation of the self. And the only problem is the self; all other problems are by-products of it. People go on becoming too concerned about other problems. They try to solve them, but they cannot be solved because they are not the real problems... just by-products, shadows.</description>

Prem Lyn. Prem means love; lyn comes from a German word “lindy”; lindy means serpent. It is a symbol of wisdom. The serpent power is our intrinsic power. It is called serpent power because it is coiled up like a serpent at the root of our being. It can uncoil, and the uncoiling of it is the real growth.</description>

And the fire has to be a total fire; one has to burn at the optimum. Just a little holding back and one misses.</description>

Prem madhi. It means love mind. The mind has two aspects: one aspect which thinks, another aspect which feels. And the reality is known not by the thinking aspect but by the feeling aspect.
The joy of life is also attained through the feeling aspect. If a person becomes addicted too much to the thinking aspect he becomes dry.</description>

There are six great religions in the world. They can be divided into two categories: one consists of Judaism, Christianity and Islam; they believe in only one life. You are just between birth and death. There is nothing beyond birth and death – life is all. Although they believe in heaven and hell and God, they are the earnings from one life, a single life.</description>

And that’s my message, the whole message.
The man without bliss is without any soul. He is just a mechanism; the soul is not yet born. He is functioning just as any other machine can function, and he may be functioning very efficiently, but efficiency does not prove the existence of the soul.</description>

And love is the ultimate need. Everything else is secondary. Everything else is just a means to that great end. If love happens then all has happened; if love does not happen then nothing has happened, the whole of life has just been a wasteland.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
16 October 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, giri means mountain – a divine mountain. It is a metaphor for absolute meditation. When one is utterly silent, still, and there is no movement in the mind, one starts feeling like a great peak of the mountain... snow-capped.
The mountain has always attracted meditators. There is something in the mountains – the silence, the stillness, the absolute unmoving.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
17 March 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Shunya means the ultimate experience of nothingness, of non-being, of no-self, and jiten means conqueror – conqueror of the no-self. It is very paradoxical but life is paradoxical, truth is paradoxical. If truth is not paradoxical you can be certain that it cannot be truth.
Life exists only through death; that is the paradox.</description>

17 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Sangit, means music; and music is something that is the most spiritual, religious, and the most expressive of the existence of god. Where words fail, music succeeds. Words can only describe god: they go round and round. Music can represent; it is very symbolic.
So become more and more musical in your being. Life has to be treated as a musical instrument.</description>

Prem means love, anada means soundlessness – loving soundlessness. And that is a map for your inner journey: become as soundless as possible. The inner chattering has to be completely dropped. The mind goes on creating sound, continuously – day in, day out; whether awake or asleep, the mind goes on creating more and more sounds, more words.</description>

Prem means love, carina has two meanings; one is a star, a star of the constellation Orion–a love star.
Love is always a possibility, always a potential, and the potential is such that it cannot be actualised absolutely; it is inexhaustible. So it is always a far-away distant star; you are always arriving closer and closer, but you can never say ‘I have arrived.</description>

Deva means divine, robbie means bright, shining one. God is the shining one. He shines through everything – through the flowers and through the stars and through the eyes of people. That which shines is divine, and the person is blind who cannot see it. Not to see god is the greatest calamity that can happen to a person, and that has happened to millions of people: people have become utterly incapable of seeing god.</description>

Baula,
ZEN IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY AT ALL. To approach Zen as if it were a philosophy is to start in a wrong way from the very beginning. A philosophy is something of the mind; Zen is totally beyond the mind.</description>

In the Lake of the Void
26 August 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT FURTHER ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C. G. JUNG’S ‘PROCESS OF INDIVIDUATION’ AND THE ESSENCE OF THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER?
Habib, Carl Gustav Jung was groping in the right direction but he had not yet arrived. It was not his own experience, it was a philosophy.</description>

It is Already the Best
26 October 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I AM FEELING HELPLESS. I DON’T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO ANY MORE. IT IS AS IF EVERYTHING I DO WON’T CHANGE THIS, IT ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE. BUT ALSO DOING NOTHING DOES NOT MAKE THINGS BETTER. YOU SAY THAT EMPTINESS IS BLISS. FOR ME IT SEEMS TO BE DULL AND BORING; IT IS LIKE BEING DEAD.</description>

Let’s not face it – you’re absolutely alone
15 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
IS THE HYPOTHESIS OF GOD NOT USEFUL IN ANY WAY? – BECAUSE THE VERY IDEA OF DROPPING THE IDEA OF GOD MAKES ME IMMENSELY AFRAID.
IT is already too late. The moment one starts calling the idea of God a hypothesis, the idea of God is already dropped.</description>

5 February 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS READY TO PREACH – NO MATTER TO WHOM, NO MATTER ABOUT WHAT, AND NO MATTER WHETHER ANYBODY RECEIVES IT OR NOT?
Man is very much afraid of being ignorant. The reality is that he is ignorant. Now there are only two ways to get out of it.</description>

Live is on the razor’s edge
8 June 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I FIND MYSELF BEING DEEPLY TOUCHED BY YOUR VISION OF THE REBEL. I ALWAYS PRIDED MYSELF IN BEING A NONCONFORMIST. LAST NIGHT IN A DREAM I SAW MYSELF BEING PERSECUTED FOR LIVING REBELLIOUSLY AND I BECAME AFRAID. WAKING UP, I REALIZED THAT WHAT I USED TO THINK OF AS REBELLION WAS ACTUALLY A SAFE GAME FOR ME, WELL WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS.</description>

No ‘I’ can see god
16 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Visarjan means dissolution, dissolution into the divine, immersion in the divine, the state of being lost.…
One has to learn how to disperse oneself, how to come to a point where one is not. Only then god is. You and god cannot exist together; that’s not possible. That’s why so many people go on missing god – because they are asking for the impossible: they want to remain themselves and they want to see god.</description>

2 February 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
TO THE WESTERN WORLD THE TERMS “FREEDOM” AND “THE MASTER” ARE VIRTUALLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE; FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MET YOU THIS IS WILDLY INACCURATE. HOW DO YOU REDEFINE “FREEDOM” AND “THE MASTER” FOR THE WESTERN UNDERSTANDING?
Vadan and Iti, the Western world has not come in contact with the tremendous reality that happens in the meeting of a master and a disciple.</description>

MAN IS DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER, MOST OF ALL TO HIMSELF; THE SPIRIT OFTEN TELLS LIES ABOUT THE SOUL.…
BUT HE HAS DISCOVERED HIMSELF WHO SAYS:THIS IS MY GOOD AND EVIL: HE HAS SILENCED THEREBY THE MOLE AND DWARF WHO SAYS: ‘GOOD FOR ALL, EVIL FOR ALL.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
OF VOLUNTARY DEATH
MANY DIE TOO LATE AND SOME DIE TOO EARLY. STILL THE DOCTRINE SOUNDS STRANGE: ‘DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME.’
DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME: THUS ZARATHUSTRA TEACHES.

Only The Knowing Remain
In Mt. Abu, Rajasthan, India
THE FACE OF THAT BRAHMAN,
SITTING IN THE MIDST OF ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT, IS COVERED WITH A GOLDEN CURTAIN.
O LORD, REMOVE THAT CURTAIN SO THAT I, A SEEKER OF TRUTH, MAY ATTAIN TO THE SUPREME.
This sutra is rather difficult to understand, but it is of extraordinary significance for many reasons. First of all, we generally believe that if truth is covered, it must be covered by darkness, but the sutra says it is covered by light; hence the prayer that God will remove the curtain of light.</description>

15 December 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RECOGNITION? WHY DO WE TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED? WHY WILL WE, YOUR DISCIPLES, NOT RECOGNIZE YOU UNTIL YOUR CRUCIFIXION? WHEN YOU SAID THAT, IT WAS LIKE A SWORD THROUGH ME.
Sudha, the recognition of a master depends on your becoming more conscious, more aware, more alert.</description>

THE idea of the new man is not only not similar to the idea of the superman, it is just the very opposite.

‌CHAPTER 16
There are not golden rules
18 June 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho tells a sannyasin there are some things about his energy that it will be helpful for him to know. You haven’t allowed yourself to ever be wild, you’ve always had a subtle control inside you – and that can be a hindrance to spiritual growth... ]
There is a subtle difference between repression and control.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHEN NONSANNYASINS THAT I KNOW ARE NOT DRAWN TO SANNYAS AND DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU, I FIND MYSELF FEELING VERY ANGRY, HURT, AND FRUSTRATED ABOUT IT. CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS REACTION OF MINE?
This has been the tragedy of the whole human history. People want to convert other people to their idea, their ideology, without realizing that this is against the freedom of the individual.</description>

OSHO: THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT SEX FOR REPRODUCTION IS SINFUL. I HAVE ALSO READ YOUR WORDS SAYING THAT THE GREATEST CREATIVE ACT OF A WOMAN IS IN PRODUCING A CHILD, AND THAT THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A WOMAN.
IF THIS IS SO, THEN IS THERE SIN IN PARTICIPATING IN SEX AND IN LOVE IN THE HOPE OF CREATING A CHILD AND EXPERIENCING THE JOY OF CREATION AND THE RENEWING ENERGY OF THE UNIVERSE?</description>

There is no goal of life, for the simple reason that life is its own goal. The goal is intrinsic, not something outside; not there, far away, but herenow, in this very moment.</description>

Deva means god, nirguno means unconditional, formless, attributeless, qualityless. God can be conceived of either in the form or in the formless, either as the world, the manifested, or as the seed, the unmanifested. The form arises out of no-form and falls back into the formless again. Everything comes out of nothing and goes back to nothing, so nothing is not against existence; it is the very source of it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 17
20 June 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva Pritama. Deva means God; Pritama means beloved – God’s beloved. Yes, to be a sannyasin is to become a beloved of God.
Sannyas is not anything less than a love affair – more, certainly it is, but not less. It is mad, mad, mad love... and a madness that is absolutely incomprehensible, a madness that is not a pathology but the ultimate in health, in sanity, in being whole.</description>

Deva means divine; Matina is a sufi name for God. It means ‘firmness, rootedness.’ The full name will mean: divine firmness, divine rootedness. And that is what is needed. Man has become uprooted, he is living without roots; that’s his problem. He has lost all roots. He does not know from where he comes, why he exists, where he is going.</description>

Mm mm, something has broken inside and you should be happy about it. Some ice has broken, some coldness has broken, some dead layer has broken. Whenever it happens, one starts crying because one again becomes a child.</description>

Ordinarily it means a person who tries to subdue his ego, who tries to control his egoistic mind, who tries never to assert himself – a non-assertive person.</description>

Prem means love, vatayana means now, the present moment – love now. And my whole emphasis is on this moment, because this moment contains all. Now is the only reality – all else is either memory or imagination. And even for the past to exist as memory, now is needed. It doesn’t exist as the past; it exists as a thought in the present.</description>

Jivan means life, harito means green – green life, fresh life, young life. and always remember that life is green, theories are grey. Avoid the theories and plunge into life. Theories are suicidal, poisonous; they destroy. Life is divine, life is eternity.
To get in tune with life is to enter into god, and to remain confined to the theories is to remain in the prison of the mind.</description>

[A visitor who had done the Tathata group said he found it easy. Osho suggested he do the Enlightenment Intensive, saying that that would be more intense.]

Deva Constantinos. Deva means God; constantinos means constant. Only God is a constant factor in existence; everything else is always changing, moving. Everything else is a process; only God is a being. God is the very center of all this movement, and the center cannot move, only the wheel moves.

Baba has three meanings. One is: the small child, the innocent child, the child who cannot yet speak, because the moment a child starts speaking he is no more a child; he has become part of civilisation. Language is the world of civilisation; it is language that makes man different from animals. If language disappears then man will be just as one of the animals; there will be no distinction.</description>

Kadamba is the other tree which is very symbolic, because krishna used to dance under a kadamba tree.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE WITH YOU AND LISTENING TO YOU SO CLOSELY, I SEE MY BODY – AND THE FEELINGS I HAVE TOWARDS IT – CHANGING A LOT. THE WAY I WALK, THE WAY I LOOK AT MYSELF WHEN TAKING A SHOWER, THE WAY I FEEL IN MY BODY – EVERYTHING SEEMS SO DIFFERENT TO ME THAT I CAN ONLY RECOGNIZE IT WITH AN ASTONISHED FACE.</description>

15 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MADNESS AND ENLIGHTENMENT?
THERE is a great difference and also a great similarity. The similarity has to be understood first, because without understanding it, it will be difficult to understand the difference.
Both are beyond the mind – madness and enlightenment. Madness is below the mind.</description>

I am introducing you to a new meditation. It is divided in three parts.
The first part is gibberish. The word ‘gibberish’ comes from a Sufi mystic, Jabbar. Jabbar never spoke any language, he just uttered nonsense. Still he had thousands of disciples because what he was saying was, “Your mind is nothing but gibberish.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT?
Milarepa, there is no language of enlightenment. There cannot be by the very nature of the phenomenon. Enlightenment happens beyond mind and language is part of the mind. Enlightenment is experienced in utter silence.
If you want to call silence a language, then of course enlightenment has a language which consists of silence, which consists of blissfulness, which consists of ecstasy, which consists of innocence.</description>

There are no holy books. All books are human, but each religion has been deceiving people that their book is the only holy book. And by saying, “This is the only holy book,” they are saying that it is written by God.</description>

Prem means love, anado means silence – soundless silence. Love is silence – it is the music of silence. That’s why love cannot be expressed. And the moment you express it, you falsify it. It is no more the same experience that was felt in the heart. The moment it comes into the words it is already far away from the heart, because no word can enter the heart and the heart cannot enter into any word at all they never meet.</description>

[A sannyasin said he needed to return home as he was unwell. He was apprehensive about going, and felt he would miss Osho’s physical presence. He was also afraid that he would fall back into his old patterns again.]
No, no. I will not allow that, don’t be worried. That is my responsibility, mm?</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
18 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Sindhu means ocean. Love can only be oceanic; it cannot be small. It cannot be small because it cannot be a closed phenomenon. It is an open, wide sky. Love knows no limitations.
Love is not attachment. Love is not possessiveness. When love becomes possessive and love becomes attachment it is no more love; it is simply a corpse.</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
18 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Jaya means victory, dip means light – light of victory. And it is not the victory that comes from the outside, because that victory brings only darkness and nothing else. The victory that brings light comes from within. It is not conquering the other, it is conquering oneself. And I use the expression ‘conquering oneself’ very hesitatingly because in fact it is not a conquering at all: there is nobody to be conquered, there are not two persons inside.</description>

21 June 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Love is not something which we can create; it is something given. It is inbuilt in our very being. It is not something that we produce later on; it comes with our birth, it is a natural energy. We may deny it expression; then it becomes a repressed force. It can turn sour, bitter, poisonous, if it is repressed.</description>

[Wasi – a sufi name of god]
It literally means: the all-comprehending one, the all-knowing one, one who understands all. Deva Wasi will mean: divine knowing, divine comprehension.
There is a human way to know; that is intellectual – it is like groping in darkness. There is a divine way to know; that is intuitive – it is not groping in the dark.</description>

The inner growth is not something that you can do anything about. At the most you can stop obstructing it, that’s all. Positively, nothing can be done. But if you stop hindering it, it goes on its own accord.

It is fulfilling others’ expectations about you. It is not growth, because it has not arisen out of your own spontaneity.

WE HAVE DROPPED THE WORD “WORK” BECAUSE OF ITS UGLY CONNOTATIONS. PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORD “WORSHIP” AND ITS CONNOTATIONS.
Work is something that you have to do. It is imposed on you by your social circumstances, financial status, political structure. But worship is that which you love to do.</description>

YOU WOULD KNOW THE SECRET OF DEATH.
BUT HOW SHALL YOU FIND IT UNLESS YOU SEEK IT IN THE HEART OF LIFE?

Deva means divine, god, and arpitam means surrendered to – surrendered to god. And the meaning of surrender is not that you surrender your self – you surrender only your ego. The self cannot be surrendered – only the ego, the false entity that appears to be you, has to be surrendered.</description>

Anand means bliss, mahamani means the cosmic mind – bliss mind. And all depends on the mind. Ultimately all is our attitude. If we suffer, we suffer because of our wrong attitude, because of our wrong mind. Because we have created a mind which suffers, because we have cultivated a suffering mind, we suffer.</description>

Prem sandesh means message of love... and when you are really in the right space, you become the message of love. Your whole being flowers like love. Your whole life is nothing but love energy then, and whatsoever you touch becomes gold.
With hate, whatsoever you touch becomes poison – hate is a poisoning element.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT?
THE most significant thing about enlightenment is that it is the most insignificant thing in the world.
The scriptures are full of great attributes, qualities, about enlightenment. It is the highest peak human consciousness has ever achieved.</description>

Question 1
TECHNIQUES ARE SHORTCUTS, REVOLUTIONS, BUT ARE NOT THESE AGAINST TAO, SWABHAV, THE NATURE?
They are. They are against tao, they are against swabhav. Any effort is against shabhav, tao; effort as such is against tao. If you can leave everything to swabhav, tao, nature, then no technique is needed, because that is the ultimate technique.</description>

WHY DON’T YOU ADDRESS YOUR AUDIENCE?
There is a certain basic foundation for it: there is no audience to be addressed. As far as I am concerned, we are not separate. To you, I am separate from you; hence the question. But to me, you are just part of a vast continent of consciousness – in the same way that I am part of it.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
PLEASE MAKE ME UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LIVE “RIGHTLY.”
There are two ways to live, to be, to know: one is of effort, will, ego; the other is of no effort, no struggle, but being in a let-go with existence.
All the religions of the world have been teaching you the first way, to fight – fight against nature, fight against the world, fight against your own body, fight against the mind.</description>

The birth of doctrines from the decline of Tao
18 June 1972 pm in Immortal Study Circle
ON THE DECLINE OF THE GREAT TAO,
THE DOCTRINES OF HUMANITY AND JUSTICE AROSE. WHEN KNOWLEDGE AND CLEVERNESS APPEARED, GREAT HYPOCRISY FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE.
WHEN THE SIX RELATIONSHIPS NO LONGER LIVED AT PEACE, THERE WAS (PRAISE OF) ‘KIND PARENTS’ AND ‘FILIAL SONS’. WHEN A COUNTRY FELL INTO CHAOS AND MISRULE,</description>

The good shepherd – the butcher’s friend
16 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
ARE YOU ESPECIALLY AGAINST CHRISTIANITY?
I hate to favor Christianity with any special attention but unfortunately it deserves it. It is the ugliest manifestation of religion on the earth, for many reasons.
The first: Christianity is the only well-organized religion.
The more a religion is well-organized, the less is the possibility of its being a religion.</description>

Question 1
OSHO, WE FEEL THAT TO PENETRATE AND TRANSFORM THE DEEPER LAYERS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS ONLY THROUGH AWARENESS IS DIFFICULT AND NOT ENOUGH. WHAT ELSE SHOULD ONE DO OTHER THAN THE PRACTICE OF AWARENESS? PLEASE EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE PRACTICAL DIMENSIONS ON THIS MATTER.
THE UNCONSCIOUS can be transformed only through awareness. It is difficult, but there is no other way.</description>

The Manifestations of Prana in the Seven Bodies
QUESTION: WHAT IS PRANA AND HOW IS IT MANIFESTED IN EACH OF THE SEVEN BODIES?
Prana is energy – the living energy in us, the life in us. This life manifests itself, as far as the physical body is concerned, as the incoming and the outgoing breath. These are two opposite things. We take them as one.</description>

Deva avigan – divine harmony... and that’s what has to be attained.…

The boundary of man exists not. The boundary is just our imagination, because we begin nowhere and we end nowhere.</description>

[A sannyasin asked about a friend who was paralysed, and wondered if anything could be done to help. Osho suggested the friend should become a sannyasin, and then continued.]
If you are lying in bed all day and you can’t move, you will continuously want to, because movement is life. Nothing else is so important as movement.</description>

Maria comes from Hebrew; it means rebellion. And rebellion is the very flavor of sannyas, rebellion is my message. But remember the distinction – and the distinction is great – between rebellion and revolution. Revolution is an organized effort; rebellion is individual. Revolution becomes automatically political; rebellion remains religious, rebellion is part of spirituality.</description>

Prem means love, Narayana means God – love is God. And all else is just pseudo. All that goes on in the name of religion is just counterfeit... except love. Love is the real phenomenon that transforms. All else is just ritual. The ritual pacifies, consoles, but does not transmute. People need it, it is a kind of tranquilliser.</description>

Deva means divine, and Hakima is a sufi name for God. It means: all-mighty, all-powerful, omnipotent. Deva Hakima will mean ‘divine power.’ Man in himself is powerless; all power is from God. Man is just a vehicle, a passage. The moment man starts thinking ‘This is my power’, he starts falling into sin. The ego is the original sin and it is the ego that separates you from reality.</description>

6 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
PLEASE TALK ABOUT MORALITY.
Shantam Divyama, the question about morality is immensely significant, because morality is not that which has been told to you for centuries. All the religions have exploited the idea of morality. They have been teaching in different ways, but the basic foundation is the same: unless you become moral, ethical, you cannot become religious.</description>

Belief is a dirty word
24 August 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT EFFECT ON SCIENCE WOULD BE FELT IF PEOPLE STOPPED BELIEVING IN THE OLD RELIGIONS?
The fact of believing is the greatest barrier in the progress of science. In three hundred years science has done much in spite of all the religions, their superstitions, their beliefs. In these three hundred years, there would have been at least a hundred times more progress if religions had not come in the way at each step.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
OUTSIDE, THEN INSIDE – BEAUTY, UTTER BEAUTY. IS THERE MORE?
There is no end to it.
There is infinitely more.
You cannot exhaust it.
But one condition has to be remembered: You should not ask for it. You should not see it, because it comes on its own.</description>

[A sannyasin married couple bring their one-year-old daughter for sannyas.]
Deva tara... It means divine star. Tar means star, mm? – the english word ‘star’ comes from the sanskrit root ‘tara’. In sanskrit it is ‘sitara’; from sitara it has become tara in Hindi and star in English.</description>

TODAY, I OVERHEARD TWO BIBLE-BASHING A CHRISTIANS IN HEATED DEBATE WITH TWO SANNYASINS. I HEARD AND FELT FROM THE CHRISTIANS ANGER, NARROW-MINDEDNESS, AN ACUTE INABILITY TO LISTEN, AND AN UTTER LACK OF HUMOR. WHAT DID JESUS DO TO DESERVE SUCH FOLLOWERS?
IT is an absolute necessity to be retarded if you want to be a Christian.</description>

Healing is one of the most delicate dimensions. And the delicacy consists in the healer not doing anything in it. The healer is not really a healer because he is not a doer.</description>

Science discovers, art invents, religion does both. The true religion discovers; the pseudo-religion invents.
And down the ages it is the pseudo-religion that has prevailed over the human mind. It is nothing but fiction. It is closer to art, and absolutely against science.</description>

The gifts of the earth
17 January 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
AND A MERCHANT SAID, SPEAK TO US OF BUYING AND SELLING. AND HE ANSWERED AND SAID:
TO YOU THE EARTH YIELDS HER FRUIT, AND YOU SHALL NOT WANT IF YOU BUT KNOW HOW TO FILL YOUR HANDS.
IT IS IN EXCHANGING THE GIFTS OF THE EARTH THAT YOU SHALL FIND ABUNDANCE AND BE SATISFIED.</description>

19 January 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
.… Meditation is nothing but a remembrance of the kingdom that is yours, the kingdom that is within... of the kingship that everybody brings with himself into the world. A reminder is needed. Somebody has to shock you out of your sleep. That is the function of a master.</description>

I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. THE FIRST IS: YESTERDAY YOU SPOKE ON THE FUNCTION OF THE MASTER. I WOULD LIKE TODAY IF YOU COULD SPEAK ON THE FUNCTION OF THE DISCIPLE AND, IF THE DISCIPLE NEEDS THE MASTER, DOES THE MASTER NEED THE DISCIPLE?</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IN YOUR GOLDEN FUTURE, WILL THERE BE A TROUPE OF ENLIGHTENED ACTORS? IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MAN WHO IS ENLIGHTENED TO BE AN ACTOR?
Vimal, the enlightened man is an actor. He cannot be otherwise. He knows he’s not the body, yet he behaves as if he’s the body; he knows he’s not the mind, yet he responds as if he’s the mind.</description>

24 December 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Because of christmas eve I am giving you this name: christo prem.
Prem means love; love of christ. And christ is not a person. When the personality disappears, when the ego disappears, when the sense of ‘I’ disappears, christ is born.
Every time somebody reaches into his innermost core, christ is born again.</description>

A flower that has never known the sun and a flower that has encountered the sun are not the same. They cannot be. A flower that has never known the sunrise has never known the sun to rise within itself. It is dead; it is just a potentiality. It has never known its own spirit. But a flower that has seen the sun rise has also seen something arise within itself.</description>

Prem means love, nispati means conclusion. And there are two types of conclusion: one is logical, intellectual, another is of the heart. The logical conclusion is superficial; only the conclusion that arises in life through love is decisive. You can go on arguing and thinking round and round; thinking moves in a circle. It always feels as if something is happening, as if one is arriving, but one never arrives, and each conclusion simply begins to be another question.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
2 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Gudrun means divine wisdom. Wisdom is not knowledge. It has nothing to lo with knowing. It is a feeling, and ultimately it is being. These are three planes: knowing, feeling, being.
Knowing is the most superficial, feeling is in the middle, and being is at the very core. Ultimately wisdom is being, but in the beginning it is feeling, moving towards being.</description>

2 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Samarpano. It means absolute surrender, utter let-go. The mind is always in conflict with something or other; it needs conflict to exist. It can exist only in conflict and through conflict. It is a constant war, it is violence. It either fights with others or it starts fighting with itself, but one thing is certain about it, that it cannot exist without fight.</description>

SESSION 1
Om Mani Padme Hum
The Tibetans have got a mantra... Om Mani Padme Hum. The Lotus and the Jewel both together. It must have originated at a moment like this.
Om Mani Padme Hum
Om is simply an exclamation, it simply means “Ahhh!” or “Oohhh!” It is not a word, it is meaningless, but tremendously meaningful too. Meaningful in the sense of its beauty, its joy, its depth.</description>

[A seeker said that he had an experience following Kundalini meditation that had given him a great sense of joy. He had gazed at a tree and had become so filled with its beauty, so full of joy, that he felt he could not contain his feelings, and he became afraid.
Osho said that one’s capacity is limited in the beginning, but it increases as the joy increases.</description>

Prem Ellen. Prem means love; Ellen means light. Love is the only light there is in life. Love is the inner light. It needs no fuel; it is eternal. It is not caused by anything, hence it cannot be turned off. Anything that can be put on can be turned off. It is simply there; you cannot put it on, you cannot put it off.</description>

Hasiba. It means: one who satisfies. Without God there is no satisfaction possible. One can go on searching and one will find many things in life but nothing is going to satisfy. Just a moment’s illusion that one feels satisfaction, one has not even felt it and it is gone. Just a dewdrop slipping on the grass leaf: you have not even seen it correctly and it has disappeared, fallen.</description>

Deva means divine, sarla means innocence divine innocence. That is the way to know god. Knowledge is not the way, but innocence, a quality of childlikeness. We cannot approach reality through our calculating mind, because it is not a problem to be solved, it is not a problem at all. So mathematics, logic, can’t help.</description>

Anand Erik. Anand means bliss; erik means brave, courageous.
The root cause of misery is fear: we are too afraid of the unknown. We remain confined in the known, and because we remain confined in the known, life becomes a repetition, a circle; one goes on moving in the same circle again and again and again.</description>

Deva means divine, samvega means feeling, emotion. God is available through feeling and only through feeling. It is not a question of thinking; and the people who start thinking about god are bound to conclude that there is no god. Their very method prohibits it.

Deva means god, anuneeta means disciplined by – disciplined by the divine.
There are two types of discipline in life: one discipline that you can manage – but that is very ordinary discipline, man-made, home-made, and naturally cannot lead you very far. It is also repressive because you have to continuously fight and you have to repress many things in your being.</description>

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GRAMYA’S QUESTION ON TUESDAY WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME AS MINE ON SUNDAY, ONLY WORDED DIFFERENTLY. BUT YOU ANSWERED HER VERY LOVINGLY AND GENTLY AND ME WITH A THOUSAND-POUND SLEDGE HAMMER. OSHO, EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING THIS, BUT I TOO MEAN TO ASK LOVINGLY.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IS BLISSFULNESS AN EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TOWARDS EXISTENCE?
Sanjiva, it is just the reverse. Blissfulness is not an expression of gratitude; on the contrary, gratitude is an expression of blissfulness. First comes the experience of bliss. First you attain to the state of consciousness where ecstasy is natural, where your potential blossoms to its ultimate expression.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN THE OLDEN DAYS IT WAS CALLED MELANCHOLIA; TODAY IT IS CALLED DEPRESSION, AND IT COUNTS AS ONE OF THE MAJOR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IT IS DESCRIBED AS A SENSE OF DESPAIR OR HOPELESSNESS, A LACK OF SELF-ESTEEM WITH NO ENTHUSIASM OR INTEREST IN THE SURROUNDINGS.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU HAVE OFTEN USED THE WORD “EXISTENTIALISM,” AND YOU HAVE REFERRED TO YOURSELF AS AN EXISTENTIALIST. PLEASE DEFINE THESE WORDS.
There has been a contemporary school of philosophy in Europe called existentialism. I have nothing to do with it. That is only a philosophy, a mind game.</description>

OSHO, WILL YOUR DISCIPLES ATTAIN BY SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT, OR BY A SLOW, STEP-BY STEP GROWTH? IS YOUR PATHLESS PATH FOR ANYBODY, OR ONLY FOR RARE EXCEPTIONS?
THE first thing to be understood is that the very word “attainment” is nonspiritual. It is part of your greed. The idea to attain is very worldly.</description>

WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING AND WHAT IS MISUNDERSTANDING?
Dharmaraj,
Mind is misunderstanding – any kind of mind, good or bad, educated or uneducated, cultured or uncultured, Christian or Hindu; it does not matter what kind of mind it is. Mind as such is misunderstanding. Mind means you are carrying a priori conclusions; you are not seeing that which is, you are seeing that which you want to see.</description>

22 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THE JESUS I THOUGHT I KNEW AND LOVED FOR SO LONG?
The question is from Ma Deva Chintana. She has been a nun. She has suffered enough by being a nun, and suffered for sins she has never committed.
To be a nun is a kind of masochism, a kind of self-torture inflicted upon oneself in the name of Jesus, in the name of Buddha – only the names differ, the torture is the same.</description>

Deva Parmita, man is a search for the self – not for A self but for THE self. Man is constantly seeking the lost paradise: somewhere deep in the recesses of human beings, the nostalgia persists. We have known something that is only a far faraway memory, The memory is not even conscious; we have lost all track of it, where it is.</description>

Yes, it is. And the most selfish. There is nothing like it, it is incomparably selfish.
And one has to be selfish, there is no other way to be. And all the teachings that go on telling you not to be selfish have not helped; rather, they have distracted your being, they have made you unnatural.</description>

Dynamic Meditation
29 July 1970 pm
Question 1
WHAT IS DYNAMIC MEDITATION?
The first thing to be understood about Dynamic Meditation is that it is a method of creating a situation through tension in which meditation can happen. If your total being is completely tense, the only possibility that remains is relaxation. Ordinarily one cannot go directly into relaxation, but if your whole being is at a peak of total tension then the second step comes automatically, spontaneously: silence is created.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Ego’s attraction
2 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I FEEL A CONFLICT BETWEEN BEING LOOSE AND NATURAL AND BEING AWARE.
THERE IS NO conflict, but you can create a conflict. Even where no conflict exists the mind creates the conflict, because the mind cannot exist without being in conflict.
Being loose and natural will give you a spontaneous awareness.</description>

12 August 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
LATELY SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE ASKED ME IF I WAS SCEPTICAL TOWARDS SANNYAS, THE ASHRAM AND YOU. I HAD TO ADMIT TO THE TRUTH AND SAID, ‘YES, AT TIMES I AM.’ THIS LEFT ME WITH A FEELING OF GUILT. HAVE I COMMITTED SOME UNFORGIVABLE, SACRILEGIOUS CRIME OR IS IT NATURAL TO BE SCEPTICAL OUT OF BEING SURE?</description>

12 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND REPRESSION? ANUDEYA,
They are as distinct as the earth and the sky. The distance is so great between the two, that it is unbridgeable. Repression is just the opposite of discipline, but for thousands of years repression has been misunderstood and thought of as if it were discipline.</description>

WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THE SHORE FROM OUR BOAT, WE MISTAKENLY FEEL AS IF THE SHORE WERE MOVING. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR BOAT WITH CARE, WE FIND THAT IT IS OUR BOAT THAT IS ACTUALLY MOVING. SIMILARLY, WHEN WE SEE ALL THINGS WITH THE DELUDED IDEA THAT OUR BODY AND MIND ARE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER, WE MISTAKENLY THINK INNATE MIND AND NATURE ARE ETERNAL.</description>

2 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
DO YOU BELIEVE IN YOU? DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? WHO IS GOD?
NO, I DON’T BELIEVE IN ME... I CANNOT, BECAUSE I AM NOT. There is nobody I to be believed in, and nobody to believe in it either.

One expansion is external. The eyes look out; the hands feel the touch of external objects; the ears hear the outside sounds. But there is an expansion within also, which the eyes cannot see the ears cannot hear, and bands cannot touch. That is why, perhaps, what is within remains unknown and unfamiliar.</description>

Jesus is always a stranger. It does not matter whether you were brought up as a Catholic or a Protestant or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. The very being of Jesus is that of a stranger, because he is an outsider.</description>

Man is also a seed, a possibility, a potential, a hop, a promise. But the seed is not yet the flower. In essence it has the capacity of millions of flowers, but not in reality. Those flowers have to be actualized.</description>

“WHAT YOU HEAR MUST FIRST BE ACCEPTED BY YOUR REASON; AND WHEN YOUR RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING IS DEEPENED AND SUBTILIZED IN AN INEFFABLE WAY, YOUR MIND WILL, OF ITS OWN SPONTANEITY, BECOME COMPREHENSIVE AND BRIGHT, NEVER TO RELAPSE INTO THE STATE OF DOUBT AND DELUSION.</description>

Innocence: Lost and Found Again
28 December 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN WHEN YOU DIE?
Prem Pramod,
There is no heaven anywhere, it is here. It is always here, it is never there. It is always now, it is never then. The very idea of heaven somewhere else – there, then – is a strategy of the mind to deceive you, to keep you ignorant of the heaven that surrounds you every moment.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO STAY WITH YOUR OWN CLARITY AS A CHILD AND NOT LET YOURSELF BECOME INTIMIDATED BY THE GROWN-UPS AROUND YOU? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COURAGE FROM?
Innocence is courage and clarity both.
There is no need to have courage if you are innocent.</description>

26 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS THE DESIRE FOR PERFECTION?
ADHEERA, THE DESIRE FOR PERFECTION is the search for the lost womb. The paradise – lost. The child is utterly happy in the mother’s womb; that memory persists. It is not just a memory in the brain, it is in every cell of the body, every fiber of the body.</description>

WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO FORGIVE, TO STOP CLINGING TO HURTS LONG SINCE PAST?
Anand Katyayani,
The ego exists on misery – the more misery the more nourishment for it. In blissful moments the ego totally disappears, and vice versa: if the ego disappears, bliss starts showering on you.</description>

Letters to Ma Dharm Jyoti
FIRST PUBLISHED IN OTI 1 SEPTEMBER 1990
Beloved Dharm Jyoti,
Love. Don’t ever repress the mind. Repression is a disease.
And that which is repressed will never be completed. It comes back again and again to attack you.
The mind is to be understood.
Finally, only understanding the mind becomes the solution. Repression is merely postponement of diseases.
The path is neither in indulgence nor repression.</description>

WHAT IS GOD?
Prem Sukavi,
GOD is not a person. That is one of the greatest misunderstandings, and it has prevailed so long that it has become almost a fact. Even if a lie is repeated continuously for centuries it is bound to appear as if it is a truth.</description>

[The following is a poem in Osho’s handwriting, which he wrote specially for this booklet of poems by Rati Sett.]
LIVING IS LOVE
when gladness glides
in the deep lake of silence, warm breath of love
hums an unheard song. when open sky is wide awake under thy gaze
fog of doubt melts away and, fragrant breeze reveals the sweet pollen of bliss.</description>

3 May 1970 am in
The universe is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of it. What we see as matter, what we see as stone, is also energy. What is seen as life, what is experienced as thought, what is felt like consciousness is also a trans formation of energy. The whole cosmos – whether it is the waves of the sea or the pine trees of the forest or the grains of sand or the stars in the skies or that which is within us – all are manifestations of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS MEDITATION?
IT is the most important question as far as my religion is concerned. Meditation is the very center of my whole effort.
It is the very womb out of which the new religion is going to be born.
But it is very difficult to verbalize it.</description>

Question 1
IN ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS DISCOURSES YOU SAID THAT A SUDDEN AND DIRECT DESCENT OF GRACE CAN BECOME A DISASTER SOMETIMES. THE PERSON MIGHT BE HARMED OR BECOME MAD OR HE MAY EVEN DIE. A QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES: IS GRACE NOT ALWAYS BENEFICIAL? DOES GRACE NOT KEEP ITS OWN EQUILIBRIUM?</description>

16 October 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
ON FIRST ENTERING NANSEN’S MONASTERY, JOSHU WAS MADE TO SERVE IN THE KITCHEN AS THE STOKER. ONE DAY HE CLOSED ALL THE DOORS AND PILED WOOD ON THE FIRE UNTIL THE WHOLE KITCHEN WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE. THEN HE SHOUTED, “FIRE! FIRE! COME TO MY RESCUE!”
WHEN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY HAD FLOCKED TO THE DOOR, HE SAID, “I WILL NOT OPEN THE DOOR UNLESS YOU CAN SAY THE RIGHT WORD.</description>

19 June 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS, I HAVE BEEN WORKING PHYSICALLY QUITE HARD IN THE GARDEN. I LOVED THE WORK VERY MUCH, AND I FELT DEEPLY CONNECTED TO YOU. IT WAS AS IF YOUR CREATIVITY AND GRACE WERE BLISSFULLY FLOWING THROUGH ME. BUT SOMEHOW IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, I HAVE FALLEN OUT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF OLD GHOSTS TURNING UP AGAIN: IMPATIENCE, COMPETITIVENESS, PERFECTIONISM, LOTS OF ANGER AND SERIOUSNESS.</description>

Question 1
WHAT I MEAN BY SANNYAS IS A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE SO THAT ONE BECOMES A RELIGIOUS PERSON, BUT IT IS NOT HAPPENING TO ME. WHAT TO DO?
MY SANNYAS IS NOT A DISCIPLINE. My sannyas is freedom, freedom from all control – even from self-control. A controlled man is a dead man.</description>

PEACE OF MIND CAN BE GAINED BY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WORLD, BY STILLING THE VORTICES OF THE MIND. BUT HOW MUCH INNER PEACE IS APPROPRIATE IN A WORLD THAT CONTAINS ATTICA, VIETNAM, JOHANNESBURG, BIAFRA, PAKISTAN AND SUB-SAHARA AFRICA?

There will be darkness even if the eyes are closed or open. But there would be difference if that person keeps on sitting with his eyes closed when morning comes, the sun is rising, the rays the of the sun are falling on the door of the cave and birds begin to sing.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
IS ENLIGHTENED CONSCIOUSNESS LESS SPICY THAN ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS?
CONSCIOUSNESS IS ONE. You cannot divide it in two. Consciousness is indivisible. You cannot say ‘ordinary consciousness’ and ‘enlightened consciousness’ – consciousness means enlightenment.
The ordinary person is not conscious, he is unconscious. He believes he is conscious – his very belief prevents him from becoming conscious.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The mysterious original current – Tao
20 June 1971 pm in Immortal Study Circle
(CONCEIVED OF AS) HAVING NO NAME, IT IS THE ORIGINATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH; THE NAMED IS THE MOTHER OF ALL THINGS.
Existence has no specific name. It is name-less. Objectification takes place as soon as a name is given.
Every object is a part of the boundless existence as long as it is unnamed.</description>

The Mystery Beyond Mind
11 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
BELOVED OSHO, BEAUTIFUL WHITE CLOUD, WHY ARE WE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU WITH US – AND WHY ARE WE WITH YOU?
Why’s are always unanswerable. To the mind it seems that whenever you can ask a why it can be answered. But that is one of the fallacious assumptions.</description>

The mystery of meditation
4 February 1971 pm in
Question 1
WHAT IS MEDITATION?
Meditation is not an Indian method; it is not simply a technique. You cannot learn it. It is a growth: a growth of your total living, out of your total living. Meditation is not something that can be added to you as you are. It can come to you only through a basic transformation, a mutation.</description>

ONE OF THE TITLES OF THE MASTER’S PRESS IS A “HISTORY OF THE FUTURE”. IT IS A BOOK THAT PUTS TOGETHER ALL THE VIEWS OF THE KNOWN PROPHECIES ABOUT OUR FUTURE, AND TRIES TO SHOW WHAT OUR WORLD WILL BE LIKE IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS.</description>

The Night is over
2 August 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, devayan means divine vehicle – love, the divine vehicle. Love takes you to the ultimate and love also brings the ultimate to you; it is a double-edged sword. It is like a ladder: you can go up and down by the same ladder. And the meeting happens somewhere in the middle.</description>

30 January 1972 pm in Immortal Study Circle
WHEN THE INTELLIGENT SOUL AND THE ANIMAL SOUL ARE HELD TOGETHER IN ONE EMBRACE, THEY CAN BE KEPT FROM SEPARATING.
WHEN ONE GIVES UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO THE (VITAL) BREATH AND BRINGS IT TO THE UTMOST DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY, HE CAN BECOME LIKE A (TENDER) BABE.</description>

30 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF NONVIOLENCE AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN DOGMA OF TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK?
I am not a philosopher. The philosopher thinks about things. It is a mind approach. My approach is a no-mind approach. It is just the very opposite of philosophizing.</description>

Many questions are there. The first:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL YOGA AND TANTRA? ARE THEY THE SAME?
Tantra and yoga are basically different. They reach to the same goal; however, their paths are not only different, but contrary also. So this has to be understood very clearly.</description>

Sagar,
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER because Zen is not a philosophy, it is not a doctrine. It is an experience, an experience of your own interiority, of your own subjectivity – not an objective experience. If it were some object outside you, there would be a possibility of describing it, of analyzing it, of defining it.</description>

To define is to confine – existence has no boundaries

Question 1 OSHO,
WHY DO I FEEL THAT IF LIFE IS MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY? IT SEEMS THAT I AM DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEING ALONE. HOW CAN I GO TOTALLY INTO MY ALONENESS WITH JOY INSTEAD OF FEAR?

I am very pleased to be present among you. Certainly, on this occasion, I would like to share some of my heartfelt views with you.
It is painful to see the present condition of education. Birth of a free and healthy man is not possible in a condition where, in the name of education, all sorts of slaveries are nourished.</description>

Yoga: the Growth of Consciousness
The evolution of life is to become more and more conscious, but the consciousness is always other oriented: you are conscious of some thing, some object. Yoga means to be evolving in the dimension where there is no object and only consciousness remains. Yoga is the method of evolving toward pure consciousness; not being conscious of something, but being consciousness itself.</description>

4 January 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A woman says she has been doing yoga in the West.]
Good, very good. So you are ready, now meditate. Yoga in itself is not enough. It is a good preparation, but preparation for something else.
It prepares your body/mind, but if you go on preparing and preparing and never doing the thing for which yoga was preparing you, then it can become an obsession.</description>

20 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Vedant means that which is beyond scriptures; Satyam means truth. The full name will mean truth which is beyond scriptures.
Truth is not something that can be described. Truth is not a theory: it is an experience, an experience so deep, so tremendously intense, so infinite, so mysterious, that no word is adequate to explain it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 20
20 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Veet means beyond, Vivarta means argument. Truth is beyond argument. It cannot be proved, it cannot be disproved either. All argumentation about truth is utterly futile. Hence philosophy goes on missing the point. That’s the difference between philosophy and religion: philosophy argues, religion experiences. Through argument you go about and about, round and round in circles, but you never penetrate the core of the problem.</description>

Anand Ron. Anand means bliss; Ron means power. Bliss has a power of its own, very different from any other power, qualitatively different from any other power. All other powers are destructive, violent. Bliss has a non-violent power, the power of love. Bliss has the power to bless others. It is not destructive, it is creative energy; it only creates.</description>

[Osho gives sannyas to a six-year-old.]
Prem means love, Wahid is a sufi name for God – it means: the one – love for the one.
Right now it may not be possible for you to understand, but let it become a seed in your heart; one day you will understand. There are two kinds of love: love for the many – and that’s where everybody lives and suffers – and there is another kind of love: love for the one; that’s where bliss happens.</description>

Deva means divine and shraddhan means trust. But remember that it doesn’t mean belief. Belief is a pseudo substitute for trust. Belief in fact is just the opposite of trust – notwithstanding what the dictionaries say. Belief is a head thing, and trust is of the heart. Belief is dead and borrowed – trust is alive and kicking.</description>

Deva means divine, sarlo means simplicity divine simplicity. And simplicity is one of those things which cannot be cultivated. If cultivated then it is simplicity no more; it is already complex. If cultivated, it is already calculated. If cultivated, it is projection of the mind. Simplicity is something that cannot be manufactured by the mind.</description>

[Osho gives sannyas to someone who had great difficulty to decide to take sannyas, because of her commitments in the West.]
The decision was difficult – decisions are always difficult but it is good to be decisive. Sometimes one may even take a wrong decision; then too it is better to be decisive rather than remaining indecisive, because in indecisiveness one disintegrates, one becomes fragments; one has a centre no more.</description>

Intellect is bitter, intellect is argumentative, intellect is sceptical. Intelligence is a totally different affair. It is basically love. It is not negative; it is yea-saying, it is affirmative, it is positive.
Intellect is negative; it is nay-saying.</description>

Life is a paradox, the mind requires consistency, hence the mind can never meet life. The mind is death. Life’s very existence depends on contradictions, it exists through the contradiction. The contradiction creates the challenge: day and night, man and woman, love and hate. Love cannot exist without hate; there is no possibility.</description>

Don’t drop – transform!
20 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO I CLING TO MY MISERY? WHY CAN I NOT DROP IT?
The I, the ego, is not something separate from the misery, that’s why it is absolutely impossible for anyone to drop it. Who is going to drop it? They are not two, the dropper and the dropped.</description>

HIGHER THAN HEAVEN, THE ULTIMATE TRUTH ABIDES IN THE CAVE OF THE HEART, SHINING, AND THE SINCERE SEEKER ATTAINS.

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
CAN YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE ART OF NOURISHING ONESELF WITH LOVE? I FEEL SO MUCH LOVE FOR YOU! IS THIS ENOUGH?
Deva Bhasha, love is never enough. There are mysteries in existence which don’t have any limitation. Love is the closest experience to understanding all those mysteries – because as far as the mind is concerned, it imposes limits; it cannot accept anything that is unlimited.</description>

The convalescent
17 April 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO, THE CONVALESCENT
ONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS CAVE, ZARATHUSTRA PASSES THROUGH A PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS WHEN HE IS AS DEAD. WHEN HE FINALLY COMES TO HIMSELF, HE FINDS HE IS SURROUNDED BY FRUITS AND SWEET-SMELLING HERBS BROUGHT TO HIM BY HIS ANIMALS. ON SEEING HIM AWAKE, HIS ANIMALS ASK ZARATHUSTRA IF HE WOULD NOT NOW STEP OUT INTO THE WORLD WHICH IS WAITING FOR HIM: ‘THE WIND IS LADEN WITH HEAVY FRAGRANCE THAT LONGS FOR YOU AND ALL THE BROOKS WOULD LIKE TO RUN AFTER YOU,’ THEY TELL HIM.</description>

The pagan: chrysalis of consciousness
17 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WERE PAGANS RELIGIOUS?
THE Christians have given such a condemnatory definition to the word pagan that it has become almost the meaning of the word. To be a pagan, according to the Christians, is to be irreligious. The reality is just the reverse.
Christianity is a pseudo-religion.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I AM ONE OF THE STARGAZERS, IDEALISTS, NAIVE. I LEARNED FROM YOU ABOUT TRUSTING EXISTENCE TOTALLY. BUT I UNDERSTOOD TOTAL TRUST TO MEAN JUST THAT – TOTAL TRUST, TRUST UNTO DEATH. SO I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHEN MY OWN MASTER SUPPORTED PROTECTING OURSELVES WITH GUNS AND SEARCHING VISITORS, OR EVEN JUST BUYING INSURANCE.</description>

REVEAL THY SIMPLE SELF, EMBRACE THY ORIGINAL NATURE, CHECK THY SELFISHNESS, CURTAIL THY DESIRES.

Question 1
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REAL SELF AND NO-SELF
Aneesha, the no-self is the real self; there is no difference at all. It is just a different way of expressing the same thing. The “real self” is a positive way of expressing it, and “no-self” the negative way.</description>

THE SCIENTIFIC VISION OF OBJECTIVE REALITY AND THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF EXISTENCE SEEM TO BE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND UNBRIDGEABLE DIMENSIONS. IS THIS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THINGS, OR IS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION OF OUR MIND?

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS ENLIGHTENMENT THE ONLY WAY A DISCIPLE CAN TRULY EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE TO HER MASTER?
Maneesha, even enlightenment is not enough to express the gratitude the disciple has for the master. There is simply no way.
The gratitude of the disciple remains unexpressed. It is one of those mysteries which can be experienced but cannot be explained.</description>

But this foolish idea of being a world teacher is very ancient in India. Shankara, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbaraka, and hundreds of others down the ages have claimed that they are the world teachers.</description>

Mm, it’s natural. When you allow love to come out, hate will also come out. That’s why many people repress their love – because they have been taught to repress their hate and they are both aspects of the same energy.</description>

11 March 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A sannyasin said that during after the meditations she was shaking very much, and she felt really shattered.]
You must be trying to control it – that is wrong.
Fever can come because you create a contradiction in your being. The energy is arising, and you start controlling it. You are doing two opposite things together.</description>

24 June 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva Louis. Deva means God; Louis means victory. God is our only victory. Nothing else can make us victorious. Everything else ends in failure, unexceptionally. Without failure, everything falls into failure.
There are many illusions in life, very attractive, but they are attractive only from the distance. As you come closer you become disillusioned.</description>

[A visitor says she doesn’t want to take sannyas because to wear orange and mala will be difficult at home. Then asks about her boyfriend, who is more spiritual and ascetic than her, which causes difficulties.]
A relationship can never be without difficulties and if there is love, then there are more difficulties. This may look strange but it is one of the most fundamental facts of life to be understood: if there is no love, a relationship can move very smoothly Hence many societies in the past have decided for marriage without love.</description>

They are not two geographical situations – they are inner attitudes... you create them. They are not things – they are just your mind trips.</description>

Deva means divine, vismayo means wonder – divine wonder. And there is nothing more divine in life than wonder. Just as knowledge prevents one getting in tune with god, wonder bridges one. Wonder is the polar opposite of knowledge. Knowledge kills wonder. The more a man becomes knowledgeable, his capacity to wonder becomes less and less.</description>

[Osho and warns a new sannyasin that much is going to happen so not to be afraid!]
It is very natural that when something really starts happening one becomes frightened, because we have become so accustomed to a life where nothing happens, so when something starts happening one gets frightened. We want it to happen, but when it really starts happening we become afraid because we have become very much accustomed to a dull and dead routine life.</description>

Anand means bliss, malik means god, lord – god of bliss, lord of bliss. Malik is a sufi name for God. ‘Ya Malik’ means ‘oh, Lord’. Sufis have ninety-nine names for God and one wonders why not one hundred; the list seems to be incomplete. The hundredth is the real name which cannot be uttered.</description>

Very good work. To be with children is one of the most beautiful things. But one has to learn it, otherwise it can be the most tedious thing in the world. One has to love it, otherwise it is one of the most boring things.</description>

Veet Cyrena. Veet means beyond, cyrena means one who can take control. My teaching is that one has to go beyond all control, one has to learn to be free, one has to exist as freedom, not as control.
Control is not beautiful; it is ugly, it is repressive. You have to force things on yourself.</description>

[Veet means beyond, Osho explains, and amo means darkness: beyond the darkness is the dawn.]
The darkness is not something outside, it is something inside; hence the light is also not going to happen from the outside, it has to arise within. No outer light can dispel inner darkness. Only the inner can function on the inner.</description>

Deva Debbie. Deva means divine, debbie means bee – a divine bee.
The bee is always searching for the lotus, hence it is a symbol of the seeker of truth. The lotus is the ultimate symbol of one’s flowering, hence in the East the ultimate state of samadhi is called the one-thousand-petaled lotus. Once the bee has entered into the lotus it never comes back.</description>

Enlightenment is not something special, it is one of the most simple, natural phenomena. Just because it is so simple and natural it has become extraordinarily difficult for man to understand.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HEARD YOU SPEAK OF SCIENTISTS CHOOSING FUTURE PEOPLE FROM THEIR GENETIC ANALYSIS OF SPERMS. I HAVE NO TRUST IN SCIENTISTS, OR DOCTORS OR ANYBODY WHOSE KNOWLEDGE EXTENDS NO FURTHER THAN THEIR HEAD. I INTUITIVELY FEEL THAT GENETICS PLAYS ONLY A SMALL ROLE IN DETERMINING WHAT A PERSON BECOMES.</description>

Prem means love, parijato is a flower, the name of a flower. Prem Parijato will mean a flower of love.
Man never blooms without love. Love is like spring: once you are in love, hidden possibilities start manifesting themselves, that which was latent before starts arising, surfacing. All the colours and all the fragrance that one contains are released.</description>

They have offered to you because they wanted to purchase you. It was an insult to your humanity.
The very effort to convert anybody is trespassing his spiritual territory. It is an effort to enslave you through some doctrines, logic, but basically it is not a spiritual endeavor, it is political, the politics of numbers.</description>

THE OTHER COURTIERS WERE JEALOUS OF AYAZ AND OBSERVED HIS EVERY MOVEMENT, INTENDING TO DENOUNCE HIM FOR SOME SHORTCOMING, THUS ENCOMPASSING HIS DOWNFALL.</description>

IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK AGAIN. SITTING IN YOUR DISCOURSE I FIND MYSELF CONNECTING WITH MY INSIDE TO AN EXTENT THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN IN THE WEST. WHAT IS THIS ALCHEMY?

WHO WAS THE MASTER WHO DISCOVERED OR INVENTED THE LATIHAN MEDITATION TECHNIQUE? WOULD YOU LIKE EXPLAIN THIS MEDITATION TECHNIQUE?
Latihan is a unique method – unique in the sense that it is the only method that has come out of this century, and unique also because it happened to a man who was not searching for truth, who was not a seeker.</description>

Mm, close your eyes, and go in. Feel you are going in. You are not the body; keep that in your consciousness. The body is far away... surrounding you but you are not it. And neither are you the mind.

‌He is absolutely in agreement with my idea that nothing should be repressed, everything should be expressed. If you feel like crying, cry; there is no harm in it, it is absolutely in accord with nature. If you feel like doing anything that is arising in you with a great urge, do it, because once done you are freed from it.
If each moment we go on doing everything naturally, we don&#39;t accumulate in the storehouse of consciousness any rubbish, any crap.</description>

Unless we disappear, God cannot appear: the death of the ego is the birth of God. One has to efface oneself completely. Even if a little bit of the ego is left, that is enough – enough to remain a barrier between you and God.</description>

[A sannyasin had written a letter about relationship with his girlfriend, who was living in London, and who wished to be married to him. He was uncertain as to what was the best thing to do as he had reservations about marriage but was in love with her.]
One thing – don’t get married.</description>

10 October 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A visitor says about taking sannyas: That’s the big fear – not the fear of being a sannyasin, but the fear of the betrayal of my previous initiation. It’s still there lingering on and I feel like a Judas or something.]
Not at all... not at all. That’s a very wrong attitude to take about things.</description>

‌CHAPTER 22
22 June 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, nirakar means formless. Misery has a form, bliss has no form. Misery is definable, bliss is not. You can pinpoint where misery is; you cannot do the same with bliss. Misery is small; bliss is vast. Misery is smaller than you; bliss is infinite. Misery is always in you; bliss never in you.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I have had a dream for years... It is only a feeling – I have no pictures, nothing, but it’s a feeling. There’s a feeling of death.
Osho checks his energy.]
The dream is significant and has much to convey to you. It is not just a rubbish dream; it is a good indication of something that is going to happen.</description>

25 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Love knows how to forgive. Not only does one have to forgive others, one has to forgive oneself too, and that is the harder thing because we have been taught to feel guilty; we are burdened by guilt. A burdened man cannot grow and one who feels guilty feels always sick; he does not allow his wounds to heal.</description>

11 September 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, and tarpana means sacrifice – divine sacrifice, or sacrifice to the divine. And that’s what life really is. Unless it becomes a sacrifice, an offering, you go on missing it. Unless you give your life totally, you miss it. And there is no way ordinarily to give it totally except to give it to God, because only the total can become the receptor of a total gift.</description>

Prem Patrizia. Prem means love; patrizia means of noble birth.
Love comes from God; it is not only noble, it is divine too. Love is not something human, it is not something of the earth; it comes from the beyond. Hence the uplifting force of it: the moment it starts touching your heart it gives you wings.</description>

22 November 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, vidheya means positivity, acceptability, affirmation, the quality of saying yes to existence – and that is the greatest religious quality. In fact only that quality makes a person religious. Renouncing the no is renouncing the mind. The mind exists by saying no, the mind is basically negativity. Its whole existence is that of denial.</description>

22 April 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva Julia. Deva means divine, julia means youthful. God is always young. The idea of an old God is just rubbish, because existence is always young. To be in God means to remain fresh and young, and the way towards God is being more and more youthful. The body will become old – that’s the nature of matter; matter is always old because matter is dead.</description>

Bliss knows only one space: the space that is created around the here, and knows only one time: that is created around now. If you think in terms of then and there you will remain miserable; that is the way of misery.</description>

[Anand Rupen – Bliss beauty]
Bliss is the ultimate state of consciousness. Bliss is not possible unless the mind is completely gone. It is the absence of the mind; it happens only in the absence of the mind. And the mind is the source of all ugliness, all negativities – hatred, anger, jealousy, possessiveness; all that comes from the mind.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I’ve been avoiding you for a year now.] That’s a good indication!...
That means that something is going to happen so the mind is afraid. The mind is never afraid without any real cause, so the people who avoid me are the people who are going to be transformed by me.</description>

Deva means divine, abhinanda means joy – divine joy. Ordinarily what we think is joy is not joy; at the most it is entertainment. It is just a way to avoid oneself. It is a way to intoxicate yourself, it is a way to be drowned in something so you can forget your misery, your worry, your anguish, your anxiety.</description>

22 February 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means god, the divine element – not exactly god, but godly. God is more of an energy than a person, so in the east, rather than saying that god exists, we have been saying that the world is divine. God is not a separate element from the world but is its intrinsic quality, an inner presence – not somebody who has created the world and then either has forgotten all about it or is no more interested, or has become interested in some other projects.</description>

[Anand Yuri – farmer of bliss.]
Gautam the Buddha used to say again and again: I am the farmer, I sow the seeds of bliss. There is a way of inner farming, of creating a garden of the inner. Many never become aware of it; they are the unfortunate ones. Otherwise it is just so close – just a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn and it is in front of you.</description>

Prem means love, rito means the way – the way of love. There are two ways to reach to god: one is that of love, and the other is that of awareness. They are diametrically opposite to each other, but in the end they meet. In the beginning they are as far away from each other as possible, the distance is infinite in the beginning, but as one progresses, the distance becomes less and less.</description>

Anand means bliss, aikanto means aloneness – the bliss of being alone. There is a kind of bliss which arises in relationship, in love, with people. But there is also a blissfulness which arises when you are simply, utterly alone. The first bliss can only be momentary because it depends on the interaction of two persons.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DURING THE AWARENESS WALK IN THE VIPASSANA GROUP TODAY, I OBSERVED THAT MY SPEED WAS SLOWING DOWN AND HAD STOPPED. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO NEED FOR MOVING. TO WHERE, FOR WHAT? THERE WAS SIMPLY NO GOAL ANYMORE.
OSHO, WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE SECRET OF BEING IN A BODY AND WHAT KEEPS IT MOVING?</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ACCORDING TO MY DICTIONARY, A CULT IS “A RELIGION REGARDED AS UNORTHODOX OR SPURIOUS” – “SPURIOUS” MEANING “OF ILLEGITIMATE BIRTH, BASTARD.”
IS IT NOT TRUE TO SAY THAT THE REAL SPIRIT OF RELIGIOUSNESS CAN NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UNORTHODOX; AND WILL ALWAYS BE INSPIRED BY A LOVE UNION, RATHER THAN BORN OUT OF A LEGALIZED CONTRACT?</description>

September 28, 1970 was a memorable day. At Manali in the Himalayas, Osho initiated His first group of sannyasins. This event was followed by this special evening discourse, on the significance of Neo Sannyas.
To me, sannyas does not mean renunciation; it means a journey to joy bliss. To me, sannyas is not any kind of negation; it is a positive attainment.</description>

MOVING INTO ALONENESS, INTO SUCH SILENCE, PEACE AND BLISS, I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT AT THE SAME TIME I WAS COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOU. DANCING WITH YOUR LOVE, NEVER BEFORE HAVE I BEEN IN SUCH A SPACE – COMING HOME AT LAST. BUT I HAVE TO GO SOON, AND I AM SO AFRAID TO LOSE IT.</description>

You are the only hope
20 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU A MESSIAH, A PROPHET, OR A REINCARNATION OF GOD?
I have never expected that one of my sannyasins would ask such a bullshit question!
I am simply myself. I am not a messiah, because there is no God to send messengers to the world. Moreover, I don’t want to be crucified.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
22 July 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss and sandesh means a message – a message of bliss... and you have to become one. Walking, sitting, doing something, not doing something, remain blissful. Allow bliss to happen more and more; don’t obstruct it. It is nothing to be positively achieved; only negative barriers should be removed. One needs nothing to be blissful except the readiness to surrender to it.</description>

[A sannyasin returned to darshan after having over-eaten consciously for seven days as Osho had suggested, as she was concerned that she was stuffing herself. She says: Well I’m not interested in food anymore!]
Good. That’s how the mind works: if you want not to eat, then the desire arises to eat too much.</description>

23 February 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, mouna means silence. And silence is going to help you tremendously, so drop as much inner talk as possible. Start renouncing thoughts, don’t get identified with them. Start creating a distance between you and the constantly moving traffic of thought. Neglect, ignore, be indifferent to them. Let them be there as uninvited guests if they want.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
19 August 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, the ultimate state of consciousness when there is nothing to be blissful about... just pure bliss, uncaused. That is the difference between bliss and happiness. Happiness needs a cause for it to exist. Bliss needs no cause. And when happiness needs a cause, it can create unhappiness, because the cause is always beyond you; you cannot do anything about it.</description>

24 August 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand Barbara. Anand means bliss; barbara means a stranger.
The world becomes misery if you start thinking that you are part of it; if you become identified with it, then it is going to become a misery. Identification is the root cause of all misery. If you can remember that you are a stranger here, a visitor, a tourist, only for a few days, and the world is not more than a caravanserai – we stay the night and in the morning we go – if you can remain alert of this phenomenon, that we come from somewhere else and one day we have to go back to the original source, then bliss starts growing in you like roses in a rosebush.</description>

Deva means divine, amito means limitless, infinity, unbounded – divine unboundedness. And that’s how existence is. All limitations are our imagination, because things are not separate; things are parts of each other. You see the tree – it seems so separate standing there alone in the field; it is not. Its roots are in the earth, it is part of the earth.</description>

And bliss has something to do with height, with plenitude. It takes you to the peaks, it takes you to the ultimate plenitude, beyond which one cannot go.
Bliss is the omega point, and everybody is seeking that peak. Sometimes one may be seeking a wrong way, may be moving in a cul-de-sac or may be thinking that one is going up and is actually going down, but still the unconscious desire is for the peak.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
23 October 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Sansar means the world, atosha means discontent – discontent with the world... that is the beginning of the search. Those who are contented with the world are unfortunate, they are contented with the trivia; they are simply wasting their opportunity to grow. They are contented with toys. The world consists of all kinds of toys; that is the meaning of the word sansar.</description>

Ma Anand Kosha. Anand means bliss, kosha means body – body of bliss.
In the East we have discovered that man consists of five bodies. Five layers of bodies are there; we don’t have one body, we have five bodies. And the first, the most superficial body, is the physical body, and the last, the most subtle body, is the body of bliss.</description>

[A sannyasin asks about becoming a Primal therapist.]
It is always good to find something that you like – because it is your life; it should not be wasted in any way. And if you have the feeling that you don’t like any job and that you have to do it, it becomes destructive.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
24 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, anando means bliss. Love and bliss are two aspects of the same energy. They always happen together: if one happens, the other follows, has to follow. They cannot be divided, they are indivisible. And just like that, hate and misery are two aspects of the same phenomenon: the person who is full of hate can never be blissful; and the person who is full of love can never be anything else other than blissful.</description>

Deva means divine, anunada means vibration. You have to meditate much on vibrations and you have to learn how to vibrate in tune with the whole. When a person is too self-conscious he vibrates against the whole. When a person is no more self-conscious, simply conscious with no self in it, then he vibrates with the whole.</description>

Prem means love; roger is Teutonic, it means spear. Love is like a spear: the moment it penetrates the heart it is the greatest agony possible, but beyond the agony is the ecstasy. Love is pain, pure pain, but out of the fire of pure pain, bliss is born. The pain is the price we pay for the bliss.</description>

Prem means love, anneke means grace. Love is the only experience in life which makes you aware of the presence of god. And to be aware of the presence of god is to be full of grace; suddenly one is overflowing with grace. The benediction is such, the blessing is such, that one becomes a blessing to existence through it.</description>

23 January 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, hiram is Hebrew: it means most noble. Bliss is noble when it arises spontaneously, without any effort on your part, when it is a sheer gift from god. You have not begged for it, you have not desired it, you have not asked for it. When it is given out of the overflowing energy of existence and you are only a passive receiver, just an empty vessel, just like a womb, feminine – waiting with great expectancy but with no expectations, ready to wait for infinity, for eternity, but not in any way in a hurry to snatch something from existence – that’s nobility of the soul.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, ENLIGHTENMENT AND WOMEN ARE JUST GREAT. BUT WHAT ABOUT PRACTICALLY SPEAKING?
Milarepa, without women there would not have been any enlightenment. That’s the reason why women themselves don’t become enlightened; they are continuously engaged in making men enlightened. They don’t have time enough for themselves.</description>

Prem means love, saburo means waiting – waiting is love. And that’s really what meditation is: waiting for the unknown to happen. We cannot make it happen. Whatsoever we do will always be a repetition of the known, because we are the known. There is no way for us to make the unknown happen.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
IS THERE ANY POINT IN LIVING?
MAN has been brought up by all the traditions in a schizophrenic way.
It was helpful to divide man in every possible dimension, and create a conflict between the divisions. This way man becomes weak, shaky, fearful, ready to submit, surrender; ready to be enslaved by the priests, by the politicians, by anybody.</description>

No beginning – no end
12 February 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
MANY PEOPLE, WHEN THEY TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF CREATION, ARE PUZZLED: WHY DOES THE ULTIMATE, WHICH WAS ONE, HAVE TO BE IMMEDIATELY TWO AFTER CREATION? IN OTHER WORDS, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, MALE AND FEMALE, AND SO ON. THE ULTIMATE IN ALL ITS POWER, EXISTENCE, FULLNESS, COULD HAVE HELPED CREATION ON A MALE-MALE BASIS, ON A FEMALE-FEMALE BASIS, OR A JOINED TOGETHER BASIS, AS A THEOSOPHIST ONCE EXPLAINED.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WAY THAT DIFFERENT BUDDHIST MASTERS HAVE BEEN ADDING THEIR OWN FLAVOR TO BUDDHA’S TEACHING, I STARTED WONDERING WHETHER THERE WILL EVER BE ANYBODY ADDING A NEW FLAVOR TO YOUR POT. IT LOOKS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ADD A NEW SPICE TO SOMETHING WHICH ALREADY CONTAINS ALL THE SPICES WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THIS EARTH.</description>

That’s why poetry is impossible to translate, and a song still more difficult, because the words can be translated but not the rhythm.</description>

Deva means divine, nartaka means dancer – a divine dancer.
Dance, to me, is closest to the divine, because dance is the most existential activity. Thinking is farthest from existence. Dance is closest. And between the two is singing – singing is half- half; half thinking, half dancing. Thinking creates a barrier between you and existence; dancing dissolves that barrier.</description>

‌CHAPTER 24
1 May 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Dharma Deepam. It means light of religion, light of the law, light of the ultimate. Dharma means many things, but basically it means exactly what Tao means – the fundamental law of existence. It is used for religion because religion is also a fundamental law, life.
The english word ‘religion’ has very wrong connotations with it – sectarian, moral, theological; less concerned with the spontaneity of existence.</description>

‌CHAPTER 24
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, USA
I was saying to you that friendship is a higher value than love. Nobody has said it before. And I also say that friendliness is even higher than friendship. Nobody has even mentioned that. I will certainly have to explain.
Love, howsoever beautiful, remains earthbound. It is something like the roots of a tree. Love tries to rise above the earth and all that it implies – the body – but it falls again and again.</description>

5 October 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, natya means drama – a divine drama. And that’s what life is. It should not be taken seriously. The moment you take it seriously, you miss. It is a drama. Taken as a drama it is tremendously beautiful. One has nothing to lose in it and nothing to gain; it is simply fun.</description>

24 September 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, prartho means prayer. Love is not an act. It is a state. You cannot do it – you can only be it. And love is not a relationship either; it is a participation. In a relationship two persons become entangled with each other, intertwined. They create slavery for each other, a mutual kind of bondage.</description>

Prem Carolina. Prem means love; Carolina means freedom. And hitherto man has not been able to synthesize these two ultimate elements of life: love and freedom. Those who have chosen love have lost their freedom, and those who wanted to be free had to sacrifice their love.
That has been the history up to now and because of this, life has suffered very much, because life can grow only when both are available.</description>

24 June 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Hamido is a name of god, so it will mean god of love.
Only love gives the quality of being divine. All else is mundane, all else is just trivial. Only love is something of the beyond, non-material. In the world, except for love, there is no proof for god. So the man who does not know what love is will be incapable of knowing god – not only incapable of knowing but incapable of trusting, not only incapable of trusting but even incapable of comprehending the fact of god.</description>

Deva means divine, rashid means unerring quality. God is unerring, that is the meaning, and whatever mistakes happen in life, they happen because of us, not because of God. So never complain, and whenever you see something is going wrong, remember: it must be going wrong because of you.
Everything goes right if we surrender to God; everything settles, becomes harmonious.</description>

Deva Maturo, the question you have asked is certainly of great importance because meditation, as such, needs no technique at all. But techniques are needed to remove the obstacles in the way of meditation.

Blessed are those who doubt
29 August 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DOUBT AND NEGATIVITY? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
The difference between doubt and negativity is great.
They look alike; on the surface they have the same color, but deep down the difference is unbridgeable.
First, doubt is not negativity; neither is it positivity.</description>

Charisma: a taste of the divine
23 December 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS CHARISMA? ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE HAVE IT, BOTH AWARE PEOPLE AND UNAWARE PEOPLE. ITS SUCH AN INTANGIBLE QUALITY, I CAN SAY WHEN SOMEONE IS CHARISMATIC BUT CAN’T DEFINE WHAT IT IS.
Sudha, charisma is a mystery. It happens only to those people who have centered their being, concentrated their energies, who are no longer falling apart, who are consolidated, who have become one – the very meaning of the word, “individual.</description>

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS I AM AGAIN AND AGAIN REMINDED OF THE WORDS OF KAHLIL GIBRAN: “MAN CANNOT REAP LOVE UNTIL AFTER SAD AND REVEALING SEPARATION AND BITTER PATIENCE AND DESPERATE HARDSHIP.”

Deva means divine, prapata means a waterfall. The waterfall is symbolic of many things. The first: it seeks depth, it is always moving towards the depth. And that should be the search. God is not there high in heaven but deep in you. Your consciousness has to become a waterfall, to seek the deepest valley in your being – and you will find god there.</description>

Prem means love, mukul means mirror: a love mirror. And the message is that if one reflects rightly, if one becomes a mirror, one will not find anything else other than love. It is because of our distorting mind that we cannot see love, otherwise love is all around. From the trees and from the stars and from the sands and the sea and the pebbles, love is vibrating from everywhere.</description>

22 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF MIND IN RELIGION?
The mind is the most complex phenomenon in the whole of existence.
It will be a little difficult to understand the function of mind in religion. You will have to go through three doors.</description>

The third alternative: the whole man
25 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT TRIBES WHICH ARE NOT SEX-REPRESSIVE REMAIN POOR, AND SOCIETIES WHICH ARE SEX-REPRESSIVE BECOME RICH AND CREATIVE. OSHO, YOUR COMMUNES ARE NOT SEX-REPRESSIVE AND YET THEY ARE RICH AND CREATIVE. CAN YOU COMMENT?
It is one of the most sensitive areas of life because it is concerned with the very life force – sex.</description>

To become aware is to become desireless
24 January 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, and mahashunya means the great emptiness. Anand is the natural state of resting in oneself. It is not happiness – because it is not unhappiness. It is not part of the duality, the dual world – happy and unhappy, sound/silence, day/night, life/death. It is not part of duality; it is the non-dual state.</description>

If you have the desire, it always happens. The desire becomes the seed. That’s why one should be aware of wrong desires because they also happen. A desire is sowing a seed; then sooner or later it sprouts.</description>

Prem Maria. Prem means love; maria means rebellion. Love is the greatest rebellion because it is rebellion against the head, rebellion against logic, rebellion against all that is mundane.
Love means entering into the temple of the heart. One has to renounce the head. Love means entering into the world of paradox. One has to drop the whole logical structure of the mind.</description>

Okay.
I was quoting Bertrand Russell – this quotation will help like a nail. He said, “Sooner or later everybody will need psychoanalysis because it is so difficult to find anyone to listen to you, to be attentive to you.”
Attention is such a need that if the worst came to the worst one would even pay for it.</description>

[To a sannyasin leaving for the West.]
Continue to meditate. There are many temptations for dropping meditation, and they are not all from the outside; many are from the inside. The mind tends to be lethargic and it can always find good reasons, so don’t listen to the mind. Even if the reason seems to be perfectly right, be irrational but continue to meditate, because only those moments which have been used for meditation are the saved moments – all else is lost.</description>

Veet means beyond, chhitijo means horizon – beyond the horizon, beyond the horizontal. Life consists of two dimensions: one is horizontal, the other is vertical. Millions of people simply live in the horizontal – they crawl and creep, they remain asleep. That’s why in sleep you have to go to the horizontal position. It is easier to fall asleep in the horizontal position; if you are standing it is difficult to fall asleep.</description>

It is a name of shiva. The idea behind it is that the animal part in life has not to be rejected but to be absorbed. The animal part has not to be repressed, otherwise one loses vitality. If the animal part is condemned in any way, you become split, you become two, and then there is constant conflict within you, a constant inner war, and that war is a wastage of energies.</description>

This will be the name: Mahaprasthana – it means the great departure. Prasthana means departure and mahaprasthana means the great departure. It is a one hundred and eighty degree turn; you are never the same again. Even if you want to be the same, you cannot be, because once your vision has absorbed some meditative energy, your world changes.</description>

[Osho is explaining the name ‘Deva patra’ means divine worthiness, divine potential. He says man is a potentiality, not yet actualised. Man is like a seed that may or may not fall on the right soil, and it is only a possibility that he will grow, will bloom into flowers and will bear fruits]</description>

Deva means divine, bhadrena means grace. There are things which man can achieve by his own efforts and there are things which he can never achieve by his own efforts. The things that man cannot achieve by his own efforts are the really valuable things. The things that man can achieve will be lost sooner or later, death will take them away; they are momentary.</description>

Prem means love, vincent means victory – victory that comes through love, the victory that love is. Any other kind of victory is only apparent, only love gives you the real thing, because every other kind of victory is forced, violent; sooner or later there is going to be vengeance, revolt, reaction. Only love knows no revolt, because love is not an enforcement: it is a gift.</description>

The moment we try to possess it, we destroy it.</description>

Prem means love; persephone is Greek, it means goddess of spring – love, the goddess of spring. And it is only through love that spring comes into man’s life. Without love, life knows nothing of spring; without love, it is a long long wasteland. Weeds may grow but roses are impossible. Without love, life is a desert, and the oasis exists only in a dream.</description>

This will be your new name... and remember that the change of name is not only a change of name but the getting out of the old, dropping out of the old continuum. It is only symbolic but it carries much meaning in it. If it is just a change of name it is not significant – then all names are the same; whether you have one name or another will not make any difference.</description>

Learn to listen rather than talk; then you will enjoy people more. When you are with somebody, become a good listener. There is no need to say much, because in fact there is nothing to say.</description>

Stealing the truth
16 May 1986 pm in Punta Del Este, Uruguay
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN YOU WERE RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE WATCHER IS AMUSED, I FOUND I SLIPPED INTO THE SPACE OF A WITNESS WHILE LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES AND FELT A MEETING HAPPENED. IT WAS SUCH A CLEAR, COOL MEETING, AND IN COMPARISON I SAW HOW STICKY, CUMBERSOME AND CONFINING ARE ANY OF THE EMOTIONS I HAVE EVER FELT FOR YOU AND THROUGH WHICH I THOUGHT I COULD MEET YOU.</description>

The bell always tolls for somebody else
26 March 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I KNOW IT IS CERTAIN THAT ONE DAY I AM GOING TO DIE, BUT I DON’T FEEL ANY FEAR – WHY?
It is not something exceptional, it is almost the rule. Nobody is afraid of death; otherwise living will become impossible. There is a natural safety measure, and that is something of a very basic nature to be understood.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
PLEASE COULD YOU TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INNOCENCE AND STUPIDITY?
Innocence is the ultimate flowering of your consciousness. Even a child is not innocent; he is simply ignorant. He does not know, but he is not aware that he knows not. The child most probably will become stupid, because the society needs stupid people, the religions need stupid people, the politicians need stupid people.</description>

Truth’s not a theory but a flower
28 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, blissful, and sanjaya means right victory – blissful right victory. Victory becomes wrong when it is enforced, when it is through violence, through aggression. When the other has to be defeated then the victory is wrong; it is ugly. When you don’t enforce it and the other simply surrenders to you it is right victory.</description>

JANOV SAYS THAT NEGATIVITY IS ELECTROCHEMICALLY DRIVEN BY ENDOMORPHINS, THE CHEMICAL EFFECT OF PAIN. HOW IS “YES” POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXHAUSTIVE PRIMAL THERAPY?
Primal therapy has contributed something very essential and significant to human growth. But just as other therapies in the West are amateurish, primal therapy also belongs to the same category.</description>

It means ‘only consciousness’. Nothing else exists but consciousness, and all else that appears to exist is only appearance.
Just one hundred years ago Friedrich Nietzsche declared ‘God is dead.’ Those were the days of great enthusiasm for materialists. Science was evolving, exploding, and man was full of great hope that now he had come to the solution of all problems, god was no more needed, man had come of age.</description>

[Osho gives a three-year-old girl sannyas. The mother says her daughter wants to ask Osho about dying. She wants Osho to tell her where everything goes when it dies.]
That’s very good.All children are interested in death; it is one of the natural curiosities. But rather
than answering them – because all answers will be false.</description>

I told you to remain celibate for a few days specifically for this purpose, because once you are celibate for a few days, energy pools; it becomes a reservoir.</description>

Anand Annette. Anand means bliss, annette means mercy, compassion. It comes from the Hebrew, hannah; from hannah it became anna and from anna, annette.
Compassion comes as a shadow of bliss. It is a by-product; one cannot cultivate it. There is no way to go to it directly; it comes via blissfulness. If one is blissful, one is compassionate.</description>

Let joy be your discipline... and a discipline is a discipline only when it is out of joy. If it is forced and you are not joyously in it then it is a self-imposed slavery, it is not discipline. You are torturing yourself, you are a kind of masochist – you enjoy self-torture.</description>

Prem means love, regis means wise. Love brings wisdom. Wisdom is the shadow of love; without love there is no wisdom. Without love knowledge is possible, much knowledge is possible, but wisdom impossible. Wisdom is the function of the heart, and without love the heart remains dormant. It is the force of love that moves the dynamo of the heart and once the heart is stirred, the seed of wisdom that we are carrying within us starts growing.</description>

It is in the stars, it is in the flowers, it is in men and women, it is in animals, birds; and those who know say that it is even in a rock.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
OFTEN, WHEN I LOOK AT THE SUNSET, SADNESS ARISES FROM DEEP WITHIN. IT FEELS AS IF THE SUN IS MY HOME – THE PLACE I WILL RETURN TO WHEN “THE WORK” IS DONE. BUT NOW I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH “THE WORK,” THIS EARTH, THIS EXISTENCE, THESE PEOPLE.</description>

24 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING TO US ABOUT BLISS?
I have been blissed out myself for almost thirty-three years. That is exactly the time Jesus lived on earth. Shankara also lived only thirty-three years, Vivekananda too. For the length of the whole life of Jesus I have been blissed out.</description>

OUr destiny is to have wings, to fly
26 January 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means blissful, and sadhu means simplicity; blissful simplicity. And these two things are to be remembered – be blissful and be simple. Only a complicated mind is lost – a simple mind is never lost. A simple mind is always at home – and you have that simple mind.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
OSCAR WILDE ONCE SAID: “WHEN THE GODS WANT TO PUNISH US, THEY ANSWER OUR PRAYERS.” WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
Devageet, Oscar Wilde is right. It often happens that what psychologists cannot explain about the human mind, the creative artist, the poet, can easily explore to the depths which are beyond logic, beyond reason, beyond scientific research.</description>

Prem means love, adima means primal. The cultured love is no more love; only the wild is true. The sophisticated is already dead; it breathes not. The civilised is so repressed, so managed, so formal, that it can’t be alive. Love is alive when it is primal. And if love is not alive, you are not alive.</description>

SWITZERLAND IS A RICH AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING FOR MANY REASONS, AND THEY EVEN ENJOY THIS. WHY CAN’T THEY USE THEIR FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY TO BE HAPPY?
Humanity can be divided into two parts: the first is sadist, the second is masochist. The sadist enjoys torturing others; the masochist enjoys torturing himself.</description>

Prem means love and upassana means worship. This should be your attitude – of a deep, loving worship, of a worshipful love. The attitude of worship is something which has to be felt. Ordinarily it has disappeared from the world. People have completely forgotten what worship really means.
It is an approach towards reality with a child’s heart – not calculating, not cunning, not analysing, but full of awe, of a tremendous feeling of wonder, a feeling of mystery surrounding you.</description>

And love is the only sweetness; everything else is bitter. We can even tolerate bitter things if there is a little mixture of love in them; otherwise life becomes unbearable.

Okay. Do you see the synchronicity? Simultaneously, I and Devageet said, “Okay.” Of course he said it for one thing, I for something else; but the lines cross.
The moment before I came in I was listening to one of the greatest flutists, Hari Prasad. It stirred many memories in me.
There are many types of flute in the world.</description>

27 September 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Veet means beyond, prabhavo means impressions, influences, conditionings – beyond all impressions, beyond all influences, beyond all conditionings. That is where truth is. That’s why the mind cannot know it, because the mind consists only of conditionings. Whatsoever has been taught, whatsoever has been put inside you from the outside is your mind. It is a deep effort, a cunning effort of the society to control you from within.</description>

[An Indian sannyasin had come before darshan to talk to Osho about a frightening experience he had had recently while meditating. As people arrived for the darshan Osho was saying:]
... one gets really scared. Really, it came too early and you weren’t yet ready. It can happen that suddenly a key fits, and then the experience of deep meditation is exactly like death.</description>

Man is a bridge, a bridge between the animal and God, a bridge between two infinities – matter and consciousness. Man is not a being but a bridge.
A being is complete; man is not complete. Man has to become bridged, man has to go a long way yet. Man is only a passage to be passed over, to be surpassed.</description>

27 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, Arpana means surrender – divine surrender. There is a surrender which one can manage; that is a human surrender. It is surrender only for the name’s sake because the door remains the human mind and anything that is done by the human mind cannot be surrender. Deeply hidden behind, the controller is still existing and if at any moment the mind decides it wants to, the surrender will disappear, it can be taken back.</description>

Anand Nimus. Anand means bliss. Bliss does not mean happiness; it is something totally different. It is not only quantitatively different, it is qualitatively different. Happiness always has unhappiness as the other side of it, as a shadow to it. It is never alone. Even when you are happy you know that unhappiness is just close by.</description>

Deva means divine; the word ‘divine’ comes from the same root as ‘deva.’ Basir is a sufi name for God – it means: all seeing. Your full name will mean: a divine way of seeing. Ordinarily what we see may not be there. It may be just our minds projecting something from the within. We see what we believe; our belief creates our vision.</description>

Soma means the moon, and deva means god – moon god. It is one of the most pregnant symbols. The moon represents the feminine energy, just as the sun represents the masculine energy. Masculine energy is out-going; feminine energy is in-going. It is like inhalation; masculine is like exhalation. Inhalation is life, exhalation is death.</description>

If it is something that you can’t share then you have imagined it, it is not true. Truth is always something that has to be shared, that can always be shared.</description>

Deva means divine and pankaj means lotus – a divine lotus. The lotus is very symbolic in the East because it comes out of dirty mud, and yet so beautiful, so graceful, so other-worldly... is born of the earth but does not belong to the earth. It is unearthly.
So one has to be like a lotus – rooted in the earth but not defined and confined by the earth.</description>

Deva Genevieve. Deva means divine; genevieve means a white wave.
The wave can exist in two waysOne: thinking of itself as separate from the ocean; the other: just
as an organic part of the whole. The first is the way of the ego and the second is the way of the sannyasin.
The sannyasin has to imbibe the spirit of being one with the whole, just a wave of the ocean.</description>

Deva means divine, kranto means revolution – divine revolution. The political revolution, the social revolution, the economic revolution, are not really revolutions. They are only reforms, modifications, rearrangements, but nothing new ever happens through them. They remain continuous with the past. To call them revolution is not right.
The first requirement for a revolution is that it should be discontinuous with the past.</description>

30 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho initiates someone, telling her to imagine she is a waterfall. He then tells her that it is very difficult for her to imagine, so imagination cannot be of any help to her]
Imagination, if available, is great energy; it can transform you. But if you are not available then there is no need to go in that direction.</description>

Everybody is carrying a sun within him
30 July 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Anand suriya. Anand means bliss, suriya, the source of light: the sun, blissful source of light... ]
And everybody is carrying a sun within him. If we are living in darkness it is not because we don’t have light; it is because we never look at the light.</description>

‌without any fear, the master&#39;s fire can burn all your rubbish, and your own fire can start being the way it has to be.
Once you have known your own fire, your own light, your own flowering, life is such a contentment. Only one thing remains after that, and that is a constant gratefulness, a gratitude. I call it the only prayer. It has no words, but just a feeling towards existence of deep gratitude.</description>

27 August 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A mother with her child says she feels resistance and indecision.]
It is on the right track. It is how trust arises. Trust arises out of the dark night of doubt. One has to go deep into doubt to find trust. Trust is not something that you can find by dropping the doubt.</description>

Philosophers all over the world have been arguing for centuries about what basic stuff the universe is made of, what the substance is. There have been propositions, systems, that say that matter is the basic reality and mind is just an outgrowth, that matter is basic and mind is just a by-product, that mind is also material, only subtle.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS? ISN’T RELIGION SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY NEEDED BY MAN?
Yes, I am against all the religions, because I am for religion.
The very fact that there are so many religions is enough to prove that something is basically wrong, that we have not been able to discover the truth about religion, because the truth can only be one – lies can be hundreds.</description>

Nothing else but courage is needed, and everything will happen on its own accord. We go on missing many things in life just because we lack courage. In fact, no effort is needed to achieve – just courage – and things start coming to you rather than you going to them.</description>

Prem means love, kavina means poet. Poetry is the way to god – not logic, not mathematics, but poetry. The vagueness of poetry, the mystery of poetry, opens the door. To have poetic eyes is to have a religious vision. All those who have attained were poets. Whether they wrote poetry ever or not is immaterial, but the way they looked at life was the way of poetry – aesthetics, sensitivity, love.</description>

[A sannyasin who is leaving says: It’s like a step into the unknown, to go back. I don’t know what’s happening and I don’t know how I’m going to live anymore.]
Yes, it is... it is. You will be back soon. Once you have lived with me you cannot live anywhere else. Sooner or later every sannyasin has to come to me and be here forever.</description>

[A sannyasin says his wife, a non-sannyasin, wants to study psychology.] Where can she study psychology better than here? Just tell her!...
Anywhere else you can study psychology as a dead subject – here it is alive. Here people are opening up, growing, and that’s what psychology basically is: the science of the soul.
The western psychology is yet not worthy enough of being called psychology.</description>

Anand Phillip. Anand means bliss, and Phillip is the name of one of the disciples of Jesus, one of the twelve apostles – a blissful disciple.
One can become a disciple only through blissfulness. Disciplehood is not born out of sadness. It is the most cheerful phenomenon possible because it is love in is highest form.</description>

Anand means bliss and haramita is a japanese form of a sanskrit word, ‘paramita’. ‘Paramita’ means going to the other shore. The unknown is the other shore, god is the other shore. The visible is this shore; the invisible is the other shore. So the whole search is for the other shore. This shore is not satisfying – it only creates more and more desires and more and more frustrations; it is utterly futile.</description>

[To a sannyasin who is leaving]
... continue to meditate there and come back as soon as possible, because much work has to be done yet. Something has started but it is just a beginning – never forget that. And never be satisfied too soon. Sometimes it happens that we become satisfied too early. As far as worldly things are concerned, never be dissatisfied, and as far as the inner world is concerned, never be satisfied.</description>

Anand Brigitta. Anand means bliss; brigitta means bridge.
Bliss is the bridge to God. To be blissful is to be prayerful. To be blissful is to be religious, although just the contrary is the prevalent idea: religious people look very sad, they go on carrying long faces, they are haughty, egoistic. You can look in their eyes and you can see the holier-than-thou look.</description>

Death never happens
26 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
A MAN LIKE YOU COMES ALONG ONCE IN ETERNITY. WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND SAYING IS UNIQUE. I’M INDEED FORTUNATE TO BE HERE AND I MAY NEVER HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. YET EVERY MORNING I COME TO DISCOURSE, I FALL ASLEEP. AM I MISSING? SHOULD I ALSO GO AND JUMP IN KRISHNAMURTI LAKE?</description>

DO POLITICIANS HAVE BRAINS?
I am sorry, but I doubt it. If one has brains there are so many beautiful things in life to do; it is impossible for such a man to be interested in politics at all. Politics is for the lowest category of intellect.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE TRANSCENDENTAL?
Deva Paro, the moment you start witnessing yourself, you will see three layers of existence within you. One is the outermost; anybody can observe it; it is objective; it is material; it is your body.
The second layer behind it is your mind, your thoughts, your dreams, your expectations.</description>

Prem means love, lolita means moved by, swayed by, possessed by, swinging, rocking: rocking and swinging in love. And let that become your very life-style. Remain in movement, remain in a kind of dance, and be swayed by the small things of life. They are not small! If we can be swayed by them, they are all extraordinary.</description>

WHAT CAN WE DO FROM OUR SIDE TO SURRENDER THE EGO, WHEN THIS WANTING TO SURRENDER IT IS, IN ITSELF, AN INTRINSIC PART?
Latifa, the ego is a puzzle. It is something like darkness – which you can see, which you can feel, which can obstruct your way but which does not exist.</description>

[Osho suggests groups to a newly arrived sannyasin, who replies that he has been running groups himself in London. Osho stresses the importance of his putting aside all his knowledge, for it is a barrier. When people become knowledgeable they lose the childlike quality of innocence and the ability to wonder, to be surprised.</description>

‌CHAPTER 29
30 July 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, mimanso means enquiry into truth. The full name will mean: loving enquiry into truth... and only a loving enquiry succeeds. One can enquire into truth without love; then one is doomed to fail, there is no possibility of success. Love has to be a necessary ingredient in the enquiry. Without love the enquiry remains lopsided: it remains only logic, arithmetic, science, objective.</description>

Deva means god or divine and pashianti means clarity, vision. capacity to see. Capacity to clearly see god – that will be the meaning of the whole name.
Everybody is born capable; somewhere on the way we lose the capacity. Every child comes with a very clear vision of god, but by and by we force him to forget; we force him to remember the world and forget god.</description>

The whole night the wind went on blowing in the trees. The sound was so beautiful that I played Pannalal Ghosh, one of the flutists that Pagal Baba had introduced to me. Just now too, I was playing his music, but he has a way of his own. His introduction is very long, so before Gudia called me it was still only the introduction.</description>

Love has to grow through misunderstanding. Understanding is not easy – it is very rare to arrive at understanding; because you are confused, he is confused, you don’t know who you are, he does not know who he is.</description>

Anand means bliss; Pujan means worship. Bliss is worship. To be blissful is to be prayerful. To have the capacity to celebrate life is religiousness.
But down the ages the so-called religions have done Just the opposite: they have made religion a very serious, somber affair. They have made it almost pathological, morbid. They have made it utterly negative: life denying, love denying, bliss-denying.</description>

The very idea ‘I am’ is the root cause of bondage, so there is no way to go beyond the ‘I’, through the ‘I’; it won’t allow. It will go on surrounding you in new ways, in new forms.</description>

Prem sandurga – love context.
Man is the opportunity for love to happen, the occasion for love to happen, the context. And if love does not happen, the opportunity is lost. Then you didn’t use it rightly; you were not creative in it.
Love is the flower of human consciousness. A tree is unfulfilled if it doesn’t come to fruition and flower.</description>

Deva means divine and dhyana means the state of meditation – divine state of meditation. The word ‘meditation’ is not as adequate as dhyana, because nothing like dhyana has ever existed in the West so no western language has any appropriate word for it. Meditation comes closest but still misses the target. Meditation means contemplation, to think about, and dhyana means not thinking at all, just being.</description>

Prem means love, sahaja means spontaneous. Love is true only when it is spontaneous, unplanned, unpracticed, uncultivated, unthought. Whenever you plan for love, whenever deliberateness enters into it it becomes phony and false. And that’s why people go on loving yet it never satisfies, because no phony food can be nourishing.
True love has to be spontaneous, it has to happen without any preparation preceding it.</description>

Mysticism, the forgotten language
16 September 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND ME?
Existence is always a mystery.
People fall in love; they cannot answer why, how they have found each other. And when they fall in love there is an absolute feeling that they are made for each other – but how did they manage to find each other in such a big world?</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ONE OF THE GREAT IRONIES OF OUR RECENT EXPERIENCES OF SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES IS SEEN IN RELATION TO THE IDEA CONTAINED IN THE STORY OF JOSEPH, AND MARY, WHO IS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO JESUS, FINDING “NO ROOM AT THE INN.”
THIS STORY IS USED AS A BASE FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIAN TENET OF “CHARITY,” AND TO “LOVE THY NEIGHBOR.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THERE IS A REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN NIETZSCHE ALL OVER EUROPE, FROM BOTH THE PRE-AND POST-WAR GENERATIONS. NIETZSCHE’S APPEAL SEEMS TO LIE IN HIS VIEWS STILL BEING CONTEMPORARY.
COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
It is good news.
Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the philosophers with the most potential in the whole world, not only in the West, not only in Germany.</description>

IT’S NOT GRIPPING ME, IT’S EMBRACING ME, AND EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AROUND ME. I DON’T KNOW IF THEY CAN FEEL IT, BUT I CAN.

It is a mythological metaphor. The ordinary swan can stay in any lake but the royal swan only stays at the purest lake in the himalayas; the lake is called mansorovhar. In the hindu mythology it is the purest lake in the world and it is the most beautiful.</description>

HOW DO YOU EXPERIENCE YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT?
Milarepa, enlightenment is not an experience.
Experience always divides the experiencer from itself. But enlightenment knows no duality; hence it is not an experience but simply experiencing. It may not be right language; in fact, it cannot be right language because the linguist will not understand what you mean by ‘experiencing’.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
31 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS INITIATION ACCORDING TO YOU?
THE search for truth is as old as man himself. But there are many kinds of seekers.
The first category I call the curious.
They are the most superficial. They are not read to do anything, sacrifice anything, make any effort. Their curiosity is just like a child’s curiosity – he goes on asking about everything.</description>

[A sannyasin about his responsibilities as a father as he would be separating from his wife. His wife and he had arranged that the three boys would live with him, while the girl would live with her mother.]
Much will have to be done, because when the mother is not there, your responsibilities become greater, bigger.</description>

Again and again the miracle of the morning... the sun and the trees. The world is just like a snow flower: take it in your hand and it melts away. Nothing is left, just a wet hand. But if you see, just see, then a snow flower is as beautiful as any flower in the world.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
14 October 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine and dheeraj means patience – divine patience. And that is very significant to remember. On the path nothing more is needed than patience. Man can do everything that he is capable of, but still there is no necessity that the ultimate happens; it may happen, it may not. We can grope in the dark; the door may open, it may not So if one has not infinite patience, one starts getting tired of the search.</description>

It is not an easy job.…
But now it is too late! Every woman wants to become a mother without knowing the responsibilities. It is a long commitment. And remember: never think of what is right and what is wrong.</description>

[The first sannyasin Osho addressed had sent him a letter earlier saying that she was in a deep loving relationship with her husband, but at the same time she felt attracted to someone else.]
Two things to remember. The first: love grows only in deep intimacy and trust. If you change persons, from A to B, from B to C, it is as if you are transplanting your being from one place to another.</description>

Prem means love, Laurel is a symbol of two things; one is victory, the other is immortality. Love brings both: it brings victory, it brings immortality. Love is the only experience in which defeat is impossible because the very first requirement of being in love is to be surrendered. If a person is surrendered how can he be defeated?</description>

Become a declaration of bliss. Don’t hide It – manifest it as much as you can. The more you manifest bliss, the more it will be coming to you. Remember a very basic law: that if bliss is expressed, shared, it grows.</description>

[NOTE: This was published in THE RAJNEESH TIMES, 19th August 1983 while Osho was in silence.]
INTERVIEW WITH KIRK BRAUN
Q: WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF RAJNEESHISM?
Osho: Rajneeshism is not a religion like Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, etc. The name should not be misunderstood. It simply shows a poverty of language – to be exactly true, Rajneeshism is a religionless religion.</description>

Deva Ageho. Deva means divine; Ageho means homelessness.
Life has no security; it thrives in danger. It has no safety; it is possible only in danger. Death is safe and secure; life is a risk. Hence those who really want to live have to take many risks. They have to go on moving into the unknown.</description>

His ears hear not but only translate. His eyes don’t see but impose. His mind does not understand but only interprets. His whole life is phoney.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
3 January 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, garima means glory, splendour, grandeur. Love is the only glorious phenomenon on the earth. It is only through love that we become aware of god. Those who miss love are bound to miss god, because there is no other way to become aware of the presence of the divine except through love.</description>

OSHO, YOU SAY: GO BEYOND THE MIND. DO NOT LISTEN TO ITS CHATTER. DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING REPRESSED? ALSO, WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID NOT TO GET HOOKED ON YOU.</description>

AN EARTHQUAKE IS HAPPENING: MY ANCIENT CRUST IS CRACKING AND MARVELOUS SQUIRTS OF BLISS ARE POURING OUT. MORE AND MORE, YOUR WORDS ARE INCREDIBLY ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OF MY INNER WORLD, NOT JUST BEAUTIFUL IMAGES OF SOMEWHERE ELSE.

WHAT IS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MORE FAMILIAR SYSTEMS OF YOGA AND THE SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE DEVELOPED?
There are as many paths as there are minds. Each mind requires a particular path and each method is true for a particular person. No method is true as such or false as such. It depends on the person to whom it is to be applied.</description>

Desirelessness: An Opening to the Unknown
17 February 1972 pm in Bombay, India
SARVA KARMA NIRAAKARANAM AAWAHANAM
CESSATION OF THE CAUSE OF ALL ACTIONS IS AAWAHANAM – THE INVOCATION.
RELIGION is not ritual. Really, when a religion dies it becomes ritual: the dead body of a religion becomes the ritual. But everywhere ritual is to be found. If you go to find religion, you will find ritual.</description>

The first question Question 1
OSHO, EVERYTHING SEEMS SO UNREAL, LIKE A DREAM. TO ME, YOU SEEM TO BE SO UNREAL, FLOATING IN AND OUT OF DISCOURSE EACH DAY. I DO FEEL SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE HAPPENING IN YOUR PRESENCE, AND MORE EACH MOMENT BEING HERE WITH YOU, BUT I CANNOT SEEM TO FEEL A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I FEEL LIKE MY MIND IS GOING CRAZY THESE DAYS. IT IS AS IF IT IS TRYING TO GRASP ANYTHING IT POSSIBLY CAN, ESPECIALLY DURING DISCOURSE AS I SIT IN SILENCE WITH YOU. IT FEELS LIKE IT’S HAVING LESS AND LESS TO HOLD ON TO, LESS AND LESS TO THINK ABOUT, SO IT’S CREATING THE CRAZIEST THINGS.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I SEE YOU HERE EVERY DAY, SO RADIANT, SO FULL OF LIGHT, SO FAR AWAY FROM THE EVERYDAY REALITY OF MY LIFE. YOU ARE A SHINING BEACON SHOWING THE WAY, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING MORE THAT CAN HAPPEN IN ME.

The first question Question 1
OSHO, THANK YOU FOR THE DELICATE SYNTHESIS. GREAT JOY ARISES IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF EXISTENCE.
Deva Nirguna,
TRUTH ALWAYS TRIGGERS A PROCESS IN YOU, even if the truth is not your own. The very hearing of it creates a parallel process in you. It is not caused by hearing it; it follows not the law of cause and effect but the law of synchronicity.</description>

HERE IS THE SPHERE OF CHANGE, CHANGE, CHANGE. THROUGH CHANGE CONSUME CHANGE.
Northrope says somewhere that the Western mind has been continuously searching for the theoretical component of existence – the causal link for how things happen, what is the cause, how the effect can be controlled, how man can manipulate nature.</description>

THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE MIND ARE FIVE. THEY CAN BE EITHER A SOURCE OF ANGUISH OR OF NON-ANGUISH.
THEY ARE RIGHT KNOWLEDGE, WRONG KNOWLEDGE, IMAGINATION, SLEEP AND MEMORY.
Mind can be either the source of bondage or the source of freedom. Mind becomes the gate for this world, the entry; it can also become the exit.</description>

THERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS SO DISTURBED BY THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN SHADOW AND SO DISPLEASED WITH HIS OWN FOOTSTEPS, THAT HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF BOTH.
THE METHOD HE HIT UPON WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM THEM. SO HE GOT UP AND RAN.
BUT EVERY TIME HE PUT HIS FOOT DOWN THERE WAS ANOTHER STEP, WHILE HIS SHADOW KEPT UP WITH HIM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY.</description>

From Belief Towards Truth

Friends have asked many questions. One friend asks: “You say that Truth is not obtained from words, much less from scriptures and from gurus, then what is the purport of your talk?”
Truth will not be obtained from my talk – please understand this well. Nobody’s words can convey Truth. If a thorn gets embedded in your foot, you can use a second thorn to remove it; but once the thorn is out both become equally redundant.</description>

WHAT IS THE SECRET OF REMAINING HAPPY AND MARRIED? SARJAN,
It is impossible! It has never happened – it cannot happen in the very nature of things. Marriage is something against nature. Marriage is an imposition, an invention of man – certainly out of necessity, but now even that necessity is out of date.</description>

Into the disinterested depths of Tao
21 June 1971 pm in Immortal Study Circle CHAPTER 1: SUTRA 3 THEREFORE:
ALWAYS STRIPPED OF PASSION WE MUST BE FOUND
IF LIFE’S SECRET WE WOULD SOUND; BUT IF PASSION ALWAYS WITHIN US BE,
ITS OUTER FRINGE IS ALL THAT WE SHALL SEE.
The path that can be trodden upon, is not the Path. The Truth that can be investigated, is not the Truth.</description>

TO BE TATTERED IS TO BE RENEWED. TO BE IN WANT IS TO POSSESS.
TO HAVE PLENTY IS TO BE CONFUSED. THEREFORE THE SAGE EMBRACES THE ONE, AND BECOMES THE MODEL OF THE WORLD.</description>

Please sit or stand apart. Keep a little distance from one an other so that those of you who want to lie down may do so comfortably. No one will talk, there will be no chit chatting at all.
You will sit quietly and no one will sit close to another. There is plenty of space here, so don’t be miserly.</description>

WHAT IS THE AIM OF RELIGION? It is to awaken the slumbering superman in the ordinary man. This and this alone is religion’s goal.
YOU ASK FOR PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD? Isn’t the existence of consciousness sufficient proof? Doesn’t a drop of water prove there is an ocean?

THE CESSATION OF THIS EGO IS WHAT IS CALLED FREEDOM.

No. The knowledge of science is incomplete. It is as if there were light all over the world while in your own house there was darkness. With such imperfect knowledge, without the knowledge of one’s self, life simply turns into misery. For life to be crowned with peace, contentment and fulfillment, it is not enough to know material things alone.</description>

WHY IS CHILDLIKENESS COMPARED TO MEDITATION?
Garimo, when a man is reborn, only then he understands the beauty and the grandeur of childhood. The child is ignorant; hence he is unable to understand the tremendous innocence that surrounds him. Once a child becomes aware of his own innocence, there is no difference between the child and the sage.</description>

To wait, to wait for nothing
2 April 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
TANKA ASKED CHORO, “WHAT IS THE SELF BEFORE THE EMPTY EON?”
AS CHORO WAS ABOUT TO ANSWER, TANKA SAID, “YOU’RE STILL NOISY – GO AWAY FOR NOW.”
ONE DAY, AS CHORO WAS CLIMBING BOL PEAK, HIS MIND OPENED UP INTO ENLIGHTENMENT. HE TOOK A SHORTCUT DOWN AND WENT BACK TO STAND BY TANKA, WHO SLAPPED HIM AND SAID, “I THOUGHT YOU KNEW IT EXISTS.</description>

3 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
SUCCESS IS NEAREST TO THOSE WHOSE EFFORTS ARE INTENSE AND SINCERE. THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS VARY ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF EFFORT. SUCCESS IS ALSO ATTAINED BY THOSE WHO SURRENDER TO GOD.
GOD IS THE SUPREME RULER. HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL UNIT OF DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS. HE IS UNTOUCHED BY THE AFFLICTIONS OF LIFE, ACTION AND ITS RESULT.</description>

THE VOID HAVING VANISHED INTO NOTHINGNESS, HE REALIZES THAT THE NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING, AND WHEN THE NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED, THERE IS MOST TRULY TO BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.</description>

IS THE PRACTICING OF TRADITIONAL ASANAS HELPFUL FOR MEDITATION?
Man’s personality is neither solely physical nor solely mental but both simultaneously. Rather, it would be correct to say that it is psychosomatic. There is no gap between the two, so anything that happens on the physical plane vibrates on the mental plane and vice versa.</description>

It is not only that love transcends those things but finally love transcends itself too. Only then does it arrive, because unless love transcends love itself, it remains mingled with hatred. It remains poisoned with anger, possessiveness; it carries the colour of violence.</description>

30 October 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, svado means taste. God is a taste... a taste on the tongue.
God is not a hypothesis to explain anything; it is something very existential. And the proof of god is not in any argument – it is exactly in tasting it. And the taste is such that even those who have tasted cannot express it.</description>

[A sannyasin who is leaving says she has been feeling very open towards Osho but says that just now, as she is leaving, she feels closed and is sad that she is leaving feeling like this. Osho reassures her that her heart is open.]
That happens many times, because the heart and the mind have become almost disconnected, so whatsoever happens in the heart, the mind does not take note of it, it neglects it.</description>

31 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Darpana means a mirror. Thinking is a barrier: mirroring is the way. To think is to miss: to reflect is to get. Truth has not to be invented but only discovered. And the veil is not on truth; it is on our mirror. Truth is utterly naked, it is not covered. So when I say ‘It has to be discovered’ I mean that we have to open up to it.</description>

It is fearful and it is painful, and one has to suffer it. Nothing should be done to avoid it, nothing should be done to divert the mind, nothing should be done to escape form it.</description>

Gyan Raga, the mind creates questions. They may look very relevant and rational, but they are against experience, against existence. And because the whole world is communicating with each other only through the mind, nobody raises his voice against such questions, that they are basically wrong.</description>

DOES A PAGAN LIVING A NATURAL LIFE NEED RELIGION?
It is one of the most basic questions that can be asked. The first thing to understand is, who is a pagan? It is not what Christians go on calling a pagan. The pagan is a natural man – sincere, not a hypocrite, living life naturally without an domination of the mind.</description>

Anand means bliss, and sangeetam means music: bliss music. They have something in common. Bliss is a music – can be expressed only by music – and music has a blissfulness in it. Hence whenever somebody is lost in music, a glimpse of bliss, like a whip, comes into one’s being.</description>

Anil Bharti, the question that you have asked is really complex. A married man certainly can be a rebel, in fact he has all the reasons to be a rebel. An unmarried man may not even think of rebellion, he may be thinking of getting married; but the married man cannot think of anything else except rebellion, although he only thinks of it.</description>

IN THE FACE OF THE HUGE MYSTERY OF LIFE, SINCE THE EARLY AGES HUMANKIND HAS CONSULTED ORACLES. IT’S VERY FAMOUS THROUGHOUT HISTORY – LIKE THE ORACLE OF DELPHI. PEOPLE ASKED THE ADVICE OF THE STARS TO KNOW ABOUT HUMAN DESTINY; WITCHES OR WISE WOMEN USED TO READ DESTINY IN THE TEA LEAVES OR EVEN IN TORTOISE SHELLS.</description>

Truth: beyond mind, beyond language
25 February 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS YOUR CONCEPT ABOUT GOD?
Rahul, before I answer your question, I would like to say something about you. Unless something is said about you, the question will not have a proper context. You belong to the Krishnamurti Foundation of India.
In the first place, his whole life Krishnamurti tried to say that nobody should be his follower, that there should be no doctrine in his name, that there should be no organization around him, that he is not teaching you some belief system, but only sharing his experience.</description>

NOW, SINCE YOU HAVE OFFERED US THE GIFT OF BEING A FRIEND, I OFTEN ALLOW MYSELF TO FEEL AND LOVE YOU IN A SIMILAR WAY AS I FEEL AND LOVE THIS FRIEND.</description>

Even if people are seeking God, they are seeking in order to find bliss. If by finding God you find a state of misery, you will not seek God. Hence God is not really the goal of the search but only a means to attain bliss.</description>

Prem means love; Helmut means great courage. Love is the greatest courage in life.
It really needs guts to be in love. It needs a capacity to die into the love, to disappear into love. It needs courage because the ego has to be surrendered. Hence many people would like to love and be loved, but cannot dare.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY DOES EVERYBODY WANT TO PROVE AND TO ASSERT? WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND PROVING AND ASSERTING ONESELF?
PLEASE EXPLAIN.
The psychology behind assertiveness, behind proving oneself, is very simple. Every child, from his very beginning, is told that he is not what he should be. Disciplines are given, commandments are given; he has to fulfill them.</description>

Dharma means the ultimate law, tao, or what Christians and Jews call god.

YOU SAID THAT LOVE IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH DEATH. THEN WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN BUDDHA’S LOVE.
For an ignorant person love is always part of hate, it always goes with hate. For the ignorant mind hate and love are just two aspects of the same coin.</description>

I AM THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SHAKTI (ENERGY), I AM WITHOUT HANDS AND FEET.
I CAN SEE WITHOUT EYES, HEAR WITHOUT EARS, KNOW WITHOUT INTELLECT.
DEVOID OF ALL FORMS, I KNOW ALL; BUT THERE IS NONE WHO KNOWS ME,THE EVER PURE CONSCIOUSNESS.
This has been one of the most foundational questions for a religious seeker: whether the divine can be known, whether the divine can become an object, whether the divine can be encountered, whether I can meet him.</description>

Prayer without meditation remains part of the imagination. You create a kind of hallucination around yourself. You don’t know what God is but you start having a dialogue with him. This dialogue is not really a dialogue, it is a monologue you are talking to yourself. It is a kind of religious neurosis – it is not true prayer.</description>

Okay.
The other day I told you about Masto’s disappearance. I think he is still alive. In fact I know he is. In the East, this has been one of the most ancient ways, to disappear in the Himalayas before you die. To die in that beautiful part is richer than to live anywhere else; even dying there has something of the eternal.</description>

THE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME FOR AN ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.
BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.
Many people seem to be interested in meditation, but that interest cannot be very deep because so very few are transformed through it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 34
4 September 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Dhyan Annette. Dhyan means meditation, a state of no-mind, a state of no-thought... just a pure sky of your consciousness, with no clouds of emotions, thoughts, memories, imagination, dreams. All clouds have gone, the sky is utterly empty. That is the state of dhyan, meditation. And Annette means mercy.
Out of this state of no-mind, mercy flows, compassion arises.</description>

This morning I said a very abrupt goodbye to Masto, and I felt it the whole day. It simply cannot be done, at least in his case. It reminds me of when I was going to college and leaving my Nani after being so long together.
Since my grandfather died and left her there had been no one in her life except me.</description>

BEGIN.…
Before I take your questions some other points have to be clarified, because those points will help you understand more what tantra means. Tantra is not a moral concept. It is neither moral nor immoral. It is amoral. It is a science, and science is neither. Your moralities and concepts concerning moral behavior are irrelevant for tantra.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ABANDON THEIR INTELLIGENCE, THEIR SENSITIVITY, THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THEIR INDIVIDUALITY WHEN THEY BECOME PART OF A GROUP? MUST THE REBELLIOUS SPIRIT ALWAYS BE ALONE?
Dhyan Senshi, the rebellious spirit is basically the experience of one’s own individuality, absolutely free from any kind of psychological slavery.</description>

[God is everywhere, except in the temple, Osho explains.]
Bliss is the only experience that gives you a taste of God. For a moment it transports you into another world where you are worldly no more; for a moment you are human no more, you are divine. The moment of bliss is the moment of God penetrating you and of you penetrating God; it is an orgasmic experience with God.</description>

I have heard Ravi Shankar play on the sitar. He has everything one can imagine: the personality of a singer, the mastery of his instrument, and the gift of innovation, which is rare in classical musicians. He is immensely interested in the new. He has played with Yehudi Menuhin. No other Indian sitar player would be ready to do it because no such thing has ever happened before.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DO WE NEED SPECIAL MEDITATIONS FOR WOMEN?
No. Meditation is concerned with your consciousness – and consciousness is neither man nor woman. This is one of the fundamentals I want the world to be aware of.
All the religions have denied the woman any possibility for spiritual growth, thinking that her body is different, her biology is different: she will not be able to reach to the ultimate flowering of consciousness.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN INDIA THERE IS A PROVERB, “VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM: THE WHOLE EARTH IS A FAMILY”. PERHAPS THIS PROVERB IS ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD. OSHO, WERE THERE REALLY PEOPLE ONCE WHO LIVED LIKE A FAMILY? OR WAS IT A VISION OF SOME MYSTIC, A VISION WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO BRING TO REALITY?</description>

[Anand means bliss Osho tells him, and manuel means God is with us.]
That’s the very foundation of being blissful, that God is with us. Without God we are lonely, without God existence is empty; without God there can be no meaning, no significance. We can be blissful because God is. And God is always with us.</description>

Just now I was thinking of a story. I don’t know who created the story or why, and I don’t agree with his conclusions either, but I still love it.
The story is simple. You may have heard it, but perhaps not understood it because it is so simple. Everybody thinks he understands simplicity. It’s a strange world.</description>

Man is not centered in himself. He is born centered, but the society, the family, the education, the culture, they push him off-center, and they put him off-center in a very cunning way, knowingly or unknowingly.</description>

[Satyam Jon: truth, Gods gracious gift]
We are it, hence one has not to seek it somewhere else. Seeking it is a sure way of missing it. All seeking is desire, and desire takes you farther away from yourself. Desire is nothing but a way of going away from oneself. Desire is escaping from oneself – even the desire for God or the desire for truth.</description>

‌CHAPTER 38
8 September 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Adam represents rebellion, Osho tells the ten year old boy.]
He rebelled against God, he rebelled against the authoritarian forces. He is not only the first man, he is the first revolutionary too. And I have tremendous respect for rebellion, because one grows only through rebellion; one becomes oneself only through – by going into – deep rebellion.</description>

Okay.
I wanted to tell you a simple truth, perhaps forgotten for its simplicity; and no religion can practice it because the moment you become part of a religion you are no longer simple nor religious. I wanted to tell you just a very simple thing which I have learned the hard way. Perhaps you are getting it too cheap, and the simple is generally mistaken for the cheap.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS THERE ANY BIOLOGICAL CHANCE OF AN UNCONDITIONED, FREE AND LOVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT?
Absolutely no. Biology is blind; hence there is no biological chance. But you can get over biology. You are conscious, intelligent human beings, so there is a possibility; but the possibility will be through meditation, not through biology.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS BEYOND PSYCHOTHERAPY? PLEASE EXPLAIN.
Beyond psychotherapy is your real being. Psychotherapy is confined to the mind – and you are not the mind. The West has always divided man into body and mind. The East, which knows more, knows that there is something beyond this duality of body-mind.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO I ALLOW HABIT TO DOMINATE CONSCIOUSNESS?
Almost everybody does it, unless one becomes enlightened.
The habit is the easier way to do a thing. The whole mechanism of a habit is that you need not be conscious about it. It has become a mechanical part of you, a part of your robot mind: it does things by itself.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THE WORLD TO ACCEPT YOU AS YOU ARE?
There are many implications.
First, the world never accepts anybody as he is. That is something very fundamental about the world and the way it treats individuals.
The individual is small; the individual is born helpless, a child.</description>

“IN WHICH WAY DOES THE MODERNIZED ORIGINAL MIND BECOME IDENTIFIED WITH THE DUST OF THE PAST KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE?”
Mind is pure, and no impurity can enter it. That is impossible. The mind is just the buddha-nature – the ultimate. And when I say “mind,” I don’t mean your mind, I simply mean the mind where no I and you exist.</description>

Prem Alice. Prem means love; alice means truthful one, noble one, cheerful one. They are all the three great qualities – truth, nobility and cheerfulness – but they all come through love!
Bliss is the ultimate goal of life, and the people who become blissful, naturally become messengers of God; not that they have to do something – their very blissfulness becomes a message to the world, their very cheerfulness is heard far and wide.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
4 February 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss and citta means mind – bliss mind. In English you don’t have many words for the mind but in Sanskrit we have many words for the mind to denote different qualities. The only way to translate citta is. mind with a capital ‘M’. It is not ordinary mind, it is the cosmic Mind.</description>

Okay. Get ready for your notes.
The world would have lost much without people like Devageet. We would not have known anything of Socrates if Plato had not written notes, nor of Buddha, nor Bodhidharma. Jesus too is known through his disciples’ notes. Mahavira is said never to have uttered a single word. I know the meaning of why it is said.</description>

31 July 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love and bhagwatam means divine, godly. And love is always godly. Howsoever imperfect, it is always godly. You may understand it, you may not understand it, but it is godly. Love is the only proof of god – that he exists. And people who don’t know what love is can never know what god is.</description>

Question 1
OSHO, YOU HAVE TOLD US WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SOUL DURING THAT TIMELESS INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO BIRTHS. BUT SOME POINTS REMAIN UNRESOLVED, REGARDING THE BODILESS SOUL: IN THAT BODILESS STATE, DOES THE SOUL REMAIN STATIONARY OR CAN IT MOVE ABOUT? AND HOW DOES IT RECOGNIZE OTHER SOULS? IN THAT STATE, IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOULS?</description>

Deva is a sanskrit root; it means divine. Hasido is a hebrew root; it means pious – divinely pious. There is a piety that can be cultivated by man, but deep down it remains an ego trip. Only on the surface is it pious. Deep down it is just the opposite. It is the ego playing a new game.</description>

People are very miserly in loving and living, and that’s why they are miserable. A miser is bound to remain miserable. Life is only for the quick and the spendthrift. Life is only for the extravagant... for those who can overflow, for those who are caring yet careless.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I feel I have a legacy of laziness and escapism. Either I don’t feel energy, or if I do, I find it difficult to just completely let go. I feel a control.]
I feel it is somewhere and has become part of your bio-computer. The mind functions as a computer, and we go on feeding it attitudes.</description>

4 July 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand Paul. Anand means bliss; paul means small. The way to be great is to be small; the way to be superior is to be a nobody. The superior man is not aware that he is. He is humble, not even conscious of his humbleness. Then bliss is natural.
Be a nobody, and you will be fulfilled.</description>

Do you know what Joshua means?...
It is the same as Jesus; the real name of Jesus was Joshua.
It means for which the people have been waiting, the awaited one. Deva Joshua means the divine one for which the world has been waiting.
Prem means love; lalit means beautiful. Love is beautiful, and anything else, that which is not love, is bound to be ugly.</description>

Deva Helen. Deva means divine, helen means light – divine light. Light represents the manifest part of God; darkness represents the unmanifest part. Both are divine, but darkness is the seed and light is the flower; darkness is the womb, light is the child.
Meditate on light, and the more you meditate on light, the more you will be surprised that something inside starts opening, as if a bud is opening and becoming a flower.</description>

[Gyan anala: knowledge fire]
Knowing is fire. You can use knowledge. Knowledge is something dead in your hands; you can possess it, you can control it. But you cannot possess knowing; knowing is fire, it consumes you. In the knowing the knower disappears: in knowledge the knower remains in control.
When you are in the moment of knowing, you are not.</description>

Deva means divine, sankirtan means holy singing, holy song. Life is sacred song; that’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Man cannot live by bread alone.’ The bread represents the business-side of life, it represents the calculative mind. And if life is only bread, then it is meaningless; the bread cannot give meaning to it.</description>

Anand means bliss, tim is a short form of Timotheus. It is a Greek name; it means worshipping god, honouring god. And bliss is possible only if you become related with the existence in a personal way. That’s what the word ‘god’ implies – a personal relationship with existence.
The person who does not believe in god does believe in existence but there is no personal bridge, there is no love affair.</description>

Deva means divine, jurgen means a farmer.
Life is an opportunity, just a seed. One can miss it, one can remain a seed; that will be the missing of the opportunity. One has to seek the right soil. One has to be a farmer; One has to learn how to grow.
All that is needed in farming is needed in inner growth too: the right soil, the right season, protection for the new sprouts, the right quantity of water and sun and air, and not too much protection; that is the most important thing, because too much protection will not be helpful, it will be harmful.</description>

[Premdipa:] Man remains an unlit candle unless love comes and engulfs him, overpowers him. It is only the light of love that takes away the inner darkness. Without love the inner world is utterly dark; not even a ray of light is possible without love. And it is not accidental that people don’t look inwards: there is nothing to see; it is all dark, it is frighteningly dark and it is very lonely.</description>

Beyond mind to awareness
28 December 1973 pm in
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES FOR MEN, EITHER MADNESS OR MEDITATION, BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH HAVE NOT REACHED TO EITHER OF THE TWO. DO YOU THINK THEY WILL?
They have reached! They have not reached to meditation, but they have reached to madness!</description>

Boy! Did we Shake that Thing!
14 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU SEE INNOCENCE AS THE OPPOSITE OF KNOWLEDGE – BUT WHAT ABOUT IGNORANCE? PEOPLE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ARE SO OFTEN MISUSED BY THE ONES WITH THE KNOWLEDGE. PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
Ignorance is the state which exists before knowledge, innocence is the state which exists after knowledge.</description>

Breaking the shell of the past
21 January 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
AND A WOMAN SPOKE, SAYING, TELL US OF PAIN. AND HE SAID:
YOUR PAIN IS THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL THAT ENCLOSES YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
EVEN AS THE STONE OF THE FRUIT MUST BREAK, THAT ITS HEART MAY STAND IN THE SUN, SO MUST YOU KNOW PAIN.</description>

24 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:

SOMETIMES YOU CALL US ‘YOU FOOLS’ AND SOMETIMES YOU CALL US ‘YOU BUDDHAS’. ARE FOOLS AND BUDDHAS THE SAME TO YOU?
They are not the same to me but they are both meeting in you right now, shaking hands within you. Your past is the fool, your future is the buddha, and at this moment they are both within you.</description>

Contrary to Expectation
24 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
A WISE MAN, THE WONDER OF HIS AGE, TAUGHT HIS DISCIPLES FROM A SEEMINGLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF WISDOM.
HE ATTRIBUTED ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE TO A THICK TOME WHICH WAS KEPT IN A PLACE OF HONOR IN HIS ROOM.
THE SAGE WOULD ALLOW NOBODY TO OPEN THE VOLUME.
WHEN HE DIED, THOSE WHO HAD SURROUNDED HIM, REGARDING THEMSELVES AS HIS HEIRS, RAN TO OPEN THE BOOK, ANXIOUS TO POSSESS WHAT IT CONTAINED.</description>

Danger: truth at work
2 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY ARE THE COMMON MASSES AGAINST YOU, WHEN WHAT YOU SAY APPEARS TO US THE VERY TRUTH?
THAT’S precisely why – because it appears to be the very truth.
Truth is dangerous, dangerous to all those people who have been living in fictions, beautiful lies, nice dreams, utopias.</description>

Darkness: the substance existence is made of
31 December 1985 am in Kathmandu, Nepal
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT DARKNESS?
I have much to say about darkness, because nobody has taken notice of the mystery that darkness is.
Much has been said about light, almost nothing about darkness. But darkness is a much deeper phenomenon than light is.</description>

LAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT DESIRES MOVE BETWEEN THE DEAD PAST AND THE IMAGINARY FUTURE. PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY THIS DEAD PAST PROVES SO DYNAMIC AND POWERFUL THAT IT COMPELS A PERSON TO FLOW INTO THE PROCESS OF ENDLESS DESIRE.

Desiring the Unattainable
8 April 1973 am in Bikaner Palace Hotel
DESIRE ONLY THAT WHICH IS WITHIN YOU.
IT LOOKS ABSURD, PARADOXICAL, ILLOGICAL: DESIRE ONLY THAT WHICH IS WITHIN YOU.
Desire is basically for that which is not within you. Desire means the desire for something that is not within you. If it is already within you, then what is the need to desire it?</description>

The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE BERTOLT BRECHT WHO REJECT RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY AND YET WHOSE POWERFUL CREATIVE LOVE SHINES LIKE AN ANGRY LIGHT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
TIM GREEN,
Religion for centuries has become associated with a life-negative attitude, and obviously any life negative attitude cannot be creative; it becomes intrinsically impossible for it to be creative.</description>

SITTING NEAR YOU I INCREASINGLY FEEL DEEP SILENCE AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE EMPTINESS, BUT THERE IS NO BLISS IN IT. I TEND TO REGARD THIS AS AN INDICATION THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG, ESPECIALLY AT DARSHAN WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO BLISSFUL.

3 March 1967 pm in Sadar Vallabhai Patel University
There was a fakir who was very alone. He saw God in his dream and found that he was even more alone. The fakir was puzzled and asked God, “Why are you also so alone? You have many devotees – where are they?”
On hearing this, God said, “I have always been alone, and hence only those who become absolutely alone are able to experience me.</description>

THIS TEACHING IS THE SCHOOL OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND. THE ENLIGHTENED MIND ITSELF BASICALLY HAS NO DELUSION OR ENLIGHTENMENT. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SUBTLE ART OF THOSE WHO REALIZE THUSNESS. EVEN IF YOU DON’T BECOME ENLIGHTENED, WHEN YOU SIT ONCE IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR THAT SITTING; WHEN YOU SIT FOR A DAY IN MEDITATION, YOU ARE A BUDDHA FOR A DAY; WHEN YOU SIT IN MEDITATION ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE A BUDDHA ALL YOUR LIFE.</description>

I have just been to the Girnar mountains, where the temples glisten in the morning sun. Seeing these temples, it occurred to me: The soul too has such high peaks where temples shine even brighter; for the Lord’s light is more keen and intense than the Sun’s light. But we are such; we lose ourselves in the temples outside and get no hint of the temples within.</description>

Happiness Knows No Tomorrow
5 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAY THAT MIND’S SUBSTANCE IS MEMORY AND INFORMATION. DOES READING THEREFORE INFLATE AND INVIGORATE THE MIND?
It depends. It depends on you. You can use reading as a food for the ego. It is very subtle. You can become knowledgeable; then it is dangerous and harmful.</description>

Hatha Yoga: A Valid Approach?
Date Unknown
Question
IN TRADITIONAL YOGA, ONE STARTS WITH THE BODY – THROUGH HATHA YOGA METHODS. WHY IS IT THAT YOU DO NOT TEACH HATHA YOGA .
It is good to start with the body, it is necessary. But it is not sufficient. There are many problems with Hatha Yoga particularly for those in the West, because the system of Hatha Yoga and its related techniques were all developed in a very different milieu – really, for very differently constituted bodies as well as for different minds.</description>

Hollow man or hollow bamboo
4 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means blissful, bhagat means a devotee a follower on the path of love.
There are three paths; one is of knowledge, of meditation, of purifying the intelligence. The second is of action, of service. And the third is of devotion, of love, of the heart. The path of action is body-oriented, the path of knowledge is mind-oriented, and the path of devotion is heart-oriented</description>

Deva means divine, and dhurva means fresh grass, just sprouting... very green, delicate – divine grass. And there is a particular meaning in it.
A man can exist in two ways: either like a very strong tree – resistant, fighting, stubborn – or like small grass – non-resistant, non-fighting, ready to yield.</description>

Misery is the prison, nothingness is the door
19 August 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DON’T WE DROP OUR MISERIES, OUR IGNORANCE AND UNHAPPINESS? HOW CAN A MAN BE HAPPY AND BLISSFUL?
It is one of the most fundamental questions that a man can ask.
It is also strange, because it should be easy to drop suffering, anguish, misery.</description>

Mystical Unknowing

BUT TAKE HEED LEST THE PROFANE HEAR THOSE, I SAY, WHO CLING TO CREATURES, AND IMAGINE IN THEMSELVES THAT NOTHING IS BEYOND BEING, BEYOND EXISTENCES, BUT SUPPOSE THEMSELVES TO KNOW HIM “WHO MAKETH DARKNESS HIS HIDING PLACE.” IF, THEN, THE DIVINE MYSTERIES ARE BEYOND SUCH, WHAT SHALL BE SAID OF THOSE YET MORE PROFANE WHO CONCEIVE THAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE OUTWARD FORMS OF THINGS AND ASSERT THAT HE EXCEEDS NOT THESE IMPIOUS AND MANIFOLD CONCEITS OF THEIR OWN MAKING?</description>

Never meditate over something
23 December 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “MEDITATE OVER” SOMETHING? I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO “THINK OVER” SOMETHING; THAT’S WHAT THE MIND IS CONTINUOUSLY DOING: REMEMBERING, ANALYZING, PLANNING, IMAGINING, ETCETERA.
I ALSO CAME TO KNOW A STATE OF MEDITATION WHERE THE “I” IS NO MORE, WHERE ALL THE BOUNDARIES ARE LOST, JUST A MELTING INTO THE WHOLE, A DISAPPEARING, WEIGHTLESSNESS, LIGHT, AND BLISS.</description>

WHAT IS NOT ILLUSION?
All is illusion except the witness. All is dream except the witness. Only the knower is true, is real. Whatsoever you see is illusory; the seer is not illusory. In the night you see one type of dream, in the day you see another type of dream.</description>

Nonstealing
12 November 1970 am in
Life is a network of interconnected relationships. An individual is required to be interrelated. Even an interrelationship is a relationship between two individuals. But two individuals are necessary for a relationship to establish. So life when seen from outside is interrelated; but along with it life is also interrelated from within. If that individual is not there, all the interrelationships become false.</description>

PLEASE ALSO EXPLAIN THE ROLE THAT THE BUDDHAS, THE ENLIGHTENED ONES, PLAY IN THE EXPANSION OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS.
Evolution is unconscious. No volition is needed, no conscious effort: it is just natural.</description>

And poetry is the right approach towards life: prose is not the right approach. They are worlds apart – poetry and prose – and they are the two approaches to know.
By prose I mean the logical approach, the argumentative, the rational, and by poetry I mean the feeling approach, the aesthetic approach, the intuitive approach.</description>

Deva means god, svarupo means self-nature. God is our self nature. God is not separate – god is our very being. He has not to be attained, only discovered. He is hidden in us; there is no need to go anywhere else to find him. One has to be silent enough and relaxed enough to feel him.</description>

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREAT SEXUAL SUPPRESSION AND FREEDOM FROM SEX? ON THE SURFACE, BOTH HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEX. HOW DOES SUPPRESSED SEX BUBBLE UP?
First, suppressed sex has more interest than expressed sex can ever have. The interest is not direct – it is indirect, it is vicarious, it is cunning; the interest is there, immensely there.</description>

Such a moon
30 June 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
ONE DAY KYOZAN WAS LOOKING AT THE MOON TOGETHER WITH SEKISHITSU AND ASKED HIM,
“WHERE DOES THE ROUNDNESS OF THE MOON GO WHEN IT BECOMES SHARP, CRESCENT?”
SEKISHITSU SAID, “WHEN IT IS SHARP, THE ROUNDNESS IS STILL THERE.”
Maneesha, existence can be approached only in two ways: the way of philosophy and the way of poetry.</description>

MY FRIEND, WHO HAS A PH.D. IN COMPUTING, AND WHOSE THESIS WAS ON “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE”, SAYS THAT MAN IS A BIOCHEMICAL COMPUTER AND NOTHING MORE. THE BUDDHA HAS SAID THAT ALL THINGS ARE COMPOSITE AND THERE IS NO SELF, NO SOUL, NO SPIRIT, NO “I”, WHICH SEEMS TO AGREE WITH MY FRIEND’S VIEWPOINT.</description>

JESUS SAID: TAKE NO THOUGHT FROM THE MORNING UNTIL THE EVENING AND FROM THE EVENING UNTIL THE MORNING, FOR WHAT YOU SHALL PUT ON.
HIS DISCIPLES SAID: WHEN WILT THOU BE REVEALED TO US AND WHEN WILL WE SEE THEE?
JESUS SAID: WHEN YOU TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHING WITHOUT BEING ASHAMED, AND TAKE YOUR CLOTHES AND PUT THEM UNDER YOUR FEET AS THE LITTLE CHILDREN AND TREAD ON THEM – THEN SHALL YOU BEHOLD THE SON OF THE LIVING ONE, AND YOU SHALL NOT FEAR.</description>

Tantra’s secrets of love and liberation
28 March 1973 pm in Bombay, India
The first question:
Question 1
“IN REFERENCE TO YOUR STATEMENT THAT TANTRA IS A LOVE TECHNIQUE, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY MODERN MAN AND WOMAN HAVE BECOME INCAPABLE OF LOVE.”
Love is spontaneous. It cannot be controlled. You cannot “make” love; you cannot do anything about it. And the more you do, the more you will miss it.</description>

Tao Tantra
28 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU HAVE TALKED MUCH ON LOVE, RELATIONSHIPS, UNION, ETC. IS THERE A MERGING BETWEEN THE TAO AND TANTRA?
TANTRA MEANS TECHNIQUE – and Tao can have no relationship with any technique whatsoever. Tao is non-methodological, non-technical. Tao means spontaneity. How can spontaneity have a technique? You cannot practise it; if you practise it you miss it.</description>

THE TAO PRODUCES ALL THINGS AND NOURISHES THEM;
IT PRODUCES THEM AND DOES NOT CLAIM THEM AS ITS OWN. IT DOES ALL, AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT.
IT PRESIDES OVER ALL, AND YET DOES NOT CONTROL THEM. THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED THE MYSTERIOUS QUALITY OF THE TAO.</description>

DO YOU THINK THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IS AFRAID OF YOU?
Absolutely – otherwise there is no reason to make a law that I cannot enter Germany. I have never been in Germany; I have never committed any crime against German law. I have not even applied for any tourist visa, so from my side there has been no question of entering Germany.</description>

The death penalty is a degrading proof of man’s inhumanity to man. It shows that man is still living in the barbarous age. Civilization still remains an idea – it has not become a reality.</description>

The Three Jewelled Rings
5 March 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MAN WHO HAD A SON. HE SAID TO HIM, “MY SON, HERE IS A JEWELLED RING. KEEP IT AS A SIGN THAT YOU ARE A SUCCESSOR OF MINE, AND PASS IT DOWN TO YOUR POSTERITY. IT IS OF VALUE, OF FINE APPEARANCE, AND IT HAS THE ADDED CAPACITY OF OPENING A CERTAIN DOOR TO WEALTH.</description>

Dr. Frank Rudolf spent his whole life with some primitive tribes of the Amazon doing research on a very strange phenomenon. I would like to tell you about it so that you can understand more easily what idol worship was meant for. Most primitive communities have known for a long time of a particular process.</description>

The True Desire
5 April 1971 pm in Mt. Abu, Rajasthan, India
THE ASURAS – THE DEMONS –
ARE THOSE WHO ARE ENVELOPED
IN THE DARKNESS OF SELF-IGNORANCE. THOSE WHO ARE KILLERS OF THE SELF GO TO THE WORLD OF THE ASURAS AFTER DEATH.
The Upanishads divide man into two categories. First, those who kill the atman – the self; they are suicidal because they kill their own selves.</description>

THEN WHY HAS THE WORLD ALWAYS BEEN IN CHAOS AND DISORDER?
THE WORLD has never been in chaos and disorder, only the mind. The world is absolutely orderly. It is not a chaos, it is a cosmos.</description>

Question 1
WHY DOES ALL THAT YOU SAY SEEM COMPLETELY FAMILIAR? I HAVE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT SOUNDS FULL OF WONDERFUL REVELATIONS.

Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRYSTALLIZED SELF AND A BIG, STRONG EGO?
THEY LOOK ALIKE, but they are as different as two things can be. Not only different, they are diametrically opposite. The crystallized self is not a self at all. It is called a crystallized “self,” but it is not a self at all.</description>

Question 1
WHY AM I ALWAYS INTERESTED IN MARRIED WOMEN?
There is nothing special about it, it is a very common disease which exists in almost epidemic proportions. But there are reasons to it.
Millions of people, both men and women, are more interested in the married person. First, the unmarried person shows that nobody has yet desired him or her; the married person shows that somebody has desired him.</description>

All and nothing mean the same
8 November 1973 pm in Bombay, India
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THAT REALLY THERE IS NO ONE INSIDE US, THERE IS ONLY A VOID, AN EMPTINESS, BUT THEN WHY DO YOU OFTEN CALL IT THE BEING, THE CENTER?
Being or non-being, nothing or all – they look contradictory but they both mean the same. All and nothing mean the same.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IT IS SAID THAT WHEN BUDDHA ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE BECAME BLISSFUL – FLOWERS SHOWERED FROM THE SKY, DEITIES BEGAN TO DANCE AROUND HIM. INDRA, HIMSELF, THE KING OF ALL THE DEVAS, CAME DOWN WITH FOLDED PALMS AND SURRENDERED AT BUDDHA’S FEET.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN A “GROUPIE” SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF. I HAVE BEEN IN SUCH MISERY THAT ALMOST NOTHING ASKED OF ME WAS TOO MUCH IF IT HELD A CHANCE OF ALLEVIATING MY DISTRESS.

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IS THE MEETING OF ZORBA AND THE BUDDHA REALLY POSSIBLE? IF IT IS SO, THEN WHY HAVE OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
The first thing to be understood: I am not a religious leader. A religious leader cannot think, cannot see the way I can – for the simple reason that he has immense investment in religion; I have none.</description>

[Love is the source of wisdom, mind... ]
It is worldly, it can’t be sacred. The sacred arises out of the heart; it is intuitive, not intellectual. It is less logical, more paradoxical. It is rooted in love, not in logic, and love is the greatest mystery in existence. Love becomes the door to the divine.</description>

I have always wondered how God could manage to make this world in only six days. And this world! Perhaps that’s why He called His son Jesus! What a name to give to your own son! He had to punish somebody for what He had done, and there was nobody else available. The Holy Ghost is always absent; he is sitting there on the horse seat, that’s why I told Chetana to vacate it, because to ride a horse with somebody already riding on it is not good.</description>

The blessed ones
27 October 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
YOU SAID BUDDHA IS A STATE OF NO-MIND. THEN HOW CAN THERE BE ANY PSYCHOLOGY OF THE BUDDHAS?
PLEASE EXPLAIN.
There can only be a psychology of the buddhas. The man who is in the mind cannot be objective about it. It is as if a madman were doing research on madness.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ONESELF AND BEING EGOLESS?
There is no difference between being oneself and being egoless. The difference is only in the expression. If you see it from the negative standpoint, egolessness will be the expression because ego disappears.
If you see it from the positive standpoint then being oneself will be the expression.</description>

[Blanka means white, the most paradoxical of colors]
In one sense it is a color and in one sense it is not. It is a color because it contains all the colors; the whole spectrum of the rainbow is contained in white. And yet it is not a color at all because it is neither red nor blue, nor green – it is a transcendence of colors.</description>

The story of Mahatma Gandhi’s death, and Jawaharlal’s bursting into tears on the radio, stunned the whole world. It was not a prepared speech. He was just speaking out of his own heart, and if tears came, what could he do? And if there was a pause, it was not his fault but his greatness.</description>

EVERY TIME YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSFORMING PASSION INTO COMPASSION, SOMETHING IN MY HEART GETS TRIGGERED; BUT STILL, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS.

Become a prayer of rejoicing. Jesus says again and again to his disciples: Rejoice, rejoice, I say unto you, rejoice!

Because of that, religion become more and more crowded by pathological people. Healthy people started avoiding religion, because health is bliss and health is cheerfulness.

Religion has nothing to do with seriousness; seriousness is pathology. Religion is playful, sportlike, it is fun. Prayer is playing with God, and it is possible only if one remembers that one has to continuously choose to be cheerful.</description>

‌CHAPTER 49
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, USA
It is good that I cannot see, but I know what is going on. But what can you do? You have to follow your own technology, and with a man like me, naturally you are in a great difficulty. I am tied and can’t help you.
Ashu, can you do something? Just a little laughter on your side will help him keep quiet.</description>

Adhyatma Upanishad
20 October 1972 pm at Mt Abu Meditation Camp, India
PRARBDHAKARMA FULFILLS ITSELF ONLY WHEN ONE IDENTIFIES THE SELF WITH THE BODY, BUT IT IS NO GOOD IDENTIFYING WITH THE BODY. WHO WANTS TO SEVER THIS IDENTIFICATION AND FREE HIM SELF OF PRARBDHAKARMA, ILLUSION OF THE BODY IS THE BASIS FOR THE PROJECTION OF THE PRARBDHAKARMA.
BUT THAT WHICH IS PROJECTED OR IMAGINED BY ILLUSION CAN NEVER BE REAL.</description>

Anand means bliss and Rudra is one of the names of Shiva. The Hindus have a trinity of gods. Brahma is the creator god, or God’s creative function. Vishnu is one who maintains the existence, or God’s maintaining function. And Shiva or Rudra is one who destroys the world when it is no more needed; God’s destructive functioning.</description>

[A sannyasin asks: How is it possible always to remain centred? There is a tendency to go astray...
]
Don’t create any conflict about going astray and being centred. Float. If you create a conflict, if you become afraid of going astray, then there is more possibility that you will go astray – because whatsoever you try to suppress becomes very significant.</description>

[A sannyasin says: I’m wondering about my relationship. There is a lot of good feeling, but we’re sort of keeping each other safe, and I feel restricted.
We’ll both be starting groups and I think we’ll be able to branch out.]
No relationship can truly grow if you go on holding back. If you remain clever and go on safeguarding and protecting yourself, only personalities meet, and the essential centres remain alone.</description>

Anand Gitta. Anand means bliss; gitta comes from a root which means bridge.
Bliss is the bridge. Nobody ever has entered into God without being blissful. The doors are closed for miserable people. Those who cling to misery will remain without God, because misery disconnects you from existence, it isolates you. Misery makes you an ego.</description>

That’s the point to be understood. If you can understand that you are also not there, then you have understood rightly. But if sannyas is not there, religion is not there, meditation is not there, and you remain there, then you have not understood at all.</description>

15 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ONE WHO WALKS ALONE
CONFUSED, CHOOSING FOR AND AGAINST, THE WHOLE WORLD GOES ASTRAY. CHOICELESS AND CELEBRATING GOD;
HE IS A TRUE SADHU.
PEOPLE ALL BOUND TOGETHER AS DONKEY TIED TO DONKEY. WHO HAS INNER VISION,
HE’S AUTHENTIC MAN. ONE WHO WALKS ALONE, HE ALONE FINDS TRUTH. HEART ABSORBED IN LOVE
NEVER AGAIN COMES BACK.</description>

[Osho gives a meditation to a sannyasin.]
You start one meditation, and that is just sitting silently and allowing your fingers to have their own movement. Feel the movement from the inside. Don’t try to see it from the outside. So keep your eyes closed and just feel the movements from inside. let the energy flow more and more into the hands.</description>

Deva Viyog. It means separation from god. That’s where we are... that’s why there is so much anguish; and once we consciously understand it union becomes possible. Right now we are separate, we are like islands – have lost contact with the continent. We have forgotten that we are rooted in god: god seems to be just a fantasy, not a reality.</description>

Gurudas. Guru means the master, and das means the servant – the servant of the master. And it is very significant in the east. The very concept of guru is eastern; the word cannot even be rightly translated. When we translate it as ‘master’ much of its meaning is lost, because a master means a teacher – the guru is not a teacher.</description>

Astrology is perhaps the most ancient subject and also in a way the most tabooed. It is the most ancient because as far back as we have been able to investigate the history of mankind, astrology has been in existence. Astrological inscriptions have been found on bone remnants from the Sumerian civilization which existed twenty-five thousand years before Jesus.</description>

Mm mm, good! Something has happened and it will go on growing. It is not like a thing that happens; it is a process.
It will go on happening. Just cooperate with it; don’t stop it!</description>

Dropping the Ego Now
14 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAID THE EGO CAN BE DROPPED THIS VERY MOMENT. CAN THE EGO ALSO BE DROPPED PROGRESSIVELY?
The dropping always happens in the moment and always in THIS moment. There is no progressive, gradual process for it. There cannot be. The happening is instantaneous. You can’t get ready for it, you can’t prepare for it, because whatsoever you do – and I say whatsoever – will strengthen the ego.</description>

Dynamic Meditation or, Silent Meditation
QUESTION: DYNAMIC MEDITATION IS VERY ACTIVE, VERY STRENUOUS.CAN ONE NOT GO INTO MEDITATION JUST BY SITTING SILENTLY?
You can go into meditation just by sitting, but then be just sitting; do not do anything else. If you can be just sitting, it becomes meditation. Be completely in the sitting; nonmovement should be your only movement. In fact, the word zen comes from the word zazen, which means, just sitting, doing nothing.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS RENUNCIATION? WHAT IS ITS PLACE IN YOUR RELIGION?
THE idea of renunciation is one of the fundamentals of all pseudo-religions. Its phenomenology has to be understood very deeply.
All the religions have been preaching a division between this world and that world which is beyond death – between the soul and the body.</description>

The first thing to be understood is that the division between body and mind is abso-lutely false. If you begin with that division you will reach nowhere; a false beginning leads nowhere.</description>

FRIENDS, OF THIS HIGHEST GOOD, BECOME AWARE. IN NONMEMORY IS MIND ABSORBED;
JUST THIS IS EMOTIONALITY PERFECT AND PURE.
IT IS UNPOLLUTED BY THE GOOD OR BAD OF WORLDLINESS</description>

7 May 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A sannyasin says: I feel very good since the Primal group. I feel aware of my feminine part somehow.]
That’s very good. Ordinarily we go on repressing one part of the being because we are taught to be males or to be females. No society allows that man is bi-sexual, that he is both; that man is not a fixed identity, not somehow static, but a dynamic process.</description>

Man’s is Life’s Invention
15 August 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES LIFE HAVE RELEVANCE TO LOGIC?
Mavji Savla,
LOGIC is a very small thing, life is vast. Logic is utilitarian, it is an invention of man. Life is non-utilitarian, it is not an invention of man; on the contrary, man is life’s invention.</description>

From tomorrow, mornings will be devoted to meditation alone and evenings to discourses exclusively. But this day we will follow the day’s schedule.
Take your seats apart, keeping a distance from one another. But do not go far, because this morning I noticed that friends who had moved far were deprived of the benefits of the psychic atmosphere that is being created here.</description>

rigid form, it is not giving you a certain discipline – on the contrary it is an initiation into freedom, into a formless creative chaos.
The old concept of sannyas all over the world was to give you a rigid discipline, to give you a character, to give you a certain form, a pattern, a life style.</description>

THE movement of human consciousness from darkness to light, from unconsciousness to consciousness, is the greatest revolution there is.
Everything in human life changes, even with a slight movement in consciousness. All depends on where your consciousness is.</description>

WHO KNOWS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS THE HIGHEST; WHO PRETENDS TO KNOW WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS SICKMINDED. AND WHO RECOGNIZES SICKMINDEDNESS AS SICKMINDEDNESS, IS NOT SICKMINDED. THE SAGE IS NOT SICKMINDED. BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES SICKMINDEDNESS AS SICKMINDEDNESS, THEREFORE HE IS NOT SICKMINDED.
Man is like an onion, exactly like an onion; layers and layers of personality; and behind all those layers is hidden the essence.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
OBAKU ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLY AND SAID, “YOU ARE ALL PARTAKERS OF BREWER’S GRAIN. IF YOU GO ON STUDYING ZEN LIKE THAT, YOU WILL NEVER FINISH IT. DO YOU KNOW THAT IN ALL THE LAND OF T’ANG THERE IS NO ZEN TEACHER?”

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THE REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE?
The psychology movement is basically male chauvinist, and strangely, it has exploited women more than men.
Most of the differences between men and women are because of thousands of years of conditioning. They are not fundamental to nature, but there are a few differences which give them unique beauty, individuality.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW COME YOU SPEAK ABOUT POLITICAL LEADERS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE SAME TONE – IS THERE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM?
Fundamentally there is no difference at all. Superficially of course there are differences.
The basic desire to be a leader arises in people who are suffering from an inferiority complex.</description>

The perfect swimmer
15 October 1975 am in Buddha Hall
WHEN THE SON OF THE RABBI OF LENSHNO WAS A BOY HE SAW RABBI VITZHAK OF VORKI, PRAYING. FULL OF AMAZEMENT, HE CAME RUNNING TO HIS FATHER AND ASKED HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR SUCH A ZADDICK TO PRAY QUIETLY AND SIMPLY, WITHOUT GIVING ANY SIGN OF ECSTASY.
HIS FATHER ANSWERED:-‘A POOR SWIMMER HAS TO THRASH AROUND IN ORDER TO STAY UP IN THE WATER.</description>

The Second Evening
5 June 1964 pm
Question 1
THE FIRST QUESTION: DO YOU THINK IT IS A BAD THING TO BE MORAL?
No. I do not consider it bad to be moral but I do consider the illusion of being moral bad. It gets in the way of real morality.
False morality is an outer coating, a covering. It serves no purpose other than satisfying hypocrisy and in my view there is no greater immoral state of mind than that of hypocrisy and egoism.</description>

SHOULD YOU QUESTION YOURSELF IN THIS WISE, WITH PROFOUND ABSORPTION, NEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT, YOUR RATIONAL MIND EVENTUALLY WILL EXHAUST ITSELF AND ONLY QUESTIONING AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL WILL REMAIN.</description>

THINGS ARE OBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECT; THE MIND IS SUCH BECAUSE OF THINGS.
UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVITY OF THESE TWO AND THE BASIC REALITY: THE UNITY OF EMPTINESS.
IN THIS EMPTINESS THE TWO ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE AND EACH CONTAINS IN ITSELF THE WHOLE WORLD.</description>

SO MANY TIMES I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, BUT SOMEHOW THE SILENCE SAYS IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE WORDS.
Yoga Chetana,
The really significant things in life can never be said through words; only silence is capable of communion.Words are utilitarian, they belong to the marketplace; hence, when you really want to say something of the heart, you will always find it unsayable.</description>

THE SUFI SAID, “HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF THE MONGOL HALAKU KHAN AND HIS INVASION OF SYRIA?</description>

[Prem Paula]
The moment you say God, it creates an idea of a person, which is dangerous because there is no person, there is no God as a person. When you say love it does not give you any idea of a person; it simply gives you a vision, a vision of loving energy – a presence, not a person.</description>

Adhyatma Upanishad
21 October 1972 am at Mt Abu Meditation Camp, India
THE SCRIPTURES DO NOT SAY THAT THE BODY IS REAL FOR THE KNOWER, BUT THEY SAY SO FOR THE IGNORANT.
IN REALITY, THERE IS ONLY THE NON-DUAL SUPREME, WHICH IS ONE WITHOUT A SECOND, AND NOTHING ELSE EXISTS EXCEPT IT.
AND THE SUPREME IS KNOWN AS SOMETHING WITHOUT BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END – IMMEASURABLE, PURE, INNOCENT, EXISTENTIAL, CONSCIOUS, ETERNAL, BLISSFUL, IMPERISHABLE, ALL-PERVADING, NON-DUAL, ESTABLISHED ALWAYS IN ONENESS.</description>

[Veet Richard – to go beyond all hardness. Hardness has been revered in the past, but all it does is desensitize you... ]
It creates a good soldier but does not create a good human being. It makes a man violent, and to be violent is to fall below humanity. Man is man only because he is capable of love, and love arises only when the heart is soft, not hard.</description>

But there are things which cannot be achieved through effort, which are achieved only through effortlessness. Those are the things of the inner world the other world; they don’t belong to this shore. Bliss, love, prayer, God – they can’t be achieved through human effort.
Human effort is so small, it cannot contain such vast experiences.</description>

Bodhi Patricia. We are all somnambulists unless bodhi happens, unless enlightenment happens. We are only awake for the name’s sake. Deep down there is sleep, an undercurrent of sleep continues, because an undercurrent of dreaming continues. You can catch hold of it any moment – close your eyes and see what is going on: there are dreams and dreams floating, a long procession of desires, thoughts, memories.</description>

Premmurti. It means image of love. Open your heart more, think less. Get down from the head to the heart, feel more. Through feeling more one gets to the being; through thinking more one gets away from the being. Thinking creates distance from yourself; feeling destroys the distance. The ultimate in thinking is schizophrenia, you become two; the distance is so much that it becomes unbridgeable.</description>

Anand means bliss, salama means peace. Bliss can have two expressions: either it can be an ecstasy, overflowing, or it can be silence, peace, stillness. If bliss flows outward it is ecstatic. If it simply remains in then it is peace, and peace is a higher state than ecstasy. Even if one has attained to ecstatic joy, one has to go one step more, because one cannot remain in ecstasy forever; it tires.</description>

‌DHRITARASHTRA SAID:
O SANJAY, ASSEMBLED ON THE FIELD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, THE FIELD OF THE KURUS, AND EAGER TO FIGHT, WHAT DID MY SONS AND THE SONS OF PANDU DO?
Dhritarashtra is blind. However, longing or passionate desire never disappears because of the lack of sight. If Surdas had thought of Dhritarashtra, he would not have pierced his eyes.
Surdas pierced his eyes in the belief that the desire and longing would never crop up once sight was destroyed.</description>

... Dweepam – and this is a special word in the buddhist tradition.
Buddha says to his disciples again and again ‘Become an island’ – and by that he means to remain in your aloneness totally. Just like an island unconnected to anything, just you yourself in your absolute aloneness – then you become an island.</description>

Okay.
My okay is a little sad because Ashu is sad, and the membership of this Noah’s Ark is so small that just one person being sad is enough to change the whole atmosphere. She is sad because her lover is gone and may not be back.
Do you remember a few days ago I asked her, “Where is your love, Ashu?</description>

Nasim means the morning breeze, just before the sunrise – that particular breeze. It is a metaphor for purity, freshness, aliveness. And a man has to be that purity, that aliveness, that early morning freshness. Only through that freshness can God be contacted. People are very very dusty: they go on gathering dust, they are dust collectors.</description>

Your Honor, before I take the oath, I have to say few things, otherwise the oath will be a fraud. The first thing – I have always been against the ritual of oath-taking for the simple reason that if a man is capable fo lying he can lie even while he is taking the oath.</description>

Anand Gopi. Anand means bliss. Gopi is a very significant word; it comes from the tradition of the devotee.
There are two paths: one is of knowledge, wisdom, meditation, and the other is that of love, devotion, surrender. The word “gopi” belongs to the other tradition, the tradition of surrender. Literally Gopi means the beloved of God.</description>

Wajid. Wajid is a sufi name for God. It means: one who has no needs, one who is fulfilled, contented. Fulfilment is another name for God. Unless one becomes God one remains unfulfilled. Dissolving into God is disappearing from the world of needs. Then one simply is and all is good. Then whatsoever happens is blissful: life is blissful, death too.</description>

Prem means love, and anjana literally means ‘eye ointment’ – love, the eye ointment: because love gives you new vision. It cleanses your eyes of the old, makes available to you the present and the future. It transforms your eyesight. In fact, it gives you eyes, otherwise one is blind. So anjana means an ointment that can restore the sight of a blind man.</description>

Anand means blissful, sudheer means wisdom. And I make it a condition that wisdom is significant only when it is blissful, and blissfulness is meaningful only when it has wisdom in it. Both can exist separately but then they are not meaningful.
A person can be very happy and foolish – maybe happy because he is foolish, maybe happy because he cannot understand the complexity of life, because he is below understanding so he is not aware that misery is implied in life.</description>

THE DIFFERENCE is immense – it is absolutely unbridgeable. Two things will have to be understood: one is personality and the second is individuality.
We ordinarily don’t have individuality at all. That’s what Gurdjieff means when he says it is very rare to find a person who has a soul.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
6 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Madhuma means absolutely sweet – that’s the taste of god. Buddha is reported to have said: Truth is sweet in the beginning, in the middle, in the end; truth is sweet all over. If it feels bitter to us, and sometimes it does, that simply shows that we have become too accustomed to the lies.</description>

6 February 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Shanti means peace, bhadra means grace – peace and grace, peace that comes through grace. There are two types of peace possible: one that man can cultivate – that is not of much meaning; the other that comes from god as a gift, that which cannot be cultivated; that is real peace.
So remember it: one can cultivate peace and look peaceful, and may not be peaceful.</description>

Prem means love; leon is Latin, it means lion, or lionlike.
Love is the greatest courage, because it needs total sacrifice. It wants you to die so that you can be reborn. It is a death and the beginning of an eternal life; but death is first, hence the courage needed. One has to be really lionlike, ready to take the risk.</description>

Rick Atmo. Rick means a powerful ruler, atmo means your own self. One can rule others or one can rule oneself. To rule others is a poor substitute, because the real ruler is one who rules himself. Because it is arduous to rule oneself, people have chosen the cheaper thing; the cheaper thing is to rule others.</description>

6 January 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anurago means pure love, with no desire, with no expectation, with no idea of any return. Then love is pure, then love is god. And the more you give, the more you become capable of giving: it is an inexhaustible source in your being.
Empty yourself in love, and when you have emptied yourself in love, in that space god descends in you.</description>

THE SPRING still comes. It does not depend whether you are sitting silently or fretfully, whether you are sitting or not sitting at all. It does not depend on you; it comes on its own accord.</description>

It is necessary that some matters be understood. First, it is necessary to know that from a scientific point of view the whole solar family is born out of the sun. The moon, Mars, Jupiter, and the rest of the planets, including this earth, are all organic parts of the sun. Slowly, life on earth came into being – from plants to man.</description>

This is a significant question for all those who are interested in meditation, because meditation is really a transcending of the process of dreaming. You are constantly dreaming – not only in the night, not only while you are asleep; you are dreaming the whole day.</description>

Discipline And Control
26 June 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO ATTAIN NEED DISCIPLINE AND EFFORT AT FIRST. IS THAT NOT A THING OF THE EGO, AND WILL IT NOT BECOME MORE STRENGTHENED? I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HARD ON MYSELF AND MISSED MUCH OF THE JOYS OF LIFE. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Divine Dictator
6 October 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine and suraj means order: divine order. To be in that state one has to be possessed by god. One has to lose oneself more and more, one’s ideas, one’s mind, one’s manipulations, one’s control.
There can be two orders in a human being. Either man orders himself – he is his own government – or god becomes his government and he simply follows.</description>

‌So the sage gives you a well-formulated eightfold path. He says, &#34;This is the way.&#34; One day, when you will really be awake... And remember, these things help you to awake. Now even if you stand on your head in a dream there is a possibility your dream will be broken. Try! Try tonight! When you are in a dream, just stand on your head in the dream, and suddenly you will see that you are awake.</description>

Don’t just accept: rejoice!
24 December 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS TOTAL ACCEPTANCE?
Milarepa, the very word total acceptance has somewhere in it the shadow of non-acceptance. Total acceptance has been preached because people are living in total rejection; whatever happens to them, they are bound to find something wrong in it.
It is something very important to understand that all our so-called religious qualities are reactions.</description>

Encountering the Unconscious
20 February 1972 pm in Bombay, India
Question 1
CONSIDERING THE EXAMPLE OF SENSUAL INSTINCT, KINDLY EXPLAIN WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL WAYS TO ENCOUNTER THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND, AND HOW CAN ONE KNOW THAT ONE HAS BECOME FREE FROM IT?
THE UNCONSCIOUS is not really unconscious. Rather, it is only less conscious. So the difference between conscious and unconscious is not of polar opposites, but of degrees.</description>

The original face of every child is the face of God. Of course my God is not a Christian, a Hindu, a Jew. My God is not even a person but only a presence.</description>

ARE THEY NOT DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF THE SAME TRUTH?

1 January 1986 am in Kathmandu, Nepal
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GNOSTICISM AND ANARCHY?
The word ‘anarchism’ has tremendous implications.
It means that the people are so inwardly disciplined that they don’t need any government. They are so deeply in order within themselves that no order outside is needed.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
DOES THE REBEL BELONG TO ANY CATEGORY?
Maneesha, the rebel by his very nature cannot belong to any existent categories; he is a new category. He introduces a new man into the world. He is a herald of a new dawn, a new beginning. No category of the past can contain him; all the categories that have existed up to now have proved either failures, or insufficient to change the whole of humanity.</description>

It is precisely because of that. Tao is so vast that one is afraid to lose one’s identity in it. We are like dewdrops and Tao is like an ocean.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
THE MONK, KANKEI, ONCE VISITED THE NUN, MASSAN RYONEN. HE SAID TO HIMSELF, “IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT, I WILL REMAIN THERE. IF IT DOESN’T I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!”
HE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, “HAVE YOU COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?</description>

‌somebody else&#39;s pocket; the money is in the pocket -- that&#39;s all. It is not a great loss in any way.
But the people without experience who are pretending to be masters are really harming you spiritually. They are giving you words which are dead -- they mean nothing -- and they are preventing you from finding the right man. When there are so many fake people, the greater is the possibility that you will get caught by some fake person.</description>

When I roam the lofty mountains I feel like my soul is raised on high and covered like the peaks in never melting caps of snow. And when I descend into the valleys I feel deep and profound like them and my heart fills with mysterious shadows. The same thing happens at the edge of the sea. There I merge with the surging waves; they pound and roar within me.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY CAN A MAN NOT BECOME MEDITATIVE? HOW CAN A MOVEMENT FOR MEDITATION BE CREATED?
Meditation is a danger, it is a risk.
It is a danger to all the vested interests, and it is a risk to the mind.
Mind and meditation cannot co-exist. There is no question of having both of them.</description>

You cannot seek the divine, it cannot be sought after, because you can seek only that which you know already. Seeking means desiring and you cannot seek something that is unknown. How can you seek something that you have not known at all? The very urge to seek comes only after you have tasted something, known something – even a glimpse.</description>

Religious Scriptures: History or Myth?
Date Unknown
Question
MANY WESTERN HISTORIANS FEEL THAT HUMANITY IS CONSTANTLY MAKING PROGRESS. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THEN HOW IS IT THAT HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS SO UNEVOLVED?
The progress of humanity and the progress of human consciousness are two quite different dimensions. The progress of history is in time and the progress of consciousness is not in time.</description>

Renunciation: mortgage today for a tomorrow that never comes
4 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
IS THERE REALLY ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE FOR RENUNCIATION IN YOUR RELIGION? THE QUESTION ARISES BECAUSE SINCE I CAME IN CONTACT WITH YOU, MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE HAVE DROPPED AWAY. I CANNOT EVEN RELATE TO MY OLD SELF.
THERE is really absolutely no place for renunciation in my religion.</description>

OUR BELOVED MASTER, MANZAN SAID:
THE ULTIMATE WAY IS THE ONE REAL GREAT WAY. THE MIND OF FAITH IS THE NON- DUALISTIC, INCONCEIVABLE MIND.
MIND AND THE WAY DO NOT DECREASE WHEN IN ILLUSION, NOR INCREASE WHEN IN ENLIGHTENMENT; EVERYTHING IS PERFECT REALITY, EACH PARTICULAR IS COMPLETE – YOU CAN’T GRASP OR REJECT ANYTHING.</description>

Self energy from sex energy
14 November 1970 am in
Life can be viewed in two ways in all its layers. Life has two aspects – one is material, and the other is spiritual. It is necessary to examine sex also from these two directions. One aspect of sex is biological which is linked with the body and its particles. The other is of energy, of soul which is linked with the mind by consciousness.</description>

A few things about sannyasThe oldest concept of sannyas was very life-negative, it was utterly
against life, but my idea of concept is absolutely life-affirmative. Nothing has to be dropped, everything has to be transformed. All that is available is immensely valuable: anything denied will never allow you to be whole, and if you are not whole you can never be holy.</description>

26 October 1974 am in Buddha Hall
TO LIVE IN THE GREAT WAY IS NEITHER EASY NOR DIFFICULT, BUT THOSE WITH LIMITED VIEWS ARE FEARFUL AND IRRESOLUTE:
THE FASTER THEY HURRY, THE SLOWER THEY GO, AND CLINGING CANNOT BE LIMITED; EVEN TO BE ATTACHED TO THE IDEA OF ENLIGHTENMENT IS TO GO ASTRAY.
JUST LET THINGS BE IN THEIR OWN WAY AND THERE WILL BE NEITHER COMING NOR GOING.</description>

OSHO, WHY IS GROWTH PAINFUL?
Growth is painful because you have been avoiding a thousand and one pains in your life. By avoiding you cannot destroy them – they go on accumulating. You go on swallowing your pains; they remain in your system. That’s why growth is painful – when you start growing, when you decide to grow, you have to face all the pains that you have repressed.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
HOW DID WE WHO LOVE YOU LET THIS UGLINESS HAPPEN TO YOUR VISION AND TO OURSELVES? I SAW THINGS I THOUGHT WERE UGLY. I’D TELL MYSELF, “THE MASTER MUST WANT IT THIS WAY. I DON’T SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. I DON’T WANT TO BE NEGATIVE.”

CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY DREAMS?
We have seven bodies: the physical, the etheric, the astral, the mental, the spiritual, the cosmic, and the nirvanic. Each body has its own type of dream. The physical body is known in Western psychology as the conscious, the etheric body as the unconscious, and the astral body as the collective unconscious.</description>

WHEN THE RIGHT TIME COMES, THE BUDDHA-NATURE WILL MANIFEST ITSELF. DOGEN CONTINUED:
MANY MONKS, BOTH PAST AND PRESENT, HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE PHRASE, “WHEN THE RIGHT TIME COMES,” MEANS TO WAIT FOR THE BUDDHA-NATURE TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE FUTURE.</description>

Premananda,
Existence is nameless. We are all nameless, but the name has a certain utility; without it life will be impossible. When the child is born he comes as a nobody, as pure nothingness – that’s the beauty of a child – but it is a necessity that he should be given a name.</description>

It is impossible, absolutely impossible to have an original thought.

MY HUMBLE ADVICE TO YOU DISTINGUISHED PERSONS WHO STUDY THE PROFOUND MYSTERY OF THE BUDDHA-DHARMA IS THIS: YOUR CLOSE EXAMINATION OF YOURSELF MUST BE AS URGENT AS SAVING YOUR OWN HEAD WERE IT ABLAZE; YOUR EFFORTS TO PENETRATE INTO YOUR OWN ORIGINAL NATURE MUST BE AS TIRELESS AS THE PURSUIT OF AN INDISPENSABLE THING; YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE VERBAL TEACHINGS OF THE BUDDHAS AND PATRIARCHS MUST BE AS HOSTILE AS THAT TOWARD A DEADLY ENEMY.</description>

Wait and you shall find
7 August 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
FOR YEARS YOU HAVE TALKED TO US OF SIMPLICITY: SIMPLICITY IN LOVE, THE SIMPLICITY OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND NOW THE SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THE POWER GAME BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA. WHY HAS MAN DEVELOPED SUCH COMPLEXITY, AND WHY DOES HE SHOW SUCH MISTRUST AND DISBELIEF IN THE SIMPLE?</description>

Wake up, Lazarus!
6 July 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
DID JESUS REALLY CALL BACK LAZARUS FROM DEATH?
The function of the master is precisely that: to call the disciples to the real life – ordinarily they are dead. Ordinarily you only appear to be alive; don’t be deceived by the appearance. You function like a robot, efficiently, but it is not life.</description>

THE UGLY ONE HE VALUED, AND THE BEAUTIFUL ONE HE NEGLECTED. WHEN YANG CHU ASKED THE REASON, THE FELLOW ANSWERED: THE BEAUTIFUL ONE THINKS HERSELF BEAUTIFUL, AND I DO NOT NOTICE HER BEAUTY; THE UGLY ONE THINKS HERSELF UGLY, AND I DO NOT NOTICE HER UGLINESS.</description>

TOKUSAN WAS STUDYING ZEN UNDER RYUTAN. ONE NIGHT TOKUSAN CAME TO RYUTAN AND ASKED MANY QUESTIONS.
THE TEACHER SAID, “THE NIGHT IS GETTING OLD – WHY DON’T YOU RETIRE?”
SO TOKUSAN BOWED, AND AS HE OPENED THE SCREEN TO GO OUT HE OBSERVED, “IT IS VERY DARK OUTSIDE.”
RYUTAN OFFERED TOKUSAN A LIGHTED CANDLE TO FIND HIS WAY, BUT JUST AS TOKUSAN RECEIVED IT, RYUTAN BLEW IT OUT.</description>

30 September 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand Upale... Bliss is the object of our search...
The problem is that the more you seek it, the less you have it; everybody is seeking it, hence everybody is missing it. It is not something to be sought, it is not something that can be sought, it cannot be made a goal. For certain intrinsic reasons bliss is irreducible to a goal, because the goal is in the future and bliss is always in the present.</description>

7 May 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Marian means rebellion and grace. Mary means rebellion; Ann is part of Hannah, it means grace. Your full name will mean love, rebellion, grace.
Love is rebellion and love is grace too. Love is rebellion because it is the expression of your innermost core. It is not imitation, it is not being a carbon copy; it is your originality.</description>

7 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, Mudra has many meanings. The most fundamental meaning is gesture, the literal meaning is gesture. God happens in a certain gesture, in a certain state of mind, in a certain state of body when everything is in tune and all is harmonious, when there is no conflict within and no fragmentation either.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
19 February 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, and siddhanta means principle – principle of love. And that’s the principle of life also.
Love is life, and there is no life except love, mm? So become more and more loving, trusting – without any conditions. If one loses everything in love, nothing is lost. And if one can save everything and love is lost, then everything is lost.</description>

Question BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAY THAT THE LOVE BETWEEN A LOVER AND HIS BELOVED CAN BE LASTING, BUT NOT THAT BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND WIFE. BUT YESTERDAY YOU DESCRIBED THE LOVE BETWEEN RAMA AND SITA AS SO TOTAL THAT THEY WERE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE.</description>

[NOTE: This was published in THE RAJNEESH TIMES, 26th October 1984 while Osho was in silence.]
Q: THIS MORNING SOME JOURNALISTS ASKED, “WHY DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A RELIGION?”
Osho: Ours is the only religion, first religion in the history of the world. All other religions were only experiments that failed. So not only say to them that we are a religion, say to them that we are the only religion.</description>

7 June 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Dharma Farrell. Dharma means religion; Farrell means a man of courage.
Religion is possible only through courage, but usually the cowardly become religious. The temples, the churches, the mosques, are full of cowards. Their God is nothing but a projection of their fear; their prayer is nothing but a demand for protection. It is a kind of bribe.</description>

11 May 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Alima. It is a sufi name for God. It means: one who knows. Only God knows and unless we become one with God there is no knowing. All else that we think is knowledge is just trivia, rubbish – at the most information, but not knowledge. And the difference is great: to know means to know from the inside; information means to collect something from the outside.</description>

[A visitor said that while he was very happy to be here, he was missing his girlfriend.
Osho said that it was good in a love relationship for lovers to sometimes be apart so an appetite arose to be together.]
In fact the very word ‘love’ simply means to desire. You may not be aware but the word ‘love’ comes from a sanskrit root; the word is not basically english.</description>

When all the three are involved, utterly involved, then only does one know what love is. Before that knowing, all is dreaming.</description>

To remain aware of just this is meditation – watching it, observing it, with no condemnation, with no evaluation, just remaining like a mirror. And slowly slowly the mind disappears, because the mind can live only in the past and through the past, or in the future and through the future.</description>

Love is love only when it is pure, when there is no other motive in it, when it is just itself, when it is not caused by anything, when it is not a means for something else but the end itself. Love is pure when it has an intrinsic value, when it serves no purpose but is a joy unto itself, when it is a simple overflowing exultation, when it is not part of the world of business – motive, profit, gain, goal – when it is so simple like a rose flower, exulting, exuberant, overflowing, for no other reason, for no reason at all.</description>

I HAVE STILLED MY RESTLESS MIND, AND MY HEART IS RADIANT:

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I CAN’T CONCEIVE OF YOU EVER BEING UNENLIGHTENED. DID YOU REALLY BECOME ENLIGHTENED ONLY THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO?
Neither can I conceive it. This is one of the very fundamental things in the nature of enlightenment. Once you are enlightened, you are in a very strange situation – trying to conceive how you could manage to remain unenlightened for so many lives.</description>

Deva means divine, madhukar means honey bee. And it is a very very pregnant symbol in the East – the honey bee. It represents freedom. It never becomes attached to any flower; it simply goes from one flower to another, collecting honey. But it is never attached, it remains unattached.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE STATE OF BARDO AS DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT TIBETAN SCRIPTURES. COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?
Bardo is a simple method but with great significance. Only people who have meditated a little bit in their lives can be benefited by it, and Tibet was one of the countries where almost everybody was devoting some time to meditation – just to be alone, silent, not doing anything, just witnessing.</description>

PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SELF-INTEREST BRINGS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURUSHA SEPARATED FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF OTHERS.

Il. 22. man tu par utar kanh jaiho
TO WHAT SHORE WOULD YOU CROSS, O MY HEART? THERE IS NO TRAVELER BEFORE YOU, THERE IS NO ROAD.

[A sannyasin who is leaving says she is afraid she will forget Osho.]
You will not slip back... and you will not forget me; don’t be worried. But the fear comes to everybody. It is natural. Here you live in a different climate: for twenty-four hours you are thinking of me, remembering me.</description>

17 February 1976 am in Buddha Hall
THE MASTER FOSO HOYEN SAID: ’THEY SAY THAT BUDDHA UTTERED FIVE THOUSAND AND FORTY-EIGHT TRUTHS DURING HIS LIFETIME. THEY INCLUDE THE TRUTH OF EMPTINESS AND THE TRUTH OF BEING. THEY INCLUDE THE TRUTH OF SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT AND THE TRUTH OF GRADUAL ENLIGHTENMENT. ARE NOT ALL THESE YEA-SAYINGS?
‘BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOKA, IN THE “SONG OF ENLIGHTENMENT” SAYS THERE ARE NO BEINGS AND NO BUDDHAS – SAGES ARE SEA-BUBBLES, AND GREAT MINDS ARE ONLY FLICKERINGS OF LIGHTNING.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE BEEN ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS: ‘IS THERE SOME POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER JONESTOWN IN YOUR COMMUNE?’

Live one day as a buddha
31 July 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER, DOGEN WROTE:
PRACTICE IS IDENTICAL WITH EXPRESSION, AND VICE VERSA. TO EXPRESS THE WAY ALL DAY IS TO PRACTICE THE WAY ALL DAY. IN OTHER WORDS, WE PRACTICE SOMETHING IMPRACTICABLE AND EXPRESS SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLE .…
EACH DAY’S LIFE SHOULD BE ESTEEMED; THE BODY SHOULD BE RESPECTED.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Love and centering: one phenomenon
6 December 1986 pm in
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN TO BE IN LOVE AND STILL CENTERED?
The question has many implications.
First, you do not understand what being centered means.
Second, you also have no experience of the phenomenon of love. I can say this with absolute authority, because your question supplies all the evidence for what I am saying.</description>

21 September 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
LAST MONTH I WAS FACED WITH A RECOGNITION THAT WHERE THERE IS LIGHT THERE IS ALSO A SHADOW SIDE OF DARKNESS. YET UNTIL THE LAST FEW DAYS I STILL CLUNG TO THE ILLUSION OF SOME SEPARATION BETWEEN THEM, IN PARTICULAR THAT HERE ON THE RANCH WITH YOU THERE WAS LIGHT, AND OUTSIDE THERE WAS DARKNESS.</description>

Love possesses not
11 January 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
LOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF. LOVE POSSESSES NOT NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;
FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT UNTO LOVE.
WHEN YOU LOVE YOU SHOULD NOT SAY, “GOD IS IN MY HEART,” BUT RATHER, “I AM IN THE HEART OF GOD.”
AND THINK NOT YOU CAN DIRECT THE COURSE OF LOVE, FOR LOVE, IF IT FINDS YOU WORTHY, DIRECTS YOUR COURSE.</description>

Question 1
QUESTIONER: YOU SAY THAT MARRIAGE IS IMMORAL. AND HERE IS KRISHNA WHO PERHAPS GOES FOR THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MARRIAGES IN HISTORY. IS HE GUILTY OF ENCOURAGING THE IMMORALITY WHICH MARRIAGE IS?
I say marriage is immoral, but I don’t say marrying is immoral. A man and a woman in love with each other would like to live together, so a marriage stemming from love will not be immoral.</description>

Jaya means inner victory, conquering oneself, and ananda means bliss – bliss that comes out of conquering oneself. And that is the only bliss there is. You can conquer the whole world and you will remain miserable; of course your misery will become a thousand-fold – the misery of an alexander is bound to be tremendous.</description>

ONE DAY AN ANGEL, FLYING BACK TO HEAVEN, SAW BELOW HIM A LUXURIANT FOREST ENVELOPED IN A GREAT, GLOWING HALO OF LIGHT. HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE SKY MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE, HE NATURALLY HAD SEEN NUMEROUS LAKES, MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS, BUT HAD NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THEM. TODAY, HOWEVER, HE NOTICED SOMETHING DIFFERENT – A FOREST SURROUNDED BY A RADIANT AURA, FROM WHICH BEAMS OF LIGHT RADIATED TO EVERY PART OF THE FIRMAMENT.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE WE MOVING INTO THE SOCRATIC DIALOGUE FORM OF DISCOURSES NOW?
BUT I DETECT AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE. SOCRATES SAID: “KNOW THYSELF.” YOU HAVE SAID: “LET GO THYSELF!”
PLEASE COMMENT.
Maneesha, the subject of Socratic dialogue is something special to be discussed. His use of the word ‘dialogue’ was very original; he means by it that truth can be discovered by discussing in a friendly way, respectful towards each other.</description>

OSHO: IN ONE OF YOUR LECTURES ON SOCIALISM, ANSWERING SARJANO’S QUESTION, YOU INDICATED THAT THE PROLETARIAT WERE ‘THE LOWEST’.
IS THIS CONTRADICTORY TO CHRIST’S TEACHINGS ON THE POOR AS BEING THE CHILDREN OF GOD AND THE RICH AS BEING ‘THE LOWEST’?
DURING YEARS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT WORK WITH POOR PEASANTS IN LATIN AMERICA, I FOUND THEM TO BE ‘HIGHER’ SPIRITUALLY THAN THE RICH LANDLORDS.</description>

Tantric meditation with light techniques
31 March 1973 pm in Bombay, India
CONSIDER YOUR ESSENCE AS LIGHT RAYS FROM CENTER TO CENTER UP THE VERTEBRAE, AND SO RISES “LIVINGNESS” IN YOU.
OR IN THE SPACES BETWEEN, FEEL THIS AS LIGHTNING.
FEEL THE COSMOS AS A TRANSLUCENT EVER-LIVING PRESENCE.
Man can be considered in three ways: in terms of the normal, the abnormal and the supernormal.</description>

Tantric path to super energy

Tantra is a philosophy of nonduality. It accepts life in its totality – even the wicked, the inauspicious, the darkness. Tantra accepts them not with a view to treat darkness as darkness or to treat bad as bad or to treat inauspicious as inauspicious, but because there is a possibility of transforming inauspicious into auspicious.</description>

The most fundamental thing to understand is that materialism is dead, that matter no longer exists. All that exists is energy.
The energy in a rock is the lowest form, the most dormant, the most closed, most asleep. Then there is the world of plants, trees.</description>

The Treasure which Endures
27 August 1974 am in Buddha Hall
THE SEVENTH SAYING
JESUS SAID: THE KINGDOM OF THE FATHER IS LIKE A MAN, A MERCHANT, WHO POSSESSED MERCHANDISE AND FOUND A PEARL.
THE MERCHANT WAS PRUDENT. HE SOLD THE MERCHANDISE AND BOUGHT THE ONE PEARL FOR HIMSELF.
DO YOU ALSO SEEK FOR THE TREASURE WHICH FAILS NOT, WHICH ENDURES, WHERE NO MOTH COMES NEAR TO DEVOUR AND WHERE NO WORM DESTROYS.</description>

The True Master: The Ultimate Rebel
2 January 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
YOU ARE SHOWERING IMMENSE LOVE ON YOUR DISCIPLES AND OTHERS. BUT WHY AREN’T OTHER ENLIGHTENED BEINGS LIKE YOU, SO FULL OF LOVE AND COMPASSION? IS IT NOT TRUE THAT LOVE AND COMPASSION DAWN WITH ENLIGHTENMENT?
WHY DO OTHER MASTERS SEEM TO BE SO DRY AND MERE INTELLECTUALS IN COMPARISON WITH YOU?</description>

The upward Flow of the Mind
21 February 1972 pm in Bombay, India
UNMANI BHAAVAH PADDYAM
THE UPWARD FLOW OF THE MIND IS PADDYAM – THE WATER OF DIVINE WORSHIP.
THE MIND is the bridge between matter and consciousness, between without and within, between the gross and the subtle. When I say mind is the bridge, I mean many things. Man comes to the world through mind; man comes to the body through mind; man comes to desires through mind.</description>

19. THE MIND IS NOT SELF-ILLUMINATING, BECAUSE IT IS ITSELF PERCEPTIBLE.

Total Education
21 January 1968 am in Poddar College
This discourse was given to teachers at Poddar College.
Of the misfortunes that have befallen mankind, the greatest are the ones which we have been regarding as blessings. Because of regarding them as benedictions, as blessings, it has not been possible to avoid those misfortunes, or to change them, and nothing has been done to be free of them; rather, on the contrary, we have been watering them at their roots.</description>

Toward the Silence of the Innermost Center
7 July 1972 pm in
NISCHALATWAM PRADAKSHINAM
“STILLNESS IS PRADAKSHINA, THE MOVEMENT AROUND THAT FOR WORSHIP.”
SILENCE is meditation and silence is basic for any religious experience. What is silence? You can create it, you can cultivate it, you can force it, but then it is just superficial, false, pseudo. You carl practise it, and you will begin to feel and experience it – but your practice makes it auto-hypnotic.</description>

Your ego is the distance between you and me

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE’S QUESTIONS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN EXPRESS THESE FEELINGS. I JUST CAN’T FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS MY TEARS OR MY LOVE, ALTHOUGH THE LONGING IS THERE. DO I NEED TO USE WORDS TO EXPOSE MYSELF?</description>

OUR BELOVED MASTER, BASUI SAID:
IF YOU WOULD FREE YOURSELF OF THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SIX REALMS, YOU MUST LEARN THE DIRECT WAY TO BECOME A BUDDHA. THIS WAY IS NO OTHER THAN THE REALIZATION OF YOUR OWN MIND.
NOW, WHAT IS THIS MIND? IT IS THE TRUE NATURE OF ALL SENTIENT BEINGS, THAT WHICH EXISTED BEFORE OUR PARENTS WERE BORN AND HENCE BEFORE OUR OWN BIRTH, AND WHICH PRESENTLY EXISTS, UNCHANGEABLE AND ETERNAL.</description>

Question 1
CAN YOU TELL US WHY, AS AN ADMIRER OF SOCRATES, YOU DON’T PRACTICE THE SOCRATIC METHOD OF DIALOGUE?
Dialogue is possible between two blind men; they can discuss ad infinitum about light without coming to any conclusion. Dialogue is impossible between two persons who can see light: the dialogue is unnecessary; light is the experience of both.</description>

Anand means bliss and divyo means divine – divine bliss. And that has to be remembered. I give you the name so it becomes unconsciously an undercurrent of remembrance – that wherever there is bliss, there is the divine.
Bliss is the manifestation of the element divine. So become more blissful if you want to become more God-full.</description>

8 February 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Bodhi means awareness, intelligence, meditativeness, enlightenment. It is one of the most potential words, it has many aspects to it. The word ‘buddha’ comes from bodhi; because he attained bodhi he is called Buddha. And that has to be your life’s work. Nothing less than that can ever satisfy a man.
Only in Buddhahood is there contentment; all other forms of contentment are just consolations, just comforts at the most, illusions created by the mind.</description>

Anand Mark. Anand means bliss. Linguistically bliss gives the idea of happiness, joy, pleasure, but existentially it is something higher than happiness, greater than joy, deeper than pleasure. All those three things – happiness, joy and pleasure – are part of it, but it is not just the sum total of them. The total is more than the sum total of all the parts.</description>

IT FEELS TO ME THAT MY BODY IS LIKE A CAGE OR BOTTLE, IN WHICH A VERY POWERFUL LION IS IMPRISONED AND HE HAS BEEN SLEEPING THERE FOR MANY LIVES, BUT NOW HE HAS BEEN AWAKENED BY YOUR HARASSMENT.</description>

Deva means divine, upeeksha literally means ‘indifference’, but in english there is no exact word for it. Indifference feels like something negative; upeeksha is something very positive.
It means a centering of consciousness so that you are not wavered by anything. Success comes, it is okay; failure comes, it is okay. That is called upeeksha.</description>

[Osho invites someone to take sannyas. He replies: I don’t know yet. I wait and see.]
But it is getting ready there; I can feel it in your heart, it is already there. There is no need to wait and see... be and see! That will be more relevant. How can you see from the outside?</description>

[A visitor said she had trouble becoming involved in the meditations here, adding that she could not stay much longer as she was a psychiatrist and had patients to see.]
A psychiatrist needs to be meditative more than anybody else – because your whole work is dangerous in a way. Unless you are very calm and quiet, unless you can remain unaffected by things that happen around you, it is very dangerous.</description>

8 July 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem Maryan. Prem means love; maryan is made of two words, mary and hannah. Mary means rebellion, hannah means prayer. Your full name will mean love, rebellion, prayer. That’s exactly my definition of the sannyasin: he has to be love, he has to be a rebel, and he has to be prayerful.
Love alone, without rebelliousness, is impotent.</description>

Deva means divine, sugito means a song, a divine song. Life can become a divine song, it has the potential but the potential is not yet actual; it has to be actualised. That is the work of sannyas: to help the potential to come to a realisation.
This is the most subtle art, because man is the most mysterious being on the earth.</description>

Uli Narayano. Uli means ruler of all, narayano is a name of God – God, the ruler of all. Only God can be the ruler of all; man tries but fails, is bound to fail. The very desire to become ruler of all is ugly. The desire to dominate is irreligious. The desire to be higher than others is the root cause of human misery.</description>

Shubha means good, virtuous; anand means blissful, happy – goodness and blissfulness. And virtue is virtue only when it brings happiness; if it brings sadness and seriousness then something has gone wrong. Then it is the worst kind of sin. And that’s what generally happens: it is very rare to find good and happy people.</description>

Deva means divine, viryo means life, energy – divine life energy. The divine is the hidden part of reality... the inner part of reality. The outer is visible; the inner is invisible. The outer is available through the senses; the inner is available only through consciousness. So those who depend only on the outer senses see reality on the circumference.</description>

Anand means bliss and hara is a japanese name for the centre just below the navel, two inches below the navel... and becoming aware of this centre is going to help you tremendously, so the more you abide there, the better.
Whenever you have nothing to do, just sit silently and move inside and fall into the stomach – just two inches below the navel – and remain there.</description>

8 December 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, sambhavo means potential. Love is not an actuality, it is only a seed, and the seed can die without ever becoming the actual. That’s the risk of life: every man is born with a possibility but it is only a possibility – it may be actualised, it may be missed. If it is missed then life remains futile, meaningless, a tale told by an idiot, full of fury and noise signifying nothing – because love is the significance, love is the meaning.</description>

[Osho gave a new sannyasin the name ‘deva sarvahara’ – saying that the meaning was ‘one who has lost all’.
Osho said that Jesus’ saying – ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit’ – meant that those who had nothing, who were nothing, were blessed. This did not imply that one should live an impoverished life; one should live beautifully, but one should not be possessed by one’s belongings.</description>

Anand means bliss, the ultimate state of consciousness where no content exists, not even a ripple of experience. Where all experiences have been dissolved, where only the experiencer is without any experience, that state is of bliss. There is no happiness, no unhappiness, because they are all experiences, they come from the outside. They are all disturbances.</description>

Anand means bliss, and Francis represents a few things. One: the childlike quality, and that is the most fundamental requirement for going into truth. The knowledgeable never enters; he goes round and round. Only the wondering heart can penetrate to the core of reality, only innocent eyes can see truth. The more learned one is, the less is the possibility of knowing: the more knowledge there is, the less knowing.</description>

A Certain Milieu
18 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY DO YOU GIVE SANNYAS TO BABIES AND CHILDREN?
Sannyas can be given only to babies and children. The very idea of being an adult is a barrier. The adult mind is an adulterated mind. It is already corrupt.
The physical age is irrelevant. Somebody may be seventy years old and yet a baby, and somebody may be young and may not be innocent.</description>

So many things will have to be taken into account. Firstly, to think of God as the creator is to divide reality into two: the creator and the created.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Beyond mother’s knees
8 May 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THREE MEN MADE THEIR WAY TO THE CIRCLE OF A SUFI, SEEKING ADMISSION TO HIS TEACHINGS. ALMOST AT ONCE ONE OF THEM DETACHED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUP, ANGERED BY THE ERRATIC BEHAVIOR OF THE MASTER.
ON THE MASTER’S INSTRUCTIONS, THE SECOND WAS TOLD BY A DISCIPLE THAT THE SAGE WAS A FRAUD.</description>

Bhuribai
11 September 1980 pm in Osho Commune International, India
Translated from: JYUN THA TYUN THARAYA. Published in OTI 16 August 1991.
Bhuribai is very closely connected with me. I have come to know thousands of men, thousands of women, but Bhuribai was unique among them.
Bhuribai’s mahaparinirvana – her death attaining the highest liberation – happened just recently. Count her with Meera, Rabiya, Sahajo, Daya – she is qualified to be among these few selected women.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, ALVIN TOFFLER WROTE A BOOK CALLED FUTURE SHOCK. IN IT HE DESCRIBED HOW THE WORLD AROUND US IS CHANGING FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND NOT ONLY THAT: THE RATE OF CHANGE IS INCREASING ALL THE TIME. HE DESCRIBES HOW HALF OF ALL AMERICANS CHANGE HOMES AT LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS; HOW PEOPLE CHANGE HUSBANDS, WIVES, JOBS, CITIES AND CAREERS WITH INCREASING RAPIDITY.</description>

18 February 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
HOW CAN I FEEL LIFE FRESH DAY BY DAY? PLEASE EXPLAIN.
LIFE is fresh but you are stale, and you become stale because you go on carrying the yesterdays. The past functions as a barrier between you and life.
Die every moment to the past and then life can be felt and lived as fresh as it is.</description>

“WHO ARE YOU?” HYAKUJO ASKED. “REIYU,” REPLIED ISAN.

12 December 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[The previous night of December 11th was Osho’s Birthday Celebration Darshan, which was open to everyone. There was singing and dancing in his silent presence.]
Deva means divine, nirvesham means delight.And all delight is divine. Pleasure is not divine –
delight is always divine. And the distinction between pleasure and delight has to be under-stood.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN THESE TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY, THE BEST – AND THE WORST – SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT IN THOSE OF US WHO ARE AROUND YOU. WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THIS?
There are no “times of uncertainty” because time is always uncertain. It is the difficulty with the mind: mind wants certainty – and time is always uncertain.</description>

There are no degrees of enlightenment. Once it is, it is there. It is just like jumping into an ocean of feeling. You jump, you become one with it, like a drop dropping into the ocean becomes one with it. But that doesn’t mean that you have known the whole ocean.
The moment is total: the moment of dropping the ego - the moment of ego elimination, the moment of egolessness - is total; it is complete.</description>

HOW CAN THE IDEA OF MERITOCRACY BE PRACTICALLY REALIZED?
ONE thing is absolutely certain: The days of the politicians are over. They have done too well their job of being destructive, violent.
They have come to a point where humanity has to decide either to die remaining with the politicians, to commit a global suicide, or to throw out the politicians and save humanity, civilization, culture, life.</description>

God is existence itself
DOES GOD EXIST? HOW CAN THERE BE SO MUCH EVIL AND CORRUPTION IN THE WORLD IF GOD EXISTS?
God is a mythical word, a mumbo-jumbo word that is the invention of the priesthood. Actually, to ask whether God exists is absurd. For those who know, God is existence, or existence is God.
Things exist, not God. A chair exists because a chair can go into nonexistence.</description>

THIS IS A WRONG QUESTION, basically meaningless. One should never jump ahead of oneself: there is every possibility that you will fall on your face. One should ask the basic question, one should begin at the beginning. My suggestion is: ask a more basic question.</description>

He Alone Wins who does not Want to Win
29 September 1970 am in
Question 1
QUESTIONER: KRISHNA’S LIFE, PARTICULARLY HIS CHILDHOOD, IS FULL OF STORIES OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM. HE KILLED THE TYRANT KIND KANSA AND DESTROYED DEMONS LIKE KIRTI, AGHA, BAKA AND GHOTAKA; IN A DUEL HE DEFEATED POWERFUL WRESTLERS LIKE CHANOOR AND MUSTIKA. HE SUBDUED A VERY VENOMOUS SNAKE KNOWN AS KALIA, AND PUT OUT A WHOLE FOREST FIRE SINGLE-HANDED.</description>

Holidays are not for saints
31 October 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER,
RINZAI SAID, “I EXPOUND THE DHARMA OF MIND-GROUND, BY WHICH ONE CAN ENTER THE SECULAR AND THE SACRED. BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOUR REAL AND TEMPORAL, SECULAR AND SACRED CAN ATTACH A NAME TO EVERYTHING REAL AND TEMPORAL, SECULAR AND SACRED. THEY CANNOT ATTACH A NAME TO THIS MAN.</description>

2 September 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE?
Pritam,
MY MESSAGE IS VERY SIMPLE Live life as dangerously as possible. Live life totally, intensely, passionately, because except for life there is no other God.
Friedrich Nietzsche says God is dead. That is wrong because God has never been there in the first place.</description>

WHAT EXACTLY IS INTELLIGENCE, AND WHAT IS THE RELATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE HEART TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MIND?
Punita, intelligence is the inborn capacity to see, to perceive. Every child is born intelligent, then made stupid by the society. We educate him in stupidity.</description>

WAITING FOR YOU TO GET WELL, THERE CAME A POINT WHERE I WASN’T WAITING ANYMORE FOR SOMETHING – IT SIMPLY BECAME JUST WAITING. DISCOVERING THE BEAUTY AND SWEETNESS OF IT WAS SO PRECIOUS. WAITING NEEDS NO PATIENCE. IT IS LIKE LIVING IN MOONLIGHT – A MYSTERIOUS QUIET JOY, SO NOURISHING AND RESTFUL, BECOMING A WOMB CONNECTED WITH YOU IN A CIRCULAR FLOW OF ENERGY.</description>

Christianity is certainly one of the most perverted of all religions, but it is nothing compared with Hinduism. Hinduism is the oldest religion in the world, and it has caused in its own way many perversions.</description>

And despair is the ordinary condition of humanity. People may know, may not know, but they are in despair. People are constantly in a turmoil, in an anxious state.

Deva means divine, and sarjan means creativity; divine creativity. And my attitude towards god is that he is not a creator but just pure creativity... just the energy, not a person.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONESELF WITHOUT FIRST LEARNING TO LOVE ONESELF?
It is absolutely impossible to be responsible for yourself unless you learn to love yourself. Every child is born with tremendous love for himself. It is the society that destroys that love, it is the religion that destroys that love – because if a child goes on growing in loving himself, who is going to love Jesus Christ?</description>

Of the despisers of the body and the joys and the passions
30 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
OF THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY
YOU SAY ‘I’ AND YOU ARE PROUD OF THIS WORD. BUT GREATER THAN THIS – ALTHOUGH YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IN IT – IS YOUR BODY AND ITS GREAT INTELLIGENCE, WHICH DOES NOT SAY ‘I’ BUT PERFORMS ‘I’.</description>

Off To Hell – Yo-Ho!
18 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE ZEN ATTITUDE TOWARDS DEATH?
LAUGHTER. Yes, laughter is the Zen attitude towards death. And towards life too, because life and death are not separate. Whatsoever is your attitude towards life will be your attitude towards death, because death comes as the ultimate flowering of life.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I FEEL THAT THROUGH DEVELOPING AN ATTITUDE OF ENDURANCE TOWARDS DIFFICULTIES, I HAVE BECOME RESIGNED TO MUCH OF LIFE.
THIS RESIGNATION FEELS LIKE A WEIGHT PUSHING AGAINST MY EFFORT TO BECOME MORE ALIVE IN MEDITATION.
DOES THIS MEAN THAT I HAVE SUPPRESSED MY EGO, AND THAT I MUST FIND IT AGAIN BEFORE I CAN REALLY LOSE IT?</description>

Question 1
OSHO, LAST NIGHT YOU EXPLAINED INNER STILLNESS THROUGH THE DIMENSION OF INNER SILENCE. PLEASE EXPLAIN INNER STILLNESS FROM SOME OTHER DIMENSION.
STILLNESS has many dimensions. One is silence: it is the polar opposite of sound; it is soundlessness. The second dimension is no-movement: it is the polar opposite of movement. Mind is movement just as mind is sound.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE DESCRIBE AN ORTHODOX RAJNEESHEE.
IT is a contradiction in terms, but I will not dispose of the question so easily. I will try to squeeze as much juice out of it as possible.
Yes, there is some way to define the orthodox Rajneeshee. It is going to be a strange definition because two terms which are contradictory to each other are used together.</description>

ARE THERE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEDONISM? I SUSPECT ‘EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY’ MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
Yes, Anurag. There are two levels of hedonism, and they are almost polar opposites to each other. Because of that, much misunderstanding has prevailed down the ages.
The lower hedonism is of the body, and the higher hedonism is of the soul.</description>

The Great Palace of Consciousness
8 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
CAN COWARDICE AND HYPOCRISY ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL? CAN I ACCEPT EVEN MY COWARDICE, MY HYPOCRISY, MY MISERLINESS AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS PRIVACY THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE CALLED “IDIOCY”? AND IF I ACCEPT SUCH TENDENCIES, ALL OF WHICH TEND TO BOTTLE ME UP, HOW WILL I GET FREE?</description>

THE Current OF 18TH DECEMBER HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. ABRAHAM T. KOVOOR, EIGHTY-YEAR-OLD RATIONALIST AND ATHEIST, OF CEYLON, IN WHICH HE REFERS TO AND CRITICIZES YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?
R. ABRAHAM T. KOVOOR seems to be a nice old man, but a little senile. Senile, I call him, because a person cannot be both together – a rationalist and an atheist.</description>

The Light of Disbelief
14 August 1969 pm
This discourse was given to students.
Just as an individual becomes old, the society also becomes old. Just as an individual dies, the society dies and civilizations also die, but no individual can refuse to become old or refuse to die. But a society, a civilization, can refuse to become old and to die if it so desires, although the society which refuses to die will cease to have a new life.</description>

The lion’s roar
22 October 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
ONCE JOSHU WAS ASKED, “WHAT IS THE SPECIAL TEACHING OF YOUR SCHOOL?”
JOSHU’S RESPONSE WAS, “THOUGH THE FOLDING SCREEN IS BROKEN, THE FRAME IS STILL THERE.”
AT ANOTHER TIME, THE SAME QUESTION WAS ASKED OF JOSHU, AND HE REPLIED, “ASK IN A LOUD VOICE – I’M HARD OF HEARING.”
WHEN THE MONK HAD REPEATED THE QUESTION IN A LOUD VOICE, JOSHU SAID, “YOU ASK ME MY SPECIAL TEACHING – I KNOW YOUR SPECIAL TEACHING.</description>

AND YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP ALL TYPES BUT YOU ALSO SAY THAT YOU ARE CONTRADICTORY ON PURPOSE, SO THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL GO AWAY.</description>

The only refuge is the perfection of wisdom, the perfection of meditation. In the past it has been so, in the present it is so, in the future it will be so. Anybody who becomes a Buddha becomes one through meditation.</description>

Life is based on polarity; everything exists with its polar opposite. Otherwise is not possible. Mind exists because of matter; mind is the polar opposite.</description>

HUI TZU SAID TO CHUANG TZU:
“ALL YOUR TEACHING IS CENTERED ON WHAT HAS NO USE.” CHUANG TZU REPLIED:
“IF YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HAS NO USE YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE USED. THE EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, IS BROAD AND VAST,
BUT OF ALL THIS EXPANSE A MAN USES ONLY A FEW INCHES UPON WHICH HE HAPPENS TO BE STANDING AT THE TIME.</description>

11 July 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Jayananda. It means victory and bliss... but this victory is something very paradoxical: it comes only when you stop desiring it; it comes only when you accept your utter defeat.
So there are two kinds of victories in the world: one is that which comes through desire, aggression, fight, mm?</description>

To become a Song is to become a Saint
8 August 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, astika means one who trusts, one who believes, one who trusts in bliss; and that’s my definition of a religious man. I don’t say to trust in god, because that is very far-fetched. God is very abstract – it is only a word; you don’t have any experience of it.</description>

WHAT DOES TANTRA MEAN BY PURITY?
One of the things being asked about is: WHAT DOES TANTRA MEAN BY PURIFICATION OF THE MIND, PURITY OF THE MIND, AS A BASIC CONDITION TO FURTHER PROGRESS? Whatsoever
is ordinarily meant by purity is not what is meant by tantra. Ordinarily, we divide everything into bad and good.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY ARE YOU SO WIDELY MISUNDERSTOOD?
It is the way of human progress. Whenever there is someone who says something against the tradition, against the establishment – political or religious – he is bound to be misunderstood. But that is not something new.
You can look as far back as possible and you will always find a few people being misunderstood.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
9 April 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho asks a sannyasin couple who is leaving when they will be coming back. The man answers: God knows... maybe fall.]
In the fall? Have you heard the famous Mulla Nasrudin story?
Mulla had saved up to buy a new shirt. He went to a tailor’s shop, full of excitement. The tailor measured him and said, ‘Come back in a week, and – if Allah wills – your shirt will be ready.</description>

15 April 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[To a sannyasin who said he was studying Yoga but had never done any groups, Osho recommended he do some groups, saying that otherwise Yoga could make one very repressed.]
Yoga is good, but something more is needed. Alone, it has crippled the whole country. This country has suffered too much.
It creates a very stiff, structured being.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, USA
Time cannot go back, but mind can. What a wastage – to give such a mind, which cannot forget anything whatsoever, to a man who not only has become a no-mind, but also preaches to others to drop the mind. As far as my mind is concerned – remember, my mind, not me – it is as much a mechanism as the one being used here.</description>

9 September 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho reminds someone who is leaving of the importance of meditating regularly so that it becomes one’s climate; then only does it go deep. Through whatever you do a subtle current of meditation has to continue; only then does meditation become a transformation. So by the time you come back the thread will be there; then higher planes can be made available to you, He reminds her.</description>

Yes, you can help them to do some dynamic types of meditations. That will help very much because mad people need nothing else but catharsis.</description>

[A sannyasin asks: Can you see where there’s something wrong with my feelings? – because up to now I have not been able to feel the energy.
Osho checks his energy.]
It will open – nothing to worry about. Just be here with no desire, not even the desire of opening the heart. Just be here with no motive, because every motive becomes a hindrance – even the motive to open.</description>

9 April 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Veeno means a musical instrument – a musical instrument of love. Man’s heart is a musical instrument, it contains great music. It is asleep but it is there, waiting for the right moment to be struck, to be expressed, to be sung, to be danced. And it is through love that that moment arrives.</description>

THERE IS A STORY FAMOUS IN THE UPANISHADS AND SOMETIMES MENTIONED BY YOU, OF TWO BIRDS, WHO LIVE TOGETHER ON THE SAME TREE. ONE EATS THE SWEET FRUITS OF THIS TREE, WHILE THE OTHER EATS NONE OF THE FRUITS AND REMAINS THERE WITNESSING.</description>

Veet Atito – beyond the past.…
The only problem that a seeker of truth has to encounter is the past. It is the past that stands between you and the reality; it is the past that functions as a barrier. It does not allow you to see that which is. It goes on interfering, distorting, interpreting.</description>

That’s true. That’s good christians have destroyed all bridges towards Christ. Christ needs a new interpretation, a new approach, a new breakthrough. Christ needs people now who are not christians; only they can relate with him.</description>

The first thing – you should not try to concentrate. Concentration is not going to help you at all. Concentration will create a tension in the mind. Relaxation is going to help – not concentration. There are two types of people: there are people who can be helped by concentration, and there are people who can be helped only through relaxation – and both processes are different.</description>

9 March 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, Laila is from a symbolic Sufi story. Sufis believe that god is the beloved, that god is the woman, and that the seeker is the lover.
The story of Laila and Majnu represents the seeker and the sought. Majnu is the seeker, Laila is the beloved; Laila represents god. It is one of the most beautiful stories, but it has lost its message.</description>

9 January 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Udgeya means that which has to be celebrated, that which has to be sung.
Life is a celebration, and unless one understands it as celebration one goes on missing god. To connect with the divine, the only bridge is celebration. It is only in the moments when you are utterly drunk with joy that you are close to god.</description>

21 January 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS EXISTENCE? IS IT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT PEOPLE CALL GOD?
Sampurna, existence is that which is, and God is that which is not. Existence is a reality, God is a fiction. Existence is available only to meditators, people of silence; God is a consolation for sick minds, sick psychologies.</description>

IF INDIA IS SUCH AN UNSPIRITUAL COUNTRY, WHY ARE SO MANY ENLIGHTENED BEINGS BORN HERE?
Spirituality is individual. It has nothing to do with the social, the collective. No society is spiritual, no nation is spiritual. There are spiritual beings – because there is no social soul, the soul manifests through the individual.</description>

Get in tune with the essence
30 May 1986 pm in Punta Del Este, Uruguay.
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT DEVOTEES I WAS VERY DEEPLY TOUCHED BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU: DEVOTION. IF THE PRICE OF ENLIGHTENMENT WERE TO STAY AWAY FROM YOUR PRESENCE, I WOULD GIVE IT UP GLADLY FOR THE BLISS AND CENTEREDNESS I FEEL RIGHT NOW JUST LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU SURE YOU WEREN’T BORN ENLIGHTENED? YOU SEEM TO HAVE LIVED YOUR WHOLE LIFE WITH SUCH CLARITY, COURAGE AND A COMMITMENT NEVER TO COMPROMISE YOUR INTEGRITY THAT IT SEEMS SOME QUALITY OF AWAKENING HAS BEEN WITH YOU ALL THE TIME. IF FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU WERE NOT ENLIGHTENED, WAS ANYTHING A SUFFERING FOR YOU?</description>

When I say that man is asleep, this has to be understood. We are dreaming continually, twenty-four hours a day. In the night we are closed to the outward world, dreaming inside. In the day our senses are opened toward the outside world, but the dream continues inside. Close your eyes for a moment, and you can again be in a dream; it is a continuity inside.</description>

IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY THE OTHER DAY, I CAN’T EVEN GO TO WORSHIP.
PLEASE COMMENT.

I TRUST YOU UNCONDITIONALLY, AND NOW I’M NO LONGER A SANNYASIN SIMPLY TO RID MYSELF OF MY FEARS. I AM NOW HERE WITHOUT ANY NEED, HOPE, DESIRE OR EXPECTATION. I AM NO LONGER FEELING DEPENDENT ON YOU. I AM WITH YOU WITHOUT ANY REASON, JUST FOR FUN, AND I TRUST YOU WITHOUT BELIEF.</description>

Neither this nor that
29 October 1974 am in Buddha Hall
IN THIS WORLD OF SUCHNESS THERE IS NEITHER SELF NOR OTHER-THAN-SELF.
TO COME DIRECTLY INTO HARMONY WITH THIS REALITY JUST SIMPLY SAY WHEN DOUBTS ARISE, “NOT TWO.”
IN THIS “NOT TWO” NOTHING IS SEPARATE, NOTHING IS EXCLUDED.
NO MATTER WHEN OR WHERE, ENLIGHTENMENT MEANS ENTERING THIS TRUTH.
AND THIS TRUTH IS BEYOND EXTENSION OR DIMINUTION IN TIME OR SPACE; IN IT A SINGLE THOUGHT IS TEN THOUSAND YEARS.</description>

No ripples
24 September 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER,
ON ONE OCCASION, A MONK CALLED ON MA TZU AND ASKED HIM, “WHO IS THE MAN WHO DOES NOT TAKE ALL DHARMAS AS HIS COMPANIONS?”
MA TZU REPLIED, “I WILL TELL YOU THIS AFTER YOU HAVE SWALLOWED ALL THE WATER IN THE WEST RIVER.”
UPON HEARING THIS, THE MONK WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY AWAKENED, AND HE STAYED FOR TWO YEARS AT MA TZU’S MONASTERY.</description>

WE LOSE THE PLACE.’

Love is a breakthrough; a breakthrough from the ego, from all boundaries, from all limitations. Hence love becomes the sky, the inner sky. And the outer sky is nothing compared to the inner; the outer is just a pale reflection of the inner. Once one has looked into the inner then for the first time one feels that even this sky that we have known always is not so unlimited; it has its own limitations.</description>

A MASTER GOT UP TO ADDRESS A GROUP SEEKING ENLIGHTENMENT AND HAD ONLY THIS TO SAY: ‘HA! HA! HA! WHAT’S ALL THIS? GO TO THE BACK OF THE HALL AND HAVE SOME TEA.’ HE THEN GOT DOWN AND DEPARTED.
The only thing that can be said about the ultimate, categorically, is that nothing can be said about it.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
THE STRONGEST EMOTION THAT I HAVE IS HATING DEATH. I WANT TO KILL IT! ONCE AND FOR ALL! THE SECOND THING IS: I FEEL EXTREME PAIN WHEN I REALIZE THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO THANK YOU. IS THERE A CONNECTION?

26 November 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT SAT-CHIT-ANAND HAS TRUTH FIRST, CONSCIOUSNESS SECOND AND BLISS THIRD. IS THERE SOME INEVITABLE SEQUENCE AMONGST THEM?
Amrito, there is no sequence amongst truth, consciousness and bliss. They are not steps of a hierarchy, but they come one after another. Neither of them is higher than the other two, so in the way we understand it, sequence is not there.</description>

Society’s justice is revenge
5 June 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT IS JUSTICE FOR A REBELLIOUS MAN?
Raso, it is one of the most significant questions to be asked – for the simple reason that man has never tried to remove the causes of injustice. On the contrary, in the name of justice, he has been taking revenge on the individuals who were not obedient to the social order, to the establishment, to the vested interests.</description>

19 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
WHEN MAN ATTAINS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND THAT WHICH CHANGES, ABIDING IN PURITY AND STILLNESS, HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE UNITED IN HIM.
THE SOUL OF MAN LOVES PURITY, BUT HIS MIND IS OFTEN REBELLIOUS. THE MIND OF MAN LOVES STILLNESS, BUT HIS DESIRES DRAW HIM INTO ACTIVITY. WHEN A MAN IS CONSTANTLY ABLE TO GOVERN HIS DESIRES, HIS MIND BECOMES SPONTANEOUSLY STILL.</description>

Question 1
QUESTIONER: HOW IS IT THAT KRISHNA IS CALLED A CELIBATE IN SPITE OF HIS BEING A MAN OF JOYOUS DANCE AND SENSUOUS CELEBRATION? WHAT IS THE PLACE AND RELEVANCE OF RAASLEELA – THE DANCE OF CELEBRATION – IN MODERN SOCIETY?
To understand raasleela, the dance of celebration, what is first necessary to know is that the whole of life is a meeting of contradictory forces, and that all its happiness comes from this union of the opposites.</description>

9 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
IN THE STATE OF NIRVICHARA SAMADHI, AN OBJECT IS EXPERIENCED IN ITS FULL PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE IN THIS STATE KNOWLEDGE IS GAINED DIRECT, WITHOUT THE USE OF THE SENSES.
THE PERCEPTION GAINED IN NIRVICHARA SAMADHI TRANSCENDS ALL NORMAL PERCEPTIONS BOTH IN EXTENT AND INTENSITY.
WHEN THIS CONTROLLING OF ALL OTHER CONTROLS IS TRANSCENDED, THE SEEDLESS SAMADHI IS ATTAINED, AND WITH IT, FREEDOM FROM LIFE AND DEATH.</description>

WHAT DO YOU TEACH AND WHAT IS YOUR DOCTRINE ?
I am not teaching a doctrine. Teaching a doctrine is rather meaningless. I am not a philosopher; my mind is antiphilosophical. Philosophy has led nowhere and cannot lead anywhere. The mind that thinks, that questions, cannot know.

[THE FIRST QUESTION IS MISSING]
The truth cannot be known before you actually realize it. And knowing something about truth is quite different from knowing truth. Whatever you know about truth, it is bound to be untrue. It is untrue because in the absence of personal experience it simply cannot be understood. It is untrue, not from the point of view of the speaker, but from that of the listener.</description>

The Sword of Love-and-Death
19 February 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT IS COMING ALONG FAST, AND THE SHADOWS OF LOVE
CLOSE IN THE BODY AND THE MIND.
OPEN THE WINDOW TO THE WEST, AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE AIR INSIDE YOU.
NEAR YOUR BREASTBONE THERE IS AN OPEN FLOWER. DRINK THE HONEY THAT IS ALL AROUND THAT FLOWER. WAVES ARE COMING IN:</description>

The Touch of the Master
4 September 1977 am in Buddha Hall
THERE WAS ONCE A SUFI WHO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS DISCIPLES WOULD, AFTER HIS DEATH, FIND THE RIGHT TEACHER OF THE WAY FOR THEM.
HE THEREFORE, AFTER THE OBLIGATORY BEQUESTS LAID DOWN BY LAW, LEFT HIS DISCIPLES SEVENTEEN CAMELS, WITH THIS ORDER:
‘YOU WILL DIVIDE THE CAMELS AMONG THE THREE OF YOU IN THE FOLLOWING PROPORTIONS: THE OLDEST SHALL HAVE HALF, THE MIDDLE IN AGE ONE-THIRD, AND THE YOUNGEST SHALL HAVE ONE-NINTH.</description>

The unknown life of Jesus
WAS JESUS FULLY ENLIGHTENED?
Yes, he was fully enlightened. But because he lived amidst a people who were absolutely ignorant about enlightenment, he had to speak in a language which may indicate he was not. He had to use such language because, at that particular time and place, there was no other possibility – only this could be understood.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT ARE THE ROOTS AND WHAT ARE THE WINGS OF A MEDITATOR?
Meditation is a way of settling in oneself, at the innermost core of your being. Once you have found the center of your existence, you will have found both the roots and the wings.
The roots are in existence, making you a more integrated human being, an individual.</description>

Prem means love, and shiven means god of goodness, god of virtue. The name will mean, prem, the god of love, the god of goodness. And love really is the god of all good. If you try to be good without being deeply in love, your goodness will harm people.</description>

The first question Question 1
OSHO, IS NO-MIND THE ULTIMATE PRAYER?
Prabuddha,
PRAYER IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE. Prayer is not something that can be thought either. Prayer is a state of silent being, of utter silence. One simply is... then one is in prayer. If you do prayer, you miss the whole point.</description>

9 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY CAN’T I KNOW GOD?
FOR YOU ARE IT! Knowledge is not possible. Knowledge pre-supposes division, split. The knower has to be separate from the known. That’s why God cannot be known. You can be God – you are – but you cannot know Him.</description>

Thou Has Reaped
10 April 1973 pm in Bikaner Palace Hotel
THE SPIRITUAL SEARCH starts as a seeking for eternal bliss, as a seeking for eternal liberation, as a seeking for divine light and divine life. But the center remains with you. In the beginning it is a self-centered search. Whatsoever you are seeking you are seeking for yourself.
This self-centeredness ultimately will prove a barrier, because you cannot be in total ecstasy if you are self-centered.</description>

A meditation for the jet set ‌
You cannot find a better situation in which to meditate than while flying at a high altitude. The higher the altitude, the easier is the meditation. Hence, for centuries, meditators have been moving to the Himalayas to find a high altitude.
When gravitation is less and the earth is very far away, many pulls of the earth are far away.</description>

Abdullah ‌
One Sufi mystic who had remained happy his whole life—no one had ever seen him unhappy—he was always laughing. He was laughter, his whole being was a perfume of celebration. In his old age, when he was dying—he was on his deathbed, and still enjoying death, laughing hilariously—a disciple asked, “You puzzle us. Now you are dying. Why are you laughing?</description>

Abiding joy for no reason at all ‌
For no reason at all you suddenly feel yourself joyous. In ordinary life, if there is some reason, you are joyful. You have met a beautiful woman and you are joyous, or you have got the money that you always wanted and you are joyous, or you have purchased the house with a beautiful garden and you are joyous, but these joys cannot last long.</description>

All paths merge on the mountain‌
Is awareness a higher value than love?
The highest peak is the culmination of all values: truth, love, awareness, authenticity, totality. At the highest peak they are indivisible. They are separate only in the dark valleys of our unconsciousness. They are separate only when they are polluted, mixed with other things. The moment they become pure they become one; the more pure, the closer they come to each other.</description>

Aloneness: your self-nature ‌
Aloneness is a flower, a lotus blooming in your heart. Aloneness is positive, aloneness is health. It is the joy of being yourself. It is the joy of having your own space.
Meditation means: bliss in being alone…. One is really alive when one has become capable of it, when there is no dependence any more on anybody, on any situation, on any condition.</description>

An Energy Phenomenon ‌
Meditation is an energy phenomenon. One very basic thing has to be understood about all types of energies, and this is the basic law to be understood: energy moves in a dual polarity. That is the only way it moves; there is no other way for its movement. It moves in a dual polarity.
For any energy to become dynamic, the anti-pole is needed.</description>

‌
Anything Can Be a Meditation ‌
This is the secret: de-automatize. If we can de-automatize our activities, then the whole life becomes a meditation. Then any small thing, taking a shower, eating your food, talking to your friend, becomes meditation.
Meditation is a quality; it can be brought to anything. It is not a specific act. People think that way, they think meditation is a specific act—when you sit facing to the east, you repeat certain mantras, you burn some incense, you do this and that at a particular time in a particular way with a particular gesture.</description>

‌
Appreciate unawareness ‌
While aware enjoy awareness, and while unaware enjoy unawareness. Nothing is wrong, because unawareness is like a rest. Otherwise awareness would become a tension. If you are awake twenty-four hours, how many days do you think you can be alive? Without food a man can live for three months; without sleep, within three weeks he will go mad, and he will try to commit suicide.</description>

Atisha’s Heart Meditation‌
Atisha said:
Train in joining, sending and taking together. Do this by riding the breath.
Atisha says: start being compassionate. And the method is, when you breathe in—listen carefully, it is one of the greatest methods—when you breathe in, think that you are breathing in all the miseries of all the people in the world. All the darkness, all the negativity, all the hell that exists anywhere, you are breathing it in.</description>

Aum ‌
AUM is one of the basic sounds. A-U-M: these three sounds are combined in it. A-U-M are three basic sounds. All sounds are made of them or derived from them; all sounds are combinations of these three sounds. So these three are basic. They are as basic as the claim of physics that the electron, neutron and proton are basic. This has to be deeply understood.</description>

‌
Be comfortable ‌
A posture should be such that you can forget your body. What is comfort?
When you forget your body, you are comfortable. When you are reminded continuously of the body, you are uncomfortable. So whether you sit in a chair or you sit on the ground, that is not the point. Be comfortable, because if you are not comfortable in the body you cannot long for other blessings which belong to deeper layers: the first layer missed, all other layers closed.</description>

Be patient ‌
Don’t be in a hurry. So often, hurrying causes delay. As you thirst, wait patiently—the deeper the waiting, the sooner it comes.
You have sown the seed, now sit in the shade and watch what happens. The seed will break, it will blossom, but you cannot speed the process. Doesn’t everything need time? Work you must, but leave the results to God.</description>

Be playful ‌
Millions of people miss meditation because meditation has taken on a wrong connotation. It looks very serious, looks gloomy, has something of the church in it; it looks as if it is only for people who are dead, or almost dead—those who are gloomy, serious, have long faces, who have lost festivity, fun, playfulness, celebration….
These are the qualities of meditation: a really meditative person is playful; life is fun for him, life is a leela, a play.</description>

Begin with catharsis ‌
I never tell people to begin with just sitting. Begin from where beginning is easy. Otherwise, you will begin to feel many things unnecessarily—things that are not there.
If you begin with sitting, you will feel much disturbance inside. The more you try to just sit, the more disturbance will be felt. You will become aware only of your insane mind and nothing else.</description>

Meditation techniques are doings, because you are advised to do something
—even to meditate is to do something; even to sit silently is to do something, even to not do anything is a sort of doing. So in a superficial way, all meditation techniques are doings. But in a deeper way they are not, because if you succeed in them, the doing disappears.</description>

Center of the cyclone ‌
When desire grips you, you are disturbed. Of course, that is natural. Desire grips you, then your mind starts wavering and many ripples go on, on the surface. The desire pulls you somewhere into the future; the past pushes you somewhere into the future. You are disturbed: you are not at ease. Desire is, therefore, a ‘dis-ease.’</description>

It moves just as seasons move: summer comes, then rains follow, then comes winter, and it goes on in a circle.

‌Chapter 10 - Enlightenment is not an experience‌ no obstacle to it -- no experience, no object -- it moves back, and the subject itself becomes the object.
That&#39;s what J. Krishnamurti, for his whole life, continued to say: that when the observer becomes the observed, know that you have arrived.
Before that, there are thousands of things in the way. The body gives its own experiences, which have become known as the experiences of the centers of kundalini; seven centers become seven lotus flowers.</description>

Question 1
IS SELF-ACTUALIZATION A BASIC NEED?
There are many questions. The first: IS SELF-ACTUALIZATION A BASIC NEED OF MAN? First, try to understand what is meant by self-actualization. A. H. Maslow has used this term &#34;self-actualization.&#34; Man is born as potentiality. He is not really actual -- just potential. Man is born as a possibility, not as an actuality.</description>

‌“LOVE” IS A VERB‌ {#love-is-a-verb style=”padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;“} Love is existential; fear is only the absence of love. And the problem with any absence is that you cannot do anything directly about it. Fear is like darkness. What can you do about darkness directly? You cannot drop it, you cannot throw it out, you cannot bring it in. There is no way to relate with darkness without bringing light in.</description>

‌Chapter 10: The End Is in the Beginning The first question:
Osho,
How is it that you describe the life that is really ours, and which you have transcended, so correctly and in every detail, while we remain so ignorant of it? Is it not paradoxical?
It looks paradoxical; it is not. But you can understand only when you have transcended. While you are in a certain state of mind you cannot understand that state of mind; you are so involved in it, you are so identified with it.</description>

‌Chapter 12 - Life itself is a miracle‌ It makes one feel afraid, so one never looks into it. Otherwise, even when you are in the crowd, you are alone; even if your name is known to people, does that make any difference?
You are still a stranger. And this can be seen... a husband and wife may have lived thirty years, forty years, fifty years together, but the more they live together, the more they become aware that they are strangers.</description>

Only after you have moved in deep love and the ego has really been dropped—and there is something very valuable which can be gained only if you drop the ego, and that price has to be paid—when you have really loved deeply, then a new kind of integration will arise in you. Love does two things: first it takes the ego away, then it gives you the center.</description>

It can bring you into a deep, peaceful, inner silence either through making your own vocal sounds or by just listening to the music and feeling the sounds within you.
* All chakras lie deep within, rather than on the surface of the body.</description>

IF ENLIGHTENMENT AND SAMADHI MEAN TOTAL CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, ALL-PERVADING CONSCIOUSNESS, THEN IT SEEMS VERY STRANGE TO CALL THIS STATE OF COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS CENTERING, AS THE WORD `CENTERING&#39; IMPLIES ONE-POINTEDNESS. WHY IS COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, OR SAMADHI, CALLED CENTERING?
Centering is the path, not the goal. Centering is the method, not the result. Samadhi is not called centering; centering is the technique to samadhi.</description>

Once the dewdrop has fallen into the ocean, now there is no way even to find it. The question of turning back does not arise.
Enlightenment, hence, is the ultimate truth. What begins as flowering moves on the path of awakening, reaches to self-realization.</description>

‌Chapter 16 - Love is always an emperor‌ It was unfortunate that Mahavira and Gautam Buddha both used the word nonviolence. I can understand their difficulty. Their difficulty was that by &#34;love&#34; people understand biological love; to avoid that misunderstanding they used a negative term: nonviolence. It gives the appearance that violence is the positive thing and nonviolence is the negative thing.
In fact, violence is the negative thing and love is the positive thing, but they were all afraid of using the word love.</description>

MY EYES, I SEE A BIG, BLACK SPOT. INSIDE THIS BLACK SPOT THERE IS A WHITE ONE. THIS WHITE SPOT COMES NEARER AND NEARER, WHIRLING IN A CIRCLE. BUT JUST BEFORE THE BLACK SPOT DISAPPEARS TOTALLY, I OPEN MY

‌Chapter 19 - At the maximum you disappear‌ But it is dangerous. You know perfectly well: in the night when you go to sleep you need a pillow. Have you ever thought why? It is a protection for your brain, because if you lie down without a pillow, the energy flow will be horizontal, like the animals, and in eight hours of sleeping it can destroy your brain system completely.</description>

SUTRAS:
4. SUPPOSE YOU ARE GRADUALLY BEING DEPRIVED OF STRENGTH OR OF KNOWLEDGE. AT THE INSTANT OF DEPRIVATION, TRANSCEND.
5. DEVOTION FREES.
For tantra, man himself is the disease. It is not that your mind is disturbed -- rather, your mind is the disturbance. It is not that you are tense within, but rather, you are the tension.</description>

‌Chapter 2: The Path of Yoga and the Path of Tantra
Many questions are there. The first:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL YOGA AND TANTRA? ARE THEY THE SAME?
Tantra and yoga are basically different. They reach to the same goal; however, their paths are not only different, but contrary also. So this has to be understood very clearly.
The yoga process is also methodology; yoga is also technique.</description>

Osho,
You said last night that total despair, frustration and hopelessness is the beginning ground for Yoga. This gives Yoga a pessimistic look. Is this pessimistic state really necessary to begin the path of Yoga? Can an optimist also begin with the path of Yoga?
It is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, because pessimism and optimism are two aspects of the same coin.</description>

The very idea of helping is not right. The child needs your love, not your help. The child needs nourishment, support, but not your help.</description>

‌Chapter 20 - Your longing is the seed‌ Neither the lover knows himself nor you know yourself. Two unknown beings, two strangers who don&#39;t know anything about themselves are trying to know each other -- it is an exercise in futility. It is bound to be a frustration, a failure. And that&#39;s why all lovers are angry at each other. They think perhaps the other is not allowing an entry into his private world: &#34;</description>

They would never try to find that there was much more hidden in the physical body -- the consciousness, the soul, the god.

7. LOOK UPON A BOWL WITHOUT SEEING THE SIDES OR THE MATERIAL. IN A FEW MOMENTS BECOME AWARE.
8. SEE AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME A BEAUTEOUS PERSON OR AN ORDINARY OBJECT.
Tonight&#39;s techniques are concerned with the practice of looking. Before we enter these techniques, something has to be understood about the eyes, because all these seven techniques depend on that.</description>

‌Chapter 26 - Life&#39;s aim is life itself‌ God. But life is so real that thousands of years of all the religions have not been able even to make a dent in it, although they have all been anti-life. Their God was not the innermost center of life, their God was to be found only in renouncing life. It has been a very great calamity humanity has passed through: the very idea of renouncing life means respecting death.</description>

‌Chapter 26 - Life&#39;s aim is life itself‌ To me, God is not someone who created the world. God is someone that you create when you live totally, intensely -- with all your heart, not holding anything back. When your life becomes simply a moment-to-moment joy, a moment-to- moment dance, when your life is nothing but a festival of lights... every moment is so precious because once it is gone, it is gone forever.</description>

‌Chapter 26 - Life&#39;s aim is life itself‌ What is virtue? Who is going to decide? According to Mohammedanism, animals are created by God for man to eat. There is no question of violence; their very purpose is to be nourishment for humanity -- so says the holy KORAN. Now, no Eastern religion can accept Mohammedanism as a religion. Mohammed married nine wives. He was continuously fighting.</description>

‌Chapter 3 - Seek nothing outside‌ Perhaps Buddha is the only person in the past who has given any credit to creativeness.
Nirmanakaya means the body of creativeness. Nirman means creativeness.

This has to be recognized—unconsciously, you are in the journey: that’s why it feels as if you have to start it.

EVEN REMEMBERING UNION, WITHOUT THE EMBRACE, TRANSFORMATION.
ON JOYOUSLY SEEING A LONG ABSENT FRIEND, PERMEATE THIS JOY. WHEN EATING OR DRINKING, BECOME THE TASTE OF FOOD OR DRINK, AND BE FILLED.</description>

‌Chapter 34: &#34;Cosmic orgasm&#34; through Tantra
BEGIN.…
Before I take your questions some other points have to be clarified, because those points will help you understand more what tantra means. Tantra is not a moral concept. It is neither moral nor immoral. It is amoral. It is a science, and science is neither. Your moralities and concepts concerning moral behavior are irrelevant for tantra.</description>

OH LOTUS-EYED ONE, SWEET OF TOUCH, WHEN SINGING, SEEING, TASTING, BE AWARE YOU ARE AND DISCOVER THE EVER-LIVING. WHEREVER SATISFACTION IS FOUND, IN WHATEVER ACT, ACTUALIZE THIS.
AT THE POINT OF SLEEP, WHEN THE SLEEP HAS NOT YET COME AND THE EXTERNAL WAKEFULNESS VANISHES, AT THIS POINT BEING IS REVEALED. ILLUSIONS DECEIVE, COLORS CIRCUMSCRIBE, EVEN DIVISIBLES ARE INDIVISIBLE.</description>

2 September 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium OUR BELOVED MASTER,
BUKKO SAID:
THE WAY OUT OF LIFE-AND-DEATH IS NOT SOME SPECIAL TECHNIQUE; THE
ESSENTIAL THING IS TO SEE THROUGH TO THE ROOT OF LIFE-AND- DEATH.
THAT ROOT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FELL FROM HEAVEN OR SPRANG UP
FROM EARTH. IT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE FUNCTIONING OF EVERY MAN, LIVING WITH HIS LIFE, DYING WITH HIS DEATH, BECOMING A BUDDHA, MAKING A PATRIARCH.</description>

Ordinarily you are just an empty bottle; inside there is nothing. You have to earn, you have to be worthy, you have to gather your consciousness in such a crystallized way that it can pass through death without dying.</description>

‌Chapter 4 - This harvest moon‌ And I absolutely support Ryota. There have been many buddhas in many different places, of different races, from different countries. They may not have been called buddhas, they may have spoken different languages, they may not have spoken at all; their existence may not have been recorded. But it is impossible to believe that in four million years there has been only one man who attained to the highest peak of consciousness.</description>

WHY DO INDIANS THINK OF SEX IN TERMS OF NEED INSTEAD OF FUN? THEY
ALSO THINK AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY HAVE TRANSCENDED SEX, BUT IN
REALITY IT HAS ONLY BEEN SUPPRESSED. OSHO, IS THERE ANY SIMILARITY
BETWEEN SUPPRESSION AND TRANSCENDENCE WHICH CAN MISLEAD PEOPLE, AS YOU SOMETIMES SAY THAT THERE IS SOME SIMILARITY BETWEEN A BUDDHA AND A MADMAN?</description>

They don&#39;t know anything about fun, about playfulness. They are serious people

You cannot live with saints for long. Even to be with a saint for twenty-four hours is a punishment; it is not a reward because within twenty-four hours he will make you so bitter towards life, he will make you so sad, he will make you so sour, he will make you feel so guilty, condemned.</description>

‌Chapter 47: Tantric meditation with light techniques
CONSIDER YOUR ESSENCE AS LIGHT RAYS FROM CENTER TO CENTER UP THE VERTEBRAE, AND SO RISES &#34;LIVINGNESS&#34; IN YOU.
OR IN THE SPACES BETWEEN, FEEL THIS AS LIGHTNING.
FEEL THE COSMOS AS A TRANSLUCENT EVER-LIVING PRESENCE.
Man can be considered in three ways: in terms of the normal, the abnormal and the supernormal. Western psychology is basically concerned with the abnormal, the pathological, with the man who has fallen down from the normal, who has fallen down from the norm.</description>

‌Chapter 49: Conscious doing
IN SUMMER WHEN YOU SEE THE ENTIRE SKY ENDLESSLY CLEAR ENTER SUCH CLARITY. SHAKTI,
SEE ALL SPACE AS IF ALREADY ABSORBED IN YOUR OWN HEAD IN THE BRILLIANCE.
WAKING, SLEEPING, DREAMING, KNOW YOU AS LIGHT.
AS I LOOK IN YOUR EYES I never see you there -- as if you are absent. You exist absently, and this is the core of all suffering.</description>

And if you feel you have been hurt by love, it is something else in you, not your loving quality, that feels hurt. Unless you see this you will go on moving in the same circles again and again. What you call love can hide many unloving things in you; the human mind has been very clever, cunning, in deceiving others and in deceiving itself, too.</description>

‌Chapter 58: In your hands
Question 1
TECHNIQUES ARE SHORTCUTS, REVOLUTIONS, BUT ARE NOT THESE AGAINST TAO, SWABHAV, THE NATURE?
They are. They are against tao, they are against swabhav. Any effort is against shabhav, tao; effort as such is against tao. If you can leave everything to swabhav, tao, nature, then no technique is needed, because that is the ultimate technique. If you can leave everything to tao, that is the deepest surrender possible.</description>

SUPPOSE YOU CONTEMPLATE SOMETHING BEYOND PERCEPTION,
BEYOND GRASPING, BEYOND NOT BEING.
-- YOU.
I AM EXISTING.
THIS IS MINE.
THIS IS THIS.
OH BELOVED,
EVEN IN SUCH KNOW ILLIMITABLY.
Man is Janus-Faced -- animal and divine both. Animal belongs to his past, divine belongs to his future, and this creates the difficulty. The past has passed, it is no more; just a shadow of it lingers on.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6 - Awakening‌ 26 February 1975 a.m. in Buddha Hall
DURING THREE YEARS OF SEVERE TRAINING UNDER THE GREAT MASTER
GIZAN, KOSHU WAS UNABLE TO GAIN SATORI.
AT THE BEGINNING OF A SPECIAL SEVEN-DAY SESSION OF DISCIPLINE, HE
THOUGHT HIS CHANCE HAD FINALLY COME. HE CLIMBED THE TOWER OF THE
TEMPLE GATE, AND GOING UP TO THE ARHAT IMAGES HE MADE THIS VOW:

7 August 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium OUR BELOVED MASTER,
SEIGEN SAID:
IF NOW YOU COMPREHEND IT, WHERE IS THAT WHICH YOU DID NOT

‌Chapter 6 - Cages of gold‌ Seigen is saying that you have to be free from ignorance and you have to be free from enlightenment. This is called the lion&#39;s roar. Even enlightenment is not going to be his imprisonment. He wants the whole universe without any limits.
An enlightened person has a tiny flame. But if that tiny flame makes him feel special, greater and better than others, it has already become a fetter.</description>

‌Chapter 6 - Cages of gold‌ I said to these people, &#34;Don&#39;t make distinctions.&#34; Let me remain simply a nobody, with no power, with no domination. Because every subtle desire to be special is a desire for power.
You gather money to be powerful, you go into politics to be powerful, you search for enlightenment again for power. Enlightened you will be worshipped. Perhaps enlightenment is the most dangerous disease of all, because who wants to be unenlightened once he has become enlightened?</description>

‌ATTRACTION AND OPPOSITION‌
There are a few very fundamental things to be understood. First, a man and a woman are on the one hand halves of the other, and on the other hand, opposite polarities. Their being opposites attracts them to each other. The farther away they are, the deeper will be the attraction; the more different from each other they are, the more will be the charm and beauty and attraction.</description>

‌Chapter 6: The Experience of Death and Life in the Subtle Bodies The soul resides within two bodies – the subtle body and the gross body. At the time of death, the gross body dies. The body which is made of earth and water, the body which consists of flesh, bones and marrow, drops, dies. Subsequently, the body comprised of subtle thoughts, subtle feelings, subtle vibrations, subtle filaments, remains.</description>

‌Chapter 6: The Purity of Yoga The first question:
Osho,
You said that Patanjali’s Yoga is an exact science, absolutely logical, in which the result is as certain as two plus two make four. If the attainment of the unknown and infinite can be reduced to mere logic, is it not true and at the same time absurd that the infinite phenomenon is within the orbit of the finite mind?</description>

Question 1
YOU SAY THAT RELIGION IS TOTAL FREEDOM OR MOKSHA, AND YOU ALSO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SURRENDER IN RELIGION. BUT ARE NOT FREEDOM AND SURRENDER CONTRADICTORY IN TERMS?
They appear contradictory but they are not. And they appear so because of the language; existentially they are not. Try to understand two things. First: you cannot be free remaining as you are, because as you are is your bondage.</description>

YOU SAID THAT LOVE IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH DEATH. THEN WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN BUDDHA&#39;S LOVE.
For an ignorant person love is always part of hate, it always goes with hate. For the ignorant mind hate and love are just two aspects of the same coin. For the ignorant mind love is never pure.</description>

‌Chapter 73: Fear of transformation
THE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME FOR AN ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.
BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.
Many people seem to be interested in meditation, but that interest cannot be very deep because so very few are transformed through it.</description>

‌Chapter 9 - Lovers of tao‌ In English restaurants, the fly is carefully removed between finger and thumb, placed on the table, and then politely ignored for the rest of the meal.
In France, the fly-finder consumes the soup, but pushes the fly to the side of the plate.
In Scotland, the fly is lifted forcibly out of the soup and squeezed over the plate, then dropped to the ground and trodden into the carpet.</description>

‌Chapter 9 - Lovers of tao‌ (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)
Be silent. Close your eyes.
Feel your body to be completely frozen. Gather all your energy inwards.
Look, almost like an arrow,
searching deep for your center of being, because your center of being is also
the center of the universe.
One who knows it becomes a buddha. Deeper and deeper ...
This moment is precious.</description>

‌Chapter 9 - Lovers of tao‌ You have all disappeared into an oceanic love, into an oceanic consciousness,
dissolving your thin boundaries.
Remember this universal experience twenty-four hours, just like an undercurrent. Remain a buddha -- walking or sitting, sleeping or waking.
Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)
Now you can come back, but come back not the same as you had gone in. Come back much more solid,</description>

13. OR, IMAGINE THE FIVE-COLORED CIRCLES OF THE PEACOCK TAIL TO BE YOUR FIVE SENSES IN ILLIMITABLE SPACE. NOW LET THEIR BEAUTY MELT WITHIN. SIMILARLY, AT ANY POINT IN SPACE OR ON A WALL -- UNTIL THE POINT DISSOLVES. THEN YOUR WISH FOR ANOTHER COMES TRUE.

‌LOVE AND THE ART OF NON-DOING‌
There are things which only happen, which cannot be done. Doing is the way of very ordinary things, mundane things. You can do something to earn money, you can do something to be powerful, you can do something to have prestige; but you cannot do anything as far as love is concerned, gratitude is concerned, silence is concerned.</description>

‌Chapter 9: The Subtle Bodies According to Patanjali The yoga system of Patanjali is not a philosophical system. It is empirical; it is a tool to work with – but still it has a philosophy. That too, is just to give an intellectual understanding of where you are moving, what you are seeking. But philosophy is arbitrary, utilitarian, just to give a comprehensive picture of the territory you are going to discover; but the philosophy has to be understood.</description>

‌Chapter 9: This Very Life, the Ultimate Joy The first state of vairagya, desirelessness: cessation from self-indulgence in the thirst for sensuous pleasures, with conscious effort.
The last state of vairagya, desirelessness: cessation of all desiring by knowing the innermost nature of purush, the supreme self.
Abhyasa andvairagya – constant inner practice and desirelessness: these are the two foundation stones of Patanjali’s Yoga. Constant inner effort is needed not because something has to be achieved but because of wrong habits.</description>

‌Chapter title: God: The ultimate synthesis‌ 28 October 1975 am in Buddha Hall Question 1
HOW IS ONE WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED ALL HIS LIFE TO ANALYZE AND
QUESTION AND DOUBT TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN DOUBT AND TRUST?
DOUBT IS BEAUTIFUL in itself. The problem arises when you are stuck in it.
Then doubt becomes death. Analysis is perfect if you remain seperate and aloof from it.</description>

WHO PREPARED THE WAY FOR YOU?
NOBODY HAS PREPARED THE WAY FOR ME, and neither am I preparing the way for anybody. This has to be understood.
There are four possibilities. One, the oldest and the most used, is what happened in Jesus&#39; case. John the Baptist prepared the way; the disciple preceded the Master.</description>

Prem Sushila. It means love virtue... and love is the only virtue. Other virtues are needed only when love is missing. They are substitutes and very poor substitutes at that. Love is the only commandment. If love is missing then the ten commandments are needed, and even those ten cannot fulfill the need because all will be formal, imposed.</description>

that he is divided into many fragments and all those fragments are fighting to dominate man has not got one self, he has got many selves the idea of one mind is very false man is poly-psychic: he is many minds he is a crowd and of course the crowd cannot be peaceful there is continuous competition each fragment trying to come up on the top there is great politics in everybody&#39;s inner world unless this whole politics ceases there is no possibility of peace at the most people can manage just a facade of peace, just on the surface but deep down they are boiling deep down there is always war sometimes hot, sometimes cold, but no peace in fact the only way to be peaceful is to help all these fragments melt into oneness unless that integration happens one can befool others that one is living in peace 1/08/07</description>

Osho&#39;s books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the ego
and man is very afraid of dropping the ego it seems almost like committing suicide it only seems so because we don&#39;t know anything other than the ego ego has become our only identity and to drop it certainly means you are dropping your individuality it is not true</description>

the phenomenon of awareness is paradoxical half of it, the first half, is human effort the other half, the second half, is a divine gift one has to do the utmost one can do to attain it but it is not attained only by that it is not attained without it either the human effort prepares you to receive the gift if you are unprepared and the gift comes you will not even be able to recognise it there is no question of receiving it, welcoming it so the first part is absolutely necessary but one should not get the idea that one attains it through effort the effort only removes the barriers it is negative</description>

awareness is the seed and blissfulness is the flower and the whole pilgrimage
is between these two points awareness and blissfulness we are living in unawareness hence bliss cannot blossom in awareness bliss, in unawareness misery there are the natural by-products everybody wants to be blissful but just by wanting it you cannot attain it you will have to follow the right procedure you will have to follow the law of nature one has to begin with awareness and then bliss comes of its own accord you need not worry about it you need not even desire it, it comes inevitably but the whole work consists of becoming more aware</description>

Compassion ‌
Buddha has defined compassion as ‘love plus meditation.’ When your love is not just a desire for the other, when your love is not only a need, when your love is a sharing, when your love is not that of a beggar but that of an emperor, when your love is not asking for something in return but is ready only to give—to give for the sheer joy of giving—then add meditation to it and the pure fragrance is released, the imprisoned splendor is released.</description>

Count the moments of awareness‌
You tell us to be aware of everything—which means to be a witness to everything, every act. When I decide to be aware in work, I forget about awareness, and when I become aware that I was not aware, I feel guilty; I feel that I have made a mistake. Could you please explain?
It is one of the basic problems for anybody who is trying to be aware while at work—because work demands that you should forget yourself completely.</description>

Devavani ‌
Every night before you go to sleep, you can do a small technique that will help tremendously. Put the lights out, sit in your bed ready to sleep, but sit for fifteen minutes. Close your eyes and then start any monotonous nonsense sound, for example: la, la, la—and wait for the mind to supply new sounds. The only thing to be remembered is that those sounds or words should not be of any language that you know.</description>

Don’t be fooled by experiences‌
All experiences are just tricks of the mind, all experiences are just escapes.
Meditation is not an experience, it is a realization. Meditation is not an experience; rather, it is a stopping of all experience. §
Experience is something outside you. The experiencer is your being. And this is the distinction between true spirituality and false: if you are after experiences, the spirituality is false; if you are after the experiencer, then it is true.</description>

‌
Don’t look for results ‌
The ego is result-oriented, the mind always hankers for results. The mind is never interested in the act itself, its interest is in the result. “What am I going to gain out of it?” If the mind can manage to gain without going through any action, then it will choose the short-cut.
That’s why educated people become very cunning, because they are able to find short-cuts.</description>

‌
Enough space ‌
When you are trying to meditate, put the phone off the hook, disengage yourself. Put a notice on the door that for one hour nobody should knock, that you are meditating. And when you move into the meditation room take your shoes off, because you are walking on sacred ground. Not only take your shoes off, but everything that you are preoccupied with.</description>

Enter the clear sky ‌
Meditate on the sky: a summer sky with no clouds, endlessly empty and clear, nothing moving in it, in its total virginity. Contemplate on it, meditate on it, and enter this clarity. Become this clarity, this space-like clarity.
To meditate on the sky is beautiful. Just lie down so you forget the earth; just lie down on your back on any lonely beach, on any ground, and just look at the sky.</description>

Finding the real source ‌
When you see a friend and suddenly feel a joy rising in your heart,
concentrate on this joy. Feel it and become it, and meet the friend while being aware and filled with your joy. Let the friend be just on the periphery, and you remain centered in your feeling of happiness.
This can be done in many other situations.</description>

This was the technique given to Pythagoras. Pythagoras went with this technique to Greece. And, really, he became the fountainhead, the source, of all mysticism in the West. He is the father of all mysticism in the West.
This technique is one of the very deep methods. Try to understand it.
Modern physiology, scientific research, says that between the two eyebrows is the gland which is the most mysterious part in the body.</description>

Foreword ‌
Meditation is a science, not a superstition. Meditation says that if you experiment with your mind—it is too full of thoughts—thoughts can be dispersed. The clouds can be dispersed and you can attain to an empty sky of your inner being. And it needs just a little courage, a little effort, a little daring, a little persistence and perseverance. A little patience, yes, but no trust—you don’t believe in God?</description>

‌
From head to heart ‌
The first point: try to be headless. Visualize yourself as headless; move headlessly. It sounds absurd, but it is one of the most important exercises. Try it, and then you will know. Walk, and feel as if you have no head. In the beginning it will be only ’as if.’It will be very weird. When the feeling comes to you that you have no head, it will be very weird and strange.</description>

‌
Gibberish Meditation ‌
This is a cathartic technique, which encourages expressive body movements.
It should be distinguished from the gentle Devavani Meditation.
Instructions
First stage: 15 minutes
Either alone or in a group, close your eyes and begin to say nonsense sounds
—gibberish. Allow yourself to express whatever needs to be expressed within you.
Throw everything out. The mind always thinks in terms of words.</description>

‌
Golden Light meditation ‌
Do this at least twice a day—the best time is early in the morning, just before you get out of bed. The moment you feel you are alert, awake, do it for twenty minutes. Do it first thing in the morning!—don’t get out of bed. Do it there, then and there, immediately!—because when you are coming out of sleep you are very, very delicate, receptive.</description>

Growing in sensitivity ‌
Meditation will bring you sensitivity, a great sense of belonging to the world.
It is our world—the stars are ours, and we are not foreigners here. We belong intrinsically to existence. We are part of it, we are the heart of it.
You become so sensitive that even the smallest blade of grass takes on an immense importance for you.</description>

This technique is a little difficult, but if you can do it, then it is very wonderful, beautiful. Sitting, don’t divide. Sitting in meditation, be inclusive of all—your body, your mind, your breath, your thinking, your knowing, everything. Be inclusive of all. Don’t divide, don’t create any fragmentation.
Ordinarily we are fragmenting; we go on fragmenting. We say, “The body is not me.</description>

Nobody can exist without a center…. It has not to be created but only rediscovered. Essence is the center, that which is your nature, that which is God-given. Personality is the circumference, that which is cultivated by society; it is not God-given. It is by nurture, not by nature.

Inner darkness‌
How can you enter blackness? Three things.
Step 1:
Stare into blackness. Difficult. It is easy to stare at a flame, at any source of light, because it is there as an object, pointed; you can direct your attention to it. Darkness is not an object; it is everywhere, it is all around. You cannot see it as an object. Stare into the vacuum.</description>

Intelligence simply means ability to respond, because life is a flux. You have to be aware and to see what is demanded of you, what is the challenge of the situation. The intelligent person behaves according to the situation and the stupid behaves according to the ready-made answers. Whether they come from Buddha, Christ or Krishna, it does not matter.</description>

Introduction ‌
Just as the science and technology that has transformed our outer lives has been largely a Western phenomenon, so the East has provided the main source of the science that can transform our inner lives. Today, just like the light bulb, meditation is a universal phenomenon—one helps illuminate our outer world, the other our inner world.
But in the process of becoming universal, many misconceptions about meditation have arisen: that it is “religious,” that it is about sitting in difficult postures, perhaps with your ankle round your neck and a holy look on your face to hide the discomfort; maybe even humming, or chanting some esoteric- sounding mantra.</description>

‌Introduction Osho,
Is knowledge about esoteric subjects such as chakras, collective unconsciousness, energy fields, really helpful along the way, or not? Or will whatever is needed come to me through experience, in its own time?
Anything that is needed will come of its own accord, in its own time. All this so-called esoteric knowledge about chakras, energy fields, kundalini, astral bodies, is dangerous as knowledge.</description>

‌INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS LOVE?‌ It is unfortunate that we have to ask this question. In the natural course of things everybody would know what love is. But in fact nobody knows, or only very rarely does somebody know, what love is. Love has become one of the rarest experiences. Yes, it is talked about. Films and stories are written about it, songs are composed about it, on the television shows you will see it, on the radio, in magazines—a great industry exists to supply you with ideas of what love is.</description>

Just a 180° turn‌
Two Polacks were driving along in the front seat of their car. As they approached a corner, the one who was driving said to his friend, “Will you look out of the window and see if the indicator, the turn signal, is working?”
He promptly leaned out of the window and looked at the indicator light and shouted back at his friend, “Yes it is—no it’s not, yes it is—no it’s not, yes it is— no it’s not.</description>

Laughing Meditation ‌
Laughter brings some energy from your inner source to your surface. Energy starts flowing, follows laughter like a shadow. Have you watched it? When you really laugh, for those few moments you are in a deep meditative state. Thinking stops. It is impossible to laugh and think together. They are diametrically opposite: either you can laugh or you can think.</description>

Love, the fragrance of meditation ‌
If you meditate, sooner or later you will come upon love. If you meditate deeply, sooner or later you will start feeling a tremendous love arising in you that you have never known before—a new quality to your being, a new door opening. You have become a new flame and now you want to share.
If you love deeply, by and by you will become aware that your love is becoming more and more meditative.</description>

So many machines are being developed around the world, pretending that they can give you meditation; you just have to put on earphones and relax, and within ten minutes you will reach the state of meditation.
This is utter stupidity, but there is a reason why such an idea has come to the minds of technical people.</description>

How can I tell the difference between one part of the mind watching another part of the mind, and the watcher. Can the watcher watch itself? One time, I thought I had got it, and then that same day I heard you, “If you think you’ve got the watcher, you’ve missed.” Since then, I’ve tried watching feelings in the body, thoughts and emotions.</description>

Meditation is a knack ‌
Meditation is such a mystery that it can be called a science, an art, a knack, without any contradiction.
From one point of view it is a science because there is a clear-cut technique that has to be done. There are no exceptions to it, it is almost like a scientific law.
But from a different point of view it can also be said to be an art.</description>

Meditation is not concentration‌
Meditations can be wrong. For example, any meditation that leads you deep into concentration is wrong. You will become more and more closed rather than becoming open. If you narrow down your consciousness, concentrate on something, and you exclude the whole of existence and become one-pointed, it will create more and more tension in you. Hence the word ‘attention.’ It means ‘at-tension.</description>

Meditation is not introspection‌
Introspection is thinking about yourself. Self-remembering is not thinking at all: it is becoming aware of yourself. The difference is subtle, but very great.
Western psychology insists on introspection, and Eastern psychology insists on self-remembering. When you introspect, what do you do? For example, you are angry: you start thinking about anger, how it is caused. You start analyzing why it is caused.</description>

Meditations in Sound ‌
The meditations concerned with ear energy are feminine meditations, passive—you have just to listen, not to do anything. Listening to the birds, the wind passing through the pine trees, or to some music, or to the noise of the traffic—just listening, doing nothing—great silence comes in, and great peace starts falling and showering on you. It is easier through the ear than through the eye.</description>

The beginning is mysterious, hence darkness is needed. And the beginning is so delicate, that’s also why darkness is needed.</description>

In meditation sometimes you feel a sort of emptiness that is not really emptiness. I call it just “a sort of emptiness.” When you are meditating, for certain moments, for a few seconds, you will feel as if the thought process has stopped. In the beginning these gaps will come. But because you are feeling as if the thought process has stopped, this is again a thought process, a very subtle thought process.</description>

Mind is bound to raise this question sooner or later, because mind is very much afraid of you becoming a witness. Why is the mind so much afraid of you becoming a witness?</description>

OSHO MEDITATIVE THERAPIES ‌
The ancient methods of meditation were all developed in the East. They never considered the Western man…. I am creating techniques which are not only for the Eastern man, but which are simply for every man— Eastern or Western.
—Osho
Osho has created a series of “meditative therapies”—The Mystic Rose, No- Mind, and Born Again. Uniquely simple and effective, they involve a minimum of interaction among the participants, but the energy of the group helps each individual go more deeply into his or her own process.</description>

OSHO NADABRAHMA MEDITATION‌
Nadabrahma is based on Tibetan techniques done in the early hours of the morning. It can be done at any time of the day, alone or with others, but have an empty stomach and remain inactive for at least 15 minutes afterwards. The meditation lasts an hour, and there are three stages.
First stage: 30 minutes
Sit in a relaxed position with eyes closed and lips together.</description>

OSHO NATARAJ MEDITATION‌
Disappear in the dance
Forget the dancer, the center of the ego; become the dance. That is the meditation. Dance so deeply that you forget completely that ‘you’ are dancing and begin to feel that you are the dance. The division must disappear; then it becomes a meditation. If the division is there, then it is an exercise: good, healthy, but it cannot be said to be spiritual.</description>

OSHO REMINDING YOURSELF OF THE FORGOTTEN LANGUAGE OF TALKING TO YOUR BODYMIND‌
Once you start communicating with your body, things become very easy. The body need not be forced, it can be persuaded. One need not fight with the body—that’s ugly, violent, aggressive, and any sort of conflict is going to create more and more tension. So you need not be in any conflict—let comfort be the rule.</description>

OSHO WHIRLING MEDITATION‌
Sufi Whirling is one of the most ancient techniques, one of the most forceful. It is so deep that even a single experience can make you totally different. Whirl with open eyes, just like small children go on twirling, as if your inner being has become a center and your whole body has become a wheel, moving, a potter’s wheel, moving.</description>

The Journey from “Me” to “We” ‌Understanding the Nature and Nurture of Love Love cannot be learned, it cannot be cultivated. The cultivated love will not be love at all. It will not be a real rose, it will be a plastic flower. When you learn something, it means something comes from the outside; it is not an inner growth. And love has to be your inner growth if it is to be authentic and real.</description>

Love Is a Breeze ‌Making the Most of Romance Don’t think that love has to be permanent, and it will make your love life more beautiful because you will know that today you are together, and tomorrow perhaps you will have to part.
Love comes like a fresh, fragrant breeze into your home, fills it with freshness and fragrance, remains as long as existence allows it, and then moves out.</description>

From Relationship to Relating—Love as a State of Being The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person—without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.</description>

Powerful Methods for Awakening ‌
These are not really meditations. You are just getting in tune. If you have seen Indian classical musicians playing you will notice that for half an hour, or sometimes even more, they simply go on adjusting their instruments. They will move the knobs, they will make the strings tight or loose, and the drum player will go on checking his drum, whether it is perfect or not.</description>

‌Preface Mind is not a thing, but an event. A thing has substance in it; an event is just a process. A thing is like a rock; an event is like a wave: it exists, but is not substantial. It is just the event between the wind and the ocean – a process, a phenomenon.
This is the first thing to be understood: that mind is a process, like a wave or like a river, but it has no substance in it.</description>

Remember, remain a witness‌
This is a meditation in which you have to be continuously alert, conscious, aware, whatsoever you do. The first step, breathing; the second step, catharsis; the third step, the mantra, the mahamantra ‘hoo’. Remain a witness. Don’t get lost.
It is easy to get lost. While you are breathing you can forget. You can become one with the breathing so much that you can forget the witness.</description>

Running, Jogging and Swimming ‌
It is natural and easy to keep alert while you are in movement. When you are just sitting silently, the natural thing is to just fall asleep. When you are lying on your bed it is very difficult to keep alert because the whole situation helps you to fall asleep. But in movement naturally you cannot fall asleep, you function in a more alert way.</description>

A man came to me. He had been suffering from chain-smoking for thirty years; he was ill and the doctors said, “You will never be healthy if you don’t stop smoking.” But he was a chronic smoker; he could not help it. He had tried
—not that he had not tried—he had tried hard, and he had suffered much in trying, but only for one day or two days, and then again the urge would come so tremendously, it would simply take him away.</description>

‌SEX HAS FOUR STAGES;
Those stages have to be understood. Only at the fourth stage does sex become the Golden Flower. Not to understand those four stages is dangerous, and the whole tradition has been keeping you unaware of those four stages.
The first stage is autosexual.
When the child is born he is a narcissist. He loves his body tremendously, and it is beautiful; he knows only HIS body.</description>

Techniques are helpful ‌
With a master, with scientific techniques, you can save much time, opportunity and energy. And sometimes within seconds you can grow so much that even within lives you would not have been able to grow that much. If a right technique is used, growth explodes. And these techniques have been used in thousands of years of experiments. They were not devised by one man; they were devised by many, many seekers, and only the essence is given here.</description>

Sit silently, and with sound there is something very special. Whenever there are sounds, you are the center. All the</description>

The chattering mind‌
You cannot sit even for a single minute, the mind goes on chattering: relevant, irrelevant, meaningful, meaningless thoughts go on. It is a constant traffic and it is always rush hour. You see a flower and you verbalize it; you see a man crossing the street and you verbalize it. The mind can translate every existential thing into a word, everything is being transformed.</description>

The ego‌
The whole idea of modern psychology, modern education, is that unless a person has a very strong ego he will not be able to struggle in life where there is so much competition that, if you are a humble man, anybody will push you aside; you will always remain backward. You need a very steely, strong ego to fight in this competitive world; then only can you become a success.</description>

‌
The flowering of meditation ‌
Meditation is not an Indian method; it is not simply a technique. You cannot learn it. It is a growth: a growth of your total living, out of your total living. Meditation is not something that can be added to you as you are. It cannot be added to you; it can only come to you through a basic transformation, a mutation.</description>

The goose has never been in‌
Sometimes, when dark sides of my mind come up, it really scares me. It is very difficult for me to accept that it is just the polar opposite of the bright ones, I feel dirty and guilty and unworthy. I want to face all facets of my mind and accept them because I hear you often say that acceptance is the condition to transcend the mind.</description>

‌
The great silence ‌
Silence usually is understood to be something negative, something empty, an absence of sound, of noises. This misunderstanding is prevalent because very few people have ever experienced silence.
All that they have experienced in the name of silence is noiselessness. But silence is a totally different phenomenon. It is utterly positive. It is existential, it is not empty. It is overflowing with a music that you have never heard before, with a fragrance that is unfamiliar to you, with a light that can only be seen by the inner eyes.</description>

‌
The heart of peacefulness ‌
A very simple method but it works miraculously—try it. And anyone can try it, there is no danger. In an easy position: the first thing is to be in a relaxed position—easy, whatsoever is easy for you. So don’t try some particular position or asana. Buddha sits in a particular posture. It is easy for him. It can also become easy for you if you practice it for a time, but in the very beginning it will not be easy for you.</description>

The OSHO MYSTIC ROSE MEDITATION‌
The symbol of the mystic rose is that if a man takes care of the seed he is born with, gives it the right soil, gives it the right atmosphere and the right vibrations, moves on a right path where the seed can start growing, then the ultimate growth is symbolized as the mystic rose—when your being blossoms and opens all its petals and releases its beautiful fragrance.</description>

The OSHO NO-MIND MEDITATION‌
No-mind means intelligence. And when I am asking you to do gibberish, I am simply asking you to throw out the mind and all its activity so you remain behind—pure, clean, transparent, perceptive.
—Osho
I am introducing you to a new meditation. It is divided in three parts.
The first part is gibberish. The word ‘gibberish’ comes from a Sufi mystic, Jabbar.</description>

‌
The right place ‌
You should find a place which enhances meditation. For example, sitting under a tree will help. Rather than going and sitting in front of a movie house or going to the railway station and sitting on the platform, go to nature, to the mountains, to the trees, to the rivers where tao is still flowing, vibrating, pulsating, streaming all around.</description>

‌
The three essentials ‌
Meditation has a few essential things in it, whatever the method, but those few essentials are necessary in every method. The first is a relaxed state: no fight with the mind, no control of the mind, no concentration. Second, just watch with a relaxed awareness whatever is going on, without any interference—just watching the mind, silently, without any judgment, evaluation.</description>

The two difficulties ‌
There are only two difficulties on the path of meditation: one is the ego. You are continuously prepared by the society, by the family, by the school, by the church, by everybody around you, to be egoistic. Even modern psychology is based on strengthening the ego.

The watcher on the hill‌
I seem to be neither totally “in the world,” nor the “watcher on the hill.” How to be someplace? I feel like I am in between everything I do.
Then that is exactly the place you should be.
You go on creating problems. Wherever you are, be there. There is no need to be a watcher on the hills.</description>

These methods are simple ‌
Each of these methods which we will be discussing has been told by someone who has achieved. Remember this. They will look too simple, and they
are. To our minds, things which are so simple cannot be appealing. Because if techniques are so simple and the abode is so near, if you are already in it, and the home is so near, you will look ridiculous to yourself—then why are you missing it?</description>

‌
Throwing things out ‌
Whenever you feel that the mind is not tranquil—tense, worried, chattering, anxious, constantly dreaming—do one thing: first exhale deeply. Always start by exhaling. Exhale deeply; as much as you can, throw the air out. Throwing out the air, the mood will be thrown out too, because breathing is everything. And then expel the breath as far as possible. Pull the belly in and retain for a few seconds; don’t inhale.</description>

Touching as a Feather ‌
Use both your palms, put them on your closed eyes, and allow the palms to touch the eyeballs—but just like a feather, with no pressure. If you press you miss the point, you miss the whole technique. Don’t press; just touch like a feather. You will have to adjust, because in the beginning you will be pressing. Put less and less pressure until you are just touching with no pressure at all—just your palms touch the eyeballs.</description>

Vipassana ‌
Vipassana is the meditation that has made more people in the world enlightened than any other, because it is the very essence. All other meditations have the same essence, but in different forms; something non-essential is also joined with them. But vipassana is pure essence. You cannot drop anything out of it and you cannot add anything to improve it.</description>

Watching with the Third Eye ‌
It is one of the contributions of the East to the world: the understanding that between these two eyes, there is a third eye inside which normally remains dormant.
One has to work hard, bring his whole sexual energy upward, against gravitation, and when the energy reaches the third eye, it opens. Many methods have been tried to do that, because when it opens there is suddenly a flash of light, and things which have never been clear to you suddenly become clear.</description>

What is meditation? ‌
Meditation is an adventure, adventure into the unknown, the greatest adventure the human mind can take.
Meditation is just to be, not doing anything—no action, no thought, no emotion. You just are and it is a sheer delight. From where does this delight come when you are not doing anything? It comes from nowhere, or it comes from everywhere.</description>

Gurdjieff tried from one angle. He said, just try to remember you are.
Ramana Maharshi tried from another angle. He made it a meditation to ask, to inquire, “Who am I?” And don’t believe in any answers that the mind can supply. The mind will say, “What nonsense are you asking? You are this, you are that, you are a man, you are a woman, you are educated or uneducated, rich or poor.</description>

Why active meditation? ‌
If you can sit, there is no need for meditations. In Japan, for meditation they have the word “Zazen”. It means just sitting, doing nothing. If you can sit, not doing anything, this is the ultimate in meditations. There is no need for any other thing.
But can you sit? There is the crux of the whole problem. Can you sit?</description>

There is nothing else to do with this unruly servant, but just to watch.</description>

Witnessing, the spirit of meditation‌
When you are not doing anything at all—bodily, mentally, on no level— when all activity has ceased and you simply are, just being, that’s what meditation is. You cannot do it, you cannot practice it: you have only to understand it.
Whenever you can find time for just being, drop all doing. Thinking is also doing, concentration is also doing, contemplation is also doing.</description>

Your real self ‌
Meditation is nothing but a device to make you aware of your real self— which is not created by you, which need not be created by you, which you
already are. You are born with it. You are it! It needs to be discovered. If this is not possible, or if the society does not allow it to happen…and no society allows it to happen, because the real self is dangerous: dangerous for the established church, dangerous for the state, dangerous for the crowd, dangerous for the tradition, because once a man knows his real self, he becomes an individual.</description>

Zazen ‌
The Zen people say just sit, don’t do anything. The most difficult thing in the world is just to sit doing nothing. But once you have got the knack of it, if you go on sitting for a few months doing nothing for a few hours every day, slowly, slowly many things will happen. You will feel sleepy, you will dream.</description>

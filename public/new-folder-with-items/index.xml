      <description>Astrology: The Science of Cosmic Oneness
Osho: Hidden Mysteries, Chapter 5
Astrology is perhaps the most ancient subject and also in a way the most ignored. It is the most ancient because astrology has been in existence as far back as we have been able to investigate the history of mankind. Astrological inscriptions have been found on bone remnants from the Sumerian civilization which existed twenty-five thousand years before Jesus. Bone remnants have been discovered with astrological inscriptions and with an outline of the moon&#39;s orbit in the sky.</description>

Bodhidharma: The Greatest Zen Master Chapter #1 Chapter title: To seek nothing is bliss 5 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium BELOVED OSHO,
BODHIDHARMA&#39;S OUTLINE OF PRACTICE
MANY ROADS LEAD TO THE PATH, BUT BASICALLY THERE ARE ONLY TWO: REASON AND PRACTICE. TO ENTER BY REASON MEANS TO REALIZE THE ESSENCE THROUGH INSTRUCTION AND TO BELIEVE THAT ALL LIVING THINGS SHARE THE SAME TRUE NATURE, WHICH ISN&#39;T APPARENT BECAUSE IT&#39;S SHROUDED BY SENSATION AND DELUSION.</description>

      <description>Astrology: A Door to Religiousness
It is necessary that some matters be understood. First, it is necessary to know that, from a scientific point of view, the whole solar family is born out of the sun. The moon, Mars, Jupiter, and the rest of the planets, including this Earth, are all organic parts of the sun. Slowly, life on Earth came into being - from plants to man. Man is an organic part of the Earth; the Earth is an organic part of the sun.</description>

You are asking something impossible. It is almost as if I ask you: Can you be my sannyasin if I don’t want to be your master? You can see the absurdity of it. But why such a question arises in the first place has to be understood. It has to do with the whole past of humanity.\nPeople are Christians without being Christians; people are Hindus without being Hindus. Only formally do Christians accept Jesus as their master. It is not an intimate, sincere, total relationship. It is just by birth – it is an accidental relationship. They have not chosen to be Christians. They are born in a Christian home, or in a Jewish home, and they have been conditioned to believe that Jesus is your master, Moses is your master – poor Moses knows nothing about you, neither has Jesus any idea who you are. And this is true all over the world.\nReligion has nothing to do with your birth. By birth one cannot be Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan; but that’s how it has been happening. Religion has been joined with birth to deceive you. The best way to deceive a person is to give him the idea that what people are seeking, he has already got. This is the most refined way of cheating.\nA Christian never thinks of searching to find out what religion is, what it means to be a disciple, what it means to accept someone as your master. He has been deceived from birth to believe that he\n2\nalready has religion. Ready-made it has been given to him. No effort on his part has been made, no search, no seeking, no enquiry. He has a master in Jesus Christ, he has a holy book in THE BIBLE; everything is supplied by tradition, family, society.\nThey don’t leave any chance for you to enquire on your own; and the problem is, unless you enquire on your own you will never find what life is all about, what truth is, what these tremendous moments are, like when one becomes a disciple, when one finds a master.… You will never know those moments of ultimate rejoicing. You will never run in the street naked, shouting, “Eureka! I have found it!”\nArchimedes was not mad. He was one of the most important scientists of his time and of all times. And if he, finding a simple thing, a scientific fact, forgets all about clothing because he was in his bathtub when he found a certain principle for which he had been looking.…\nWhen you are looking continuously in all directions, knocking on all doors, you never know which door is the right door. Archimedes was puzzled for months because the king had told him, “If you are really a scientist you should find out one thing. Somebody, another king, has presented me with a crown of gold. I want to know whether it is pure gold, or if there is some mixture in it. Is any other metal mixed in with it? And I don’t want the crown to be cut. I don’t want you even to touch it. You have to find the answer without spoiling the beautiful present.”\nFor months Archimedes was troubled: how to find out? If he were allowed to cut a little piece of the crown it would have been possible to find out whether other metals were mixed in or not. When a question remains continuously with you for twenty-four hours, it takes you, by and by, close to the answer. The answer comes in a moment of relaxation. The question is a tension, but you can get the answer in relaxation only if the tension has been to its uttermost climax.\nIt had been so for months, and the king was asking every day. Archimedes was starting to feel embarrassed: a well known scientist cannot find such a small thing? People had started laughing at him. He could not sleep, he could not do anything – only one question.… That day, relaxing in his bathtub – which was full of water, completely full – as he sat in the tub, naturally some water flowed out to make a space for him. And something clicked in his mind. He weighed the water that had flowed out, and he found the principle. If pure gold is put in water, then a certain amount of water will come out. If some other metal is mixed in it, then a different amount of water will come out, because that certain metal will not have the same effect on water as the gold if it is pure.\nNow the crown need not be destroyed; it has just to be put in water, and another piece of pure gold of the same volume can be put in water and you can see how much water comes out from both. If it is exactly the same then the crown is of pure gold; if it is not, then there is a mixture. The finding was not something great. He had not found a master, or truth; he had not realized himself. He had not entered into nirvana. But such a small finding The question is not of small or great; the question is\nof finding yourself. The joy comes from finding, not what you find.\nArchimedes jumped out of his bathtub, ran out of his bathroom, and rushed into the street shouting, “Eureka!” A crowd followed him. They thought, “We were always thinking this man is crazy, now he has gone completely crazy; naked, he is going towards the palace!”\nHe reached the court naked, shouting “Eureka, I have found it!”\nThe king said, “It seems you must have found it. But where are your clothes?” That moment\nArchimedes became aware that he was naked.\nThe king said, “Your coming naked shows that you must have found it, because when someone finds something it is such a joy. Who cares about clothes? Who remembers about manners? You need not say anything to me; just your coming in this way has given me proof that you must have found it.”\nBut you have not found Christianity. You have never shouted, “Eureka!” You have not found Hinduism; you have not found anything that could have driven you into the street naked, shouting. This is why such a question arises.\nYou have been living on borrowed things. You can borrow things but you cannot borrow experiences. You can borrow money from someone, but you cannot borrow his love experience. You cannot say, “Just give me your love experience for two days, and I will return it with interest.” Love experience is not a commodity.\nYou are asking me, “Can you still be my master if I don’t wish to be a sannyasin?” There must be many misconceptions in your mind. As if it is something that the master has to do! So if the master accepts, that’s enough, you need not be a disciple, you need not be a sannyasin, you need not do anything.\nThat too is given by your idiotic tradition to you: Jesus is the savior, all that you need is to accept him as your savior, and that’s all. The whole responsibility is his. On your part only one thing is needed: to accept him as your savior. Nothing else is needed, no transformation in you.\nThe reality is just the opposite: the master does nothing. It is in your becoming a disciple that the whole mystery lies. It is in your surrender of the ego that the whole search comes to an authentic point. It is in putting your mind aside.\nThat is what sannyas is: an authentic discipleship. It means putting your mind aside. You have lived according to your mind up to now. If that is fulfilling, then there is no need for anybody to become a sannyasin.\nIf you feel you are blissful with your mind, then why bother about a master? Why carry an unnecessary load? Why become tethered? It is certain that as your mind is, it is nothing but anguish; it is suffering, misery, despair. But you are not ready to become a sannyasin. That means you are not ready to put your mind aside.\nTranslated into reality, you are not wishing to change even a little bit – not even your clothes, what to say about your mind? You are not ready even to hang a mala with my picture around your neck, how are you going to allow me to enter into your heart?\nYou want me to be your master and you are keeping yourself closed in every possible way. You are saying, “Would you like to come into my house?” and you are closing the doors in my face. On the one hand you are inviting me, on the other hand you are closing your doors and windows, so I cannot enter in any way.\nThe relationship between a master and a disciple is one of the greatest mysteries of existence.\nThe master does nothing – remember it always. He is only a presence. All that is done is done by the disciple. The presence of the master is helpful, just the presence. It is immensely nourishing. His presence gives you the guarantee that what has happened to him can happen to you; otherwise where are you going to find the evidence that things like that happen? The master’s only function is to give you tangible evidence.\nYou cannot make Jesus your master because he has been dead for two thousand years. The relationship between a master and a disciple is a living relationship.\nYou don’t get married to women who died two thousand years ago; otherwise, I think everybody would be marrying Cleopatra, Amrapali. Who will bother about ordinary women when you can marry Cleopatra? And Cleopatra cannot say no; she has been dead for a long time. But you are doing the same thing when you relate yourself to Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed.\nYou don’t understand a simple thing, that relating to a master is a bigger, far bigger love relationship; it is a far more crazy love affair. It cannot happen between somebody who is living and somebody who has been dead for thousands of years; the distance is too much. But people prefer to make Jesus, Mohammed, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, their master, for the simple reason that the master is not present, he cannot say no. He cannot tell you, “First you have to go through a transformation.” It is a one-way affair; the other party is absent.\nBut I am not absent, I am present. You cannot ask such a stupid question to me.\nIf you don’t wish to become a sannyasin – am I mad, that I should become a master to you? Why should I become a master to you? For what? You are not even wishing to be a sannyasin. You don’t want to give anything, and you want to get everything. Becoming your master I will be taking on your total responsibility. And you are not even wishing to be a sannyasin – which is nothing. At least my sannyas is the simplest that has ever existed on the earth.\nWhat is required of you? Even this seems to be too much. Then just don’t be bothered with the greater things of life. Go back to your hell. You are not meant to have eyes; perhaps to remain blind is your destiny. Remain blind.\nAsking such a question implies that a master is to do everything, the only thing needed is to be accepted by him, then your work is finished. Now you can go on doing all the nonsense that you have been doing. You can do it now even more without any guilt, without any fear, without any worry about the consequences, because now somebody has taken your responsibility.\nOmar Khayyam, one of the great poets of Persia, said, “Don’t stop me from enjoying women and wine. Don’t stop me – because God is forgiving; if I do not commit sin, then what will happen to God’s forgiveness? I have to commit sins just to keep God qualified, compassionate, forgiving. No sin is bigger than God’s compassion. Let me commit the worst: he is there.”\nYou see the logic of the man? It is perfectly clear. If God’s very quality is to forgive, then what is the fear of sin? And how much sin can you commit? God’s compassion is infinite. All your sins combined will still be finite, they cannot be infinite. If you can commit infinite sins you have become almost a God because you can do infinite things. Then there is no difference between you and God. You have infinity in your hands as much as God has.\nOmar Khayyam’s statement is significant because that’s what all religious people are doing: they put the responsibility on somebody, and then they go on doing their thing, hoping, believing that everything will be all right in the end. They have a great savior who will stand for them before God.\nYour question seems to be just throwing responsibility on me. And I am a very irresponsible person. I have never lived responsibly. From my very childhood everybody has been telling me, “Be responsible.” But I have always said, “I enjoy being irresponsible so much that I don’t see the point, why I should be responsible. You enjoy being responsible – be responsible. I never say to you, ‘Be irresponsible.’ Why do you bother about me? If my irresponsibilities are going to lead me to hell I am perfectly willing to go there, because anyway I don’t want to live with your saints.\n“I have lived with saints and I have lived with sinners, and I have seen that to be with sinners is far more colorful, far more pleasant, far more human. There is some song in it, some dance in it; there is laughter, there is life. To live with a saint is to live with a dead man, a corpse.”\nHave you ever been in a room alone with a corpse? Can you sleep? Can you eat? Can you drink? Can you laugh? The corpse will not interfere in any way, but just the presence of the corpse in the room is enough to prevent you from living. Do you see the great principles involved there? The corpse is not doing anything, and yet you cannot eat – you will feel like throwing up. You cannot sing. The corpse is not preventing you, the corpse is not going to hear it, but just the idea of singing when the corpse is there.…\nSaints are dead people. The more dead they are, the more they are thought to be saintly. To live with them is simply sickening. It is nauseating. They are so inhuman about everything. They themselves live mechanically, robot-like, and they won’t allow anybody else to live differently. They will make you feel guilty for everything.\nIn Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram – and he was a great saint, mahatma means great saint – you could not smoke. I know smoking is silly, but what is wrong in being silly? And if one enjoys it, once in a while to be silly is perfectly human. It should be acceptable. You can tell the person, “It will harm your health, your life will be reduced by five years.” But if you don’t want to live that long, it is perfectly good – because what are you going to do with five years more? You will smoke more!\nAnd it is not a healthy habit; but people who don’t smoke, they fall sick – and I have seen people who have been smoking continuously, chain-smokers, never falling sick. So all this is just guesswork. All that the smoker is doing is enjoying taking the smoke in and throwing it out. The smoke is warm, just like the mother’s milk, and the cigarette is exactly the mother’s nipple; he is again enjoying being a child.\nA cigarette is just a way of enjoying one’s childhood again; that’s why a cigarette is so relaxing. When you are worried, tense, you start looking for a cigarette. It helps; it is human. It will look really odd to go to your mother now, and say, ” I am so tense and worried” I think cigarettes are a good\nsubstitute. Don’t disturb these people; otherwise they will disturb women. Your mother may be dead – then you have to go to your wife, and she may be just mad at the idea that you have come with. She will think you are going nuts.\nCigarettes are such a simple substitute; don’t disturb people. When I see you smoking I feel sorry for\nyou, not because you are smoking but because you have to smoke. I think about your worries, not\nabout your smoking; that is nothing to be bothered about. I think about your anguish, your tension. I think that there must be something eating at your heart; otherwise why should you burn yourself with smoking? I never judge your smoking, that you are doing some wrong act. I see deeper. I see why you are smoking.\nBut no saint bothers about why you are smoking. For them smoking is a sin. In Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram if somebody was found to be smoking he was immediately turned out in disgrace; he had fallen. And the poor fellow was simply trying to relax. In fact his smoking was an indication that the ashram was not relaxing, that it was not a place where people could relax. Instead, it was a place where people became more tense. In fact, all the ashrams make you more tense.\nIt is a strange dilemma: they make you more tense, more worried. This world is not enough for them; they bring in hell and heaven and all kinds of consequences that you will have to suffer. Rather than helping you to get out of your tense mind, they make your mind more tense – and then you cannot smoke, then you cannot drink even tea or coffee; these are all prohibited because they are all relaxing.\nA relaxed person may not need to smoke unless playfully, once in a while, sitting with friends, when everybody is smoking and he does not want to play the saint. I used to go to parties when I was in the university. It was a problem because the host was worried that everybody would be drinking and I might feel left out. Knowing it from many other previous experiences, I had to go to the host and say, “Don’t be worried about me. You just give me Coca Cola as if I am also drinking with everybody.”\nBut he would say, “They will think you are also drinking alcohol.”\nI said, “Let them think that, it is no problem. What is the problem? It simply shows I am also human. I want to participate with them, I don’t want to be holier-than-thou. To me that attitude is ugly, that attitude is simply egoistic.\n“I cannot drink alcohol, because I don’t know what I will do after drinking. There is no problem – as far as I am concerned there is no problem, I can drink, because I don’t think that even though alcohol is called spirits, it can be spiritual, or it can enter into my spirit. It will just go through my kidneys and sooner or later pass out of the body. So there is not much of a problem. I am thinking of you, because I may do something, and that may create trouble for you! So just give me Coca Cola.”\nDrinking Coca Cola with people – they almost all glared at me! They all said, “You are also drinking?\nWe were worried that you would be here not drinking, and we would look like sinners.”\nI said, “No, I am a drunkard. You go on, you cannot compete with me” – because I could go on drinking Coca Cola as much as I wanted. But I felt happy that they were not feeling guilty. I felt that I had done something appropriate; I had been human.\nYour saints are not human. Gandhi was very particular about cleanliness. He followed the same idea: cleanliness is next to God. Now for me it is a trouble – there is no God, so only cleanliness remains. Not even next to God, just the first – there is no next. But I don’t come to look into your room, and into your bathroom. That seems to me evil. But Gandhi used to do that.\nHe would go into your room to see that everything is as it should be. He would have a look in your bathroom to see whether it was clean or not. But this is interfering in your privacy. I can talk about cleanliness, I can praise cleanliness. I can tell you the beauty of it; but then at least I should trust you, your intelligence, your privacy, and ultimately your responsibility to yourself. I am not responsible for you.\nBut this is not the way of the saints up to now. They have been after their disciples almost like detectives, making the disciple feel as guilty as possible. There is some arithmetic behind it.\nThe more guilty they make people feel, the bigger saints they are thought to be. Their height goes on becoming higher and higher as you go on sinking lower and lower. Their whole saintliness depends on your guiltiness. And to make you feel guilty is very simple: start condemning everything that is human, that is natural.\nOn my path the master is only a light. You can see in that light and go wherever you want to go. The master is not somebody who is continuously following you, forcing you. He is simply a presence. In his presence you become aware of your ultimate potential. You become aware of what you can be, and what you are not. You become aware of your hypocrisy.\nSannyas is nothing but dropping your hypocrisy.\nAnd you say to me, “I don’t wish to be a sannyasin.” You insist on remaining a hypocrite, a split person. Making me your master, you will be more split. You will become more guilty because you have made somebody a master and you are not a disciple to him.\nIt will look unkind to you that I refuse. But it is a refusal out of compassion, not out of unkindness. I refuse to be a master of anyone who is not wishing to be a disciple.\nThe meaning of the word ‘disciple’ is beautiful. It means one who is ready to learn. And there is much to be learned. Almost everything has to be learned, because whatsoever you know is not learning, it is knowledge, completely rotten knowledge. You have taken it from others; you have not searched for it, looked for it, enquired about it. It is not your own, you cannot say “Eureka!” Not for a single thing can you say “Eureka!” And a man who is ready to learn, a disciple, finds every moment like Archimedes – life goes on revealing new secrets every moment.\nHow can I become a master to you? You are not ready to be vulnerable to me. You are not ready to be open to me, you are not ready to listen to me, you are not ready to come along with me. You want to remain as you are, what you are, yet you want one more guarantee: you want me to become responsible so that you feel less guilty – at least you have a master. But that is not going to help.\nYou can have all the masters of the world – and that’s the beauty of dead masters, they cannot say no. You can accept all the masters of the world, be a disciple of all the masters of the world. There are people who are following Zen, who are following Sufism, who are following Tao, anything. Neither Lao Tzu can prevent them, nor Bodhidharma can prevent them, nor Jalaluddin Rumi can prevent them. Those people are gone, just words echoing are left.\nBut I am yet in the flesh.\nI am yet not only a word.\nMy word is still living.\nIf you want to have any contact with me, you will have to be ready to travel with me. It is a long journey. Much of the load that you are carrying will have to be dropped. Much of the mind which you are thinking is very valuable will prove just junk. Much of your character that you valued so much will prove nothing but forced discipline.\nDiscipline can be forced so much that it becomes unconscious. People are behaving in the right manner – are not stealing, are not harming others, not hurting others – but it is not their conscious choice.\nI have heard about a retired military general... it was a case after the first world war. The general had lived his whole life in the army – and not only his life; his father was a general, his father’s father was a general. As far back as he could remember their family had been in the army. It was in his blood. From the very beginning he was disciplined in the manners of the army.\nHe was retired now, the war was over. One day he was carrying a bucket full of eggs, and a man just played a joke on him; the man shouted, “Attention!” and the general stood to attention, dropping the bucket and all the eggs on the road. He was very angry; his eggs were all finished. And he said, “What kind of a joke is this?”\nThe man said, “But can’t I say ‘Attention!’? It has nothing to do with you. You could have carried your bucket. I was not telling you to drop it.”\nThe general said, “You don’t understand, it has gone into my blood, into my bones. Even in the night, if somebody says, ‘Attention!’ I will jump out of the bed and be at attention. Only then will I realize that it is a joke – but first I will be in position.”\nThis is discipline. Your morality, your character, are nothing but forced disciplines. They have become unconscious, and anything that is unconscious is of no value at all. Coming along with me you will have to understand that your morality is just imposed. You are an impostor pretending to be moral, not knowing even the ABC of morality. Your character is nothing.\nWhen I applied for a professorship, they asked me for a character certificate. I said, “I cannot produce one.”\nThe education minister said, “But why not?”\nI said, “For the simple reason that I haven’t found a man of character from whom I would like to have a character certificate.”\nHe said, “You are something. You can’t find a man of character?”\nI said, “No, I can’t find a man of character. And how can I have a character certificate from somebody\nto whom I cannot give a character certificate?”\nI knew my vice-chancellor and I told him, “I cannot take a character certificate from you because I\ncannot give a character certificate to you. I know you perfectly well.”\nI knew my head of department, who was a very loving man, who loved me. But he himself said, “I cannot give you a character certificate because I don’t have any character and you know it perfectly wel l.”\nI said to the education minister, “You give me a character certificate, and I will expose you – I will just call a press conference today. You give me a character certificate and I will tell the press conference what kind of character you have.”\nHe started perspiring. He said, “You just take your appointment later.”\nBut I said, “What about the character certificate? – because it has to be attached to the application.” He said, “Don’t be worried.”\nI said, “No, it is a question of principle. If everybody needs a character certificate then I will write a character certificate for myself. That’s the only man I know perfectly well who has character. About anybody else it is at the most guesswork.”\nHe said, “Do whatsoever you want, just please leave me alone. You take your order.” So I wrote a character certificate for myself. He said, “But please don’t sign it in your own name because I will be in trouble.”\nThen I said, “Whose name have I to sign?”\nHe said, “Anybody’s name but not your own name.”\nSo I signed it in the name of one of my professors. He said, “But you are signing with somebody else’s name. I know this man, S.S. Roy; he is your professor. What are you going to tell him?”\nI said, “You don’t be worried. This a copy of the original, the original I will take from him.” I said, “This is done everyday; the original is taken, then copies are made. This is just the reverse: the copy is given to you, the original I will make.”\nI went to S.S. Roy. I told him that this had happened and, “This is the character certificate I have\nwritten. You give me the original.”\nHe looked at the certificate. He said, “You should have come to me, because you have not written anything good. I would have given you a beautiful character certificate.”\nI said, “It was something spontaneous. That man was in a difficulty and I could not write more than\nthis about myself. What more can I write?”\nHe said, “But this is not a character certificate at all, because you are saying that you are a human\nbeing – this is very ordinary. You ask me to sign it, and it says that you have all the weaknesses of\nhuman beings, that one cannot trust you, you are not reliable. Now I have to sign it,” he said, “and you will show it to people.”\nI said, “No, I will not show it. The original I will give to you. The original you can keep in case it is\nneeded.”\nHe said, “Then it is okay because I don’t want people to see that I have written this character certificate about you. I love you and I know you. These are not your qualities.”\nI said, “But when I have to write about myself, do you think I should write, ‘He is the only begotten son of God’? Do you want me to be crucified? Once was enough.”\nComing along with me you will have to drop almost the whole of you. Only the essential will remain, only that which you cannot drop. Even if you want to drop it you cannot. Only that will remain.\nIt is a great surgery in which all the cancerous growth that surrounds you has to be cut out completely. It is painful, it is hard. Just because it is so painful and so hard, I make it as light as possible, as joyous as possible. I try to make it a joke for the simple reason that the task is hard, and it is good to pass the dark night of the soul with laughter, with gossiping, with joking, with dancing, with singing. It is good to pass the dark night of the soul with joy.\nWhat is the point of crying and weeping and mourning and wearing the black habits of the Christian priests? The night is dark enough, why make it darker? To transform yourself, to change, is painful enough; why make it more miserable?\nOnce I was operated on, a little operation. I continued to joke with the doctor. He said, “You please wait. Don’t make me laugh because I may do something wrong. Leave me alone. I was saying from the very beginning that you need chloroform; otherwise you will go on talking and you will disturb me. But you said local anesthesia will do. So we have given” – he was doing the operation on my finger – “so we have given you local anesthesia. But it was wrong – you don’t leave us alone, you just go on joking!”\nI said, “Lying down on a surgical table, is it not the right place to joke? And will it not be helpful to you to be laughing and enjoying and doing your work? Just the way a painter paints, a surgeon should do his work. Why make it sad and It is already painful; make it light, don’t make it heavier.”\nHence, my sannyas is a rejoicing. You say you are not wishing to rejoice with me. You say you are not going to laugh with me. You say you are not going to dance with me, sing with me. Then for what are you wanting me to be your master? To make you more sad? Are you not sad enough? To make you more guilty? Have not the Christian priests done enough? Do you want me to make a heavier cross? Is not Jesus’ cross weighty enough for you? For what do you want me to be your master?\nAnd to be your master or not, that has to be left to me; you are not to be concerned about it. Your whole concern should be, can you be a disciple? “How can I be a disciple?” should be your question. You are not going to be a master so why bother about the master? That is my business. And I know my business perfectly well. You just leave it to me – you do your part. And if you succeed in doing your part you will not go empty-handed from my door. But first things first. You should be ready to do your part.\nBecoming a sannyasin is not just changing the robe and changing the name; those are just playful things. I could have chosen any color. Blue is good, the color of the ocean. Green is good, the color of the whole of nature. I could have chosen any color.\nI have chosen red for two reasons. One, because red in the East has been the color of sannyasins for centuries. I have not chosen it because it has been the color of the sannyasins, so that my sannyasins should also be part of that tradition. No, I have chosen it to sabotage that tradition, because all those sannyasins were serious people: heavy, dull, mediocre.\nI wanted to bring a new breeze into the world of sannyas, and to disturb the definition of the sannyasin, which had become completely ossified. I created confusion. Now in India it is very difficult to know who is who. My sannyasins are laughing, enjoying, dancing, and the people cannot understand what is the matter because sannyasins have never done such things.\nAnd secondly, I chose red because red has become associated with communism. I wanted to sabotage that idea too, that red is anybody’s monopoly. Just to disturb these two I chose red. But this is just playful.\nYou will have to think about sannyas in its deepest meanings. It means that you have found someone whose eyes can see farther than your eyes can see, whose reach of the hand goes higher than the reach of your hand. You have found someone that you feel jealous of. You would like to have this serenity, this peace, this silence, this song. Then be prepared on your part.\nI am ready, I have been long ready.\nAnd don’t miss the opportunity, because I will not be here forever. Today I am here, tomorrow I may not be here. So if you want in some way to use my insight, my vision, my experience, if you want to become a part of my universe, then don’t miss a single moment, because nothing can be said about the next moment. I may not be here, and then your getting ready will be pointless. Now I am here, and you are not ready.\nThat has been happening again and again in the past. It is said the day Gautam Buddha died a man came running. Buddha had told his disciples, “This is my last meeting with you in the body. I am going to leave the body. Before I leave, if you have any more questions left” – he had been answering for forty-two years – “if anything is still left in anybody’s mind, ask it, because I won’t be here anymore.”\nThe disciples were crying, weeping. What can you ask? For forty-two years Buddha had been answering even those questions which you had not asked. He had been answering questions which you had wrongly asked. But he had answered rightly. He was not only answering you, he was also creating questions for you. In forty-two years he had done everything that was possible. Now, what to ask at the last moment?\nThey said, “No, we are just grateful.”\nBuddha closed his eyes, he moved the first step inwards – that is, he moved away from the body to the mind. The second step: he moved from the mind to the heart. The third step he was just going\nto take, from the heart to the feeling of am-ness, asmita. It cannot be called “I” – it is far more refined – just am-ness. And then... the last jump into nothingness. While he was just moving in, the man came running.\nHe said, “But I have a question.”\nThe disciples said, “Now don’t disturb him. Where have you been? He has passed through your village at least thirty times.”\nHe said, “I know, but sometimes there was such a crowd of customers in my shop. Sometimes I was engaged in my son’s marriage; sometimes my wife was sick – and so on and so forth. I always thought, next time when he comes I will go to him. Just now I heard that he is leaving the world. What about my question?”\nThe people said, “You seem to be an idiot. Thirty times he passed, and thirty times you missed. And\nnow, when he has just taken leave of us... now it cannot be done.”\nBut Buddha came back. He opened his eyes, he said, “No, let him ask. Let him be answered because I don’t want it to be known in history, for the coming generations, that a Buddha was alive and yet somebody returned from his door empty-handed. Let me do my part. If he is ready – and I can see he is ready; my death has been a shock to him and has made him ready. I am happy that even my death has helped somebody to be ready, to listen.”\nHe answered his question. The question was not philosophical, theological, intellectual. The question was really authentic, sincerely spiritual. But that man had been missing for so many years, just because of the idea, “Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, any time Buddha comes and goes, I can go and meet him and ask.”\nHe asked – this was the last question to Buddha – “How can I be in a position so that whether you\nare in the body or not, your presence will remain available to me? What can I do?”\nHe had asked a real religious question. He was asking, “What can I do so that your presence remains available to me? This time I have missed – when you were in the body. But I don’t want to miss forever.”\nBuddha gave him the instructions for meditation, vipassana; how to be aware of your breathing; how to be aware, silently watchful of the breath going out, coming in, going out, coming in...”so slowly, slowly you can be separate from your breathing. The moment you are separate from your breathing my presence will be available, because you are separate from your body just as I am separate from my body.”\nIf a disciple is ready, even a dead master can be alive. If the disciple is not ready, then even a living master cannot do anything. It all depends on the disciple.\nCHAPTER 2\nHere we call work, worship\n2 April 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS WORSHIPPING IN THE COMMUNE RELATED TO MEDITATION? WHY DON’T WE HAVE ANY\nMEDITATION TIME SEPARATE FROM WORSHIPPING?\nIt has been one of the most dangerous ideas down the centuries that life can be divided into separate parts. Life is indivisible, it is an organic whole. The moment you divide it you kill it. This is one of the most fundamental things in my approach towards life: I take it as a whole.\nAnd remember, the whole is more than the sum total of its parts. In the world of machines, the whole is exactly the sum total of its parts; there is nothing more in it. A clock is nothing more than all its parts put in a particular arrangement; it functions. Take the parts apart, and the functioning disappears. But you can put the parts together again, and the functioning starts again. The functioning of the mechanism is not something separate.\nLife is totally different from a machine. If you cut a man into different parts, life will disappear. Now you cannot put those parts together. And even if you manage somehow to put those parts together, life is not going to appear again. It categorically proves one thing, that life is not the sum total of its parts – it is something more, it is something plus. And that “plus” is the real essence of your being.\nBut down the ages all the religions have been committing a crime: the crime of dividing the indivisible. But it was favorable to them. A divided man is a dead man, and to control the dead is the easiest thing in the world.\nAn undivided man is an individual. That’s exactly the meaning of the word “individual” – indivisible. The individual is dangerous, he is alive. You cannot enslave him, you cannot oppress him, you cannot exploit him. You cannot do anything against his wish. His individuality gives him freedom to think, to express, to be.\nDivisions can be made in very subtle ways.For example, “Religion should be separate from the state.” What kind of stupidity is this? If religion is something real, something that vibrates in your being, something that you breathe, live, then wherever you are – in the church, in the office, in the marketplace, it does not matter – religion is your very breathing. It is going to be with you. Then it is going to decide every step that you take, every word that you utter, every gesture that you make.\nHow can you divide religion from art? A religious man painting is not in any way separate from his religious being. While painting he is going to paint religion; whatever he paints is going to be colored by his religion. The way he lives, the way he loves, the way he dances – all is going to be in his painting. The painting of a religious man, whatsoever the subject matter of the painting, will have some fragrance of religion in it; it is inevitable, there is no way to avoid it.\nSometimes you may not be able to see this, because things are very subtle. A man of meditation, silence, serenity, is going to have a different kind of dance from a man who is in anguish, tension, worry, despair. A man who is living his life totally, intensely, moment to moment, and a man who is thinking of committing suicide – both can dance, but their dances will have different qualities. The person who is thinking of committing suicide, his dance will have the shadow of death in it. It will stink of death, of a dead body. His movements will not be movements of life.\nThe other man, who loves and lives totally and has a silent space within himself – that’s what I call meditation – his dance will also have a silence surrounding it. His movements, his gestures will have a grace, a beauty, a fragrance of their own.\nYou cannot divide man into parts.\nYour question is, “Here in our commune, there is no separate time for meditation.…” It is our basic approach. We cannot have a separate time for meditation. Meditation should be spread all over your life: eating, sleeping, taking a bath, or just having a walk, or just sitting doing nothing. Meditation should be in all these actions, inactions, activities, non activities. The thread of meditation should continue underground, whatever you are working at.\nA great master, Nan In, was chopping wood. The king of the country had come to see him. He had heard so much about Nan In that finally he could not resist the temptation to go and see the man. Just as he entered the monastery, near the gate was a man perspiring in the hot sun, chopping wood.\nNaturally the king thought, “This man must be able to direct me to where I can find the master” – because it was a vast monastery with five hundred monks living in it. So he asked the man, who was Nan In himself, “Please forgive me for interrupting you; you are so absorbed in chopping wood, you have not even seen that I have been standing here for a few minutes, waiting. But then I thought it is better to interrupt you because you are not going to see me of your own accord.”\nThe man said, “I am sorry, but this is how my life is. Whatever I am doing I am doing it totally. Nothing of me remains to do anything else. Chopping wood, I am simply chopping wood. There is nobody else other than the chopper of wood. So, no need to be embarrassed. What do you want?”\nHe said, “I want to see the master, Nan In.”\nNan In said, “You go directly into that hut and wait. The master will be coming soon.”\nThe king went and waited there. Nan In took a shower, put on his master’s robe, and came in from the back door. But the king was very puzzled, because both men looked so alike. He thought, “It is almost an impossibility. There are not two men alike in the whole world, and just in this monastery, within a few hundred yards I have seen a man exactly like this man.”\nNan In said, “You wanted to see master Nan In – master Nan In is now here.”\nThe king said, “That I will enquire about later on. First I want to know who was chopping wood at the gate.”\nNan In laughed. He said, “At that time I was a chopper of wood. Now I am going to chop your head; now I am a master. We live each moment, moment to moment, but we are indivisible. The chopper was also master Nan In. If you had eyes you could have seen my involvement with the movement, my totality of action, my intensity of being.\n“If you had eyes you could have seen him there; you would not have asked about master Nan In. You had already met him, but you didn’t know. Now I am a chopper of heads. That’s the function of a master: to make you so egoless, to make you so thoughtless that you are almost without a head, just the heart pulsating with love, with compassion. Have you come only to ask some questions? Are you really a seeker? Are you ready to lose something?”\nThe king was just confused, shocked, even afraid of the man. He had never been afraid of anybody, but this man was simply crazy – he was talking of chopping his head!\nThe king said, “You have confused me too much and I am almost falling apart. Please forgive me this time. I will come another time, because I have forgotten for what I came.”\nNan In said, “You need not come again. I am going to come to you, and I will follow you wherever you go. Now you cannot escape, because I can see something really authentic in you. Yes, it is unconscious; you are not aware of it, much garbage is hiding it. You think you are a king. Even sitting before me you are still thinking you are a king. This is garbage – you are just a beggar. And the beggar that I am is really a king.”\nThe king said, “I don’t understand all these puzzles. Please talk to me without puzzling me.”\nNan In said, “There is no puzzle in it, it is simple. I am a king because I don’t need anything in the world. You are a beggar; although you have a big empire, your desires are unending. You are desiring more and more and more. The mind that goes on desiring more is the mind of a beggar. And the consciousness that is content with itself as it is, utterly content, is the consciousness of an emperor.\n“Strange,” he said. “You think you are a king, and you look on me as a beggar. The reality is just the opposite. Go back – and I will be coming to visit you.” And Nan In followed the king continuously till he made him aware of his innermost treasure.\nIt is dangerous to go to a master, because then escape is almost impossible. Wherever you go – even if you go to Santa Fe – I am there. Nothing can save you. Once a master has seen within you a heart that can grow, that can expand, that can become universal, he is not going to leave you.\nI don’t need to go to Santa Fe. I have my own ways, far more subtle than Nan In’s. I am continually there; they are talking only about me, they cannot talk about anything else. Whom are they befooling? Whether you talk for me or against me does not matter, just go on continuously talking about me. That’s enough; that is going to change you.\nHere, in the commune, whatever you are doing Here we call work, worship, for the simple reason\nthat work is not just work, it is meditation also. That’s why we call it worship. Other than this we don’t have any God to worship. We have only this existence around us. So you can worship it as a gardener, you can worship it as a farmer, you can worship it as a roadmaker, you can worship any way you choose to. But whatever you are doing, you are doing with existence.\nSo the question is, if you are doing it lovingly, if you are doing it meditatively, and if, while you are doing it, you are nowhere else, you are just there with all of your being, nothing is missing – then work becomes worship. Work becomes worship because meditation has entered into it.\nBut I can understand your question, because all the religions have preached that there should be a separate time for meditation. That is just idiotic. It is as if somebody is saying there should be a separate time for breathing, that one hour in the morning you breathe and then forget about it, and for twenty-three hours you do other things. You need not be disturbed by having to breathe; you can do other things, breathing continues.\nA thousand and one things continue in your body: the blood goes on circulating, the pulse goes on functioning, the heart goes on beating.… Scientists say the body of man is perhaps the greatest miracle in existence because so much is going on in it. Almost seven million living cells are continuously working within you. You are the biggest city in the world.\nSeven million living beings are living in you, and they are doing all kinds of work and doing it perfectly, without any guidance and without any education, without anybody being the overseer – I mean no God as overseer. You may go on doing anything, your organic processes continue.\nTo me meditation is an organic process. To other religions it was not; hence, all those religions have failed. They were bound to fail. It is not an accident, it was destined; their very base was wrong. What they called meditation was nothing but some kind of thinking. The Christian was thinking of Christ, praying to God with folded hands, kneeling down. He knows neither whether God exists or not, nor whether Jesus Christ is really a messiah or just a charlatan. He knows nothing, but out of fear, out of misery, out of anguish, he is praying; and this, Christianity calls meditation.\nAnd what is he asking God? He is asking for all those things which he is missing here in this life, which he cannot manage to create here for himself. He is asking God, “At least in the other life, give them to me; I have suffered enough.” He is asking – in fact, deep down it is a complaint.\nAll prayers are complaints; otherwise, what have you got to pray for if there is no complaint? Every prayer simply means you are condemning God. You are saying, “You are doing it wrong. Please do it this way.”\nEven Jesus on the cross condemns God when he says, “Have you forsaken me?” What does he mean? One thing is certain, he means that he knows better than God. He knows that somewhere God has gone wrong. He is angry, he is complaining. He wants God to do a miracle, to prove to the world that he is his only begotten son, that he has been sent by him. He is his messenger and he has sent him for the whole world’s salvation.\nBut from the skies no voice comes. On the clouds no angels appear with their harps, playing “Alleluia” – no sign of God anywhere. In anger Jesus shouts, “Have you forsaken me?” He is saying, “Have you betrayed me? Have you gone against your word? You have left me in this helpless situation. And I believed in you!” This is the moment to prove that God is love. This is the moment to prove that God comes to save those who trust in him. But nobody comes.\nAll prayers are complaints. All prayers are saying to God, “We know better than you do.”\nOne man came to me – his wife was dying. He was a very religious man. Every day from three o’clock in the morning up to seven – for four hours – he was doing all kinds of crazy things. He had so many gods. In India they are not so miserly about gods. About everything else they are poor, but about gods they are the richest people in the world: thirty-three million gods. So everybody who is really religious has a whole roomful.\nThirty-three million of course you cannot... but a few representatives, the topmost, the bigshots, you can keep around. This man had at least sixty. Now, sixty gods, and only four hours – you can see, it was not much time. He was in such a hurry, doing a prayer to this god and rushing to another, then rushing to another, and looking at his watch continuously because in four hours he has to finish. And the fear that if he leaves any god, and the god becomes angry.…\nSuch a religious man – and his wife was dying, and the doctors were not able to do anything. They simply said, “She has lost the will to live. Deep down she does not want to live; hence, no medicine is effective.” Unless you have a will to live you lose resistance; you really want to die. Just medicines cannot do much unless a great support from your will is there.\nSo he came to me one day and said, “What should I do? I have done four hours of prayers each day my whole life, and still my wife is dying, and out of those sixty gods not a single one is helping. And I cry and weep.”\nI said, “Please answer me one question. Do you think yourself more intelligent than God?” He said, “No. How can I think myself more intelligent than God?”\nThen I said, “If God wants your wife to be freed from the body you should be happy, you should be thankful. But your prayer is against God’s will. Those sixty gods that you have cannot help you in any way. You are not a religious man at all.”\nBut he said, “I have done prayer four hours every day for years.”\nI said, “You can pray twenty-four hours, that too will not make any change, because your whole\nattitude is wrong. You are demanding from existence, you are not surrendering to existence.”\nMeditation is a surrender, it is not a demand. It is not forcing existence your way, it is relaxing into the way existence wants you to be. It is a let-go.\nBut all the religions have been doing prayers in the name of meditation. And what kind of stupid prayers! In fact any prayer that a man can do is going to be stupid. “Don’t let my wife die” – do you think that is something very intelligent? If that dodo was a little bit intelligent – God was making him free, and he is praying against his own freedom.\nBut if you look in the scriptures you will be surprised what kind of prayers are there. In the VEDAS, the most holy scriptures of the Hindus, the great seers I cannot even conceive how for centuries\nthose people have been called great seers. They should be called the great blind men! Seers! – they were praying to God: “Please increase the milk of my cow, decrease the milk of the cow of my enemy, my neighbor. This time let rains fall only on my field.” Great seers, great saints and sages – and these are their prayers. But what else can you ask?\nThe Christian asks, “Give me my daily bread.” Don’t you have anything else to ask? Can’t you produce even your daily bread? Even that has to be provided by God? So what are you doing here? Even your daily bread is not to be created by you. Just by providing daily bread to all these millions of Christians for centuries, God must have gone bankrupt!\nNobody ever thinks of God. Just seeing his misery and anguish I declared, “There is no God!” In just a single blow I finished all his misery, all his trouble, all his anguish – past, present, future, everything; I made it completely clean. Now, let everybody produce his own daily bread and, if you have some intelligence, a little butter will also do – but don’t torture God anymore. He is not there; he has never been there.\nWhy should you keep a separate time for meditation? It is based on the idea of the separation of the sacred and profane. But in life there is no separation of the sacred and the profane. Life is one, so totally one that you can call something sacred if you want, you can call it profane if you want.\nChristians call sex sin, and Tantra, a great Eastern philosophy, calls sex sacred, the most significant life energy – because all transformation is going to happen through that energy. Don’t condemn it. There are people who are condemning sex continuously in every possible way.\nYou can take anything there are Zen people in the East who say that even sipping a cup of tea in\nthe morning can be something sacred. And they have made it sacred. If you have seen, in a Zen monastery they have a small temple for tea ceremonies, and when anybody goes to the tea ceremony he enters into a sacred space.\nHe leaves his shoes outside; there are special wooden sandals provided inside. Everybody is silent, because the samovar is boiling the tea and a beautiful music is coming out of it. It has to be listened to. People sit on their knees, just the way they sit in the temple, around the samovar. They all listen silently to the boiling noise of the tea, and they smell the fresh and rejuvenating fragrance of the tea. And absolute silence falls on them.\nThen the server, who is usually a woman, comes; and in a very sacred manner she provides cups and saucers, which are all handmade. In a Zen monastery they don’t use cups and saucers purchased in the market; those are produced inhumanly, mechanically, for nobody particular. They are just for the market.\nIn the Zen monastery they make their own cups, their own saucers, with love, with meditation. Something of their love and meditation certainly enters into their cups and saucers and pots. And the way the woman places them before you – she places them as if she is serving a god. Christians don’t even know how to move Jesus’ statue from one place to another.\nThen she pours the tea; just the sound of the tea being poured is listened to – no talk at all. And then people start sipping tea, enjoying it, forgetting the whole world. Just sipping tea has become sacred. It depends on you.\nThere is nothing profane in the world, nothing sacred in the world. The world is neutral. Now it depends on you what you want to make of it. Meditation makes it sacred; then every act becomes meditative.\nI am reminded of a butcher in Japan who was considered to be a great master – and he was a butcher! The whole day he was cutting animals and selling meat; that was his business. One Buddhist scholar could not believe that this man was thought to be a saint. He was simply a scholar. He went to the butcher and said, “This is something absolutely mad. Who are the people who think that you are a saint? How can a butcher be a saint?”\nThe butcher laughed. He answered, “Just by mixing meditation in the butchery. When I am cutting up an animal I am not angry, I am not hateful. I am full of love, I am full of compassion. I have great hope that next time he will be born in a human form; perhaps he will become a buddha. With all my blessings I am sending him on a new journey, releasing him from this prison.\n“And moreover, my father was a butcher, my forefathers were butchers, and I am a poor butcher. I have never told anybody that I am a saint. If people think so, that’s their business. You should go and argue with them.\n“As far as I am concerned, I am absolutely content with my profession because whatever you do, the question is not what you are doing but how you are doing it. The question is not the act; the question is the consciousness with which the act is being performed. Yes, I am killing animals, but I know that they will be killed anyway. If I am not killing them, somebody else will kill them. And he will not kill them with such love, with such compassion. How can I leave this profession?\n“These animals are going to be killed. If I don’t kill them somebody else will kill them and he is not going to kill them with such meditation, with such love. So I would be leaving these poor animals in the hands of some butcher. I cannot do that. If I am going to be thrown into hell for being a butcher, that is acceptable. But I cannot leave these poor innocent animals in the hands of somebody who knows nothing of love.”\nCan you see the point of this butcher? It is very subtle. He is ready to suffer in hell if that is going to be the consequence of his actions. But he cannot leave these poor animals in the hands of somebody who will simply kill them and not even bother about what he is doing.\nHe said, “I am so concerned with these animals and I love them so much – I cannot leave them in\nsomebody else’s hands. Whatsoever happens to me, that I am ready to face.”\nI can see why the people who could understand called him a master, a saint. He never gave a sermon, he never preached anything. He was illiterate, he knew nothing of the scriptures, but he lived religion in a very irreligious situation; that’s something tremendously important. He lived religion in something which is very irreligious. And yet he managed to live religiously. He must have been a great alchemist who transformed the whole act, gave it a new quality; something utterly profane and ugly became so beautiful, so graceful.\nIt is said that his fame spread far and wide and people started coming to see him while he was cutting up animals. Even the emperor of Japan came to see him while he was cutting because he had heard that the way he cuts, nobody has ever cut – such grace, such love, tears flowing from his eyes. And the miracle was that although human beings were not able to understand, perhaps the animals were able to understand.\nOrdinarily when you want to kill an animal he tries to escape, but from this butcher no animal tried to escape. He hugged the animal. The animal was not bound by anything, tied with anything. He was completely free. It was as if deep down he wanted to die by this man’s hand.\nAnd the emperor asked one thing, about the knife that he used to kill the animals. The knife looked so shiny, as if it had just been sharpened. The emperor asked, “Do you sharpen your knife every day?”\nHe said, “No, this is the knife my father used, and his father used, and it has never been sharpened. But we know exactly the points where it has to cut the animal so there is a minimum of pain possible – through the joints where two bones meet. The knife has to go through the joint, and those two bones that meet there go on sharpening the knife. And that is the point where the animal is going to feel the minimum pain.\n“For three generations we have not sharpened the knife. A butcher sharpening a knife simply means he does not know his art” – he used the word “art” – “He does not know the art and he does not know how to do it lovingly.”\nMy commune is in meditation twenty-four hours a day; whatever you are doing, or not doing, is immaterial. Just be loving, be alert, do it with joy. Whatever you are doing, do it as if this is the greatest thing in the world at this juncture of time. It may be just cutting the grass, watering the road; it may be anything. Washing the floor, do it as if the whole existence depends on what you are doing, it is indispensable; without it, the whole universe will collapse.\nWhen you do anything with such intensity, with such love, with such respect, as if without it the whole universe will collapse, then there is no need to have a separate time for meditation. And those who are doing meditations as separate from life are simply deceiving themselves and nobody else.\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi teaches his people, “Do transcendental meditation ten minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening, and that’s enough.” And what is his transcendental meditation? Just repeat any stupid name... go on repeating “Rama, Rama, Rama” – that is a Hindu name – or,\n“Ave Maria, Ave Maria, Ave Maria.” Any name, in fact your own name will do – just go on repeating it.\nRepeat it as fast as possible because that’s the whole secret of the technique.\nIf for ten minutes you go on repeating a single word fast enough continuously, you autohypnotize yourself. After just four or five minutes you start falling into a deliberate kind of sleep which is called hypnosis. Yes, after ten minutes you will feel good, you will feel fresh, you will feel relaxed. So nothing is wrong with it – but it is not meditation. It is just a way of resting, having a good nap.\nYou can do it, but remember, it has nothing to do with meditation. It is perfectly good, healthy, psychologically and physically relaxing, but that’s all it is. It has nothing to do with transcendence; it is not transcendental at all. It is not going to take you into your innermost being, it is not going to take you into some higher state of consciousness; it is not going to take you anywhere. After ten minutes you will be back where you were. You will remain the same person. You will not be transformed by it.\nAnd unless something transforms you it is not meditation: something that makes you a new being, a new man, a new consciousness; which knows no fear, which knows no greed, which knows no hate; which knows nothing of those dark emotions, sentiments – ugly, sick, nauseating. ... a new consciousness, which knows only that which uplifts you, that which goes on uplifting you – there is no end to it.\nMeditation brings you to a state where you are above the stars, bigger than the whole universe. That experience is what I call transformation, illumination, enlightenment.\nSo don’t be worried that there are not separate times for you to meditate. It is not an oversight, it is done with full consideration. I don’t want to give you the impression that meditation can be done separately from your life and its work.\nCHAPTER 3\nMy religion is a godless religion\n30 June 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nNOW THAT GOD IS DEAD HOW CAN WE QUICKLY DISPOSE OF HIS REMAINS?\nGod is not dead now, he has been dead always, so the question of disposing of his remains does not arise. God has never existed and cannot exist, for the simple reason that the whole existence is godliness. To divide God and existence, the creator and the creation, is a stupid duality.\nOne has to see the implications of it: God creating a world – from where? Something must have existed as a building material before God created the world. And if he can create the world like a magician then he is an idiotic magician. One can see the world as a proof. Is this the world a wise man will create? – to say nothing of a wise God.\nThis world shows absolutely that there is nobody behind it consciously creating it; otherwise all the nonsense that exists here should not be. God created the world at a certain time, at a certain date – according to Christians, who are the most foolish of all the religions, he created the world four thousand and four years before Jesus was born. It must have been Monday, the first of January, or perhaps the first of April – that seems to be more appropriate.\nAnd what did he create? In three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought – and this is the creation of God. His highest creation is man, and the whole of humanity is on the verge of\ncommitting a global suicide. This God must be some kind of a sadist. It is better that we simply forget all about God.\nIn the courts, THE BIBLE is presented to take oaths on. It is full of lies. In these two thousand years since Jesus, almost everything in THE BIBLE has become a lie. What about Charles Darwin? What about Albert Einstein?\nSometimes I wonder: have we lost all intelligence? It would be better to provide Albert Einstein’s book to take an oath on. THE BIBLE is so full of obscenity, it is an insult to every court to have a BIBLE inside it. It is a contempt of court. And wonder of wonders, you have to take an oath that you will speak only the truth!\nJesus is born out of a virgin girl – I cannot take any oath on such rubbish. If a virgin girl can give birth to Jesus then everything is right; then there is no lie anywhere in the world, all is truth, you cannot lie – but this is impossible in the very nature of things.\nThe Old Testament says that God created the world. He created two daughters and made love to both of them. Now, the father making love to his own daughters – and this is a religious book! And this is your God! Hang him if you can find him.\nAnd this is not only so about Christianity, it is more or less the same with all religions. No sane person can believe in God; only insane, retarded, utterly mediocre people can believe in God.\nI have not found a single reason or argument given by thousands of priests of all the religions which has any validity. Still God continues to be worshipped. You have made him out of your foolishness, and you are worshipping him, praying to him. This is not the way to change the world, or man, or his consciousness.\nSo please don’t say, “Now that God is dead.” He has never been in the first place, so he cannot be\ndead.\nI agree on many points with that madman Friedrich Nietzsche, but I don’t agree on this point – that God is dead. Not that God is not dead – he has never been anywhere. Only existence is. Yes, there is a possibility of consciousness evolving, higher and higher. The moment consciousness comes to its highest peak it does not find any God there. It finds immense beauty, immense silence, absolute nothingness.\nThis I am saying on my own authority and through my own experience. You cannot go beyond absolute peace, silence, ecstasy. It goes on growing, but you never can go beyond it.\nHence, my religion is a godless religion.\nThere is no question of, no problem of disposing of the remains – there are none. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nBEING WITH YOU I FEEL SO BLISSFUL AND LIBERATED, AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END TO IT. YOU MUST HAVE TRICKED ME. WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?\nI am a simple man without any secret. I am just an open book, and a book in which nothing is written. If you like to call it a secret it is your choice, but it is a very open secret.\nIf you want to be, learn the art of being:\nnot to be.\nLet me repeat it, because I know you are deaf. If you want really to be, the only way is to learn not to be. Disappear. Just as God disappears from existence, you have to disappear from your life. Let life flow of its own accord.\nIt is the simplest art in the world, to be silent. It is not a doing, it is a non-doing. How can it be difficult?\nI am showing you the way of enlightenment through laziness. Nothing has to be done to attain it, because it is your nature. You have already got it. You are just so busy with outer business that you cannot see your own nature.\nDeep within you is exactly the same as outside you: the beauty, the silence, the ecstasy, the blissfulness. But please, sometimes be kind to yourself: just sit down and don’t do anything, either physically or mentally. Relax, not in an American way... because I have seen so many American books titled HOW TO RELAX. The very title says that the man knows nothing about relaxation. There is no “how.”\nYes, it is okay – “How to Repair a Car”; you will have to do something. But there is no doing as such as far as relaxation is concerned. Just don’t do anything. I know you will find it a little difficult in the beginning. That is not because relaxation is difficult, it is because you have become addicted to doing something. That addiction will take a little time to disappear.\nJust be, and watch. Being is not doing, and watching is also not doing. You sit silently doing nothing, witnessing whatsoever is happening. Thoughts will be moving in your mind; your body may be feeling some tension somewhere, you may have a migraine. Just be a witness. Don’t be identified with it. Watch, be a watcher on the hills, and everything else is happening in the valley. It is a knack, not an art.\nMeditation is not a science. It is not an art, it is a knack – just that way. All that you need is a little patience.\nThe old habits will continue; the thoughts will go on rushing. And your mind is always in a rush hour, the traffic is always jammed. Your body is not accustomed to sitting silently – you will be tossing and turning. Nothing to be worried about. Just watch that the body is tossing and turning, that the mind is whirling, is full of thoughts – consistent, inconsistent, useless – fantasies, dreams. You remain in the center, just watching.\nAll the religions of the world have taught people to do something: stop the process of thought, force the body into a still posture. That’s what yoga is – a long practice of forcing the body to be still. But a forced body is not still. And all the prayers, concentrations, contemplations of all the religions do the same with the mind: they force it, they don’t allow the thoughts to move. Yes, you have the capacity to do it. And if you persist you may be able to stop the thought process. But this is not the real thing, it is absolutely fake.\nWhen stillness comes on its own, when silence descends without your effort, when you watch thoughts and a moment comes when thoughts start disappearing and silence starts happening, that is beautiful. The thoughts stop of their own accord if you don’t identify, if you remain a witness and you don’t say, “This is my thought.”\nYou don’t say, “This is bad, this is good,” “This should be there.…” and “This should not be there”\nThen you are not a watcher; you have prejudices, you have certain attitudes. A watcher has no prejudice, he has no judgment. He simply sees like a mirror.\nWhen you bring something in front of a mirror it reflects, simply reflects. There is no judgment that the man is ugly, that the man is beautiful, that, “Aha! What a good nose you have got.” The mirror has nothing to say. Its nature is to mirror; it mirrors. This is what I call meditation: you simply mirror everything within or without.\nAnd I guarantee you I can guarantee because it has happened to me and to many of my people;\njust watching patiently – maybe a few days will pass, maybe a few months, maybe a few years. There is no way of saying because each individual has a different collection.\nYou must have seen people collecting antiques, postal stamps. Everybody has a different collection; the quantity may be different, hence the time it takes will be different – but go on remaining a witness as much as you can. And this meditation needs no special time. You can wash the floor and remain silently watching yourself washing the floor.\nI can move my hand unconsciously, without watching, or I can move it with full awareness. And there is a qualitative difference. When you move it unconsciously it is mechanical. When you move it with consciousness there is grace. Even in the hand, which is part of your body, you will feel silence, coolness – what to say about the mind?\nWith your watching and watching, slowly the rush of thoughts starts getting less and less. Moments of silence start appearing; a thought comes, and then there is silence before another thought appears. These gaps will give you the first glimpse of meditation and the first joy that you are arriving home.\nSoon the gaps will be bigger, and finally the gap is always with you. You may be doing something, the silence is there. You may not be doing anything, the silence is there. Even in sleep the silence is there.\nFor a meditator there are no dreams; dreams and thoughts are cousin-brothers, there is not much difference. If thoughts disappear, dreams disappear. And if for twenty-four hours a day you are surrounded by silence you will come to know what my secret is.\nIf you go near a lake, you start feeling cool. There is no secret in it – it is the milieu. You go to the forest and you feel the difference in the atmosphere. You are the same but the atmosphere around you is different.\nWhen you come closer to me... and to come closer to me you are not to walk and sit by my side. To come closer to me is to be not a Christian, not a Hindu, not a Mohammedan, not a Buddhist, not a communist. To come close to me means that you don’t cling to any ideology, you don’t go on holding onto the past. To come close to me means you start living moment to moment.\nNeither the past means anything to you, nor are you worried about the future. This very moment becomes the only reality. In fact it is the only reality. And if you can be in this moment, you can be on a faraway star but you will be close to me and you will feel a serenity, a silence, a lovingness such as you have never known.\nI am not doing anything, remember, so don’t be grateful to me. I am a non-doer – I am just being available. That is not much of a doing. I am available, like the trees in the forest and the lakes and the ocean, and the sun and the moon. I am available. Now it is up to you to come close to me, or go away from me.\nIf you can come close to me you will start feeling things that have been unknown to you, and soon you will realize that what you are feeling close to me you can feel yourself wherever you are. That is the greatest moment of happiness for a master, when his disciple can be on his own.\nYou must know the meaning of being a disciple, people have forgotten; it comes from “discipline.”\nAnd all the religions have corrupted the meaning of discipline; its root meaning is learning. Coming close is learning.\nWhat I have got, you have got.\nI am aware of it, you are not aware of it.\nComing close to me you will learn, “My God! This has always been with me, and I have been searching all over the world, looking into the books, scriptures, seeking the teachers, becoming a member of rotten cults like Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism – all dead.”\nYes, when Buddha was there what is happening to you was happening to his people. But when Buddha is gone what is left behind is mere words, containers; the content is not there. You can go on decorating the containers, but that will not help. You know perfectly well that your statues in the temples, your scriptures in the churches, are just dust of the past. It is better to be finished with them.\nBut why are you seeking? You are seeking because you are not aware that you have got it already. I cannot give it to you. I can only make you aware, and for that nothing is needed but availability on my part, availability on your part. If these two availabilities are there, two opennesses, without any conditions, it clicks. Suddenly you become a mirror, and the moment you become a mirror you become a master. The same will start happening around you.\nSo I don’t want you always to remain disciples. That will be a shame.\nIn the past all the religions have tried just the opposite of what I am doing. That’s why they cannot believe that this is a religion. I am changing the very definition and the foundations. Those old religions were saying that Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of God, you are not. He is special, you are ordinary. He comes with a message from God, from above. He has a speciality, he is extra-ordinary.\nAt the most you can be Christians, but you cannot be a Christ. Have you thought about it, that in two thousand years nobody has been a Christ again? What kind of religion is this? Just Christians! The first and the last Christ was crucified two thousand years ago; since then nothing has happened, because unless you become a Christ your Christianity is just a hypocrisy. The same is true about other religions.\nOnce it happened in Baghdad – Caliph Omar was the sovereign. A man was brought to him who was claiming that he had been sent by God and that he brought the latest word of God, the latest message, because Mohammed’s message was thirteen hundred years old, and in thirteen hundred years a new message – better, more polished, more sophisticated – was needed. He had been sent by God.\nNow, Mohammedans cannot accept anybody as a prophet after Mohammed. No religion accepts anybody else as a prophet. Christians cannot accept anybody as a Christ. Buddhists cannot accept another as a Buddha. Why? Why this similarity? There is some arithmetic behind it. A new prophet will disturb the gullible, the old believers, because he will say something new. He may say something against the KORAN, THE BIBLE, the GITA; he is bound to.\nI cannot agree with Krishna, the GITA that he had spoken five thousand years ago. Five thousand years have not gone just as a waste; man’s consciousness has risen, intelligence has become more solid. And what Krishna teaches is violence. If Krishna is right, then the third world war is perfectly okay.\nI cannot give that okay to the third world war. Krishna says, “It is God’s will. If he wants the war, all your pacifists can go on parading in the capitals of the world with posters against war – it will not change anything. If God wants the war then the war is going to happen.” That is the message of the GITA. Arjuna, Krishna’s chief disciple and friend, tried hard to argue.\nBut those arguments are all ordinary. If I had been in his place, just a single sentence from me would have been enough – there would have been no need to make such a big book. I would have said to Krishna, “This is God’s will, that I am going to the Himalayas. Who are you to interpret God’s will? And how can I accept it, that your interpretation is right? You say that God wants the war – I say no.”\nAnd in fact the no seems to be more rational, more loving, more meaningful, more humane. Rather than arguing with that man, Arjuna had just to say: “I have accepted your idea that whatsoever happens, happens according to God” – and then should have left for the Himalayas.\nHe wanted to be a sannyasin, a meditator in the Himalayas. Krishna would not have been able to stop him – just because of his own argument. Arjuna could have said, “If war is to happen, God will bring me back – but you keep quiet.”\nHence Hindus would not like anybody else to be accepted as a prophet of God.\nMohammed talks nonsense. You cannot expect anything better from an uneducated man who could not write, who could not read, who had never been in any way a meditative man.\nHe married nine women. Now, I cannot support that, because in the world men and women are almost in equal proportions. If one man marries nine women then what about the eight men who will be left without women? Then California will be all over the world. That catastrophe I cannot allow. I would rather that California went down into the ocean with all its homosexuals, with all its perverts. It would be better, far more beneficial, and a blessing to humanity.\nBut Mohammed marries nine women – of course; he is a messenger of God. Mohammedans he allows to marry four women – naturally; he has to keep himself higher. Mohammedans are still marrying four women. Anyone with any intelligence can see the point: these are the people who create prostitution. They have created prostitutes, because what about the three men whose women they have married?\nAnd can you understand a simple, biological thing? You cannot even satisfy a single woman sexually, what about four or nine? – because recent research shows that a woman is capable of multiple orgasms. A man is not capable of that. If he is young, below thirty-five, he may be able to have one orgasm. And I am saying maybe. It is not certain, because man is in such a hurry that before the orgasm can happen he is finished.\nOrgasm needs a certain patience, to move with the woman, with the same pace. The woman moves slowly. By the time she comes close to her orgasm, the man has gone to sleep and is snoring. Eighty percent of women in the world have not known what orgasm is. And in a country like India, ninety-nine percent of women know nothing about orgasm.\nBiologically, a man cannot satisfy four women. Then those women are going to look around the neighborhood. These religions have created all kinds of perversions: prostitution, obscenity. And if these men cannot find women, at least they can look at PLAYBOY – just pictures of naked women! One feels the world has lived in an insane way. Will your hunger be satisfied by seeing beautiful dishes in a picture? Can you eat them? But that is what is happening to man’s sexuality.\nHe looks into magazines – vulgar, obscene – of naked women. For what? – when there are equal numbers of women available, living, alive, not just photographs.\nFour women to one man! But this is nothing, four or nine; Krishna had sixteen thousand women to himself! I sometimes start wondering... sixteen thousand women. Even to remember their names is difficult.\nI know, because I have more than half a million sannyasins around the world; I cannot remember their names. And Krishna lived only ninety years. In ninety years how did he manage to make love to sixteen thousand women? Perhaps to one woman once in her life... and then she was abandoned. This is ugly.\nThat’s why new prophets are not allowed by any religion – because they will look, scrutinize, see that these things are ugly.\nIn Baghdad this man declared, “I am the prophet of God, the latest, and I bring a more sophisticated message than Mohammed.” Mohammedans could not tolerate it. Omar himself was a very cultured man.… Now you may be cultured, but your Mohammedanism is there; it goes on poisoning you. Omar sent the man to the prison, told the guards, “Don’t give him food. Bind him to a pole, beat him continuously, and don’t let him sleep. After seven days I will come to ask what he thinks.”\nAfter seven days he came. The man was almost dying, without food, without sleep, continuously beaten for twenty-four hours a day. Omar laughed and said, “Now have you changed your mind, or do you still think you are the last messenger of God?”\nThe man laughed more loudly than Omar and said, “This torture for seven days proves that I am the prophet of God, because when I was leaving him to take my voyage to the earth, I asked him, ‘They have not behaved well with prophets in the past – what is going to happen to me?’ He said, ‘You will be tortured.’ You have proved that I am really the prophet of God. Before this torture sometimes I used to doubt, to think that perhaps I am imagining, but now there is no question of doubt.”\nAt that very moment, from another pole, another naked man who had been there for one month continuously being tortured, shouted, “Omar, don’t listen to that idiot! I have not sent him. After Mohammed I have not sent anybody else.” One month before this man had been caught declaring himself God!\nThese religions are just dead history. They cannot give you anything. Only a living master is capable of creating an atmosphere I call the buddhafield, the field for awakening.\nAnd I have chosen Oregon because I could not find so many sleepy people anywhere else in the world; otherwise, who has heard of any prophet in Oregon? I thought, “Even a small place like Judea can claim Jesus, Jerusalem can claim Moses, small places like Mecca and Medina can claim Mohammed. Oregon is absolutely impotent.” I thought it would be good; hence I am here.\nBut to wake up a sleepy man is always a difficult job. The sleepy man does not want to wake up. Sleep helps him to forget all the worries of life, the troubles of life. Sleep is a narcotic. It is a drug naturally provided by biology; otherwise you would all go mad. Six, eight hours of sleep help you to keep on dragging your life towards the grave.\nNaturally Oregonians are disturbed: we are celebrating here. And what are they doing? They are collecting National Guard vehicles in Madras – as if this is an army and we are going to attack and start the third world war. We believe in love, we believe in silence. We believe that man can live in coexistence with nature, with other people.\nThis is the only city which has no crime, but it has been declared by the attorney general of Oregon to be illegal. This is how sleepy people behave. In their sleep the only legal city looks illegal to them! We have no crime, no prostitutes, no stealing, no drugs. this is our fault. For us to be peaceful, to be silent, just to be happy, they cannot tolerate. They cannot believe it, because it has never happened in their life – poor people! I really feel sorry for them.\nThis place is creating a New Man.\nBut naturally the old mind will create every difficulty, will use every means so that the New Man is not born. Why? – it hurts. Seeing a man dancing, singing, enjoying, peaceful with himself and existence hurts those people who have become accustomed to living in misery, who have become accustomed to living a life which is not living at all. They cannot tolerate you.\nI have heard about a woman who was ugly, really ugly. She used to break mirrors; wherever she found a mirror she would break it immediately.\nPeople asked, “Are you mad? Why do you break mirrors?” She said, “These mirrors make me ugly.”\nNow you will be becoming mirrors amongst sleepy people. You will disturb their sleep. They are going to destroy you. And remember, you are very few – they are many.\nBut one thing is positively in your favor: you have something – you have a contentment. They are empty. Just kick the empty boxes as hard as you can! Perhaps they may wake up and thank you for it.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY ARE ONLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ABLE TO REALIZE TRUE RELIGION? DOES THE MEDIOCRE MIND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO KNOW ONESELF?\nReligion is the highest luxury in the world. The idiot cannot realize it while remaining an idiot. The mediocre cannot even conceive its possibility while remaining mediocre. Only the highest intelligence can reach to that point where religion flowers.\nReligion needs courage, intelligence, daring, because you are going higher and higher in the world of consciousness. The mediocre has no idea that there is anything higher than himself. The only possibility for the mediocre is that he can drop his mediocrity.\nNobody is born mediocre. People are made mediocre by the politicians, by the priests, by the education system. You think you go to the school to be made more intelligent – you are wrong. You go to the college, you to go the university, you have a masters degree, you can have a Ph.D., you can become a D.Litt. A D.Litt means that now the society has recognized that the doors for the evolution of your consciousness are completely closed. Now for you there is no way.\nThe whole educational system is arranged in such a way that it teaches you, trains you for memory, not for intelligence – and these two things are totally different. A very intelligent man may not have a very good memory. In fact to have a good memory means you are mediocre. A good memory simply proves you are only a computer, not even a man, so what has been fed into you you can repeat.\nYou can see it very easily: the people who top the universities, come first in the class, receive golden medals – where do they all disappear in the world? Their gold medals don’t shine in the world. In\nthe world you will not be able to recognize them. Educational systems train you for a good memory, so you can repeat absolutely useless things.\nWhen was Genghis Khan born? Now what purpose does that serve? If he had not been born it would have been better. At least we can do one thing, we can remove him from our memory; he was a nightmare. When did the second world war begin? This is history, you have to memorize it. And when you memorize history – Genghis Khan, Nadir Shah, Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and other idiots who may be in the history, or who are right now making history, who soon will be part of the history.…\nIt is better to forget these people. It would have been better if there had been no second world war. That is the only way to prevent the third world war. Forget all this nonsense that man has been doing to man.\nBut the whole educational system is to make you memorize. And man’s mind is capable of memorizing without any limit. It has been found that that is possible because in a man’s small skull there are millions of cells which memorize. It is just like tape recording. All the books in all the libraries of the world can be memorized by a single person – that much capacity your memory has. But then you get lost in your memory, you forget what intelligence is. Intelligence is totally different.\nIntelligence is the capacity to be silent, to be awake, to be able to see the truth.\nBut nobody is interested in truth; in fact they are all against it, because what will happen to all these politicians around the world who are constantly lying? If truth is known they will go down the drain. You are fed with lies and you are distracted from intelligence towards memory. Memory is part of your brain, and you live your whole life in your brain. That’s why I say only intelligent people can be religious.\nJust by being a Christian, going every Sunday to the church, listening to the same boring sermon.… And there is never any argument, because argument brings intelligence in.\nEvery religion expects you to believe; the unbeliever is condemned. And without doubt you cannot increase your intelligence. This is the trouble. All the religions are helping you to remain mediocre, stupid, by emphasizing belief: belief in God, belief in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ Believe,\nbecause those who believe will attain to paradise. All the religions are giving you good awards – just believe.\nJust the other day I came to know that in New York the anti-abortionists were having a conference: abortion should be no longer legal, it should become a crime. All the religions of the world agree on such points. It is very strange: they don’t agree on any theological points, but on this point Hindus agree, Mohammedans agree, Christians agree, Jews agree, everybody agrees – abortion is a sin.\nMother Teresa was in the conference, speaking against abortion, and she said, “There is violence in\nthe world because of abortion.”\nI could not believe it. If someone had said, “The violence in the world is because of overpopulation,”\nthat would have sounded more true. But this old woman is given a Nobel prize – for what? Everything\nshe does is against humanity. What arguments did she place before the conference? Why does abortion create violence in the world? Because abortion means you are killing a living body, you are making people killers of their own children, that opens the door to violence. The argument looks good, but it only looks good.\nAt what point is the child alive? If abortion creates violence, then at what point is the child alive? At the time when the male and female living cells meet – is that the point of life? It has to be, because otherwise from where will life come? But if it is life, that means that when the living cells were male and female, when the female eggs were in a woman’s body and the male cells were in a man’s body – were they alive or not?\nCelibacy kills more than anything else, because if a nun, a celibate nun, who is not going to produce a\nchild at allthen all those living cells that she brings from her mother’s wombIn a woman’s body\ncells don’t grow, she brings them from birth. All those eggs waiting to be alive, waiting to be Ronald Reagan – they die without any chance.\nAnd do you know a man, a single man, produces in his whole life, from age fourteen up to fifty, so\nmany living cells that that single man can populate the whole world. What to say about a celibate monk? Every single monk is killing millions of people!\nFrom where does the violence begin? If anybody is responsible then it is Mother Teresa, the pope, their God. Why does he go on and on producing eggs and living sperms? It is time to stop. Already the world is four times more populated than it should be. If the world population can be reduced to one-fourth there will be no poverty, no violence; thousands of problems will disappear.\nBut Mother Teresa is given a Nobel prize because she helps orphans, opens orphanages around the world. She is creating problems; these orphans will create children. And she is against abortion, because if abortion is legal from where is she going to get the orphans? And what about the Nobel prize? This senile woman is driving people crazy.\nAbsolute birth control is needed at least for two decades. Absolute, I say! Not that you have to stop after two children or three children – no, that will not help.\nHalf the world is dying of starvation, and you will be surprised to know that the poor countries, the starving countries, produce more children, for the simple reason that they don’t have any other means of passing their time. To go to the movies, money is needed; to go to a disco, money is needed. Sex is the only free entertainment.\nAbsolute birth control is needed.\nThis is the only city where no child has been born in four years.\nUnless we cut the world population there is no way to avoid violence. People are hungry, people are starving, dying. When somebody is hungry he is going to steal. When somebody is dying, what does he care if he kills somebody else and gets money to survive? – because lust for life is the basis of all biological growth. A man can do anything to survive.\nAnd secondly, if abortion becomes illegal... the pope would like to make all birth control methods illegal. If abortion is illegal, if birth control methods are illegal, can you think what will happen to this world? Everybody will be at everybody else’s neck just to survive.\nAnd it has to be remembered that birth control and abortion have given women equality, the same status as men; otherwise the woman can never be equal to man. In poor countries she is continually giving birth, a child every year. She is always pregnant. She cannot work, she cannot be financially independent. She cannot get as educated as man, she cannot be in politics; she has to take care of the children.\nBirth control methods, abortion – these have made possibilities for women to be equal to men; otherwise all talk about equality is bogus, false, pseudo.\nBut strange... Mother Teresa is a woman, and she has there two or three dozen nuns – who are all women. She has an order of nuns, and they don’t even see that not a single woman has been accepted as pope in these two thousand years. Not a single woman has been accepted as a Christ, a buddha, a prophet – no. If a woman manages somehow to get into religious matters she is called a witch.\nThe word is not bad, but Christians have given it a bad connotation. Literally the word “witch” means a wise woman. But when you call a woman a witch you do not mean that she is wise. These popes have been declaring women witches – not only declaring, they have been burning women alive, thousands of women. During the whole Middle Ages they were burning witches.\nWho were these witches? What were they doing? They were interfering in religious matters, and man would not like any woman to enter into the hierarchy of religion; otherwise, she may become a prophet, she may become a pope, she may declare herself a Christ.\nIn Hinduism women are not allowed to read the scriptures. In fact there is no time for them – taking care of the house, taking care of the children... and they are continuously pregnant. This is what Mother Teresa wants. This is what your popes, your bishops want. They will create a mediocre world. They want a mediocre world, just on the survival level.\nRemember one simple scientific truth, that if a plant does not get enough water, enough food, enough air, then the first thing to disappear will be the flowers. They are the most delicate. The higher a thing is, the more delicate it is, the more fragile it is. Then the leaves will start disappearing, then the branches will start disappearing. At the end there will be only roots, underground.\nThe same is the situation in every dimension: if you don’t allow man comfort, luxury, time, he will\nnever reach to higher peaks. He is, on the contrary, prevented from reaching towards religion.\nThe first thing religions say is: Believe. That is against true religion. I say to you, doubt everything, unless you discover something which you cannot doubt. I don’t say to believe. I say, find out something which, even if you want to, you cannot doubt: it is there, a reality, a truth.\nGo on doubting. Doubt is the method of a true religion – just as it is a method of a true science. By doubting you eliminate all that is wrong, and finally only that which is true remains in your hand. Try\nto doubt it too. But you cannot – it is there. And when truth is known – lived, not believed – only then do you understand what religion is.\nAll these religions are anti-religious. The religions that exist in the world are anti-religious. My effort is to create the first religion in the world. All these people have been preventing religion from happening; hence, they are all against me.\nYou will be surprised... it has never happened before – all religions are against me. They have never been against anybody all together; on this point they are in agreement. And, even more surprising, atheists are against me. They too agree with the theists on this point. Communists are against me. They don’t believe in God, they don’t believe in the soul, they don’t believe in meditation, but they are also in agreement with people who believe in God, who believe in the soul, who believe in all kinds of things. On only one point, one single point, are they all agreed.\nThis has never happened; it is happening now for the simple reason that I am clearly giving you the indication.\nMy fingers are pointing towards the truth.\nBelief is not needed, scriptures are not needed, prophets are not needed, God is not needed. A tremendous courage to doubt everything is needed. It is your doubting capacity which will sharpen your intelligence, destroy your mediocrity. But remember, with your mediocrity many other things will be destroyed which depend on mediocrity. So beware, I am a dangerous man.\nIf you want to be intelligent you cannot be in politics. Politics needs idiots, people who can lie, people who can go on lying, people who have double faces, people who can change their personality any moment. They don’t have any individuality. If you want to be intelligent you cannot be in any politics.\nIf you want to be really religious you cannot be a member of any religious cult. You have to be free. You have to be individual, you have to be on your own. It will be fearful in the beginning because you have always lived in the crowd. The crowd gives you a certain coziness, warmth. You will be in the cold, alone.\nIf you are ready to be alone and in the cold, and ready to go in darkness in search of light, religion is yours.\nCHAPTER 4\nJust drop the cross!\n1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nRAJNEESHISM IS PURELY A RELIGION OF CELEBRATION, SO WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AGAINST IT?\nThat’s why! All the religions of the world have been religions of sado-masochism. They have created a miserable world. Their whole strategy is to make you convinced that this life is a life of sin. You have been made to feel guilty for just being alive.\nThe biblical story will help you to understand. Adam and Eve are expelled from paradise because of a simple enquiry. And the enquiry was also initiated by the so-called God – or Godot. He told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit of two trees: one, the tree of knowledge; the other, the tree of eternal life. One can see what kind of God this must have been.\nTo deprive man of wisdom, to prohibit him from tasting the beauties of eternal life, is simply ugly, inhuman – I will not call it even devilish, but it is really the devil that you have been told is God. If He were really a creator of the universe and consciousness, He would have been the first person to tell Adam and Eve to taste wisdom and to taste eternal life. He was not religious at all. You cannot find a more irreligious person than the Christian God.\nReligion is nothing but a science to attain wisdom, understanding, to know what life is, and to live it in utter celebration.\nAnd you can live life in celebration only if you know there is no death. If you know that it is going to be eternal, that there is no beginning and no end, only then can you live without misery. God prohibited man from both. Without wisdom you cannot attain to religious ecstasy, and without the feeling of eternal life you cannot sing and you cannot dance.\nWhen death is there every moment, and any moment you can be taken away.… They say, “Never ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.” You cannot be certain about the next moment. How can you enjoy, when death is so close and follows you like a shadow?\nThis idiot, God, prohibits man from only two trees. And they lived in the Garden of Eden where millions of trees must have existed. He is not even as intelligent as Sigmund Freud, who is not very intelligent either. Just average intelligence is needed to know that to prohibit anything is dangerous; it gives a challenge to the mind. It is not the serpent who convinced Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge, it is God himself.\nBy pointing out these two trees, God makes it certain that these people sooner or later will be attracted towards them. If He had not mentioned them, I don’t think even up to now we would have been able to find those two trees in the immense garden of paradise. And if it was the serpent who convinced Eve, he is the first revolutionary, the first man who feels and who knows what has to be done. He is the most intelligent being in your whole BIBLE – the serpent – because he was showing the way of understanding.\nMost of your misery is caused by your misunderstanding, your ignorance, your unintelligence. Most of the misery is caused because you are continuously afraid of death – and it is there walking by your side. If these two things can be removed, celebration will come on its own.\nIf you could be aware that there is no death, wouldn’t you love to sing like birds in the morning? Wouldn’t you love to dance like the peacocks of my garden? If you start understanding human problems, you cannot be miserable. I have not been miserable for so long that I cannot conceive how you go on maintaining misery, you go on nourishing it. You are really strange people. What are the causes of your misery?\nYou look at a beautiful woman. Naturally you are attracted, but your wife is by your side continuously watching you. She is miserable, because how can she enjoy life when she is continuously suspicious of you? You are miserable because this wretched wife is always there. You cannot even have a glimpse of a beautiful woman, you have to avoid seeing her. But a little understanding will dispel the whole thing.\nIt is natural, anything beautiful has to be appreciated. You have to show your wife, “Look! What a beautiful woman.” And if there is understanding, the woman will understand it; there will be no jealousy, there will be no quarrel. It is human to taste different joys of life. You cannot eat the same food every day. How can you enjoy the same man or woman every day? It is asking for the impossible. Misery is bound to happen. You will become a hypocrite.\nIt is perfectly human once in a while to have a different dish. And if people are understanding... your wife will understand if once in a while you go with another woman; her love will be great enough to allow you that freedom.\nLove always allows freedom. Understanding means freedom.\nAnd if your wife goes to some man one day, just for the weekend, you will not feel offended. After the weekend you will both be enriched. You will find your wife again, your wife will find you again. Those first days of love, those days of honeymoon will be back. And when you see that the other gives you so much freedom and so much understanding, you respect them, you feel grateful.\nBut all the religions have been prohibiting you from everything natural; obviously, they have made you miserable.\nYour whole education system tries to create ambition in you – not understanding. Your education pushes you to become the governor, the premier, the president, whatsoever the cost. The politician cannot be happy – in spite of Jimmy Carter’s phony smile. Have you seen him smiling after he was no longer president? When he was president I think he did nothing other than show his teeth to the whole world. I have heard that his wife used to close his mouth every night.\nAll lies – everything phony and American... all plastic. You know the phrase, “the white lie.” Perhaps that’s why you call your president’s house the White House. It is a very suitable name, because only white lies exist there.\nMan is living unnaturally. If he lives naturally then he feels guilty, because his religion, his education, his culture go on and on conditioning him: “You have to go above nature.” Who can go above nature? Nature is all! – there is nothing above it. You have to be natural.\nThat’s what my basic teaching is: be natural. Don’t try to go beyond nature. That is the beginning of misery, pain. And when you are miserable, when you are in pain, you cannot tolerate anybody who is celebrating. It hurts, it humiliates you.\nMy people are humiliating all the religions of the world. Naturally they are against me and against you. It is your celebration that is creating the trouble. Have long, British faces. Tears are accepted, not smiles.\nHave you seen Jesus Christ, in any picture, smiling? And Christianity has chosen as its symbol, the cross. Now, the people who are carrying the cross, can they celebrate? A cross is hanging on your neck – it may be a golden cross, but a cross is a cross. All Christians worshipping the cross are managing to remain miserable. They don’t love Jesus Christ, they love his being crucified. Remember, Christianity was not born out of Jesus Christ’s sayings – there is nothing much in them. You cannot make a religion out of them. The whole of Jesus Christ’s doctrine can be condensed on a postcard.\nChristianity was not born out of Jesus’ teachings, it was born out of his crucifixion. Why was the cross accepted so easily? – and Christianity is now the biggest religion in the world. It suited man. It helped man in a very dangerous way. It made you aware that your misery is nothing compared to the misery of Jesus Christ. You are carrying a very small cross around your neck; Jesus had to carry a very heavy cross on his shoulders. Three times he fell on the road because of the weight of the cross. He was whipped and told to take up the cross again.\nThe crucified Jesus is your religion. Compared to your misery, his misery is immense. Naturally, Christianity became the biggest religion in the world, because it is the biggest philosophy of being miserable.\nJesus said, “Carry you cross on your shoulders. Everybody has to carry his cross on his shoulders.” I don’t see any point in it. Why carry a cross on your shoulder? Are you mad? Rather, carry a flute with you, a song, a beautiful flower – a rose I can understand. But then you will be hated by all those who have missed the joys of life. But nobody else is responsible for their missing, they themselves are responsible.\nJesus says, “Blessed are the poor.” This is sheer nonsense. Wretched are the poor. But it gives solace to the millions of poor people of the world. Jesus says that those who are poor here will be able to inherit the kingdom of God. I do not understand the arithmetic. If they are going to inherit the kingdom of God, why should they be poor here? Why can’t they inherit it here, now?\nI say to you: the kingdom of God is yours herenow, this very moment. Just drop the cross. My religion is very simple: drop the cross. You have carried it long enough, for thousands of lives; it has almost become part of you.\nSo when you see someone dancing and you are crippled – crippled because of your cross, you are dying under its burden, and somebody is playing on his flute – you cannot forgive this man. He makes you aware that you have missed the train, that you are a fool. Nobody wants to accept himself as a fool – except a wise man.\nThe moment you accept that you are behaving foolishly, the change starts beginning. It is your responsibility. I have never seen any miserable man for whom anybody else was responsible. It is your conditioning.\nJesus says, “The camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man.” The animals, the camels, are going to inherit the kingdom of God, remember; they will pass through the needle. But a rich man cannot pass through the gates of God. They have taught you to remain poor, they have given you all incentives to remain poor.\nMy religion is a religion of richness.\nWhy wait for tomorrow? Why wait for a lifetime, in which you cannot be certain of inheriting the kingdom of God after death, and for that, suffer your whole life here? I say to you, forget God and forget the kingdom of God. I give you here and now! Just be ready to drop your conditionings. You are not handicapped, you are not crippled. Every child is born a joy, a celebration, a dance, a song; but somewhere he loses it all. That’s why all the poets of all the languages go on remembering how beautiful it was to be a child.\nWhat was beautiful in being a child? I cannot say that, because I have been becoming more and more blissful; childhood was just the beginning. If an old man says that his childhood was paradise, that means his whole life has been a hell. He has not been growing up, he is going down. Just to grow old is not growing up.\nGrowing up is a totally different phenomenon. It means the last moment on the earth for you will be the most precious moment. The departure from this life will be the climax of your joy. Childhood is only a beginning.\nBut the religions start distorting the children from the beginning. They create guilt in them, they create unnatural ideals in them. They create their conscience in such a way that they cannot live happily ever. On every point they are at a crossroad, and they will choose the road that suits their conditioning.\nChristians say you have been punished because Adam and Eve disobeyed God. It is impossible for me to conceive that Adam and Eve’s disobedience is still keeping you miserable. And what had they done? It was sheer curiosity. And they did well. Instead of worshipping God and Jesus Christ in your churches, worship the serpent. Adam and Eve, they are the right people; they disobeyed. It was needed; otherwise there would have been no humanity. There would have been no Albert Einstein, no Bertrand Russell, no Gautam Buddha. There was no possibility. You would have been still animals, naked in the Garden of Eden.\nAnd God immediately drove them out of the garden. I sometimes wonder what model of car he used to drive them out. It must have been a Ford, because “blessed are the poor.” And strange: four-wheelers, Fords, are going in and out of God’s garden, his gate, but a rich man cannot enter. Ford himself cannot enter.\nIf you teach people to be poor, and you bribe them to remain poor.… And the bribe is bogus – it is\nafter death that you will have all the pleasure of lifeBut if in God’s garden all the pleasures of life\nare available, one thing is certain, that pleasures are not condemned.\nIf you look at the Mohammedan concept of paradise – your word “paradise” comes from a Mohammedan word, firdaus – all kinds of pleasures are available. Beautiful women stuck at the age of sixteen for eternity, they don’t grow up; rivers of wine – bottles are not enough Drink, swim,\nhave a deep plunge into the wine; enjoy it as much as you can – and all free. This is the arrangement for the religious people.\nBut I cannot see how the contradiction can be resolved. Here wine is a sin. Here, to have many beautiful women is a sin, and there it becomes a virtue. Virtues are rewarded by sins – strange logic! But it was needed to keep the poor, poor.\nIn India I have never seen a single rich man converting to Christianity. I have seen only poor, starving, orphans being converted to Christianity. Christianity thrives on poverty, because only the poor need the consolation. Only the poor need motivation to drag their life up to the grave – beyond the grave everything is just as it should be.\nWhen I say celebrate – because this life is a gift of existence to you You have not asked for it, you\nhave not paid for it. You, in fact, don’t deserve it. Still, existence is overflowing towards you, sharing all its joys. But you turn out to be such an idiot that when the sun is rising and the sky is full of colors – a time to dance, to sing – you are sitting in a dark church, gloomy, before a cross.\nMy people worship, but not in a church.\nThey worship the beauty of existence.\nA bird flying, a cloud wandering in the sky, the moon, the stars... Outside you can see the whole existence is in celebration, but you have closed your eyes to it. With closed eyes you are saying, “Ave Maria, Ave Maria,” and you go on saying it.\nYes, all the religions are against me because I teach celebration, because I teach joy, because I teach comfort, I teach luxury, I teach richness.\nAnd man has the intelligence to make the whole world so luxurious that even if there are saints in heaven, they will start praying to go back to the earth. I cannot see that the saints in heaven can enjoy beautiful women, because they missed here, and this is a rehearsal, just a training period of seventy years. If for seventy years you have been repressing yourself, just by entering into heaven, what will you do with your repression? What will you do with your guilt?\nTHE BIBLE was written two thousand years ago; otherwise, marijuana, LSD, hashish – everything would have been made available to the saints in paradise. Of course, here it is a crime and would have remained a crime, but for saints you have to be lenient: they have suffered so much; you have to compensate.\nI don’t tell you about tomorrow, I tell you only of this moment. And if you can enjoy this moment, the next moment you will be more capable of enjoying. If tomorrow ever comes, you will be ready to dance, to love.\nThese religions are bound to be against me, because they are not religions. I want it to be emphasized that this is the only religion. All those religions of the past were sick, pathological. If you start thinking about them, you can easily see that they were pathological. They have made the whole world sick, and they are still going on doing it. They call it “service to humanity.”\nMother Teresa wrote a letter to me. Because I criticized her a few years ago, she wrote a letter to me: “I cannot understand your criticism. Service to humanity is the true religion. Don’t you agree with it?” I wrote to her, “Yes, I agree. Tell all six hundred million Catholics to commit suicide. That will be a service to humanity.”\nThe world is suffering from overpopulation – Christians should start committing suicide and serve humanity. But they go on doing just the opposite; they go on opening hospitals, they go on saving orphans. They are against birth control, they are against abortion. This is service to humanity? Nothing can be more poisonous to humanity than what Mother Teresa is doing.\nIn her letter she asked me, “Are you infallible? I believe in the infallible Jesus Christ.”\nI am not such a fool as to be infallible. I am an ordinary man just like you. I am very much fallible. One of my Indian sannyasins is here – his name is Falibhai. Whenever I see him I think to change his name to “Fallible-bhai.”\nJesus is claiming that he is infallible – and he cannot see that Judas is going to betray him. He cannot see that going to Jerusalem during that religious festival is going to death. Only on the cross does he wake up; and he shouts at God, “Have you forsaken me?” But the skies remain silent.\nSilence is so beautiful. It is good that the sky does not answer your prayers; otherwise there would be so much noise around the world. And it would be difficult – what answer is given to whom? The sky remained silent.\nJesus asks for water because he is thirsty, it is a hot day. And you call this man infallible? He should just have carried a thermos. If he can carry the cross, why can’t he carry a small thermos? When you go for a holiday – and he’s going forever – a thermos is exactly the right thing to take.\nJesus is infallible, and the popes are infallible because they represent Jesus. This is a good arrangement: God is infallible, naturally his son is going to be infallible – and then you can conclude the son’s representatives are going to be infallible.\nOne of the last popes before this pope the Polack was homosexual. It was a known fact. In fact, when he became the pope his boyfriend followed him into the Vatican. He became his secretary. Secretaries are very good – girlfriend or boyfriend, it does not matter, but secretaries are very good. Do you think this homosexual is infallible? Do you think this pope the Polack is infallible?\nJust now he has been trying to convince the Jews that Christians are not anti-semitic. Why? For two thousand years they have been anti-semitic, for two thousand years they have been killing Jews. Has God changed his mind? But infallible people don’t change their mind, only fallible people change their mind.\nWhy is he trying now? His effort is to call a conference of Jewish rabbis and Christian bishops, just to meet together and settle the thing: “We are not enemies.” He has been telling bishops, “Don’t say anything against Judaism.” That can mean only one thing: that all the popes that have preceded him were fallible. Or, if they were infallible, then this Polack is fallible.\nI am not infallible. In fact, life is a continuous change. And the conscious person goes on moving and changing with life and existence. He is like a river, moving – not like a dirty pond which only goes on becoming more and more muddy; he goes nowhere, he never changes. A river goes on flowing, changing, taking new routes.\nConsciousness keeps pace with the change of life and existence.\nThere are many questions which remind me, “In 1972 you said this” Forget all about it! What I am\nsaying now is the truth – only for now, not for tomorrow. I will see tomorrow what is the truth. I am not a blind man. I see, and I see the existence continuously changing. But these bibles don’t change, these korans don’t change, these gitas don’t change – they are dead books, just rubbish. These old religions don’t change; they go on clinging to the past which exists no more.\nGalileo was called by the pope because he wrote that the earth is round, not flat. THE BIBLE says it is flat. Of course, I cannot condemn THE BIBLE; it looks flat to us too. Our vision is not that vast; we cannot see the whole earth, we see only small fragments, which look flat.\nWhen Galileo wrote that the earth is round, that it is a globe, he was forced by the pope: “You have to change it, because THE BIBLE cannot be wrong. And we cannot allow one thing to be wrong, because that will create suspicion; then other things maybe are also not right. If one thing can be wrong, then everything can be wrong. THE BIBLE has to be true word for word, as a whole.”\nGalileo must have been a man with a tremendous sense of humor. He said, “I will write whatsoever you say. If you say the world, the earth is flat, I will write it.” And he wrote it, “The earth is flat – but forgive me, this is my statement; as far as the earth is concerned it is a globe. I cannot do anything about it. I can change my statement, but what can I do with the earth? How can I make it flat to be consistent with THE BIBLE?”\n1972? Don’t even ask me about what I said yesterday. It is gone. What I am saying this moment is truth. And if tomorrow I see changes, I am not stubborn and I am not a fanatic, I will change; hence you will find thousands of contradictions in me. Anybody who is aware will have thousands of contradictions in his statements. Only a fanatic is consistent, he never contradicts himself. He keeps his eyes closed, he is afraid to see the truth.\nCelebration is the very nature of existence.\nDon’t separate yourself from existence; otherwise, you will be miserable. You cannot be nourished, you cannot eat THE BIBLE and the KORAN and the GITA. They will not nourish your body, they will kill you. If they cannot nourish even your body, how can they nourish your consciousness?\nThere is only one nourishment: your roots have to be deep down in existence. There is no other nourishment. And if you are nourished... I say, “Blessed are the nourished. Blessed are those whose roots go deep into existence. They are the richest people.” Richness does not mean only money. I am not against money; it is a perfectly good servant for exchanging things. But money alone is not richness.\nRichness is multidimensional. It happens when you are in tune with nature, in harmony with nature; it starts happening multidimensionally. You may not be aware of what will happen to you if you destroy your conditionings of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and simply rely on and trust in nature. If your consciousness also trusts nature just the way your body remains trusting towards nature.…\nYou don’t know what treasures you have got. Once there is nourishment you will start blossoming. You may not know that you can become a painter, you may not know you can become a dancer. You may be a Picasso, you may be a Nijinsky, you may be a Van Gogh, you may be a Rutherford. You don’t know who you are. You will know only when you blossom; there is no other way to know. And blossoming happens only in harmony with nature. Your roots should go not towards any church, not towards any scripture, not towards any dead prophets, but towards the nature that is available to you.\nJust be natural. Drop all sense of guilt. The guilt arises only because your conditioning says, “Don’t do this” and your nature is hungry to do it. Now you are split. Your religion, your Jesuses, your Mohammeds say, “Don’t do this, this is wrong.” Those Ten Commandments, three thousand years old – they are still dominating you. Why are you degrading yourself? Those ten Commandments say, “Don’t do this, this is sin. You will suffer in hell” – and your whole nature wants to do it.\nListen to your nature, not to your conditionings, and celebration will happen on its own accord.\nHave you seen any tree miserable? Have you seen any bird miserable? They are in harmony. Fortunately they don’t have priests, popes, shankaracharyas, imams. If the trees had popes and\nimams and shankaracharyas, then all the trees would stop flowering, would not come to fruition. They would somehow survive – only survive. Survival is not life! Survival is the minimum. You have to be overflowing, you have to be so full that you can share, and still your fullness remains full. That’s what the meaning of celebration is.\nBut the religions are bound to be against me, because if I am heard, then there is no need for any other religion in the world. They are trying to stop my words from reaching you; otherwise, there is no hope for themselves. And they have a great investment.\nIn Russia I have my sannyasins – of course, underground. But I am not a serious man; only fanatics are serious. When Russian sannyasins asked me what to do about the red clothes, the mala, I said, “Forget all about them – they don’t matter. They are just to provoke people.” But there sannyasins will be killed, so they have to meet in basements. Still the Russian government has started torturing them. They have taken their books, they have taken their tapes that they had smuggled from the outside. And they are torturing them to make them give the names of other sannyasins.\nWhy does communism fear us? – because communism is also a religion. It has its own trinity: Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, V.I. Lenin – the trinity. They also have their bible: DAS KAPITAL. Neither Christians read THE BIBLE nor do communists read DAS KAPITAL. I am the only unfortunate one who has been reading all this rubbish. Communism is an atheist religion.\nAll these people are going to stop my words from reaching people. That’s what is happening here.\nI was tremendously disappointed when I came to America. I had thought that it was a democratic country. It is not, absolutely not, because what they have been doing to my people, to me, is fascist. Democracy is just a mask; behind the democracy everything is fascist.\nYou will be surprised to know that one of my sannyasins, one of my oldest sannyasins, Ma Yoga Laxmi, who was the president of the Indian section of my sannyasins for almost ten years, and has been with me almost for twenty years.… She is frail, small-bodied... she has cancer. She has been operated on, much of her stomach has been removed. Still, in America – remember I am saying in America, not in the Soviet Union – she has been beaten by your naturalization services. She was not allowed to have her legal expert, she was not allowed to phone anybody. She was not allowed – because other sannyasins were waiting outside.\nThe officials took her first into the front part of the building. They were very sweet – just the way communists are in Russia. They tried to bribe her. They said to her, “We will give you a green card without any difficulty, we will help you in every way. And if you help us and whatsoever we say you support, we will replace Osho’s secretary and put you in power.”\nWhen she refused, when she said, “Whatsoever you are saying is absolute lies, and I am not power- hungry,” when they found that she could not be seduced in a friendly way, they forced her – four strong people for a tiny person, fragile, the body is dying – and they took her to the back. She told them, “Please, let me have my advocate with me.” They did not allow it. And at the back of the building they started beating her – of course in such a way that no medical evidence can be found. And she is so weak.…\nYou call this democracy?\nMy sannyasins – the president of the international sannyas movement, the president of this commune, the head of another corporation – all these three women, and I don’t know about others, whenever they come into the country or go out of the country officials take them into a dirty room, force them to be naked, and force their fingers into their vaginas under the pretext that they are searching for drugs. This you call democracy?\nAnd doing it to three women Perhaps they have done it to many. Those poor women cannot say\nanything, just out of shame: what to say to anybody? And there is no witness; those officials will deny it flatly. These women are tortured in an ugly, inhuman way – and this is a democratic country. Sometimes I think the attorney general of Oregon must be the reincarnation of Pontius Pilate.\nThis is also humiliation of womankind. Not only should sannyasins fight it, all the women of America should fight it. This is simply against every woman; it is not a question only of my sannyasins. But other women will remain silent because they are Christians, they are Protestants, they are Catholics, they are Jews. People cannot see because they have so many curtains before their eyes.\nYes, religions are against me – it is natural. I am also against all of them. And remember, if Jesus could work with only twelve disciples and managed to have the biggest religion in the world, what about me?\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM HAPPY THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING AGAIN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I’M SAD TOO. CAN\nYOU SAY WHY?\nIt is very simple. You are happy because I am speaking. You cannot understand my silence. To understand silence you have to be silent, and you are not. Hence you are happy that I am speaking again; you can understand words.\nThe problem for you is that you are sad also. That is a little bit complicated. You are sad because I may disturb you. I am a very unreliable person. In these thirty years it has happened many times; thousands of people have come to me, remained with me, and at a certain point dropped out. If I were silent they would have been still with me. I said something which they had never expected.\nWhen I was speaking on Jesus, many Christians became sannyasins. Now when I am speaking on Jesus, only those who have guts will remain with me; otherwise they will betray me. That’s why you are sad. Knowing my past, you know I don’t give you, like Christians do, any catechism which remains fixed. I am continuously moving, and you may be afraid whether you will be able to move any further.\nWhat I am saying today is nothing.\nAnd I am not going to be silent again either. I will go on saying things, more and more dangerous, unto my last breath. Even if I lose all the sannyasins, it does not matter.\nCHAPTER 5\nDiscontent: another name for inferiority complex\n2 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nDO YOU EVER GET SAD?\nReally a tough question! Yes and no. Yes, I get sad for you and for the world in which you are living. And you are not aware that you are living in the midst of a vast madhouse. You are so fast asleep, you don’t know what is being done to you, to others.\nThe politicians make me sad because they are the ugliest animals on the earth – continuously lying to people, exploiting people, humiliating people.\nBefore the last election in America, the governor of Oregon had a secret meeting of all the top officials of his government. The attorney general was there, Norma Paulus was there, and everybody who means anything in the government. They did not allow the journalists inside And still you go\non calling this a democratic country?\nThey were deciding about my people, but they did not allow any of my people to be present there. And the governor came out and gave a press conference in which he lied completely. What happened inside and what he said outside are completely contradictory. In the press conference he said, “Things are normal. There is no need to be afraid, everything is in control. We are trying to calm down the Rajneeshees.”\nI don’t know how he was trying to calm us down. He never came here, he never sent a message to us, but he was calming us down. Does he think he is a magician? And he said he was trying to keep the opposing people from getting too hot.\nInside, everything was different. Now the confidential record of the meeting has been found – he was thinking it had been burned. But in this world impossible things also happen. Now we know what happened inside the meeting; there was no question of calming anyone down, no question of creating peace. On the contrary, they were deciding how much time it would take their army to reach Rajneeshpuram to destroy it completely. They had decided to put the army on alert so any moment, within three hours, they could destroy my people.\nOf course, in a way it is calming us down. If you are not here, there will be calm. It has been calm here in this place for many decades, but that calmness was death. There was only one house, and there was only one family to look after this big place. It is one hundred and twenty-six square miles – three times bigger than New York. Of course it was calm. There were no birds to sing, there were no trees to blossom. It was a dead place; we made it alive.\nNow birds have started coming. Nature has a tremendous harmony when there are so many people loving, singing, dancing. Birds have started coming to this place, flowers have started blossoming.\nBut it is not noisy, it is not “hot” in the governor’s sense. You cannot find a cooler place in the whole world. Of course the sun is hot – that is not our fault. But the place is cool, calm, there is no disturbance. In these four years there has not been a single fight. But they want to destroy this calmness. They would love to have a dead place, the serenity of a cemetery.\nThere is serenity in a garden too. Do you think birds singing, flowers moving in the air, disturb anything? They make the silence deeper, meaningful. Silence in itself is meaningless unless it has the potential for a song, unless it has something in it to blossom, something to grow.\nIn the meeting they decided that the army should be put on alert, and the army was put on alert. And they were ready, in three hours, to destroy this place, these people. Of course we would have died singing and dancing. We would have made history.\nBut these people make me sad – and they are in power, and they go on lying. Now what do you call it – is it not a conspiracy, to tell the people that everything is normal? Then why is the army on alert? And what crime have we committed that we have to be destroyed?\nJust the other day the information came to me that in California, whenever there is a boxing match.… The University of California has been researching it, and they have found that whenever there is a boxing match in California, for a few days the murder rate goes thirteen percent higher than normal. And this is the murder rate – it says nothing about smaller fights, people wounded, rapes. Still boxing continues to be legal.\nThis place, where nobody fights, is illegal. People come close only to hug each other. This small and beautiful life is not to be wasted in fighting. That’s why I say yes, sometimes it makes me sad.\nWhen I look around the world... we are in exactly the same economic situation as the world was in before the second world war. The American dollar was going higher and higher, and all\nother countries’ economies were falling apart. This is the kind of atmosphere when war becomes\nabsolutely necessary.\nWhen I was in India the dollar was worth seven and a half rupees. Now it is worth twenty rupees – three times higher. The same is the situation in Germany, in England, in Holland – all over the world. The same was the situation before the second world war. You cannot live in an ocean of poverty, with economies failing, nations going bankrupt, people all over the world dying and starving. Sooner or later this euphoria of the American dollar will backfire; it will become an absolute necessity to start the third world war to divert people’s minds.\nSeventy-five percent of every nation’s income goes for war preparations. People are starving and dying – and you are creating bombs. Bread is needed, not bombs. Can’t you see the insanity?\nIsn’t there a single nation which can declare, “We are going to stop creating nuclear weapons at the risk of being defeated”? Anyway, a country like England, which has lived for three hundred years in great luxury, exploiting the whole world.… Now the empire has disappeared. England is dark, dismal; there is no hope – and still they are putting all their resources into creating nuclear weapons, knowing perfectly well that they can never again be a world power. They cannot compete with America or the Soviet Union, or even China.\nWhen you are not going to be a world power – even with nuclear weapons you will be defeated and destroyed – then what is the point of creating those weapons? In fact it is such a beautiful situation that you can dissolve all defense measures, you can stop having a defense ministry. There is no need; you will be defeated anyway.\nBut what to say about England? Even India, which is dying, goes on and on creating more and more war material. They are also after nuclear weapons.\nIn the history of man there has never been such a beautiful moment, when some courageous nation\ncan say, “There is no need for any defense. We are all human beings – who is going to attack us?”\nAnd do you see the cunningness? All these defense departments are not really for defense, they are for attack. Adolf Hitler attacked the world, but he had no department for attack. It was the defense department that was attacking.\nThe world will be going more and more into darker spaces, ditches. But nobody is ready to listen;\ntheir minds are conditioned so deeply that they are almost deaf. They hear, but they don’t listen.\nI just heard that one clergyman from Europe is here. He loves me, he has been coming to all the celebrations. But because I said something about Mother Teresa, he became very upset. This makes me sad. Why did he become so upset? Can’t he understand a simple thing? – that Mother Teresa is helping poverty to increase in the world, and poverty ultimately means war.\nHe said that his four girlfriends Strange, a clergyman having four girlfriends? Even I cannot afford\nthat. And nobody is there to prevent me, I am my own master; I don’t accept orders from anybody. Four girlfriends of his had been to Mother Teresa, and they all said that she is a nice woman. So what? There are millions of nice women, far nicer than Mother Teresa. And I have not said that\nshe’s not nice. Why do you get upset? Yes, she is a nice old witch. Now get upset. And pack your luggage and go back. Your love for me was of no worth.\nThis makes me sad. In these thirty years thousands of people have come along with me; they will go a few steps and then drop away. They had the potential, they had the courage; otherwise even to go a few steps with me towards the unknown is difficult. But after a few steps, why did they drop out? Something I said disturbed them. But they are not aware – it is not their consciousness which is disturbed, it is their conditioning which gets upset, disturbed.\nAre you going to listen to awareness or to all kinds of rubbish that rabbis, bishops, popes, mothers and fathers have forced into your head when you were very small and vulnerable?\nI sometimes feel puzzled: why do you call Mother Teresa “mother,” and why do you call the pope “father”? Popa in Italian means father. Instead of calling him pope start calling him popa – that sounds better. You call the pope, who has no children, “father.” You call Mother Teresa, who has no children, “mother.” Let these two get married. And put them on the pill, because we don’t want their progeny. Enough is enough!\nExistence does not make me sad. My own inner being for three decades has never felt a single moment of sadness for myself. I have completely forgotten the strategy, how to be sad. But what goes on happening around the world just brings tears to my eyes.\nThis world is not worth saving. Once in a while I think it will be better if the third world war happens and destroys this whole stupid humanity. Perhaps there is a time when a thing gets so rotten that it is better to burn it.\nConsciousness is eternal. Even if this earth becomes without human beings, I don’t see any problem in it. There are at least fifty thousand planets around the earth where life exists. Your consciousnesses will move to other planets. Nothing will be destroyed – only this ugly earth, these ugly politicians, priests; they will be finished.\nThis makes me sad: man on the earth has the highest quality of consciousness, and yet his behavior is barbarous. And everything that you call civilization is just a word.\nOnce a man asked George Bernard Shaw, “What do you think about civilization?” He said, “It is a good thing, but it has not happened yet.”\nWhat the religions go on doing around the world makes me sad. They go on making you more and more idiotic. Their basis is faith. They force every child to be faithful, a believer, and if possible, to be a fanatic believer. You will find all kinds of fanatics around. Even if you don’t want to be delivered, you don’t want to be saved, they will force you to be saved.\nThere are Christian sects who are self-appointed saviors. Who gives you the authority to save another? And are you certain that you are saved? Your face, your eyes do not give any proof of it; you look angry. Even a nice man like Jesus was an angry man. Who gave him the authority to beat the money-changers in the temple of Jerusalem and throw them out? Self-appointed judges.…\nJesus wanted to save the world – he could not even save himself. And he has left an ugly heritage which goes on growing like a cancerous growth, destroying everything that can raise you to beauty, to truth, to silence, to ecstasy.\nI have never seen a Christian ecstatic. Even Jesus was not ecstatic; he was burdened, and continuously having hallucinations. Now thinking oneself the only begotten son of God – do you think the man was sane? Thinking that he is the only real messenger bringing truth to humanity – do you think this man is mentally healthy? He is utterly sick, and Christians are sick.\nBut it is not only the Christians; the Hindus are in the same boat, the Mohammedans are in the same boat. Their names and their theologies and their scriptures are different, but the basic madness is there. They are all hallucinating.\nYour religions are nothing but opium. Drugs are prohibited – and the greatest drug is your religions. They should be abandoned, completely abandoned, if we want man to get rid of hallucinations. Otherwise, people are hallucinating that soon they will reach heaven and all the angels will be there dancing and singing, “Alleluia!”\nThere is no heaven, and there are no angels. Heaven is a state of consciousness. It is not a place. It is not part of geography; otherwise there would be very much confusion. In India, if you ask the Hindus where hell is, they say, “Just under us, deep down.” But if you make a hole from India deep down, you may enter Oregon – and their heaven is above. But the earth is round; everything is above, and everything from some angle, some place, is below. The Hindu’s hell is your heaven, your heaven is a Hindu’s hell.\nYou go on listening to these people, and you go on absorbing their nonsense in you. It is sheer poison. The politicians, the priests, make me sad. They are all programming your mind and changing it into a computer, a mechanism.\nMy work here is to deprogram you. Whether you get upset or not, I don’t care. You will get upset, because deprogramming is upsetting. You have believed a certain thing for fifty years, sixty years, and suddenly I say that it is nonsense. You cannot accept it, because that means you have been a stupid guy. But if you have guts and intelligence, there is still time to get out of the rut.\nI am, and my religion is, nothing but the science of deprogramming. And remember, don’t get mixed up with the deprogrammers that exist in California. They are not deprogrammers, they are REprogrammers. If any Christian moves away from Christianity, his parents becomes paranoid; they force the person to go to those so-called deprogrammers. They don’t deprogram him, they reprogram him. He was escaping from Christianity, they bring him back to Christianity. You call it deprogramming.…\nDeprogramming means that you are simply left without any program. You are left without any religion, you are left without any theology. You are left alone to be yourself, an individual.\nPeople go on asking me, “How many followers do you have?” I have not a single follower in the whole world, because my whole work is to destroy following, followers, and to create courage in people so they can stand on their own and be individuals.\nIt makes me sad that you are not individuals. Somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Buddhist. You are not individuals. You are blind followers, programmed by other blind followers.\nBut as far as I am concerned, there is no sadness in me. Day and night, I am in absolute bliss. That also makes me sad, that what is possible for me – an ordinary individual like me – why can’t it be possible for all? I do not claim any speciality. I do not claim that I am the only begotten son of God. I do not proclaim that I am the prophet bringing a fresh message from God.\nAll these prophets, messengers, avataras, are just holy shit! Of course, it has been clinging to you so long that when I start hitting you hard so that this holy shit drops, you get upset.\nI can understand, but I cannot stand it! Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nPLEASE COMMENT ON THIS STATEMENT BY J. P. MARKHAM: “I FEAR THE CONTENTED MAN. I\nFEAR HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROGRESS UNLESS THERE IS DISCONTENT.”\nI do not care whose statement this is. One thing I know, that discontent certainly makes you speedy. You go on running your whole life. You become just a vehicle that goes on moving faster and faster. But for what? I do not call it progress.\nYou may have all the money of the world, still you will be running after money. You may have all the knowledge, and still you will be running after more knowledge. In every dimension there is infinite space to run.\nI have heard A man and his wife were flying in a plane; the man was piloting. The plane was going\nfull speed, and the wife asked, “Where are we going?”\nThe man said, “Don’t bother where – look at the speed! We are certainly going SOMEWHERE.”\nDiscontent is another name for inferiority complex. Discontent means: you look around, people have this, people have that, and you don’t have it – you are discontented. But just seeing that somebody has it, you becomes discontented, you start feeling inferior. You have to surpass it, you have to get ahead. This continuous getting ahead is called progress – it is not progress. And this kind of progress begins even before your birth.\nWhen a man makes love to a woman, the living cells that he releases into the woman’s body start running. Progress begins there, because in a single lovemaking millions of living cells are released. They must have been feeling imprisoned in the man. Whenever they get the chance they go fast – you cannot understand how fast, because they are so small you cannot see them with your eyes.\nThe passage between them and the female egg, in proportion to their size, is almost two miles. And their life is very short, they are almost on their deathbed, because they can live for only two days, not\nmore than that. In those two days those tiny cells have to run two miles, with millions of competitors, and only one will reach the female egg.\nSometimes it happens, two reach at the same time – that’s why twins are born. Once the female egg opens and receives a male cell, it closes, and all those millions – those progressive people – simply die. If your lovemaking is counted, you have been murdering millions of people your whole life.\nAnd don’t think that the celibate monks are not murdering. Their cells die in imprisonment – at least you give them a little freedom, a little democracy, a little chance to progress. The celibate monk, Catholic or Hindu, does not allow those poor people to get out of his body. Yoga has methods to go on preventing them from getting out of you. They go on dying within you.… You are eating, you are getting nourishment, and it is a natural process. The body goes on; the body knows no religion.\nThe body goes on doing its function. It is programmed by nature, not by any priest – it will go on creating new blood cells, it will go on creating new semen cells, it will go on creating everything that the body needs. But when new living semen cells are created, the old have to die and vacate the place. The new ones have come – the new generation has come and the old generation has to go. There is not much space for all of them to coexist.\nWhen you think of progress... it starts with your lovemaking – a mad race – and where do you end? You end with a woman. Great, just great!\nAnd then your whole life it is the same, the same story. People are running after power, people are running after money, people are running after respectability. People are running after everything you can imagine, and where do they end up? Even if you reach the last rung of the ladder – there is no such thing, just for argument’s sake I am saying it – even if you reach the last rung of the ladder, what will you do then?\nI remember I was driving and a dog started following my car, chasing – he was hot, really progressive, very discontented. But he was not acquainted with me. He must have chased other cars.…\nI stopped the car – the poor dog was huffing, his tongue was hanging out. I stopped the car and\nasked the dog, “What now? What do you want?”\nAnd the way the dog looked at me... Ronald Reagan would also look the same way!\nEven if you become the president of a country, or a prime minister of a country, so what? You call it progress? It is obsession with speed.\nDiscontent brings conflict because it brings competition. If you are running, others are also running. There is going to be competition, there is going to be cut-throat competition. Hence all these wars.\nThe Polack pope is reaching out to the Christians around the world with the message, “Drop your antagonism with the Jews.” The Christians cannot understand. For two thousand years they have been KILLING Jews. When Adolf Hitler killed almost one million Jews in Germany, the high priest of the Christians in Germany blessed him; he had done a great religious act by removing these Jews.\nFor two thousand years Christians have been killing Jews because Jews killed Jesus; and nobody bothers about the fact that Jesus was a Jew, he was not a Christian – it is none of your business! If Jews want to kill another Jew, it is their internal affair. Jesus never claimed that he was a Christian. If he had claimed that he was a Christian, he would not have been crucified – then, who bothers?\nJews were upset because he was saying he was their Lord, that he was coming from God just as Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel and other prophets have come. And in a way he is higher than all those prophets, because they were only postmen, nothing much. He is the only begotten son. Naturally this Jew was going to be killed by the Jews. But they killed a Jew, they never killed a Christian. Christians have been killing Jews. I don’t see the mathematics of it.\nAnd how after two thousand years it happens in a Polack mind... and it is known all over the world that anything like mind does not exist in them, they are empty bottles of alcohol. If you are a cannibal and you eat a Polack, you will know what I mean. Just a little taste of a Polack and you will go unconscious!\nThis Polack popa is trying to create a bridge, a communication between the Christians and the Jews. Why? These things are not religious, these things are political. After the second world war they created a Jewish nation, Israel. Jews think the Americans, the British and other allies – who were all Christian – have done a great favor to them; it is not so. It was a very cunning strategy.\nIsrael is the holy land of the Jews, and also the holy land of the Christians. It was not in existence centuries ago – because the population was Mohammedan; there was no Israel before 1945. There used to be a nation, Palestine, which is no longer anywhere; it simply disappeared.\nChristians could have taken possession of Israel, but they were aware that if they took possession of Israel, then Jews would be against them all over the world. And Israel is surrounded by Mohammedans, the whole of the Middle East is Mohammedan; Israel itself is full of Mohammedans. It would create a conflict, a war, a continuous war between Christians on the one side and Jews and Mohammedans on the other side. In fact, Mohammedanism is closer to Judaism than Christianity is; much of Mohammedanism is borrowed from Judaism.\nTo avoid this situation of having Jews against them The politicians could not do that, because if the\nJews are against the Christians, then who is going to donate to their election funds? It would have been disastrous, particularly in America, because all these politicians in America are supported by Jewish money.\nAnd it was in the hands of America, because American forces were there in Israel to hand over the country to anybody – either to Christians or to Mohammedans or to Jews. It was a Mohammedan country and it would have been right to give it back to them. But Christians are against Mohammedans for a very simple thing – that’s why I say this whole world needs to be finished – a very small problem.\nMohammedans accept Jesus as a prophet of God but not as a son of God. And they are very logical about it: where is the wife? There is nobody, other than the holy ghost. And nobody knows about the holy ghost, to what sex he belongs. Is he male? Certainly Christians cannot accept that he is female, because to raise woman so high that she becomes part of the trinity, the highest in\nexistence... the holy ghost has to be male. But that makes God a homosexual, and homosexuals\ndon’t produce children. Then Jesus’ whole position becomes very strange.\nHence Mohammedans say Jesus is a prophet, a messenger of God, but not a son of God; God has no relatives. This is the only difference. And Christians and Mohammedans have been killing each other for fourteen hundred years. These things should be laughed at, not fought for.\nThe Americans could not give it to Mohammedans, although the country was Mohammedan, and it had been under the Mohammedans for a long time. They could not keep it for themselves, because that would mean creating two enemies: Jews and Mohammedans. They found a very political and cunning way: they gave it to the Jews. In that way they created a bridge between Jews and Christians, a friendship; they avoided one enemy, the Jews, avoided the other enemy, the Mohammedans, and very cleverly put the Jews in such a bad situation that they will continually have to fight with the Mohammedans.\nNobody can see any end to it because the country is Mohammedan, it belongs to the Mohammedans. It was forcibly taken and given to the Jews. This gave a very good opportunity to American Christians to get more donations from Jews; and it was a very good situation: they need not kill Jews, Mohammedans will kill them. Can you see the strategy? – so beautiful, so sophisticated.\nMohammedans will kill them – they have been killing them – on the one hand; on the other hand, the Jews will remain dependent on Christian countries. Israel is not independent; if America stops giving support to them, they will be finished within minutes. They have to remain under American control. Israel is nothing but a slave country of the Christians. And it will have to remain a slave; otherwise Mohammedans will kill it.\nAmerican politicians have done a good job. Jews think they have been favored; that is nonsense. They have been put in such a fix that they will never be out of it. And Christians have made a great step towards absorbing them. That has been the desire of Christianity: to absorb the whole world.\nThis hand of friendship is a not a hand of friendship. It is a hand that wants to destroy you. Jews are in tremendous discontent, Mohammedans are in tremendous discontent, Christians are in tremendous discontent. Whoever has said that discontent is needed for progress? Humanity has been in discontent for as far back as you can imagine. What progress has happened?\nYes, you have better roads, you have better machines, you have high technology – but you don’t have a better man. And your high technology, your nuclear weapons, your so-called good roads, beautiful buildings – without a good man they are just dangerous; not only useless, very dangerous. It is giving a naked sword into the hands of a child. Man remains retarded and he is being given nuclear weapons.\nI have heard When Ronald Reagan became the president of America, he was on a morning walk\non a beach with his favorite friend, a chimpanzee. Great progress is happening: chimpanzees are friends of presidents! One man sitting there on the beach was very much puzzled. He said, “Mr. President, sir, am I hallucinating? What is this chimpanzee doing with you?”\nReagan said, “You are not hallucinating, he is my friend.”\nThe man said, “I am not asking you, I am asking the president. Don’t interfere.”\nIn the first world war, for the first time psychoanalysts were employed by the governments to find out the intelligent quotient – I.Q. – of the soldiers. And it was a shock: the average man’s mental age is close to fourteen years. He may be seventy years old, but his mental age is not more than fourteen – it may be less.\nWhat progress has happened? You have not been able even to keep a synchronicity between man’s physical age and his psychological age, and you call your world a civilized world – where everybody is retarded?\nBut these retarded people are needed by the politicians, by the priests, by all the vested interests, because if a man’s intelligence also grows along with his body, then he will not become just old; he will grow up. His old age will be a beautiful experience. He will be able to drop all the conditionings which have been forced upon him.\nBut a retarded person cannot do that. He cannot even understand anything higher. He cannot even understand Leonardo da Vinci, he cannot understand Kalidasa, he cannot understand Rabindranath Tagore, he cannot understand Lao Tzu. He can only understand third-rate newspapers – the OREGONIAN. Yes, that he can understand.\nHe can follows a man like Reverend Jim Jones. Only a retarded man can do that. It is not a surprise that Jim Jones’ followers were all black. Of course, they are more retarded than the white people; they have lived in slavery for so long, uneducated, humiliated – they are not first-class citizens. They have not been treated as human beings. Reverend Jim Jones had not a single white man as his follower. Those who died, committed suicide in Jonestown, were retarded people.\nA man of intelligence would like to love, to live, to laugh. A great opportunity has been given by existence; he would like to drink out of it to the fullest. He would like to squeeze all that life contains.\nBut Jim Jones convinced those fools to commit suicide. Of course Christianity has the ultimate responsibility for it, because Reverend Jim Jones was an ordained Christian priest. Of course the cross is the symbol of suicide, and the whole teaching of Christianity is not for living joyously.\nIf Jesus can convince retarded people in Judea that when he reaches God, soon after they will all\nfollow himHe never defined how long this “soon” is. Two thousand years have passed; the “soon” is still there. Jim Jones carried the logic to its very end. He said, “Why should I wait there and and you wait here? You die with me, so we all go together.” He convinced those retarded people to commit suicide.\nRetarded people can be convinced about anything. Retarded people are being convinced to go to Vietnam to kill innocent people who have done no wrong to them. They can be sent anywhere, can be convinced to do anything.\nJapan had suicidal soldiers – a separate division. They would take an aeroplane full of bombs, and the pilot knew he was not going to come back, but he was dying for his country. Only retarded people can be convinced to die for a country. What is a country? Where is Palestine? And for Palestine people have been dying. Countries exist only on the map; the earth is one.\nThat’s why I say Rajneeshpuram is not in America, not in Oregon. This whole earth is ours. Rajneeshpuram is the capital of the whole world.\nWe don’t believe in nations. It is idiotic – what is the need of all these nations? Yes, a world government is needed, but not nations. Unless we create a world government, wars will continue because these nations will go on fighting – India with Pakistan, China with India – the war will continue somewhere or other.\nThe only way to stop war is not what the pacifists go on doing – carrying posters in processions. There are a few people who enjoy it; it is good exercise. And they are boiling because of discontent, so it is good in a way to shout slogans; it releases something in them. But these pacifists are not going to stop the war that is just on the horizon. Any moment, any chimpanzee can trigger it.\nTomorrow is more uncertain than it has ever been. The next moment is more uncertain than it has ever been.\nProtest, protest marches, slogans – this is not going to help. These people are exactly the same retarded people, they are just on a lower rung of the ladder. I have been watching these pacifists and their processions, their shouting and their slogans. It does not give the sense of peace; these are warmongers. Perhaps they are ready to fight for peace.\nThere is only one way: nations should disappear, they are an unnecessary burden on us. The world can easily be one, there is no need of different colors on the map. If the world dissolves the nations, whom are you going to fight? And if the world becomes a little more intelligent and drops all religious nonsense, whom are you going to fight? And if you are not going to fight, there will be no Ethiopia, there will be no poor India – because all your energy, all your money, all your resources that are going into war efforts will be freed. The whole humanity can live richly.\nPeople ask me, “What are you doing for Ethiopia?” Whatever I am doing, I am not sending Ethiopia some bread, some butter – that is not going to help. In the first place it is never going to reach Ethiopia, it will reach the Christian missionaries. In the last year they collected fifteen million dollars in America for Ethiopia. All has disappeared, it never reached Ethiopia. The same has happened before; Ethiopia has been in trouble for four years. In the name of humanity, service, these missionaries collect the money and swallow it.\nLast year when the fifteen million dollars simply disappeared, it was enquired what had happened. The Christian missionaries said they did not want to send the money to the Ethiopian government, so they found a French agency to distribute the money, food, clothes, to the starving Ethiopians. When the French agency was asked, they could not believe it; they had never heard about these missionaries.\nEthiopia will be there, more Ethiopians will be there tomorrow. Small efforts won’t help. I don’t\nbelieve in throwing a spoonful of sugar into the ocean to make it sweet. I am not retarded.\nThis Ethiopia, this India, the poor countries in the East, in Africa – this is your doing! First you create the problem, and then you start talking about serving humanity. Why create the problem in the first place? Dissolve all the nations if you have any love for humanity. And dissolve all the religions if you have any respect for civilization.\nA civilized man cannot be a Christian, a Jew, a Mohammedan. He cannot be an American, he cannot be an Indian. A civilized man is simply man. And if wars disappear, the world will not need priests to persuade you that “Blessed are the poor,” because there will be nobody who is poor. Then the priests will not be able to distract your mind towards heaven, because we can make heaven on this very earth.\nIf God has thrown out Adam and Eve, do tit for tat: throw him out. We will make the Garden of Eden here! Let God beg to come in.\nWhy should you pray and beg that you should be accepted, when we can create paradise here? But these politicians, these priests, go on diverting your energies. They are diverting science towards war. Science has now come to a point where it can make this earth so beautiful, so comfortable, so lovable that there will be no Jonestown. Nobody will want to commit suicide.\nIt is a discovery of scientific research that man’s body has an inner capacity to go on renewing itself – of course only for seventy, eighty years, and in rich countries for a hundred years. But in some countries even up to two hundred years the body remains young. We just have to put our scientific intelligence in the service of life – up to now it has been in the service of death. Man can live forever on this earth; there is no need to search for an eternal home beyond death – that is just a consolation for you.\nBut if you can be as blissful as they have been depicting people in paradise, naturally you won’t take any interest in their bibles, in their korans and gitas. You will not go to confess your sins, because there is no sin.\nPeople just need more understanding. People need more life, more wisdom, more clarity. You don’t\nneed to be forgiven. You have not done any wrong.\nYou have been doing only one thing wrong: you have been following idiots. God, who does not exist, may forgive you. I cannot forgive you for that.\nCHAPTER 6\nContentment is a state of consciousness\n3 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIF DISCONTENTMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO REAL PROGRESS, THEN IS THE CONTENTED MAN THE ALTERNATIVE?\nNo. The religions of the world have tried to create the contented man. The contented man is really the repressed man. He has all the desires, all the ambitions, but he is repressing them. He is very disturbed inside.\nSo I cannot say that the contented man is the alternative. I say contentment is the alternative. Don’t\nmisunderstand me. The point is a little delicate.\nContentment is a state of consciousness. And when there is contentment, there is no man, no\nwoman. There is no ego, there is no “I.” There is only contentment.\nIt is just like when you are silent. Is there a silent man? No, there is only silence. When you are in meditation, is there a meditator? No, there is only meditation. You disappear, you have to disappear, because you are discontent, you are disturbance. You are anguish, anxiety, despair.\nChristians say that there is only one sin God will not forgive, and that is despair. Perhaps that is the only statement I can agree with – not with the idea of God, but that despair cannot be forgiven. Despair simply means all these things together: anxiety, anguish, discontent, frustration.\nContentment is the answer. But the religions have been trying to create a pseudo type of contentment. They tell you that if you are poor, you are blessed; be contented with it: “God must have a design behind it, and you will be rewarded soon.” If there is any reward in the future, then your contentment is false. You are really suffering and waiting for the reward.\nAll the religions have been giving you rewards – or punishments. If you don’t listen to them, you will be punished; if you don’t follow them, then you are bound to go to hell. And the Christian hell is the worst, for the simple reason that you will be there for eternity. It is so illogical, so absurd, that even an idiot can understand it.\nChristianity believes in only one life – that means seventy years, eighty years, a hundred years. In a hundred years can you commit so many sins that the punishment will be for eternity, forever? Even Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse-tung – all three combined cannot manage to commit so many sins.\nBertrand Russell is right. He says, “If I count all my sins that I have committed, and also count all the sins that I wanted to commit but have not committed, even then, four or five years in hell would be enough – more than enough.”\nDo you know the psychological fact, that when you are in pain each moment becomes longer? Have you been at the bedside of a dying man in the night? It seems it is not going to end ever.\nTime is a relative phenomenon; it changes with your psychology. In pain, despair, anguish, it moves very slowly; in utter despair it seems that the clocks have stopped. When you are happy, blissful, time moves faster. Suddenly time appears to have wings. When you are with a friend, hours pass, and it seems you have just met. When you are with your lover, your beloved, then the night becomes very short. In fact, life seems so small to a lover that seventy years look like seven days or seven hours.\nEach moment in hell – Bertrand Russell is not aware of it – will be an eternity unto itself, what to say about being in hell for eternity? And what sins have you committed? Not many people are murderers, not many people are thieves, dacoits.\nWhat sins are you committing? Even to call them sins is wrong. They are only mistakes – human, expected. Because you are not all-knowing, mistakes are bound to happen. Because you are not omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, mistakes are bound to happen. To err is human. Anybody claiming infallibility is a criminal. Perhaps that is the only sin that you can commit.\nThe religions have created a false contented man – false because the man is trying to be contented, waiting for the rewards in heaven, in paradise. He is repressing here. He knows this life is small, much has passed, the remainder will also pass. He has become accustomed to its pain, its suffering, its frustration, its poverty. And deep down there is great hope that soon he will be in the blissful paradise – and forever.\nHave you ever considered that any pleasure, any happiness, if it continues forever, will not remain happiness anymore? Just think... kissing your woman forever. You will curse God.\nChange is beautiful, it keeps you moving. But the old religions are against change, they preach permanent things. And there is nothing which is permanent except change, because anything permanent becomes dead. If you are permanently in heaven, heaven will turn into hell. The very idea of permanence is non-existential.\nYes, the old religions have tried to create a contented man. It is a strategy to keep the poor, poor, a strategy against any rebellion, revolution. It is a strategy to keep the suffering, suffering; to find explanations for why he is suffering. Adam and Eve disobeyed God – that’s why you are suffering. Strange logic! You have never met Adam and Eve, it is simply a myth. Have you met serpents giving sermons?\nAnd disobedience is something very essential for every human being in becoming an individual. Not disobedience for disobedience’s sake – but when you see something irrational being imposed upon you, and you go on obeying it, you are going against yourself. You are destroying your humanity, you are murdering your individuality. You are becoming a slave.\nObedience is beautiful if it is in harmony with you, with your understanding, with nature. But disobedience is also beautiful. If man had continued to disobey the politicians and the priests, we would have been in a far more beautiful, peaceful, loving world. They don’t want you to disobey. They don’t want you to rebel, because of their vested interests. They want you to cling to the past, because that is the only way to exploit you.\nThe Hindu priest goes on exploiting millions of Hindus in the name of Krishna, in the name of Rama, who cannot be said even to be religious people – there is no question of their being incarnations of God. They have committed everything that is inhuman, ugly. And still Hindus go on worshipping them, because the priest is the mediator between the worshiper and the worshipped – nobody knows whom they are worshipping. The priest knows! The priest pretends to know, and imposes the idea on you that you don’t know, so whatever he says has to be obeyed.\nIn this twentieth century, in India, if rains are not coming, then all over the country jagnas – fire worship – is arranged. Millions of dollars are wasted to feed the brahmins, to pay their fees, because by their ritual... which is absurd – throwing into the fire valuable food, in a poor country which is starving, and repeating mantras from ten thousand-year-old Vedas.\nNobody understands what those mantras mean. Brahmins have been insisting that they should not be written in any language other than the original Sanskrit, because once they are translated you will laugh; they are stupid. And they have no connection with rain. They cannot persuade the clouds to come; there is no relationship at all.\nThere are mantras in the VEDASA brahmin is praying to God, “This year let your clouds rain only\nin my field, avoid the fields of my neighbors.” They are praying to God, “My cows should give more milk, and the cow of my enemy should not give any milk.” Great prayers! But in ancient Sanskrit, which is not understood, which has never been used as a language by people People have not\nbeen allowed to use it. It has never been a living language; it has been the monopoly of the priest.\nOut of hundreds of jagnas, rituals, sometimes rains come, and they say, “Look! The VEDAS are still significant, they are not outdated. Existence still listens to the prayers.”\nBut out of hundreds of rituals, ninety percent of the time rains are not going to happen. Then they are always ready to say that something has gone wrong. Mantras have not been chanted as accurately, as exactly as they should be. Brahmins have not been fed, have not been given their fees. Something must have gone wrong in the ritual; God is not happy.\nI am reminded that when I was in Poona.… Poona has seen its glorious days: ten thousand sannyasins were always there; all the hotels were packed, business was great. Although they were all against me, they never suspected that I am a very unreliable man. One day suddenly I left Poona.\nI live in the moment. I don’t care for the future. For me the present is enough.\nSuddenly I called my secretary and told her, “I want to leave this ugly place – dirty, full of lousy people.” Naturally when I left, slowly all the sannyasins left. Now Poona is in ruins.\nJust by the Poona commune there was a five-star hotel, the Blue Diamond. Before we reached Poona it was on sale because they were not making money, they were losing. It was a beautiful, big building, but only fifteen percent of the rooms were ever filled. They were not even able to pay the servants, the manager. When we were there, the Blue Diamond was overfull.\nThey had offered it to me, they were ready to sell it as cheap as possible. But when sannyasins started coming, and we needed space and enquired, “Are you still ready to sell it?” they said, “No, not at any price.”\nThe owner of the hotel is one of the richest men in India, Kirloskar. He was very much against me for a simple reason: his daughter is married to Morarji Desai’s son, and my friendship with Morarji Desai seems to be going on for many lives. I had to tell you this, otherwise you would not have understood.\nI have heard that Kirloskar himself arranged a vedic ritual – a hundred brahmins for seven days, throwing wheat, rice, milk, butter, into the fire and praying, “Bring Osho back to Poona.” But it is not going to happen; there is no God who can order me to go to Poona. What I have left behind, I have left behind. I go on breaking the bridges that I pass. Once is enough-the world is vast. But Poona became a world-famous name. Now all that glory has disappeared; no vedic ritual can help it.\nThese religions go on giving you hope. Hope is the poison; it keeps you dragging, waiting for the moment when the hope, the promise, will be fulfilled.\nChristians are waiting for Christ to come back. He said to them again and again, “I will be coming soon on the clouds of glory, with a divine body, for the salvation of all those who believe in me.” He has not come, and I can say to you categorically: he is not going to come again. What did you do to him when he was here? That experience is enough to prevent him – because I know if he comes back, you will crucify him again. But the hope.…\nHindus are hoping, because Krishna has promised – all these prophets go on promising – Krishna has promised that whenever there is misery, whenever there is irreligiousness in the world, whenever virtue disappears, whenever things are not as they should be, “I will be coming.” For five thousand\nyears everything has been wrong – but there is no sign of his coming back. But Hindus still go on living in hope, still they go on repeating the promise of Krishna, that soon he will be coming. This keeps people unconscious of the reality. It is opium – very subtle, very psychological.\nThe contented man has been created by this opium: here be contented, and there you will be immensely rewarded for your contentment. Don’t be bothered about the rich and the luxurious. It is just momentary; soon the rich will be suffering in hell. Don’t be jealous of them and don’t be competitive with them. Be contented.\nIndia, perhaps, is the oldest country in the world; its religions are certainly the most ancient religions. But in India not a single revolution has happened, and it has been suffering for thousands of years. Starvation, poverty, sickness – it has been living in a nightmare, but with the opium of hope: that the Hindus are the privileged people of God, and this is only a momentary life. The suffering is just a test of your faith. Once you have passed through the test, all the joys of heaven are yours.\nThat’s why I said I don’t want the contented man. That is false, pseudo, sick, retarded, believing in lies.\nI teach contentment. And the basic principle of contentment is to drop your ego. Don’t think for a single moment, “To be or not to be.” Just not to be is the rule. What have you gained by trying to be? Just for a change try not to be, and you will be amazed. The moment you are not, there is contentment, there is silence, there is beauty, there is bliss.\nMeditation is only a methodology to make you aware that your only disease is your ego, and your only health is egolessness.\nThe discontented man is suffering from his ego. He is comparing his ego with others. Somebody is more beautiful than you, somebody is stronger than you. Somebody is richer than you, somebody is more powerful than you. All around there are people who have something which you don’t have. You have to complete against the whole world – by any means, right or wrong, but you have to reach the top.\nSometimes I think of Edmund Hillary standing on the highest mountain, the Himalayan peak, Everest. There is not even space for two persons to stand together. And whenever I think of it, I think of poor Edmund Hillary. He must have looked silly. Now what to do? You have reached the top of the world, but what now? Jump and commit suicide.\nWhatever you can attain, you will remain discontented.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was not a very tall man, he was only five feet five inches. But I don’t see any problem. I am five feet five inches. I have tried to figure out why he was puzzled; I am not puzzled. Even if I were seven feet, my feet would touch the ground. At five-five they still touch the ground, so what is the problem? But Napoleon was very much disturbed, because his soldiers were taller than him, his bodyguards were taller than him. That was giving him a continuous feeling of inferiority.\nOne day it happened, he was trying to put a nail in the wall to hang a picture. His hand was not reaching to the right spot, and his bodyguard said, “Sir, you need not bother about it, I can do it – I am higher than you.”\nNapoleon Bonaparte imprisoned that guard, and told him, “You used wrong language. You are taller than me, but not higher than me!” That poor guard had unconsciously used a word that touched a deep wound in Bonaparte. Bonaparte had everything, but discontent was there.\nThere are ordinarily two types of people in the world: the discontented and the repressed discontented. I need the third type of man to evolve: the man who has no ego; hence, he cannot be discontented.\nContentment is not something to be practiced. When discontent disappears, you find contentment has always been your nature.\nDo you think a small bush is discontented because just by the side of it a tall cedar tree is standing, reaching to the stars? Do you think a small rose bush is discontented? There is no discontent in nature anywhere, except in the mind of man. It has been created by the politicians, by the priests, by the educationalists. Every child is being told to come first.\nMy father was a very simple man. He was not even aware – because he had eleven children – who was in which class and where. If some visitor, some guest asked him, he would have to call me and ask,\n“In what class are you?” He never asked me, “Have you passed or failed?”\nWhen I came first in the whole university, I thought, “He will be happy, I should inform him.” I told him, “I have come first in the whole university.”\nHe said, “So what! That simply means your whole university is full of stupid people; otherwise, how could you manage to come first?”\nI said, “That seems to be right” – and I threw the gold medal given to me by the university into the well.\nMy father said, “What are you doing?”\nI said, “I am simply destroying the gold medal, because I don’t want to be first amongst thousands of stupid people. I am perfectly okay as I am.”\nHe said, “But don’t burn your certificates. You will need them for employment.”\nI said, “Okay. For employment I will need them, but the moment I leave employment, the first thing I am\ngoing to do is to burn them all” – and that’s what I did.\nFor nine years I was a lecturer in the university. Then one day I left, because when I can share my silence, my ecstasy with millions of people, why should I waste my time with a dozen students, teaching them something which is of no use, something I am against?\nI had to teach Aristotle, and I think Aristotle is one of the most criminal minds in the whole of history. But I used to say that too. I would teach Aristotle, and then I would say, “Now, what I feel about Aristotle I have to say to you.”\nAristotle created a logic of duality: yes and no, and there is nothing in between; either something is or it is not. This is not true.\nLife is a rainbow... all the colors.\nBetween yes and no there are many stages.\nLife cannot be divided and cut into two separate parts. Life is an undivided rainbow – one color melting into another. Yes and no are two ends of the same rainbow, two colors of the same rainbow. They are not opposite to each other – that is Aristotelian logic – I say they are complementary to each other.\nBut it was a tedious job, first to teach Aristotle and then to contradict him. And my students became confused. They complained to the\nvice-chancellor, “What are we going to do? This man is strange. He teaches Immanuel Kant and contradicts him, he teaches Hegel and contradicts him. How are we going to answer in our examinations?”\nThe vice-chancellor told me, “You are creating trouble for those poor students.”\nI said, “I am not creating any trouble, I am simply giving them the whole picture. Now they can\nchoose. To give them only one side just to avoid their confusion is cheating.”\nMulla Nasruddin was made a judge. The first case came before him; he heard one side and started writing the judgment. The court clerk could not believe his eyes. He whispered in Nasruddin’s ear, “What are you doing? You have not even heard the other party.”\nNasruddin said, “I am not going to allow myself to be confused. Right now I am perfectly clear. Why should I listen to the other party and be confused?”\nI told the vice-chancellor the story of Nasruddin. I said, “Do you agree with Nasruddin?”\nHe said, “You are just impossible. Do whatever you want to do.” But I could not manage to remain confined in a university when the whole universe was available to me; soon I left. The first thing I did was, I burned all my certificates.\nI left Poona forever. Now they are praying for me. When I was there, they were trying to throw me out. Now they know all the joy and the dance and the beautiful people from all over the world no longer come there; they are coming here.\nHad you ever heard about Oregon before? It never existed. It has come to life for the first time, and you have brought your joy, your meditation, your contentment.\nMy sannyasins are contentment, not contented men. My sannyasins don’t care about politics. I have sometimes out of necessity to force them. Look at poor Krishna Deva. I had to persuade him to become mayor of Rajneeshpuram. Somebody has to be mayor. If you find somebody not dancing, looking sad, you have found K.D. Nobody is interested in politics here, nobody is on a power trip.\nContentment is a state of consciousness.\nI teach contentment.\nAnd out of contentment comes real progress.\nThe discontented man has created the world – ugly, disgusting. This is not progress. The repressed, so-called contented men – the monks of all the religions – what progress have they brought to the world? Yes, they have contributed something: homosexuality, lesbianism.\nHomosexuality, lesbianism, are very religious matters, because when you confine only men in a monastery, and you confine only women in a nunnery, what are they going to do with their sexuality? – which is natural, simple, not a sin. You are born out of it.\nEverything in existence is sex energy. Yes, it can be transformed, it can be raised higher, but you cannot deny it. The contented man created by the religions has denied it. But your denial will not make any difference to your physiology, your chemistry, your hormones. Your body is neither Christian, nor Hindu, nor Mohammedan. That’s why the same medicine works for all; otherwise there would be a Mohammedan cancer, and a Hindu cancer, and they would have different treatments for them. Your body is part of existence, it is existential. And my philosophy is pure existentialism.\nHomosexuality and lesbianism were born in monasteries. This is their contribution. AIDS is their contribution to the world – real progress! Who had heard about AIDS before? A great invention! What have they contributed to the world? Neither the discontented man nor the so-called contented man have given progress. Progress is possible only out of contentment.\nJust for a moment think that there is no ego in you, that you are simply nobody, and you will feel so clean, so pure. And out of that cleanness, purity, you will start growing, growing to be what your potential is. You may become a painter, you may become a musician, you may become a poet. You may become anything – a scientist, a dancer – but it will come naturally to you. When something grows naturally in you, there is progress. And if the world can be rich with music.…\nI say to my people, “Don’t listen to Jesus, who says everybody has to carry his cross, no.” I say to you, “Everybody has to carry his guitar.” Why carry a cross when guitars are available?\nJust grow to your potentiality – not according to any discipline, because then you will never be yourself; not according to any dogma, because that is distracting you from yourself. Without any dogma, without any religion... can’t you have a little courage just to be yourself? Part of this vast universe, nobody special And you are in for a great surprise.\nYes, there have been painters before: Picasso, Van Gogh, and hundreds of others. But have you ever thought that the paintings of Picasso are sick, insane? If you go on looking at a painting by Picasso, continuously for one hour sitting before it, meditating over it, then you will know what I mean. This is not a painting, it is a vomiting! That man was crazy, he vomited.\nOf course, if Picasso had been a contentment, a painting would have grown; it would not have been insane and crazy. Looking at it, you would have felt a serenity descending upon you. Watching it,\nyou would have felt peace surrounding you. But this is not possible with Picasso’s paintings – he is a very discontented man.\nThis is not possible with George Bernard Shaw’s books. You cannot find a bigger ego than George Bernard Shaw. He writes a play of fifty pages and gives it a one hundred fifty page preface. Can you think this man sane – a small play needs such a big introduction? Something is wrong with the man.\nWhen he got the Nobel prize, one day he remained silent, made no comment. He was in the headlines of all the third-class newspapers of the world. The second day, he rejected it; he said, “I don’t want to receive the Nobel prize because it is far below me! Give it to some amateur writer, a beginner. I have passed that stage long ago.” Again he was in the headlines.\nIt was an insult to the Nobel prize committee, which is presided over by the Norwegian king or queen. From all over the world, all the royalty, all the significant, powerful, important celebrities, thousands of telegrams poured in to Bernard Shaw, saying that this was an insult to Norway, an insult to the king, an insult to the Nobel prize committee.\nHe waited for two or three days, made a great fuss, and finally agreed to accept it. And all these days he was in the headlines. He accepted the Nobel prize – that was a great relief for all the royalty, and all the presidents, and all the premiers. And the next moment he donated it to a society; again he was news.\nFor almost two weeks he maintained himself as the most important news in the world, because it was discovered that the society to which he had donated the prize was his own society – he had named it the Fabian Society – and he was the only man in the society. He was the president, and he was the secretary, and he was the membership.\nAgain he was in the news. And when he was asked why he did it, he said, “When you get a Nobel prize you get headlines for just one day. I managed to have myself in the headlines all over the world for two weeks. Nobody can beat me!” His ego was like a balloon which went on getting bigger and bigger.\nThese people cannot create real art. Their art is going to be a reflection of their mind.\nProgress out of contentment will be totally different. Poetry will arise in you, just like a rosebush grows. It will give flowers to the world, and the fragrance – and without any claim for any reward, because contentment is its own reward. What more can you want than to come to fruition, to flowering? What can give you more blissfulness than just to grow into your real potential?\nI do not promise anything to you. I have no theology of hell or heaven – those are all bogus, created by fools for other fools. In my vision the very contentment is the reward, the very silence is the reward, the very meditation is the reward.\nAnd nobody can feel inferior to you. A contented man, if his contentment is of the old pattern, is going to feel either inferior or superior – which are not different, they are two sides of the same coin.\nI have heard.… Three Christian monks met on a crossroad. One of them said, “I highly appreciate your monasteries, but our monastery is more scholarly than your monasteries.” Remember the “more.”\nThe second one said, “That’s perhaps true, but my monastery is more ascetic. I have every respect for your monasteries” – this is all garbage, this respect, it is all phony – “but as far as ascetism is concerned, as austerities are concerned, you come nowhere close to us.”\nThe third one said, “I also have great respect for your scholarship, for your austerities, but in humbleness we are the tops.”\n“In humbleness, we are the tops”! I am not talking about this kind of contented man. A real contentment will make you humble, but not the tops. Humbleness will come naturally to you. A real contentment will give you, without any effort, a respect for all that exists. It is not etiquette, it is not British; you will simply respect. How can you disrespect?\nA tree, a bird on the wing, a cloud just floating, a river flowing to the ocean, a child smiling; an old man with all the experience of life; a child with all the freshness of life.…\nWhom can you disrespect? How can you feel superior to anybody? Can you feel superior to a rose? Can you feel superior to a bird on the wing? How can you feel inferior to anybody? You have all the contentment, all the serenity, all the silence. Where can that dark wound – inferiority – exist in you? You are all light.\nThis is the man who can bring beauty to the world – songs of silence, out of silence; really authentic poetry. This man will transform the whole nature of science. Progress will not stop, but it will have a different dimension to it.\nNow the whole of science is devoted to destruction. Albert Einstein cannot be forgiven; he was the man who wrote to President Roosevelt that the atom bomb can be created, and that it is the only way to defeat the fascist forces in the world. He repented his whole life, but that repentance cannot restore Hiroshima. It cannot give life back to thousands of children, women, men, trees, in Nagasaki, in Hiroshima.\nEinstein was an unconscious scientist – it was out of discontent. Basically he was a German, but unfortunately a Jew; he had to escape from Germany. He was doing the same work for Adolf Hitler. If he had remained in Germany, perhaps there would have been no Nagasaki, no Hiroshima. There may have been London, New York, Washington, Moscow, but not Nagasaki and Hiroshima.\nEinstein escaped out of the fear that because he was a Jew he might get into trouble. And as a revenge against Adolf Hitler, he wrote the letter to President Roosevelt. He was not aware of what he was doing. He created the atom bomb, and he awoke only when Nagasaki and Hiroshima were finished. But it was too late.\nI don’t teach you repentance. Christians teach you repentance – naturally, because they don’t make you alert, aware, meditative, contented. So out of your unconsciousness, out of your discontent, out of your tense mind, out of your anxiety, you are going to do something for which you will repent\nlater. But it is always too late! It may help you to feel less guilty, but that does not change anything in existence; you have committed a crime. And Albert Einstein understood it. Before his death he was asked, “If there is another life after death, would you not like to remain a physicist?”\nHe said, “No! I would rather be a plumber, but never again a physicist.”\nThis kind of science will disappear. Out of peace, the whole dimension will change. Progress will not stop, but progress will be for the benefit of humanity, for the benefit of the whole existence. Science is capable, if it is in the hands of contented, meditative people, of feeding the whole earth abundantly, of creating everything that is needed – not just for survival, because survival is not life. Life has to be overflowing, it has to be luxurious. A rosebush just surviving somehow is not going to give you roses.\nThe earth can become abundant with everything. Science just has to be creative and not destructive. A contentment inside you will not allow you to be destructive.\nIf all the scientists of the world simply revolt against the politicians, the world will see a tremendous transformation. But there are very few scientists who have guts, because their guts have been destroyed by their educational system.\nI am reminded of Sakharov. He was given the Nobel prize because he was the best physicist of his time. But he was a Russian. He was director of the Academy of Sciences in Russia, the highest post for a scientist – position, respect. The Russian government did not want him to receive the Nobel prize because it comes from capitalist countries, and in the Russian mind – particularly in the communist party and the people who are in power there – it is a kind of bribe, in the name of a prize.\nThey do the same on their own, so they know; they give the Lenin prize in capitalist countries. And by giving the Lenin prize they are bribing the person to reveal secrets. So they don’t want any Russian to receive the Nobel prize, because that way he becomes sympathetic towards capitalist countries.\nSakharov is really an individual. The whole communist programming has not been able to destroy his spirit. He went against the Russian government, knowing perfectly well what had happened before to those who had not listened to the Russian government. Two other scientists had been given Nobel prizes before Sakharov. They did not listen to the government; they accepted the prize. They were not allowed to go out of the country to receive it; on the contrary, they were imprisoned, tortured – and Russia has really progressive ways of torturing.\nFor fifteen days those two scientists were kept awake. They were given injections so they could not fall asleep. The mind is a very delicate thing; if for two weeks continuously not a single moment of sleep is allowed, the person starts losing his rationality, sensitivity. After fifteen days he has lost all interest in science. After twenty-one days he has lost interest in his family. After thirty days he has lost all interest in himself; the mind is dismantled. And then he is brought before a court. Of course, the court judges him to be mad.\nFirst you make him mad, and then you bring him before a court! This had happened to those two scientists, and because they were mad and dangerous, they were both exiled in Siberia. Nobody knows what happened to them.\nSakharov knew what he was doing: when he accepted the Nobel prize the same would happen to him. And he accepted the Nobel prize, and the same happened to him. He was immediately removed from his power and position. His car was taken away.… A car is a great luxury in Soviet Russia, because only very powerful people can have their own private vehicle. Everybody else has to use the public system – buses, trains.\nI am against communism, because if a person is deprived of his private possessions, something of his individuality dies. His private possessions are a kind of safety around him, that keep him alive as an individual.\nSakharov’s salary was cut, his car was removed, he was not allowed to go out of Russia. And then finally he was sent to Siberia. He is still alive. The best physicist of the world is simply rotting in Siberia! – and nobody bothers about it.\nJust this incident of Sakharov should have been enough for all the scientists of the world – not only of Soviet Russia – to simply disconnect themselves from their governments. And if the politicians are so interested in fighting, they can have wrestling matches and you can enjoy it. They can have boxing matches, and you can enjoy it. If those fools insist on fighting, perfectly good. The Soviet prime minister wrestles with Ronald Reagan – enjoy it, there is no harm. But these people should not be given power to destroy the whole humanity.\nMy people cannot in any way create anything that will be harmful. They can create only something which will be a joy to see. They have created this small commune which has become a nightmare to the politicians of America.\nWe are not doing anything except making this land, which has remained barren for years, green again. We are dancing, singing, meditating, farming, gardening. We are not doing any harm to anybody. Even deer understand it, but the attorney general of Oregon cannot understand it. You can see in the evening, deer moving on the road without any fear. You go on honking your horn and the deer does not care. He knows these people are not destructive.\nMy own peacocks in my garden make me come here late sometimes. They will not move from the road, they will walk just ahead of me. When I go back, they are all ready just in front of my porch, dancing. I have to stop the car and wait till they decide to give way to me. They know perfectly well nobody is going to harm them.\nDeer have come, birds have come. Even the poor juniper has become a rich tree. When I came here these junipers were just dying, somehow managing at a survival level. The juniper is a very strong-willed tree. Where nothing else can exist, the juniper can. But no birds to sing, no people.…\nYou have to understand: this existence is a cosmos, it is a deep harmony. When people moved here, suddenly birds started coming, deer started coming. Even junipers understood the presence of my people. They are far greener, far thicker, far bigger than they were when I came here.\nThere is a deep connectedness in life. You cannot live without trees, trees cannot live without you. When you inhale, you need oxygen; when you exhale, you exhale carbon dioxide. The tree does just the opposite: when it inhales, it takes in carbon dioxide; when it exhales, it exhales oxygen.\nLife is a harmonious whole. Everything is connected with everything else. The smallest leaf of grass is connected to the farthest star, a star you cannot see. Harming a small grass flower, you are harming the whole existence, because nothing is separate.\nContentment brings you insight into this wholeness. And I call only that man holy who understands this wholeness of everything. I call that man holy who can understand that sex and silence are not separate, that sex and meditation are not separate. Nothing is separate. Everything is woven into everything else. All colors are mixing with each other.\nI have an idea – I’m just waiting for the right time. I would like my sannyasins to wear rainbow clothes. But I have to wait a little and keep you in red clothes for two reasons: one, to shock the fools outside; and two, so that I can recognize you easily. But before I leave this world, you will be in rainbow clothes.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AS I LISTEN TO YOU, IT SEEMS YOU ARE TRYING TO BE A MARTYR. ARE YOU?\nI am not even a Christian – why should I like to be a martyr? The word looks beautiful, but the reality is that those who would like to be martyrs are suicidal.\nJesus was suicidal; he was trying in every way to be crucified. He was not even courageous enough just to shoot himself. Why unnecessarily make other people responsible for your crucifixion? If Jesus had shot himself, the Jews would have lived in peace without any trouble. But he forced the Jews to do it.\nIt is to Sigmund Freud’s credit that he discovered a suicidal instinct in man. It was always accepted that man has a deep lust for life; he wants to live and live, and live forever. But in existence nothing exists without its opposite. That was the discovery of Sigmund Freud, and it is absolutely right – with the life instinct there is a death instinct. There is not a single man on the earth who has not at least once thought of committing suicide. From where does that idea come?\nBut a man who is contented has all the bliss that is possible. Both the instincts simply disappear. He has no desire to go on living; he has no desire to destroy himself by his own hands or by other people’s. For him this moment is all. Whatever happens in the next moment is welcome.\nI have no desire to be a martyr, but if somebody kills me, what can I do? It will be absolutely their responsibility. As far as Jesus is concerned, Jews are not absolutely responsible. Ninety percent of the responsibility is Jesus’ himself. If Mansoor is killed by the Mohammedans, even more – ninety- nine percent of the responsibility is al-Hillaj Mansoor’s.\nIf Gandhi is shot, one hundred percent of the responsibility is his, because before his death he is reported to have said many times, “Now I don’t want to live. It will be a mercy if God takes me away from this body, because I have become absolutely useless.”\nStrange To think in terms of use is ugly. Neither do you have to use anybody – because to use\nsomebody is to exploit them – nor do you have to allow anybody to use you. That is your birthright.\nGandhi wanted to die, and he was praying for death. That makes one thing very clear. When Nathuram Godse shot him.… It is good that Nathuram has “Ram” in his name: Ram was Gandhi’s God.\nNathu is meaningless. In India, if a couple finds that their children die and don’t survive, then something has to be done. So when a new child is born, either his nose is pierced – a hole is made so a ring of gold can be put through – or his ears are pierced and rings of gold are put in. Nathu means nose, so if the nose is pierced, Ram becomes nathuram. If the ears are pierced, Ram becomes kunchiberam – kun means ears.\nIn fact he was just a”Ram” with a pierced nose – Gandhi’s God. And when Gandhi was shot, he put his hands together, looking at Nathuram Godse, and the words he uttered were, “Hey, Ram.” He was waiting for it; that’s why I say one hundred percent. And he was rejoiced – he wanted to die, because his ideology was no longer listened to. Nobody was ready to follow his suggestions.\nThe country had become free. Gandhi was needed when the country was under slavery, under British rule, because he controlled the masses. The superstitious Indians cannot be controlled by logic, by reason. They can only be controlled by their emotions, sentimentality, superstitions, religiousness, and all kinds of rubbish. Gandhi was an expert in rubbish.\nI have no desire to live the next moment, or to die the next moment. I have known and experienced everything that is possible. If existence allows me one moment more, I will create a little more disturbance in people. If existence feels that I am no more needed, it is perfectly good to go into eternal sleep. To me, death is not going to be a death, because I am not going to be reborn.\nYou are reborn if you have committed mistakes, and if you feel guilty. Albert Einstein must have been reborn, and of course, as a plumber, because the last desire becomes the seed for your future life. I have no desire. My death will not be a death.\nIn India we make a difference. When an ordinary man dies, it is death. When someone who has attained enlightenment dies, it is samadhi, it is not death. And the word “samadhi” is immensely significant. Samadhi means: one who has attained the ultimate harmony with existence.\nCHAPTER 7\nA sannyasin is extraordinarily ordinary\n4 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nI CAN’T CONCEIVE OF YOU EVER BEING UNENLIGHTENED. DID YOU REALLY BECOME\nENLIGHTENED ONLY THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO?\nNeither can I conceive it. This is one of the very fundamental things in the nature of enlightenment. Once you are enlightened, you are in a very strange situation – trying to conceive how you could manage to remain unenlightened for so many lives. It is a tremendous work, it needs great effort. Misery, jealousy, competitiveness – all that is ugly is needed to remain unenlightened.\nEnlightenment itself is simple, it is natural. Unenlightenment is your creation.\nEnlightenment is a gift from existence. So it is up to you how long you want to remain unenlightened. Any moment you can drop unenlightenment. Never ask how to become enlightened, because nobody can become enlightened. Everybody is born enlightened. Just ask, “How can we drop all those props that are keeping us unenlightened?”\nThere is a beautiful story in Gautam Buddha’s life. Again and again he has told it.…\nIn one of his past lives he met an enlightened being. Out of respect he touched his feet. But he was surprised – in return the enlightened man touched his feet. Buddha could not believe his eyes. He said, “What are you doing? I am an unenlightened man, ignorant. I have not experienced truth. I\nhave not yet been able to love, to be compassionate. My laughter is still phony, my heart is full of\ndiscontent. Why have you touched my feet?”\nAnd the enlightened being laughed. He said, “Don’t be worried. As far as I am concerned, you are as enlightened as I am.”\nFrom your side, that is your problem – I don’t see any of you here as unenlightened, it is impossible. Enlightenment is your very center, your very being. But you have been conditioned, programmed to remain unenlightened. All your religions are responsible for it. They don’t want you to become enlightened, because an enlightened man cannot be a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan. From his state of consciousness, all these theologies, religions, are sheer nonsense – fictions created by ignorant people for other ignorant people.\nNever ask how to be enlightened. You can ask how to remain unenlightened, that is relevant. If you want to be enlightened, you are this very moment. Nobody is preventing you except yourself.\nAnd you are making so much hard, arduous effort to become enlightened. That is one of the ways to remain unenlightened. The very effort keeps you troubled; and each effort is going to fail, because what you are already you cannot become.\nJust see the difference between these two simple words: being and becoming. Enlightenment is being – you cannot become it. Becoming is a process somewhere in the future after long journeys, doing all kinds of stupid things – yoga postures, Christian prayers, fasts, remaining celibate, entering into a monastery forever, you will not come out of it.…\nThere are monasteries where you enter but unless you are thrown out you cannot get out; only your dead body comes out some day. I have heard about such a monastery. It was famous for two things: one, for one thousand years no woman had entered into the monastery – it was prohibited. Even a six-month-old baby girl was not allowed.\nWhen I heard about it I thought, were monks living in the monastery, or monsters? A six-month-old baby is not allowed in! You can conceive the mind of those people who are living inside.\nAnd second, it was famous in that silence was the rule. Only after seven years – once, after seven years – if you wanted to say something to the abbot, you could say it, and then for seven years again silence.\nOne man became a monk. For seven years he suffered, because the mattress was missing, he was sleeping on a bare floor. It was hard, it was cold, but he had to wait for seven years to say, “I need a mattress.”\nSeven years, by and by, passed – they must have looked to that man almost like seven centuries. And he was so happy when he went to the abbot and said, “Master, I have a complaint to make. In the room you have allotted me, there is no mattress. And for seven years I have been prohibited from speaking.”\nThe abbot said, “Okay, a mattress will be provided immediately. You go back.”\nA mattress was provided. But the cell in which the monk was living was very small, and the door was very small, and the mattress was big. So while they were bringing the mattress in, the door fell out and the window’s glass was broken. Somehow they forced that big mattress into the small room. For seven years the poor man again suffered – from rain, wind, snow, because there was no door and the window was broken. In fact, he started thinking that the first seven years were far more beautiful: “I was an idiot to make that complaint!”\nAgain after seven years he went to the abbot. And the abbot said, “Again?”\nThe man said, “I have to say something, I am compelled to say it: the mattress that was provided was bigger than my cell, and the people, the other monks who brought it, somehow forced it in. I could not say no – I could not speak. They broke the door, they broke the window, and you can conceive – for seven years I have been living in wind, in rain, in snow. I was not thinking that I would be able to survive, but somehow by God’s grace I am here again. Please put the door back and mend the window.”\nThis was too much. The abbot became angry, and he said, “In all these fourteen years you have done nothing but complain, complain, complain! This is not a way to be religious. You simply get lost!”\nEnlightenment is not something to be achieved. It is not an achievement, it is not a goal far away that you have to journey to. It is not a pilgrimage at all. The more you seek and search for enlightenment, the more you will miss it, and the more miserable you will be.\nEnlightenment is a very simple understanding. So once you stop all efforts to be enlightened and just remain at ease with yourself, totally accepting yourself as you are.… That’s how existence meant you to be. Don’t try to improve upon existence, you cannot do that. Relax, be existential, not religious. And suddenly you are amazed, “My God! I have always been enlightened.”\nYour question is right. After enlightenment everybody is amazed – and knows that he has always been enlightened.\nThirty-two years ago I awoke from the nightmare of making a continuous effort to attain enlightenment. I simply dropped all efforts to be enlightened. I simply accepted myself as I am – good or bad. I simply stopped judging myself. And a miracle happened: with judgment disappearing, with ambition to become enlightened disappearing, it was as if I came out of a nightmare fully awake. And when I saw myself as enlightened, I saw the whole existence as enlightened.\nYou are part of a tremendous blissfulness, but you are keeping yourself closed. You go on doing something against nature, against existence. You have been taught that to be natural is something wrong; you feel guilty when you are natural. You feel happy when you repress your nature, when you become phony, a hypocrite. All religions have been doing only one thing for thousands of years: making people hypocrites.\nI want you to drop all that crap, and just be yourself – with no effort to go anywhere, because you are already there, this very moment.\nI know about a man who is present amongst you, his name begins with “T”. Forgive me, I cannot tell you his full name. I know his tent number, but I cannot tell you the tent number. He has come here to assassinate me.\nI cannot tell you his name and his tent number, because I don’t want to interfere in anybody’s life. If he wants to assassinate me, and can have a moment of joy – I have had enough, so let him have the joy.\nBut I would like him to wait at least for the 6th of July, because I have a date with death. Whenever I die, I will die on the 6th of July. The year does not matter, but the 6th of July matters. I want it permanently to be the Master’s day. So, Mr. T., only this much favor you have to do for me.\nHe is trying to find ways, proper situations, spaces, places, from where he can assassinate me, and he is in much trouble. I am perfectly willing – after enlightenment what is there? All is fulfilled. I will be of every help to him. He could have approached me and asked, “How to assassinate you?” and I could have given him exactly the right information. I could have left my bedroom door open in the night... because I don’t want that man to suffer. After assassinating me, my sannyasins will not leave him to himself. He will be killed immediately, and I am against violence. But that is the trouble he is facing: everywhere there are thousands of sannyasins – he will be caught.\nI cannot even do what Jesus did on the cross. He prayed to God. There is no God, so I cannot pray.\nAnd he said to God, “Please forgive these people because they know not what they are doing.”\nThat too, I cannot say, because Mr. T. knows exactly what he is doing or planning to do. He just does not know how to do it. He seems to be an amateur. I feel sorry for him; perhaps he will not be able to do what he has come here for. I cannot interfere with him, I cannot interfere with my sannyasins. And my sannyasins also have guns. I don’t interfere with anybody.\nI have always been enlightened, but just thirty-two years ago I recognized it, just thirty-two years ago I became aware of it. And the same is going to happen to you too. Whenever you become awakened, you are in for a great surprise.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWOMEN HAVE A BETTER FEELING FOR OTHERS THAN MEN DO. HOW COME THERE HAVE BEEN NO GREAT MASTERS AMONG THEM SO FAR?\nIt is a very delicate question, and a little difficult too – about women everything is difficult – but I will try my best.\nFirst, you never ask why no man in the whole history of existence has been pregnant, why he has not given birth to a child. You simply know that biologically he has no womb. He can make many women pregnant. This has to be understood; that’s why there have been religions which allow four wives to a man, but no religion allows four husbands to a women, for the simple reason that a man can make many women pregnant. But once a woman is pregnant, then you can bring Muhammad Ali the Great – even he cannot do anything; for nine months the woman is booked.\nI know women have a much more feeling heart, are more loving, are more open, are more receptive. But these are the qualities of a disciple, not of a master. The disciple has to be open, receptive, vulnerable, loving, feeling. The only thing the disciple has to drop is his mind, not his heart. His mind is a constant disturbance. It goes on creating skepticism, and a disciple cannot be a skeptic.\nThe woman can be a prefect disciple, but cannot be a perfect master. Now, I am not responsible for it, I am simply saying what the fact is. And you can see it with your own eyes. I have more women disciples around the world than men, and I can trust women more than men. I have given every responsible job in all the communes around the world to women, not to men.\nYou must be surprised, because man has better reasoning, is more rational, is more authoritative, is more interested in being higher and higher in a hierarchy. The woman is not interested in hierarchy. Her interest in life is not through reasoning, but through feeling. Logic is not her world – love is her world.\nTo be a master is a very strange job. You have to convince people about the heart by argument and reason, rationality, philosophy; you have to use the mind as a servant for the heart. The master’s work is to take your mind away from you, so that your whole energy moves into your heart.\nIt is from the heart that we are connected with existence, it is not from the mind. Nobody can go directly from mind to existence.\nMind can create science, but it cannot create poetry, it cannot create paintings, it cannot create sculpture. And it is impossible for the mind to go into the dimension of religion. If the mind tries to go into the dimension of religion it creates theology, not religion.\nThe word “theology” has to be understood: theo means God, logy is logic – logic about God. Mind is capable of creating logic about God, arguments about God. God is not there, but through your argumentation, your reasoning, you can create a hypothetical God. All gods of all religions are hypotheses, and hypotheses which are absolutely unnecessary – not only unnecessary but dangerous, because if you get caught up in those hypothetical gods you are not going to ever find the authentic truth.\nHeart knows no argument; it feels. And existence has to be felt. Even when a man feels existence, he feels through the heart. But the heart cannot convince anybody.\nThe man has a tremendous capacity for logic and reason. Once he has found reality, enlightenment, through his heart, he can use the mind to spread the fragrance that he has found. The woman cannot do it. That’s why there have been not only no great masters, there have been no masters who were women. Even the famous religious women saints were disciples.\nSaint Teresa – I don’t mean Mother Teresa – Saint Meera, Saint Lalla... these three women were absolutely capable of becoming great masters, but the could not. They became enlightened, but they remained devotees.\nAnd there is nothing great in being a master; it is just a technical thing. The real thing is to realize your potential and your flowering.\nYour question is like: “Why in history has a woman never been a husband?” What can I do? A woman has to be a wife, and there is no suggestion that the husband is higher than the wife. In fact, just the opposite is the case.\nI have never come across any husband who is not henpecked. If you don’t want to become henpecked, then be a freelance lover, then never get married. Marriage simply means you have surrendered your freedom, your individuality – everything. Yes, when you go out of the house you go like a lion, roaring. But when you come back to the house you come like a rat, trembling. It is a strange thing.\nThis is a factual story I am going to tell you. Akbar, a great Mogul emperor in India – perhaps the greatest Mogul who has ruled India – was very curious about everything. One day he asked his council of wise people – he had collected nine of the most famous wise men around himself in his court – he asked them, “Can you find a husband who is not henpecked?”\nOnly one remained silent. He was the most wise; his name was Birbal. The other eight said, “Yes, we\ncan find many husbands, what to say about one?”\nAkbar looked at Birbal and he said, “You have not raised your hand.”\nHe said, “I cannot, because even you are a henpecked husband. You are a great emperor of a vast subcontinent, and I know the moment you enter your harem, you are nobody; the woman rules over you. These eight people don’t know the reality. First they should think about themselves. I would like to ask these eight people, ‘Are you henpecked or not?’ As far as I am concerned, I am. When I cannot remain free, I don’t believe these people are free. They have not pondered over it. But give them a chance – if they can find one, it will be a revelation.”\nThose eight wise men went to New Delhi, the capital of India, to look for a man who was not henpecked. Akbar gave them two horses, beautiful horses from Kabul, one pure white and one pure black. And he said, “Whoever you find that is not henpecked, you can give one of these two beautiful horses as a reward from me.”\nThey were really precious. In those days horses were something of a treasure; to have a beautiful, strong horse was a great joy. Now there are no more horses; there are cars which have horsepower.\nThose eight wise men went around the capital, and they were getting frustrated again and again, because they could not find one. The condition was: “If you say you are not henpecked, and it is proved not right, you will be hanged. If it is proved right, one of these two horses will be your reward.” There was nobody courageous enough to take the risk.\nOnly one man they found, who was a very strong man – seven feet tall, a great wrestler, a champion wrestler. He was sitting outside his house in the garden. His body was something to see; so solid that if he hit a man just with his fist, he could kill him. He looked like a man made of steel.\nThey thought, “Perhaps this man is the man we are searching for.” They asked him, “Are you henpecked?”\nHe said, “If you repeat it again, I will kill all of you. Me henpecked? Are you mad?”\nThey looked inside the house. A very small woman, very thin, was cooking food. The eight men said to the strong man, “Just to find out the facts – which horse would you like as a reward, the black or the white?”\nAnd the man turned back and asked his wife, “Muna’s mother” – that is the way in India it is done. You cannot take the name of the husband or the wife. The wife says, “Muna’s father,” the husband says, “Muna’s mother.” Muna is just like Tom, Dick, Harry. He asked, “Muna’s mother, should I take the white horse or the black?”\nMuna’s mother said, “If you take the black horse, I will give you hell! Take the white one.” And he told the wise people, “I would like to take the white one.”\nThey said, “You come with us – you don’t get either. You will be hanged!”\nIn the house, within the boundaries of the house, the woman has tremendous power. But she is not interested in the outside world. Women’s natures are different. A woman can become a great disciple, but for a woman to become a master is almost impossible. But there is no question of somebody being higher.\nThe master is not higher than the disciple. The master is simply trying to awaken you. The moment you are awakened there is no master and no disciple. It is just out of gratitude that the disciple remains a disciple – just out of gratitude. But there is no difference; they have known the same reality. They have become what nature wanted them to become, they have blossomed.\nSo don’t feel depressed that women have not been great masters – they have been great disciples.\nMan finds it difficult to become a disciple. In fact, man should worry about it, because to become a disciple is the real thing – and the beginning. And to come to the perfection of being a disciple is the end.\nA man passes through a very difficult phase. He cannot become a disciple, or can become one only in a wishy-washy way, always ready to quit. And without becoming a disciple, there is no question of becoming a master. Yes, once in a while it happens that a man becomes a master without becoming a disciple. But for that immense patience, a certain stubbornness, is needed.\nI don’t have any master. In my previous lives I never had any master. I have lived with many masters, I have known many masters, but I could not manage to become a disciple. That is why I am so late; otherwise, Jesus would not have preceded me. But it was simply difficult for me to be a disciple. I remained searching, and searching on my own. Yes, it took many many lives to arrive where I have always been.\nI have never been initiated by anyone. I am not a sannyasin. I am really outside of any crowd, and\nthat’s the way I have always been. It was a long, arduous journey to find that there is nothing to find.\nWomen are far more fortunate, because the beginning is in their hand, and the beginning is almost half the achievement. That I can see myself.\nThis was the basic reason why women could not become great masters. But there is no need to feel sad. They became great disciples – which is far more fortunate, because to begin from the beginning is easier than to begin from the end.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS COMMUNITY FOR A FEW YEARS. WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND? HOW CAN OUTSIDERS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SANNYASIN? HOW CAN WE SHOW WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT SANNYASINS?\nIt is not one question, there are many questions in it. First, this is not a community, it is a commune –\nand there is a vast difference between the two.\nChristianity is a community, Hinduism is a community. A community is a closed phenomenon. This is a commune, it is an open reality. Anybody can enter – anybody. I have not made any qualifications to be fulfilled before you become a sannyasin. And any moment you want to leave, it is absolutely acceptable; you are not condemned. You are received with love, and if you want to leave, you are given a goodbye with love. It is a very important thing to understand.\nIn existence nothing is closed, everything is open. In existence there is no noun to be found, everything is a verb. It is our language which has made great trouble.\nYou call a tree a tree, a river a river, but you are not aware that the tree is constantly growing; it is not dead, it is alive. In a better language it would be “treeing,” because it is growing. For a river a better word would be “rivering,” because it is flowing. Everything is a verb, always moving, growing, expanding, changing.\nA community is a dead thing. A commune is alive, growing, expanding, open – people coming in, going out.\nI am not offended when somebody leaves the commune; it is not my business. I never try to convert anybody to become a sannyasin. It was his desire to be a sannyasin, it is his desire to leave it. You cannot blame me. I remain completely a witness, like a mirror; things go on passing. When they are in front of the mirror, the mirror reflects them. When they go out, the mirror remains silent. It is not angry, it is not feeling that something has to be condemned.\nBut the people who have left the commune – they are not many – they only think they have left the commune, because I have not left them. Wherever they are, they are talking against me – here they were talking for me. In fact, here they may have forgotten me, may have taken me for granted; once they leave the commune, I am with them twenty-four hours a day. Whether you talk in favor of me or against me, you belong to me. Once a sannyasin you are always a sannyasin. You can drop the clothes, you can throw the mala, but you don’t know; it is impossible to be anything else again, you will remain a sannyasin.\nIn fact, that is the trouble for those few people who have left – mostly they are men; if a woman has left, she has left because of the man she loved. These people who have left the commune cannot mix with the outside world. If you have left me, forget all about me! They cannot forget me. Don’t forgive me, but please forget me! They cannot mix with the outside world, because I have deprogrammed them. When they are in church listening to an idiotic sermon, they will remember me, and they will be in favor of me inside their hearts.\nSo what do these people do? They start creating a small group. In America, in Santa Fe, there are a dozen sannyasins who have left. Now, why are they all in Santa Fe? That is my commune! They are just stupid people – why waste time on a man with whom you are no longer, from your side, in communion? Why waste your time? Those twelve people there in Santa Fe are continuously talking about me, against me.\nDo you understand the psychological phenomenon? They cannot get rid of me. If they are not in favor of me, then they are against me, but they cannot get rid of me.\nAnd why have they gathered together? Because in the outside world, who is going to listen to them talking against me – people who don’t know me? And they have gathered also because they cannot mix with the outside world. They cannot be again Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists. They were Rajneeshees, now they are anti-Rajneeshees. It makes no difference at all: they are my people. And in existence everything has its opposite as a complementary. These people are complementary Rajneeshees.\nA commune is a flowing phenomenon, a rivering, a treeing, a flowering. It is not a noun. So please don’t call my commune a community, it is not a community. A community is closed. A community depends on belief. A commune depends on communion. Here people are meeting heart to heart.\nYou have asked, “How to explain sannyas, sannyasins, this commune, to the outsiders?”\nIt is not possible. They will think you are crazy. The only way is to somehow trick them into coming here. It is something to be experienced, not explained. It is not a theory, it is something existent.\nJust think of a country where no flowers grow. Can you explain to those people what a flower is? They will laugh, they will say, “You must have hallucinated, you must have gone crazy. Trees never give flowers.” They will not understand the word “flower.” You will have to take them to where flowers exist. They can see with their own eyes, and they can smell with their own nostrils.\nI lived in India in a place, Jabalpur, for at least twenty years. Just thirteen miles outside Jabalpur is one of the most beautiful spots – perhaps the most beautiful in the whole world, something that seems to be not of this world. A great river, Narmada, flows between two mountains there. The mountains are not ordinary mountains, they are marble mountains. Just think of a white, marble mountain... for two miles on both sides, two marble mountains. The river flows just in between, and in the full moon night the mountains are reflected.\nI tried my best to explain to one of my teachers in the university who loved me very much – Dr. S.K. Satena. He had been a professor in America, in Hawaii, around the world; he was one of the foremost authorities on Indian philosophy. I tried hard to explain to him, but he said, “I have seen the\nwhole world – you cannot convince me. You have not seen the whole world, you cannot convince me that there is a spot which is the most beautiful in the whole world. I know the whole world, you have not traveled anywhere.”\nI said, “It is not a question of comparison. The moment you see the place You cannot conceive\nthat anything can be more beautiful.”\nI tortured him continuously. Finally he agreed, “Okay, I am coming with you.”\nOn a full moon night I took him there. For thirteen miles he was continually saying, “I don’t see anything here.” I remained silent. He said, “You are very articulate, very vocal. This is the first time I am seeing you silent, and I am continually saying that I don’t see anything.” But I remained silent. He said, “What has happened?”\nI said, “You just wait” – because those thirteen miles are ordinary. Beautiful road, surrounded with beautiful trees, but nothing special. I took him in a boat. For almost half a mile the mountains are not marble. He asked, “Is this the place?”\nI said, “Just wait. When the place comes I will not need to tell you, ‘This is it.’” After half a mile,\nsuddenly you enter into those marble rocks and the river, the deep river. I remained silent.\nHe said, “I am sorry. This is it.” He had tears in his eyes, because he had not listened to me for two\nyears. He said to me, “I might have died without seeing this place.”\nAs we went deeper the place became just something other-worldly, almost a dreamland. He said to me – he is a very logical man – he said, “Take the boat close to the rocks. I want to touch them and see whether they are there, or I am hallucinating, or you have given me some drug.”\nI had to take the boat close to the mountains. He touched them, he kissed them, and he said, “You\nneed not go around the world to find the most beautiful place. This is it.”\nThis is my answer to you. Don’t try to explain to anybody. This is an experience – or, in my language, an experiencing; the word “experience” again is dead. It is a continuous experiencing. Come again after one month and you will see the commune’s new colors, new faces, new dances, new songs. I am not a consistent man, neither are my people. I am consistent only as far as inconsistency is concerned. Whenever you come you will find an alive, breathing commune – new flowers, new dances, new songs.\nYou have to bring those people. If you tell them that this is a religion, they will think it must be like Christianity. And you know the inside of a church – gloomy, reminds you of death, a cross in front of you.… If you talk to a Christian, his experience of a church will come and disturb your explanation. What can you say? He will not believe that this is possible – a godless, a religionless religion? A religion that has no holy book? – because I call all holy books, holy shit!\nThere are far better books than your holy books. Don’t waste your time with reading THE BIBLE, the GITA, the KORAN. It is better to give the time to Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky; you will be immensely enriched by these people. Don’t be bothered with the Old Testament when I am giving you the Last Testament – unless you are an antique collector, that is a different matter.\nTruth is always fresh. It remains fresh only when it finds a master to speak it. You can write notes. Remember, those notes will not have the same quality, the same fragrance, the same truth – although the words will be the same as I am speaking.\nDo you know that no master ever wrote a book in the whole history of humanity? Can it be just a coincidence? No, it is not a coincidence. No master ever wrote a single book, for the simple reason that the moment the word is written it is dead, it is a corpse. The word has to be alive. It has to come from the heart, it has to beat. Only then can it reach to your heart.\nOnly heart can commune with heart.\nBring those people here. There is no other way of explaining what is happening; otherwise, you will become a laughingstock. This is a very dangerous game. Truth cannot be explained, it cannot be described. But truth can be tasted.\nI remember, a missionary had gone to the cannibals in Africa. He was the first Christian missionary who had dared to go to the cannibals to convert them to Christianity.\nCannibals are the most difficult people to convert. They have not even dropped eating man, they have eaten their own people. In the beginning – the beginning of this century– there were thousands of cannibals in Africa. There are only three hundred left, because if you cannot get your food from outside, you eat your children, you eat your old men – what else to do? Their number goes on decreasing; they will disappear. Perhaps the last cannibal will have to eat himself.\nBut the missionary was a fanatic. And just the way Jesus believed that God would save him from the cross, a miracle would happen.… And nothing happened. It was such a disappointment to thousands of people who had come to see the miracle. It was a greater disappointment to Jesus himself.\nHe looked again and again upwards – as if God is sitting on the roof of Rajneesh Mandir. He called, prayed – no answer, no miracle. Not even an angel playing on the harp, coming down on a cloud – nothing stirred. Slowly people started going away, thinking that it was just a waste of time, the whole day wasted in the heat.\nThis Christian bishop was also just as fanatical as Jesus Christ. He said, “The Lord is with me. What can the cannibals do to me?” But the cannibals did what they wanted to do. It is strange, this God of your is very strange. He was not with the priest, he was with the cannibals; he was not with Jesus Christ, he was with Barabbas.\nWhen Pontius Pilate asked It was a ritual that if the people demanded it, then one person could be\nfreed from being crucified. Three persons were being crucified that day. One was Jesus Christ, who was utterly innocent, simple – more exactly, a simpleton. Pontius Pilate was thinking that people would ask for Jesus, because the other two were confirmed criminals; Barabbas had committed many murders. And the people asked for Barabbas to be released!\nGod’s miracle was happening to Barabbas, not to Jesus – and not just one time. Because Barabbas was accustomed to murder, he did not care about crucifixion or anything, so even though he was\nforgiven In fact, Barabbas was resurrected, not Jesus Christ. From the cross he was brought\ndown; he was reborn, not Jesus Christ. God! Perhaps this was the miracle!\nWithin three months Barabbas was caught again, because he had murdered, in three months, three people. But the law was, once a man is given freedom from the death sentence by the Roman emperor, then he can never be crucified again. So now they could not crucify him for his murders; they had to find a substitute. They sent him to Sicily to work in a coal mine for his whole life. And you will be surprised: the coal mine collapsed, all other prisoners – there were thousands – died, and Barabbas was saved!\nAnd you think Jesus is saved? And these fanatic Christians are trying to save others.\nA miracle did happen: thousands of people died and Barabbas was the only one who was saved. Even the emperor of Rome was impressed; twice the man had been saved. Barabbas was called to Rome for their annual festival, where they brought their criminals to fight with lions. And you will not believe me: Barabbas was again saved. He killed the lion!\nEven the emperor called him close and touched him; he seemed to be the very representative of God. He gave him not only freedom but first-class citizenship – because slaves are second-class people, and Barabbas was a slave, sentenced for his whole life. The emperor freed him. This God seems to be crazy. This whole idea is nothing but imagination, projection.\nThe fanatical missionary was caught immediately by the cannibals. He said to them, “Have you ever tasted Christianity?”\nThey said, “Wait. Just within an hourLook at that pot.” There was a pot, a big pot boiling.\nThe missionary could not understand. He said, “What do you mean?”\nThey said, “We will put you in that boiling pot and make a soup of you, and then we will taste\nChristianity for the first time. Everybody is so eager to taste Christianity.”\nI think those barbarians were right: religion is something to be tasted, not explained. Bring those people here. We are not barbarians, we are vegetarians.\nOnly in this milieu can you help your friends to understand what sannyas is all about, and what this commune is.\nYou are asking me if there is something special about a sannyasin that you can tell to your people. Yes, there is. A sannyasin is extraordinarily ordinary. He has no claims to any superiority. Not only in regard to human beings, he is in tune with trees and birds and rivers and clouds, and he claims no superiority even to animals and trees and rocks. We are all part of one cosmos. But please don’t try logically, rationally to explain this to them. This is not a theology that I am giving to you.\nThis is a taste, this is an experiencing. This is love, not logic.\nBut why are you concerned to explain to those outsiders? As far as I can tell, you are still not a sannyasin, because a sannyasin would not ask such a question. If you really want to help people to understand the tremendous phenomenon that is happening here, the first step should be: become a sannyasin. Of course, you will be thought mad. So what? In a mad world, to be thought mad means you are the only sane person.\nBecome sane. That is the meaning of becoming a sannyasin. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSHOULD WE TAKE YOUR ADVICE NOT TO TAKE ANYONE’S ADVICE?\nAdvice is the only thing in the world which everybody gives and nobody takes.\nYou can ask me a question, but you cannot ask for advice; I am not that foolish. I will never give you any advice, because who am I to give you advice? You are unique, every individual is unique. My advice will be my experience. That may distract you from your own life, that may take you away from your own being. I have never advised anyone.\nYes, you can ask a question. The answer that I give only has to be understood, it has not to be accepted on my authority. You have to be just a listener to it, without any prejudice. My answer, listened to without any prejudice, will become a totally different thing in you; it will be molded by your being. Then it is no longer mine; it is yours.\nThat’s the function of a master – not to create followers, but to create masters.\nI am not saying anything to be believed. I am saying, just give me a little understanding, try to understand what I am saying to you. Listen – and it will take a different shape, a different form, a different aura within you. It will not be the same that was said, because words are empty.\nWhen the words are in my heart they are full. The moment they leave my lips, the content is left behind; only the container reaches you. But if you allow the container to enter you, it will reach your heart – because it is coming from the heart – and your heart will fill it with its own content. Then it is yours, it has nothing to do with me.\nYou cannot blame me; whatever happens to you, it is your responsibility. I just like talking – I don’t take any responsibility. Why should I take anybody’s responsibility? I like talking, you like listening – good! So far, so good.\nBut understand the whole alchemy of listening: listening rightly, you will have your own understanding flowering. You will not be dependent on me, you will not be my follower. You will be yourself.\nYou are asking for advice. I don’t give any advice. And I say to you, don’t ask anyone for advice\neither. You ask advice only because you are not courageous enough to experience on your own.\nThe moment you ask for advice, you become a slave. And if you follow it, you have committed suicide.\nI don’t want you to commit suicide. I want you to grow higher and higher into life, into love, into light.\nCHAPTER 8\nWith me begins a new era of enlightenment\n5 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY HAVEN’T OTHER ENLIGHTENED MASTERS TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD, JESUS,\nHEAVEN AND HELL?\nThe phenomenon of enlightenment is very rare. It should not be so, because everyone is born enlightened and then enters into a dark tunnel of religions, cultures, civilizations, education. Enlightened you are born, unenlightened you die. That’s why I say it should not be so rare.\nIt should be just the contrary; most of the people should be enlightened, to find unenlightened people\nshould be difficult. But that’s not what has been happening down the ages.\nThe society is not interested in enlightened people. They are dangerous, contagious. They cannot be enslaved – and all societies want people to be enslaved, exploited, oppressed.\nThe enlightened person is rebellious, against all that man has been doing to other human beings. That’s why all the societies from the very beginning start closing the doors and the windows from where any light can enter the child. They will start making him a Christian. Now, no Christian can be enlightened. He will have to drop his Christianity before he becomes enlightened. The same is true about Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, communism, fascism.\nThe enlightened person has no “ism.” He need not be concerned with any ideology. He has his own\neyes open, he can see; he need not think. Only a blind man thinks about where the door is to get\nout, where the road is to move on. Only a blind man waits for someone to help him to cross the road. Only a blind man needs a guide, a master; if you have eyes, you cross the road yourself, you find the door yourself. In fact, there is no question of finding: you don’t even think about it, you see it.\nPlease understand the difference between seeing and thinking. Thinking is a very poor substitute for seeing. If you have not seen a lotus flower, howsoever you think about it, you will not be able to figure out what a lotus flower is. The moment you see it, thinking stops. There is nothing to think about; the thing itself is in front of you. And a lotus flower is so beautiful that it is bound to stop your thinking process at least for a second. Only in that second will you experience the beauty, the grandeur, the godliness of the flower.\nThe world is divided into civilizations, societies, cultures. They all do the same thing to the visitors coming into the world, the new people – the children. Mankind has committed the greatest crime against its own children. The children are dependent on you, they think you know all – and you know perfectly well that you know nothing.\nThe children are very curious about each and every thing. They are continuously asking, their enquiry is constant. You try to shut them up – not because their questions are irrelevant, but because you don’t have answers. And you know perfectly well that by the time they reach your age, they will understand the situation – and they will do the same with their own children. This goes on and on, generation to generation; hence very rarely have there been enlightened people.\nOf the people who are known as enlightened, at least eighty percent are just bogus. How can they criticize God, Jesus, heaven and hell? In fact, they are accepted as enlightened because they accept Jesus as the son of God. They are accepted as enlightened because they go on telling people they have seen God, met God, talked with him; he has sent messages through them to you. How can they criticize God? That is their foundation. How can they criticize heaven and hell? Their whole enlightenment, saintliness, wisdom, depends on these fictions. Destroying them, they will destroy themselves.\nHence, eighty percent of your so-called enlightened people are more unenlightened than you are. But it is a strange world. The blind go on leading other blind. Of course, finally they all fall in a ditch someway or other. But the other blind far away in the line don’t know that the leader and the close followers have fallen in a ditch and disappeared.\nI cannot accept anything that is not my own experience. I have enquired without any investment. I do not want to be worshipped; hence, I am not dependent on you. I do not want to become a God to you; hence I am absolutely free to say what is the truth.\nEighty percent of enlightened people have been either Christians or Hindus or Mohammedans or Buddhists. To me this is something of a fundamental contradiction. A man is enlightened and is still a Mohammedan? Then what is the difference between blind people and enlightened people? At least he should renounce Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Christianity. He should simply say, “I am myself. I am not a sheep, and I don’t need any shepherd. I am a man of my own consciousness, and I have a light of my own. I don’t need THE BIBLE to guide me, or the VEDAS to be my vision. I have my own vision.”\nAn enlightened person cannot belong to any religion. He belongs to existence. So you can cut off eighty percent of your enlightened people without any difficulty.\nTen percent of enlightened people remain silent. You never come to know about them, for the simple reason that you cannot understand silence. And to be enlightened is one thing; to give it an expression is totally different. And unless the enlightened person starts expressing his vision, his experience, his realization, how are you going to know about him?\nWhy do ten percent choose to remain silent? It is because to be articulate is a different quality, it does not come in the same parcel as enlightenment. You don’t expect an enlightened man to be a painter necessarily. You don’t expect him to be a poet necessarily. Why should you expect that he will be able to be articulate with words? And it is a very difficult job. Perhaps the hardest job in the world is to tell you about something you know nothing about.\nEven Gautam Buddha remained silent for seven days after his enlightenment, thinking, “What is the point? First, I cannot say what I have seen; there are no words for it. Words are impotent and the experience is so immense, so vast.…\n“Words are so small, they are for day-to-day use. They are not made by enlightened people, they are made by blind people living in darkness. Those words have connotations of ignorance. Now, to express light through those words is almost impossible.”\n“Secondly,” Buddha thought, “even if I speak, manage somehow to deliver the message, who is going to listen?”\nPeople are interested in money, in power, in politics, in becoming bigger and bigger, higher and higher compared to others. Who is really interested in enlightenment? It is just an accident if you come across a man who is enlightened and get infected. The thing is contagious, and there is no way of preventing it – and no antidote.\nSo Buddha said, “Even if I speak, people are not going to listen. Perhaps they may hear, but hearing\nand listening are totally different things.”\nWhen I am speaking even buffaloes are hearing, donkeys are hearing, but they are not listening. Hearing is a simple thing; you have ears, that’s all, nothing else is needed. The buffalo will go on chewing the grass – and you will go on talking about enlightenment. And man is not much different; in fact he is worse, because the buffalo at least has no rush of thoughts in her mind. She is a simple being, just chewing grass, enjoying the morning sun, the cool air – tremendously happy.\nHave you seen any buffalo laughing? You must think that buffaloes don’t laugh because they are in tremendous misery. You are wrong. You laugh because you are in tremendous misery. You need the laughter just to keep you going.\nJews have the most beautiful jokes in the world, because they have suffered the most in world. Strange... I have been searching my whole life for a single Indian joke – I have not found one.\nThey have lived peacefully. India has never invaded any country, has never been aggressive, violent, has had no desire to become bigger and bigger, huge; India has never been imperialistic. It has\nbeen invaded by many people, and for two thousand years it has been a slave country under Hunas, Turks, Moguls, British people, Portuguese people, French, you just say the name – and India has been invaded by everybody.\nAnd why did such a vast country, almost a continent, yield so easily? They were not interested in fighting. Small groups of people... what is England? – not bigger than a district in India. What is its population? If all the Indians had pissed simultaneously, England would have drowned. No atom bombs would be needed!\nI have heard that when for the first time the Americans reached the moon, walked on the moon, they were surprised: a few Indians were sitting there. They could not believe their eyes! They were singing their bhajanas – “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.” The Americans thought, “My God! We have been putting so much energy, science, money into reaching the moon – how have these idiots managed?”\nThey asked the Indians. The Indians said, “It is not difficult. We just started standing upon each other’s shoulders, and finally we reached.”\nIndia is a huge and vast country. Eight hundred million people... eighty hundred million people... no... You guess how many! They can reach the moon without any trouble, just standing upon each other. And small groups of Turks and Moguls defeated them!\nThis is not history; actually India has never been defeated by anybody. India simply allowed anybody to invade – they welcomed them! The country was peaceful, there was enough food, enough space – what did it matter if a few more people were absorbed? There was so much to be shared. These peaceful people, without any desire to be aggressive, remained slaves for two thousand years, for the simple reason that they were not interested in fighting.\nAre you interested in meditation, in enlightenment? You have heard the word, but listening to the\nword “enlightenment,” does anything stir in your heart?\nBuddha thought, “Whom am I going to teach? In the first place teaching is difficult. In the second place to find a disciple is difficult.” And he thought, “Even if I can manage to convey something of my experience, and I can also find some disciples who cannot only hear, but listen too”\nListening means hearing without thinking.\nThe prerequisite for listening is that you put your mind aside, so you are just a pure space. It does not mean believing; you need not believe what you listen to. But unless you listen, how can you decide whether it is true or untrue? And a fundamental law of life is: if you listen without thinking, you will be able to see whether it is true or not. There will not be any need for you to think logically, to balance this way and that, to argue for and against.\nArguing does not help. Can a blind man argue whether light exists or not? And you have eyes – have you ever argued whether light exists or not? Seeing is enough – you know! In the same way, listening is enough. An immediate understanding arises.\nFor seven days Buddha pondered over the matter, and decided that it was useless. And the final day, when he decided not to speak, his thought was, “Many masters have existed, and what has happened? People go on living the same way, doing everything the same way.” In fact, things go on becoming worse. If there had been no Mohammed, thousands of wars would have been avoided. If there had been no Jesus Christ, the world would be much more at ease and at peace – because Christians have been killing, Mohammedans have been killing.\nBuddha’s insight was that first, to bring the experience down to the level of language evolved by blind people, some kind of braille-ish language is needed. Then to find disciples, then to teach them to hear rightly – that is, to listen.…\n“And if a man is capable of all this,” Buddha thought, “even without me, sooner or later he will become\nenlightened. It may take a little more time, but that does not matter in the eternity of time.”\nThe story is beautiful In Buddhism it is said that gods came, after waiting seven days for Buddha to\nspeak. In Buddhism there is no God, but there are gods. And gods are not creators of the world. They are just people like you who have earned so much virtue in their past life that they are given a holiday period in paradise. As they spend their virtue, they have to come back to the earth again, back into the misery, the suffering. Yes, they enjoyed the weekend in heaven Those people are\ncalled gods in Buddhism.\nThe gods became very much afraid, because they were waiting for Buddha to speak. If they can understand Buddha, then there will be no need for them to end the weekend. If they can understand him and become enlightened, then there is no need to come back into the world of suffering, misery, pain, anguish, anxiety – gods are not superior to enlightened people in Buddhism.\nSo seven gods, representing all the other gods, came down on the seventh day when Buddha had decided not to speak, and persuaded him, “All your arguments are right, but there may be just a few people who are on the margin, just on the borderline, a little push and they may jump into a new existence. And we have waited for a man of enlightenment for thousands of years; now you have become enlightened and you are not going to speak! One enlightened man in thousands of years, and he is not going to speak, he is not going to be of any help to anybody.”\nI am telling this story to make it clear to you that ten percent of buddhas, enlightened people – that is the meaning of buddha – have remained silent.\nThey have achieved, they have known, they have arrived home, and the experience and the ecstasy is so tremendous – who has time, or energy, or inclination to go back on the county roads to find disciples?\nNine percent of buddhas have spoken, but they have not criticized Jesus, God, heaven, hell, or anything, for the simple reason that they were aware of the fact that it is very difficult to attract people to your vision, and if you start hitting them.… A Christian comes and you speak against Jesus – rather than changing the man’s enquiry into a deep intimacy, you create an enemy.\nOnly one percent of enlightened people have tried that. And I am the one percent – because I am not interested in any bullshit. I am not interested in increasing my numbers, I am not a politician. I don’t care a bit about more and more people becoming sannyasins.\nThere are six hundred million Catholics. So what? – just labels. I don’t want to put a label on you. And I want to say that the ninety-nine percent of enlightened people in the past – whether they have spoken, remained silent, or were bogus themselves – have failed.\nA new humanity has to emerge. It has to begin with a new kind of enlightened man; there is no other way. The new enlightened man heralds the beginning of a new history, a New Man, a new hope, a new future.\nI will criticize everything that hinders, that prevents you from knowing your self-nature. I will hit you hard. If you escape, that is your problem. If you are strong enough, and you go on being with me, soon it will be possible to drop all the crap – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan... crap is crap; it is very sticky.\nAnd forgive me, because I have to bring you to that purity in which you were born – in that beautiful, utter nudity, when you were just yourself; nobody had manipulated you, you were innocent.\nAll the cultures and religions have used your innocence, have treated it as ignorance. It was not ignorance; it was not knowledge either. To be ignorant you have to be a little knowledgeable – of course, in a wrong way, upside down. The innocent person is totally different from the knowledgeable and the ignorant. The child is innocent, not ignorant.\nI want to offer you back your innocence. But much garbage has to be moved out of the way. You are carrying all kinds of rubbish around with you; you have become identified with it – that’s why I have to use hammers!\nI will expose the bogus enlightened people. I will criticize those who remained silent – they were not people of compassion. Even if nobody listens to you, it does not mean that you can excuse yourself. If the sun rises and no flower blooms, do you think the sun will stop rising? “What is the point? No bird sings, no flower blossoms” – no, the sun will go on rising.\nTo me, to experience the ultimate automatically brings a tremendous urge to share it. If you reject it, that is your problem. Passing by a rosebush with beautiful fragrance, if you close your nostrils, hold your nose with your hand, what can the rose do? But it does not mean that roses should stop blossoming. A rose blossoms out of its own realization. If somebody is thrilled by its fragrance, good. If nobody even comes around it there is no harm, the rose has done its work.\nI cannot forgive those people who remained silent. Even if they were not articulate, they should have tried at least. If they could attain to the ultimate they were people of great intelligence, they could devise methods and ways. Listening to me, you know I go on devising methods for meditation.\nIn fact, there is no method for meditation. All the methods that I use are for a different purpose: to prepare you for meditation. Those methods are not meditation themselves, they simply prepare you, they bring you to the very bank of the river and leave you there. Now it is up to you to jump and have the joy of the running water and the coolness and the swim, or to remain stuck on the bank like a lamppost. That is up to you.\nBut I cannot forgive those people who remained silent. They were selfish, utterly selfish, more selfish than those people who go on accumulating power, money, and all kinds of things of the\nworld. They are nothing, because what they are accumulating is junk. But the man who has known enlightenment and keeps it to himself, he cannot be forgiven. I am going to condemn those people.\nAnd the people who have spoken – the nine percent – I have to show you how many of them are only using borrowed knowledge. I don’t think Jesus is enlightened, he is simply quoting the Old Testament. Here and there he tries to improve on it, but it is not his own experience. He is trying to prove to his people that he is the only begotten son of God.\nJust the other day I was talking about Barabbas to you. When I put Jesus Christ and Barabbas side by side, I think Barabbas looks... he was a son of a bitch, but he looks as if he is the only begotten son of God: three times he returned from death. Jesus does not look enlightened.\nAn enlightened person cannot claim such egoistic things – that he is the only begotten son of God, that he is the messenger, the latest messenger, that his word is law, that those who follow him, their paradise is guaranteed and those who are not going to follow him At the day of judgment, the last\njudgment, he will sort out people. His people will go to paradise and the remaining ones will fall into the abysmal darkness of hell.\nSometimes I have been wondering: on the last judgment day, how many people will be there? The\nwhole historybillions, trillions and trillions. Perhaps mathematics hasn’t a number for them.\nMathematics was born in India. Only in Indian mathematics are there numbers which can manage even the last judgment day. No other language has words for such large numbers. The largest number in Indian mathematics is mahashankh. Shankh means that which can be measured, counted. Mahashank means not countable.\nMahashankh people will be there on the last judgment day. And remember, half of them will be women chattering, fighting. It is going to be a very difficult day, because a man may have been a\nhusband to millions of women, a woman may have been a wife to millions of men – so many lives! There is going to be so much shouting and fighting – I don’t think God will be able to manage judgment. And Jesus Christ says he will sort out his people. Forget it, boy, it is impossible!\nAnd Jesus was not a great mathematician either. He must have used his fingers to count, because he was an uneducated man. Uneducated people count on their fingers. That’s why in every language ten digits are the basic digits, because there are ten fingers; mathematics was born out of counting on the fingers. There are only that many real numbers; other numbers are just additions and repetitions of those ten, again and again.\nI don’t see any statement of Jesus which proves enlightenment. He talks about prayer, but not about meditation – and without meditation there is no way towards enlightenment. Prayer is a childish thing. You don’t know God. To whom are you praying? You don’t know the language that God understands. In what language are you praying?\nI don’t think that God could understand all the languages. Three hundred languages exist just on this earth, and there are fifty thousand planets where life exists, so there will be millions of languages. God must have gone crazy by now – listening to all these prayers, and consulting the dictionaries.…\nAnd how can pray when you don’t know God? It is mad! Your God is a belief. Jesus has given you a system of beliefs, he has given you a faith.\nAn enlightened man gives you a science, not a faith. Belief or faith means you simply have to accept something without knowing it. A man of integrity will simply reject it. He will say, “Unless I know it, how can I trust?” All the religions ask you to believe, and you have never enquired what belief means.\nBelief means preventing you from enquiry into truth. You already believe there is a God – then there is no need to enquire. Science has progressed because it is not based on beliefs. All religions are retarded. There has been no progress in any religion – cannot be, you have cut the very roots.\nFaith is not needed, but an enquiring mind. But no religion supports enquiry; they are afraid of it. If they have the truth, why should they be afraid of enquiry? They don’t have the truth. They have invented a God. They may say, “God created man in his own image” – the reality is just the opposite: man has been creating God in his own image. That’s why there are so may gods around the world.\nA Hindu God cannot have a Jewish nose, that is inconceivable. A Mohammedan God cannot be conceived by the Jainas. A Mohammedan God says, “Convert people to Mohammedanism by the strength of the sword.” Mohammedanism is not argumentative, it knows nothing of logic or rationality; it believes in the sword. Its argument is the sword.\nNow, somebody puts a sword on your neck, and says, “Either be converted to Mohammedanism or be ready to die” – because Mohammedanism believes even if you kill a person because he was resisting conversion to Mohammedanism, you will both be rewarded.\nYou will be rewarded because you tried your hardest – certainly you did! And the other will also be rewarded because if he had been left to live without being converted to Mohammedanism, he might have committed many sins and would have suffered in hell. Now he is dead, and the dead don’t commit sins. You have released that man from the opportunity to fall into hell. And if you die fighting, you will reach paradise.\nJainism cannot conceive of such a God, such a religion. Their religion says that even if you kill an ant, you will suffer in hell. Now, I don’t see that anybody can can be anywhere else than in hell. Whatsoever you do, you will be killing millions of live things every day! Your whole body system continuously goes on changing: dead cells are thrown out of the body, new cells go on coming in. According to Jainism, just to live is to commit a sin.\nTo breathe is to commit a sin, because your breath exhaled is hot, and in the air there are millions of small living cells moving around you. That much heat is enough to kill them. Even to breathe is enough to send you to hell. You are not killing anybody knowingly.\nThe Jaina prophet, Mahavira, slept in the night only on one side. He would not change sides, because if you change sides you will be killing more small living beings. Just remaining exactly in one posture the whole night.… I cannot conceive of him being enlightened. Just think, even in the night you cannot relax. Just keeping one posture the whole night, can you relax? Such an unrelaxed man cannot be called enlightened.\nI am going to tell you the truth. If it hurts, that is your problem.\nAnd I am not asking anything from you – that’s why I don’t care whether it hurts you or not. I am not the only begotten son of God, so I don’t depend on you. I don’t claim to be the messenger of God, I don’t claim to be a prophet; all these people are unknowingly becoming dependent on you. They are becoming slaves to you. If all the Jews leave Moses, his prophethood is gone. Who is going to call him a prophet? If all the Christians drop Jesus completely, who is going to make him the only begotten son of God?\nI don’t depend on anybody, I am simply myself. For that I don’t need anybody’s consent, belief, faith. I don’t need anybody to nourish my ego. And anybody who is trying to be nourished by others, particularly for his ego, is not enlightened.\nThe enlightened man has no ego at all. He is simply without any “I”. I have to use the word, but there is no corresponding reality in me. The word “I” is just a linguistic device – it has no reality.\nWhether you listen to me or not makes no difference. I am not saying believe in me, because what I know you can know; there is no need for any belief. All beliefs are anti-religious, anti-spiritual. All belief systems have to be dropped, only then can man be at peace. These belief systems are keeping you fighting each other, destroying each other. They don’t give you even a chance to discover yourself.\nGetting rid of all belief systems is liberation. For that liberation I am criticizing people like Jesus or Mohammed or Mahavira, and I am criticizing their strategies to exploit you: heaven and hell. Through heaven they create fear in you, and greed. Through hell the same thing, fear and greed. Fear and greed are poisons, but they are saying, “Those who believe and believe totally”\nThey are asking something impossible. That’s why you are all tense, because you cannot manage it. How can you believe, and believe totally, something you know nothing about? They are not even saying to you, “Believe only hypothetically.” They are asking you, “Believe totally.” How can you believe? Deep down you know you don’t know. Deep down you are repressing your disbelief.\nAll believers are underground unbelievers. Underground, all Christians are continuously suffering, because by their belief they have created a division, a split in their being. The belief says Jesus is born out of a virgin girl! And they believe it, out of the greed for heaven – for enjoying the beauties of heaven for eternity – and the fear of falling into the depths of hell. And the Christian hell is the worst – avoid it! If you want to fall into hell, fall into any other, because every other hell has a time limit; the Christian hell is for eternity.\nThese religions are living on your fear and greed. I have to destroy your fear and your greed, because they are preventing you from seeing your reality, seeing your eternal being, your immortality. I have to go on hitting on the head of your so-called God, because if God is there then man can never be liberated. God is another name of eternal imprisonment.\nIf God can create, just out of his whim – because there seems to be no excuse for creating the world Why did he create the world? And just four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ\nwas born? What was he doing before that? For eternity, going backwards, he has not done anything. What prompted him to create the world four thousand and four years before Jesus was born?\nNo explanation is given by Christian theologians, because there is no explanation. If they give any explanation, that means God can be forced to do something. If they say that God created the world because he loved to create, where was this love to create for the whole eternity? And suddenly one day...? There must be some reason. No Christian theologian in two thousand years has been able to say what prompted God to create the world – and this world.\nAnd if God is whimsical – that is the only possibility; he is whimsical, eccentric, a little off the track; in short, just a nut – if he created this world, why did he create heaven and hell? If he enjoyed creating, he could have created you without all that which can lead you to hell. If he can create this whole immense world, can’t he create a man without sex, without anger, without jealousy, without greed, without fear, without death? He seems to be a very cruel type of God, very unkind.\nAnd then he creates the priests who preach to you, “Be celibate.” Some great conspiracy is going on. God creates you as a sexual being, and his priest – who is infallible, the pope – teaches you to remain celibate. Have you ever asked, “Is the pope against God?” He must be, because God creates love in you, God creates anger in you, and the pope says you have to drop all this. To whom are you going to listen? To God? Or to this Polack pope? And this is the situation of all religions.\nI am telling you, listen to nature and just be natural. Sex is beautiful because it is natural. And a tremendous transformation happens when you accept your naturalness. When you accept everything that you are, there is a transformation, because a new thing has arisen in you: acceptance – which all the priests of all the religions have been destroying.\nThey destroy your acceptance of yourself, they create guilt in you. That is something of an ultimate crime – to create guilt. And the easiest way is to teach you to go against your own nature.\nYou cannot go against nature. Who will go against it?\nYou are nature.\nSo all these monasteries of Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists are full of hypocrites; there is not a single man worthy of any respect. And these religions have created all kinds of perversions in the world. When you suppress your sex, it starts flowing in unnatural ways. You cannot stop nature, it will find some other way. If you keep men and women apart you will be responsible for creating homosexuality.\nWhen I was a lecturer in the university, the first thing I did In India the girls and the boys cannot sit\ntogether in the class. The girls sit on one side, the boys sit on the other side, and a space is left\nbetween them. The first day I entered the university I said, “Get mixed up.”\nThey were very much puzzled, nervous. They said, “But we have been told to remain separate.”\nI said, “This is my class, and nature has not told you to be separate. Nature has managed in every way to bring you closer. I am not against nature – just get mixed up.\n“And you know, when a girl is not pinched by a boy, how much she suffers. I don’t want any suffering here. You can sit mixed up, you can hold hands. I want you to be relaxed, because then you can hear me better; otherwise I am wasting my time here. You are throwing your letters to the girls and girls are throwing letters to you – I cannot tolerate this nonsense.”\nOf course, the vice-chancellor was very disturbed when he came to know. He called me and asked,\n“What are you doing?”\nI said, “I want you just to remember your own student days.” He said, “But what has that to do with it?”\nI said, “It has everything to do with it. Were you not hankering to be closer to the girls? Tell me the\ntruth!”\nHe said, “You just go and do whatever you want.”\nIt is absolutely natural that boys will write letters and follow girls, and girls will try to escape. This is just a natural game. The girl does not want to escape! You just stop chasing her and she will start chasing you.\nThat is continuously happening in my commune. No man is chasing women, the women are chasing men, because the number of men is less, and the number of women is more. And it is perfectly natural – the girl escaping from the boy is simply becoming more attractive to him, becoming a challenge to him.\nYou will never be interested in a woman who is chasing you, if you are a man, because she is not a challenge. Man loves challenge; it is a hide-and-seek game. But it is natural, and whatever is natural is virtue; whatever is unnatural is criminal.\nAnd I can say all these things to you because I don’t claim any extraordinariness about myself. I am a simple, ordinary, natural human being. Perhaps this is the first time any enlightened man has had the courage to say that he is just ordinary, simple, natural.\nIf you understand me, what I am saying I am saying, with me begins a new era in enlightenment.\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU, AND I FEEL THE ANSWERS WITHIN ME TOO. BUT THE ANSWERS THAT I FEEL DO NOT HELP ME. WHY IS IT SO?\nBecause they are not answers! Are you stupid or something? If they don’t help you, and the question\nremains, you have some nerve to call them answers. Forget those answers, they are not.\nThe moment you find the answer to your question, the question dissolves, the problem disappears. This is the criterion to judge whether it was an answer or not.\nBut the man who has asked the question must be very egoistic. He says, “I have many questions that I want to ask; I have my own answers but they don’t help.” They will never help. Please ask your questions.\nAnd you cannot have many questions either. That is an exaggeration. These are the ways of the ego:\n“I have many questions, and I also have all the answers.”\nBut the ego is just like a balloon: if you go on filling it with air, there comes a moment when it bursts. Today, that moment has come.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM HAPPY TO BE FREE FROM ANY GOD, AND TO BE LIVING MORE AND MORE ON MY OWN AUTHORITY. BUT NOW I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS ALL ABOUT. ISN’T IT JUST ANOTHER GOD?\nIt seems to be the same stupid man. How do you know that there is no God – because I have said it? But when did I say it to you, “Believe in me”?\nYou must be enjoying great egoism: “I am free of God.” You are not free even of your ego, how can you be free of God? How do you manage to know that there is no God? One can know this only after enlightenment, because then the whole existence is crystal-clear, open; life is there, but there is no God anywhere.\nBecause you started with a belief – hearing me say again and again that there is no God – you felt good, because if there is no God then you are free to do anything. When I am saying there is no God, I am not freeing you from responsibility. In fact, when there is no God you become totally responsible for every act. If there is a God you can commit a sin and then just go and confess to the priest, and you are forgiven. But if there is no God, nobody can forgive you; you will have to undo what you have done. Your responsibility is tremendous. You cannot pray for any help – no help will be coming.\nThe religions have kept man in this idiotic situation because on the one hand they say, “Don’t do this” – and they know perfectly well you will do it, it is natural. Then they give you the medicine for it: you can confess. Or you can go to a holy river and take a dip in it and all your sins will be washed away. Or chant a mantra every day, do transcendental meditation – which is neither transcendental nor meditation – and you will always be clean, forgiven.\nGod is looking after you, he is holding your hand in his hand. All this has kept you crippled; you have not been able to walk on your own feet. And you have not been able to see what you are doing, why you are doing it. Is it right? Is it confirmed by your consciousness, your awareness?\nA man of awareness never repents, because a man of awareness does only things that can done with full consciousness. But Jesus goes on telling Christians, “Repent! Repent! The day of judgment is coming soon.” He does not teach people a life of non-repentance – and that’s what I teach you.\nBe alert, be conscious. Don’t go against nature. Don’t try to swim against the current, go with the river. Be in a let-go. Accept anything that arises naturally in you. And you will not need any repentance, any prayer, any God.\nYou say you are freed from God and you are enjoying it. You are enjoying only a licentiousness; it is not freedom. Freedom is responsibility.\nA slave need not be responsible, his master is responsible. In fact, I say to all the religions of the world, “You need not be worried. When you face God tell him, ‘It is you who created us in this way, with these instincts. We are not responsible. Why should we repent, and why should we pray? You should repent for this creation, and you should ask forgiveness from us. This is a day of judgment!’”\nBut you don’t know that there is no God. You are not freed from God, you just have another belief.\nAnd I go on saying to you: Don’t believe in me!\nI am not creating a faith.\nI am giving you a science.\nEnquire, search – and find. If you had found that there is no God, then your question would not be there: “What about enlightenment?” That would have happened before. You could not have asked, “Is not enlightenment another God?” because you would have known yourself that enlightenment is not a god, but it is absolute godliness. And remember the difference: God is a person, godliness is a quality.\nGodliness is the fragrance of the man who has attained enlightenment. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SAYTHATJESUS WAS NOTA HEALER, YET MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT YOU ARE. CAN YOU COMMENT? ALSO, IS THIS A RELIGIOUS MATTER?\nYou must be kidding! Me, a healer? I am suffering from so many sicknesses myself – and I touch myself so many times in the day! The diabetes remains, my asthma remains. Just because of your holy scriptures that I have been reading for forty years continuously... they have destroyed my eyes. And I have found nothing in them – sheer garbage, to be burned.\nGodliness is a totally different thing.\nYou cannot worship it, you cannot pray to it.\nIt is not the beginning of your religion, it is the very end, the flowering. It is a quality of the man of enlightenment.\nCHAPTER 9\nBe kind to yourself, stop all this seeking\n7 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MEDITATOR AND THE LOVER HAVE DIFFERENT PATHS. THE OTHER DAY WE HEARD YOUR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION OF THE PATH OF MEDITATION. IS THIS PATH DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE LOVER? IF SO, HOW TO TELL WHICH PATH TO CHOOSE?\nThere is no path – either of meditation or of love – because a path leads to some goal. There is no goal in life. What you are searching and seeking is already present within you.\nSo the first thing to be understood is: there is no path to truth. There has never been, there is no possibility of there ever being – for the simple reason that every path leads you somewhere else, farther and farther away from yourself. If you are going somewhere a path is needed, but you are not going anywhere. You have gone so long already, so far already, from yourself. You have to drop all paths altogether.\nDrop the path and it is there.\nJesus says, “Seek, and ye shall find.” I say unto you: Stop seeking and you have found it. Jesus says, “Ask, and it shall be given.” Nonsense! Who is there to give it to you? And a truth that is given can be taken away any moment. It is worth nothing; it is against the dignity of human individuality. And why ask anybody?\nStop asking, begging, praying; you are just being stupid. You are it! In each of your breaths it is here – I will not say “there.” There is no distance between you and the truth. I say unto you, stop asking, begging, praying, and you will be surprised that it was the asking, begging and praying that was preventing you from finding it.\nJesus says, “Knock, and the doors shall be opened unto you.” The doors are already open! Where are you going to knock? And if you manage to knock, you must be knocking your head against some wall. The doors have never been closed.\nAnd that is the beauty of existence: it is always open, available – just for you to take. Existence will not respond to your questions; it responds only to your silence. And knocking is making noise, beware of it.\nCan’t you see a simple thing? You are alive, and life is truth. And out of this life many flowers blossom; out of this life grows love, out of this life grows laughter. You are not to seek life. You have been seeking it for millions and millions of years. It is time: be kind to yourself, stop all this seeking. The moment a person stops seeking, asking, knocking, he is where he always wanted to be.\nJesus was a carpenter, so the word “knocking” comes very easily to him. I cannot say that because I know, the door is open. Your eyes are closed. Are you going to knock on your eyes? Then you will go blind.\nJust see, the door is open.\nAnd you are not outside, you are inside.\nAll the religions have been teaching you that you are outside the kingdom of God. You are not, you are the kingdom of God, you are in it.\nWhatsoever the biblical story says, that God threw Adam and Eve out of paradise, I categorically contradict it. He cannot throw out Adam and Eve, because there is no place outside paradise. This whole existence is paradise – infinite in every direction. Where can you be thrown? Wherever you will be, you will be in; you cannot be out. There is no “out” in existence, all is in.\nYou say this is your understanding, that there are two paths, the paths of love and meditation. Understanding knows only one. It is misunderstanding that knows the two and the many. It is not your understanding that I have been speaking on the path of meditation. These are simply words. Call it love, call it meditation, or invent your own word, because all words are invented. The words don’t mean anything; they mean what you want them to mean.\nYou have not understood what I have been saying to you. I have been saying to you, “Drop all effort and you will be full of meditativeness.” And meditativeness cannot be anything other than love. When you are full of meditativeness, it means you are at the very center of your being. The experiencing of the very center of your being starts blossoming into love, into laughter, into a song, into a dance.\nJust remain at your center. And when I say remain at your center, I am saying that you have not moved from it; you are only dreaming that you have moved. Renounce only one thing in life I\ndo not tell you to renounce the world, to renounce the family, to renounce the wealth, no; all this is nonsense. Religion is not renouncing, religion is rejoicing.\nRejoice in the world, rejoice in your family; rejoice in all that is available to you. Rejoice simply because so much has been given by nature to you. And in this rejoicing can you think of hatred, of anger, of negativity, of any dark holes? When you are at your very center, everything is light, everything is love, everything is as it should be. You are not to do anything. This is the most difficult thing, to stop doing anything.\nHave you not seen a dead body floating in the water? When you are alive, if you don’t know swimming you will go down into the water till you die. Strange, the dead body knows some secret which you have forgotten. You cannot drown a dead body. Not that the dead body knows swimming; the dead body has stopped doing everything, swimming included. And suddenly a miracle: the dead body is floating on the water.\nPeople who drown get drowned not by the water. It is a scientific truth that just as the earth has gravitation – it pulls things downwards... water is just the opposite. Its law is not gravitation, its law is levitation; it raises things up. That’s why in water you feel light; in water you can lift a big rock very easily. The same rock you may not be able to lift outside the water, because the water – the levitation – is helping you. The person drowns not because he does not know swimming; he drowns because he makes so much effort to remain above water. That very effort exhausts him.\nIf you don’t know swimming, and by chance you fall into water, just get drowned without any effort. Just go immediately to the very bottom, and you will be lifted up by the water itself. Swimming is absolutely unnecessary.\nA Japanese scientist has been working on swimming. He started teaching six-month-old babies swimming – must be mad! But he succeeded, because six-month-old babies don’t make much effort. Then he went even to three-month-old babies; they were even more successful, they simply floated. They don’t know how to swim, how to make an effort to survive. They don’t take water as the enemy who is going to drown you, they are utterly innocent – and for a simple reason: they have a trust. In their mother’s womb they were swimming in water for nine months – not swimming, just floating.\nThat Japanese scientist is convinced, and I think his conviction is going to prove right, that even a just-born baby can be left in water and he will float. He has been floating for nine months.\nGoing to your center is just like that. You have been at your center, not only for nine months, but perhaps for nine million lives. But you go on making hectic efforts in all directions – searching, seeking, becoming Christian, becoming Hindu, reading the VEDAS and THE BIBLE and the KORAN. Naturally you prove to be a crackpot; you are going to end up insane.\nSo please don’t say that you have the understanding – you don’t have it. Yes, you have a\nmisunderstanding.\nI have not been talking about any path. I have been talking about pathlessness. Meditation is my word for pathlessness. I have not called it love, because then there is more possibility of your\nmisunderstanding. I know your love. You will immediately translate my word into your kind of love – which is not love at all. It may be chemistry, it may be hormones, it may be physiology, it may be biology, but not love.\nYou are attracted to a woman or to a man; you think you are in love. You are unaware of the fact that it is your hormones, your chemistry, your biology. Just very easily your hormones can be changed, and all your love for the woman will disappear. Your chemistry can be changed, and a man can become a woman, a woman can become a man. The difference between a man and woman is not much.\nIt is very simple. It is just like your pocket: pull it out, it becomes man; push it back into its place, it becomes woman. No other difference. Your sexuality is hanging out; their sexuality is hanging in. And you call it love?\nHave you seen animals making love? You must have seen them. Do you remember? – when they are making love they don’t look happy. They are not so foolish. They look as if they have been forced to make love. Their faces show a certain kind of despair: “What is this all about? Why am I being forced?” Look at two dogs making love – both in great trouble.\nIt is not different for man either. It is this fact that makes people want to love each other in darkness. It is good: you don’t see the face of your woman, what is happening to her; she is going into convulsions. The woman cannot see your face, because your face has turned into a monster. Next time you are making love, just see the truth of what I am saying. And you are not the one who is doing it – something is forcing you to do it. It is something surrounding you, but it is not you; it is your body, your biology.\nI know about one spider – they also make love; in this world it seems everybody makes love – and while the male spider on top of the female spider is just coming to orgasm, is trembling, the female spider starts eating him. By the time his orgasm is finished, he is also finished. Great love! And they are doing the same thing you are doing.\nThat’s why married men and women cannot live together in peace – their love does not allow them to live in peace. Soon they become prisoners for each other, torturers for each other. It is because of this fact that I have not used the word “love” for this pathlessness.\nBut once you are at your center, that means you are no longer your biology, you are no longer your physiology, you are no longer your hormones. You are just pure awareness, a witness, a small light, a flame inside, of consciousness. Meditation seems to be a better word, because you are not acquainted with it. But you can call it love if you are alert enough not to get mixed up.\nOut of meditation, there is a fragrance which is not chemical, which is not like passing through a hospital. That fragrance is love. It is not directed towards some particular address, it is not directed to some person. Do you think when a flower opens up and sends its fragrance to the winds, that fragrance is directed to some person? No, it is just overflowing. Anybody passing by can enjoy it. I say, anybody passing by can be overwhelmed by it. True love is just like that.\nWhenever I use the word “love,” this is my meaning: it is a fragrance of the flower of meditation,\nunaddressed. It is not a relationship. Yes, it may relate if somebody happens to be there. If nobody\nhappens to be there, there is no despair; the flower is enjoying its overflowing energy, it is blessed. It has given its treasure to the whole existence.\nYes, it is relating in a way, but it is relating to the whole. It is not that it will keep its fragrance and wait for the person whom it loves. That’s what you have been doing, because you don’t know the authentic quality of love. You are making it a relationship.\nSomebody attracts you; there can be any reason for that attraction. Mostly – perhaps one hundred percent, not mostly – the woman you are attracted to has something in her eyes, in the color of her hair, in her way of talking, in her voice, in her gestures, the way she walks... something in her resembles your mother. You are always in love with your mother, and your whole life you are seeking another mother. Of course, you are going to be frustrated.\nAll lovers are frustrated, except those who never manage to get married. For example, Laila and Majnu – the society did not allow them. Shiri and Fariad – their families came in. They were never frustrated, they remained lovers their whole life. They lived loving the other person, they died loving the other person. But if you come together.… They were prevented from coming together. If you come together you are going to find that this woman is not your mother.\nNow, it is a very complicated phenomenon. You cannot get married to your actual mother, or your actual father, but that’s what your biology is seeking. It never finds it. People go on changing their lovers, and each lover frustrates more, because by and by they start becoming aware that this search is never going to end. You can have all the women of the world or all the men of the world; still you will not be contented. In fact, you will be the most frustrated human being ever, because you have known all the women – now there is no hope.\nAll the old societies insist on monogamy. They are trying to prevent you from getting too frustrated. In India you will not find so much frustration as you will find in America; it is just out of the question. You are married to a woman – this life is finished. If you want to search for another, then wait for another incarnation, but in this life there is no chance. People get settled, not out of joy, it is a compromise – what else to do?\nBut in California you can never get settled. There are other women around you, other men around you. Perhaps if this woman has failed, there must be some woman who is born just for you; it is only a question of finding her. The poets have given you that idea that every man is born for a certain woman. And when they meet for the first time, lovers usually say, “We are made for each other.”\nNobody is made for each other, and it will not take long to discover that you were wrong. As your honeymoon ends, you know perfectly well, one thing is certain: you were not made for each other. No woman can be exactly like your mother, no man can be exactly like your father. In this world, everything is unique; you cannot find the same person again. But every small girl loves her father, every small boy loves his mother.\nIn a way it seems natural, but this is one of the basic causes of human misery. Later on, what are you going to do? That first imprint of his mother in a vulnerable child’s mind is going to haunt him for his whole life. Yes, fragments he may find here and there: the color of the hair, the color of the eyes, the sound of the voice. But a fragment is not the whole, and you are searching for the whole.\nThis is not love. This is biology intending to propagate; it is a strategy, a trick. Just think of one thing: if there is no joy in making love, no attraction in making love, no desire for making love, will you fall in love with somebody? Then I think that, just like a death sentence, in the courts they will give a “love sentence”: “You get married and suffer, this is your punishment.”\nBut whether courts do it or not, it has been happening for millennia. Since man has come into existence it must have been going on. No court is needed to give you a love sentence, you have given it to yourself. That’s why I avoid the word “love”; it has very ugly connotations.\nIf you try to understand, then there is a totally different kind of love. But that happens only when you have found your center. Finding the center is easy. Just not doing anything to find it is difficult.\nIt is difficult to convince you that enlightenment is a moment when you are not doing anything – the doer is absent. That’s why I call myself the lazy man’s guide for enlightenment. It is not work, it is play, relaxation.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI’M AFRAID THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO END BEFORE I GET ENLIGHTENED. WHAT CAN I DO?\nYou seem to be very much in a hurry. If you understand me, there is no problem – right now you can become enlightened. At least right now the world has not ended. There are thousands of people in the world trying for enlightenment, but their very trying is the barrier. It postpones enlightenment.\nFor ninety years J. Krishnamurti has been working, first upon himself, then upon others. And now he is getting immensely frustrated. Nobody is to be blamed, he himself has made it a difficult job. He is obsessed with reading detective novels; he has made the search for enlightenment a very sensational, puzzling, difficult detective story. My Krishnamurti Lake is doing far better: just the other day somebody became enlightened there.\nYou are asking me, “The world is going to end, what am I supposed to do?” Have I to answer you? Can’t you understand? Krishnamurti Lake is not far away.\nKrishnamurti himself will not help you. He has been just on the border of enlightenment. One step more... but that one step is missing. And the reason is that he was forced to become enlightened. For twenty-five years in his early life The theosophical idiots found him. He was nine years old, the son\nof a poor, very poor father; the mother had died, he had one brother. The father was in much difficulty. He was just a small clerk in some office; to look after these two children, and do the work – it was becoming maddening.\nSo when the Theosophists told him they would like to adopt his two children – one was Nityananda and the other was Krishnamurti – he happily handed over the children to Annie Besant, knowing that at least they would be taken care of, given a good education. The theosophical movement in those days was the top movement of the world. Very important, significant, powerful people had become involved in it.\nThe Theosophists started making these two poor boys enlightened – it had never been done before... so much hammering that Nityananda died. My feeling is that the Theosophists were responsible for his death. They tortured these two boys as much as possible: wake up in the morning at three o’clock; go to the river, take a cold bath, then chant mantras... spiritual teaching that went on deep into the night. Both escaped them finally, because it was absolutely inhuman – Nityananda in one way, Krishnamurti in another. Nityananda died – he must have been of a weaker constitution. Krishnamurti survived.\nThe Theosophists were going to declare Krishnamurti the world teacher. When he was twenty-five they gathered in Holland to declare him the world teacher, with great hope: “The man who can deliver the whole world from misery has arrived. He is the Christ, he is the Buddha; he contains all the hopes of the past humanity.”\nKrishnamurti stood up to declare himself to be the world teacher, but on the contrary, he simply said, “I am nobody’s teacher. I am fed up with teachers! And just forgive me, I am not jagadguru, the world teacher. And I dissolve this whole organization that you have created around me.” A special organization called The Star of the East, a branch of the Theosophical Society, was created for Krishnamurti. He dissolved the organization. The people were simply shocked; they had worked so hard to make him enlightened, and this man freaked out at the crucial moment.\nSince then he has been going around the earth alone. But those twenty-five years are still heavy on him; that’s why he cannot take that one step. He is not freed from those dead Theosophists. They are long dead, the movement has almost disappeared, but what happened in those twenty-five years in the beginning is holding him back.\nRemember always: love is an attachment; hate is a bigger attachment, far more solid. Compassion is very delicate, but cruelty is very hard.\nHe is still fighting with the ghosts of the Theosophists. All his life he has been fighting and fighting with those ghosts – who are dead, there is no need to fight with them. One should be simply free of them, but being free means you don’t hate them. Hate imprisons you.\nHe has become so afraid of the master and disciple phenomenon.… It is his experience – I can forgive him, I can understand him. What happened to him through his masters was so ugly that he has been teaching everybody that you don’t need any master.\nThis is a contradiction. If they don’t need any master, why are you bothering them? Who are you? You have assumed, unknowingly, the role of a master, of a teacher. What have you been doing for ninety years? – teaching people: Beware of teachers! If the people had really understood you, they would have left you, because, “What is the need? Why should we listen to you? This is what a teacher and a student, a master and a disciple do.” The master knows, the disciple does not know. The master imparts his knowledge to the disciples.\nKrishnamurti has been doing that, and I am amazed how blind people are. They don’t say to him, “Shut up! If we don’t need any master, then who are you to bother us? For ninety years you have been bothering people, and not a single person has become enlightened out of this whole effort.”\nHe has created a different kind of effort: “Don’t make effort, don’t accept any master, don’t be open to any teaching.” All kinds of egoists have surrounded him for all these years, because the egoist feels great that he need not be open, he need not listen, he need not be concerned about masters and teachers; he is enough unto himself.\nIt is true, you are enough unto yourself, but you don’t know it! Somebody has to hammer it on your head. But things can backfire. That’s what has happened in Krishnamurti’s case: a man of tremendous intelligence, fighting with ghosts, and continuing teaching, telling people there is no master, telling people, “You are enough unto yourself” – this can be misunderstood.\nYou are enough unto yourself if you relax and settle in your being; otherwise you are the greatest enemy of yourself. If you go on making an effort to become enlightened And man is so strange: if\nyou tell him that no effort is needed, he starts making “no effort”!\nKrishnamurti has never criticized any individual by name. Although he has criticized principles, doctrines, he has not criticized Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Moses, Mohammed. Just the other day I received the information that he has criticized me. This is great! He has always pretended that it is not worth his while to criticize Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira; it is something below him. That attitude is ugly.\nBut he could not restrain himself about me, for the simple reason that I have told my sannyasins, “Wherever he is, just go and sit in the front line.” And you ask me why I have chosen red clothes for you?\nThe color red has something mysterious about it – just show a red flag to a bull and you will know. You can show a blue flag, nothing will happen; a green flag, nothing will happen. But show a red flag to a bull and he will rush towards you to kill you. Krishnamurti must have been a bull in his past life. The moment he sees my red people he forgets all his philosophy, he starts immediately criticizing me. But this is the first time he has used my name.\nAnd what criticism has he given? – very childish. He has said against me that I am convincing people that enlightenment is their sheer inheritance, it is a gift of existence – just as life is a gift. I have always respected Krishnamurti, his intelligence, his courage to dissolve a great organization. But I cannot help it, I have to say the truth to you: he is just on the borderline, he is not yet enlightened. He can be any moment.\nYou should not be afraid of the third world war. For you there is enough time. But he is ninety; for him there is not much time. He should come to Krishnamurti Lake and get enlightened!\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI’M CONFUSED HEARING YOU SAY THERE IS NO GOD. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS IN MY LIFE WHEN I FEEL SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH ME WHICH I KNOW IS NOT ME. I USED TO CALL IT GOD, NOW I CALL IT GODLINESS. BUT I STILL DON’T LIKE HEARING THAT THERE IS NO GOD. CAN YOU EASE MY CONFUSION?\nBaby, my whole work is to confuse you! Unless you are utterly confused, you are not going to drop your knowledgeability. What do you mean when you ask me to “ease your confusion”? In other words, you want certain, settled knowledgeability. You want to convince yourself that you know it. I cannot commit that crime. You do not know it.\nSo first I have to remove all your knowledge – which is bogus anyway. You have not earned it, you don’t deserve it. It has not grown within you, it is all rubbish that you have collected from books, from people.\nI am going to confuse you more and more. And look, what is your confusion? You say that there have been moments in your life which you used to call God – you cannot deceive me. I know you may have experienced a few beautiful moments; everybody experiences a few beautiful moments of well-being, of great uplift.\nSeeing a sunset, suddenly you are silent. Or listening to the tidal waves of the ocean shattering on the rocks on the shore, suddenly you feel almost a nobody before this vast existence. Looking into the sky and the stars you may have had certain moments, and you may have called them God. Don’t make God so cheap. I am raising God higher than he has ever been.\nThe Jewish God says, “I am a jealous God. I am a very angry God. I am not nice, I am not your uncle.” Jesus tried to raise the Jewish God, and that was his crime. He said, “God is love.” Now, this is very contradictory. The Jewish God says, “I am jealous, I am angry, I am not nice,” and Jesus makes him a goody-goody: “God is love.”\nThis man Jesus should be removed before he destroys their certainty that God is jealous, angry. You have to be afraid of him, because that will keep you on the right path. If God is love, then who bothers what is right and what is wrong? A loving God cannot punish you in hell for eternity.\nBut Jesus on the one hand says, “God is love,” and on the other hand – he is a Jew after all – the eternal hell remains. He cannot see a simple fact, that if God is love then eternal hell should be removed – because you need not be afraid of love. Love gives you freedom to be yourself;sandwiched between heaven and hell you cannot have any freedom, any individuality.\nI am trying to raise God. When I say there is no God, I mean there is no person as God, there is no personality as God.\nYou have to understand clearly that personality is something false. The word “personality” comes from the Greek persona – persona means a mask; in Greek drama the actors used to have a mask. You know sona means sound; a sound coming through a mask was called persona. You cannot see who is behind the mask; hence the actor has a personality. And if you all have personalities, you are all actors – you are not being authentic, sincerely yourself. Personality and individuality don’t mean the same thing.\nI am taking the personality of God away. I don’t want him to be an actor – you have so many in Hollywood. Strange, that the place is called “Hollywood”... all gods, personalities, great personalities. I don’t want God to be a Hollywood actor. I am trying to destroy his mask, and once the personality drops what is left is godliness. That is the true individuality of existence.\nI will not say, “God is love,” because that still keeps God as a person. On the contrary, I say, “Love is God.” You can forget all about God. If you can understand love, that’s enough religion; more than that is not needed.\nI use the word “godliness” and you are confused, because those moments... have you seen anybody in those moments that you can call God? You have not seen anybody in those moments, because there is nobody. You were using a wrong word, I am correcting you. Those moments you can call moments of godliness. I am changing God from a quantity to a quality.\nGod is a quantity; godliness is a quality. And you are confused by it? Just a hangover. Shake yourself well – slap yourself and shake yourself – and all confusion will disappear.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHERE IS THIS MOMENT? I KEEP LOSING IT.\nHere!\nYou ask me, “Where is this moment?” Your question implies it must be somewhere else. You have already lost it. It is always here! Don’t try to find where it is, because while you are finding where it is, you are losing it. You are missing the train continuously.\nTime knows no tenses: past, present, future, no – absolutely no! Time knows only one tense, and that is now. It is always now. But your mind can carry the past and destroy the beauty of the now. Your mind can project the future, and can lose the precious moment.\nPlease, start relaxing here and now. This is the taste of it.\nCHAPTER 1 0\nBlessed are the rich\n8 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nCLERGYMAN OLDS GRANDLUND FROM SWEDEN HAS ASKED YOU A QUESTION. THE QUESTION HAS MANY QUESTIONS, SO I HAVE SEPARATED THEM. HE SAYS, “BELOVED OSHO, I HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT ABOUT MOTHER TERESA.”\nJesus!\nJesus used to teach his disciples, particularly the two fishermen who became his first disciples, how to catch men instead of catching fish. I teach my people how to catch clergymen, instead of catching simply men and women. This is going to be a great feast. We are not cannibals, otherwise we would have tasted Christianity, but still, some vegetable salad can be made.\nI have heard a small story In a school the teacher was telling the little boys and girls how God\ncreated the world, man, woman, and how he created these two sexes in trees, in birds, in animals. And when she was telling all this – that there are two sexes, man and woman – a small boy stood up. He said, “No! There are three sexes: man, woman and clergyman.” It is a totally different species.\nI have read his letter – it is so long, many questions in it. Start asking them one by one.\nI MEAN THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN DOWN IN THE SAME PIT, HOLLOW, LIKE OTHER GREAT MASTERS AND LEADERS, TO TELL BULLSHIT ABOUT OTHERS. 2 2\nFirst, he was sad because I criticized Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa wrote to me saying that she prays for me every day, and asks God to forgive me. Now, this is an absolute trespass.\nI wrote her back, “Who are you to pray for me? – and to a God who does not exist at all. And even if he existed, you have no right to pray for me! I don’t want any interference in my life, in my ways of thinking. This is violating the freedom of the individual. You stop praying to God – at least for me. I am perfectly happy, and my happiness is based on knowing that there is no God, that man is free.”\nGod was a monopolist, a fascist, an imperialist; he dominated everything. If God is there, there is no possibility of freedom; you are just puppets in his hand. He wants to create you – he creates you; he wants to destroy you – he destroys you. There is no court of appeal against him. He is the final and absolute authority. Christianity is an anti-democratic religion. And all the religions who believe in God are fascist. They have accepted slavery.\nThe clergyman... I don’t know how to address him, Mr. Clergyman or Mrs. Clergyman – because his sex is neither. So please forgive me, I will just use the address, clergyman.\nThese people are strange – so programmed, so conditioned that they cannot listen to the truth. I have no enmity with Mother Teresa. But if she writes to me that she prays to God to forgive me I\nhave not committed any sin, I have not committed any crime – why should I be forgiven? And I have not given her my power of attorney to pray for me. And if I say this, you are disturbed that I criticized Mother Teresa.\nThis clergyman was leaving yesterday; he had packed, he was so angry. But then he decided to write all these questions, and decided to listen to what I am going to say. I think after today it will be difficult for him to remain one more day.\nMother Teresa has many orphanages in India. Why in India? Why not in Christian countries? A simple fact.… Those orphans in India she collects from the streets – urchins – and then converts them to Catholicism. It is a politics of numbers. In each of her orphanages there are hundreds of orphans who are being taught Christianity – Catholicism more particularly.\nThose orphans are born either of Hindus or Mohammedans; none of them belong to Christianity. But to increase the numbers of Catholics in the world – because numbers mean power – she feeds them, clothes them, provides medical facilities; hence even stupid Hindus and Mohammedans think she is a saint. She is a sheer, dirty politician.\nOne man with his wife, from America, went to Mother Teresa to adopt a child, because they were childless and the doctors had said that there was no possibility – physiologically they could not have a child; it would be better to adopt one. Mother Teresa said, “You can choose. We have beautiful boys, girls – seven hundred.” But she forgot to ask what their religion was. She assumed they must be Catholics; only Catholics come there.\nAnd as she remembered she had not asked their religion, she asked them. They said, “We are Protestant Christians.” Now there was a great silence. She said, “Excuse me. Right now we don’t have one orphan to give you.” Just a moment before there were seven hundred orphans; now there is not even a single one. And the man and the woman, the couple, were neither Mohammedan,\nnor Buddhist, nor Hindu. They were Christians – but they were not Catholic Christian, they were Protestant Christian.\nThey wrote a letter to the newspapers describing the whole story, and saying, “This is strange. We were turned away, we were not taken in. We had no idea that those children are only provided for adoption by Catholics.”\nWhen I wrote to her, asking, “What is this nonsense? What is going on?” she tried to convince me that what she had done was right. She said, “Yes, there were orphans, but because they had been brought up according to Catholicism, they would not fit into a Protestant family.”\nCannot I be allowed to ask her, “Why in the first place have they been brought up according to Catholicism? They were not born Catholics. If you want to teach them religion, then the Hindu orphans should be taught according to Hinduism. If they are Mohammedan, they should be taught Mohammedanism.\n“And what a poor argument! You can convert a fully grown-up Hindu, who has lived his whole life as a Hindu, into a Catholic, and there is no problem. But those small children who have been taught the Catholic catechism cannot be accepted in a Protestant family which is Christian? There is not much difference between Protestantism and Catholicism. So where is the problem?” She stopped writing to me.\nAnd if I say these things publicly, this poor clergyman is offended. He wanted to leave. Read the first question again.\nI HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT ABOUT MOTHER\nTERESA. 3 3\nI like it! And I am going to talk as much bullshit as possible. And what is wrong with bullshit? It is divine. And all this bullshit will fall on the clergyman, remember. He will not be able to find his way back to the church.\nWhat do I care whether you like it or not? I am not here to convert you, convince you. And I am not talking to a single religion. Here are people from all religions, from all countries, all ideologies.\nAnd if my talking against Mother Teresa hurts you, it is your problem. It is not hurting anyone else. And why does it hurt? You should ponder over it. Why does it make you sad? It is your programmed mind. And my effort is simply deprogramming. So whenever I deprogram a Hindu he will also think I am talking bullshit.\nYou should rather contemplate why it hurts you. You are not Mother Teresa. And whatever I am saying, I am giving you absolutely valid arguments. If you were really hurt, sad, you should have given arguments in favor of Mother Teresa. You have not given a single argument in your long letter. You don’t have any! You cannot deny what I am saying, that’s what makes you sad. Try to deny it, accept my challenge. It will help you. Whatever I say, I say with full conviction, and I give you my argument, why I am saying it.\nTo trespass somebody’s garden is illegal, to trespass somebody’s house is illegal. And she is trespassing my being – praying for me, giving me no answer. This is her answer – praying for me, to a God in whom I don’t believe.\nPlease try to find something in favor of Mother Teresa.\nHE SAYS, “I LOVE JESUS MORE THAN ANYONE.” 4 4\nHe also says – you have forgotten – that I have fallen in the same hollow pit as other great masters and leaders. I am neither a great master nor a great leader. I am a simple, ordinary man. I don’t want to be categorized with all those fools.\nBeing simple and ordinary has one beauty: you cannot fall. To fall, one thing is absolutely necessary, that you should be high, great, on the top of the world. I do not belong to that category. I live a simple, human life, with all its weaknesses, frailties, mistakes. I cannot fall, there is nowhere to fall. If you want to fall, first go up a ladder. I have been walking my whole life on the plain ground.\nThis is strange. First you make me a great master, a great leader, just to make me fall from there. I know enough logic.… From the roots I cut things. I don’t claim to be great. Only people who are suffering from an inferiority complex claim to be great masters, great leaders of men. I don’t have any inferiority complex. I don’t want to be superior to anybody in the world.\nWhatsoever I am, I am tremendously happy and at ease with it. So please show me how I can fall. An infallible pope may fall, but I am fallible, and not a pope. But I cannot fall in his pit. And why does he say I have fallen in a pit? – because I am “talking bullshit about Mother Teresa.” Yes, there is a mistake. I should talk cow dung about Mother Teresa. Bullshit is male; cow dung is female – and she is very old, dried cow dung.\nAnd I can say these things because I don’t want any respectability from anyone. The clergyman will be in a difficulty because he has dealt with people whom you can exploit by the simple strategy of giving them respectability. When you give respectability to somebody, he becomes afraid to say anything that may destroy his respectability.\nI do not care at all what people think about me. I am not dependent on them. If I hanker for respectability, then certainly I will not say anything that may destroy my respectability.\nI am going to say exactly what is the truth to me. If it brings me notoriety– it has brought me notoriety in these thirty years – I enjoy it.\nHE SAYS, “YOU TELL ABOUT JOY, LOVE, LIFE, CELEBRATION, FREEDOM, ET CETERA. MY QUESTION JUST NOW IS, CAN YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR OWN LIFE – REPEATEDLY SHOWING YOURSELF IN ROLLS ROYCES AND FEMININE CLOTHES, SAYING, REPEATING WORDS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, MOTHER TERESA ET CETERA, HAVING BODYGUARDS – ANY FREEDOM, CELEBRATION, JOY?” 5 5\nIt really amazes me to know that clothes also have genitals! This clergyman is saying that some clothes are female and some clothes are male. Mr. Clergyman, are you nuts? Clothes are either comfortable or not comfortable. I use what is comfortable to me.\nIn fact, just on the way coming here I enquired about the clergyman to my secretary: “Has he got a beard and a mustache?”\nShe said, “No.”\nI said, “That is feminine.”\nWhy have you cut your beard and your mustache, which God has created in you? That’s what so many men have done. Just think of a woman with a big beard and mustache. And it is not only a mustache and beard.…\nAs I have told you, Christianity is the worst of all religions – I never say anything without supporting it with valid reasons. Before the communist revolution in Russia, there was a big Christian sect – Russia was one of the most orthodox Christian countries. The most famous and the most respected Christians were those who used to cut off their genitals. Every year men would cut off their genitals, women would cut off their breasts.\nWhatsoever wrong communism has done in Russia, at least one thing good they have done: they have stopped these idiots doing such an utterly insane thing. And this gave those Christians respectability; they became saints.\nI looked at my dress and I could not find that it is feminine; it is comfortable, it is beautiful. I am not a soldier who has to be in clothes so tight that just his tight clothes make him kill somebody, so tight he just wants to get out of the clothes.\nI am a lazy person. My clothes are nothing – just a loose robe. Without any effort I can take it off, put it on. And strange, that a clergyman should indicate to me that this is feminine. I am reminded... I lived for a few months in a place called Raipur in India; I was a lecturer at Raipur University. Just near my house two trucks collided and killed somebody who was crushed so badly that it was impossible to recognize who it was.\nSomebody came running to me and asked me, “What can be done now? A woman has been crushed, and she has died.”\nI went there. I said, “Why do you say this is a woman?”\nIt was a Mohammedan area where I lived. Mohammedan women wear a black mask over their face and a black robe over their whole body. You cannot see a Mohammedan woman’s body. She can see through small holes in front of her eyes. So they thought that this must be a Mohammedan woman. It was a man – not a man, a Christian clergyman in his black habit.\nI wonder why Christian clergymen call their dresses habits, black habits. And why have they chosen the black color when there are so many beautiful colors? In fact, black is not a color at all. Black is an absence of all colors.\nIf you see a rainbow, there are two colors you will not find there: black and white. White is a combination of all the seven colors of the rainbow; it is the richest color. Seven colors meeting and\nmerging create the white. And black is not a color, it is the absence of all seven colors. That’s why down the centuries, around the world, death has been conceived as black – because it is the absence of life, the absence of everything.\nWhy have Christians chosen the black robe as their habit? They are not messengers of God on the earth, they are the messengers of death! Their black robe indicates their intention. They are all Reverend Jim Joneses; they want to turn this whole earth into a Jonestown.\nHe is talking about my clothes. I use all the colors. The rainbow is my love. I want finally to give all my sannyasins rainbow dresses. I am waiting for the right time. First I want you, through your red dress, to be identified: that you are not part of any old, rotten religion, that you don’t belong to the blind society that surrounds you, that you are asserting your individuality.\nYou may have wondered why I don’t use red – because I don’t want you to be my imitators. I don’t want anybody to say, “Why do you imitate Osho?” My seamstresses – Gayan, Veena, Arpita, Ashu – I have told them to avoid red as far as possible in my clothes. I don’t want you to imitate me. I don’t want you in any way to lose your individuality.\nThe red color is just to shock the outsiders. The color red has some mysterious quality. Nobody can ignore it; it just hits the eyes. Go in a red robe anywhere in the world, and everybody will look at you. Even if you pass people, they will stop and look again: what is the matter with this man?\nDo you know the meaning of the word “respect”? It is not honour, it means seeing again – re-spect. The red color creates great respect.\nHE ASKS FURTHER, “AREN’T YOU SPEAKING IN ONE WAY AND LIVING IN ANOTHER WAY? I FEEL MUCH MORE FREE, JOYFUL THAN YOU, YOUR SANNYASINS – YES, EVERYONE IN RAJNEESHPURAM. WHEN I SEE YOU, I SEE A PRISONER IMPRISONED IN YOUR OWN PRISON.” 6 6\nGreat! Then why are you here? If you think you are more happy than me, more blissful than me, more free than me, then what are you doing here? Why have you been coming here year after year, each celebration? Are you crazy?\nI don’t go anywhere. There is nothing anywhere which can make me happier. And what criterion are you using? When you say that you are more blissful than me, there must be some criterion, some way to decide who is more blissful. A blissful person does not go in search of bliss – and you are here in search of bliss. Why are you listening to me, wasting your time? You must be miserable. You want to get rid of that misery.\nAnd still you address me as “Beloved Osho.” You don’t know the meaning of “Osho,” it seems. It means the blessed one. There is no possibility of being more blissful then the blessed one. Perhaps your addressing me as “Beloved Osho” is just Christian hypocrisy.\nAnd you call me “Beloved.” On what grounds? A man who is talking bullshit – are you in love with bullshit? A man who is talking against Mother Teresa and Jesus – are you in some way against Mother Teresa and Jesus but afraid to say so, because it will go against your vested interest? You\nare a clergyman – that is your job; you are getting money for it, respect for it. I am not getting anything, no salary, no money. I don’t have a single cent with me. I don’t have even pockets in my robe.\nTwenty years ago I told my tailors to drop the pocket. It is unnecessary, because I don’t have anything to put in the pocket. And for twenty years I have lived without any money. You cannot find a single man in the world who has lived twenty years without money. I have not even touched money for twenty years – not that I am against money. I have not seen a dollar yet, although for years I have been in America. And I don’t think there is any possibility for me to see a dollar before I die.\nYou talk about Rolls Royces. I don’t own them. And why do you ask about Mother Teresa, Jesus Christ, Rolls Royces? Is there some connection? There is bound to be in your mind. You seem to be jealous, utterly jealous. I don’t own any Rolls Royces. Those Rolls Royces are owned by my sannyasins; out of their love they provide a Rolls Royce for me for one hour every day. I don’t even know which Rolls Royce they are going to bring today, it is up to them.\nAnd why have they chosen Rolls Royces for me, just for one hour? Because my back is bad. They tried all other cars; only the Rolls Royce seat suits my back. Now what can I do? It is the fault of the Rolls Royce people. And anyway, I am a man of very simple taste. I am utterly satisfied with anything which is the best.\nBut why should a clergyman be concerned? Poor fellow, he needs a four-wheeler Ford.\nIt is a good strategy for me to move in Rolls Royces – and not just one. I would like the clergyman to burn even more – there are ninety Rolls Royces. And it is not the end! My sannyasins are trying to have at least three hundred and sixty-five Rolls Royces, so only once in a year, for one hour, do I get the the same Rolls Royce. And I know they will be able to manage, because I am not a poor man’s savior. I am the rich man’s savior.\nSo many people are saving poor people, nobody is looking after the rich. They are completely ignored. This is inhuman. There are thousands of saints looking after the welfare of the poor. I am the only one – and I am not even a saint – who is looking after the welfare of the rich.\nI will manage, if there is any heaven anywhere – I know there is none, but just for the argument’s\nsake If there is any heaven anywhere, then a camel may pass through the eye of a needle, but not a poor man through the gates of heaven.\nA poor man in heaven will look out of place. Only the people who have lived in luxury will be able to become part of paradise. They are already disciplined to luxury. If you have never tasted wine and you enter the Mohammedan paradise, where water is not available and you have to drink only wine, what will happen to you?\nIf you have been celibate, as this clergyman must be pretending – because all celibacy is pretension, you cannot go against nature And foolishly he has himself admitted that he has four girlfriends. To\nhis congregation he must be a celibate man, and behind the curtains he has four girlfriends. Are you a Mohammedan, by the way? A poor man you cannot think of his misery when he finds himself in\nparadise, with everybody singing, “Alleluia! Alleluia!” and doing nothing, because there is nothing to\ndo.\nI teach my people the art of non-doing – that is the preparation for paradise. I teach my people to\nsing, “Alleluia” – that is the preparation for paradise.\nA poor man will be simply in a foreign land in paradise; he will not be able to make any connection with the situation that has been depicted as paradise. Rivers of wine, beautiful girls who always remain young... and the whole work is just to go on playing on your harp and singing.\nI have heard... once it happened to a poor man. The poor man was a porter in Munich in Germany, drinking as much beer as possible, speaking language which is not included in dictionaries, fighting for any excuse – just ready to fight. By some mistake, he entered paradise when he died. It must have been a mistake – even angels of death are not infallible. Somebody else was wanted, but they took him there.\nHe was so miserable there! He had been a porter on the station, and he was very happy – the whole day working and then drinking, and then finding some woman. And doing everything In paradise\nthere was nothing. Beer was not available. The women who were available were so beautiful he was afraid even to approach them. He had known only prostitutes, poor prostitutes; he had never known those beautiful prostitutes of paradise.\nHe was handed a harp and told, “Sit on a cloud and just say, ‘Alleluia, alleluia.’”\nHe said, “This is a strange place. I was far better in my station, doing my job, waiting for the evening to\ngo to the pub, then searching for a woman. This is a strange place. Sit on a cloud?”\nHe had never played on a harp, he had not even seen a harp in his life. He was so angry, but what else to do? – he started making an effort to play on a harp. It was not music, he knew nothing of music. He wanted to punch somebody on the nose. He was looking all around for this so-called God to ask, “What nonsense is this?”\nIn paradise you don’t sleep at all. It is always day, it is always light. And he was habituated to using his language, so although he used to sing, “Alleluia, alleluia,” in between he would say, “Fuck you all!” and again, “Alleluia, alleluia.”\nIt was reported to the guard that this man is dangerous. He says loudly, ‘Alleluia! Alleluia!’ and in between he inserts, ‘Fuck you all!’ He was sent back to Munich. He was so happy you cannot conceive.\nI said to you I am not a saint. To me the word “saint” is more obscene than “Fuck you all,” because fucking is natural. Everybody is doing it – even the clergyman. What everybody is doing, how can it be obscene? When the whole of nature is doing it, how can it be obscene? When even your God was doing it, what is obscene in it?\nBut the word “saint” is obscene. You may not be aware of where it comes from. It comes from “sanction” – the pope gives the sanction to somebody, and makes him a saint. This is simply absurd. Who can make me a saint? I don’t accept anybody’s authority. And a pope giving the sanction – then sainthood becomes something like a certificate.\nIt happened to Joan of Arc; Christians burned her alive. Christians have committed so many sins in the world that if there is any hell, it will be full of Christians: clergymen, bishops, archbishops, popes, Jesus Christ.\nBurning living people, and particularly women – it seems to be a certain psychological revenge, because the priests of Christian communities were prohibited from any relationship with a woman. They were really enraged. They wanted to do something to hurt the woman, because the woman was very attractive. Remember, whenever you are attracted to somebody immensely, you also feel to destroy that person or that thing. Why? – because your being attracted to it makes you a slave.\nThat’s why men and women cannot live together harmoniously. Both are attracted to each other, and both are destructive to each other. All these husbands and wives are continuously fighting, nagging, harming each other in every possible way. The reason is, they are attracted to each other. They cannot leave each other, and they cannot live together. They are in a fix.\nThe priest, the clergyman, is in an even more difficult situation. The woman attracts – attracts him more than anybody else, because others have some experience of woman and he has none. He would like somehow to force the woman to be destroyed, because deep in his heart is not Jesus Christ – it is Mary Magdalene. He goes on repressing Mary Magdalene by repeating some stupid prayer. But he knows perfectly well she is there, so he wants to destroy the woman.\nIn the Middle Ages, Christians burned thousands of innocent women – they just had to find an excuse. And the excuse was that the women were in a conspiracy with the devil.\nChristians have been taught that the woman has been an agent of the devil from the days of Adam and Eve. The serpent did not approach Adam, he approached Eve. Since then the woman has been somehow in connection with the devil. In the Middle Ages the Christians accused thousands of women of having sexual relationships with the devil: “They are witches, and they are dangerous to the society. They should be burned.”\nThey declared Joan of Arc also a witch. Of course she is one of the most significant persons who has ever walked on this earth. Single-handedly she fought for the freedom of her country, and attained freedom for her country. Certainly it gave the clue to the clergymen that she must be deriving all her power from the devil; otherwise a fragile woman, a young woman – how can she be so powerful? This was the reward that they gave to her: they condemned her as a witch and burned her alive. This was the judgment of an infallible pope.\nAfter three hundred years another infallible pope reconsidered the case – because people were not agreeing with it. It was such an ugly act in the name of God. You rewarded the woman who brought freedom to the country by burning her alive? To keep these people on the side of the church, after three hundred years another infallible pope – remember the word “infallible” – declared that she is a saint.\nNobody asks, if both the popes were infallible Then it seems to be impossible – how are you going\nto manage? One declares her a witch to be burned alive; another declares, after three hundred years, that she is a saint. Her bones were dug out from her grave and worshipped.\nMany nuns were burned alive, many priests and monks were burned alive, but ninety percent of those who were burned alive were women. Even nuns – they were forced to confess, they were tortured to confess that they had had intercourse with the devil. Can you see how the mind becomes perverted when you go against nature? And they were tortured so much that they had to confess.\nThe same tactics have been used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, but the whole credit goes to Christianity. Torture a person – there is a limit, and then the person thinks, that there is no point in being tortured and again and again with the same question. It is better to accept it and be finished with it.\nThey were tortured and asked, “Have you had any intercourse with the devil?” Now nobody today can even imagine that there is a devil and women are having intercourse with him. Of course because the devil is a man – and he is not a homosexual – that’s why women were tortured. And they were told, “You have to confess the reality.” Finally they confessed; and their confessions are very significant to remember. Mr. Clergyman, please remember what those nuns confessed.\nAfter the confession they were burned, because they had admitted, they had confessed that they had had intercourse many times with the devil. But what was the proof? And Christian priests have been giving them proof: the proof was that the woman said that the devil has a forked prick, so that he can enter the woman’s body from both holes. Great holy people! And the women – thousands in number – confessed. They were nuns. And they were burned.\nNow the devil has disappeared completely. After Sigmund Freud, he thought it was better to leave this earth. The few men – monks – who were burned, were burned because they were making sexual approaches or contacts with nuns. You call this a religion?\nAnd if these clergymen, priests, reach heaven, where beautiful men, beautiful women, are all living in absolute freedom, with no fear of sin, with no guilt I have not come across a single reference that\nin heaven there are churches, and there are clergymen, and there are congregations. All that stupidity happens only on this poor earth.\nAll the priests of all the religions are looking after the poor, exploiting them, exploiting their poverty to convert them to their religion.\nI am taking care of the rich. Blessed are the rich, for theirs is the kingdom of God. And of course, in heaven you will get a Rolls Royce. Anything less than that would be a humiliation of paradise, of your God himself. What do you think – which car does your God use? I think it must be a Rolls Royce.\nWhy is this clergyman so worried about it? It is my problem. If I have to suffer for being in a Rolls Royce and go to hell, I am perfectly happy. In fact I don’t want to go to your heaven, because the best people of the earth will be found in hell, if it is there.\nWhere will you find Gautam Buddha? He denied God; he must be in hell. Where will you find Mahavira? He denied God; he must be in hell. Where will you find all your great painters, singers, dancers, poets, musicians? They cannot enter heaven.\nThey have committed so much sin in the eyes of the Christian priests, they must be in hell. You will find all the geniuses in hell – if there is any hell. Of course, there is none.\nThis priest, this clergyman, must have forgotten my watches, thinking that the letter is becoming too long. But what is the problem? There are a few people who write to me, but they don’t know at all about my watches. This is the cheapest watch in the world. These are not diamonds, these are stones, ordinary stones. It is made by my own sannyasins, it is not a Piaget. My own sannyasins, Ajito and Bodhi, out of their love make watches for me.\nAnd I love everything beautiful. Look at this watch! I don’t make any difference between a beautiful diamond or a beautiful stone. The criterion is beauty. Yes, a few of my sannyasins allow me to use real diamond watches. I have no objection.\nIn Jainism, which is one of the most ancient religions of the world, in their heaven, mountains are made of diamonds, gold, silver. If in your heaven you can have mountains of diamonds, can’t I have a small watch? This seems to be absolutely consistent. Be rich, be luxurious, be comfortable, because whatever you are here, wherever you go you will be able to adjust to more luxury, to a higher standard of living.\nDon’t listen to these idiot clergymen. If you live in a poor way.… And that’s what all the religions teach – live in poverty; if you are not poor you will miss everything after life. I can’t see the logic. Here you practice poverty.…\nMahatma Gandhi was practicing poverty. In his ashram even mosquito nets were not allowed; it is luxurious. And in India everywhere there are mosquitos, and particularly in Gandhi’s ashram they had a great gathering – naturally, so much food, so easily available.\nWhat did Gandhi invent to prevent the mosquitoes? He cannot allow them to be killed by Flit, because he is a non-violent man, he believes in non-violence. Mosquitoes are not to be killed, and a mosquito net is also not good, because it is a luxury. I cannot conceive, a mosquito net is a luxury? So he told his disciples: “Before you go to sleep, put kerosene oil on your face, on your hands, or any part of your body that is exposed.” Kerosene oil.…\nMahatma Gandhi’s son, Ramdas, used to be my friend. I asked Ramdas, “If even mosquitoes have enough sensibility not to come close to a person who is painted with kerosene oil – it stinks, even a mosquito is not ready, even though he may die without food – what about the man? How can he sleep with this smell?” But those who did that were great saints.\nYou will be surprised to know – particularly this clergyman – that in Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram there was a man, Professor Bhonsali, who lived for six years eating only bullshit. And he was worshipped like a god. He had done a great act of austerity – just eating bullshit for six months.\nThis clergyman should try. At least for six days, eat bullshit, and you will forget all your Mother Teresas and all your Jesuses. And then you will remember me!\nHE FURTHER STATES, “OSHO, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME PIECES OF HELL AND HEAVEN HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM.” 7 7\nOn one thing I can agree with you: I may have given you pieces of hell, that is my business. The other part I cannot agree with. I cannot give you pieces of heaven, you must have been hallucinating.\nI know what is actually the case. Whenever I said something which was in agreement with his conditioned mind, he felt euphoric. It was not me, it was your conditioned mind feeling nourished, supported. Those were the pieces of heaven. And whenever I said something which gave you an electric shock, of course those were the pieces of hell. You cannot hallucinate and imagine shocks, electric shocks – that’s why I must have given them to you.\nYou are hallucinating, imagining, projecting heaven. So whenever I say something which falls in tune with your conditioning, you feel great. You feel great that you are right, that your religion is right, that your BIBLE is right.\nYou are certain that your religion is right. You are looking for certainty, for guarantee. And strange – you are more blissful than me, and you are asking for my authority? I have never asked for anybody’s authority, I have never asked for anybody’s support. I have simply lived on my own. I don’t belong to any religion, I don’t belong to any philosophy.\nIt simply shows that whenever your belief system is supported, you will feel good, great; and whenever hammered, you will feel bad. But in fact, those moments that you feel I have given you of heaven are poisonous, because they are making you cling more tightly to your conditioning.\nThe moments that you call “of hell” are the real thing. Only those moments, if you are courageous enough, if you have guts – which is very rare in clergymen, because why should a man who has guts become a clergyman? – if you have any guts, then forget all those moments of heaven, and remember those moments of hell. They are going to help you.\nMy work is surgical. I have to cut so much crap which is clinging to you, and you are clinging to it. It hurts, I know. It hurts. You can forgive me for hurting you – but don’t forget that this hurting is being caused by your clinging.\nIf you really listen to me, and you see that something is so and drop it instantly, you will not feel any pieces of hell, moments of hell. And the moment you drop all that is painful to part with, a new phenomenon will happen to you. The moments of hell disappearing will make you able to see that your moments of heaven are only hallucination. You have been drugged from your very childhood. All religions are nothing but opium. And if you can drop both, you will be free for the first time.\nYou are saying that you are more free than me, you are more free than my sannyasins in Rajneeshpuram. Don’t befool yourself. You say that I live in a prison. I don’t live in a prison. Yes, I live in my room almost the whole day. But the reason why I live there is because the world outside has nothing more to offer to me. And the world inside me is so rich, so overflowingly rich, that I need not go looking outside. Yes, roses are beautiful, but inside me I have seen bigger, more alive, more fragrant roses blooming. Now, what do you suppose I should do?\nI am the freest man in the whole history of humanity. It is out of my freedom that I am inside my room. Nobody is preventing me. On the contrary, my personal physicians, Devaraj and Shunyo; my caretaker, Vivek; my secretary – they are all trying to get me somehow to go out.\nI am trying here for you to go in!\nYes, there are guards around me, because I am not a suicidal person. I am not as suicidal as your Jesus Christ was. He had absolute knowledge that that day he was going to be caught. What was the need for him to go to Jerusalem, unless he was attracted towards death? He had a very great death instinct in him. I don’t have any suicidal instinct in me. Both things disappeared together: the desire for eternal life and the desire to commit suicide. They are two sides of the same coin. I threw away that coin thirty-two years ago.\nThose guards around me are not placed by me but by my people. You have to remember that I must be the most fortunate person to have so many intelligent people around me. Just look at who Jesus had: fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters. He had only one man, Judas, who was a little literate and a little intelligent; otherwise, those so-called apostles needed adult education.\nI am here to share myself with you. I have no concern with the moment that has passed, and I have no concern for the moment that is coming. But my people would certainly like me to be with them as long as possible.\nIt is their arrangement. Not only have they arranged the guards, they have arranged every medical facility in my house, every surgical facility in my house. Any moment, if anything happens, they don’t want to lose time taking me to Portland or to Bend or to Redmond. And I never interfere with anybody. If this is their joy, they should do it.\nWho am I to interfere? If somebody wants to kill me, I will not interfere even in that. But if somebody wants to save me, do you want me to interfere in it? And these guards have done no harm to anybody in four years. They are just standing there as a precaution. And it is not me who is responsible for them standing there. But my people are free to do anything they want to do for me.\nIt would have been beautiful if Jesus had also had some intelligent people around him. Only Judas was a little intelligent, and he betrayed. Perhaps he did well, because he must have seen this suicidal instinct in Jesus. He must have seen that Jesus wanted to be a martyr, he was not going to listen to anybody. He wanted to be on the cross, because by his teachings he had not been able to convert the Jews to Christianity. He was hoping, perhaps, that what he had not been able to do, his martyrdom, his crucifixion may do. And he was right – it happened.\nThere is no Christianity in the world; it is only “crossianity.” The cross made a great impact, aroused sympathy towards him, just as my Roll Royces and my watches arouse in you jealousy, my clothes create jealousy. But if I was hanging on a cross, then this clergyman would have been at my feet praying to God.\nIt is strange but true, that you are sympathetic to misery, to poverty, to sickness, to death. Have you ever thought what it means? You are never sympathetic with somebody who is blissful, happy, joyous, dancing, singing, has no worry at all, no tension. Have you felt any sympathy with that man? Have you gone to that man and said, “I have great sympathy for you”? You would look foolish. He does not need your sympathy in the first place. In the second place, his being in a blissful state creates jealousy in you, not sympathy.\nThe crucifixion of Jesus created great sympathy, and out of that sympathy was born this whole cancer of Christianity.\nI am not asking for your sympathy; otherwise I would be carrying my cross on my shoulders. I do not care, because to ask for your sympathy simply means that I am empty within, that I want to fill that empty hollowness through your sympathy, your love, your compassion. No.\nWhy do people get angry with me? Why do they become arrogant, aggressive towards me? The reason is simple. I am so blissful that only great jealousy starts burning in their hearts. You have never loved anybody who is going higher and higher in his happiness.\nIf your house is on fire, even your enemies will come to sympathize with you, even those who were not on talking terms with you. But if you make a beautiful marble palace, even your friends will disappear. The jealousy That jealousy is all over the letter of the clergyman.\nFINALLY HE SAYS, “BLESSINGS.” 8 8\nPlease forgive me, I cannot accept it. I have so much blessedness in me, I am just blissed-out. What am I going to do with a poor man’s blessings? And what blessings can you give to me? You don’t have them in the first place to give. This is simply egoistic stupidity.\nYou should have asked for my blessings. I have them and I can give them to you, or to anybody. In fact, I am simply throwing them to everybody!\nPlease forgive me, this clergyman destroyed your whole morning.\nCHAPTER 1 1\nThat explosion of bliss\n9 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nJ. KRISHNAMURTI HAS CRITICIZED YOU AND SAID THAT YOU ARE A SELF-APPOINTED MASTER. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?\nIt seems that J. Krishnamurti has finally become senile. It is time too, he is ninety years old. What he has said is absurd. Who was appointed before me? Was Gautam Buddha an appointed master? Was Moses an appointed master? Was Jesus appointed by somebody? There are things which blossom on their own. It is not a government bureaucracy, where you are appointed. And if a master is appointed by somebody else, he can be dis-appointed any moment. Nobody can dis-appoint me.\nIt is not a criticism of me, it is a criticism of himself. He is the only man in the whole history of humanity who was appointed by others as a world teacher. And it is very strange – the people who appointed him as a world teacher were themselves ignorant. They were waiting for the world teacher to make them awake. These sleeping and snoring Theosophists appointed J. Krishnamurti as the world teacher.\nIt is good that he refused. He refused the organization, he refused the idea of being a world teacher. But his refusal seems only superficial, he has remained a teacher all his life. What has he been doing for almost a century? – teaching. But where is the appointment order?\nTo know oneself is not something that anybody else can do for you. And more particularly, how can sleeping people help the one who is awake? They are dreaming; in their sleep they can only dream. Do you expect these sleeping people to appoint the awakened one? That would be hilarious.\nYes, nobody has appointed me. On that point he is not absolutely wrong. But there is another point also, which is a little delicate. I say nobody has appointed me, including myself. I am not a “self- appointed master.” Whenever there is a master, he is recognized, not appointed.\nWhen the rose flowers, you don’t make it flower, but you can recognize the fragrance. Even in your sleep you can feel that the night is over and the sun has arisen. You are just hanging between sleep and waking. You may take time to wake up, but somewhere deep down in you, you know it is time to wake up.\nI am not appointed by anybody – to be appointed is an insult. And I am not appointed by myself, because what is the need? – I know it.\nThe word “master” in the world of spirituality has a totally different meaning. It is not the same as a schoolmaster. A master in the spiritual sense is one who has mastery over himself, who does not function unconsciously, whose every act – even the smallest gesture – is conscious, alert. He may not have a single disciple – it doesn’t matter.\nDo you see the point? The word “master” creates the idea of the disciple, the follower. How can there be a master without a disciple, a follower? But in the spiritual sense of the word “master” means mastery of oneself. It has no relationship with any following; it does not depend on the crowd. A master can be just alone.\nI had started alone, and then slowly people started joining my caravan. I was really surprised – I am still surprised. Surprised, because how did these people recognize the fragrance, the flowering of self- mastery? They are not awake, but one thing is certain: they are not asleep either. Just the early morning hours You know, everybody knows, that you are awake and still pretending to sleep. You\nwould have loved to sleep, but what to do?\nI have never said that I am a master. It is something others have to understand. I am not like Jesus who goes on proclaiming himself to be the messenger of God, the only begotten son of God, and all that crap. Of course, it is Christian crap. I am not like Mohammed, who says “I am the messenger of God, and the last messenger. After me there is going to be no change in the message.” Did God die fourteen hundred years ago, when Mohammed declared, “I am the last prophet”?\nI do not claim anything, and I am criticized for things which I have never claimed. I am not a prophet, I am not a messiah, I am not a messenger from any God – because there is no God. Yes, I am an alert, conscious, ordinary man.\nThe whole beauty is that I have not proclaimed anything, and still you have heard it. I have not said it, and you have understood it. I have not knocked on your doors, I have not tried to convince you about anything. I have never bothered about any respectability. I have just lived in my own way, according to my own consciousness.\nI don’t claim that you are my followers. All followers are blind – only the blind need to follow. Without any claim on my side, millions of people around the world have come closer and closer to me. It is a miracle.\nI don’t count Jesus as a man of miracles. Whatever are called his miracles are invented by the Christians. Secondly, even if he had done those miracles, they are third-rate. Making bread out of stones.… If this is true, there should not have been any Ethiopia. Half of the world would not be dying. If he can change a stone into bread, then why not change the whole Himalayas into a big bread? The secret is the same.\nHe turns water into wine. And I am always amazed – from Christian pulpits this is declared to be a great miracle. This is a crime! What about Jesus turning water into hashish, marijuana, LSD? He would be behind bars! Do you think wine is not of the same category? In fact, it is worse. LSD is far superior and less harmful.\nYes, if he had turned wine into water, I would call it a miracle, and not illegal either. But I say to you, he has not done any of these things, because if he had done these things – healing the people who are sick, making the blind see, the lame walk, the dead come back to life again – just average intelligence is needed to see it: if a man had done all these things, do you think the Jews would have asked that he be crucified?\nIf a man had done the miracle of raising the dead Lazarus back to life, the whole of Judea would have fallen at his feet. That seems to be absolutely natural. You can think yourself – if you see somebody raising dead people to life, what are you going to do, crucify this man?\nAnd how can you crucify a man who raises dead people to life? You may have crucified him, but the man could have turned the crucifixion into anything he wanted. The cross may have become a golden throne. If stones can become bread, water can become wine, what is so impossible? The cross becomes a golden throne That did not happen. Jesus could not save himself.\nI do not claim anything. I am just like you. But what can I do? If you feel some fragrance arising out of my being, and you start moving towards me from faraway lands – in spite of all the difficulties – then I must say you are doing miracles. I am only a witness to what is happening.\nIt is time for J. Krishnamurti to shut up completely. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE SAID THAT ALL YOUR WORDS OF THE PAST ARE NOT IMPORTANT. SO WHAT ARE ALL YOUR BOOKS FOR?\nJesus! I have never said that my books of the past are not important! But you may have heard that. What I had said is that to me truth is not something unchanging. Anything unchanging is dead.\nTruth is alive, breathing, moving. So when I am saying something to you now, don’t be bothered about the past – what I said twenty years before. And I say to you, if I am still here tomorrow, the truth will have become more potent, deeper, higher. My books of the past are not unimportant.\nI am just like a tree. When it comes to blossom, do you think now the roots are unimportant, the trunk is no longer needed, the leaves are unnecessary, because the tree has blossomed, the flowers have come? No, you don’t say that. You know perfectly well that those flowers are intrinsically connected with the hidden roots in the earth. It is all one process. The flowers cannot exist without the leaves, without the branches, without the trunk, without the roots. But when flowers are there, don’t be bothered to compare them with the roots. Then you will find great contradictions, inconsistencies.\nThere are. What is consistent between the roots and the flower? What is consistent between the branches and the leaves and the flower? The leaves may be green and the flower is red – so contradictory, so inconsistent! The roots are ugly, the flower is so beautiful – what is consistent? But when the flowers are there, you know perfectly well that those roots underground are the base. The trunk, the branches are moving – a movement towards the flowers, the leaves. They all help the flower.\nI have lived in many places, but I don’t own any house. I am a houseless wanderer. I have always been a guest of somebody. But wherever I have been, I have created beautiful gardens.\nIn one place the land was big. It was impossible for just me alone to make the whole land green. I searched for a gardener, the best – because less than that does not satisfy me. This gardener was receiving awards every year, because every year there was a competition to see who brings the biggest flowers, the most beautiful. From the whole province people were participating, but this old man, a poor gardener, had been getting the first prize for years. I asked him, “Would you love to be with me and be my gardener?”\nHe had never lived in such a big bungalow – he was a poor man. He was very happy, he had never had such a big piece of land. And I said, “All the facilities will be provided, you don’t be worried. Whatever salary you want, you just say. It is up to you to decide.”\nA poor man, he said, “Thirty rupees per month would be enough.”\nI said, “No. Thirty rupees for a man who creates so much beauty? Sixty will be okay.” He could not\nbelieve me, he thought I was mad – and perhaps he was right.\nSixty rupees in those days was a great salary; the headmaster of a school or the head clerk of a big government office was getting it. And I was alone in the big bungalow. I said, “You take as many rooms of this bungalow as you want – free of charge. I am a guest, I don’t pay anything; you are my guest, there is no problem. And every facility that you need for the garden will be provided. Go and find out, purchase all beautiful plants, flowers, trees, and make this barren land”\nIt had remained barren for many years, because somehow the rumor spread that the house was haunted. The owner could not sell it. Who is going to purchase a haunted house? The owner was very nervous when he offered it to me – he loved me. And I said, “That’s perfectlythat is a beautiful\nbuilding” – it was Victorian architecture – “I would love it.”\nHe thought perhaps I didn’t know that the house was haunted. He said, “But one thing I have to say to you – I don’t want to keep you in the dark – the house has been empty for years, and nobody purchases it, nobody rents it, because the whole city know the house is haunted.”\nI said, “That’s great! In such a big house, to live alone does not feel good. If a few ghosts are there, it\nwill be good company.”\nThe gardener brought all kinds of plants and flowers, and he started working, because in the next competition he had to bring the greatest rose flowers. But what did he do? On each rosebush he went on cutting the buds. He would leave only one bud and cut all the other buds.\nWhen I came to know of it, I said, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “This is the only way to bring the biggest flowers, because then all the juices of the tree start\nmoving into one flower to make it blossom. If there are many flowers, then the juices are divided.”\nI said, “You forget about your annual exhibition. From now onwards I will give you the award for not cutting a single bud! It is not important that the rose should be big, it is enough that it is a rose. And you are being murderous.”\nI wanted to make it clear to you that the roses are there, but the juice is flowing from the roots.\nWhatever I have said in these thirty years – and I have been speaking continuously, except for those few years when I was silent – every single word is important, because they are all interconnected. You may find contradictions, you may find inconsistencies. Don’t be afraid; life is full of contradictions, full of inconsistencies. And I don’t know any other god than life itself.\nI have never said that my books of the past are not important. But this goes on happening: I say one thing, you hear something else. I have said only that what I am saying now is the highest flower on the that I have been growing for thirty years. So if you have to decide, decide on this moment’s statement, and don’t be bothered about inconsistencies, contradictions.\nAnd I have also said, remember this for tomorrow also. Tomorrow this day will be old, gone. Newer flowers will be blossoming. Be always in the present, and you will be always right. And don’t be afraid when tomorrow you find an even better thing. Then don’t cling to the yesterday. It was beautiful, but it was beautiful yesterday.\nIt makes a very important implication clear. Why do people worship dead saints, prophets, messiahs? They are very convenient; because they are dead you can rest assured that they are not going to change their statements. While they are alive you are always trembling – the man may say something else tomorrow.\nIt is your incapacity to change, incapacity to remain a flow, that makes you worship Jesus Christ when I am here! But Jesus Christ is convenient – you can be certain about him. Not only that, you can read whatsoever you want to read in his statements; he is not going to say to you, “This is not what I said.”\nAll these theologians of different religions around the world, what are they doing? They are making you more and more comfortable with the religion you are addicted to. Yes, I use the word “addiction,” because all religions are nothing but drugs. The theologians go on polishing, making the statements more suitable to you. This you cannot expect here.\nI don’t say anything considering you, I say it because it is true! If it hurts you, I am helpless. If it does not suit you, disturbs you, it is your problem; I have nothing to do with it. My concern is to remain flowing with existence, life, truth. And whatever existence wants to speak through me, I will speak.\nI never hesitate to contradict myself, because who am I to interfere? It was a life force that said that, the same life force is saying this. There must be some inner connection which you cannot see.\nMy books of the past are important, because they will be a test for you – whether you can grow with me or you have stopped long ago.\nIt happened... a beautiful man, George Gurdjieff, had a great disciple, P.D. Ouspensky. Nobody knew about Gurdjieff, but the whole world know about Ouspensky, because Ouspensky was one of the best mathematicians the world has ever known. Gurdjieff was a Caucasian... who cares about the Caucasus? He was uneducated, but a tremendous man, really terrific.\nOuspensky was in search of truth. He roamed around the world, he was in India. He was searching for someone in whose eyes he could see that the man knows. He was not looking for beautiful words, theorems – all that he himself was capable of doing. And he searched all over India and Tibet and could not find a man who was a living truth. He found great scholars, he found famous religious leaders, but that was not his search.\nOuspensky was really an authentic seeker. He was searching for a man who was an embodiment of truth, who is not repeating words of some sages who died thousands of years ago, a man who could say, “This is so.” Whether religious scriptures agree with it or not does not matter. If they agree, good for them; if they don’t agree, they are wrong. And strangely enough, he found Gurdjieff in the same town, in the same cafe where he used to go every day after his university classes. He found him in Moscow. Life is very mysterious.\nGurdjieff was just sitting there. And the moment Ouspensky entered and looked at the man – just like a flash, he knew, “This is the man I have been searching here was that light, there was on that face something unknown, mysterious. He fell in deep love with Gurdjieff. But Gurdjieff was just as strange a man as I am. He was not an ordinary scholar; he was not talking about what others have discovered, he was saying only that which he had come to know.\nOuspensky lived with Gurdjieff for many years. Then the first world war came, and Gurdjieff had to escape from Russia; Ouspensky also had to escape. Ouspensky was welcome anywhere, any university would be proud of having him.\nHe had written a book which has become almost the most important book about not only mathematics, but about life and all its problems. He had written a book called TERTIUM ORGANUM – the third canon of knowledge. And in the beginning of the book he writes that the first organum was written by Aristotle. Aristotle has a book named ORGANUM – knowledge, wisdom. And the second book was written by Bacon, NOVUM ORGANUM – the new wisdom. Both are very significant persons in the history of thought. Aristotle is the father of all the logic that the West knows, and Bacon is the father of all the sciences that have developed in the West.\nOuspensky said, “I am writing TERTIUM ORGANUM, the third canon of wisdom, and I declare that\nthe third canon existed even before the first.” And it was not out of any egoism – I have gone through\nall the three canons – it was a simple statement of fact. Ouspensky has transcended Aristotle and Bacon both. The book caused a great stir in the whole world. London University invited him, because Russia was no longer a safe place; the first world war and the communist revolution were going on together.\nGurdjieff was hiding in a very faraway part of Russia, Tiflis. It was almost another planet from London. And he asked Ouspensky to drop everything and come back to Tiflis. Ouspensky loved the man so much, he dropped his job, he dropped his work. He had opened a school in which he was teaching Gurdjieff’s message. He closed the school and went into a dangerous country where life was not safe. He arrived in Tiflis, and the moment he entered Gurdjieff’s room, Gurdjieff said, “Good, you have arrived. Now go back and resume your work.”\nThis was too much. Even Ouspensky, a man of such integrity, could not stand it. But Gurdjieff’s methods, devices were such. This was a moment of test, a test of trust. Ouspensky failed in that moment. He thought Gurdjieff was simply insane: “I wasted everything that I had arranged, traveled in a country where any moment I could have been killed – and he does not even say, ‘Sit down, rest.’ He says, ‘Good that you have come. Now just go back and resume your work.’”\nHe went back. Gurdjieff had impressed him immensely, so what did he do? He dropped Gurdjieff, but he could not drop the Gurdjieff with whom he had lived for years, or his teachings. A strange phenomenon happened. For him Gurdjieff was divided into two parts. He continued to teach only that part of Gurdjieff that was in tune with his logical mind. Beyond that, Gurdjieff was his enemy.\nGurdjieff lived long, longer than Ouspensky. Ouspensky continued to teach Gurdjieff’s teachings, but\nthose were the old teachings up to the point where Ouspensky dropped out of the fold of Gurdjieff.\nIt is difficult to be with a living message, because the message goes on moving in tune with existence. It does not bother about you. You have to keep yourself running with the message, you have to forget all about what was said in the past. The new, the latest, is always the right. And it does not mean that what has preceded it was not important. Without it this new phenomenon would not have been there at all.\nIn my thirty years’ life of talking from my heart to people, thousands have come and gone. They still love me, but only up to the point when they departed. After that they say, “Something has gone wrong.”\nJust the other day I heard about Amitabh – one of my sannyasins, very much loved and respected by the commune. He just dropped sannyas a few months ago and he is telling people, “Osho was right up to the moment I left. Now he has fallen from his enlightenment.” Great idea! Nobody has ever heard that anybody can fall from enlightenment. Amitabh has all the credit for finding something new.\nBut it is absolutely idiotic – there is no way to fall from enlightenment. Once you have known, there is no way to become ignorant again. It is very difficult from ignorance to move towards wisdom. It is very difficult – but only difficult, not impossible. To come back down from wisdom to ignorance is impossible. It is just not the law of life.\nPeople, thousands of people, have walked along with me, but they go only so far and stop. They were not coming along with me; they were really finding nourishment for their own rubbish, knowledge. The moment they found that I was saying something that went against their knowledge, their religion, their party line, their ideology, they stopped. They departed.\nIf you ask them, they will say, “Yes, there was a time when Osho was right. He is no longer right.” But this is natural. Only a person who has immense capacity to change, to go on and on, can find the truth of life. And once you have found it there is no way to lose it, because you find it in the very innermost being of yourself. You are it! How can you drop it somewhere? How can you forget about it?\nBut the disciple who stops at a certain point certainly has to console himself, that “Up to this point Osho was right. After that, he has gone wrong.” He does not know that right is not a static thing, it is a growing phenomenon.\nYou are very comfortable with Jesus – and he was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew, he died as a Jew. He never heard the word “Christian.” He was unaware even of the word “Christ,” because the word “Christ” is Greek. He knew only one language, Aramaic; he was not even acquainted with Hebrew. Aramaic was a local language of ordinary people; Hebrew was the language of the priests, of the high-class people. Aramaic is just a common form of Hebrew. In Hebrew and Aramaic there is no word like “Christ,” the word is “messiah.”\nHis own people, the Jews, could not accept Jesus as a messiah, because he was saying things that were disturbing them. His common way of talking was, “It has been told to you in the past, an eye for an eye. But I say unto you, if somebody slaps you on one cheek, give him the other cheek also.” He was contradicting the old prophets. This was not acceptable to his people.\nJesus alive was crucified. Dead, he has the biggest following in the world. This is a miracle. When he was living, nobody wanted to be associated with him. Dead, even those who are not Christians, like Mahatma Gandhi, Hazrat Mohammed – one is a Hindu, another is a Mohammedan – are ready to accept him as a prophet. It is easier now. He has stopped; you can manage to go up to the stoppage.\nWith me you will find it difficult – until I die. And don’t hope that I am going to die soon. I am going to disturb you as much as possible. If you can manage to live with a living message, and if you have the guts to go on changing with the living message, you are blessed. Many will come around me, but only a few will remain. Yes, after my death many more will come, and everybody will remain!\nYour mind is somehow very stubborn about changing, because change brings difficulties. Change brings new things, and you have to begin again and again and again. But be courageous. If you are not courageous you are already dead. Just to go on breathing is not enough to be alive. I define life as a constant change, and the capacity to go with it wherever it leads you. If you have that courage, truth is not far away. Only the courage is missing.\nYou are asking me, that I have said that my old books are not important You want to divide me in two\nparts – my old books, and my present message to you – so that you can choose. I will not allow you such a convenient way.\nMy old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you will not be able to understand me. But remember, it is a constant flow and change, so don’t be bothered with inconsistencies, contradictions.\nIf you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then you can see, crystal-clear, that it is a single message from the roots to the flower. It is a single organism.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nA FEW MONTHS BACK YOU SAID, “IF THIS IS BAD LAND USE, THEN YOUR LAND USE LAWS ARE BOGUS, AND THEY SHOULD BE BURNED.”\nWALDEN KIRSCH, KGW TELEVISION CHANNEL 8 NEWS, HAS SAID, “THE OREGON SUPREME COURT RULED THIS MORNING THAT RAJNEESHPURAM IS INDEED A LEGAL CITY. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE CITY FOR THEIR COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE, AND TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION, RAJNEESHISM.” WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?\nI do not care what the Supreme Court decides. This is the only legal city in the whole world. There is no crime here, no rape, no theft, no murder. Even in the middle of the night any woman can go anywhere in the darkness without any fear. It is not a question – whether this city is legal or not.\nI have known many cities. People are living there side by side, but they are not together. Those cities are just like a crowd, not a living organism.\nThis city is a totally new phenomenon. It is a living organism. People are not just a crowd here; they have chosen to be part, a living part of the whole. There are no families in this city, this whole city is a family! You cannot find this phenomenon anywhere else. Families are small units keeping themselves separate from other families, fighting with their neighbors – you know.\nJesus had two things to say: “Love your enemy as you love yourself.” That is not great, many have said it, but the second thing is really great. He said, “Love your neighbor just as you love yourself.” And that is very difficult to do. Have you ever heard of neighbors loving each other? Not only ordinary neighbors, but great leaders, religious masters – they too cannot stand the neighbor.\nI have heard A rabbi and a Christian bishop lived in one neighborhood. Their houses were\nopposite each other, and they were continuously hating, being jealous, competing about everything.\nThe bishop purchased a Buick car; that almost caused a heart attack in the rabbi. In the morning the bishop was pouring water on the Buick. The rabbi could not contain himself. He asked, “What are you doing?”\nThe bishop said, “I am doing a baptism. The car is being transformed into a Christian car. This was more trouble. The rabbi could not sleep. Somehow he managed, and the next day purchased a Cadillac. Now it was the turn of the bishop to get a heart attack.\nAnd in the morning the rabbi started to cut the exhaust pipe with big garden scissors. The bishop\ncould not believe what was going on. He said, “What is the matter? What are you doing?” The rabbi said, “I am doing a circumcision – now the car is really Jewish.”\nThis is the only place where you will find people from all over the world – different races, different colors, different languages – becoming one family. We don’t have any neighbor, so we don’t need Jesus’ advice to love your neighbor – we don’t have any.\nBut it is good that the Supreme Court proved itself, proved that there is still hope of democracy in America, that there is a possibility of some fairness. The Supreme Court’s decision is very decisive and very historic in the sense that against all the bigots, against all the politicians, against all the pressures, they still remained true to the law. The decision must rejoice you, for the simple reason that it shows we are not in the Soviet Union.\nAmerica should think over this decision, and try to remain democratic whatsoever the consequences, because this is the only country that holds any hope for humanity.\nRajneeshpuram was legal – it would have remained legal even without the decision of the Supreme Court. We were going to fight to the very end, because it is not only a question of a small commune; it is a question of the very spirituality of this nation.\nPoliticians are nothing but pollution. As a democracy becomes purer and purer, more and more does the pressure of the politicians become insignificant. Democracy comes to its uttermost flowering when politicians disappear completely.\nOur fight will continue, because those cunning politicians who were trying to destroy this city – just because we want to live in our own way, and we want to think in our own way, and we want not to be led by those idiots – they will go on trying other ways to harass you. But nobody can harass my people, because to harass somebody two parties are needed: one who harasses and one who becomes harassed. We are not going to become harassed. We have nothing to lose, nothing to fear – who fears dead people? Their cities are nothing but cemeteries, legal cemeteries!\nI must thank the Supreme Court on behalf of all of you, that it has saved so many innocent people from getting utterly disappointed.\nNow we can grow – because in my vision, I have always seen the commune consisting of at least 100,000 sannyasins. And it is going to happen! No evil politicians can stop it happening. We are going to make this place, which was just a desert, green, full of rejoicings, songs and dances. I want Rajneeshpuram to become the Garden of Eden.\nYou will see God one day – if there is any God – knocking on your doors: “Please let me come in!”\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS BEYOND REBELLION, BEYOND ALONENESS, BEYOND MEDITATION?\nYou!\nNext question. Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS A GOOD SANNYASIN?\nI have never come across one, because it is a contradiction. A good sannyasin – what do you mean? Can there be a bad sannyasin too? To be a sannyasin is to be goodness itself.\nOkay. Question 6 BELOVED OSHO,\nIF ENLIGHTENMENT MEANS TO BE BEYOND ALL DUALITIES, NOT CHOOSING, THEN WHY ARE YOU AGAINST WARS, POLITICS AND OTHER STUPIDITIES OF MANKIND?\nYes, enlightenment means choicelessness – but you are not enlightened yet. For me there is no choice. If the third world war comes, I will be just the same as I am. If the whole world is destroyed, it won’t change anything in me – neither my bliss, nor my peace, nor my love.\nBut for you.… Because you are not enlightened, I have been talking against wars, against superstitions, against stupidities. I am not speaking to myself – do you think I am crazy? – I am talking to you. And for you there is at every step a choice. Till you come to the moment of enlightenment and choicelessness, you will have to choose; before that there is no other way.\nIt is just as a blind man carries a stick in his hand, groping for his way. But if his eyes are cured, will he still grope with the stick? He will throw the stick away.\nWhatever I am saying to you is just giving you a stick till you are ready to open your eyes. Then, throw the stick. Then there is nothing good, nothing bad. Then whatever the enlightened person does is right. And there is no question of choice, because he can see. He does not choose. Choice implies thinking. He does not think, he simply sees his way and moves on it.\nMy work is arduous. I have to speak from a point to you, who are almost on another planet; the distance is vast. Remove the distance. Of course I am not going to move close to you. The thirsty goes to the well, not vice versa.\nI am here, available. If you are thirsty, move closer to me. And soon you will know that light, that insight, that explosion of bliss in which there is no choice.\nEnlightenment is choicelessness. But don’t misunderstand me. Before that, you will have to move very cautiously, choosing the right against the wrong, choosing the truer so that you can reach to the ultimate truth.\nCHAPTER 12\nDoubt: the methodology of the seeker\n10 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD SWAMI PREMANAM SAYABOUTTHE DISCOURSESTHATTHEYARE BORING, HE DOES NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM; THAT DISCOURSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME, AND HE PREFERS WORKERS’ DARSHAN.\nCOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nAnam is a confirmed creep. But what he is saying has much truth in it – not because the discourses are boring, but because he is not here. Physically he is here, but his mind is roaming all over the place. Perhaps he may be hearing, but he is not listening to me.\nThese discourses are my heart. I am opening myself to you, revealing to you finally and exactly what I am. But there are people like Anam who are not interested in this revelation. Then the thing appears boring. But I am puzzled – if it is boring you, who is forcing you to be here? Are you sitting here to torture yourself? I am not at all interested whether you are here or not. If the discourses are boring, then you must be enjoying your boredom. And boredom is not in the discourses, because you are the only one who is bored.\nLook at these people! Raise your hands, those who are not bored – both hands!\nAnam, have you seen these hands? You are a bored person, utterly bored. You don’t have the\npatience even to understand what I am saying. Are you British by chance?\nI have heard that whenever a joke is told, the French understand it immediately. Their laughter is an immediate response. The British laugh twice: first, when they hear the joke – not that they have understood the joke, but just to be polite, not to offend you in any way. And the second time, in the middle of the night they laugh again: they have got it.\nThe Germans never laugh. And the Jews... if you tell a joke to a Jew, he will not laugh, he will say to you, “This joke is very old, and moreover you are telling it all wrong!” It is the same joke, but different people are reacting differently.\nWhat I am saying is the same for all of you, but everybody is interpreting it in his own way. Most of you are rejoiced, your hearts are open to me. Your ears are not only hearing; behind your ears you are silently listening to me. How can you be bored? But Anam is bored. The whole credit goes to himself, I am not responsible for it. And why does he go on dragging himself here everyday – to be bored? Perhaps he is some kind of masochist, he wants to be bored.\nThe question is significant, because I am the first person in the whole history of human consciousness whose people are allowed to have a hearty laugh in the temple. Otherwise in temples, churches, mandirs, you go with a long face, looking very serious. This mandir does not belong to those traditional temples and churches and synagogues. This is a place of rejoicing, and if you are unable to rejoice, don’t come. Do something else, don’t waste your time.\nYou are saying your time is wasted, Anam. Your whole life is wasted. What have you done? Your whole life – just have a look backwards – has been a wastage. What flowers have blossomed in you? It is really your whole life, dry, dull, boring, which has made you incapable of enjoying. And if you are not coming here, how are you going to use your time so that it is not wasted? What are you going to do?\nHere there is a chance that perhaps you may awake one day and start growing. Then the time will not be wasted. Of course, in your sleep you may have thought it was wasted, but when you wake up you will be grateful.\nBut don’t come here. And remember always, I am a very unreliable man, as unreliable as nature, particularly here in Rajneeshpuram – the weather changes so quickly. If you feel bored, it is not unimaginable for me to just leave this podium forever. But remember, all these people will suffer because of you.\nI said just the other day that I am not going to be silent, but that was the other day. If anybody is bored, I am not interested in boring anybody, I can just now stop speaking forever. But it looks very undemocratic to me, that just because of one idiot, my whole people around the world will miss my word.\nSo you have to decide, Anam. If you come here, get in tune with me, with what I am saying; otherwise, there is no need to come here. Our commune is a family of totally free individuals. You have decided on your own to be part of it. You can leave not only the Mandir you can leave the commune, and we will rejoice.\nAnd you are saying you enjoyed in the past years the silent satsang with the sannyasins. I am\namazed at people’s stupidity. You cannot remain silent for two minutes! We had satsang on the\nsixth, and I got so fed up with your insensitivity that I have dropped it forever. In the future there will be no silent satsang in the morning... because we were playing music and then there would be a gap – just a little gap of two minutes. We would do the humming and then there would be a gap of two minutes.\nDevaraj was quoting some words from my past expressions to remind you of what I am saying. I have been sowing the seeds for a long time. You cannot see in the seed the flower. He was quoting the seeds to make it clear to you that those same seeds have come to a flowering, and they are going to flower more and more. After his quotation there was again two minutes’ silence.\nAnd what were you doing, Anam, in those silent periods? I saw people coughing all over the place. That coughing is absolutely psychological. Why are you not coughing now? I will speak for two hours and you will not cough a single time. And in those two minutes of silence, not one person, but everybody was coughing. Coughing has something to do with your psychology. One man coughs, and it is infectious, suddenly you realize that your throat is also ready.\nWhile the music was there, you were engaged with the music. While you were humming, you were engaged in humming. The most difficult parts were those few moments of silence. Either you were coughing all over the place – suddenly the Mandir became Koran Grove – or you were laughing, which was disrespectful to the Mandir, to the commune. After music, after humming, an intelligent person will fall into a deeper silence; that is the purpose of that music. But no, you start laughing. The reason is, you cannot stand to be in silence for two minutes.\nAnd now, Anam, you are asking for silent satsang. And I know you more than you know yourself. You may think yourself a wise guy, but you are simply crazy. You think you are a therapist – you need therapy.\nAnd there may be a few other creeps who have crept into the commune. It is good if they get lost forever. A single rotten fish will spread its rottenness to other fish in the pond. And people in this commune are so close to each other, so intimate with each other, that anything contagious affects not only one person, it affects the whole commune. That’s why I don’t call it an organization. It is not, it is an organism, just as your body is an organism, not an organization.\nIf your body were an organization, scientists would have been immensely happy, because then if you had a fracture in your leg, the whole leg could be unscrewed – you would just have to go to the workshop and they could screw on a new leg. If your head was going cuckoo, you could go the workshop and they could change it. But man is not a mechanism put together, man is an organism. Everything in man is connected with everything else; the whole body is functioning in tremendous harmony.\nThis commune is an organism.\nI don’t want any bored person here. You will be immensely benefited – become a Catholic priest, then your boredom will pay you. Here, you will just look out of place.\nAnd I am not saying this only to Anam I had given you the name Anam – anam means anonymous,\nnameless – because when I gave you sannyas I could see in your eyes that you were not an\norganism functioning in beautiful silent harmony: you are a cuckoo. But I give sannyas to anybody – even to cuckoos, hoping against hope that perhaps just through your being near me a miracle may happen.\nAnd when I am talking to you, do you understand the process of talking in deep love and intimacy? Perhaps you are not aware. You love a person – you want to touch the person, hug the person, kiss the person. Why do you do all these things? To get as close to the person as possible. I cannot hug millions of people. Before they have stopped hugging me, I will be dead. Kissing to me is unhygienic.\nI can touch you only with my words. It is a touching experience, far superior to the ways you know of touching each other. A word is a bridge. If you allow yourself to become part of the communion, you cannot be bored; you will be in immense rejoicing, you will be blissful.\nBut nobody can force you to be blissful. Why get miserable sitting here? Do something that makes you happy. And I don’t know what makes you happy. If my words cannot make you happy, then take it for granted that at least in this life you are not going to be happy.\nIt is a great art to be blissful. One has to learn it.\nBecome more and more organic.\nAnd when I am speaking, I am speaking; you are silent. The moment I stop speaking, you start yakketty-yak, yakketty-yak; your mind starts going round and round. You are not listening to me, Anam, that’s why you feel bored. You are bored with yourself. In not listening to me, you are simply listening to your own mind, and you know your mind perfectly well. If you are listening to me, then your mind stops. Then who can be bored? And how?\nI have heard about a man who was sitting in a chair in a waiting room on the railway station. Many other people were also waiting in the waiting room. They all became interested in this man, because what he was doing appeared very strange. Sometimes he would smile for no reason at all. Sometimes he would burst into laughter. Sometimes he would throw away something which was not there, but his hands, his face, expressed the idea that he wanted to get rid of something. He was saying, “No, no” – not in words, in gestures.\nThe whole waiting room fell into silence. What was this man doing? And he looked rich, well- dressed, educated. Finally one man got up to ask him, “What are you doing? – because we are getting more and more curious. Now it is too much; and the train is late – we will have to watch you for at least two hours more. It is becoming mysterious.”\nThe man said, “There is nothing mysterious. I was just telling jokes to myself. And whenever I came across an old joke, I threw it away – I have heard it so many times. When something really juicy comes into my mind, there is a smile. Sometimes just a smile is not enough, the joke is so wonderful that I burst out into laughter. But all this I am doing to myself. How are you concerned? You do your work.”\nAnam, if you are bored, you are doing it to yourself. Please stop doing it.\nWhat I am saying to you is of the utmost importance, because it is a way of touching, but more subtle and sophisticated. A word comes out of my heart, travels to you, and if you are available, reaches exactly into your heart. Neither holding hands can do it, nor even kissing can do it – even French kissing! Not even making love can do it. Making love is a also a way of getting close, so close that you are in each other. But what a communion can do, even lovemaking cannot do.\nGenitals meeting is not a great meeting. It is the lowest form of meeting – even buffalos are doing it. Only man is capable, at the highest sophisticated level, of touching your very heart.\nAnd if you cannot understand my words, forget forever the idea that you will be able to understand my silence. Even while I am speaking, it is there. I am not an orator, I am not a speaker. That’s why, speaking a word, just in the middle of the sentence I will stop, will give a gap; in that gap I am trying to reach you through silence.\nDon’t just listen to my words, listen also to the gaps. And any orator will think that I am strange; this is not the way to speak. But I am not interested in speaking, I am trying to contact you in thousands of ways.\nMy talk is full of silence. If you sort it out, in two hours you will certainly find for half an hour I have been silent. And it is a far deeper silence, because the word makes you listen to me, and then comes the silent period. In that silent period you are waiting for me to complete the sentence.\nAnd this cannot be done – I never do a thing – it is a happening. I cannot speak in another way, because my purpose will be fulfilled only by words followed by wordlessness.\nAnam, I love you as I love everybody. Just think of it – I go on throwing flowers on you, and you go on throwing mud on me? My own people saying to me that my talk is boring?\nMy talk is so full of silence. Listen to both, and it is easier. After a big storm there is a deep silence following it. This is the law of nature: day follows night, life is followed by death, word follows wordlessness. On both sides.… Then it is not a discourse, not oratory; it is a way of reaching you, touching you at the very innermost center of your being.\nBut if you are still bored, then just get up and get out, and get lost. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAY A SKEPTIC CANNOT BE A DISCIPLE, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT YOU NEVER WANT US TO STOP DOUBTING. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SKEPTICISM AND DOUBT.\nThere is a great difference between doubt and skepticism. Not only is there a difference, they are diametrically opposite to each other.\nSkepticism is already a religion, a belief, a conclusion; it is a negative type of conclusion. The skeptic\nhas no philosophy of his own to contribute; all he does is argue against anybody else’s ideology. But\ndon’t ask about his ideology, he has none. He has become a big no, he has become negativity. He\ndoes not believe in anything – but this is also a belief.\nFor example, he does not believe in God. We call him an unbeliever, but it is not right to say that he does not believe in God; he believes that there is no God. It is a belief. Because it is negative you are confused. The theist believes in God; the skeptic does not believe in God, but he is not a seeker, he is not creative, he is not positive. He is not searching for the truth.\nIn ancient Greece there was a school, before Socrates, called the Sophists. They were skeptical people. They had nothing to offer, and they had everything, every argument, every weapon to destroy.\nIt is very easy to say no. To say yes is very difficult.\nYou can say no to anything. If somebody says, “Look at the beautiful sunset,” you can say, “I can see the sun is setting, but I don’t see that there is anything beautiful. Prove to me what beauty is. How can you dare to call this sunset beautiful? Unless you define beauty, you cannot call anything beautiful.”\nAnd beauty has escaped definition. For thousands of years people have tried to define beauty, to define truth, to define love, but no effort has succeeded, for the simple reason that these things are experiences; you cannot explain them. But if you want to explain them away there is no difficulty.\nThe skeptic has already settled in his “no” attitude towards everything. The man is not different from\nany other believer; they have all settled. None of them is on the way to seek.\nNow you can understand the difference and the diametrical opposition between doubt and skepticism. Doubt is not a conclusion, doubt is the beginning of a journey, a pilgrimage. The skeptic has arrived and found as an answer, no – to everything, everything that cannot be placed in front of him, on the table, so he can dissect it.\nKarl Marx has said,“Unless I can see God in a test-tube, in a scientific lab, being dissected, I am not going to believe in him.”\nGod is not to be discovered in a test-tube, God has to be searched for. Of course when you begin to search you will have to doubt thousands of things until you arrive at a point where your doubt disappears. Suddenly you are face to face with reality. You will be amazed: you will not find a God, and at the same time you cannot deny that you have found something, something which is even higher than God. I call it godliness.\nDoubt is the methodology of the seeker. Doubt sharpens your intelligence. It is a challenge. You are neither saying yes, nor are you saying no. You are saying only one thing, “I am ignorant, and I am not going to trust unless I have experienced, whatsoever the case, unless I arrive at something which is indubitable – howsoever I make the effort to doubt it, my doubt goes on failing.”\nThe reality is so vast, overwhelming, so tangible, so real, that even this so-called real world, compared to that reality, looks like a dream.\nDoubt is something of tremendous significance. Only those who have doubted to the very end have found what truth is, what love is, what silence is, what beauty is. Skepticism finds nothing. It is utterly empty, but it makes much noise. Empty drums make much noise. And you cannot argue with a skeptic because he will go on saying no to anything, to any value which you cannot place as an object before him.\nBut doubt – of course, it is a long way and a hard way – goes on eliminating all that is not true. Ultimately only that which is true remains. And nobody can deny truth when one is facing it, experiencing it. Out of that experience comes yes: “Yes, Osho, yes.”\nIt is not a belief. You have searched, gone into great anxiety, anguish, despair. There were many moments when you wanted to stop, because it looked as if the journey was endless. It is not. There is an end; you just have to keep yourself going.\nDoubt is surgical – it goes on cutting all that is absurd. But finally the real remains, unclouded. Doubt removes the clouds.\nThe skeptic says no to the sun because it is clouded; he cannot see the sun. He comes immediately to the conclusion that there is no sun, no light. The doubter removes all the clouds, cuts his way through the clouds. Not that he believes that there is something behind them – there may be nothing – but he has to know whatever is behind the clouds. And everybody who has gone far has ended with truth. It needs guts.\nThe skeptic is a poor man, just like the theists, just like all the so-called religious people in the world. Skepticism is a negative side, it is a negative religion. There is no difference between a skeptic and a believer; they both agree that there is no need for search. One believes there is a sun behind the clouds, another believes there is nothing behind the clouds. But nobody is ready to take the long journey, to pass through all kinds of nightmares, and to reach behind the clouds. Few have reached.\nI teach you doubt, I don’t teach you skepticism. And remember, doubt is not skepticism; it is search, it is seeking.\nBefore Socrates, this school of skeptical people was called Sophism. They were traveling teachers, wandering teachers. They used to take a big fee, much money, to make you a sophist. A sophist is one who can take any side, he does not care for truth. If you pay him good money, he will be on your side. Or, if the opposite side pays him big money, he will be on the opposite side. As far as he is concerned he knows nothing, but he knows the art of argumentation.\nI have heard In a small church in a small town, the priest was very much disturbed by an old man.\nBut the old man was the richest man in his congregation. He had donated much – in fact he had built the church. He was paying the salary of the priest, of course. He used to sit just in the front row in front of the priest, but he was old and always went to sleep. The sleep was not disturbing to the priest, but he snored – and really loud. The priest was disturbed because the old man was disturbing the whole congregation, and the congregation was disturbed because he was disturbing everybody’s sleep!\nFinally the congregation said to the priest, “Something has to be done. This old man disturbs you – just in front somebody snoring, and loudly. And this old man disturbs our sleep also.”\nPeople in Christian countries remain awake late on Saturday night because tomorrow is Sunday, they can rest. And early in the morning they have to go to church. Perhaps they have not slept the whole night – and church is the best place to sleep.\nSo they said, “We come early in the morning just to have a good nap, and this idiot wakes everybody. Rather than listening to your sermon, we listen to his snoring – so please do something!”\nThe priest thought. The old man used to come with one of his grandsons, a small boy; he used to sit\nby his side. The priest thought, “Perhaps the boy can be bribed.”\nHe talked to the boy and he said, “I will give you one dollar every Sunday if you go on waking the old man. Just with your hand go on hitting him so he remains awake. The moment he snores you start hitting. I will give you one dollar.”\nThe boy said, “Good. There is no problem, I will not let him sleep anymore.”\nAnd the next Sunday was beautiful. Everybody slept. The priest repeated the same sermon that he had been... he had three or four sermons ready. And the boy went on hitting the old man with his hand.\nThe old man said, “What nonsense! What are you doing continually?”\nThe boy laughed, but he did not allow the old man to sleep or snore.\nOutside, the old man asked, “What is the matter? You disturbed my whole morning. You have to tell\nme.”\nThe boy said, “It is a question of business. The priest has given me one dollar to keep you awake, because you snore.”\nThe old man said, “Don’t be worried; if it is business, I will give you two dollars. Just don’t disturb me the coming Sunday.”\nThe next Sunday came, and the priest was puzzled. He looked at the boy many times, blinked at the boy that the old man had started snoring, but the boy sat silently smiling. Nobody could sleep. Somehow the priest finished the sermon, took the boy aside and asked, “What happened? Don’t you want the dollar?”\nHe said, “What can I do? It is a question of business.” The priest asked, “What business?”\nHe said, “The old man has promised to give me two dollars. Now it is up to you.”\nOf course the poor priest knew that he could not win in competition with that old man. If he gave three dollars – which was too much for a poor priest – the old man would give four. He was bound to lose completely by this strategy. The boy was not interested – he was not interested in the priest, he was not interested in the congregation, he was not interested in the old man. It was a sheer question of business.\nThat was the attitude of the sophists. Even kings used to send their sons, who were going to become kings of their country someday, to the sophists to learn the art, so that whatever the case is, you can always manage to win it. There is no question of right and wrong for a sophist; the question is whose argument is stronger.\nBut it happened... a young man came to a very famous sophist teacher. The young man was very rich, and the sophist teacher asked for an enormous amount of money. The young man said, “Don’t be worried, whatever you ask I will give, but on one condition. Half of the money I will pay now and half of the money I will pay to you when I have been victorious in some argument with somebody. That will be the test of whether you have been really teaching me or just exploiting.”\nIt was understandable, and the old sophist teacher knew that there was no problem. “You are going to\nwin against anybody. I am the greatest sophist in the whole of Greece, don’t be worried.”\nHalf the money was paid. After two years the young man was perfectly trained in the art of argumentation; from any side he was able to win. If he chose to support theism he was able to win, if he wanted to support atheism he was able to win. He now had the knack of how to present a case and how to argue about it.\nThe teacher said, “Now your education is finished. Bring the other half of my money that you had\npromised.”\nThe man said, “But I have not yet been a winner. You will have to wait, that was the condition.” And the young man proved far smarter than the great sophist. He never argued with anybody. Whatever you said, he would say yes. But he would never enter into any argument, so the question of winning never arose. One year pased, two years passed – but the old sophist was not going to be cheated in this way. This young man was trying to be really too much.\nThe old man filed a case in the court against the young man, that he had promised to give him half of the money when his education was over and he had not given it. The idea of the great teacher was really marvelous. He thought, “If the court decides,”You will receive half the money only when he wins a case,” I am defeated, the young man has won his first victory.” So he planned that outside the court he would say, “Now you have won your first victory, give me half the money.” But he never got that money, he got defeated in the court.\nHe had thought of the other possibility: if he won the case – although there was no possibility, but he was a great arguer – if he won the case, then too, he would tell the young man, “You are going against the court’s decision, you have to pay the money.” But he had not thought about it – that the young man was his own student, and knew all his tactics.\nThe young man argued perfectly, and in fact the case was clearly stronger on his side: “Until I win my\nfirst argument, I will not pay the other half.” The teacher was not interested in winning the case.\nHe said, “It is certainly true that this was the condition.” He accepted it before the court, hoping that out of the court he would say, “Now”\nHe lost the case, the young man won the case, and after the court on the steps he took hold of the\nyoung man and said, “Boy, now you have won your argument, give me my money.”\nThe young man said, “I am your student – you cannot deceive me. I cannot go against the court’s decision; that would be contempt of court. And if you insist, come back inside the court and ask before the magistrate.”\nThis sophistry has continued down the ages; it has taken many names – now it is called skepticism. The skeptic has no ideology, so you cannot defeat him. He never proposes anything. If he never proposes anything, how can you defeat him? He has no belief system. He is in a far stronger position. You have a belief system; he can find loopholes in it and defeat you.\nThe skeptic is bound to win against anybody who has a system of beliefs. The skeptic gains nothing but only these futile argumentations and victories. And the more he becomes articulate in arguments, the more he is unaware that life is not to argue, life is not to say no, because no means death. And just wasting your life destroying other people’s arguments, what are you going to gain? You wasted your whole life.\nI am not teaching you skepticism, I am teaching you the art of doubt. Doubt does not say that it is not so. The doubt simply says, “I am ignorant. I have not experienced it yet; hence, I will continue to doubt till I achieve the authentic, the real. Then I will be all yes – but not before that.”\nThe man of doubt, only the man of doubt, some day becomes the man of truth. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIF YES AND NO ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE SMALLEST BLADE OF GRASS IS NEEDED AS MUCH AS THE MOST DISTANT STAR, WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THE NEGATIVE RESISTANCE OF THE OREGONIANS TO YOUR VISION? HOW ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND IT?\nI welcome it. The antagonism of the Oregonians is our strength. Their antagonism is a blessing to us. They may be thinking otherwise, but they don’t know how the law of life functions. The more they try to destroy us, the more indestructible this commune will be, because when you had to face opposition, for the first time you bring your intelligence to its highest peak. When you see that so much negativity is around you – you are just a small island and all around is the ocean of Oregonians – it gives you an opportunity to rise to the moment, to face it.\nIt is a well-known fact that even the greatest scientists use only fifteen percent of their intelligence. The average person uses only seven percent of his potential. What is the difference between the ordinary, average person and the scientists? Why does the scientist rise to fifteen percent? Because he has taken upon himself a challenge to find the truth about something.\nHe will be opposed by those dogmatic people who have already come to a conclusion. They will say, “There is no need for you to work on it. We know the answer, it is in THE BIBLE; just read THE BIBLE. One book is enough. It is the holy book; God has given everything that is needed to be known.”\nBut people like Copernicus, Galileo, Columbus, go against THE BIBLE. THE BIBLE says the earth is flat. It looks flat. Science has to rise above the average man’s idea that whatever you see is right. In all the languages there are proverbs which say, “Don’t believe in hearing, believe in seeing.”\nIf you look around you, the earth is flat, because our vision through the eyes in not vast enough, and we are standing on the earth. There is no horizon; it is your limited capacity of vision. When you start losing your eyesight, the horizon comes closer to you; when you become blind, there is no horizon. When you are young, you see the beauty of the horizon. The horizon depends on your eyes, it has nothing to do with the earth. The earth is vast, and man is so tiny and his eyes cannot see so far.\nBut the scientist tries to find whether there is some place where the earth and the sky meet. He doubts your knowledge of the past, he doubts your scriptures. He wants to know it for himself; only then can he be sure. He goes on and on and on, and finds that the horizon is an illusion. There is no place where earth and heaven meet.\nThese scientists first started logically, rationally, to find out what kind of earth is possible, and they decided that it is a globe, not a flat piece of land. It was hypothetical. Columbus experimented on this hypothesis. He was thought to be a madman. But never be afraid – even a madman will find somebody more mad to help.\nIn thirty years, this has been my experience. I am a madman, but I have never been without friends. They are certainly madder than me.\nThe queen of Spain supported Columbus. She said, “What is the harm? I have enough money, he has enough argument. Let him have a chance, let him go for for a journey around the earth. If the earth is a globe, then finally he will come back to the same place from where he started.” It is simple logic: if you move in a circle, you will come back to the same place. “And if the earth is flat, we are not responsible; he is insisting. If the earth is flat, then his ship will finally fall down at the edge of the earth. That is his responsibility, if he goes to hell. For me, it will be just a little loss of money – that does not matter.”\nThen it was a question of finding at least ninety people – three ships were to go, because nobody was clear how long it would take to come back. So much food, clothes for every season, enough people to take these three big ships.\nThe queen said, “Don’t be worried, money can purchase anything,” and she purchased ninety people. They were all Christians; they thought that the earth was flat, but she was giving so much money that they thought, even if the ship fell into utter darkness, they would be leaving enough money for their family, at least for three generations – which they could not manage to earn being here. They could not even manage enough food, enough clothes, shelter. So ninety people were ready and they sailed off.\nThe horizon was there, but again and again it changed its place. Two months and twenty-seven days had passed, and there was the horizon still at the same distance. This proved perfectly that the horizon is an illusion. It is the limitation of our eyesight and our position standing on the earth. You can see the sun is round, you can see the moon is round because you are so far away that you can see the whole thing. But standing on the earth itself you cannot see the whole earth.\nColumbus was immensely happy. But they had taken enough food for only three months. Those ninety people – they were not scientists, they had not come to prove anything; they were just there for money. With their Bibles they still believed that the earth was flat and that Columbus was mad. But they had got so much money, who cared whether he was mad or not?\nBut after two months and twenty-seven days, they became nervous. They were almost having nervous breakdowns: “What is going to happen now? Even if Columbus is right and THE BIBLE is wrong and we are not going to fall off a flat earth, after three days the food will be finished. We will be dying, starving; and that looks far uglier than sudden death. We will die gradually.”\nSo they all gathered – when Columbus was going to sleep – on one ship in the night, and they thought that the only sane course now was, “We have tried to persuade Columbus to let us go back. He is not a man who goes back, he goes only forward. Now we have come to the dangerous point – in three days the food will be finished. So the only way is, to throw Columbus into the ocean, get rid of him. Let him swim and find out the truth – why should we lose our lives? – and we will go back.”\nColumbus, seeing that all ninety people had gathered on one ship – he was just going to sleep, but he was not asleep – he also went there. Hiding, he listened to their decision that he was going to be thrown into the ocean tomorrow. These fools would do it, and he was almost helpless – a single man against ninety people. He came out of hiding, went into the meeting – they were very shocked.\nHe said, “There is no need to be shocked. Your decision is perfectly practical. I just want to make a suggestion. It took us two months and twenty-seven days to reach this place. Do you think in three days you will be back home?” Even those fools could understand; the logic was simple. “You cannot go back in three days. But there is a possibility that in three days we may reach India if we go on and on” – because that was the idea. One route was open to India; going around Africa and reaching India – that route was open. They had been been moving in the opposite direction.\nBut they thought, “If we cannot reach Spain, at least we will reach India.” That was the last known place; between Spain and India was the whole known world. Columbus’ argument was so solid that they decided to go on.\nThat’s how you are going on with me. You cannot go back! We have already broken the bridge. The day you took sannyas, the bridge collapsed. Now you can only go forward.\nAnd I say to you, just as Columbus reached America in three days.… He could not reach India. American was not in his mind; it was unknown, a new land, but he thought he had reached India. That’s why the aboriginal Americans are called Red Indians. It was Columbus who called them Indians.\nIn three days’ time they saw green leaves floating in the ocean, birds flying in the sky. And he said to\nhis men, “Now don’t be afraid. You can see the birds; trees are not very far, you can see the leaves\nfloating in the ocean. The land is not so far, we will reach it in three days. Or even if we have to fast for a few days, we are going to reach.” And strange, within three days they landed.\nThe scientist is not skeptical; he has doubts about the outside world. The truly religious person doubts about the inside world. Both arrive. The point is that you should go on and on till you arrive, because you may stop just one step before.\nColumbus gave them a challenge: “In three days you cannot return. I will allow you, you can go; I will swim, you need not throw me. I will jump into the ocean myself, I will try to reach without you – but remember, all you ninety are going to die, and a cowardly death. Be a little brave, face the situation; come along with me. The earth is round. We have seen in these past days that there is no horizon – we are bound to reach land.”\nThis was a great challenge to their manliness, to their guts, and they agreed with Columbus; otherwise there would have been no America. It was Columbus who doubted THE BIBLE. It was Galileo who doubted THE BIBLE.\nWe are surrounded by fanatical Christians. In America, Oregon is perhaps one of the most backward, fanatical, unprogressive states. I have chosen it knowingly, because here is the challenge. And you need a challenge so that you can become sharp – and you can see it happening.\nWe have in our commune the most intelligent group possible. Just in the law department of the commune there are four hundred sannyasins. There is no firm anywhere in the world which has four hundred legal experts. And there is nothing to lose, we have everything to gain; just remain courageous. And in four years’ time they have not been able to make a dent. A small commune has already taken two cities of Oregon. Wait, more cities will be following! Feel strong – you are, just you have to remember it. And their opposition goes on hitting you, helping you to remember.\nAnd because we are fighting for truth, there may be some small battles in which we are defeated, but the ultimate victory is ours – and it is the ultimate victory that counts. Even the greatest warriors have lost a few small battles. That does not matter. The decision, the judgment of the Supreme Court yesterday, is a victory; it is not a small thing.\nThe whole of Oregon, except for a few intelligent people, is against this commune – for no reason at all. We have not harmed them, we don’t intend to harm anybody. We are so absorbed in ourselves, we don’t care whether Oregon is there or has disappeared!\nThe Supreme Court must have been under great pressure, but they proved that truth cannot be defeated by any pressure – political lies, religious fanaticism, just the animal heritage of being afraid of the new, of the unknown. But the judges could see through all this.\nThere is a group in Oregon, “One Thousand Friends of Oregon” – they were fighting against us. Now, if they have any dignity they should start calling themselves “One Thousand Enemies of Oregon.”\nThe Supreme Court and its judges have to be appreciated. They put aside their Christianity, they put aside the fact that they are Oregonians, they put aside all kinds of rumors and gossip against us, and they tried to see the truth. And it was not a single judge – it was the whole Supreme Court panel. And the decision was not from one man, it was a unanimous decision of the whole Court.\nTruth may take a little time for its recognition, but finally it has to be recognized, for the simple reason that it is true.\nNow, can you believe A city exists here, thousands of people are living here – and for many years it\nhad been a wasteland. And it is not a small piece of property, it is one hundred and twenty-six square miles. It is three times bigger than New York, two times bigger than San Francisco. And this is the only city that has supporters all over the world; otherwise, cities don’t have supporters. It has millions of supporters, sympathizers, lovers.\nIn Oregon itself there are thousands of Oregonians who have every sympathy for you and your commune. But they are afraid of their neighbors, their community. We receive hundred of letters of support, but they don’t want their names to be made public. So it is not that the whole of Oregon is against you, it is only the mob – which has no intelligence.\nLet them be against us. Their being in opposition is going to help us in every possible way. It is not only going to help us, it is going to help democratic values. Our presence here is going to transform the state of Oregon – because truth is a wildfire. Once recognized, it is going to burn all opposition. And it is not only Oregon that I am interested in – it is too small for my interest – we have to awaken the whole of America, so that democracy is not just a word but becomes a reality.\nThe last words of George Gurdjieff were very strange, inconceivable, but they were addressed to you. Dying, he opened his eyes and said, “Bravo, America!” Nobody was expecting it. They were thinking he would give some spiritual guidance departing from the world. And look at him – he says, “Bravo, America”! But he was not addressing them, he was addressing you, he was addressing me. He was able to have a vision; he was one of the enlightened masters of this century.\nAmerica is certainly the very hope for the whole world, but not the way it is now. Its hypocrisy has to be exposed, and it has to be made aware: you are not fighting against Soviet Russia, you are fighting against fascism, nazism, all the anti-democratic values. You are fighting for individual freedom. Your fight is not just a war against the Soviet Union, your fight is far more valuable.\nWe are fighting for the New Man to be born, and the New Man can be born only in the new world.\nAmerica is the latest discovery of humanity; that’s why it is called the New World.\nOld countries have traditions, conventions; their past is heavy. it is very difficult for them to get rid of it. America has no past– three hundred years is not much of a past. India has been there, according to Hindu scholars, for ninety thousand years. India can say she has a past – ninety thousand years! It is very difficult in India to make a man free from the programming that has been going on for ninety thousand years. It is easier in America to deprogram people because they don’t have much – only three hundred years.\nWe have to deprogram America from dirty politics, from fanatic religions, from all kinds of hypocrisy. It is not a coincidence that suddenly we have landed here. In nature, in existence, nothing happens\naccidentally. We have to do something really great for humanity’s sake.\nGurdjieff was right: Bravo, America!\nCHAPTER 13\nSympathy is a dirty word\n11 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nYESTERDAY, THE WHOLE DAY I SAW MANY SANNYASINS GIVE SYMPATHY TO SWAMI PREM ANAM AFTER YOUR DISCOURSE. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nSympathy is not compassion; it is just the opposite. Sympathy is a kind of exploitation of the other person. When you sympathize with somebody, you are higher, better, and the other is lower, falling, degraded. Your ego gets immense satisfaction out of sympathy. But this is how the unconscious mind functions. You don’t know exactly what you are doing.\nThese sannyasins who sympathized with Anam must have been the same people who had raised their hands here against him. Now, this is strange. You raise your hands against him, and then you start feeling a little guilty. When you see him, you want to compensate for the guilt, so you hug him. And it is an enjoyable moment for you, because the other is in need of your sympathy. You are the giver, the other is the beggar.\nIf a few of you did it to Anam, it was ugly, inhuman, against the dignity of an individual. You should have given him your compassion. In the dictionaries they mean the same, but not in actual life.\nCompassion means making the other aware that he is going astray, that what he has done is not good. You are not putting him down, you are trying to raise him up. You are not saying, “You are alright as you are,” you are making it clear: “Something is wrong in your attitude, and being your\nfriend, being part of the commune, it is our duty to draw your attention to it, so that you can drop that\nattitude.”\nNobody is right or wrong, only attitudes. And attitudes can be dropped, changed. If you were really compassionate you would have made it more clear to him again and again, all over the commune, wherever he went. It should have been emphasized, “Your attitude is wrong, and you are capable of dropping the attitude. We are in total support of you, we love you, that’s why we want you to drop the attitude.”\nWhy did I waste my time on Anam? Do you think I was criticizing him? Do you think I was saying anything against him? Then you have missed the point. I love the person, but he can be even more lovable. I love the person, that’s why I pointed out to him that his attitude will hinder his growth. Yes, it looks a little hard. But only love can be hard, because only love can change you.\nYour sympathy was phony, because here you were raising your hands, and with those same hands you were hugging Anam. Either your raising the hands was phony, or hugging Anam was phony. You should not have double faces, that here you show one mask before me, and when you meet Anam you show another mask. Stop this stupid game, because in this game you are the loser, a person who is not integrated, who is not one.\nCircumstances may change, but an integrated person remains centered. You can kill him, but you cannot make him a hypocrite. Anam gave a good chance to you. I knew it when you were raising your hands – I knew how many hands were going to hug Anam. Don’t try to be so split. If you don’t want to raise your hands against him, don’t; raise them against me – but be true to yourself. If you are really in favor of Anam, then there is no need to be in favor of me. If you are in favor of Anam, then you should stand with him. That is the integrated person and his fragrance.\nRemember, whomsoever I love I am going to be hard with. I love you all – any day the hammer can fall on your heads. And I want others to remember to remind you, “Osho loved you so much; otherwise why should he bother about you? He loved you, that’s why he picked up a wrong attitude in you – to purify you, to make you more in tune with the commune, with the way of life that we are living here.” You will not start doing something that goes against me, my love.\nThe master is hardest on the best disciple – who cares about the third-rate? I am reminded of a beautiful true story. In India, just in this century, there was a world-famous painter, Nandalal Bose. He learned painting from his teacher who was world-famous. The teacher was none other than the father of Rabindranath Tagore, who won the Nobel prize for his poetry.\nOne day Nandalal painted a beautiful picture of Krishna playing on the flute. Whatever may be wrong in Krishna, one thing has to be appreciated – that he has chosen the flute as his symbol, rather than the cross. The flute reminds you of love, life, songs. The flute reminds you of the beauties and the wonders and the mysteries of life. It is a very life-oriented symbol. The cross is a death-oriented symbol.\nHence, around Krishna there is always dance; he is playing on the flute, and his female lovers are dancing around him. Many things are wrong in Krishna’s philosophy, but I cannot say that his celebration is wrong, that his dance is wrong, that his flute is not the right symbol.\nHave you ever hear of apostles dancing around Jesus, and Jesus playing the flute? That is inconceivable. His whole attitude is death-oriented. Just the other day I said to you that his own disciple – who was the most intelligent amongst all of his disciples, perhaps more intelligent than Jesus himself When he saw that Jesus was bent upon dying, Judas went ahead of him, just like a\nJew: “He is going to die, he cannot be prevented; crucifixion seems to be his goal – why not do some business in between?” For thirty silver pieces Judas sold Jesus to the enemies.\nIt is just Jewish – nothing was wrong with Judas. He was an intelligent man, he used the opportunity. In other circumstances, can you sell a dead human body for thirty silver pieces? And thirty silver pieces two thousand years ago was a great amount of money. Red Indians sold New York for exactly thirty silver pieces to the foreigners who had invaded it. It was a good price. But Judas loved Jesus. Don’t be surprised – he loved Jesus, he tried to prevent him, but when he saw the impossibility, just like a good Jew, he earned some money.\nBut when Jesus was crucified, Judas could not forgive himself. Then repentance overcame him and he started feeling guilty. And do you know, within twenty-four hours he committed suicide. Judas is condemned all over the world by the Christians. Nobody looks into that man’s suicide – why did he commit suicide? He loved Jesus so much, he wanted him to turn back, not to move towards Jerusalem where nothing but the cross was waiting for him.\nJesus did not listen to Judas, and Judas started feeling bad – he should have made more effort, he should have persuaded him. If it was needed, he should even have dragged him away from the cross. On the contrary, he simply proved a Jew, he made a business of it: he sold his own master. The guilt was so much that he committed suicide. The suicide was just to compensate for what he had done.\nNandalal Bose made a beautiful picture of Krishna playing on his flute, beautiful girls dancing around him. When he came to show it to his master – Rabindranath was present there – the master looked at the painting and said, “Nandalal, this kind of third-class painting is not expected from you.” He threw the painting out of the house, and said to Nandalal, “In Bengal, on the birthday ceremony of Krishna, thousands of people paint Krishna’s picture. They are sold very cheap.”\nIn Bengal there are many painters who paint only Krishna. They are called patias, because on a plate – patia and “plate” you can understand are the same – on a plate of wood, either they carve or they paint. But those patias, those painters, remain anonymous; nobody comes to know about them. They are not thought to be great painters. Just by the side of the road in Calcutta you can find them, selling pictures, paintings, carvings, for almost nothing. They are poor.\nThe master said to Nandalal, “Listen, your painting is not even equal to the paintings of the patias. Go to the patias and learn how to paint Krishna.” This was so hard. Nandalal touched the feet of the master and disappeared. For three years he was moving from one patia to another patia learning the art, how to paint.\nRabindranath could not tolerate this. He said to his father, “If you want to know the truth, the truth is that his painting is better than the paintings that you have made of Krishna. And your behavior is just insane!”\nThe master laughed, and he said, “Rabindranath, I have to be very hard on Nandalal. He is my best disciple, and he has much more capacity. Yes, I know you are right – his painting is far better than my own paintings, but he has yet much potential. If I had praised his painting, that potential would have remained just a potential. I want to bring him to his utmost flowering.” And there were tears in the eyes of the master; he said, “The job of a master is not easy, and it is not easy even to understand.”\nAfter three years Nandalal appeared with a new painting of Krishna. The master was thrilled. He said, “Now I can say to you, your first painting was also great, better than my paintings – but this is superb! Now nobody can transcend this painting. Now I am contented. You had potential, but a challenge had to be given to you.”\nMan’s potential blossoms only when there are challenges.\nI said a few things about Anam. I know he has great potential, and he is wasting his potential in stupid things. And you sympathized with him! Do you want him to remain the same as he is? It is not compassion that you gave him. You were not friends while you were hugging him, you were enemies. You should have told him, “You have behaved wrongly – this is not the way to communicate with a master. You are not making bridges with the master, you are making walls. We have great love for you, but no sympathy for your attitude.”\nAnd if he had heard, from thousands of sannyasins, the same thing – do you think something was not going to happen to him? I hit him hard, and you hugged him hard and destroyed my whole effort. Receiving your sympathy, he must have felt great, that everybody is favorable to him. You have supported his wrong attitude, not him. I was working on him, destroying his attitude; you did just the opposite.\nGrowth is not child’s play, it is a very conscious effort. And you all have to be supportive to the person’s innermost being, but never support any wrong attitude. Supporting the wrong attitude you are poisoning him, and enjoying your ego. It is a double-edged sword: you are killing him and you are killing yourself too.\nYou have to learn very clearly that if you support any wrong attitude, sympathize with it, that means you are also carrying something alike in you. Secondly, you are exploiting the man’s situation, and becoming holier-than-thou. Thirdly, you are pumping more air into the balloon of your ego. You are destroying both yourself and the other person.\nI am also very destructive, but my destruction is devoted to creation. I am going to destroy so many things in you that unless you are courageous enough, alert, aware of the fact that my destruction is of all that which is wrong in you I am doing exactly what a sculptor does.\nMichelangelo can perhaps be said to be one of the best sculptors of the whole history. He has made statues of Jesus so beautiful, so alive... even Jesus was not so alive nor so beautiful. The case is otherwise; there are ancient scriptures describing Jesus as an ugly man. Perhaps it may be an exaggeration by his enemies, but there must be some truth in it. At the best, he was just homely.\nBut Michelangelo has created such beautiful statues One of his statues of Jesus a few years ago\nwas destroyed by an atheist. It was in St. Peter’s Cathedral in the Vatican. Nobody had ever thought\nthat it had to be guarded! It was available for everybody to see. Just to be close to that statue was an experience – but one atheist destroyed it.\nHe was caught. Because he had destroyed one of the most beautiful things that man has created, he\nwas asked, “Why have you destroyed it?”\nHe said, “I am against God, I am against Jesus, I am against religion. That statue, although just a\npiece of marble, was creating in many people something which can only be called religiousness.”\nAnd do you know how Michelangelo found that piece of marble, that big rock? It was lying in front of a shop which had sold marble for years. Nobody had asked for it. Just to create a space in his shop, the shopkeeper moved the rock to the other side of the road, and it was lying there.\nOne day Michelangelo, passing along that road, saw the rock. He enquired of the shopkeeper, “To whom does it belong?”\nThe shopkeeper said, “Do you want it?” Michelangelo said, “Yes, absolutely.”\nHe said, “Take it – without any charge. I want to get rid of it.” And out of that ugly marble rock, which no artist had even looked at... and it was given to Michelangelo free, so some space would be created for other rocks. It was a big rock, and out of that rock Michelangelo created this statue, which was destroyed three or four years ago.\nWhen the statue was completed, he asked the shopkeeper to come and see. The shopkeeper could\nnot believe his eyes. He said, “You are a magician. What have you made out of that rock?”\nThe answer of Michelangelo is worth remembering. He said, “I have not created Jesus out of that rock. He was already there; I have only taken away unnecessary parts that were hiding him. Only the unnecessary has been removed, and the real which was lying within is now available to you. I have not created the rock, I have only destroyed those parts which were hindering the reality of the rock from your vision.”\nThat’s my work. You come to me just like a rock, with no face of your own, with no being of your own, with no centering, no grounding, no integrity, no individuality. I have to cut much; perhaps the major part that is hanging around you has to be cut.\nIt hurts, because you have been under the illusion that it is you. But when you come to see – if you go on hanging around me – one day, when all that is not part of you is eliminated and your reality is revealed to you and to others too, you will feel grateful. And then you will understand why I hit so hard.\nI am chiseling, hammering all that is ugly in you, all that has been given to you by your society, by your culture, by your civilization. I want to discover in you your original face.\nSo whenever I hammer on somebody, nobody is to show sympathy. Be a little more compassionate. Sympathy is a dirty word; be a little more compassionate. Help the man to understand that whatever I have said is creative, is to bring out his nature, his purity. And if you all go on making the man\naware, there is a possibility that he will start thinking, “If so many people are saying it, there must be something in it.”\nBut your sympathy destroyed... you washed out all that I had done. So when you see Anam again, take your sympathy back and tell him clearly, “That sympathy was bogus, unconscious, and what has been said is not against you” – what purpose have I to be against anybody? – “it was for your growth. We were wrong to sympathize with you. Our sympathy will strengthen your attitude, because you will think if so many people are with you, you must be right.” So change it. Make it clear to him, “We were wrong to sympathize, and you were wrong in your attitude.”\nI was working for years individually, but then I thought, how many people can I reach? – and I was continuously traveling up to 1970. So I could go on saying things, but it was not going to bring a transformation in people.\nI had to create a commune, where whatever I say is not just lost, but is echoed from everybody else too, from all sides and dimensions. And the person finds himself thinking, “So many people, friends, lovers, cannot be wrong.”\nYou have to help me in creating the New Man. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHATEVER THE QUESTION, YOUR ANSWER SEEMS TO BE THE SAME. HOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON BEFORE WE UNDERSTAND?\nAs long as you wish. As far as I am concerned, this very moment it can happen. It is not a question of time, it is a question of intense understanding.\nIt is true: whatever the question, my answer is the same, because there are not many questions, they are just phrased in different ways.\nBut the question also is one: you don’t know who you are. You are absolutely in darkness – unaware of your glory, your divinity, your beauty, your truth. All the questions differ only in phrasing. Naturally, I have to phrase my answers also according to your question.\nSomebody has counted through my books and found that I have answered ten thousand questions. My answer is one. I have not answered ten thousand questions, and I have not given you ten thousand answers. Your question is one, but you have asked it in ten thousand ways. My answer is one; just not to spoil the game I have answered you in ten thousand ways, hoping that perhaps, sometime, in a certain moment of silence, in a certain way, you may catch hold of the one answer.\nHow long you are going to miss, that depends on you. You have to receive it. I cannot give it to you, you have to take it.\nGurdjieff’s disciples were very puzzled about his statements. One of his statements which has been puzzling his disciples – there are still a few disciples of Gurdjieff in the world – was, “Unless you are capable of stealing the truth from the master, you will never get it.”\nThere is nothing puzzling about it. I am saying “You have to take it” just not to puzzle you. In fact, you have to steal it. It is just in front of you. The doors are open, nobody is guarding it, but you are keeping your eyes closed. It all depends on you. Open your eyes and see the light. Turn your back towards darkness, turn your face towards light. But you are standing just in the opposite way: facing a darkness that centuries have made denser and denser, darker and darker.\nIf you go on looking at this darkness of millions of years, you are bound to think you are blind. And what is the point of opening your eyes, even if you are not blind? It is better to keep your eyes closed and dream of some beautiful things. What is the point of looking into the abysmal darkness? – and that is what your Christianity is, your Hinduism is, your Mohammedanism is.\nAll the cultures and all the civilizations have been created to destroy the individual in you, and to create phony personality in you, and make you so much attached to the phony personality that you start thinking, “This is my individuality.”\nI have to hammer hard on your personality. It is going to hurt, but there is no other way. If you want not to be hammered, drop the personality yourself. Who is Anam? – just a personality. Who are you? – whatever people have said about you.\nWomen are known all over the world for continually looking in the mirror. The more idiotic of them carry a mirror in their bag too. What do they go on seeing in a mirror? The mirror cannot reflect your individuality – for that you need a master. The mirror can only reflect your personality; it cannot reflect your being, your center, but only your circumference.\nAnd women go on looking again and again. Once is enough – but how to be certain? Somewhere deep down you know perfectly well that that which is mirrored is not you, but you want to be convinced that it is you. And you go on decorating your personality – your hairdo, your lipstick. It is very strange.\nTo have red lips out of health is totally different to just painting them with lipstick. Who are you going to deceive? You cannot deceive even yourself. And this is not only true of children and young people; I see old women, who should have been in their graves by now, still painting their lips, putting on false eyelashes.\nYour personality is your creation. The society gives you all the incentives to create it, because phony people can be enslaved. Phony people can be Americans, Indians, Arabians, Chinese. Phony people will go to the church, to the mosque, to the synagogue.\nThe real individual finds his synagogue, his mosque, his temple, inside himself. He need not go anywhere. Whenever he wants to have a taste of that indefinable phenomenon, he just goes in. And just to be there is enough religion. More than that is not needed.\nThere is your silence, there is your peace. There is your blessing, there is your ecstasy.\nThere is your love – the whole treasure, the whole kingdom of God.\nHammering on your personality, I am trying to turn your attention from the personality towards the individuality. So please remember, whenever I hit somebody’s head, you are not to sympathize; you are not to put ointment on his head. And the person who gets the hit should feel grateful that he has been chosen, that he has been thought worthy, that he deserved a hit from the master. So whatever you have done with Anam, you have to undo. Anam has to be brought to his real, beautiful being.\nAnd I had to create a commune, because alone, how many people can I hit? And their skulls are so thick that small hits once in a while don’t matter. Here, you are thousands of sannyasins. Whatever I am doing, you all have to take part in it, you all have to help me.\nI would like you to be completely free from personality, because that means you are free from religion, you are free from culture, you are free from civilization, you are free from nationality, you are free from other kinds of ideologies. They are all part of your personality. Your individuality is just pure ecstasy.\nSo this should never happen again. And those who have hugged Anam should say to him, “Give it back – and we are sorry that we did something wrong to you. We love you, but we cannot love your stupidity, we cannot love your insanity.”\nThen only will the commune become a real organism, functioning in tune. Then only can there be a strange and new music, an unknown fragrance surrounding you and this holy land. This land is the same everywhere. It is the people who live on the land, who by their living meditatively, joyously, lovingly, consciously, not only transform themselves, they transform the whole atmosphere.\nJerusalem is not the holy land; perhaps once it was. Mecca and Medina are no longer holy lands; perhaps once they were. Bodh Gaya is no longer a holy land. It was once, but twenty-five centuries have passed since Buddha meditated, lived with his disciples in Bodh Gaya; it was a holy land.\nIf you remove the barrier of the personality, holiness suddenly explodes. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN MY HEART. IT POUNDS WHEN YOU ARE NEAR. IT IS HAPPENING TO MANY OF US. WHAT IS HAPPENING?\nThis is the happening for which I am here, you are here. It has no name. Call it just “happening.” It is\nimmensely beautiful. When your heart starts pounding, that means your heart is close to my heart.\nIt is a sign to you that the mind is left far behind, that you are no longer thinking but feeling, that you are no longer doing anything; it is happening. In the beginning you may get scared because it is so new. You may think something is going wrong – why is my heart pounding? – but only in the beginning. Just allow it, don’t try to stop it. Enjoy it, rejoice in it. This is communion, heart to heart.\nThere comes a moment when your heart pounds, beats in exactly the same rhythm, in the same frequency as my heart. Immediately there is a meeting. And that meeting brings transformation.\nThe master cannot do anything. He can only create certain devices in which the happening becomes possible. This commune is a device; otherwise there was no need for it. You were living somewhere, everybody was doing something. To take you out of your houses, your families, your cities – what is the purpose? The purpose is that if so many hearts start beating in the same rhythm and frequency, others whose hearts are not beating but whose heads are circling may catch the fire. It simply jumps like wildfire from one tree to another tree.\nI know a few people are in tune with me. That makes it easier for others to be tuned in with me. All these hearts together become a tremendous force. If five thousand people can be in one rhythm, in one frequency, they may create such great energy that it will start spreading around the world.\nThat’s why I have created communes in so many countries. I want all those communes to be exactly like this place, because I will not be there. The governments are making it impossible for me to go anywhere.\nIn India it was happening, just a very strange thing: in Poona the people were exploiting my sannyasins. For those seven years I was there, prices of everything had gone up ten times – only in Poona! A house that was available for twenty thousand dollars was not available even for one hundred thousand dollars. And seven thousand sannyasins were almost always there, and at moments there were ten thousand, fifteen thousand. All the hotels were full, overfull. People were renting houses, giving enormous amounts of money. They were becoming paying guests, giving enormous amounts of money.\nSo on the one hand the Hindu chauvinist mind was against me, because whatever I am doing goes absolutely against any kind of chauvinistic attitude – Hindu, Mohammedan or Christian – and on the other hand they were very happy that I was there. They were pressurizing the government of the state that I should not be given any land in the state; I should be living in Poona. Poona knew if I moved to some other place, all the beauty, the joy, the money – particularly the money – would disappear.\nThe Maharashtra government was preventing my moving from Poona. They found a way to prevent me. They would not say – politicians are cunning, they would not say, “You cannot go out of Poona”; that is against freedom. They continued to say, “You can find a place and you can go there,” but in that place they would create trouble so that people in that place would start being aggressive and protesting that I should not be allowed to be given any land close to them.\nThe Maharashtra government was enjoying, and greatly, because they have never seen so many tourists coming to Bombay airport. Now my secretary has just been there; you cannot find any tourists. And poor countries like India have much investment in tourism. So the Maharashtra government was forcing the central government, saying, “You should not give any place to Osho, because Maharashtra does not want to lose its tourism.”\nThe central government was being wishy-washy, always saying “We are giving you this land and that land.” It went on for seven years continually. They would not allow us to purchase more houses in Poona either, because they were afraid that if thousands of people who belong to me started living in Poona, they would take it over. And certainly, it would have happened.\nEven the Poona ashram was not in the name of the Foundation. We paid prices ten times more than anybody else, yet the government did not put those houses in our name. It was a very strange situation: we were paying the taxes, we were paying the electricity bills – and the houses were not in our name! We had given the money to the previous owners, but the houses remained in the name of those owners.\nThey were afraid that if a great commune happened, Poona’s whole character, its whole atmosphere, would change. And they were afraid of that. Poona is a very Hindu-minded city. It is a strange coincidence that the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi was from Poona, and the man who attempted to kill me was also from Poona. This is strange, because both these people belonged to the same political party. I have always been against Gandhism, but the political party that killed Gandhi... the same people tried to kill me. I am not a Gandhian, I am absolutely and totally against Gandhi and his ideology.\nBut the moment the knife was thrown at me, I could see the hesitancy in the minds of Poona people. On the one hand they wanted to exploit all these people; on the other hand they were afraid these people would destroy their so-called culture – which is already dead. There is nothing to destroy; the dead culture just has to be dragged to the crematorium.\nThe man who threw the knife must have been of the same dual mind. The whole of Poona was of the same dual mind: they could neither allow me to move out, nor could they allow me to grow vast. He threw the knife, and the knife fell nearabout twelve feet away from me. I was surprised! One can miss the target, but not by twelve feet.\nIt shows something in the psychology of the man. He represented the whole Poona-Hindu mind. He wanted to kill me, and yet he wanted me to remain there. So he did both things together: to satisfy himself and the Poona people he threw the knife, but it fell twelve feet away from me.\nI cannot go to another country, they have taken precautions. In Germany, they have put a lawsuit against me – I have never been in Germany! They have filed a case in the court to prevent my coming; if I go to Germany I will be arrested, and I will not be able to leave Germany till the litigation is over.\nIt is natural: the creation of a new milieu for growing individuals is bound to be opposed by everybody in the world. But there is nothing to be worried about. In fact, their opposition keeps us growing stronger and stronger. But they don’t know that. They are not intelligent enough to know either.\nPoliticians are always mediocre, because to be in politics you don’t need any qualifications except that you can be cunning, a hypocrite, expert in lying. And these things are not taught in any university, you don’t get any degrees in them. Politics is the only job where no qualification is needed. In fact, an intelligent person will not degrade himself by getting into politics. He can do far more and better things; why should he be sitting foolishly in a parliament, arguing about trivia?\nFor months, what do these people in the parliaments and the assemblies go on doing? It is just a kind of insane chattering club. About small things they go on arguing. The whole world is on fire, and they go on talking about land use laws. The attorney general of Oregon, the governor or Oregon, the “One Thousand Enemies of Oregon” – they are trying to prove that if Rajneeshpuram becomes a legal city it will go against land use laws. Can you think... are these people sane?\nThis land has not been used for many decades: no use is perfectly good use! We have made this land productive, and we are going to make it more and more productive; this is misuse, it is against land use laws. The Oregon Supreme Court has proved to be saner.\nAnybody can see a simple thing, that we have made a wasteland a beautiful oasis; they should be grateful to us. But the fear is that if this commune becomes a great power, it is going to create a wildfire all around. And they cannot ignore us. Nobody can ignore us.\nBut before they woke up to the fact, we had already made the commune, the city was incorporated. Now there is no way of going back. And my people are always going forward. We are going to make this place – for the first time – a real holy land.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nDO YOU MAKE DECISIONS? OR DO THINGS JUST HAPPEN AROUND YOU? CAN YOU GIVE SOME EXAMPLES?\nI have never done anything in my life. Even my shoes... Vivek puts them on my feet. You can’t conceive of a more lazy man than me. You must be thinking, why do I cross one leg over the other and never change it? It is sheer laziness, it is not some yoga posture. I don’t even put the watch on my wrist; that is Vivek’s job. She puts it on me, she chooses.\nI have never done anything in my life, but millions of things have gone on happening around me. I cannot take the credit for those happenings.\nExistence is not an act, a creation by a God; existence is an autonomous happening. Nobody is behind the curtain pulling the strings, sending messengers, holy books; there is nobody. Existence functions as an autonomous happening.\nThat day, thirty-two years ago, I became aware of the fact that even my birth was a happening. I have\nnot had anything to do with it. In fact, nobody had asked me, “Do you want to be born?”\nMy breathing goes on happening – it is wrong to say that I am breathing. You are not breathing; otherwise you would have been dead long ago, because what will you do in the night? When you are asleep, the breathing will stop; or sometimes even in the day you may forget, and you are finished.\nI trust in existence – I am part of it. And the moment I became aware that if stars go on moving without any mover behind them, if this whole vast existence is possible without any doer I am just a\nsmall, tiny part of this whole existence, why should I bother doing anything? Let things happen. And so much has happened that sometimes even I start wondering whether it has happened or somebody has done it.\nBut I have been continuously aware – aware that I am not going to do anything, because the ego is the doer. If you don’t do anything, the ego disappears; doing is nourishing the ego. Shifting from doing to happening, you have dissolved the ego. In doing you can fail, but in happening there is no\nway of failing. Whatsoever happens is right. So nobody can make me depressed, nobody can make me disappointed, because in the first place I am not trying to do something.\nDo you think that when I speak I move my hands? No, my gestures are just a happening, there is no doer behind them. My gestures are not the gestures of a Christian missionary.\nI used to go to visitIn Jabalpur there was Asia’s biggest training center for Christian missionaries,\nLeonard Theological College. Thousands of people were being trained how to become a missionary. I used to go – the principal was my friend, but that was just an excuse – I used to go there to see how stupid people can be.\nThe professors were teaching the students how to speak – when you have to speak slowly, when you have to shout loudly – and when you are speaking what gestures are suitable: when you have to raise your hand, when you have to hit the desk to make a point. I was simply amazed. These are actors, these are not missionaries; they are being trained.\nI don’t know how to speak; you cannot find a more amateur speaker in the world. I don’t know what I am going to say the next moment. My hands move on their own. In fact, the hands are extensions of your brain; your right hand is connected with your left brain, your left hand is connected with your right brain. They are in tune with my brain, so whatever gesture is there, it is not my doing. And the brain is a mechanism, it is not me.\nWhat I am going to say, I don’t know; I simply allow it to be said. That’s why it is so easy for me to go\non speaking for years – there is no problem. These are no prepared speeches.\nJust the other day Vivek was very amazed In the morning, after my bath and taking my breakfast,\nwhich is nothing much, just a glass of juice.… I am always in such a beautiful relaxed state that although I have slept the whole night – that was also beautiful – after my bath I can fall asleep again. I have to come here, so I have to leave at eight-fifteen. Vivek came and she saw me fast asleep. She woke me up, and she said, “It is now eight-twenty. Your secretary is waiting outside, and you are sleeping!” So just out of sleep I come here and start. But there is no doing in my life.\nYou all have come to me, I have not called you. Just think, your coming to me was a happening. Your being here with me is nothing like doing. Anybody who is here with effort is not going to remain here long. Only those who are here simply as a happening are going to be with me forever. And to me, each moment is an eternity unto itself.\nIf you are with me without any effort, without any doing on your part, you have fallen in tune with me, because I am just happening. If you are also in the mood of happening, suddenly there is no duality between me and you. Two happenings are not two; a thousand happenings are not a thousand. If all the sannyasins here are here without any effort and are just enjoying whatever is happening, then we are one soul.\nWhy does one have to make an effort? – because deep down one does not want to be here, that’s why one has to make an effort to be here. How long can you repress your going away, and why waste your time in repressing? If that is your destiny to go away, go away with joy, with all my blessings.\nIf it is a happening to you, then there is no question ever of saying, “Be here with all my blessings.” You will know it without my saying it. I will be overflowing in you, you will be reaching me. And this will be an absolutely invisible phenomenon.\nCHAPTER 14\nWe are here to be whole\n12 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF BEING A RAJNEESHEE AND LIVING IN A COMMUNE?\nIt is impossible. I am simply an individual who belongs to no religion, to no caste, to no cult, to no nation. And I cannot belong to anybody, for the simple reason that I am completely content with myself. The desire to belong arises because you feel empty. In a crowd of any kind – political, religious – you forget your emptiness; the crowd fills you.\nIt is impossible also because I am no longer seeking, searching for anything – existence has opened all its doors to me. I cannot even say that I belong to existence, because I am just part of it. If you are not part of it, then in some way you create a relationship, a belonging.\nWhen a flower blossoms, I blossom with it. When the sun rises, I rise with it.\nThe ego in me, which keeps people separate, is no longer there. I am dissolved – who can belong? I am not there. My body is part of nature, my being is part of the whole. I am not a separate entity.\nWhen you are a separate entity, there is fear. The universe is vast, the problems are immense. You would like a family to belong to, a community, a society, a culture, a religion. Alone you cannot\nface the vast emptiness surrounding you. Alone you are so small in comparison to the expanding universe – great fear arises.\nBut when you start belonging to a big crowd, the fear is diluted. So people belong to the family, they belong to a society, they belong to a culture, they belong to a church. And if even that is not fulfilling, then they create Rotary clubs, Lions clubs, the “One Thousand Enemies of Oregon.” The bigger the crowd, the bigger you start imagining yourself to be. If you are a Catholic, you know there are six hundred million Catholics – you become huge.\nI have no fear, because the one that could have fear has disappeared long ago. Even here, you are Rajneeshees, I am not. In fact, in my whole life I have never belonged to anything. I have been just a guest everywhere – even here I am simply a guest. Even my guesthouse is not within the boundaries of Rajneeshpuram.\nI am just an outsider, but to be an outsider and contented, fearless... because death cannot destroy me, there is nothing to be destroyed. My death has already happened thirty-two years ago; this is my posthumous existence. Any moment the body can fall apart, and I will be part of the whole. And remember, being part of the whole is not the same as being part of a machine, an organization. The words are the same, but in reality, to be part of the whole means to be the whole. There is no other way.\nTo be part of any kind of mechanism is not to be the whole mechanism. In your machines, cars, you can change a part because the part is really apart – you can take it out and put in another part. It was not the whole machine.\nBut to be part of the whole is totally different. You are irreplaceable. The stars are within you, just as you are within the universe. The universe is within you; there is no demarcation line.\nAnd this is my whole message to you:\nDissolve, be in a state of let-go.\nThen there is no death, then there is no fear. Then you are not alone, the whole universe is within you.\nAnybody who is awakened to the truth becomes an outsider to all kinds of collectivities. Gautam Buddha is not a Buddhist, Mahavira is not a Jaina, Jesus is not a Christian. There have been very few individuals in history who were part of the whole. Nothing less than that will do. Everything else is just a poor substitute.\nWhen I can have a friendship with the flowers and the trees and the birds and the stars, when I can love the smallest blade of grass and the biggest star – because they are mine and I am theirs – then what is the need to belong to a small, tiny group?\nI am making every effort so that you dissolve, so that you start melting into the whole, so that slowly, slowly you forget yourself and only remember the reality that surrounds you. Just as a dewdrop falls from the lotus leaf into the lake and becomes one with the lake, thirty-two years ago my dewdrop slipped from the lotus leaf into the lake of wholeness.\nI am no more. Whatever I say to you is the voice of the whole; hence, I am not worried about respectability or notoriousness. I am not worried about anything, because the worrier is not there. I am not even responsible. I have dropped myself into the whole; now the responsibility is of the whole. This is exactly the case with everyone, but you have to remember it. You have forgotten – you have been made to forget it.\nIn this commune slowly, slowly merge, melt, if the universe seems too vast and scares you. The purpose of the commune is to give you an opportunity that does not scare you. Melt! Don’t be a part of this commune, become the whole commune. Each individual in this commune is the whole commune.\nThis will give you a glimpse of dissolving, and if with such a small commune dissolving brings such great blessings, you will know the secret, from where it is coming. Then why remain stuck? You know the key – you can open the doors of the whole universe for yourself.\nA commune is only a small experiment, a kind of rehearsal where you can dissolve without any fear. Once you know how to dissolve, melt, you have known all; the same has to be done with the whole. And the paradoxical phenomenon is, when you dissolve in the whole, the whole dissolves in you. You don’t lose anything; you gain the whole universe! Perhaps you lose your chains, bondages, you lose your small, cozy, egoistic existence. But when you have the whole existence melting in you, who cares for small things?\nSo this is the only university. The other universities are teaching you to become strong egos. They are not universities, because the university should teach you to become one with the universe. That is the meaning of the word “university.” I don’t know what kind of idiots go on creating language. They create a university to strengthen your ego; they are against the universe.\nIn my way of seeing, they should call all the universities of the world – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, all the universities of the world – they should stop calling them universities; they are multiversities. There is nothing like unity with existence; they are making you more and more solid, crystallized, separate from everybody.\nThis university is exactly what the word means. We are not here to be part, we are here to be the whole. And when you can be the whole, it will be sheer stupidity to remain a part.\nI don’t belong to anything, because to belong means separation. I am in everything, and everything is in me.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY HAVEN’T PEOPLE FROM AFRICA COME TO YOU? MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME ARE WHITE-SKINNED. TO ME, WHAT YOU SAY IS FOR EVERYONE. ARE THE OTHERS AFRAID OF YOU?\nIt is true, what I say is for everyone. But everyone is not ready for it.\nWe have become accustomed to dividing the world into East and West. It has to be changed – we should start conceiving of the world as divided into North and South. East and West is not a true division, because the eastern people and the western people are all different shades of whiteness. They come from the same root, the same race – the Aryans. Their languages can prove it very easily.\nAll the languages of East and West are sister languages; their roots are derived from a single source, Sanskrit. The words may have taken different shapes, changes – a little bit here, a little bit there – but if you are careful you can figure out what has happened to each word.\nJust think of a few words of East and West, and you will see they are not separate people. You call man’s first beginning, Adam. Arabians call him Dum, Indians call him Admi. Do you see any difference?\nSometimes words take such a turn that suddenly you cannot see they are one. The first woman, you call Eve. In many languages she is called Eve. In Arabic she is called Hava. Now “Hava” and “Eve” seem to be two different words; they are not. “Eve” and “Hava” may seem very different, but if you go through all the intermediate steps: Eve, Eve, Hava – just one link, and you know this is the same language.\nThis is not true about South and North; their languages are not connected at all. They are totally different evolutions happening on the earth.\nGautam Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed, Moses, Jesus – they are all born in the northern regions. All the religions are born in the North; there is nothing comparable in the South. All the scientists are born in the North; there is nothing comparable in the South.\nThe South is living at least five thousand years behind. They are still living in the world of magic – science is very far away. Even your so-called religions have not evolved there. If in the South there are Christians it is because you have converted them, bribed them with education, food, better clothing, better possibilities to rise higher on the ladder of prestige, power, respectability.\nIn the South there are Mohammedans; they have also been converted – at the point of the sword. Mohammedanism in a way is very straight and direct. Why go in roundabout ways: teaching, feeding, giving clothes, education, sending people to learn in England, in France, in America – too long a route. They take a shortcut. They just put their sword on your neck, and they say, “Decide. You can live only as a Mohammedan, so choose between Mohammedanism and death.” It is not a question of choosing between two religions, it is a question of choosing between Mohammedanism and death. And naturally, one chooses Mohammedanism.\nYou are asking me why people from Africa are not coming to me. Now, what can I do? You should go to Africa and ask those people!\nBut I can see why they are not coming. There is a gap of five thousand years between you and them. I am saying, “between you and them” – the gap between me and them is immeasurable, you cannot calculate it. Even the northern white people find a great gap between me and them – what to say about the poor black people of southern Africa? They are still worshipping the magician, they\nstill believe in superstitions which were prevalent all over the world in the past. They are still groping in the dark.\nThe southern hemisphere needs to be transformed. But it is so difficult even to transform the northern people, who have been thinking for thousands of years, have created great philosophies, theologies, religions. You cannot name a single person from southern Africa who can be compared to Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. You cannot, because it has not happened. There has been no Kant, no Hegel, no Feuerbach. There has been no Martin Heidegger, Jaspers, Jean-Paul Sartre. And to understand me, you need this whole background.\nIt will look strange to you, that what I am criticizing continually and destroying continually is a basic need as a background to understand me.\nI cannot criticize Jesus to a southern African. What does it mean to him? Jesus has nothing to do with him. I cannot criticize Aristotle, he has never heard the name. So I can go on criticizing Aristotle, it is not going to make any dent; it is not his heritage. That’s why they are not coming.\nBut if you blossom, and your fragrance spreads, it will not be far in the future that even the Africans will be able to walk along with you. Right now, it is almost impossible. Your problems are different from their problems; your background is different from their background; otherwise, there is not much difference. As human beings there is no difference except the color.\nThe black people of South Africa are a little richer in color than the white people, because they have something more that you don’t have. They have a certain color pigment – not very valuable, maybe one-third of a dollar; that color pigment in their bodies is the only thing they have more than you. And it is an absolute necessity there – the sun is so burning hot that unless the body is black, it will not be able to survive.\nIn India, I know India is something in between: the skin is not as white as German nordics, but it\nis not as black as southern Africans, because India’s climate does not need that pigment which\nprevents sunrays from entering into the body.\nIndia was under British rule for two hundred years. For the people who had come from England, it was a suffering; India was too hot. Delhi is one of the hottest places in India, and that was the capital. So the British government made another capital in Simla, in the Himalayas; it was the summer capital. As the summer came, all the British people would move to Simla – the whole capital. They could not even survive in New Delhi. The moment India became independent, Simla was no longer a summer capital; the Indian skin can take the heat of Delhi.\nSo the only difference is of a little color pigment. Scientifically, I think it would be possible to inject you with the pigment and you would become black; or to find some way to take out the black pigment from the African, and he would be as white as you are – or even more, because he would be fresh. But then he could not survive in Africa, or he would have to make different arrangements to survive. Except for the color there is no difference, they are human beings just like you. But they have evolved in a different way from the North.\nThe North – particularly India – has created almost all the best religions. Compared to Jainism and Buddhism, Christianity and Mohammedanism look very childish. The reason was, India was\naffluent, rich; there was no poverty as it exists now. Twenty-five centuries ago India was known all over the world as a golden bird. It attracted all kinds of thieves to exploit that gold. Those who came – Moguls, Turks, Mongols, Hunas, Portuguese, French, English – they were all thieves in search of the riches that were available in India.\nIndia never attacked anybody – there was no reason. A rich man never goes to steal in a poor man’s hut, that is absolutely absurd. If the poor man goes to the rich man’s house to steal, it is absolutely logical. India never attacked any country; it was attacked by almost everybody. In twenty- five centuries they exploited everything India had. They were parasites; they have left India almost in a the situation of a skeleton. But in those good old days, India created the best philosophers.\nYes, even now, when the West is so rich, affluent, its philosophers cannot compare with the Indian philosophers of two, three thousand years ago – Nagarjuna, Shankara, Nimbark. Even today Sartre, Jaspers, Russell, have much to learn from these people. The country was so satisfied physically that it started groping for some spiritual nourishment.\nMohammed was a poor man, illiterate; so was Jesus a poor man, illiterate. Buddha was not a poor man and illiterate. He was a prince, the only son of his father; soon he was going to be crowned. He was educated in the best possible way, he was acquainted with all the wisdom available. His intelligence was sharpened in every possible way... because in India, philosophy has developed differently than it has developed in Europe.\nIt was developed not by writing philosophic treatises, it was developed by wandering philosophers arguing all over the country, debating, discussing, winning. And the rule of the game was that whoever wins in an argument becomes the master of the person who is defeated. And the defeated person – not in any sadness, but with great joy – surrenders to the master, because the question is not who is winning, the question is: What is true? And if this man has a better insight into truth, then there is no reason to be sad and sorrowful that you are defeated. You have found a better mind.\nIndian philosophers moving all over the country, arguing, sharpened the mind of the whole nation. They were not just sitting in their rooms and writing books, like Immanuel Kant or Wilhelm Hegel. That cannot give you that sharpness.\nI know it from my own experience. For thirty years I was traveling in India – arguing, fighting, challenging. I know that under that challenge, argument, your capacity, which ordinarily remains dormant, becomes active. Your intelligence, under the pressure of challenge, functions perfectly. It is a question of life and death.\nThe southern hemisphere is lagging behind – poor, uneducated. And the gap is big – five thousand\nyears at least. That’s why it is very difficult for them to commune with me.\nEven negroes in America who have been here for two hundred years, three hundred years They\ngo on writing questions to me, “You criticize Christianity, but you never talk about the religions of southern Africa.” There is no religion there – and I am not fighting magic, I am not a magician. Red Indians of America go on writing questions to me, “What about our religion?” You don’t have any. What you have is so primitive that I am not going to waste my time on it.\nIt is so difficult to convince the white races of the world. They are the most progressive, yet to convince them to drop all programs and conditionings is so difficult. And even if a man drops them, listens to my argument, understands the argument, that understanding mostly remains intellectual. And the question is: how am I going to reach your heart?\nThe Christian clergyman was from Sweden. He was under great pressure and trouble in Sweden because he was spreading my message there. He was giving my books to people he thought would understand. He created a great stir in Sweden – all the Christian churches condemned him and his congregation, saying that he was trying to destroy Christianity.\nHe continued to fight; in newspapers, on television, on radio, he was arguing. But coming here this year, he fell flat on the ground and forgot that he was giving my message to the Christians – because he had never heard me speak against Christianity. He was thinking that what I am saying I commented on Jesus and the Christians were surprised. I received so many letters from\nChristian clergymen around the world: “The way you have explained the words of Jesus, we had\nnever thought we never knew that Jesus was such a great philosopher, and that what he said has\nso many implications.”\nNow they all know: I was simply speaking for myself, my own ideas, using Jesus’ name – for a simple reason. I have done that with Hindus, with Mohammedans, with Christians – because from where else to get my congregation? So first I spoke on Jesus, choosing only those parts which I can support. Now I have my own people, and I don’t care a bit. Now I am going to tell you the whole truth!\nHearing the whole truth, that clergyman freaked out. I can understand his trouble. Now he will be torn apart in Sweden, because the Swedish orthodox Christians will be against him, and he cannot any longer go on propagating my word. And if he stops propagating my word, then the people who have come to him because of me will be against him. I have put him in a real fix. Now it is a question of either/or; he has to choose. That’s why he said, “You have given me moments of heaven and moments of hell.”\nFirst I give everybody moments of heaven. When I see that you are getting in tune with me, then I give you the moments of hell, because I have to destroy all the garbage that centuries have poured upon you. Unless you are completely free from all prejudices, you cannot open your heart to me. And I am not interested in your head; I am searching for your heart, because real religiousness is not a matter of the head.\nScience is a matter of the head, it has nothing to do with the heart. Religion is a matter absolutely concerned with your heart. Unless your heart starts beating with me, in tune, nothing is held back, you are totally and utterly harmonious with me only then can I bring you to the vision where this\nwhole universe is yours.\nThen you know there is no death, everything is eternal; nothing dies, things only change forms. Then you know the universe is not static; it is moving, alive, breathing. It is not standing still, it is progressing every moment.\nFirst, if you fall into a harmonious pace with me, then I am going to throw you into a bigger harmony,\nthe biggest, so that you can move with the stars, with the trees, with the rivers, with the oceans. Then only will you know what it is to be blessed.\nI feel sorry for southern Africa, but what can I do? They will not listen to me. Even you are hearing me and not listening to me. And I am a very pragmatic, existential man. I am not a Don Quixote. But if I can transform the vision of millions of white people, there is a possibility that those millions of people will create enough energy, enough power to transform even those who are so backward.\nI cannot go anywhere – no country will allow me in. Secondly, I cannot go anywhere because America will not allow me back in. They are holding my green card and hoping that somehow, someday I may go out of the country for some reason. Then they won’t allow me any entry again.\nBoys, forget all that. Green card or no green card, I am going to be here, because I know where I can have people who understand me. They will carry the fragrance.\nI have come to a new arrangement. I cannot go, but I have communes in Europe, in Japan, in Australia. I am starting a new program: we will be exchanging sannyasins for three months from one commune to another commune. Thirty sannyasins from Germany will be coming here; thirty sannyasins from here will be going to Germany. These thirty people going from here will take my fragrance there, and those thirty people living for three months here will catch fire!\nPoliticians think they are very intelligent – I can manage without going anywhere. From all over the world now, there will be exchange programs. Sannyasins who are now in tune with me will be going there. In fact, I am going there within those thirty sannyasins! And the thirty that will be coming here, I will enter in their hearts too. And this exchange program from commune to commune around the world will create, in fact, one single commune around the world.\nWe will be the first to dissolve the idea of boundaries. In Germany, or in Holland, or in England, or in Italy – anywhere – they will feel part of Rajneeshpuram, and they will not miss me at all. But about Africa, we will have to wait a little.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES? SOME OF GURDJIEFF’S DISCIPLES QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THINGS HE HAD SAID THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD AS LIES. HE REPLIED THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE THE TRUTH COULD BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IN TERMS OF A LIE. IS THAT THE TRUTH?\nAbsolutely true.\nWho can know it better than me?\nThere are problems in expressing truth. First, when you experience it, there is no word, there is no language. The mind is put aside. You experience it in such a profound silence that to give it in the form of words to others already makes it a lie. And a great master knows which lies can bring you nearer to him.\nYou cannot understand truth, that is certain, because truth is not something to be understood; it has to be experienced. The master’s work is not to make you understand what is true. His work is to create a situation in which you can see the truth.\nAnd if he speaks the truth right now, you will not be able to bear the shock of it. So he has to go very slowly. He will lie, because you can understand only lies. Unconscious people, blind people – they have lived on lies for centuries, they can understand a lie. But the master’s lie is a strategy.\nWhen I commented on Jesus before, in five volumes of books, I was lying. Jesus has not the meaning that I was putting into his words. But to bring Christians closer, that was the only way. I was speaking on Buddha, on Mahavira, on Krishna, because that was the only way.\nTruth cannot be said in the first place; and if you try, people will simply escape from you. You have to think about the people first, what is possible for them to absorb. And then slowly slowly they can absorb more and more. A time comes when you can start turning their vision towards the truth.\nIt is a great and arduous job to take away your diseases from you; you are clinging to them. I have to gain your confidence first. You are a Christian or a Hindu or a Jew, you are clinging hard to your religion – and I want you to drop it. The only possible way is to tell you that whatsoever you are carrying is not crap, it is Christianity, it is great! That helps you to come closer to me.\nThe moment I see you have come so close and so far, and the return is not possible, then I start hitting you. And then you will not feel hurt, you will rejoice that I have taken so much trouble in lying to you. That’s the way you catch men in your net. Once you are caught by me, once I see the certainty in your eyes that whatsoever happens you are going to be with me, when I have made absolutely certain that if you have to leave Jesus for me you will; that if it is a question of Krishna and me, and you have to choose, there is no uncertainty, you are going to choose me.…\nGurdjieff is right. He had a tremendously clear insight into the human mind. Perhaps in this century he was the most significant figure. And when he says, “The master has to use lies to bring you to the truth,” he is absolutely right, because that’s what I have been doing my whole life.\nIt is always a risky game. First talking to you about Jesus, his enlightenment – and he was not enlightened. First giving beautiful meanings to his words – which he was incapable of giving to those words. Once you become certain that I am in tune with Jesus, you have fallen in the trap.\nI don’t care about Jesus, Buddha or Mohammed. I care about you! And I will do everything that can make you alert, aware, conscious of the reality within you and without you.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE WORDS “NEGATIVE” AND “NEGATIVITY” ARE OFTEN USED IN THIS COMMUNE. WHAT DO THEY REALLY MEAN? THEY SEEM TO REFER TO ANY DOUBT OR QUESTION ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMUNE.\nNo, they don’t mean what you are thinking. They don’t mean that any questioning, any doubt, is negativity. I am teaching you doubting, questioning. How can my commune call you negative? Negative, negativity have a totally different meaning.\nThere are people who can only see the dark side; they are addicted to seeing the dark side. These addicted people are negative people. It is impossible for them to see the lighted side of anything.\nDoubt, question, but don’t become a negative being. A negative being cannot see anything right. A negative person cannot see anything beautiful; everything is dark, ugly, hopeless. A negative person is always in despair. Doubt is not despair, it is enquiry. Questioning is man’s birthright. Question as much as you can. Doubt, and don’t repress it, bring it forth.\nDoubt and questioning are positive qualities. You are saying, “I want to understand more clearly before I move, hence the question. The question is not against the commune, the question is for the commune, so that I can do better. If I go on keeping this doubt in me, I cannot commune with other people totally. Let me be freed from this doubt, this question.”\nWhy do I go on answering you? For what? Just so that your questions drop, they don’t become a barrier; your doubts drop, they don’t become a barrier, and you are light, you can fly... because doubts and enquiries repressed make you heavy. When all doubts are dispersed and all questions are answered, you start growing wings; you can fly, you are light.\nBut a negative person is a totally different phenomenon. He is determined to remain negative. He is determined to see only the black side. They say, “Every black cloud has a silver lining.” The negative person will say, “Every silver lining is surrounded by a black cloud.”\nI am reminded of a beautiful story. In a monastery, two monks were walking in the garden, and they both were in the same trouble. They were allowed to smoke outside the monastery, but they were not allowed to smoke inside the monastery. Most of the time they were inside the monastery, and they were chainsmokers; it was really a torture.\nThey enquired, “Why are we not allowed to smoke in the monastery?”\nAnd the answer came from the abbot, “The monastery is a place of prayer. You cannot be allowed\nanything that spoils the pure, divine atmosphere in the monastery. It is not a movie hall.”\nBut just this much was not going to help; they were addicted to their smoking. They said, “We should\ntry one time more – separately, not in the congregation.”\nThe next day one monk was sitting in the garden joyously smoking. The other monk came and was\nvery angry, he could not believe it. He said, “What are you doing? Have you asked the abbot?” He said, “Yes, and he allowed me.”\nThe other said, “This is simply injustice. I also asked him, and he said no!”\nThe man who was smoking smiled and he said, “I know why he said no to you and yes to me. I approached with positivity, you approached with negativity. Your negativity became a’no’ in the\nheart of the abbot. My positivity became a’yes’ in the heart of the same abbot. Please tell me what you asked, and things will be clear.”\nThe man who was angry said, “I asked, ‘Can I smoke while praying?’ And the abbot said, ’No!\nAbsolutely no.’”\nThe one who was smoking said, “I also asked him. I asked him, ‘Can I pray while I am smoking?’ And he said, ‘Yes! Absolutely yes!’”\nCHAPTER 15\nAll promise for tomorrow are lies\n13 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIT DISTURBS ME WHEN YOU DON’T SEEM TO BOTHER ABOUT FACTS.\nYou must be crazy! Why should it disturb you if it does not disturb me? It is true I have no respect for facts, for the simple reason that the fact is not the truth. The fact is our opinion about the truth. And what opinion can you have? – unconscious, blind, conditioned by centuries of rubbish. Why should I pay any respect to all this nonsense?\nSomething was a fact yesterday, today it is not. It was a fact for Jesus, Moses, Abraham, that the sun goes around the earth. It is no longer a fact, it is just the opposite: the earth goes around the sun. So why should you be disturbed? As man progresses and becomes more intelligent, has more scientific methods to probe into reality, facts go on changing every day.\nI have immense respect for truth, because truth is not man’s opinion. Truth is a revelation. You are\nnot, when the truth is there.\nYou cannot make an opinion about the truth. You can experience it, you can taste it, you can be it, but you cannot have an opinion about it, because the moment truth faces you, you are no more. The ego that used to make opinions simply disappears, just as when you bring light into a dark room the darkness disappears. In fact it was never there it was only the absence of light. The moment the light is present, how can the light and the darkness exist together?\nAnd your opinion is simply a barrier in finding the truth. You somehow have got the idea that fact and truth are synonymous; they are not. Sometimes the fiction is more true than the fact. Just look at the three hundred years’ growth of science. Everything has changed. Aristotle’s logic was a great discovery, accepted by all for almost thousand years. Now it is just garbage. Non-Aristotelian logic has taken its place; someday it will also be in the garbage.\nMan’s truth – what he calls fact – has no validity. It is the blind man’s idea of light. Why should I have any respect for it? And the most amazing part is: why are you disturbed? The psychology of it is very clear. When I don’t pay any respect to the so-called facts, your knowledgeable mind gets disturbed. You want me to be infallible, you want me to be the greatest master in the world. Not that you are interested in me, your interest is in being the disciple of the greatest master in the world. Your desire is to belong to a master who is always respectful of facts.\nRemember, in many different contexts this will happen to you. I have said again and again, I am a fallible, ordinary man. And to be a disciple of a fallible, ordinary man is disturbing. But that simply shows your ego and its longing. You would like to make me a God, because then you become also God’s disciple. Then there is a direct communication line between God and you.\nForgive me, I am not God, and there is no one who is, no one who has ever been. It is your psychology that has created the prophets, the messiahs, the avataras. They fulfilled your desire. And naturally, it was good business: they became messiahs, and you became the special apostles of the messiah. Unless man drops this stupid psychology, it is very difficult to get rid of messiahs, prophets, great masters, because you are so insistent on being a great disciple. How can you be a great disciple if the master is fallible?\nI am trying in every way to destroy your psychology, which has dominated humanity for centuries. It has made you almost unintelligent, but the balloon of your ego goes on becoming bigger and bigger. You, your individuality, your consciousness, go on diminishing in the same proportion.\nWhat do you want? Should I say things which satisfy you? Or should I say things as they are, whether they satisfy you or hurt you? It is your responsibility, it is not my concern. Listening to your question, I said, “Aha! Back to zero again!” Are you ever going to grow or not?\nThe geometric philosophy of Euclid dominated for centuries; no one ever objected. Just within a hundred years the whole Euclidean geometry has become a fiction; a non-Euclidean geometry has taken its place. I say to you, the non-Euclidean geometry is also a fiction. It is not going to remain there forever as a fact. Nothing that man creates out of his sleep can become the eternal truth. To know the eternal truth, man has to disappear completely. He is the hindrance.\nI am going to continue hammering your psychological slavery. I am not concerned about facts, I am concerned with your freedom. You have to be freed from all that is not your experience. And remember, your experience is not yours, it is only experiencing. I have immense respect for experiencing. The facts, at the most, may be useful in the ordinary world of objects, but they have no basis in reality.\nExperiencing may not be of any use in the outside world – perhaps it may create trouble for you, but flowers will start showering on you, your being will be contented. You will feel an absolute certainty that you have come home.\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nLATELY I HAVE NOT FELT BLISSFUL, BUT HAVE BEEN HAVING MANY DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS. AM I MISSING THE POINT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?\nYes, you were missing the point when you were feeling blissful. Now you are getting it! All that blissfulness was just bullshit; you projected it. Now you are disturbed: that blissfulness has disappeared and doubts, enquiries, questions are arising. And I say, this is what should happen to everybody.\nIf your blissfulness was existential, true, then there would have been no way for doubts to arise. It was a hallucination. You were on a honeymoon trip, and now the honeymoon is finished. You are back home unpacking the same suitcases which just seven days before you were packing with such great joy. And now, look in the mirror and see your face again. What happened to that bliss? What happened to that expectation? What happened to your sweet dreams?\nA dream is a dream, whether it is sweet or bitter, and sooner or later you have to drop it; you cannot carry it forever. Only truth can remain with you forever. That’s why I say feel blessed, not blissful, that for the first time your intelligence has started functioning, that some kind of awakening is happening, that the morning is very close by. Those questions, enquiries, doubts, are of immense value; your blissfulness was not worth a penny. I say so because these doubts, these enquiries, these questions, are the beginning of the pilgrimage to truth.\nI am against drugs for this reason – because the drugs can give you a false blissfulness, and can stop you questioning, enquiring, doubting. Even a man like Aldous Huxley fell into the same ditch. When he took LSD he thought, “This is what Buddha was experiencing, Kabir was experiencing, and all the great masters of the world were experiencing.” He thought, “We have found, for the first time, the shortcut to paradise.” But within hours the effect of the LSD disappears, and you are back again, the same man, the same miserable creature. LSD has not transformed you.\nAny hallucination – either created by drugs, or created by programming your mind, or created by your hidden desires of being great – is a hindrance to realizing the truth.\nLet me repeat: now you are in the right state of mind. It is painful, bitter, but this is the nature of existence. Truth in the beginning is bitter, in the end, tremendously sweet – and sweet forever. The untruth is very sweet in the beginning, but ultimately leads you into hellfire. And then it is too late to come back to your original state and start again. Very few people have that courage.\nFrederick Nietzsche, although a madman, had many beautiful flashes of light, love, truth. He says man passes through three stages of consciousness. The first stage he calls the camel, the second stage the lion, and the third stage – the ultimate – the child. He has chosen strange names for these stages.\nYou are all camels, the ugliest animal on the earth! – nothing is straight. Have you ever ridden on a camel? Then you will know. I have suffered much, because in India in the desert of Rajasthan, the\ncamel is the only way to go from one place to another. Sitting on a camel for a few hours, one starts believing that hell is real.\nThe second stage Nietzsche calls the lion... a strange coincidence, because Buddha used to call his words “the lion’s roar.” The lion is one of the most beautiful animals on the earth; strong, and capable of being alone. The lion doesn’t live like a sheep, in crowds. He lives alone, without fear. He is ready to take any risk.\nYou have to become a lion to be alone. That does not mean that you have to leave your family, your friends, your society, your commune – no. You can be alone in the crowd, there is no problem. In fact, you are alone. The crowd may be big – you can forget your aloneness in the crowd, but forgetting makes no difference. Here, you are thousands of sannyasins Just become a little alert,\nand you will find you are alone. I am talking to each of you separately. Nobody can talk to a crowd.\nAnd the third stage Nietzsche calls the child. He has chosen a beautiful name for the third stage – the newborn baby, fresh, no ego, no desire to be somebody special in the world, no programmed mind, no conditioning. He is neither Christian nor American, neither Hindu nor Indian; he is simply himself. And there is utter silence in his being. He has not yet read all kinds of things – which are useless, but they clutter your mind; a moment comes when you are just a junkyard. The child’s consciousness is just a mirror. It reflects whatsoever comes in front of it.\nThe child does not know names. Do you think if you bring a red roseflower before the child he will be thinking in his mind, “This is a red rose, a very beautiful flower”? No, he will be seeing the flower, as you never have. The fragrance will be reaching him as it cannot reach you because there are so many barriers. He does not know the name of the color, of the flower. He does not know that it is beautiful. As far as his mind is concerned, it is silent, but he experiences the flower in its totality. Words are not needed.\nA rose is a rose is a rose.\nNames and labels are not needed. What is needed is clarity, innocence.\nThe third stage, the ultimate stage , Nietzsche calls the child. And that’s what I am trying to do: to make you a child again – fresh, uncluttered, with no ideology, so that you can encounter existence directly. But if you want to experience it directly, you will have to cut out all that prevents you from experiencing directly. Doubt is a great instrument, questioning is of tremendous help, because without them there is no enquiry.\nRemember that doubt, enquiry, questions, are not negative. They are a search for the positive. They become negative only when you get stuck with them, when you make your doubt your belief – then they are negative. When your enquiry becomes an addiction, and you forget completely what you are enquiring for, then you are in bad shape. Otherwise, it is a blessing that your hallucinations are over.\nWhat has actually been happening with my people in these thirty years? I have been in contact with thousands. I was speaking on Mahavira – only the followers of Mahavira felt blissful. I was\nspeaking on Jesus – Christians felt blissful, because they thought I was supporting their ego, their programmed mind, their Christianity, their Jesus. So this has been happening again and again. First, to gain your confidence, I say beautiful things about Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha. The moment I see that now it is time – you cannot go back, you have come too close to me – then I start speaking the truth.\nIt hurts, but this hurting is healthy. It hurts because it uncovers your wound. A covered wound you may forget, but it is there and growing, and may become a cancer. Open it to the air, to the sun, to the moon, to existence. The whole existence is a healing force. If it can give you life, can’t it heal small wounds created by your parents, your teachers, your politicians? It is a very small job for existence. You just have to open your wounds. And in the beginning it will hurt.\nYou are asking me, “Am I missing the point?” No, sir! This is the point, you are getting it. Now it is up to you: you can escape and hide again in your illusory blissfulness, or you can give a lion’s roar and take the quantum leap into reality, knowing perfectly well it is going to hurt.\nBut that is not the end. It hurts only because of your clinging to your past blissfulness. Once your past blissfulness is dropped, understood as a dream, the hurting disappears, the despair disappears. On the contrary, for the first time you have risen as a man; you are no longer an animal. For the first time the night is over and the sun has risen. And you have learned a great secret.\nGo on using that secret, and the third state of consciousness is not far away. It is within your reach.\nThe lion’s roar breaks you away from your past, and joins you with your future.\nTo become a child again is the greatest joy, and the greatest achievement, because it gives you innocence, freedom, clarity to see things as they are.\nI am reminded of a story I have loved always. A great king conquered almost all the known world of his time, and then there was frustration – what to do next? He had everything, and he was stuck. The old habit, the old greed of gaining more and more, – and now he found suddenly that now there was no more. His whole life’s training was for more and more and more, and now he had everything, there was nothing more.\nHe was very sad. His wives, his advisors, all tried to cheer him up, but he said, “It is futile. Unless I have something more to conquer, what is the point of living any longer?”\nThen a very cunning priest – in fact, I should not say both the words together, because the priest means the cunning – appeared in the court. And he said, “Don’t be worried, I have heard about your anguish – there is still much more. For example,” he said, “I can bring you divine clothes from God, which have never come to the earth. You will be the first man, and perhaps the last to have them.”\nThere was silence, there was doubt. But the king said, “What can he do?” He asked, “What is going to\nbe the cost?”\nThe priest said, “Then forget all about it. One who asks the cost is not worthy of receiving them. They\nare priceless. But just to satisfy your enquiry I will say that a few billion dollars will be needed.”\nThe king said, “There is one condition. You will remain in one of my palaces, guarded inside, and do whatsoever ritual, prayer you want to do. And the moment you bring the clothes here, the money will be delivered.”\nThe man said, “There is no problem; as far as I am concerned it is perfectly good. But I will have to deliver the money when I get those clothes from God – and I am a poor priest, you have to give me money now. And I will remain in your palace. Keep all the doors closed, keep the palace fully surrounded by your military, so that you can feel comfortable. And the moment I bring the clothes, I will knock on the door; then the guards have to take me to the place where you live.”\nAfter three days he knocked on the door. Nobody believed it, everybody was thinking that he seemed to be either very cunning or just insane. Who has ever heard of the clothes of God coming to the earth? But they all waited. The king could not even sleep, he was so thrilled. He was again blissful: a new horizon to be achieved, a new dimension opening – and for the first time! These moments were historic.\nAfter three days the man came with a beautiful box to the court of the king. He put the box down and said to the king, “God was very pleased, because you are the bravest man ever. He has sent the divine clothes. Just two things have to be remembered. One, the clothes are invisible, just like God. Secondly, you have to take your clothes off. Give me your cap and I will give you the divine cap; put it on your head.\n“Just as I was coming I said to God, ‘This is a little hard, that the clothes will be invisible.’ God said, ‘I will make one exception: the man who is truly born out of his own father – one who is not a bastard – will be able to see them.’ This is a special concession.”\nThe box was opened. The king looked into it: it was empty – of course, the clothes were invisible. His intimates in the court looked into the box, and they all started cheering and clapping, and they said, “What beauty!”\nThe king thought, “Strange! Now if I say that the box is empty I will be condemned by my own people. They will say that I am not the son of my father, that my mother was flirting with somebody else. It is better to keep quiet and save my prestige.” He also said, “Great! You have done something impossible.”\nAll the people in the court saw that the box was empty, but the same question was in their minds: “All the others are seeing them, only I am not; something is wrong with me. It is better to keep silent – not only silent, but to praise the clothes more than the others, to prove that I am the son of my own father.”\nIf things had stopped there, the king would have been happy. But the man was really a priest. He took the clothes out one by one and gave those invisible clothes to the king to wear, and he acted as if he was putting a new robe on him. At the end it became difficult, because he asked about the underwear.\nThe king hesitated. He knew that there was nothing, that he was standing almost naked, only the\nunderwear was left. But now it was too late. If he said, “You cheat! You have taken so much money,”\nthat wouldn’t be right because the whole court was dancing with joy: “You look so beautiful, just like God!”\nThe poor king had to part with his underwear too. Now he was standing completely naked. And the priest said, “Because the clothes from paradise have come for the first time on the earth, the whole capital is standing outside the palace; they want to see their king in divine clothes.”\nAgain the king thought, “What to do? If I say no, it is too late.” He had to say yes. On a beautiful chariot the naked king was standing, and the crowd lined the road on both sides – millions of people shouting, dancing, clapping, saying to each other, “This is the greatest moment in our lives! We have not seen God, but we have seen his clothes. This is not a small thing.” And they were all seeing that the king was standing naked, but they had heard the condition – that only those who are born out of their own fathers will be able to see the clothes.\nSo everybody was seeing them, except a little child who had come with his father. Sitting on his\nfather’s shoulder, he said, “Daddy, the king is naked!”\nThe father simply said, “Shut up, you idiot! When you become my age you will not see the king naked. You don’t understand anything. And if you say it again, I will beat you! Keep your mouth closed.”\nBut the child said, “It is strange! Everybody is seeing the clothes except me.” Only the child was seeing the truth, and the crowd was pretending to see. And if you pretend anything long enough, it starts becoming a fact to you, you start believing in it. But it is poisoning your whole potentiality.\nForget all those blissful moments that you had felt before here. Now I am in a hurry, and I am going to open all your wounds. So only those who have the courage of a lion will remain my sannyasins. The camels have already left for Santa Fe!\nAnd if you are courageous enough, like a lion, your beautiful childhood innocence is not far away. It is yours just to take. Be thankful to your doubts, your enquiries, your questions. They will lead you to the truth.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR MEN AND WOMEN TO BE FRIENDS? IT SEEMS SO ORDINARY, AND TURNS OUT TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. EITHER THERE IS AN UGLY COMPROMISE – LIKE MAN AND WIFE – OR ELSE PASSION THAT EVENTUALLY TURNS INTO HATE. WHY IS THERE ALWAYS UGLINESS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN?\nIt is very simple to understand. Marriage is the ugliest institution invented by man. It is not natural; it has been invented so that you can monopolize a woman. You have been treating women as if they were a piece of land, or some currency notes. You have reduced the woman to a thing.\nRemember that if you reduce any human being to a thing – unaware, unconscious – you are also being reduced to the same status; otherwise, you will not be able to communicate. If you can talk with a chair, you must be a chair.\nMarriage is against nature.\nYou can be certain only of this moment that is in your hands. All promises for tomorrow are lies – and marriage is a promise for your whole life, that you will remain together, that you will love each other, that you will respect each other till your last breath.\nAnd these priests, who are the inventors of many ugly things, say to you that marriages are made in heaven. Nothing is made in heaven; there is no heaven.\nIf you listen to nature, your problems, your questions will simply evaporate. The problem is: biologically man is attracted to woman, women are attracted to men, but that attraction cannot remain the same forever. You are attracted to something which is a challenge to get. You see a beautiful man, a beautiful woman; you are attracted. Nothing is wrong in it. You feel your heart beating faster. You would like to be with this woman or man, and the attraction is so tremendous that in that moment you think you would like to live with this woman forever.\nLovers don’t deceive each other, they are saying the truth – but that truth belongs to the moment. When lovers say to each other, “I cannot live without you,” it is not that he is deceiving or she is deceiving, they mean it. But they don’t know the nature of life. Tomorrow this same woman will not look so beautiful. As days pass, the man and the woman both will feel that they are imprisoned.\nThey have know each other’s geography\ncompletely. First it was an unknown territory to be discovered, now there is nothing to be discovered. And to go on repeating the same words and the same acts looks mechanical, ugly. That’s why passion turns into hate. The woman hates you, because you are going to do the same thing again. To prevent you, the moment the husband enters the house she goes to bed, she has a headache. She wants somehow not to get into the same rut. And the man is flirting with his secretary in the office; now she is an unknown territory.\nTo me, it is all nature. What is unnatural is binding people in the name of religion, in the name of God, for their whole life.\nIn a better, more intelligent world, people will love, but will not make any contracts. It is not a business! They will understand each other, and they will understand the changing flux of life. They will be true to each other. The moment the man feels that now his beloved holds no joy for him, he will say that the time has come to part. There is no need for marriage, there is no need for divorce. Then friendship will be possible.\nYou ask me why friendship is not possible between men and women.… Friendship is not possible between the jailer and the imprisoned. Friendship is possible between equal human beings, totally free from all bondage of society, culture, civilization, only living true to their authentic nature.\nIt is not an insult to the woman to say, “Honey, the honeymoon is over.” It is not an insult to the man if the woman says, “Now things cannot be beautiful. The wind that has blown is no longer there. The season has changed, it is no longer spring between us; no flowers blossom, no fragrance arises. It is time to part.” And because there is no legal bondage of marriage, there is no question of any divorce.\nIt is ugly that the court and the law and the state interfere in your private life – you have to ask their permission. Who are they? It is a question between two individuals, their private affair.\nThere will be only friends – no husbands, no wives. Of course, if there is only friendship, passion will never turn into hate. The moment you feel passion disappearing, you will say good-bye, and it will be understood. Even if it hurts, nothing can be done about it – it is the way of life.\nBut man has created societies, cultures, civilizations, rules, regulations, and made the whole humanity unnatural. That’s why men and women cannot be friends. And men and women either become husbands and wives – which is something absolutely ugly; they start owning each other.…\nPeople are not things, you cannot have ownership. If I feel your wife is beautiful, and approach her, you are angry, you are ready to fight because I am approaching your property. No wife is anybody’s property, no husband is anybody’s property. What kind of world have you created? People are reduced to properties; then there is jealousy, hatred.\nYou yourself know that you are attracted to the neighbor’s wife; naturally, you can guess about your wife too. Your wife knows perfectly well she is attracted to somebody else, but she cannot approach that person because of the husband: he is standing there with a gun! Love is bound to turn into hate, and for the whole life the hate goes on accumulating. And out of this hatred do you think beautiful children are going to be born? They are not born out of love, but out of duty. It is the wife’s duty to allow you to use her.\nTo tell the truth, there is no difference between wives and prostitutes. The difference is just like the difference between having your own car or going in a taxi.\nYou go to a prostitute – it is for a few hours, it is beautiful. After a few hours it is finished; you have paid the woman. And now there are male prostitutes also, particularly in California; California seems to be not part of this world. A few hours of relationship is purchased, and when you pay the woman or the man, everything is goody-goody. You will not recognize each other the next day when you meet on the street; there is no need, there has been no contract. You will not even say hello, not even “Hi.” There is no need.\nA prostitute is purchased only for a few hours; wives are a long-term affair, it is economical. Royal families are not allowed to marry outside royal blood: status, money, power.… Nobody can love anybody in such circumstances, where the relationship is financial.\nThe woman is dependent on you because you earn. And for centuries men have not allowed women to be educated, to be in business, to have jobs, for the simple reason that if the woman has her own financial status, her own bank account, you cannot reduce her to a thing. She has to be dependent on you. And do you think anybody who has to be dependent on you will love you?\nEvery woman wants to kill the husband. It is another matter that she does not kill him – because if she kills him, what will she do? She is not educated, she has no experience of the society, she has no way of earning. The husband – every husband, I don’t make any exceptions – wants to get rid of the woman. But he cannot get rid of her. There are children, and he himself has promised the woman thousands of times that he loves her. When he goes to his job he kisses the woman; there is no love in it, just skeletons touching each other. Nobody is present.\nMan has created a society in which friendship between man and woman is impossible.\nI would like my people to remember – even though you have to follow the laws of the society; otherwise they will imprison you and punish you and kill you... but remember, friendship is so valuable that whatsoever the consequence, remain friends even with your wife, even with your husband, and allow absolute and total freedom to each other.\nI don’t see any problem. If I love a woman, and one day she says that she has fallen in love with somebody else and feels very happy, I will be happy. I love her, and I would like her to be happy – where is the problem? I will help her in every way so that she can be more happy. If she can be more happy with somebody else, what hurts me?\nIt is your ego that hurts: she has found somebody else who is better than you. It is not a question of better, it may be just your chauffeur – it is just a question of a little change. And if you give full freedom to each other, perhaps you can remain together for your whole life, or for the whole eternity, because there is no need to get rid of each other.\nMarriage creates the need to get rid of each other, because it means freedom is taken away – and freedom is the highest value in human life. Make all the couples free, and you will be surprised, this very world becomes paradise.\nThere are other problems. You have children – what to do with children? My answer is that children should not belong to their parents, they should belong to the commune. Then there is no problem. The parents can meet the children, they can invite the children, they can be friends with their children; and yet the children are not dependent on them, they belong to the commune. And it will destroy many psychological problems.\nIf a boy knows only his mother, the mother’s personality becomes an imprint on him. Now, his whole life he will be trying to find a woman who is like his mother – and he will never find such a woman. A girl will never find another man who is exactly a copy of her father. Then you cannot be satisfied with any woman, any man.\nBut if the children belong to the commune, they will come in contact with so many uncles and so many aunts – they will not carry a single picture in their minds. They will have a vague idea of womanhood or manhood, and to that idea, many people of the commune will have contributed; it will be multidimensional. There is a possibility of finding somebody, because you only have a vague idea. You can find somebody, and that person will make your vague idea solid, a reality. Right now you have a solid idea within you, and you meet a vague person. Sooner or later there is disappointment.\nAnd children belonging to the commune will learn much, will be more friendly, will be more available to all kinds of influences. They will be richer. A child being brought up by a couple is very poor. He does not know that there are millions of people with different minds, different kinds of beauty. If a child moves in the commune, naturally he will be far richer. And he will have known so much before he decides to be with someone that there is a possibility of a long friendship.\nWhat happens now? You see a girl on the beach and you fall in love. You know nothing about the girl, you know only her make-up. Tomorrow morning when you get up and the make-up is gone, you\nwill say, “My God! What have I done? This is not the woman I married, this is someone else!” But you cannot go against your word either. And if you do, then the government is there, the courts are there to put you back into your right place. This is a very ugly situation, sick.\nPeople should be given freedom to know each other, to know as many people as possible, because each person is so unique, there is no question of comparison. Let the child drink from many sources, and he will have some insight into who is going to be the right person to live with.\nNobody will fall in love; everybody will decide consciously that “This is the one.” He has known so many people, he understands that this is the one who has those characteristics, those qualities that he has loved. And then too it is only going to be a friendship. There is no fear; if tomorrow things change there is no harm.\nThe society should not live in a routine way, in a fixed way – static, dormant – it should be a moving flux. One woman can give you a certain kind of joy, another woman can give you another kind of joy. A third woman will be a surprise. So why remain poor”? – just because Jesus has said, “Blessed are the poor”?\nBe richer in every dimension, and keep yourself open and available. And whoever you are with, let the other person understand clearly that “It is freedom between us, not a marriage license. Out of freedom we meet, with no promises for the future – because who knows the future?”\nWhen I was a student in the university in my final master’s course, one girl was very much interested in me. She was a beautiful girl, but my interest was not in women at that time. I was crazy in search of God!\nAfter the examinations, when she was leaving the university She had waited – I knew it – she had\nwaited and waited for me to approach her. That is the usual way, that the man approaches the woman; it is graceful for the woman not to approach the man. Strange idea... I don’t understand. Whoever approaches, it is graceful. If fact, whoever initiates is courageous.\nWhen we were leaving the university she said, “Now there is no chance.” She took me aside and said, “For two years continuously I have been waiting. Can’t we be together for our whole lives? I love you.”\nI said, “If you love me, then please leave me alone. I also love you, that’s why I am leaving you alone – because I know what has been happening in the name of love. People are becoming imprisoned, chained; they lose all their joy, life becomes a drag. So this is my parting advice to you,” I said, “Never try to cling to a person for your whole life.”\nIf two persons are willingly together today, it is more than enough. If tomorrow again they feel like\nbeing together, good. If they don’t, it is their personal affair; nobody has to interfere.\nUp to now, the problem of the children has always been raised. My answer is that children should belong to the commune. They can go to their parents, whether their parents are together or separate. And they should learn from their parents that love is no slavery, it is freedom. And they should move in the commune, tasting, enjoying different qualities of different people.\nSo by the time they decide, their decision will be not just a foolish type of “falling in love”; it will be a very considered, contemplated, meditated phenomenon. There is a possibility they may remain together for their whole lives. In fact, if there is freedom, there is more possibility; more people will remain together.\nIf marriage disappears, divorce disappears automatically. This is a by-product of marriage. Nobody takes note of the simple fact: why for centuries have there been prostitutes? Who created them? Who is responsible for these poor women? It is the institution of marriage.\nYou are bored with your wife; just for a change you go to a woman who is not going to be a bondage – because one is enough, two will be too much. It is just a temporary, few hours’ meeting. You can keep yourself lovely for a few hours, loving for a few hours. She can keep herself lovely and loving for a few hours. And moreover, she has been paid for it.\nAround the world millions of women are reduced to selling their bodies. Who has done it? Your political leaders, your religious leaders. I consider these people criminals. And not ordinary criminals, because for centuries the whole humanity has been suffering because of these few idiots.\nBut you have to start with yourself, there is no other way. If you love somebody, then freedom should be the connecting link between you. And if you see your woman tomorrow hugging somebody else, there is no need to be jealous. She is being enriched, she is tasting a little newness – just the way you go sometimes to a Chinese restaurant! It is good. You will come back to your own food, but the Chinese restaurant has helped you; you may relish your own food more.\nBut after a few days, again – that’s how the mind is – you are moving towards an Italian restaurant... spaghetti. I cannot even tolerate somebody eating spaghetti in front of me! But that is my problem\nLife is so simple and so beautiful, just one thing is missing: freedom. If your wife is being with some other people, soon she will come back to you enriched, with new insight. And she will find something in you she had never found before. And meanwhile, you need not just sit down in your chair and beat your head. You also gain experience, so that by the time your woman is back you are also new. You have also been to the Chinese restaurant.\nLife should be a joy, a rejoicing. And then only can there be friendship between men and women; otherwise, they are going to remain intimate enemies.\nCHAPTER 1 6\nYou have to grow inwards, that is your earth\n14 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE GROWTH MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CALLED THE “NEW NARCISSISM” BY MANY, DUE TO ITS EMPHASIS ON ASSERTIVENESS AND VALUING ONE’S OWN PERSONAL EGO. HOW DOES YOUR WAY DIFFER?\nThere is no way. It is impossible to have a way, because you are already there. You have never left home. This whole search for the way is driving you crazy; you cannot find it because you are already there. Wherever you go, you will go against your being, farther and farther away. You have gone already too far.\nIt is time to drop the idea of the way. Life is not a becoming, not some kind of process. It is being.\nYou cannot ask me how my way differs from the growth movement, because I have no way. I am not teaching you a way – really, I am taking you away from all the ways.\nBut the question has some significance. The growth movement was egoistic. It was the assertion of the ego repressed for centuries. Just by being assertive and egoistic you don’t start growing. Or worse, you start growing in a wrong way.\nMy movement is not egoistic. I am not here to make your ego more and more strong – it is already\ntoo strong. My movement is towards egolessness. That’s where I depart from the growth movement.\nAnd no one can grow by strengthening the ego. He will remain just an imaginary being; he will not come to know his authentic reality.\nThe ego is not you, it is a pretender. People need it because they don’t know who they are, and it is really difficult to live without having some idea of who you are; hence the ego comes into existence. It is a make-believe; it is constructed by you so that you don’t feel the vacuum, so that somehow you can manage to drag yourself to your grave.\nI want you to drop the ego and then see: you will be vast, there will be no limit to you. That is growth. To become a tiny, pygmy ego is not growth, it is just the opposite.\nThe growth movement should not be called a growth movement at all. It is selling phony commodities to you; it is really cutting your very roots. And if you become satisfied with the ego you will never search, seek, for your self, because you will continue to believe, “This ego is me.”\nIn Japan, for centuries it has been thought to be an art: great gardeners have been cutting the roots of trees. The tree is placed in a pot which has no bottom, so whenever the roots start growing, they just have to take up the pot and cut the roots. There are four-hundred-year-old trees only six inches high. I cannot conceive that this is art – this is murder. And those poor trees cannot say anything. If you don’t allow their roots to grow deeper into the earth, they will not grow higher into the heavens, towards the stars. The deeper their roots, the higher will be their growth.\nThe same is true about man. Nature functions in an absolutely harmonious way. There are not many ways that nature grows. It may be a tree, a bird, a man – it doesn’t matter, the principle, the law of growth remains the same: Let your roots go deeper.\nOf course, a tree is standing, does not move – it has no legs. There are a few trees in Africa which, out of sheer necessity, have had to move. The jungles in Africa are so thick, and the trees are so big that there is no chance for new trees to grow; the sun never reaches them. It is just a sheer question of life and death. And they start moving out of crowded spaces to find some place where they can also have the sun, the air, the moon, the earth. In Africa there are walking trees; they walk in their own way, and are very intelligent.\nForget the idea that man is the only intelligent being on the earth. Yes, just as a tree is different from your body, it is different from your intelligence. But it has its own kind of intelligence. It has been found that the trees which move always in the direction where more water is available, more sun is available, more air is available, more space is available. How do they know which direction to move, which path to take? And they never make any mistake.\nThey are not like Moses, who wandered for forty years with the poor Jews dying in the desert, finding Israel, the holy land promised to him by God himself. Forty years in the desert? Almost two-thirds of the Jews died on the way before they reached the place. I certainly say that it has nothing holy about it. But Moses was also tired and old. His people were almost finished, and the remaining ones were getting angry with him. They had lost all trust in him. He did not know where he was going. And in a desert it is very difficult to find a path; there are no roads, no paths.\nBut these trees are far more intelligent than Moses. They don’t wander here and there, they simply rush exactly to the point where they can survive, grow. In a few places where water pipelines are\nclose by, they don’t bother to go to a faraway place where they can find a river or a pond. They are\nvery progressive, more progressive than Mahatma Gandhi.\nThey drop the idea of going to the river, which their parents have always followed. They don’t care a bit about the past and the tradition; they rush towards the pipeline. And they are strong enough to break steel pipelines; they put their roots into the pipeline. Can you call these trees unintelligent? They have a different kind of intelligence.\nBut growth is possible only if you go deeper into your roots. You are not a tree; hence, you are not to grow your roots into the earth – that will be sheer death. You have to grow inwards. That is your earth. There you have to spread your roots, because there is your nourishment: your water, your sun, your air, your being.\nOnce you have found the center of your consciousness, growth happens of its own accord. It has not to be done, you have not to grow. It is just as when the tree gets nourishment, it starts growing: fresh leaves and flowers and branches suddenly start appearing.\nThe growth movement was not a growth movement. It started, of course, in California. Any nonsense... if you find it, and you want to trace where it started from, you have to go to California. It started in Esalen.\nOne of the directors of Esalen came to me, because he had become fed up. No growth was happening – and he was the director, so what about the poor fellows he was directing? He became a sannyasin here in America, and after one year he came to see me.\nAnd this is one of my experiences: these people who become accustomed to leading others, who become accustomed to the attitude that “I know, and you do not; therefore, follow me”.…\nThis director was directing the whole show in Esalen for many years. How many people he destroyed I don’t know, but he must have destroyed a lot. Reading my books.… First his young daughter became my sannyasin, because she was still unpolluted. She became my messenger in Esalen, she turned many Esalen people to sannyas. It was she who insisted that her father come to me, and he came.\nTo read my books, to listen to my tapes, is one thing. But to come to me and look eye to eye – it is very difficult.\nThe man’s name was Dick, and he proved a dick! Just within a few days he escaped without telling anybody. We looked for him – where had he gone? From Esalen I received his letter saying, “Yours is too dangerous a place.” He must have been thinking that growth is without risk, growth is just a game, a gimmick. Perhaps you have to read something, do a few stupid groups, and within a few weeks you are grown-up.\nGrowth is simple on the one hand – the simplest thing – and on the other hand the most difficult thing, almost impossible. The reason why it is so, is: it is simple if you have guts. It is so simple that nothing has to be done, you just have to become a little more ingoing, directed towards your inner reality. Just as you see things with open eyes, you have to close your eyes and see what is there. It is so simple.\nIt becomes dangerous because you have to lose many things. You have to lose all your past, your knowledgeability, your so-called growth. You have to lose everything that you have accumulated around you. It is all junk! If you cling to it, growth becomes impossible.\nThat man ran away from me. He still reads my books, he still listens to my tapes, but now I am so close, he has no courage to come back – because there in Esalen he is the director, and here he has to be nobody.\nEsalen is almost dead, it has seen its days of glory. People have deserted it – only a few people once in a while go there – because they could see the point: that in becoming egoistic they are creating a more miserable life for themselves. What is the point of growing up? – misery, agony, jealousy, competitiveness, violence... because if you are assertive, violence is not very far away from you. It is just behind you like a shadow; your assertiveness can become violence any moment. And with a strong ego it is bound to become your very way of life.\nI am not trying here to polish your egoistic mind. I am trying to demolish, not polish. I am trying to help camels to become lions! Of course, it is difficult for a camel to become a lion, but it is not impossible, because I have made many camels into lions.\nAnd once you become a lion, I have nothing to do. Your very lionhood will make you a child: simple, innocent, clean, pure, holy. That is growth. You have found the roots. And those roots are not just yours. You cannot claim, “These are my roots,” because your ego is no longer there to claim it. You have found the universal source of roots. You know now, perfectly well, that it is the same existence that blossoms in the rose, in the lotus, that moves the stars.\nIt is the same universe that is your energy too. You are not apart from existence, you are part of it. And the moment you realize that you are part of this beautiful universe, a great ecstasy surrounds you twenty-four hours a day.\nSo there is not only a difference between the so-called growth movement and what is happening here, they are diametrically opposite. The so-called growth movement is preventing people from growing. It consists only of camels. We are not interested in keeping you in the lowest grade of consciousness – camels, ugly. Nothing is straight in a camel; you cannot find a single straight line. Everything is as it should not be.\nThe lion has a beauty, tremendous beauty. If you have seen any statue, or a photograph or a drawing of the face of that great lion, Bodhidharma, you will be surprised looking at his eyes. Those eyes look so ferocious. The man was not like that, he was one of the most beautiful men who has walked on the earth. It is symbolic: those are the eyes of a lion.\nIt is a well-known fact that when the lion kills some animal, his method is hypnotism. He simply looks into the eyes of the animal, and the animal becomes hypnotized, stuck, frozen. He cannot escape, he cannot move. Trembling, he stands before the lion. The lion just has to keep hold of his eyes; through the eyes he prevents him from escaping. You will see in Bodhidharmas’s eyes the same flare, the same flame.\nMany people escape from me. Their whole lives they will escape; now this becomes their growth.\nThey waste their lives just escaping, and they can’t see a simple fact, that they are just cowards.\nThere was an opportunity to go through a transformation. Of course something has to be dropped, something has to be burned, something has to be completely forgotten; only then do you allow transformation to take place.\nThe master’s work is to transform camels into lions. Then things take their own course: the lion becomes a child without any effort. The lion has found the roots. The child is going to blossom into his being.\nHere, the sannyasins have to drop everything – and dropping everything you have saved yourself; otherwise you are going to be drowned in all the mud that you have accumulated. Your parents, your teachers, your priests, your culture, religion, society – they are all pouring mud on you. And it is a very sticky mud, you become glued to it.\nThe decision to become a sannyasin is a very great, momentous decision, because from that point you will have to leave everything that you thought was yours, and you will have to move into a new dimension where nothing belongs to you. On the contrary, you belong to the whole.\nDo you see the difference? When you say, “This belongs to me,” this is the language of the ego. And when you say, “I belong to the universe,” this is the language of egolessness. Then you are in a total let-go. If you belong to the universe, then it is the universe who is going to take care of you.\nI am saying it from my own experience. For thirty-two years I have been the poorest richest man in the world. And I don’t have anything that belongs to me, nothing belongs to me, but the phenomenon of belonging to the universe has created harmony out of a great contradiction. As far as belongings are concerned, I am the poorest man you can find. Even a beggar has something which belongs to him.\nI used to go to the university to teach. An old beggar was always there. The railway station was just in between my house and the university; the old beggar was always begging at the railway station, and he knew when I would be passing. He would come to the road and stand there. One day I was surprised – a young man was standing there, a young beggar. I said, “What happened to the old man?”\nHe said, “I got married to his daughter, and he has given me his place as the dowry. This is the best place in our profession! The railway station – so many new people coming and going – the university, so many people coming and going... there is nothing comparable to it.”\nSo I said, “What happened to him?”\nHe said, “Now he has moved to another spot.” The city had two stations, so he had moved to another station. And he was a very strong fellow; he must have thrown out the beggar who was thinking that that station belonged to him.\nNothing belongs to anybody, but even beggars are richer than me. Because I am not there, how can anything belong to me? And the moment I disappeared, my consciousness became part of the whole. I lost everything and I gained everything; hence I say, I am the poorest and the richest man. In these thirty-two years I have lived like a king, and I have not earned a single cent. The universe takes care. The universe is benevolent.\nYou are this universe’s children. Just become a child, and your eyes will be able to see the point. And from that moment, growth goes on happening; you go on and on. And there are no borders to existence. There are no borders to your growth either.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE JUST BEEN SAYING THAT THE WORDS OF THE MASTER BECOME MERE WORDS AFTER THE MASTER IS GONE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER YOU ARE GONE?\nDo you think my words are not already dead for you? First, think of that. The master is there, his words are there, but are those words alive for you? If they are alive for you, don’t be worried. You know the secret.\nIt is not the words. The master can be there and the words can be dead. So why can’t it happen the other way around? – the master is dead, but the words are still alive. It all depends on you. It is not a question of the master’s life or death, but how you relate to those words.\nYes, it is simpler when the master is there, only in one way. Because those words are spoken, they carry some flavor of the master’s heart. They carry a few beats of the master’s heart towards you. It is simple in this way. But on the other hand, when the master is alive, perhaps the words will never become alive to you, because you start taking the master for granted. Then the words are dead.\nIt happened in the second world war that Adolf Hitler declared that he was going to destroy the Tower of London. Millions of people rushed towards the tower – they had passed the tower thousands of times in their lives, but had never taken the trouble to see it. People come from all over the world to see the Tower of London, but Londoners take it for granted. The moment Hitler said he was going to destroy it, suddenly those people who had lived their whole lives in London became aware that the Tower of London could not be taken for granted anymore. They rushed to see it before this madman, Adolf Hitler, destroyed it.\nThe master is alive – but the disciple can take him for granted. You can take me for granted. Then those words are already dead, because your aliveness is not available. If you are capable of being alert, alive, responsive, it makes no difference: the master may be dead, but his words will go on resounding in you. Even the written words, which are dead, can become alive in you; you just have to open your heart.\nThe question is not of the master’s life and death, the question basically is of your response.\nSo don’t be worried about when I am gone. Those who are missing me now will be missing me then too – no loss. Those who are living my message now, they will go on living it. And if they go on living it, they cannot help but spread it. I am not depending on books – all the religions have depended on books – I am depending on you!\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say – very sadly, of course – that if even two hundred people are enlightened, they can make the whole world full of light, full of life. Just two hundred people can transform the whole character of humanity. He could not manage it, but what he said is true.\nI am going to manage it! I will not leave you unless I have made enough people enlightened so that they can make the whole world afire, alive. I am depending on you, not on any books. Those books may be helpful in some way to bring people to you, but my word will be throbbing in your heart; only then can you help anybody who comes to you.\nAnd it is so simple. I have more than half a million sannyasins in the world, and more than one million people who are just on the borderline – a little push and they will be sannyasins. One million more who are lovers but cannot drop their camelhood.…\nOn this big a scale, a worldwide scale, nobody has worked before. Gautam Buddha remained confined to the small state of Bihar in India – not even the whole of India. India has thirty states; Buddha remained confined to one space, one state. He did great work, but it was impossible to transform the whole quality of consciousness on the earth. The same is true about Jesus, Moses – anybody who has been trying.\nFor a simple reason I have been able to contact millions of people around the world: I am not confined to any tradition. I am not burdened by the past, I am completely weightless. So anybody who is burdened – and who is not burdened? – becomes interested in me, particularly the young people who are fed up with all the nonsense that is being taught in the churches and the synagogues, in the temples, in the mosques.\nAll these people, these churches, synagogues and mosques, are trying to bridge the gap. You have heard the phrase “generation gap.” Between you and the church, between you and the synagogue, there is not just a generation gap, there is a gap of hundreds of generations. And in trying to bridge it, they are proving themselves buffoons, because truth never compromises. It cannot – with whom will it compromise? Compromising truth means compromising with lies.\nAnd all these people have become afraid that young people are no longer interested; they don’t come to the synagogue, they don’t come to the church, so something should be done that can attract young people. Their whole business is going down.\nI have heard about three rabbis.… And by the way, don’t let me drift. Whenever I come across the word “rabbi” I immediately associate it with rubbish. These three rabbis were meeting, discussing, talking about great things. One rabbi said, “My synagogue is the most modern, because we allow people to smoke in the synagogue. There is no harm in it.”\nThe second rabbi said, “This is nothing, my synagogue is even more modern: we even allow people\nto make love in the synagogue. What is wrong with it?”\nThe third rabbi said, “This is nothing. My synagogue is the most avant-garde.” The two rabbis said, “Just tell us what you have done.”\nHe said, “My synagogue remains closed for Jewish holidays!”\nThey are trying hard, but it is just foolishness. They cannot catch hold of the new spirit of man.\nI don’t give you any tradition.\nI don’t give you any scripture.\nI don’t give you any discipline.\nThose are all non-essentials. I simply concentrate my whole work on making you more conscious. Consciousness is the key to transform the whole of humanity.\nAnd yes, Gurdjieff is right: if even two hundred people are aflame, enlightened, the whole world will become enlightened, because these two hundred torches can give fire to millions of people. Those people are also carrying torches, but without any fire. They have everything, just the fire is missing. And when fire passes from one torch to another, the first torch is not losing anything at all.\nThe enlightened consciousness is an infinite reservoir: it can give to you and yet it remains the same. Its quantity does not decrease, because it is not a question of quantity at all; it is a question of quality. Qualities can be shared without losing anything.\nYou can love as many people as you want – that does not mean one day you will go bankrupt, and you will have to declare, “Now I have no love.” You cannot go bankrupt as far as love is concerned. Yes, you can go bankrupt as far as money is concerned. Money is a quantity; love is a quality. What to say of enlightened consciousness? It is the highest quality possible; there is nothing higher than that.\nDon’t be afraid, worried that if I am gone, then what will happen to my words. I will not be gone before I have sown the seeds of those words in you. They are not mine! They are nobody’s. They are coming out of existence itself – I am simply a vehicle. You can become a vehicle. Everybody is capable of becoming a vehicle. Hence, I am not depending on old strategies; they have all failed. I am depending on living human beings.\nAnd that is the only way to save humanity without becoming a savior, to save humanity without creating in them greed for heaven and fear of hell. The only way to save humanity is to give them some taste of what it means to be enlightened, a little fragrance, so they can feel the invisible.\nAnd I am absolutely certain, utterly happy, that I have got the right people: people who are going to be my books, my temples, my synagogues. This is the reason I call this the first religion, because it depends on living human beings, not on dead holy scriptures, traditions, beliefs.\nI am giving you the taste of my being, and preparing you to do the same, on your part, to others. It all depends on you, whether my words will remain living or will die. As far as I am concerned, I do not care.\nWhile I am here, I am pouring myself into you. And I am grateful that you are allowing it to happen. Who bothers about the future? There is nobody in me who can care about the future. If existence can find me as a vehicle, I can remain assured that it can find thousands of people to be its vehicle.\nI am simply giving you a little opportunity to become vehicles of the whole. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI AM BRITISH, MISERABLE, UNENLIGHTENED, AND AN EX-SANNYASIN. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE LEFT FOR ME TO ACHIEVE?\nNo, sir! You have done everything. You have done really more than is possible. Now the only thing left for you is Krishnamurti Lake.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nIF YOU DEPART ON THE 6TH OF JULY OF ANY YEAR, ARE WE ALL GOING WITH YOU?\nNo, nobody is going with me. I am not Reverend Jim Jones, I am not even a Christian. The day I go, your responsibility to live becomes greater – to live me, to become me. All around the world all the communes have to understand it.\nIt is very easy to die with me. It is so easy that it is against my sannyasins’ dignity. I will not give you such any easy job. You have to live! And when I am not there, you have to live more consciously, more carefully – because who is going to spread me all over the world?\nRemember, dying is a very easy thing; it happens in a single moment. Living is the real challenge. My leaving the body will be a challenge for you, that now that I have left one body, I can be in all of your bodies; that now I am not speaking from one mouth, I can speak from millions of mouths.\nChristians have been cowards, not accepting the responsibility of Jonestown. They have created a religion which is death-oriented. My religion is life-oriented, I do not believe in death. In fact, there is no death. Nothing dies, it only transmigrates into new forms.\nThe enlightened person does not enter another life circle; he has nothing left to learn. The world is just a school. If you go on committing mistakes in unconsciousness, existence will give you millions of chances to come back again and again until you get awakened and drop your mistakes. That will be your last embodiment.\nI am not going to be reborn in a body, because that would be just idiotic. When I can live in the bodies of millions of my sannyasins, what is the point of again getting caged in one body? In fact, the enlightened consciousness simply spreads into all those who are available and open. It becomes universal.\nYou are not going with me, but I am coming within you! Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SPEAK OF REINCARNATION. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT, AND I DON’T WANT TO BELIEVE IN ANYTHING I DON’T EXPERIENCE. WHAT TO DO?\nWho is asking you to believe in reincarnation? And why are you concerned to do something about it? There must be some lingering belief. If you don’t believe in reincarnation, that is the full stop. Why bother about what to do?\nDon’t believe in reincarnation! Just live this incarnation, and you will come to experience that reincarnation is not theory, it is a reality. Just live this incarnation. Do you believe in this incarnation, or not? Reincarnation is either in the past or in the future, but you are here, alive. Life is throbbing in you.\nI know reincarnation is a truth. But I am not saying that you should believe it because I say so. Never believe anybody else’s experience; that is a hindrance. I can only say to you, just live this incarnation. That will open doors and you will be able to see backwards, you will be able to see forwards. And then it is up to you to believe in it or not. How can you disbelieve it then? But before that Let it become an experience.\nAll the religions are based on belief systems. I am giving you absolute freedom to enquire, to doubt, because that is the only way to experience on your own. And unless you experience on your own, there is no value at all in believing.\nYou love me. Naturally, if I say reincarnation is a truth, out of your love you may believe in me. Out of your love, how can you conceive that I may be telling something untruthful to you? You trust me.\nAnd this trust has been exploited for million of years, this love has been exploited by every religion. I am not going to exploit in any way. About whatsoever I have known I can open my heart to you, but remember not to fall in the trap of believing. Love is good, trust is good – but belief is poison. If you really love me, if you really trust me, then make every effort to experience what I am saying to you. I want enquirers, people who are capable of doubt, who are capable of asking questions.\nAll the religions have repressed people’s questions, their doubts, their enquiries. They say, “Don’t bring in all these things. We know. For you, all that is left is to believe.” That’s why you see the whole humanity in such a miserable, dark, dismal ignorance. The responsibility goes to the religions.\nYour love, I respect. For your trust, I am grateful. But these beautiful things should not be used as a strategy to make you a believer. I want you to be a knower. If you love me and trust me, then go on enquiring, searching, seeking. Till you have found, never believe. And I can say it with such certainty, because I know that if you enquire you will find it; it is there!\nThe other religions have been telling you to believe, because they are not certain that it is there. It is because of their own doubt that they are repressing your doubts. They are afraid that if you start doubting and asking and enquiring, you may not find any God, any reincarnation, any truth. Then their whole business – and it is the biggest business in the world – will simply disappear.\nAs far as I am concerned, not a single word from me has to be believed, but to be experienced. And I am giving you the method, how to experience it.\nBecome more meditative. Reincarnation and God, heaven and hell, do not matter. What matters is your becoming alert. Meditation awakens you, gives you eyes – and then whatever you see, you cannot deny.\nAs far as I am concerned, reincarnation is a truth, because in existence nothing dies. Even the physicist will say, about the objective world, that nothing dies. You can destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki – so much power science has given to chimpanzee politicians – but you cannot destroy a single drop of water.\nYou cannot destroy. Physicists have become aware of this impossibility. Whatever you do, only the form changes. You destroy a single dewdrop, and there is hydrogen and oxygen; they were its components. You cannot destroy hydrogen or oxygen. If you try, then from molecules you come to atoms. If you destroy the atom, you come to electrons. We don’t know right now if we can destroy the electron. Either you cannot destroy it – it is the ultimate objective constituent of reality – or if you can destroy it, then you will find something else. But nothing can be destroyed in the objective world.\nThe same is true about the world of consciousness, of life. There is no death. Death is only a change from one form into another form, and ultimately from form to formlessness. And that is the goal – because every form is a kind of imprisonment. Unless you become formless, you cannot get rid of misery, jealousy, anger, hatred, greed, fear, because these are concerned with your form.\nBut when you are formless, there is nothing that can harm you, there is nothing that you can lose any more, there is nothing that can be added to you. You have come to the ultimate realization.\nOnly Gautam Buddha has given the right word for this experience. In English it is difficult to translate it, because languages develop only after experience. It is just arbitrarily that I am calling it “enlightenment.” But it is very arbitrary; it does not really give you the sense that Buddha’s word gives. He calls it nirvana.\nI can explain the word to you. Nirvana means ceasing to be. Strange... ceasing to be. I could have used that word, but that would make you afraid. Already people are so much afraid of me – I, who have never done any harm to anybody.\nNot to be is nirvana. That does not mean that you are no more; it simply means you are no longer an entity, embodied. Yes, in that sense you are no more, but that is the way – not to be is the way to be all. The dewdrop drops into the ocean. You can say it has died, but those who know will say it has become oceanic. Now it is the whole ocean.\nExistence is alive at every stage. Nothing is dead. Even a stone – which you think seems to be completely dead – is not dead. So many living electrons are running so fast inside it that you cannot see them, but they are all living beings. Their bodies are so small that nobody has seen them; we don’t even have any scientific instrument to see the electron, it is only guesswork. We can see the effect; hence we think there must be a cause. The cause has not been seen, only the effect has been seen. But the electron is as alive as you are.\nThe whole existence is synonymous with life. Here nothing dies. Death is an impossibility.\nYes, things change from one form to another form till they become mature enough that they need not go to school again. Then they move into a formless life, then they become one with the ocean itself.\nCHAPTER 17\nThe death of the mind is the birth of you\n15 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nFOR THE LAST SIX YEARS I’VE LIVED IN YOUR COMMUNES. YOU ARE HERE, ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE; EVERYTHING I LOVE AND VALUE IS HERE. AND YET, I OFTEN THINK OF LEAVING. WHAT’S WRONG?\nThat’s what is wrong. You have all your friends here, all that you love, all that you have aspired to. When one comes to a point of having all, a great desire to escape from it arises – for the simple reason that the mind wants more and more and more. If all is available, the mind starts feeling restless; it has nothing to do.\nIt is a strange fact that poor countries and their people are more satisfied and contented, compared to the rich countries and their people, because the poor can hope and hopes keep them going. If you reach the final rung of the ladder, you are suddenly at a loss; you cannot hope anymore, there is nothing to hope for.\nThe mind and its functioning has to be understood; the continuous desire for more has to be understood. It is very sick.\nOne should start looking into one’s desire to leave when everything is available. Who is prompting this desire? The mind wants more, and there is no more anymore. The mind is bound to create turmoil in you to escape. And the dichotomy is that on the other hand you see, “All is available here.\nWhere am I going to be and what am I going to gain by going there?” It is sheer stupidity. But this\nmind comes from the monkeys and is stupid.\nYou have to learn not to be identified with the mind. You have to be just a watcher, and see all the buffoonery that the mind goes on doing around you. Don’t applaud, don’t support, don’t negate – just watch. Take no action against the mind because that is also part of the mind. Only one thing in you is the door, and that is witnessing, because it is not part of the mind. It is simple to understand: if you can witness your mind, certainly you are not the mind. Anything that you can see in front of you, you are not.\nThis is the whole simple and open secret of meditation. Whatever the monkey within you is doing, watch, with no judgment, because any judgment is either going to be for or against; you have become party to the foolishness of the mind. Neither for or against, just remain watchful of what is happening and this desire to leave will disappear, because you will be able to see that what you wanted is here. So where are you going? And this mind will be with you wherever you go, and it will not allow you any rest.\nThe mind always wants to go on and on, because that is its very lifeblood. Stopping, even for a single moment, the mind dies. And the death of the mind is the birth of you. While the mind has power over you, you are not born yet.\nAll the great masters in the East were either kings, or princes who were going to become kings. Buddha, Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Bahubali – what happened to these people? Not a single poor man in the whole history of the East has become a great master, for the simple reason that he still has hope.\nHope is your opium. It keeps you going. It is just there, you have to stretch your hand a little bit more. It is hanging just before you: a little effort and it will be yours. It is not going to be so; it will always go on hanging just there. It will not be too far because that may create the idea, “Perhaps I cannot manage to go that far. I don’t have the strength. The journey is very long.” So your hope is not very far away, just close enough so that it would be foolish not to get it. By the time you get it, it is still there in some different form.\nThat’s why religions in the East – particularly in India – have a flavor that religions which are not born there don’t have. In India, three religions have existed for thousands of years: Jainism is the oldest, then Hinduism, then Buddhism. Jainas have twenty-four tirthankaras, the great masters. But strangely enough, all twenty-four came from royal families. Either they were already kings or they were going to be kings sooner or later. And they escaped – they had everything, just at their fingertips they had the whole world. That was the problem; they had to escape.\nIn Buddhism there is a strange story – but worth understanding, because it is the story of each of you. When Buddha was born, the great astrologers said to the king, “We are afraid, but you have to be made aware of it: this newborn baby is either going to become a chakravartin” – a chakravartin means one who rules over the whole world – “or he is going to become a beggar who owns nothing.”\n... two extremes.\nThe king was old and this was his only son, born in his old age. He asked the astrologers how to prevent him from becoming a beggar and renouncing the world. Those astrologers had no idea of\nmind and psychology. Astrologers may have ideas about faraway stars, whose light takes millions of light years to reach the earth.… And what a foolishness, that man thinks his fate, his destiny, is determined by all these millions of stars so far away!\nThere is a reason why astrology has remained significant: it gives you great satisfaction that the whole universe is interested in you. Even the faraway stars are trying their best to do something to you; you are not an ordinary person, you are not nothing. Those faraway stars are not even aware of you, cannot be, but your ego feels tremendous satisfaction.\nAstrologers have been exploiting this since the very beginning of man. Of course, they exploit you, you have to pay for it, but it seems worth paying them; they are giving you a big ego. You are bigger, far more important, than the biggest star in the sky. They are all just revolving around you!\nBut those poor astrologers were not even as intelligent as Sigmund Freud. They told the king, “If you want him not to renounce the world, then a few arrangements have to be made.”\nIn India there are three clear-cut seasons in the year. Since the atomic explosions around the world, that has changed; otherwise, every year on the same day the rains will begin, and on the same day they will stop. On the same day the winter comes, and after four months on the same day it stops. For centuries it has been absolutely certain. Now it is not so, but in Buddha’s time it was certain.\nBuddha’s father made three palaces, one for each season. For summer, a palace in the hill station: cool, beautiful, green. Every care was taken that Buddha would never become disappointed with the world. For winter, a warm and cozy atmosphere was made in the palace.\nThe astrologers told the king, “From the very beginning let him be surrounded with beautiful girls, so by\nthe time he becomes a young man he has all the beautiful girls of the land.”\nThey even went into details: that he should not see any old man, because in his seeing an old man the question could arise in him, “Is this the destiny for everyone?” Never allow him to see a dead body. Keep him absolutely unaware of the realities of life, keep him in a dreamland. Their argument was, when he has everything, why should he renounce?\nThe greatest physician of the country was looking after him. Even the gardeners in the king’s garden were told that Buddha should not see a flower withering away or a leaf turning pale. In the night everything that indicates death had to be removed. He should see only beautiful flowers which are always young. He should see only green leaves which are always green.\nAnd this the king could manage. He managed it – and his management backfired. Those idiotic astrologers had no idea of a simple fact: that if you give a man everything and keep him unaware of all that is ugly around, soon he is going to be fed up with it. Soon he will start thinking, “Is this all? Then tomorrow is going to be the same, and the day after tomorrow is going to be the same. What is the point?” He will become bored.\nAnd that’s what happened. Buddha became bored with unchanging beautiful women, unchanging beautiful flowers. How long can your mind keep silent? The astrologers were the reason why Buddha renounced the kingdom. If he had been allowed to live just the ordinary life of every man, perhaps\nthere would have been no Buddha. In a way, the idiotic astrologers unknowingly did a great service to humanity.\nThe story is beautiful. There used to be an annual festival in the capital, and the prince who was going to be king used to inaugurate it, declare it open. It lasted for a few weeks – all kinds of things, all kinds of athletic games, shows. Buddha was going to inaugurate this youth festival in his twenty- ninth year.\nOn the way every care was taken – but existence has a way to reach you. You cannot remain completely closed in a grave, unless you are dead. If you are alive, there are bound to be loopholes from where existence will enter and make you aware of the reality. The astrologers and the kings could not be more intelligent than existence itself.\nEvery care was taken that on the way from the palace to the festival stadium, no old men should be seen, no dead bodies should be carried – nothing that could create a questioning in Buddha. But you cannot avoid reality for long. As the chariot was going towards the festival grounds, Buddha saw an old man. The old man was deaf and he had not heard that today he was not to pass on this road, he was to remain in the house or go somewhere else. He was deaf, he could not hear it, so just as usual he came out of his house; he was going to purchase something from the market.\nBuddha, for the first time in twenty-nine years, saw an old man just on the borderline of death. He asked his charioteer, “What is the matter? What has happened to this man? I have never seen anything like this!”\nThe charioteer loved Buddha just as his own son. He could not lie. He said, “Although it is going against the orders of your father, I cannot lie to you. You have been prevented from seeing people getting old. Everybody gets old – I will get old. This is the way of life.”\nBuddha immediately asked, “Am I also going to be old one day just like this man?”\nThe charioteer said, “I have to say the truth to you: I would like that this should not happen to you, but it is the law of nature; nothing can be done. Just as from childhood you have become a young man, from youth you will become one day old too.”\nAnd then, just then, somebody died. Now you cannot prevent death. You cannot order death, “You are not to happen on this road, you can happen anywhere else.” Death is not in your hands. Somebody died, people were crying, and the dead body was there.\nBuddha asked, “What has happened? Why are people crying?” He had never seen anybody crying, he had never seen anybody with tears; he had never seen anybody dead. He asked, “What has happened to this man? He is not even breathing!”\nThe charioteer said, “This is the second stage. First you saw the old man. Soon death will come to him too. It has come to this man.”\nBuddha asked, “Am I also going to die one day?”\nThe charioteer – afraid of the king, but he must have been a man of some integrity – said, “Truth is truth, nobody can deny it. Your father the king is going to die, I am going to die, you are going to die. Death begins the day you are born. After birth there is no way to escape death.”\nAnd just then they passed a sannyasin. Astrologers had said to the king, “Your son should not be allowed any contact with sannyasins, because those are the people who have renounced everything. Those are the people who teach that this world is illusion, that all your desires are going to lead you nowhere, that you are simply wasting your life, and death is coming close by every moment. Sannyasins have to be avoided.” And for twenty-nine years Buddha had no notion that there are people who are trying to find something which is beyond life and death.\nThis red-clothed sannyasin looked very strange to him – just as when you move into the world outside the commune you look strange to people. They are living a life of dreams. You suddenly come, and you shock them! Questions, enquiries: “What has happened to you? Why are you wearing a red robe?”\nAnd a man who has not seen a sannyasin his whole life, for twenty-nine years, is bound to be more enquiring. He said, “And what about this man? I have seen people, but nobody wears a loose robe like this, with a begging bowl in his hand. What kind of man is he?”\nThe charioteer said, “This man has understood that beauty is going to turn into ugliness, that youth is going to turn into old age, that life is going to turn into death, and he is trying to find, ‘Is there something eternal? Is there something which is not affected by youth, by old age, by death, by disease?’ He is a sannyasin, he has renounced the ordinary world. He\nis a seeker of truth.”\nThey were just reaching the stadium. Buddha said to the charioteer, “Turn back – I am not going to the youth festival. If youth is finally going to become old age, disease, death, and if this is going to happen to me, then I have lost twenty-nine years uselessly. I have lived in dreams. I am no longer young, and I am no longer interested in being the prince. Tonight I am going to renounce this world and be a seeker of truth.”\nWhat the astrologers had thought looked like common sense... but common sense is superficial. They could not think a simple thing: that you cannot keep a man for his whole life unaware of reality. It is better to let him know from the very beginning; otherwise it will come as a big explosion in his life. And that’s what happened. That very night Buddha escaped from the palace where everything was available.\nIn India, all these three religions’ great masters come from royalty. That’s why there is a great difference, almost unbridgeable, between Christianity and Buddhism, between Mohammedanism and Jainism. The difference comes because Jesus is not a prince. He comes from a poor family, he is the son of a poor carpenter, Joseph. He knows all, nothing is hidden from him. His religion is going to be the poor man’s religion. No wonder all around the world poor people go on turning into Christians.\nIn India, I have traveled continually trying to find a single rich man who became a Christian, and I have not found one. Those who become Christians are orphans, beggars, starving people. Of\ncourse they cannot understand Buddhism because Buddha does not turn stones into bread, and that’s what they want. Buddha does not change water into wine; on the contrary, he prohibits you because any alcoholic drug is going to destroy your meditativeness. He is not going to raise a dead man from the grave and bring him back to life. What is the point – he will go again. Why give him trouble?\nDo you know what happened to Lazarus?\nEven if Jesus raised him from the dead – which is nonsenseFor the argument’s sake if we accept\nthat yes, he was raised from death back to life, then what happened to him? Where is Lazarus? He will have to die again so what is the point? Maybe a few years more of misery and poverty, sickness, anxiety and anguish – and you call it a miracle? And again he will be back in the grave. At least in the grave he will be without anxiety, without poverty, without sickness, and without any fear of death. It has already happened, now it cannot happen again. Jesus really was unkind if he did raise Lazarus from death.\nBuddha would not do it. It is not a miracle, it is foolishness. A similar case happened in Buddha’s life: a young child died; the father had died, and the woman was living only for this child. That young child was her whole life and her only hope; otherwise, there was nothing for her to live for. And the child died. She was almost on the verge of going crazy. She wouldn’t allow people to take the child to the crematorium. She was hugging the child in the hope that perhaps he might start breathing again. She was ready to give her life if the child could live.\nThe people said, “This is not possible, it is against the law of nature.” But she was in such misery, she could not listen to anybody. Then somebody said, “The best way is, let us take this woman to Gautam Buddha who, just by chance, is in the village.”\nThis appealed to the woman. A man like Gautam Buddha can do anything, and this is a small miracle – nothing much – that the child starts breathing again. She went, crying and weeping, put the child’s dead body at the feet of Buddha, and asked him, “You are a great master, you know the secrets of life and death, and I have come with great hope. Make my child alive again.”\nBuddha said, “That I will do, but you have to fulfill a condition before I do it.”\nShe said, “I am ready to fulfill any condition. I am ready to give my life, but let my child live.”\nBuddha said, “No, the condition you have to fulfill is very simple. You just go around the village and find a few mustard seeds from a house where death has never happened.”\nShe was in such despair, she went from one house to another. And those people said, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want, but those mustard seeds will not help you. Not only one, but many have died in our family; perhaps thousands have died.”\nBy the evening, a great awakening had happened to the woman. She had gone through the whole\nvillage, and the same replyThey were all ready to help her but they said, “These mustard seeds won’t help. Buddha has made it clear to you, ‘Bring the mustard seeds from a family where nobody has ever died.’”\nBy the evening, when she returned, she was a totally different woman. She was not the same woman who had come in the morning. She had become absolutely aware that death is a reality of life – it cannot be changed. And what is the point? “Even if my child lives for a few years, he will have to die again. In the first place it is not possible; in the second place, even if it were possible, it is pointless.”\nNow there were no more tears in her eyes, she was very quiet, serene. A tremendous understanding had come to her: that she was asking for the impossible. She dropped that desire. She came and fell at Buddha’s feet.\nBuddha said, “Where are the mustard seeds? I have been waiting the whole day.”\nThe woman instead of crying, laughed. She said, “You played a good joke. Forget all about the child, what is gone is gone. Now I have come to be initiated and to become a sannyasin. The way you have found the truth which never dies, I also want to find. I am no longer concerned with the child or anybody else. My concern is now, how to find the truth which never dies, which is life itself.”\nBuddha said, “Forgive me that I had to ask you for something I knew was impossible. But it was a\nsimple device to bring you to your senses, and it worked.”\nI call this a miracle. Lazarus being raised from the grave is not a miracle; it is just a bogus story created by the Christians to make their master appear as the greatest master in the world, who can do such miracles, who can walk on water. Nobody can walk on water. I find it difficult even to walk on the ground! Do you want me to walk on water? I will become enlightened again!\nOne very rich, super-rich Jew was visiting Jerusalem in the holy land, Israel, and he was going around seeing all the places. He saw Lake Galilee where Jesus used to walk on water. He did not believe it – he was a Jew, he was not a Christian. But he told the boatman that he would like to go around the lake – it is a really beautiful place.\nThe boatman was a Christian. He had no idea that this man is a Jew because Israel is a holy land for Christians too, and Christians are coming daily to the boatman to take them around the lake where Jesus walked. This water is no longer ordinary water; this lake is no longer an ordinary lake. Jesus walking on it has made it something holy, something divine.\nBut he could not see that the man was a Jew, not a Christian... only Christians used to come there. One thing he could see: that he was American, rich – he has come in a big limousine. So he raised his price. Ordinarily he was asking only one dollar to go all around the lake; he asked for twenty dollars.\nThe Jew said, “My God, twenty dollars! Now I know why Jesus used to walk on water – for the first time I have discovered the truth. From where would that poor guy get twenty dollars? Of course he had to walk on water! I am not going to walk on water, and I am not going to give you twenty dollars either!”\nChristianity and Mohammedanism are the two religions born outside of India. Mohammed was also a very poor man, uneducated, just capable of somehow managing two meals a day. He was a\nshepherd – not metaphorically, as Jesus goes on calling himself the shepherd and you the sheep. Mohammed was actually a shepherd; that was his job.\nMohammedanism and Christianity are the two religions created by poor people. They don’t have that elegance, that delicacy, that flavor, that comes from meditation. They don’t have even the word “meditation” in their vocabulary. They are the religions of prayer.\nPrayer makes you a beggar; meditation makes you a master. Prayer is a degradation: you are humiliating yourself, falling on your knees, folding your hands towards the sky, knowing nothing of what you are doing. And what do you ask in your prayer? “Give us more wealth, give us more life, give us more health.” What else can you ask?\nAnd religion is not for those who ask. Religion is for those who give. But to give in the first place you have to have. You have to experience the life that is flowing in you; you have to experience the consciousness that you are. Then suddenly you are no longer a beggar and prayer becomes absolutely absurd. There is no one to whom the prayer can be addressed, and there is no need – even if someone is there – because meditation opens the doors to your own treasures.\nUnless you are in a meditative state, this mind of yours will go on being a beggar. You may have everything, but the mind wants more. That is what I mean by being a beggar: always wanting more, more, more And there is no end to it.\nMeditation does not desire for anything. There is no idea of more. Meditation simply wants to know, “What is in me? If I can discover my own center, I have discovered the center of all” – because the center of you is not only the center of you. On the circumference we are different, but at the center... there is only one center, it is universal. It is at the center that I and you and everybody meet and become one.\nIt is easy to understand your desire, that you have everything here – but that is the trouble. What do you want? – that things should be taken away from you so you can start again and not feel stuck? No, more and more will be given to you. And that is creating a dichotomy, because on the other hand, you would not like to lose what you have got. That is the schizophrenic nature of the mind.\nAll minds are schizophrenic. Mind as such is sick. Mind creates a split in you: you would like to have all this, all that is available here, so you cannot go away. And you have everything that you wanted available to you, and the mind wants more. You have to decide and choose between mind and meditation. Mind is a beggar, and meditation is a master.\nBecome master of your own self. And I would like you to become more and more rich in every dimension, because I accept life in its totality. I would like my commune to be the richest, to be the most intelligent, to be in the best of health. I would like my commune to change into paradise. But that is possible only if you drop this crazy mind which goes on asking for more. And it is only a question of simply understanding and shifting your energies from the mind to the witnessing consciousness. Don’t be identified with the mind, because you are not it, you are the witness.\nWithout knowing it, your question itself makes it clear that you are a witness. You are witnessing that you have everything here, there is no need to go anywhere – and anyway you cannot go. This\nis your home, these people are your people. You cannot find so much love and life and laughter anywhere in the world. So you cannot go. But once in a while the mind will create the disturbance and say, “Here you are just stuck. Nothing is happening.”\nI am answering the question because it happens to many people, and they go on writing to me, “What to do? I would just like to go in the outside world for a few days, the mind is going crazy. I don’t want to miss anything, and I know I am not going to get anything there, but what to do with the mind? It says, ‘Just go for a three week holiday. Go to the beach.’” And during all those three weeks on the beach, your mind will say, “What are you doing here? You are an idiot! All that was beautiful, lovable, you have left behind.”\nIn fact, we are constantly enjoying a holiday. Where can you go? If there is anything missing here, we are able to create it, to bring it here. Rather than you going to the beach, we can bring the beach here! And that will be far better, because one person going on a holiday... you will miss your friends, and you will miss this great family.\nAnd you will find you are just an outsider there. You will not be able to mix with the people outside the commune. You have changed so much that you and they are living in two different worlds. They will not be able to understand you, nor will you be able to understand them.\nDrop the mind. Move towards the witness. Then you will be immensely attuned with the milieu here. If anything is missing, so many intelligent people can create it. And we have to create something that the whole world feels jealous of!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nON MY WAY FROM THE CITY OF RAJNEESH TO RAJNEESHPURAM, I SAW MANY SIGNS ALONG THE ROAD WHICH ARE AGAINST YOU. THE LAST ONE, JUST BEFORE THE TURN TO RAJNEESHPURAM, SAID, “ALL YOU WHO ENTER HERE SHALL GIVE UP HOPE.” IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING TO HOPE FOR?\nThose fanatic Christians are writing all these things, but they don’t know that these things are not against me. They have written what I am teaching you! You are entering here; there is no hope, no hope even of getting out from here!\nThose idiots who have written that will be thinking that this will stop you entering Rajneeshpuram. In fact it is an invitation, because hope brings hopelessness, sure and certain. All hopelessness in man exists because he hopes.\nYou have heard the proverb: Man proposes and God disposes. There is no God who disposes. Man certainly proposes, and hopes that it will be fulfilled. Nature has no obligation to fulfill your desires, crazy demands. Existence is available only for those who have dropped hope, because every hope is against existence.\nDo you see the point? Every hope is against existence. Every prayer is against existence. You are asking for something that existence has not given to you. You are trying to get something that existence is not willing to give you. Perhaps you don’t deserve it.\nI don’t teach you hope, because to teach hope means that following the hope, just like a shadow,\nwith be hopelessness. I teach you to enjoy whatsoever is.\nHope is always in the future, and you are always in the present. How can there be a bridge between the hope and you? Existence is here, hope is there – the bridge is not possible. Every hope is going to be frustrated. If you enjoy being frustrated, if you love to be hopeless, then you can hope as much as you like.\nIf you want to be blissful, to be blessed, then all hopes have to be dropped. Just visualize for a single\nmoment that you don’t have any hope. Immediately you can see hopelessness also disappears.\nIt is a very significant question. If you ask for the meaning of life you will feel meaninglessness. Jean-Paul Sartre feels life is meaningless. Life is neither meaningless nor meaningful, life simply is. But if you try to find some meaning in it, naturally that meaning is not there. You are the creator of your meaninglessness. And then despair, anguish.…\nLife simply is. Enjoy it! Why hope? When life is here, you are wasting your life and time in hoping, and then one day you will find those hopes cannot be fulfilled. Then you will suffer hopelessness. This is all your own creation: hope, hopelessness; meaning, meaninglessness.\nI don’t have any hope. That does not mean hopelessness. Hopelessness is the other side of hope. Throw away the coin of hope and the hopelessness is thrown away too. You cannot save one – you cannot have a one-sided coin – the other side will be there. You can go on deceiving yourself, but for how long? And whom are you kidding? Just wasting your life.…\nPeople have been asking me, “What is the meaning of life?” Now, if I say there is no meaning, they feel sad. It is not life that is making them sad, it is their stupid question – “What is the meaning of life?” – that is creating the sadness.\nI don’t ask for the meaning. Why should there be any meaning? What is the meaning of a roseflower? But it blossoms, releases its fragrance. What is its hope? Is the roseflower hoping that somebody will come and say, “How beautiful!” That somebody will pass by and say, “What fragrance!” No, the roseflower even flowers in a place where nobody passes by, nobody sees it, nobody feels it.\nIn the Himalayas there is a place, a valley, which is called the Valley of the Gods, for the simple reason that it is impossible to go deep down into that valley – steep hills surround it. But in that valley where nobody goes – there is no way to go, no path, and it is so deep that you can only see it from the hilltop – in that valley there have been growing for millennia, beautiful flowers. I have seen it. I think there must be many flowers which are not even known to us, which are not even named by the scientists.\nThe valley is completely just flowers and flowers. For whom are they blossoming? For whom are they waiting? What is their hope? There is no hope, there is no desire. They are not waiting for somebody, they are simply enjoying themselves blossoming to their completion. They are enjoying the sun, they are enjoying the hills, they are enjoying the other flowers blossoming all around. They are enjoying the moon in the night, and the stars in the night. But remember, there is no meaning and there is no hope.\nDestroy all hope in you and you will never be hopeless, you will never feel hopelessness. Drop the enquiry into the meaning of life and you will never feel it is meaningless. I am not saying that you will start feeling it is meaningful, no. You will be freed completely from meaning and meaninglessness, from hope and hopelessness. And there is no need for them. You can just enjoy.\nAnd the whole existence is enjoying except man. Something is crazy about man. The trees must be laughing at you; the rocks must be thinking, “What has happened to you? Why this sadness?” The birds must be thinking, “This whole humanity has gone mad.” And it has gone mad.\nSanity is to enjoy the moment. Whatever it brings to you, relish, rejoice. I teach you the moment and its joys, and I want you to completely drop dreaming about hopes. Your dreams about hopes have helped you to be exploited by the priests. They give you the hope; they say, “This life is hopeless, but there is a life beyond the grave.”\nStrange... everything is beyond the grave and nobody comes back from the grave to say, “Yes, the priests are right.” Not a single man has come back from the grave to say, “These priests are perfectly right: all that you are hoping for, desiring for, is abundantly available in the kingdom of God – but that kingdom of God is beyond the grave.” My kingdom of godliness is here, now, this very moment. Who cares about tomorrow?\nOnly people who are living in despair cling to hope. That hope keeps them dragging on: “If it is not happening today, it will happen tomorrow; it is just a question of a little more waiting.” But you are waiting for Godot, who is never going to come.\nIn fact, existence is pouring on you all its treasures this very moment, but you are not here! You are digging in the future, and the future is only a projection of your mind.\nThose who cannot think of the future start thinking of the past. Old people are afraid: death is coming, tomorrow is death! And their whole life and its experience has raised many doubts in them: who knows whether after death all that you wanted will be available? There is not a single eyewitness. The old man starts being afraid of death. He turns his eyes towards the past which he has lived – he starts remembering the beautiful days of youth, the wonderful days of childhood.\nAnd I tell you, he is inventing it. When he was a child, he was as miserable as anything. When he was a young man, he was burdened with all kinds of miseries and problems. Now that death is coming near, he cannot look forward – there is only the darkness of the grave. He turns his back towards the grave and starts looking at the past, which he has not lived, which he has missed! A strange phenomenon... when you are a child you are wanting to grow up and become a young person because young people are enjoying so much.\nI used to go for a morning walk, and there was a post office nearby. I knew the postmaster, I knew his family. One day, early in the morning – it must have been five o’clock, it was still dark – I saw a small boy with a mustache passing by my side. I could not believe that a small boy... I ran after him and caught hold of him, and he said, “Please don’t tell my father.”\nBut I said, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “Whenever I see somebody with a mustache, I feel so bad that I don’t have any mustache. I have purchased this, but don’t tell my father. I enjoy it very much.”\nI said, “What else do you enjoy? I will not tell your father.”\nHe said, “Promise?” I said, “Promise.”\nHe took out a pack of cigarettes. He said, “I enjoy cigarettes, although I start coughing and the taste\nis bad. But what to do? One has to enjoy. So many people smoking And I am waiting to come of age, but it is coming so slowly.”\nIn old age this boy will remember, “Wonderful were the days of my childhood,” and that will be simply\nimagination.\nAll that is real is here.\nWhether you are a child, or a young man, a young woman, or an old man, or on your deathbed, all that is to be experienced is here. And here is the only time, and the only place. There is no “there” anywhere, past or future. There is no “then” past or future. It is always here, now.\nJust the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin – of course he is from California. He is a man but he wants to wear the clothes of a woman. He says he enjoys it so much but he is afraid that somebody will find out. So, closing his doors, he puts on women’s clothes. He was asking me, “Is it okay? And can I move in the commune in women’s clothes?”\nNo woman is enjoying her clothes, and this guy is enjoying women’s clothes! I receive letters from women saying that they want to change their sex, they want to become men. What can you say to these fools? Can’t you see the men all around you? And it is happening in the world: men are changing their sex, becoming women; women are changing their sex and becoming men. What could be the cause of this?\nYou cannot enjoy whatsoever you are, wherever you are. You are always thinking that the other guy is smarter, that men are enjoying, that women are enjoying. You are all in the same ship – and nobody is enjoying. And of course, once you have changed your sex from a man and become a woman, you cannot say that now you are not enjoying it; that would look very stupid. You went through such a process – painful operations, plastic surgery – and now to say that it was useless would not be right. You brag that you are enjoying, that it has been a great experience.\nI cannot conceive that a man becoming a woman or a woman becoming a man can be a great experience. It is bragging. You have done something stupid; now to accept the stupidity of it is embarrassing, it is better now to go on pretending. But I know... People who have changed their sex have written to me that there is nothing great in it, it is the same, you just change one place for another place. But you are the same, because you are not your body, you are not your mind. You are consciousness, and no plastic surgery can change your consciousness – your consciousness will remain the same.\nThe only way to become blissful is to raise your consciousness from its dormant position. It is fast asleep, because you have never bothered about it. You are searching all over the world, leaving only one spot that is deep within you, and the key is there.\nMy whole effort in creating communes all around the world is to make you aware of this tremendous gift of existence, these flowers that are showering continuously on you. But your eyes are focused somewhere else.\nYou are closed to the present; that is the only misery, the only hell. Be open to the moment; that is the only heaven and the only blessed state.\nCHAPTER 18\nSilence does the miracle\n16 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nARE THESE ILLUSIONS OF GOD AND EGO ONE AND THE SAME?\nYes. The moment ego is found illusory, immediately God also disappears. Ego is an imaginary center in individuals, and God is the imaginary center of the whole universe. They are related to each other, dependent on each other. Neither God can exist without ego in you, nor can ego exist without God there above, in heaven. God is the ego of the whole.\nIt is not a coincidence that all the religions emphasize both together – God and you. They try to make your ego more and more – at least in appearance – a reality. To make the ego they have all kinds of disciplines: you have to do this, you have not to do this – because the ego cannot exist when you are not doing anything.\nIt is just as if you have a torch of fire in your hand; if you go on moving it round and round fast enough, you will see a circle of fire – which does not exist. It is illusory, you just cannot see the gaps. It is just a single fire, a flame, but moved fast it becomes a circle. That circle is simply not there. Stop moving your hand and the circle disappears.\nAll the religions go on teaching you, “Do something – fast, exercises, prayers; go to churches, mosques, synagogues. Read the holy scripture every day.” These are all methods to create the ego in you. The torch goes on moving and goes on creating the illusory circle.\nAnd when you start feeling that you have a center in you, it becomes very easy for you to believe that there must be a center to the whole. If each individual is moving on a center, then the whole existence must be moving on a center, and that center is God. Ego strengthened in you creates the belief, the faith in – God, and makes it look very logical.\nWhat I am doing here is just the opposite. I want you first to learn moments of non-doing, moments when you simply are, not doing anything – the torch has stopped moving in a circle – and you are amazed. The moment you are silent, not doing anything at all, suddenly, in a strange, mysterious way, the old you has disappeared, evaporated, and a new feeling of being arises.\nThe ego is separate from others, has to be. It has its own territory. The bigger the territory, the bigger ego you can have. If you become the president of America, of course your ego becomes millions of times bigger. You have much money, and you go on and on accumulating money – that feeds the illusion; your territory, your power, goes on increasing.\nI want you to know a state of utter nothingness. That is your reality.\nThe child is not born with an ego. Ego is being taught by the society, religion, culture. You must have watched little babies: they don’t say, “I am hungry.” If the baby’s name is Bob, he says, “Bob is hungry. Bob wants to go to the toilet.” He has no sense of “I”. He indicates himself also in the third person. Bob is something that people call him, so he also calls himself Bob. But a day will come... as he grows you will start teaching him that this is not right. “Bob is the name for others to call you; you have to stop calling yourself Bob. You are a separate personality, you have to learn to call yourself ‘I’.”\nThe day Bob becomes “I,” he loses the reality of being and falls into the dark abysmal pit of an hallucination. Once he calls himself “I” there is a totally different energy functioning. Now the “I” wants to grow, it wants to become big; it wants this, it wants that. It wants to rise higher and higher in the world of hierarchies. It wants a bigger territorial imperative.\nIf somebody has a bigger “I” than you, it creates an inferiority complex in you. You make every effort to be superior-than-thou, holier-than-thou, bigger-than-thou. Now your whole life is dedicated to one stupid thing – which does not exist in the first place. You are on a dream path. You will go on moving, making your “I” bigger, and bigger. And it creates almost all your problems.\nEven Alexander the Great had immense problems. The “I” within him wanted to be the world conqueror, and he had almost conquered the world. I say almost for two reasons. In his time, half of the world was not known, America was not known. Secondly, he entered India, but he could not conquer India; he returned from the boundaries.\nHe was not very old, he was just thirty-three. But in these thirty-three years he had been simply fighting, fighting, fighting. He had become sick, bored with the fight, killing, murder, blood. He wanted to go back home and rest, and even that was not fulfilled. He could not reach his home in Athens. He died just one day before he was supposed to reach Athens; Athens was only twenty-four hours away.\nBut his whole life’s experience – growing richer, bigger, more and more powerful, and then also feeling an utter helplessness, not even capable of postponing his death for twenty-four hours And\nhe had promised his mother that once he had conquered the world he would come and put the whole world at her feet as a gift. No son had done that for any mother before, so it was something absolutely unique that he was going to do.\nBut he felt helpless, surrounded by the best physicians. They all said, “You cannot survive. This twenty-four hour journey... you will die. It is better to rest here, perhaps there is a chance. But don’t move. We don’t see much chance even for resting – you are drowning. You are getting closer and closer, not to your home, but to your death; not to your home, but to your grave.\n“And we cannot help. We can cure sicknesses, we cannot cure death. And this is not sickness. You are almost like a spent cartridge. In thirty-three years you have spent all your life energy in fighting this nation, that nation. You have wasted your life. It is not sickness, it is simply that your life energy is spent, and spent uselessly.”\nAlexander was a very intelligent man. He was a disciple of the great logician and philosopher, Aristotle; Aristotle was his private tutor. He died before reaching the capital. Before his death he told his commander in chief, “This is my last wish, and this has to be fulfilled.” What was his last wish? A very strange wish. The wish was, “When you carry my coffin to the grave, you have to keep both my hands hanging out of the coffin.”\nThe commander in chief asked, “What kind of wish is this? Hands are always kept inside the coffin.\nNobody has ever heard of a coffin being carried to the grave with the hands hanging out!”\nAlexander said, “I don’t have much breath to explain to you, but in short, I want to show to the world that I am going with empty hands. I was thinking I was becoming bigger and bigger, richer and richer, but in fact, I was becoming poorer and poorer. When I was born I had come into the world with my fists closed, as if I was holding something within my fists. Now at the moment of death, I cannot go with my fists closed.”\nTo keep your fists closed you need life, some energy. No dead man has been able to keep his hands closed. Who will close them? A dead man is no longer there, all energy is gone – the hands open of their own accord.\n“Let everybody know that Alexander the Great is dying with his hands empty, just a beggar.”\nBut I don’t see that anybody has learned from those empty hands, because people after Alexander\nhave continued to do the same in different ways.\nMan’s ego is the source of all his problems, all the wars, all the conflicts, all the jealousies, fear, depression. Feeling oneself as a failure, continuously comparing with others makes everybody hurt – and hurt tremendously, because you can’t have everything. Somebody is more beautiful than you, that hurts; somebody has more money that you, that hurts; somebody is more knowledgeable than you, that hurts. Millions of things are there to hurt you, but you don’t know, it is not those things that are hurting you, because they don’t hurt me. They are hurting you because of your ego.\nEgo is constantly trembling with fear, knowing perfectly well that it is an artifact, an artificial device created by the society to keep you running, chasing shadows. The politicians are happy, they want\nyou to go on running. This game of the ego, reaching higher and higher, is politics. The priest is happy, you go on asking for his blessings.\nOne of my friends was a cabinet minister in Indira Gandhi’s time. When his election was coming near, he was very much afraid whether he was going to win again or not. And now, being a cabinet minister, he was hoping someday to become the prime minister. And to lose the election and again be just nobody was very painful.\nHe came to me. He said, “I have never asked anything from you, but this time, you bless me. I want to win this election. There is every possibility that I will go higher in the cabinet. Perhaps I may become the deputy prime minister.”\nI said, “You have come to the wrong place” – because in India people go to the saints for blessings. I said, “You have come to the wrong place. If I really give you a blessing, you will fail utterly in your election.”\nHe said, “What do you mean? What kind of blessing is this?”\nI said, “Your becoming a cabinet minister, a deputy prime minister, or even a prime minister, is not really a blessing to you. You are going in an hallucinatory direction. My blessing will bring you back to your reality.”\nIn India, many couples, when they got married, used to come for my blessing. And Vivek used to tell them, “Don’t ask for his blessing, because his blessing means divorce” – because she had seen, year by year, whoever had asked for my blessing was finished, asking for my blessing was the end of the relationship. But they could not understand it. They had come to ask the blessing that for their lives they remain devoted to each other, that their love goes on growing, their love should not know any end, it should be endless.\nBut this is illusory. Everything that is born, dies. And the more beautiful a thing is, the more delicate it is. Love is a beautiful flower; it withers very easily. Yes, a relationship you can carry – that is legal, social – but it will be a burden when the love between you has stopped flowing. You will torture each other in every possible way.\nMy blessing can be that you enjoy the moment to the fullest, and if in the next moment you feel the bridge has collapsed, then say good-bye to each other – at least in a friendly, compassionate way.\nThe ego and all its games... marriage is its game, money is its game, power is its game. All the games are the games of ego. The society up to now has remained playing games; it is an ongoing Olympics all over the world. Everybody is fighting his way upwards, and everybody else is pulling his legs down, because at the Everest peak there is not enough space for you all to stand.\nIt is a cut-throat competition. And it becomes so important to you, that you forget completely that this ego was planted in you by the society, by the teachers. From the kindergarten to the university, what are they doing? – strengthening your ego. More and more degrees go on being added to your name, and you start feeling bigger and bigger and bigger.\nEgo is the greatest lie – which you have accepted as a truth. But all vested interests are very much in favor of it, because if everybody becomes aware of egolessness, this whole Olympics going on around the world will simply come to a standstill. Nobody will want to climb Everest, they will enjoy wherever they are. They will be rejoicing.\nThe ego keeps you waiting: tomorrow when you succeed, you will rejoice. Today, of course, you have to suffer, you have to sacrifice. If you want to succeed tomorrow, today you have to sacrifice. You have to deserve success, and for that you are doing every kind of gymnastics. And it is only a question of a little time to suffer, and then there is rejoicing. But that tomorrow never comes. It has never come.\nTomorrow simply means that which never comes. It is postponing living. It is a beautiful strategy to keep you suffering. Politicians want you to suffer, priests want you to suffer, your educational system wants you to suffer. They all teach you that sacrifice is great: Sacrifice – only then will you be able to find something to rejoice in; sacrifice is the way.\nI say it categorically, No! Sacrifice is the invention of the cunning people. There is no need to sacrifice anything because all that you need to rejoice is already here within you.\nBut the ego cannot rejoice in the present. It cannot exist in the present; it exists only in the future, in the past – that which is not. The past is no more, the future is not yet; both are non-existential. Ego can exist only with the non-existential, because it itself is non-existent.\nIn the present, pure moment you will find no ego in you – simply a silent joy, a silent and pure nothingness.\nBut the priest is afraid: if you come to know this nothingness, you will know immediately there is no God, because if you can exist without any crystallized center, why cannot the whole existence exist the same way?\nGod is nothing but your ego multiplied by everybody else’s ego. God is the biggest ego in the world. God is the greatest hallucination man has suffered, and is still suffering. If you want your ego, then you have to keep your belief in God intact. They remain together, they go together.\nMany questions have come to me, asking why I insistently destroy people’s belief and faith in God. It is pure arithmetic: without destroying God I cannot help you to destroy your ego. If there is no God and existence can remain flowing, moving, growing, expanding; nobody is controlling it, nobody is maintaining it, it is autonomous.…\nThat’s what I mean when I say there is no God. I am saying existence is autonomous. Trees are growing of their own accord, birds are flying of their own accord, the sun is rising of its own accord. And it is beautiful that nobody is behind this beautiful existence, turning it into a puppeteer’s show. That’s what the religions teach – all the religions without exception – that you are only a puppet. With God there, you cannot be anything more than a puppet. The strings are in his hand.\nThey have a proverb in India that not even a leaf moves without God’s permission. Nothing happens without God’s permission, so this whole existence is a permanent slavery. And it is very strange, the\nsame people who say, “Not even a leaf moves without his support” Then how do people commit\nmurder? Then how do people commit rape? Then how do people become thieves? If not even a leaf moves without him, the murderer is not responsible, the rapist is not responsible. If anybody is responsible, it is the puppeteer.\nBut strange... you will be punished for an act over which you have no control. You will be thrown into hell because God managed to make a murderer of you. It is God who manages Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini. It is God. If one million Jews are killed by Adolf Hitler, religions have no guts to say the truth: that it is God who is pulling the strings of Adolf Hitler – the poor puppet – and he is killing people.\nReligions want you to be responsible for your acts on the one hand, and on the other hand, God has created you, and everything that is in you is created by God.\nI have asked many saints, “How do you reconcile this contradiction?” and I have never received any answer. They said, “It is beyond human comprehension.” You can comprehend God, that he created the world. You can comprehend that a particular sin will throw you into hell, another particular act will take you to heaven. You can comprehend everything else.…\nI have seen in India, in temples, there are maps hanging which show where hell is, where heaven is, where God lives, his house. These idiots who made these maps didn’t know anything about America, because those maps were made thousands of years ago. Even now they are hanging – without America! They knew about heaven and hell, and they didn’t know anything about this very earth on which they were living.\nYour ego is just an idea implanted in your mind. It is poisonous. Your ego keeps driving you madder and madder.\nWhat I call meditation is nothing but a great decision on your part to have a few moments at least when you are not doing anything – not even thinking anything, because that is also an act. You simply are. In that simple existence you will find no ego inside you, and it will bring such clarity. Because all the turmoil of the ego is no longer there, your vision takes wings, you can see that God is nothing but the ego of the whole universe.\nIf you can exist, breathe, be, and there is no sense of “I,” it makes clear to you that there is no need for any God, that there is no need for this slavery under which we have all lived for millennia, that you are not a puppet, that you are an individual. And nobody is responsible for your acts, remember. That is very significant.\nWhy did people decide to remain slaves for so long? Why did they continue to believe in God, repressing their doubts and queries? – for the simple reason that the presence of God makes you irresponsible. He is the all-knower, he is everywhere; you are just to follow his commandments.\nAnd there are people like Moses who say that they have seen God, heard him, and they bring stone tablets with commandments written on them. They say, “This is God’s own handwriting.” Of course, he knew only Hebrew, that’s why he wrote the commandments in Hebrew. And he gave his commandments to Moses because the Jews are his chosen people.\nThis fiction that Moses created is responsible for all the miseries Jews have suffered all through history. If you carry the idea that you are the chosen people of God, then naturally you are superior to everybody. As a by-product you are making everybody your enemy. And the Jews are still carrying the same idea. God has been used by priests and prophets and messiahs to keep you deluded, deceived. But why did you accept all kinds of nonsense? There is a reason: it relieves you of all responsibility.\nWhen you are with me, I make you responsible for every act. And if there is no God, and you are a free individual, naturally you have to be very alert and awake, because there is no one protecting you from on high. Even Jesus was under that delusion. On the cross he was crying, “God, my Lord! Have you forsaken me?” He was thinking that God was behind him; that was giving him an illusory strength and power. His authority was because he was God’s messenger.\nJesus was fully convinced that on the cross God was going to come down and prove to the whole world that Jesus was his only begotten son; and those who were crucifying him would suffer in hell for eternity, and those who were with him would be raised in glory to heaven, to enjoy it forever.\nThese deluded people are your messiahs. These people need psychiatric treatment! Instead of putting them in a madhouse, you have been worshipping them. Why? The same reason: they relieve you of a great thing – responsibility. They take your responsibility on their own shoulders; and of course, they have a direct communication line with God.\nI want you to be silent, meditative, searching inside yourself, looking... is anyone there? And you will be surprised – there is no one, just pure existence, autonomous. There is no entity in you. You are part and parcel of the whole existence. You are connected to the trees and to the rivers and to the ocean in a thousand and one ways – visible, invisible. You are not separate.\nCan you remain alive without breathing? Perhaps for a few seconds you can manage, because you have a certain storage of oxygen in your lungs. So it is not a big deal that you can keep your nose closed and you can dive in water for a few seconds. But soon you start feeling suffocated; a little more and you will be finished. What are you doing when you close your nose? You are disconnecting yourself from the atmosphere, the air, that surrounds you. It is invisible, but it is very tangible. You can feel it with your hand. You are constantly taking it in, sending it out. It is there.\nEighty percent of your body is water – and not just water, but sea water. That’s why you are constantly in need, not only of ordinary water, you have to have sea water. That’s why salt is one of the most necessary things in the world. In your body, inside, it is exactly the same combination of salt water and other chemicals as in sea water.\nWhen you go to the beach, why do you feel a sudden joy? The salty breeze, the vast ocean. the waves. Why do you suddenly feel more alive? Because you are part of it. Eighty percent of you is\npart of the ocean! There is a certain need for your body, once in a while, to be close to the ocean so you can renew your love affair with it.\nWhy do you feel good looking at the green trees? When you go to a lush, green forest something in you starts dancing. The cool breeze, the green color surrounding you Do you know that trees are\nconstantly supplying you with oxygen, that you are constantly supplying carbon dioxide to the trees, that you are not separate – you are connected by very invisible bridges.\nOn the full moon night, you can see the ocean is affected: its waves are bigger, as if it wants to touch the moon. Something in the ocean is stirred by the full moon. It is now an established scientific fact that your great oceans – the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian ocean – all your great oceans are really the places from where the earth was removed to make the moon.\nIn the beginning the earth was not solid, and when something is not solid and is moving, spinning, it will throw off a few parts of itself automatically because they are loose, they are not solid. The earth has thrown off millions of its parts. When you see a star falling in the night, it is not a star, it is just some part of the earth that has been floating beyond the gravitation of the earth and has come back into the area of gravitation. Two hundred miles around the earth is its area of magnetism. Every night thousands of those stones enter, and this has been going on for millions of years. Still they are not exhausted.\nThe biggest part thrown off by the earth, was the moon. Of course, if such a big part drops out, it leaves big holes on the earth. These holes became oceans, water collected in them. On the full moon night something in the earth remembers, something in the ocean stirs. They are still in communication.\nAnd you must remember that on the full moon night you also feel very good. Poets for centuries have been writing poetry about the full moon. Singers have been singing, musicians have been playing on their instruments to the glory of the full moon. Why does this full moon attract you? Because you are also eighty percent ocean.\nMore people go mad on the full moon night than any other night. More people commit suicide on the full moon night than any other night. More people have become enlightened on the full moon night than any other night. It cannot be just coincidence – for millions of years the same thing.…\nGautam Buddha was born on full moon night; he became enlightened on full moon night – the same full moon night, the same month. And he died on the same full moon night, the same month. He must have been really in deep communication with the moon. It is not visible; everything need not be visible.\nWe are connected with the whole universe. The moment your ego disappears, this connection with the whole becomes absolutely certain. There is no need to worship – you are then worshipping yourself. There is no need to pray. To whom are you praying? Then what is left for you is to rejoice, to enjoy all the gifts of existence. They are your inheritance! They belong to you, you belong to them.\nThere will be a totally different humanity if all the egos disappear. This whole earth will become a disco – Zorba the Buddha. People will be dancing, singing, enjoying. And there is so much to enjoy that who bothers about having a big post in the government? A few idiots may do that, but nobody will be jealous of them. And if you are not jealous of them, their joy at holding the big post of the president or the prime minister will be finished. Nobody cares! Ronald Reagan passes by and you don’t even say “Hi.”\nSooner or later those idiots will also come to their senses. What has happened? Nobody is recognizing them, nobody is bothering who they are. And everybody is so blissful.\nEgo disappearing, God disappears. Ego disappearing, hope disappears, despair disappears. Ego disappearing, there is no hell, no heaven. Ego disappearing, you become part of the universe, as you really are.\nTo me, this is enlightenment, this is liberation. Nobody can do it on your behalf. That’s why I say people like Jesus are talking nonsense – that they have come to save others, they are saviors. And it is not only Jesus, all the religions have their own buffoons.\nNobody can do it for you, you will have to do it for yourself, you will have to take the responsibility. Whatever the society has forcibly implanted in you, you have to undo it.\nSilence does the miracle. That’s why I say, yes, absolutely yes: your ego and God are not separate. God is the ego of the whole; your ego is the ego of the part. And the vested interests would like you to continue carrying the ego, because if the ego disappears, God disappears. All churches, all temples, mosques, gurudwaras, will have to be turned into discos where people come to dance and sing and play. That will be true religion.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY IS IT THAT WE WANT APPROVAL?\nIt is simple. from the very beginning a child is told what is right, what is wrong. He is never given freedom to choose on his own. He is taught principles; he is not allowed to enquire and to find out himself. And of course, whenever he does anything on his own, he is disapproved of by the family, by the society, by the school, by everybody. He becomes shaky. Just to do anything on your own is not accepted by the society. You need approval for everything.\nWhen I was a small child, as far back as I can remember, I could not understand it. I said, “It is my\nlife, I am going to live it. You have lived your life. Why should you impose things upon me?”\nThere used to be an annual fair a few miles away from my town. I went there without asking my family. For three days I enjoyed the place. It was by the side of a very big and beautiful river, and there were so many magicians and dancers and dramas Those three days just passed so quickly.\nWhen I came back home, everybody was angry. My father asked me, “If you wanted to go to the fair, why didn’t you ask?”\nI said, “Because I wanted to go. If you are honest enough, tell me: if I had asked would you have said yes? Just be honest, at least once.” And I looked into his eyes. For a moment there was silence. I said, “Your silence has said much.”\nHe said, “Perhaps you are right; I would not have allowed you to go there because there is gambling,\nprostitutes, and all kinds of ugly things. I would not have allowed you to go there.”\nSo I said, “Things are clear. I wanted to go – that’s why I did not ask. And from now on,” I told him, “remember, whatever I want to do I will not ask you. Whatever I don’t want to do, perhaps I may ask you, because I am always contrary.”\nI wanted to cross the river – in the rainy season it becomes so big, it is a mountainous river. In summer it shrinks and becomes small. In rainy seasons, suddenly it becomes vast.\nI wanted to swim. I went – it was risky. When I came back home... because it took me six hours to go to the other side. You cannot swim straight in a mountainous river; the water is going down so forcefully that you can reach to the other shore only three, four miles down. Then four miles you have to walk – not four miles, you have to walk eight miles. And then again you can swim back to the place from where you had started. They thought I must have drowned because by the time I reached home they were all searching with boats, looking for my dead body.\nI said, “What are you doing?”\nThey said, “We could not believe that you would do it. You should have asked!”\nI said, “I wanted to do it. Whether I die or remain alive does not matter. Whatever I want to do, I am ready to pay for it; it is my responsibility. I am not to be dominated, I am not a puppet.”\nI had to struggle constantly with my family – and they were all well-wishers. I had to fight constantly with my teachers, with my professors, with my vice-chancellors – and they were all well-wishers. Their intention was not bad, they wanted to help me. But to everybody I made it absolutely clear all through my life that I didn’t want to be helped, because that creates dependence.\nOne of my professors – he is now retired, so I can say the truth... Professor S.S. Roy retired as head of the department of philosophy in Allahabad University. He was my professor, and he was very much concerned; he loved me, he wanted me to become somebody. And I told him, “I am not going to become somebody, I don’t have that desire. I want to become nobody.”\nHe said, “Don’t talk like that. The examinations are coming, and I know you don’t have any textbooks.”\nI never purchased any textbooks. I purchased thousands of books – in my library when I left India, there were one hundred fifty thousand books of rare value – but I never purchased a single textbook.\nHe knew it. Just when the examinations were to begin, he called me. “Tomorrow morning,” he said, “your examinations are to begin, and this is the questionnaire that you have to answer. So please sit with me and answer me, because I want to know I have set these questions, this paper has been\nmade by me, so you answer me, one by one, so that I am certain that you will not fail – at least in\nmy paper. It will be a shame if you fail in my paper.”\nI said, “You don’t be worried.” I took that questionnaire and just threw it out the window, tearing it into\npieces.\nHe said, “What are you doing?”\nI said, “I am going to answer the questions. Whether I pass or fail does not matter. What matters is that I do not want to be dependent – that will keep me burdened my whole life. You love me, I can understand it, but your love is not very much if it cannot understand what I have done. I have\nnot seen those questions; I want to see them tomorrow morning in the examination hall. And finally\nthose copies will be coming to you; then you can see my answers.”\nHe said, “I gave you the whole paper – which is illegal, criminal; I risked my prestige for you. But I should have known before, because I know the type of a person you are. I can understand,” he said, “you don’t want to be obliged.”\nI said, “That’s true. Neither do I want to be obliged, nor do I want to oblige anybody else in the world. Everybody should be on his own, choose his way. I would rather go to hell, but not losing my freedom, than to heaven, being directed by somebody else.”\nYou are asking why we go on seeking the approval of others. It is because you are uncertain of yourself. You have been brought up in such a way that uncertainty has become your very second nature. Somebody with authority, power, prestige, approves of you, then you feel good, then you know that you must be right. You cannot decide on your own, because from the very childhood whatever you did on your own was found wrong and you were punished for it. That child is still there; just your body has grown. But your mind is somewhere in your childhood, still seeking approval.\nSomeday you have to stop it. The day you stop it, you start growing. If you don’t stop it you will remain a child even when you are dying – a hundred years old and you will still be a child. Even while dying you will need approval.\nAt the death moment, when it is coming close, immediately the priest is called, the bishop comes, the maulvi is called, the pundit comes; and they start giving you great advice for the future life. They won’t allow you even to die freely. They have not allowed you in your life to live freely, how can they allow you to die freely?\nIn fact, you also would not like to die freely, because you don’t know; now you are entering into an unknown dimension. You need someone who knows, who can give you courage, who can say, “Don’t be worried, only the body dies; your soul will still remain.” If you are a Hindu the advice will be different, but the basic thing is the same – that you cannot die in freedom.\nSometimes it happens, a person suddenly dies. The person is dead; by sheer accident he died in freedom without any priest around. But these priests of all the religions are really the jailers of your consciousness. The person has died but the ritual will be done. If you are Hindu, the mantras of the VEDAS will be recited – and the man is no more! Water from the holy Ganges will be poured in the mouth of the corpse, because Hindus believe that the water of the holy Ganges takes you into heaven.\nThey have this fiction that the Ganges is really a river of heaven. One great ascetic, Baghirath, prayed to God, did all kinds of austerities possible, tortured himself as much you can imagine, and prayed, “I will continue my austerities until you send the Ganges to the earth.” And he succeeded: the Ganges came down from heaven to the earth. That’s why its water is heavenly, it is pure.\nIf you drink it before death it will take you to heaven. So in every Hindu family they preserve the Ganges water. Who knows? – any time somebody can die. It is good if he drinks it before he dies. If by accident he misses, then no harm – you can drop a little water into his mouth, hoping that he will go to heaven. Even after death you are not going to allow freedom.\nFreedom comes as a by-product of meditation.\nOnce you start knowing your inner being, you have then the insight of what has to be done and what has not to be done. And it comes from your own still, small voice. It can be heard only in silence. For the first time you start moving in freedom, living in freedom. And remember, the slave – particularly the psychological slave – cannot know of any rejoicing, any blessing. He wants approval. Approval of whom?\nI asked my father, my teachers, my professors, “Are you certain what you are saying is right?” – because in the world there are so many cultures, so many religions, and they are all certain and they are all contradicting each other. They cannot all be true. They all can be false, but they cannot all be true. And how to decide who is right? Perhaps one is right, but how to decide?”\nAnd I have never received an answer that satisfied me. Then I told them, “Then let me alone. You yourself are uncertain. You start quoting the VEDAS, THE BIBLE, the KORAN; you are seeking approval. But what are the grounds for the certainty that Mohammed was not mad?”\nA very simple person can see that these things that Mohammed is saying cannot be right. Mohammed says every man can have four wives. Now, in the world there are not four times more women than men, they are equal. Nature keeps the balance. If one man marries four wives, he takes away three men’s right to be married. Now three persons have to remain celibate their whole life; they have been forced to remain celibate. They are bound to become perverts; they will find some way to express their sexuality. I don’t see that Mohammed is saying anything which makes sense.\nHindus say that when the husband dies, the wife has to jump into the funeral pyre of her husband; then only does she prove that she was sincere towards her husband. For thousands of years, millions of women had to jump alive into the funeral pyre of a husband who had done nothing except beat them and make them pregnant continuously. And they were treated just like cattle.\nShe should rejoice that that dodo is dead. On the contrary, she is forced.… And they had made arrangements, because alive... just think of yourself jumping into the fire – you will try to come out of it. So there were brahmin priests around the fire with burning torches to push her back. And so much purified butter was poured into the funeral pyre that there was smoke surrounding the whole area, so nobody could see what the priests were doing.\nIn the second circle, there was another group of priests who were chanting the VEDAS so loudly that the poor woman’s screams would be lost. Yes, you can find the authority for this in the Hindu scriptures, but the very thing is ugly, inhuman. And whoever has written that was not a man of sanity. He was a male chauvinist; he was not interested in human values.\nIf the woman refused... and a few women were courageous enough to refuse, they didn’t want to die. Yes, they loved their husband, but that does not mean that they had to die with the husband. They loved him, but they were not going to commit suicide. These women were treated very badly. They could not marry again. Manu, the greatest Hindu authority on all kinds of things, says they cannot marry again.\nStrange – a man can marry again, and a man is not asked to jump into the funeral pyre of his wife. Anybody can see the point, that this is simply fascist on the part of men. This Manu is not a man of truth, a man of silence, a man of wisdom. You will be surprised, Manu’s book is five thousand years old. Even Hindus who believe in it feel a little bit ashamed because there are many things in it which make them feel ashamed.\nBut Friedrich Nietzsche – who was the philosophical source of Adolf Hitler’s fascism – respects Manu as he respects nobody else. Adolf Hitler declared Manu one of the most significant authorities as far as morality is concerned. And these are not Hindus. You can see the relationship: these are fascists, and Manu approves of all kinds of fascism.\nThe Hindu widow remains alive in a very ugly way – if she chooses to remain alive. Her hair is cut so that she does not look beautiful. She cannot use any ornaments, because the man for whom she was supposed to look beautiful is dead. She cannot use any colored clothes, only white. All her hair, which is one of the most beautiful parts of a woman – is shaved. That hair gives a certain individuality to each woman.\nShe cannot use any cosmetics, she cannot use any ornaments. Even the cheapest glass bangles have to be broken. She has to hit her hands on the earth, on the wall, on the stone, to break the glass bangles. It brings blood to her hands. She cannot go in any place where celebration is happening. She cannot participate in any marriage, she cannot participate in any festival. She has to remain isolated, and she has to be treated just like a servant.\nShe does all kinds of things like a servant – utterly degraded, deprived of her humanity. You cannot see such humiliation anywhere. It would have been far better to have jumped into the fire – within minutes things would have ended. Now this woman has to suffer perhaps fifty years, sixty years. She will be just a living corpse.\nIf you ask the professor, as I used to ask, “What do you say?” – because Hindus believe Manu is a Maharishi, a great seer. And I say, “he must be the greatest blind man ever! Seer, my foot! This is the law that he has given to the Hindus. You go on finding approval in scriptures – and you don’t know who wrote those scriptures, what kind of people they were.”\nNeither any man can be the source of approval, nor can any scripture be the source of approval. You have to listen to your own inner voice, and move accordingly.\nThat’s the way of the sannyasin.\nCHAPTER 19\nDeeper and deeper into the mysterious, the miraculous\n17 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nOUTSIDE, THEN INSIDE – BEAUTY, UTTER BEAUTY. IS THERE MORE?\nThere is no end to it. There is infinitely more. You cannot exhaust it.\nBut one condition has to be remembered: You should not ask for it. You should not see it, because it comes on its own. It is not a desire from your side. Desire kills it. It is the abundance of existence that simply goes on flowering towards you if you are available.\nJust remain available, and there will be more and more and more. But from your mind, the idea of getting more has to be dropped entirely. The moment you ask for more there will be less. If you become too ambitious, there is every possibility you will lose it completely.\nSo it is a slightly delicate matter. You keep your doors and windows open and enjoy whatsoever happens. And so much happens that you cannot conceive more is possible, but when more happens you will be surprised. And this more goes on happening. BUt remember the word “happening.” It is nothing like an effort, a plan, a project on your part. You have to be just an empty receiver.\nJust as water flows downwards towards the ocean, beauty, truth, love – all that is valuable in existence – flows towards a person who is nobody.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI WISH THERE WAS ONLY YOU AND NO COMMUNE. I FEEL WINGS WHEN I SEE YOU, BUT AGGRESSIVE AND HELPLESS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNE. AND THIS MAKES ME FEEL UNHAPPY AND ASHAMED. EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS SO CLEAR TO ME, AND YET I HAVE THE FEELING THAT I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL. WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME?\nMuch is the matter with you.\nThere are half a million sannyasins around the world. Everybody wants the same thing you are asking, that he should possess me totally, that there should be nobody else who shares me. But please, think of me too. Just you and me Are you bent upon boring me to death? And remember,\nthis is the desire of every sannyasin. You have to understand it. Why this fear and helplessness with the commune?\nThe commune is nothing but my expanded being. If you really love me, you will automatically love the commune. If you are feeling beautiful winds blowing when I am with you, then in the commune you will feel even more, because I am there in many forms. I have lost my personality completely. I am just an opening. Whoever enters into me also becomes part of the infinite.\nIf you are somehow fearful and detest the commune, that simply means you have not yet come close to me – not at all. You say you feel you understand me clearly, every word that I utter, you understand it, and yet you have the feeling that you don’t understand me at all. Your second part is right, you don’t understand me at all. You only understand the words that I speak. And the words that I speak are just simple, ordinary, day-to-day use words. Anybody can understand those words. I am not a scholar, I am not a theologian. I am not crazy enough to be esoteric.\nI am speaking to you – not even giving a discourse. It is just a heart-to-heart talk. Words you understand – that gives you the misconception. To understand my words is not the real thing. There is something more between the words, between the lines, in the moments when I suddenly pause in the middle of a sentence. If you understand those pauses, those moments of silence, those gaps between two words, no dictionary is needed. No dictionary can manage to explain those gaps, those intervals.\nThat wordlessness is my real message.\nI am using words only to create wordlessness as a contrast. Forget everything that I have told you, but remember all those moments when I was silent. It is a strange way of speaking – nobody speaks that way. But when I stop, you are also in a stop waiting, awaiting what I am going to say. Catch\nthose wordless moments. I am there, and you will find yourself also there.\nTHE BIBLE says, “In the beginning there was the word.” This is sheer stupidity. In the beginning – if there was any beginning – there was wordlessness. THE BIBLE says, “And the word was with God.” What kind of reasoning is this? First you say, “In the beginning there was only the word.” Then from where does this God come? And THE BIBLE says not only this, it says, “The word was with God and the word was God.” It is just the opposite of reality.\nIn the beginning there was wordlessness – and there was no God with wordlessness. And the question of God being one with wordlessness is absolutely stupid, because “god” itself is a word and nothing else.\nThat silence was not only in the beginning; it is in the middle too, it is in the end too. It is always. It surrounds you twenty-four hours a day. But the difficulty is, not only a single word but millions of words are with you. They make a very thick wall between you and existence. You are encaged in words – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. The sermons in the churches, in the synagogues, are just words.\nI am not giving you a sermon, I am simply creating a device, using two words to make you aware of the pause in between; only then will you understand. And it is not a question of understanding me, understanding is simply understanding.\nWhen you bring a lighted torch into a dark room, it shows you the whole room, all that is there: the paintings on the walls, the furniture, the floor, the ceiling. Understanding is a quality in you. It has not to be connected with me. It is not linear, it is multidimensional. The moment you understand, the whole existence is an open book for you. Then all the mystifications of the religions disappear. Remember, I am saying “mystifications,” I am not saying the “mysteries.”\nIn fact, when all the mystifications of the religions disappear and you suddenly find yourself just in a moment of understanding, life is an open book, but tremendously mysterious. When mystifications are no longer there, then there is mystery. Then each moment of your life is a mystery, and every moment of your life goes on leading you deeper and deeper into the mysterious, the miraculous.\nAll the religions have committed a great crime against humanity. They have tried to explain to you what is not explainable. In their effort to explain to you the mystery of life, they have really explained it away. By inventing a God they destroyed the mystery of creativity. They created a God as creator; they continually conditioned you that existence is the creation. But existence is not schizophrenic, it is not split in two – the creator and the creation – it is simply creativity.\nHence I say to you that sometimes poets, singers, dancers, have come very close to the mystery – but I don’t recall any saint, theologian, philosopher having come close to the mystery of existence. In fact, their whole attempt is to demystify existence. They are trying to put before you a certain dogma which explains everything and leaves nothing for you. Those are mere words, empty, ugly.\nI don’t want to give you words; you are already burdened too much. I want to take all words from you. And I am using words for a very strange reason – because if you have a thorn in your foot, you have to use another thorn to take it out. I am destroying your words by my words, and giving you a chance continuously to listen to the pauses, the silent moments.\nYou are right that you feel you understand my words – anybody can do that. I don’t use big words, I don’t use any jargon. And you are also right that the feeling arises that you don’t understand me at all. You will have to choose. Either you go on understanding my words and become a great pundit, a scholar... and a scholar is farthest away from existence. You may become very knowledgeable, but your knowledge is just an effort to cover up your ignorance.\nBut if you choose the silent periods, then suddenly all the mysteries of life become available to you – not as explanations; you don’t get reality as an answer, you get it as an experience. And with that mystery you also become a mystery.\nThis is not ignorance, this is innocence. You become the child.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND I FEEL REALLY ATTRACTED TO DEATH. THIS DISTURBS ME, BUT AT THE SAME TIME GIVES ME JOY. WILL YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT?\nThis is great! One can commit suicide only once, and you have attempted many times – and you are still alive. Those attempts were not true, they were all bogus, and you knew it even then.\nI have heard.… Mulla Nasruddin wanted to commit suicide. Being a man of great cleverness, he made all the arrangements, left no loopholes. Perhaps nobody else had attempted suicide in that way.\nHe went on top of a hill, taking a pistol with him. Just underneath the hill, deep down, was a river, very dangerous, deep, and surrounded by all kinds of rocks. On the hill there was a tree – he had also brought a rope. Not to take any chances, he figured out all the possible things so that suicide was absolutely certain. He also carried with him a big container full of kerosene oil.\nHe hanged himself from the tree, but because he was going to do many more things, he could not take his feet from the earth – because then how was he going to do other things? So he was hanging from the tree and standing on the earth. Then he poured kerosene oil over himself; he had brought a lighter too. He created a fire, the kerosene oil was burning all around him. But he was not a man to take any chances, so he also shot a bullet into his head. But the bullet cut the rope, he fell down into the river, and the river water destroyed the fire!\nDesperately, he was coming back home when I met him. I asked, “You are still alive after all that arrangement?”\nHe said, “What to do? I know how to swim!” Everything failed!\nYou say you have attempted suicide many times. One thing is certain: you don’t want to commit suicide, you want to play with the idea. And you feel also that there is fear about death and there is also a certain joy. This is not only your situation. It is a very common human phenomenon.\nLife is a torture, a burden; it is anguish. One wants to get rid of it. To get rid of it means getting rid of all the anguish, the despair, the hopelessness, the meaninglessness – this wife, this husband, these kids, this job. Hence there is an attraction towards death, because death will put an end to all your misery. But it will also put an end to you – that creates fear.\nYou really want to live, and live forever, but you want to live in paradise. And you are living in a hell! You want to get rid of the hell, you don’t want to get rid of yourself. And I want to emphasize that you are your own hell. So suicide is attractive from one side in that it will put an end to all your miseries, but on the other hand there is a great fear: it will finish you too.\nIsn’t there some way that the miseries can be finished and you can live more intensely?\nI also teach you that a certain suicide can help you – the suicide of the ego, not of you. Let the ego die, and then see that with it all problems disappear. You are left full of joy, blessedness, and each moment goes on opening new doors to new mysteries. Each moment becomes a moment of discovery – and it is an unending process.\nYou have attempted so many times to commit suicide. This time you commit suicide my style. And anyway, you have failed so much that you must have become very much of an expert in failing. And deep down you don’t want to die because you are afraid of death – which is natural. Why should one put an end to one’s life when life has not even been lived? You have not even tasted it, you have not explored the multidimensional beauties, joys and blessings of life.\nNaturally you are afraid. But still you go on attempting it, because you don’t know how to get rid of all the miseries. Suicide seems to be the simplest way. You are in a split: half of your mind says, “Commit suicide and be finished with all this nonsense – enough is enough.” The other part tries to sabotage your effort, because the other part wants to live. You have not lived yet.\nSuicide is not going to help. Only more life, more abundant life, is going to help. So this time kill the ego, and see the miracle happen. With the ego gone, there is no misery, no anguish, and no need to commit suicide. With the ego gone, all the doors that were closed by the ego suddenly open and you are available to the sun, to the moon, to the stars.\nAnd it is easier, because to kill the ego you don’t need a pistol, kerosene oil, a rope to hang the ego, fire to burn the ego, and if everything fails, then a deep mountainous river underneath to finish the ego. You don’t need any of these things, because the ego is only a creation of the society, of the religions, of the culture. It does not exist in fact. You have only to look deeply into it; it is a shadow. You have to look into it, and it is not there.\nMeditation is simply a method of looking into what this ego is. And whoever has ever looked in has not found it. Without any exception, throughout the history of man, whoever has looked inwards has not come across any ego.\nThis is the suicide of the ego. Nothing has to be done, just a little turning in. And once you know it is not there, then all the sufferings that you were carrying because of a non-existential ego disappear. They cannot have any nourishment anymore. All these things have been created in your mind by conditioning, by programming; that’s what the society has done to you. We have lived the whole of history in an ugly way.\nOne of my professors did not agree with me, that something can be created by other people when it is\nnot there at all. So I said, “I will show it to you.”\nI was very much loved by the man; his wife was also very loving towards me. I went to his wife and told her, “Tomorrow morning when the professor gets up, you have to pretend that you are shocked, and say to him, ‘What has happened to you? When you went to bed you were perfectly okay; now your face is looking pale. Are you sick or something?’”\nThe next morning the professor simply denied it. He said, “What nonsense are you talking? I am perfectly okay.”\nI had told his gardener, “When he comes into the garden, you simply say, ‘My God! What has happened to you? You cannot walk, you are wobbling. Something is wrong with you. Just go inside and rest and I will go and call the doctor.’”\nAnd I had said to both these people, “Whatsoever he says, exactly in his own words, you write it\ndown. I will collect those notes.”\nTo the gardener he said, “Yes, it seems something is wrong. Perhaps I should rest, I should not go to the university. But I don’t see any need to call the doctor.” He was perfectly healthy and there was no problem, so finally he decided that at least for half an hour or an hour he would go to the university.\nOn the way I had said to many people whom I trusted On the way there was the postmaster. I told\nhim, “Even if you are busy, don’t miss: when the professor passes by you shout at him, ‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Are you mad? Your body is absolutely sick! You come into my house, rest. I will call the doctor.’” I collected all these notes. The professor said, “Yes, since last night I have this feeling that something is going wrong. I am not exactly sure what is going wrong, but something is wrong. I feel a certain trembling inside, a fear, as if I am not going to last long.”\nHis house and the university philosophy department were almost one mile apart, and he had always walked – but that day, in the middle, he stopped another professor’s car and told him, “I don’t think I will be able to reach the university department.”\nThe university was on a hilly place, up and down. From his house it was an uphill task to reach the department; the department was on the top of the hill and his house was in the valley.\nHe said, “I am huffing, huffingmy body is trembling. I think there is fever, and there is much more\nwhich I cannot figure out.” So he wanted a lift.\nAnd the professor who had passed him was sent by me: “Just when he is in a very bad situation, you stop your car and ask, ‘What is the matter?’” In the car he said, “You should not have come, you should have called the doctor. Your eyes look as if they have lost all luster. Your face looks dry, faded; you look like a faded painting. Just in one night! Had you a heart attack in the night? It must have been serious.”\nAnd he said, “It seems that I had a heart attack and I was not aware because I was asleep, but now I\nknow. All the symptoms are showing that my life is at the very end.”\nWhen he entered the university department, the peon who used to sit in front of the department I\nhad told him, “When he comes, you simply jump and hold him.”\nHe said, “But he will be very angry. And what kind of thing are you asking? You have never asked anything before.”\nI said, “We are doing an experiment – me and the professor. Don’t interfere, you simply do what I say. You just hold him and tell him, ‘You are going to fall.’” He did that and the professor thanked him. And the peon had no need to tell him that he was going to fall; the professor said himself, “If you had not been here I would have fallen.”\nInside the department I was waiting for him. I said, “Jesus! You look like a ghost! What calamity has happened to you?” I took hold of him, put him in a reclining chair.\nAnd he said, “Just one thing I want to tell you. My children are small” – he had only two children – “my wife is young, inexperienced. I don’t have any family; my father is dead, my mother is dead. I don’t know anybody who can take care of them when I am gone. I can think only of you.”\nI said, “You don’t be worried. I will take care of your children, your wife – better than you are doing.\nBut before you decide to leave the world, I have to show you a few notes.” He said, “A fewwhat notes?”\nI said, “I will have to go and collect them.” He said, “From whom?”\nI said “From your wife, from the gardener, from the postmaster, from the professor who drove you\nhere, from the peon who saved you from falling.” He said, “But how do you know?”\nI said, “It was all planned. And you say that man cannot be deceived by something nonexistential?”\nI went down, collected all the notes, and I showed him them one by one. And I said, “Look how you are getting caught up. To your wife you absolutely denied there was anything wrong. To the gardener you said ‘Perhaps something is wrong.’ But it was”perhaps,” you were not certain yet. But the idea was getting in. To the postmaster you said, ‘Yes, something must have happened. From the very evening I was feeling bad, sick, apprehensive.’\n“With the professor in the car you accepted that you must have had a heart attack while you were asleep. You were feeling so weak” – and he was a strong man – “that you could not conceive yourself walking uphill to the department. And to the peon who jumped and took hold of you, you said, ‘I am grateful to you. I was just going to fail, to collapse.’ Now this is a simple idea,” I told him, “that has been implanted in you.”\nNow do you see the point? This man can even die, you just have to keep on going. I was only proving a point on which he was not agreeing, so this was only an argument – I did not want him to\ndie. Otherwise, I would have talked to the doctor and had him say to him, “Your days are finished, so whatever you want to do – write your will or anything – do it quickly. It is not something that I can help with, your heart is simply finished; any moment it is going to stop.” I could have killed that man just by an idea.\nSeeing the notes, immediately he was back, perfectly healthy. He walked down the hill laughing, and told the peon, “You should not listen to this man, he is dangerous. He almost killed me!” He told the other professor, “This is not right, that you suggested to me that I must have had a heart attack.” He told the postmaster, “You are my neighbor, and is this right, to push me towards death?”\nHe was very angry with his wife. He said, “I can think that he persuaded other people – he has everybody impressed by him – but I cannot believe that my own wife deceived me, listened to him. We were in an argument; it was a question of my prestige, and you destroyed it!” But the wife said, “You should be grateful to him. He has given proof that man can be programmed for something which does not exist at all.”\nYou think you are a Christian? It is just an idea implanted in you. Do you think there is a God? An idea implanted in you. Do you think there is a heaven and hell? It is nothing but programming. You are all programmed.\nMy work with you is to deprogram you. And I am showing you all the notes – day after day, continuously – that these are the things that have made you almost dull, stupid, even attracted towards suicide, towards death. My religion is unique in this way: all the religions of the past have programmed people; I deprogram you, and then I leave you alone, to yourself.\nPeople have been asking me, “What is your religion? What is your philosophy? Can’t you give us something like a Christian catechism so we can understand that these are your principles?”\nI have none, because that will be programming you again. When a Hindu becomes a Christian, what happens? The Christians deprogram him as a Hindu, and reprogram him as a Christian. There is no difference. From one ditch he has fallen into another ditch. Perhaps the newness of it may keep him happy for a few days, but soon he will start looking for another ditch. Now he is addicted to ditches! And in this way he is simply digging his own grave. That is the final ditch into which he will fall.\nI deprogram you, and I don’t give you any other program. I leave you alone, empty, just a zero. In\nthat zero, the ego disappears and all the blessings start showering on you. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSOMETIMES DURING DISCOURSE MY VISION BECOMES UNFOCUSED. I SEE YOU CHANGE: WITH OTHER FACES, OTHER CLOTHES, AND OTHER BODILY GESTURES. IT’S A STRANGE FEELING. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?\nIt is nothing. It is not a strange phenomenon, it is just the Oregonian sun and its heat.\nYou should simply go to Pythagoras – you need medical treatment. And of course, I am not a medicine man. First, get medical treatment, and when you start seeing me the way everybody else is seeing me, then if you have any question I can help.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nDO YOU SEE EXPERIMENTS ON HUMAN LIFE, SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL BIRTH AND THE EXCHANGE OF HEARTS AND BRAINS, AS AN ADVANCE, OR AS AN ACTION AGAINST NATURE?\nIt all depends who is going to do it. If the politicians are going to do it, or the so-called religions are going to do it, then it is against nature. They cannot do anything natural, they are against nature. But if it is being done by an international academy of scientists – I say International academy of scientists – it can be a tremendous, progressive step, and it will not be against nature. It will be nature’s growth.\nBut it all depends on who is doing it. The experiments themselves are neutral. No experiment has any vested interest, it is neutral. You can use poison to kill you; the same poison can be used by medical people to save you. It all depends who is doing it.\nFor example, the discovery of atomic energy was a step of tremendously great progress, a quantum leap. We had found a key to transform the earth into paradise – so much energy in such a small atom. And they are in everything... just in a dewdrop there are millions of atoms. Any atom, if it is exploded, releases so much energy that you can make the whole earth live in luxury. Or you can create Hiroshima and Nagasaki – thousands of people dead within seconds.\nBut because atomic energy, after its invention, went into the hands of the politicians, it became a servant of death. Now there are even more advanced nuclear weapons which can destroy the whole earth. The already existing weapons are enough to destroy this earth seven times. One simply wonders why nations are going to develop more and more nuclear power. Seven times destroying the earth is not enough? In fact, you can destroy the earth only once.\nBut scientific progress falls into the hands of the politicians because only they can provide enough finance to make these discoveries possible. The scientists of the whole world should think it over: their genius is being used by idiots! The scientists should disconnect themselves from any nation – whether it is the Soviet Union or America. They should create an international academy of sciences. And it is not difficult. If all the scientists of the world are together, finances can be made available, and these discoveries can help man tremendously.\nThe international academy of scientists can be in this international city. We can give them land, and every possible support. But they should be the decisive factors in what is going to happen through their experiments. And it is time the scientists should recognize their great responsibility. If a third world war happens then the scientists will be the greatest criminals, because they supplied all kinds of inventions to the politicians.\nScience should not be the monopoly of any nation, any country. The whole idea is stupid. How can science be monopolized? And every country is trying to monopolize the scientists, keep their inventions secret. This is against humanity, against nature, against existence. Whatever a genius discovers should be in the service of the whole.\nYou are asking whether discoveries like changing human hearts or human brains are progressive steps. They are of great importance to bring a new humanity on the earth. If Einstein’s body is no longer capable of living, do you think it would not be good if his whole brain is transplanted into a young, healthy man? The new man will become an Einstein, because all the genius of Einstein is transplanted to a younger body.\nThis way bodies may go on changing, but we can keep the genius of Albert Einstein growing for centuries. And if a man in a seventy-year life can give so much, you can imagine if his brain continues for centuries how much benefit it will be for humanity, for the whole universe.\nThis is really a wastage: the container gets rotten, and you throw the content also. The body is only a container. If the container has become dirty, old, unusable, change the container, but don’t throw away the content. The genius mind can live for eternity in different bodies; that is nothing against nature.\nYou heart, if it starts failing, and if you are of immense value to humanity... what is the fear of exchanging the heart? Somebody may be dying from cancer, but his heart is perfectly healthy; that heart can be planted in a man who is talented, a genius, and is healthy, but whose heart is not strong. This is simple; there is nothing in it against nature.\nBut with politicians and the power in their hands, of course every advance has gone against nature. Everything that human genius has discovered, invented, finally is in the service of death. So are the priests. Now science is no longer a child, that it has to depend on others. Science is now grown-up enough, it is adult. Just a little courage.…\nI give the invitation to all the scientists of the world; we have the place, we have intelligent people here to help you in every possible way. And if you want to make an international academy here, we are capable of managing finances for you.\nIt will be a great revolution in the history of man. The whole power will be in the hands of the scientists, who have never done any harm to anybody. And once all the power is in the hands of the scientists, politicians will fade away of their own accord. They have been exploiting scientists for their own purposes, and to be exploited by anybody is not an act of dignity.\nThe scientists should recognize their dignity, they should recognize their individuality. They should recognize that they have been exploited down the ages by the priests and the politicians. Now it is time to declare that science is going to stand on its own feet. This will be a great freedom.\nThen all these experiments, such as laboratory babies, will be of a different caliber, because you can arrange what kind of genius you want. Up to now it has been just accidental, and because it has been accidental, ninety-nine percent of the people have nothing to contribute. They contribute only problems to the world.\nNow, what has Ethiopia contributed to the world? What have the poor countries contributed to the world – or even the rich countries? Except problems, wars, there is no contribution on their part.\nBut if you can give birth to a child in a scientific lab It is possible, there is no problem in it. The male\nsemen and the woman’s egg can meet in a tube. There is no need to go on in the old bullock cart way. We can look and we can have the whole picture of what this child is going to be. If we want more poets, we can create more poets. If we want more musicians, we can create more musicians. And we can create only geniuses; there is no need for mediocre people – they have had their day.\nWe can give the child strength, long life. We can make sure that he never becomes sick, that he will never becomes old. It is just a question of managing and finding the right egg and the right male contribution to the egg. What we have been doing is just utterly unintelligent.\nAnd this will free man also from guilt, possessiveness, jealousy, because you will not be producing children. Sex, for the first time, will be simply fun! Children will be produced in the lab. They will belong to all. And because you are not going to produce children in the old way – it should be illegal and criminal to do so, you will be behind bars if you do it – then many problems of your life will be simply dissolved.\nWhy is the man so insistent ? Throughout the ages the insistence has remained there: he wants to\nbe certain that the child born out of his wife’s womb is his. Why? Who are you anyway? It is a question of property, because your child will become the inheritor of all that you have accumulated. You want to be certain that it is your child, not your neighbor’s child.\nWomen have been kept almost imprisoned, for the simple fear that if they start mixing with people it will be difficult to decide whose child it is. Only the mother will know, or even she may not know.\nOnce production of life goes into the hands of science, sex will be transformed. Then you are not jealous, then you are not a monopolist, then monogamy is absurd. Then sex is just fun, the way you enjoy tennis. And you don’t bother that the partners should remain monogamous – two bodies enjoying each other.… And there will be no fear that the wife may get pregnant and there will be problems, financial and other.\nSex will no longer be a problem for the world population; it will no longer be a problem for the priest. In fact, if children are produced in the scientific lab, many of the troubles of the world will dissolve. And we can create the best people: beautiful, healthy, capable of living as long as we want. Old age is not necessary – a man can remain young, healthy, without sickness.\nAll these hospitals and so many people, so much money involved Do you know? America spends\nmore money on laxatives than on education. Great idea! Who cares about education? The question is laxatives!\nBut the basic thing should be remembered. Scientists have to be courageous enough and declare that they don’t belong to any nation, to any religion, that whatsoever they will be doing will be for the whole humanity. And I don’t see that there is anything impossible in it.\nI am absolutely for those progressive inventions which can make man happier, live longer, be younger, healthier, and which make his life more of a play, fun, and less of a torturous journey from the cradle to the grave.\nCHAPTER 20\nOnly an egoist can be humble\n18 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIF YOU ARE ONLY A FALLIBLE, ORDINARY MAN, AND NOT A GREAT MASTER, WHY ARE WE CALLED “THE CHOSEN FEW” WHO ARE GOING TO BE MESSENGERS OF RAJNEESHISM FOR THE WORLD AT LARGE? DOESN’T THIS FULFILL OUR EGOS?\nI have no ifs and buts in my philosophy of life. It is not a question of “if.” I am not a great master but\nan ordinary, fallible man – it is the truth.\nAnd to be chosen by an ordinary fallible man – I cannot conceive how it can fulfill your ego. If you were chosen by a great master, then certainly your egos would be fulfilled. But in your being chosen by an ordinary, fallible man, your egos will be completely destroyed. The fallible man will most probably choose the wrong person. The ordinary man is bound to choose ordinary people. It is impossible for you to feel extraordinary.\nI want you to realize a simple thing: in existence there is nothing higher, nothing lower. There are no separate entities to be compared – it is one existence. And to be part of it you cannot remain extraordinary. You are dividing yourself from the beautiful ordinariness of existence.\nThe people who have called themselves the great masters, prophets, messiahs, are simply egoistic. Naturally, these people attracted other egoistic people.\nJesus declares he is the only begotten son of God. He chooses his twelve apostles – all idiots, but their egos are tremendously fulfilled. Chosen by the only begotten son of God, they become extraordinary in their minds. The moment Jesus was departing, the last night, do you know what the disciples were asking him? They were not concerned that tomorrow he is going to be crucified, they did not ask a single question about that. They did not ask, “What can we do to prevent it?” Not a single one of them said, “I am ready to be crucified in your place.”\nWhat they asked is simply disgusting. They asked, “Lord, when you reach paradise, of course you will be sitting at the right hand of God the father. Please tell us, what will be our positions? Who will be next to you?”\nDo you think these people are sane, sensible, reasonable? These people are madly egoistic. They are with Jesus not because they love him but because they are going to use Jesus as a ladder to reach paradise, to the highest possible post there. Of course, they allow Jesus to be at the right hand of God, but who will be next to him? – and then? – all twelve apostles.… I do not see any love, any gratitude.\nThey have not come for that. They were attracted by Jesus’ proclamation that he is the messenger, the prophet, the son. And a fisherman is asking, “What will be my place in paradise?” A fisherman has no place in this world. He is trying to console himself; he is trying to believe that Jesus is the son of God, because on that belief depends his ego. Without Jesus being the only begotten son of God, he is only a fisherman. But if Jesus is the son of God, and the fisherman is by his side, naturally he becomes extraordinary, the most superior person possible. He has bypassed all the rabbis, all the saints, all the prophets, all the priests. This is the inner functioning of their mind.\nYou can be with me only if you don’t have such idiotic ideas about yourself. To me, being a fisherman is far better than being a stupid apostle. And who cares about God? He is not even a fisherman, he is not even a carpenter – who cares to be on his right side or left side? In the first place he does not exist, so there is no left, no right.\nYou can be with me for a simple reason only.\nThey were doing business. They were all Jews, and it was a good bargain. Just to hang around this crazy man and then to gain all the glories of heaven – it was a good bargain!\nWith me, you have only to lose; you cannot gain anything. You are in a game where you can only be a loser. You will have to lose your ego, you will have to lose your jealousy, you will have to lose your fear. You will have to lose all kinds of crap that you are filled with. You will have to be empty – and emptiness cannot claim the ego. There is no place in emptiness, in nothingness, for the ego. You can be with me, not for anything that is going to be profitable in the future; you can be here only for this moment.\nI do not promise you anything. All your prophets and messiahs and avataras have been lying – because all their promises are simple lies and nothing else. They have been befooling you, cheating you, exploiting you, knowing your weakness. This is your weakness: the ego. Anybody can exploit you, he just has to make your ego a little bigger.\nIn India, we have a proverb, “In time of need one has to call a donkey ‘Daddy.’” Knowing perfectly well that he is a donkey, in time of need you have to call him Daddy. Of course the donkey feels great. It is a mutual phenomenon: you are calling him Daddy for your profit, and he is readily available because nobody has ever called him Daddy. Everybody has been, up to now, calling him donkey.\nI was expelled from one of my colleges. I have been expelled many times, but this time it was very difficult for me to get into another college. The city I was living in had almost twenty colleges, but now everybody was aware that it was better not to let me in, because I made expulsion difficult, almost impossible. And the trouble was that I was always right! All their expulsions were absolutely wrong, and they accepted it.\nThe principles told me, “We are sorry, and we know that you are right, but what can we do? It is difficult, we are in a great fix.” Once, a professor who had been in the college for thirty years, one of the most important professors of the college, known all over India, had written a letter: “Either this student should not remain in the college, or accept my resignation. We both cannot be in the college together.”\nThe principal told me, “I know, I understand your argument. It is absolutely valid” – because the professor was teaching logic and not allowing me to argue!\n“What kind of professor is he?” I asked him. “Particularly in the subject of logic, argumentation is absolutely appropriate. He is not teaching me love, he is teaching me logic. And if I find loopholes in his logic, what is wrong in it? He should correct himself.”\nThe principal said, “I understand. He is behaving arrogantly, knowing that we cannot lose him. He is one of our best, most well-known professors; he attracts students to the college. He knows that I can be blackmailed, and he is blackmailing me; but I am sorry, I have to expel you.”\nNo college was ready to accept me because the same was going to happen everywhere; it had happened in a few other colleges before. But I have my own way of doing things. I went to one principal who was thought to be a crackpot. And why was he thought to be a crackpot? Because in the early morning from five to seven he was praying to the mother goddess Kali. He himself was a big man, black, ugly, and he was a devotee of the mother Kali – kali means black. And the pictures or the statues of mother Kali are really unbelievable. Who is going to worship this woman?\nShe has in one of her hands a freshly-cut head of a man, blood dripping, and in another hand, a sword ready for anybody she comes across. And she is dancing on the chest of her husband! Twelve skulls of human beings make her garland. She is ferocious, blood-thirsty. She seems to be more representative of death than life.\nHe was a devotee of the goddess Kali and he got almost in a frenzy When he prayed, he would\npray so loudly – and his voice was not musical. The whole neighborhood was tortured. Nobody could sleep in the morning when it is so beautiful to turn over and go to sleep again. You would go on tossing and turning, and he would shout his prayers and dance.\nI reached his home – I did not go to the college, to his office – I reached his home at four o’clock early in the morning. He was just coming out of his bathroom. He said, “Why have you come here?”\nI said, “I wanted to meet you in your temple, not in that ordinary principal’s office. Here you are your reality. There you are nothing but a principal. There are millions of principals in the country, but there is not a single other devotee of your caliber. I wanted to meet you and see you at your best.”\nHe smiled, he put his hand on my hand. He said, “You are the first person to recognize me. Nobody recognizes what I am doing. All the neighbors are against me, all the professors are against me, all the students are against me.”\nI said, “It will be a great privilege for me if I can sit and just watch your devotion, your dance, your musical singing.” And that day he did his best! After he was finished, I told him, “You have converted me: I have become a devotee of the mother goddess Kali. Now I will see you in the office.”\nHe said, “There is no need. I know you have been expelled – and a person like you with such great insight! You need not bother; you are admitted to the college. You need not apply for it. You are my most respected student.”\nAnd he kept his word: he permitted me in his college, he gave me a scholarship. And whenever there was any occasion – and he used to find occasions to torture the professors and the students by his long, boring speeches – he would always mention me. He would say, “Perhaps nobody else is understanding me, but I am certain that there is one person” – and I was always sitting in front – “who understands me, and that is enough.”\nYou cannot be close to me when I say I am an ordinary man. And it is not “if.” Don’t try to deceive yourself, baby. I am really an ordinary man. Unless you are also ordinary, there is no possibility of communion between me and you. If you are extraordinary you will be so high, above the roof of the Mandir. If you are also simple and ordinary, you will understand the beauty, the grace, the innocence of it. Your ego will disappear.\nBut because of your “if” the whole problem has arisen in your mind. Deep down you want to believe that I am extraordinary. You may be arguing within yourself that I am just being humble in saying that I am ordinary. I am not a humble man. Only an egoist can be humble. Humbleness is just the ego standing on its head. I don’t have any ego – how can I be humble? There is no way.\nYou must be arguing within yourself that this is my way of teaching you humility, simplicity, egolessness, but I am not ordinary. Please, don’t deceive yourself. I am just as ordinary as you are, with all the weaknesses, with all the frailties. This is to be emphasized continuously because you will tend to forget it. And why am I emphasizing it? So that you can see a very significant point: if an ordinary man – who is just like you – can be enlightened, then there is no problem for you either. You can also be enlightened.\nAll the religions of the world have created a totally different situation. Krishna, the Hindu god, is an incarnation of God himself. You can listen to him, you can appreciate him, you can worship him, but you cannot imagine that you can become another Krishna! He is not an ordinary mortal, he comes from on high – you cannot even imagine the height from where he comes. You are ordinary creatures of the earth. He has come to give you a message, he has come to save you; he is your savior.\nYou know yourself perfectly well – how can you imagine yourself a savior? You know your weaknesses – you cannot drop smoking, how can you be a savior?\nIf you want me to prove my ordinariness.… There are a few difficulties; otherwise I would start smoking. It is just that I am allergic. That means you are in a far better position than me. I cannot smoke, I will immediately start coughing and will have an asthma attack. You are in a far better position. I can start doing everything that you do – I am just lazy. You have to tolerate me. But my point has to be understood completely, without any ifs and buts.\nI belong to you. I am part of you.\nMy place is amidst you.\nThat will destroy your egoistic trips and numbers. It will give you a great rejoicing that one need not be an incarnation of God to be enlightened; one need not be a special messenger of God, like Mohammed, to be enlightened. One need not be in direct communication, with a private line to God, and still you can be enlightened.\nThe ego is the barrier. I am exposing my whole heart to you. I was not born out of a virgin mother, I was born just as you were born. I was not born while my mother was standing, she was lying down just as your mother was lying down.\nWhen Buddha was born, his mother was standing, and he dropped onto the earth, standing. I have never done anything like that. Not only did he drop from the womb standing, he walked seven feet, seven steps – symbolic, esoteric. The number seven is very esoteric. And on his last step, he stood there – just born, standing, walking – he stood there and declared to the whole universe, “I am the most supreme enlightened being!”\nNow, I have not done anything like that. Even if I had been told to do it, I would have refused. It looks so foolish. Now, how can you imagine yourself walking side by side with Buddha? Impossible, he is superhuman – you are an ordinary creature.\nMohammed died, but in a special way. He is no ordinary man, he is the last prophet of God. After him there is not going to be any prophet. He closed the door because he has given the final message. Now there are going to be no further additions, impressions, no editing, nothing has to be added. He has given the essential and basic and the most profound, final message to the world. He cannot die in an ordinary way.\nWhen he died, he flew with his horse upwards. People saw him going beyond the clouds, and then he disappeared. Even the horse went with him. It was no ordinary horse, it was Prophet Hazrat Mohammed’s horse. You cannot even compare yourself with Mohammed’s horse – you are just a donkey!\nThese people were pure egoists, creating stories about themselves, and then their followers went on and on creating more and more stories to make their prophet higher than other prophets. Over\nthe centuries, so many extraordinary miracles have accumulated around these prophets – that impresses people. Becoming a Catholic, you become special.\nBut to be with me you have to become ordinary, you have to come down to the earth. You have to be human. And the moment you understand humanity, its frailty, its weaknesses, you will understand other human beings more clearly. You will not be so unkind if somebody commits a mistake; you know it is human. If somebody goes wrong, you will not be too hard. You will say, “So what? I am also prone to go that way.” If somebody drinks alcohol, smokes cigars, plays cards.…\nProphets are not allowed to do such things. Prophets are not allowed to do natural things even. Mahavira, the Jaina prophet, is not allowed to perspire. I am very much worried about the man, because perspiration is a natural device to keep your temperature exactly the same, normal. If perspiration stops, Mahavira will explode into flames; his temperature will go higher and higher.\nPerspiration is a natural way to keep the heat from entering you. You perspire, and the sunrays are prevented by your perspiration. The sunrays become engaged – they are foolish – they become engaged in evaporating the perspiration. They forget you, they leave you alone, and your temperature remains the same.\nYou have holes all over your body: seven million small holes, with glands ready to perspire any moment. If Mahavira never perspired, I can think only of one thing – that we should forget the idea that we have invented plastic. Mahavira’s body must have been a plastic body; only a plastic body cannot perspire.\nPlastic is very stubborn. Now the scientists of the whole world are worried: so much plastic is being thrown into the ocean, into the rivers, into the earth, and there is no way for plastic to dissolve into earth or into water. It is accumulating there because it is not a natural product.\nIf a tree falls down, soon it will disappear into its basic elements: the water will move into the water, the earth will move into the earth, the air will be released into the air, and the tree will disappear. But plastic is not going to disappear; it is going to remain there, preventing natural cycles of rejuvenation. And each year there is more and more plastic, because it is cheap. You need not keep it: you use the content and throw the container; it has no value.\nMahavira’s body does not perspire. What about other things? He does not urinate... because a man who does not perspire, do you think he will urinate? What happens to the water that he drinks? His bladder must be getting bigger and bigger and bigger – at bursting point. Any moment he can create a flood! He does not defecate. Now, he must be unique, the only person in the whole history – past, present, future – at the top of the line of those who are constipated. You cannot defeat him.\nOne man has tried. The greatest length known to humanity is... one man in England – of course, it has to be in England – remained constipated for eight months. This is the longest period. Only an Englishman can manage that. But what about Mahavira? – for eighty-two years!\nAll this nonsense, all these lies are invented for a simple reason: to humiliate you, to make you feel unworthy, to make you feel guilty, to create an inferiority complex in you. And if an inferiority complex is created in you, you start going towards something which is superior. You want to become the\npresident of the country, you want to have all the wealth of the world, you want in every direction and dimension to be something special and higher. From inferiority to superiority is the journey of the ego.\nI want you to understand that you are perfectly okay as you are. Just relax in your simple ordinariness. Don’t try to change it. Don’t try any discipline to improve yourself. Just relax and accept.\nIf the sun accepts you.… Do you think presidents get more suntan than you? Do you think trees look greener to the presidents than to you? Do you think the world is in any way different to the kings and the queens than to you? If this existence accepts you, then who is the priest to condemn you? He is against nature, against existence. And because of his continuous condemnation of your ordinariness, he goes on destroying you.\nI respect you, not because you don’t perspire. I respect you, not because you were born of a virgin girl. I respect you, not because you were born standing, walked seven steps and declared, “I am the most enlightened man ever!” I respect you because you are simple, ordinary, vulnerable, fallible.\nIf existence is ready to accept you, who I am not to accept you? All the religions have been rejecting you. And it is a strange phenomenon: they go on condemning you, rejecting you, humiliating you – and you go on falling at their feet, worshipping them.\nYou need not worship me, you need not fall at my feet. You need not in any way think of yourself as my followers. You are my fellow travelers.\nAs long as it suits you to be with me, be with me. The moment you feel it is time to depart on some crossroad, then go to Santa Fe. I have nothing against Santa Fe. Santa Fe is my commune – just a few camels have gathered there.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWOULD YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GACHCHHAMIS? HOW CAN WE KEEP THEM FRESH AND ALIVE AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING LIKE THE MEANINGLESS, STEREOTYPED RITUALS PRACTICED IN OTHER RELIGIONS?\nIt depends on you, not on the gachchhamis. If you are alive, if you are full of love, if you are as curious as a child – wondering about everything in life – if you are alive, flowing, then whatever you do will remain alive. You are trying to throw the responsibility on the gachchhamis.\nPlease remember: everything, if you do it as a duty, will be dead. Everything, if you do it out of love, will be alive – you are pouring yourself into it.\nWhen you wake up in the morning do you say, “Shit! Again?” Then your day is going to be what you want: it is going to be shit. But if you wake up in the morning, just the way a child opens his eyes for the first time, looks all around: such an immensely beautiful world – so many colors, so many birds\nsinging, the sun and the moon and the stars... and the people, each individual and unique. The child makes everything alive.\nSee a child trying to catch a butterfly – those colors of the butterfly, the beauty of it! He is running. Most probably he will not be able to catch it, because butterflies are clever enough. They will sit and create the desire in the child, that now is the moment; and as he reaches close by, again they are on the wing. But the child is enchanted with flowers, with seashells, with anything! Colored stones on the beach.…\nIn my childhood, my mother had to take all kinds of things from my pockets. Now I have no pockets, then I used to have four: two on the side, two in the front – and long pockets. I harassed the tailor, “The pockets have to be as long as possible.”\nHe said, “But that looks odd. And your father says something else to me, ‘Don’t listen to him.’ And it\nis not beautiful to have that long a pocket, four pockets. And what do you do with those pockets?”\nI said, “There are so many things to collect in the world – beautiful stones by the riverside. It is so\nchallenging.”\nMy mother had to empty my pockets before I went to sleep, because otherwise all those stones would be on the bed and I would not be able to sleep. But she had to keep them, because in the morning the first thing I would ask was, “Where have all those stones gone?” I had piles of stones, seashells; and collecting all these things I was more happy than King Midas must have been.\nMidas had the blessing of gods. He had been praying for it; so remember always, sometimes prayers just by accident come true. He was praying that the power should be given to him that whatever he touches becomes gold. And then he was caught. He was the most miserable man the world has known.\nHe would touch his food and it would become gold. Even his own children would not come close to him, because he had touched one of his boys; he was standing there – a golden statue of course, but dead. The people of his court escaped. His own wife was not ready to sleep with him – not even in the same room, because who knows? In sleep he may touch you, and you are finished!\nThat man was deserted by everybody, and he was surrounded with nothing but gold. His palace was gold, his streets were gold, the trees of his garden were gold. It was all gold, and Midas was the most poor man in the world. Not a single friend; even his own wife and children finally escaped. He died in utter misery and starvation, because water he could not drink, food he could not eat. Whatever he touched immediately became gold. He had to carry the great weight of his clothes – because they all became gold. Now he understood what he had asked for. This was a golden poverty, golden death. But it was not alive.\nRemember that: it depends on you, it is your touch that keeps things alive or dead.\nThe gachchhamis have to be understood. The first thing: they are not prayers, because there is no God to whom you can pray. The gachchhamis are your decision. And because you are so asleep, you have to go on reminding yourself.\nThe first is, buddham sharanam gachchhami: I go to the feet of the awakened one. It does not say, “I\ngo to the feet of Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Gautam Buddha” – no.\nBuddham is not Gautam Buddha. Gautam Buddha’s original name was Gautam Siddharth. When he became awakened, then Siddharth was dropped and the world has know him since then as Gautam Buddha. “Buddha” is nobody’s property. It simply means the sleep is over, you are no longer dreaming, no longer hallucinating; you are simply awake.\nReminding yourself, “I go to the feet of the awakened one,” is not worshipping, because the awakened one is not any person in particular. There are no feet of the awakened one. It simply says, and reminds you, that you are surrendered to the fact of awakening, that this is your decision, this is your commitment.\nThe second line of the gachchhamis is, sangham sharanam gachchhami: I go to the feet of the commune of the awakened one. Why? Because the awakened one is no longer an individual. He becomes spread over all those people who love him.\nMy commune is me. So anybody who tries to divide – he loves me but he does not love my commune – has not understood it at all. And he does not love me – he is befooling himself. If he loves me, then it is natural that he will love those who love me. The commune is all those people who are seeking and searching to be awakened. At least one decision they have made, that they love the awakened one and they would like to have the same quality to their consciousness. Howsoever long the journey may be, they are determined to reach the goal.\nIn the commune there will be all kinds of people: a few will be camels, a few will be lions, a few may have become children. It is a good hit for your ego. To go to the feet of the awakened one may again create from the back door the same ego. But to go to the feet of the commune, where there are camels Sometimes you will touch the feet of the camel. Sometimes the lion will roar at you when\nyou are trying to touch his feet; he may make a breakfast of you. And the child.…\nNo culture, no society, no religion, has respected the child. Every culture is trying to make the child behave in the ways of the old people because they know what is right; how can a child know what is right? A child has to be trained, nurtured. He is thought by all the civilizations of the world to be a savage, a primitive. He has to be cultured, he has to be made civilized. They are all cutting and pruning the child and trying to make him a good citizen.\nThe old man has been respected by all the cultures, all the religions, all the societies. Why? Just because he has lived seventy years, eighty years, ninety years? All old people become cunning. Naturally their experience of life makes them cunning. The more cunning you are, the more successful you will be. They all become suspicious, mistrusting, because the more you trust, the more you will be exploited. You have to continually go on mistrusting everybody, so nobody can manage to exploit you.\nThe old man has learned that life is a struggle, a struggle to survive. It is a continuous war against the whole world. Everybody is at your neck – before he cuts your neck, you have to cut his. There is no time, you cannot wait; you have to be the first to cut, to destroy the other. And this old man has been respected by everybody.\nI am telling you, respect the child, because the child is innocent, trusting, loving, enjoying the small things of life. He has no desire to rise higher on any ladder of success. He is utterly contented – you have not yet poisoned him. Your educational system has not yet put his mind on the way of ambition. The child has no ambition. And the awakened one regains his childhood.\nThe awakened one comes back to a greater childhood, to a greater innocence. The child’s innocence was not his achievement, he was simply ignorant of the ways of the world; but the awakened one has passed through the whole life’s experience, the whole expanse of good, bad – and still, by becoming awake, he has dropped it.\nThe child was going to be corrupted sooner or later. The awakened one cannot be corrupted. The child’s innocence was really ignorance. The awakened one’s innocence is not ignorance, it is his wisdom. But it is a circle, complete. As a child he started, moved around the world and its experiences – miseries, sufferings, anxieties, anguishes – and has come back to the same point again. The circle is complete, he has become a child again.\nSo in the commune there will be many camels – the new arrivals are bound to be camels, some old stubborn guys are going to be camels. There will be lions who have dropped their camelhood. And there will be a few children – innocent.\nTo go to the feet of the commune simply means to destroy your ego completely. It is so easy to go to the feet of the awakened one; it is more difficult to go to the feet of the commune. More difficult, because your ego will hurt; but more important, because that ego has to be destroyed.\nAnd the third gachchhami sutra is: I go to the feet of the ultimate law of the awakened one.\nThe ultimate law is just to be silent, utterly at ease, without any condemnation of any part of your being – a total acceptance.\nI have been asked hundreds of timesOne day a woman came and said, “You have given sannyas\nto my husband. Do you know that he is a drunkard? Have you told him to stop drinking?” I said, “Why should I tell him to stop drinking?”\nShe said, “But what kind of a sannyasin is he?”\nI said, “Anybody who comes to me is bound to have weaknesses, frailties. I have no condemnation. You think your husband has not told this to me? This was the first thing. With tears he has told me, ‘Please let me tell you that I am a drunkard. I have tried my hardest to stop drinking before I came to you for sannyas, but it is impossible. In this life it is not possible for me to stop drinking.’”\nSo I said, “Let me take a chance. If you refuse, it is perfectly okay.”\nHe said, “But if you give me sannyas knowing perfectly well that I am a drunkard, thenYou know\nbetter.”\nI said to the woman, “Your husband has exposed himself – that is simplicity. He was not hiding anything. And there is nothing to be worried about. Sannyas is the beginning of transformation. It\ndoes not ask you All the religions have asked you first to fulfill certain conditions and then you\ncan be a sannyasin.\n“I am a totally different kind of man. My approach is utterly different. I say become a sannyasin without any conditions and sannyas will transform you slowly, slowly, and will bring into existence all those qualities that other religions were asking before sannyas. Before sannyas, those qualities are not possible.\n“If I say to this man, ‘First you stop drinking alcohol completely, only then can I give you sannyas,’ he will not be able to . He has tried his whole life – and the more you fail again and again, the more you know that it is completely useless to try. You know you are going to fail. I don’t make any conditions.\n“I have given sannyas to your husband. Don’t be worried, because my sannyas is not renouncing the wife or the children or the house or the business of the world. I am bringing a totally new conception of sannyas into the world.\nThis request for sannyas is only the decision of a sleeping man. Perhaps in a moment when the sleep is not so thick, and he is just on the borderline from where he can be awakened You know in\nsleep sometimes you are fast asleep, in a deep sleep; and sometimes the sleep is thin – you can even hear voices, people talking, vehicles moving on the road. You are still asleep, but very superficially. In these superficial moments of sleep a person hears about sannyas, and the alchemy of it, and the transformation that is possible through it.\n“I give sannyas without any conditions. This is enough, that the man has asked to become a sannyasin. He is far better than those who don’t drink, than those who don’t smoke, than those who don’t gamble. He is far more courageous, and far more simple.”\nAfter a few days the man came and said, “You have created a trouble for me” – because in India if people see a sannyasin they simply fall at his feet. A sannyasin passing by, you have to touch his feet. He has done something that you also desire to do but are not strong enough to do – he has done it. But those people were not aware that he is my sannyasin. And I had chosen the red color particularly for that purpose, because in India that has been for centuries the color of the sannyasin.\nThe drunkard said, “I am now really in a difficulty – people touching my feet, and I am a drunkard, a third-rate man! Now I have to do something. This is just too heavy for me, that a brahmin is touching my feet! And I cannot go to the pub, because in this dress if I go to the pub I tried first not to go,\nbut the temptation was too much. So one day I went there, and even the manager of the pub touched my feet. He said, ‘You have become a sannyasin? It is a miracle!’ I had gone to ask for alcohol, but I said that I had just come to see the old friends, and came back home without any drink! Now what am I to do?”\nI said, “Now it is your business. My business is finished. You asked for sannyas – I gave you\nsannyas. Now, you have to work it out.”\nHe said, “You are dangerous! You trapped me: you said there are no conditions.” I said, “There are no conditions.”\n“But,” he said, “all the conditions are coming in . Even my wife has stopped sleeping with me” – because no woman in India will sleep with a sannyasin; that is thought to be a sin. He said, “My wife used to quarrel with me continuously. Once in a while when I was too drunk and people carried me home, she had even beaten me. Now she touches my feet every morning. And I think, ‘My God! I have lost my wife. And Osho was saying you are not to renounce, but this is renunciation. I have not done anything – she has renounced me!’\n“My children had never paid any respect to me. They all were against me, they were in favor of their mother. They thought that I was destroying the whole family, their future, their education, because I was wasting the money that I earned on alcohol. Now before going to school, they all touch my feet, they ask for my blessing. And just the other day a man got married in my neighborhood and the couple came to ask for my blessings. That was too much!”\nI said, “Now, you try whatever you can” – and he did try. It became clear to him that in his whole life nobody had respected him, nobody has accepted him as a human being, nobody had thought that he was intelligent. Now it is difficult to go back. He has to go forward whatsoever the troubles, whatsoever the consequences.\nAnd he turned out to be not only a lion, but a child too. He is a poor man, but somehow he managed this festival to come here. I enquired how he managed. He sold his house, he sold his land. He arranged for some other sannyasin to give the guarantee bank balance because he had no bank balance. And there is no need for him to go back, because all that he had he has sold. His children are grown-up and he had come here with his wife. He is now old.\nHe said, “At least once more I wanted to see you, because time is fleeing fast. I am old enough – seventy-five – any day I may be gone. But I didn’t want to leave this world before I had seen you once more, so I have risked everything.”\nI was surprised because the wife was also a sannyasin; I had given sannyas only to him. I asked,\n“What happened to your wife?”\nHe said, “I have given sannyas to her.”\nThe ultimate law is to be innocent, simple, incorruptible, trusting in life and existence and just floating with the river – not fighting against the current, but going with the river wherever it is going, just being in a let-go. The moment you are in an absolute let-go, the ultimate law of life is clear to you. It is let- go, totally – no conflict with existence, a merger, a communion.\nThe gachchhamis are not a prayer; this is simply your determination. But because you are asleep, asleep in different stages – somebody asleep in the stage of the camel, somebody asleep in the stage of the lion And there are more stages in between. These three are just to make it convenient\nfor you to understand, because between the camel and the lion there will be many steps; it is a growth. Between the lion and the child there will be many steps; it is a growth. It is your whole program of sannyas.\nThe gachchhamis are a continuous reminder. But whether they will become dead, stereotyped or not, is not in my hands. It is up to you. You have to keep them alive, and the only way to keep them alive is to live, yourself, more abundantly, more intensely, more totally.\nYour intensity, your totality will give more life to the gachchhamis. Your each single remembrance of the gachchhamis will be a step forward towards the ultimate law, when you are born again, when the child in you is back. The world had taken it away, but now you have found your lost childhood. Now nobody can take it away.\nCHAPTER 21\nThe master is nothing but a sculptor\n19 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I READ YOUR BOOKS I HAVE FELT GREAT LOVE FOR YOU. NOW THAT I AM HERE I FEEL LESS LOVE. SITTING IN DISCOURSE I FEEL MORE BACK PAIN THAN LOVE. AND LATELY I’VE BEEN FEELING A LOT OF FEAR, EVEN HATRED, OF YOU. I FEEL UNSURE OF YOU, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT “MY SANNYASINS.” IT SEEMS THAT YOU EXPECT THE TOTAL YES, WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT AGAINST. I’VE SEEN MANY LOVING, AWAKE PEOPLE HERE WHO FEEL DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT HELPS ME, BUT IT WILL NOT LAST WHEN I HAVE GONE.\nI am wondering how to address you: Mr. Camel, Mrs. Camel, or Miss Camel? Perhaps the last is the best: you have been missing continuously.\nYou say when you were reading my books you loved me extremely. That is dangerous, because your love is carrying, just as a shadow to it, hatred. Extreme love is going to be followed by extreme hatred. So what is happening to you is simply natural. It shows the quality of your love: you don’t know what love is.\nIt is easy to love me reading my books, because books are dead. I am not. It is easy to love the books because you can interpret what is said in the book according to your mind. You can manage to read only that which strengthens your ego, and bypass that which destroys your ego. Books have\nnever been known to make anyone enlightened. What can books do? You are the master of the book; it is in your hands to manipulate it in any way you want.\nSo if you want to continue loving me extremely, please don’t come near me. Then I am almost dead for you; those books are far more valuable to you, they support you. You choose to hear, to read only that which is in tune with your mind – and your mind is the problem. Your mind has to be hammered. All your defenses have to be destroyed. And when you come to me you are taking a risk. If you really come to me, you will return a totally different man, with no ego, no defenses.\nAgainst whom are you creating defenses? We are one with existence. That oneness proves that there are not any real egos; all are phony. Coming close to me you will become aware that your ego is phony, that your defenses are just useless – they cannot prevent me from reaching you. And the moment I start entering you, there is great disturbance; hence you feel fear. Love disappears, fear comes in.\nMiss Camel, you missed.\nWhen there is fear, that is only a passage from love to hatred. You never fear a person you love; you cannot fear a person you love. You are absolutely open, vulnerable, without any defenses to the person you love. That’s the meaning of trust. And if your love cannot create that trust it is just something phony; you are living with an idea but not with reality.\nThe ego is not you. And to discover yourself, the ego has to be completely destroyed. That’s the\nonly way. The master is nothing but a sculptor.\nMichelangelo was asked by a shopkeeper, “In this ugly rock, a marble rock, which had been lying\nthere for almost a decade First I used to keep it in my shop, but nobody bothered about it. In fact, everybody laughed at me: ‘What can be made of this?’ Finally I threw it on the other side of the road. How did you manage to see something in this rock?”\nDo you know what Michelangelo said? He said, “Jesus called me from the rock, and asked me, ‘Please, free me from this rock. I am encaged.’ I saw Jesus clearly in the rock. Just a little hammering is needed – a few chips here, a few chips there – and Jesus can be discovered.”\nExactly that is the work of a master. You come to him as a rock, but he goes on seeing in you something which you have not even imagined. He is dashing directly towards that which is your essential reality. He has to cut off pieces of rock here and there, and bring you to your real shape.\nBooks cannot do that. You have purchased those books; you cannot purchase me. You can manage to do anything to those books you want.\nI never liked in my whole life to read a book from a library or from somebody else, for the simple reason that people go on doing nasty things to books. They will underline, they will make notes on the margin. You can do anything to a book; the book cannot say, “What are you doing to me?” A secondhand book is one of the most ugly phenomena in the world.\nThe book is absolutely in your hands. I am not in your hands; on the contrary, you are in my hands. That creates fear, that creates a trembling inside. That makes you alert that you are coming to a\ndangerous place – one step more and you may be gone, and then you will never be able to find yourself again.\nThe real work of the master is really murder: murder of that which you are not. The master takes away all that which is not really there, and strangely, gives you that which you have always been.\nFear is natural, it is a good sign. And when you fear someone, hatred arises – a natural consequence, a simple, logical process. The person is trying to destroy you. He is changing, transforming the way you think you are. He is killing what you think is most valuable in you. Hatred, extreme hatred... you began with extreme love, and you end up with extreme hate.\nBut you have to understand the whole process. This happens to everybody. People who come to me either come through reading my books or listening to their friends talk about me. They come here with a certain image of me, certain expectations of me. They don’t come clean, clear. And when they come here and they don’t find their expectations fulfilled, great hatred arises. But this is in a way natural to the state of sleep. Nothing is wrong with it; you just have to understand the process and you will be free of it.\nYou meet people who have gone a little ahead of you – and that’s one of the reasons for creating a commune. The gap between me and you may be too big, and you may not be able to just take a jump over the gap. The commune gives you a chance to jump in installments.\nYou meet somebody who is no longer a camel. He may not yet have become a lion, but certainly he is no longer a camel; he is in the process of transformation. That gives you courage that if the camel dies that does not mean your death. And in fact, with the death of the camel begins the birth of the lion.\nYou meet somebody whose lion is starting to roar, to declare to the whole world its freedom, courage, fearlessness. By chance you may come across a person who is just in the process of changing from a lion to a child. To see that is a miracle! The ferocious lion, the dangerous lion is turning into an innocent child. It gives you the hope that if it is possible for somebody else, it is possible for you too. And you may come across, by chance, the person who has become a child. That will give you immense trust, confidence – also a challenge.\nYou are meeting people here, you say, and listening to them you feel clarity, but you are afraid that when you are gone that clarity will be gone also. Remember, if you feel this clarity is going to be lost when you are gone from here, then it is not clarity; you are simply hypnotized. Not that somebody is hypnotizing you – people here in the commune are living their lives, nobody is interested in hypnotizing anybody else. Who has time?\nThis life is so short – to love, to live, to be – it is so short for a man who is seeking and searching for his inner truth. It is so long for those who are simply dragging, waiting deep down for death to come and release them.\nAll the religions are death-oriented. They are focused beyond death, they are turning their followers’ eyes beyond death. They are saying to them, “Don’t be bothered with life. Somehow manage to remain alive till the grave; don’t fall before you reach the grave. Just on the minimum level, remain alive.” That is not life, but vegetating.\nIf your clarity is authentic and not just the influence of a person who is a lion or a child, then it will remain with you – not only remain, it will grow. So be very alert not to be impressed, not to be influenced – those are poisons. They will give you false illusions of clarity, enlightenment.\nI have a disciple in Germany who had become enlightened many times. But the trouble was, whenever he came back to see me, his enlightenment would disappear. He was very angry. He said, “Whenever I am back in Germany I become enlightened, and I feel very grateful to you. Just to pay my respects, I come here, and my enlightenment is finished!”\nThe enlightenment that sannyasin was having was his autohypnosis. You can hypnotize yourself. Reading my books you can say, “This is the truth, and this is the truth I have always known. I had just forgotten it. The book has brought it back to me.” But this bookish enlightenment is not the true thing. You will have to face the master.\nMeetings with the camels will be very comfortable, because they are just like you. They are not strangers; you can understand their language, they can understand your language. You can see beauty in them, they can see beauty in you.\nMeeting with the lion is a little difficult, but after all, a lion is also an animal. There is a certain connection between the camel and the lion. The gap is not very big, you can take the jump. But at least you will be very much impressed – even if you remain a camel, you will be very much impressed. These lions become prophets and messiahs to you, because you know that you are a camel and only a lion can save you.\nAnd when the lion roars, you know he has power. You are getting hypnotized, but this hypnosis is of no use; it is a kind of intoxication. When you go back home to meet your family of camels there, you may start doubting whether you have really seen camels turning into lions. Your logical mind will say it is absurd: how can a camel become a lion? There is no way from being a camel to become a lion. Lions are born out of other lions, they are not born out of camels.\nIt is because of this logical training of the mind that Hindus don’t believe in converting anybody, Jews don’t believe in converting anybody. In fact, for centuries Hindus have kept their doors closed. They say a Hindu has to be born from other Hindus.\nThere is no way that a Mohammedan can become a Hindu; it is simply impossible that a Christian can become a Hindu. In fact, even within the Hindu fold there are four castes; nobody can move from one caste to another. A sudra is born a sudra, and he will die a sudra – he cannot become a brahmin. A warrior, a chhatriya, is destined to remain a chhatriya, – he cannot become a brahmin. The brahmin is the highest caste. Brahmins are born, not converted.\nJews also, for centuries, have believed that they are the chosen people of God. Now, it is up to God to make somebody a Jew. How can you convert anybody? – it is not within your power. And you are a superior race. Now, how can you change a man belonging to an inferior race? You cannot change his blood, you cannot change his bones, you cannot change his marrow, you cannot change his soul.\nThese are the two most ancient religions. Both have denied conversion. New religions, of course –\nChristianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism – have to convert people; otherwise, from where are they\ngoing to get numbers, congregations? If a Buddhist is only to be born from Buddhists, where are the Buddhists? Conversion is the idea of new religions to expand their empires.\nBack home you will start thinking perhaps you hallucinated here, perhaps you were hypnotized: you saw things which don’t happen in the natural course of things. Camels are born camels and die camels. So you start suspecting, doubting; your clarity is gone.\nAnd it is impossible for a lion to become a child. Perhaps a camel may manage – camels are cunning and clever, very political and diplomatic. The camel may go through plastic surgery, he may go to Leeladhar and let himself be transformed into a lion. But even plastic surgery will not be able to make a child out of a lion. This is a bigger gap.\nAnimals – camel and lion both, howsoever different in shape – were animals, they belonged to the same category. But the child is not an animal. The jump is from animal to human being – and not an ordinary human being, but innocent, awakened, pure of heart, full of trust. No plastic surgery can do that, so you must have dreamed it.\nBack home amidst camels and their scholars and their logicians, you will feel yourself stupid even to say that you have seen lions, that you have seen the child being born as a transformation of the lion. Nobody is going to believe you, they will think you have gone nuts.\nThe gap between the camel and the lion is not very big, but the gap between the lion and the child is very big. And unless you are a child you cannot love a master. Now comes the biggest gap, because to love a master you will need certain qualities in you.\nWhat happens in ordinary love? Try to understand. You fall in love with a man or a woman. The qualities are in the woman with whom you have fallen in love: she is beautiful, she is young, she is juicy. You are falling in love without thinking at all about yourself, that you are not beautiful, that you are not young, that you are a completely dry bone, there is no juice. No, when you fall in love you are completely focused on the object of love, you are not thinking about yourself. This is the ordinary love which is going to change any moment into hate.\nThe love I have been talking about is the love where the whole structure is just the opposite of your love. You don’t fall in love with a master because the master has charisma, because the master has some influence, he catches hold of your heart; or because he is convincing – whatsoever he says seems absolutely right. No, if this is the way, it is not going to last long.\nThe love I am talking about means you have to think of your qualities. Are you as innocent as a child, as trusting as a child, as open as a child, as silent as a child? If your love arises out of your child, your innocence, then whether the master lives or dies will not make any difference. Whether the master says this or contradicts that will not affect your love. The master may be contradicting himself continually. That will not affect your love because it was not dependent on the master’s statements.\nYour innocence is not an ordinary thing, it is something immensely valuable. In your innocence you will be able to see that in the contradictory statements of the master there is no contradiction, that there is a hidden connection between them, that in fact they are not contradictions but part of each other – complementaries, not contradictions.\nCan light exist without darkness? Can darkness exist without light? Can man exist without woman or vice versa? Can life exist without death or vice versa? These are not contradictions, these are complementaries. They are two sides of the same coin, they are always together.\nOnly very mediocre minds are consistent. Idiots are absolutely consistent, they never contradict; in fact they never say anything, so there is nothing to contradict. Their whole life is a simple consistency: they remain idiotic, they keep their quality of idiocy just the same. From the cradle to the grave they are the most consistent people in the world, nothing changes in them. They are really dead; they don’t have any intelligence.\nThe more intelligent a person is, the more he has to contradict himself, because each moment his vision is growing, each moment his insight is deepening, each moment brings new facts, new truths. And he is not a coward who closes his eyes to that which is opening up in front of him. And he is under no obligation to the past – that which he had said in his childhood he has to repeat when he is a young man, when he is old, to remain consistent.\nIntelligence is such a growing, expanding phenomenon, and each small truth discovered changes the whole map. You cannot go on keeping the old intact; the old has to be dropped and the new has to be accepted. Do you know, all the religions insist that that which is old is gold. The older it is, the golder it is. Each religion tries to stretch its oldness as far back as possible.\nWhen Christians came in contact with Hinduism they felt very inferior, because the Christian religion says God created the world four thousand and four years before Jesus was born – there is no past beyond that. In fact, you can go back only to Jesus Christ; you cannot even go beyond him, because beyond him is Judaism. Christianity is only two thousand years old. In India Christians came across scriptures ten thousand years old. They were simply confused – what to make of it?\nThey had tried their best to bring everything within six thousand years. That’s why they go on insisting that the Hindu religion is five thousand years old. But the evidence is not in their favor. They may go on teaching that to the Christians – who are already convinced, there is no need to bring evidence before them – but all the evidence shows that Hinduism is at least ninety thousand years old.\nIn the most ancient Hindu scripture, the RIGVEDA, there is a description of a configuration of stars which, according to the astronomers, really did happen ninety thousand years ago. And since then that certain configuration of stars has not happened again. And it is described in full detail; the RIGVEDA is certainly ninety thousand years old – it may be older, but that much is certain. In no other scripture of the world is that configuration described, because they all were latecomers.\nBut Hinduism finds it difficult to prove that it is older than Jainism, because the Jainas’ first master, Adinatha, is referred to with great respect in the RIGVEDA. Now, contemporaries are never referred to with such respect – contemporaries are criticized.\nJesus was crucified by Jews, and now the great rabbis and the pope are trying to come together and forget the past. The pope has informed all his congregations around the world, “We have to drop this anti-Jewish attitude that we have carried for two thousand years unnecessarily. One Jew, the high priest, was responsible. For his responsibility you cannot make all the generations that follow responsible.”\nNow, Jews are also willing – there is no problem, Jesus is no longer a disturbance. But to the contemporary Jews he was a nuisance. No contemporary Jewish scripture even mentions the name of Jesus. There is no information about his crucifixion. It was such a big event, killing an innocent man, who may have been a little bit out of his mind, but that is not a crime. Everybody has the birthright to go out of his mind, there is no problem in it. If Jesus needed anything, he needed sympathy; he needed treatment, not crucifixion.\nBut the contemporary Jews were very much disturbed, because he was proclaiming himself the messiah the Jews had been waiting for. “I am the one,” he said, “for whom you have waited so long. Now I have come to save you all.” A carpenter’s son, uneducated, coming from a small village, Bethlehem They have seen him cutting wood, chopping wood, working with his father in his small\nworkshop making benches and chairs, and suddenly has this boy gone mad? He has become the\nmessiah who is going to deliver everybody from all their sins!\nJainas say, “If Adinatha is so respectfully mentioned in the RIGVEDA even though he was against the brahmins, against the brahmin religion How can the RIGVEDA mention his name with such\nrespect?” The logic seems to be significant. They are saying that Adinatha must have preceded the RIGVEDA by a few centuries, and by that time he was no longer a contemporary. Now his name can be mentioned with respect, he cannot do any harm. Jainism also does not believe in converting anybody. A Jaina is born a Jaina; you cannot become a Jaina.\nEverybody is trying to take their religion as far back as possible. Why? What is the argument behind it? The older the religion is, the truer. But new religions like Mohammedanism, which is only fourteen hundred years old, and Sikhism, which is only five hundred years old, are in great trouble. They have also been trying to find something against all these old religions which prove their truth by their age – as if religion is like wine; the older it is, the better.\nMohammedans say the latest religion in the world is Mohammedanism. And of course, when man was primitive, God gave the RIGVEDA to the world, because people could not understand more than that. Its age only proves that it was given to primitives, aboriginals who were just coming out of the trees and trying to learn to walk on the ground. Naturally, God could not give them the ultimate truth; nobody would have understood it.\nNow is the time, they say. Now means fourteen hundred years ago, when God decided man was grown-up enough, and he sent his last messenger – because now there will be no need to improve upon it; he has given his final judgment.\nMohammedanism, Sikhism try to prove.… Sikhism says, “Even Mohammedanism is old. We are only five hundred years old. There must have been some confusion because God has sent the latest message now with Nanak, the founder of Sikhism.”\nThat message too, is now five hundred years old. Do you want me to say that I bring you the last message? I am not going to say it. I am not going to be in the company of all these fools who have been trying somehow to make their religion look bigger, higher, truer.\nI say to you that I am not bringing anybody’s message – because there is nobody! I want you to understand that I am simply trying to share my experience with you. It is always fresh, always young; it is always in the now, in the here. That is a fundamental quality of truth.\nAnd I’m not saying that after me there will be nobody who will experience it. On the contrary, I am saying to you that if you understand me, there are going to be millions of people after me who will go on and on and on discovering more and more. Even if they have to contradict me, don’t bother about it – let them contradict. Who am I? I am not closing the doors. I am not putting a lock on the door and taking the keys with me. My house is without doors. It is open from everywhere – and I want it to remain always open.\nNaturally, people who will be coming will make new arrangements of the furniture in the house. They may plan a new architecture for the house, they may make new plans for the garden. I leave it to them, but the process will be the same.\nThis is a great jump, from the child to the master. The child is innocent, full of love. He falls in love with a master because something in his innocence, in his lovingness, in his openness, resounds with the heartbeat of the master. He in fact does not go into a relationship with the master, he becomes one with the master; hence it is a great jump. You are completely disappearing. But don’t be worried, the master has disappeared long before you, and in disappearing he has found himself.\nIf you are courageous enough to disappear in the master, you will find yourself for the first time. Then you can move amongst camels – in fact, you can ride on them. You can play with lions, you can commune with children. You can commune with flowers, with rivers, with mountains. Now there is no barrier for you. Now you are as big as the whole universe.\nP.D. Ouspensky, in his great contribution to humanity, TERTIUM ORGANUM I have come across\nmore books perhaps than anybody else in the whole world, but TERTIUM ORGANUM has a beauty that no other book has. Your bibles and gitas and korans and talmuds, all are far behind.\nIn TERTIUM ORGANUM Ouspensky states one thing which is tremendously beautiful for you to understand. He says, “In ordinary mathematics” – and he was one of the greatest mathematicians of this century – “in ordinary mathematics, the part is smaller than the whole, the whole is bigger than the part. It would be absurd in ordinary mathematics to say that the part is equal to the whole.” And this is coming from a mathematician. He says, “But I have discovered a new mathematics, a higher mathematics, where the part is equal to the whole – not only that, sometimes bigger than the whole.”\nIt looks mysterious, not logical – certainly against Aristotle. But I say to you, he is talking about the mathematics of consciousness. When you dissolve, you don’t become just a part of the whole, you become the whole. And there is every possibility that you go on growing and become bigger than the whole, because growth is the ultimate law of life.\nIt will be difficult logically to understand it. It is something to be experienced. Since the moment I found the ego evaporating from me, I have not felt part of the universe, but the universe itself. And yes, I have found many moments when I am bigger than the universe – because I can see the stars moving within me, the sunrise happening within me, all the flowers blossoming within me.\nBut don’t believe in it because I am saying it. Take the jump from the child to the master. Miss Camel, it is time: you should stop missing!\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHY AM I SO AFRAID OF BEING FREE?\nEverybody is. Freedom is a great risk. People talk about freedom, but nobody really wants to be free. It is pure talk. Everybody wants to be dependent, everybody wants somebody else to take the responsibility. In freedom you are responsible for every act, every thought, every movement. You cannot dump anything on anybody else.\nJust watch a Freudian psychiatrist, psychoanalyst. The patient is lying down on a couch, the psychoanalyst is sitting behind so the patient cannot see him. He is sitting behind the couch; he can see the patient, but the patient cannot see him. Some psychoanalysts use curtains so that the patient feels he need not keep his secrets to himself.\nAnd what happens – in all psychoanalysis sessions all over the world, what is happening? The patient goes on dumping everything either on the mother – mostly on the mother – or on the father. But he is not taking any responsibility upon himself. He is trying to prove that he is absolutely innocent; everybody else is at fault and driving him to do things that he never wanted to do in the first place.\nPerhaps there is some truth in it, that’s how it is happening: mothers are driving their children... mothers are trying to make their daughters real ladies – British ladies! American won’t do. In fact, in America the lady has disappeared. In California there are only women, no ladies. The father is trying to make his son a real man, a gentleman. So there is some truth in it.\nBut when you are grown-up and you see the whole scene, what has happened, you can simply drop it – just like that! But you don’t want to, because then you will be responsible. If right now you do something wrong, you can always point towards somebody who is responsible for it.\nEverybody is afraid of freedom. That’s why all around the world, layers of slaveries exist in you. Every person is a multiple slave. He is a slave to the parents, he is a slave to the religion, he is a slave to the state, he is a slave to the neighbors – all kinds of slaveries which are not visible.\nWhen I was a student in the university, I had a roommate with me for the whole year, and I had never thought that something was wrong with his speech. Then his father came to meet him and he started stuttering. I was amazed; I said, “What is the matter with you? Since your father has come you have been stuttering, you cannot speak the way you have always been speaking.”\nHe said, “From my very childhood he has been teaching me how to speak, what to speak, what not to speak, whom to speak to, when to speak. He confused me so much that I lost my own sensibility, and stuttering started.” He said, “I was amazed myself when I came to the university: leaving the house behind, my stuttering disappeared. And whenever I go to my house and to my family and to my town, the stuttering starts again.”\nI asked him, “When you go to the temple and pray to the father, God, what happens?”\nHe said, “The same thing, stuttering comes in. The very word”father” is enough – any father-figure.”\nWhen he was called for something by the vice-chancellor of the university, I went with him. He asked\nme, “Why are you coming?”\nI said, “You don’t be worried. I will be just outside the room waiting for you.” “But,” he said, “there is no need.”\nI said, “I will explain it to you afterwards.”\nAnd inside the room of the vice-chancellor, he was stuttering. I had to enter without asking permission. Both were shocked. He was shocked because he was stuttering. The vice-chancellor was shocked also: “Don’t you know that you have to ask permission? And I am talking to somebody.”\nI said, “The situation was such that I had to come in suddenly. I wanted to catch him stuttering before you for two reasons: I want to make it clear to him that it is not that something is wrong in him. Any father-figure, any authoritative figure causes his stuttering. And you are the highest authority in the university, so I wanted you also to know: please come down, don’t make poor students stutter; you are not a big daddy. That’s why I had to come in without asking, and suddenly. And I have caught you both red-handed. You are being authoritative, and that is ugly. You are imposing something on the poor student, who is already burdened with his daddy.”\nThe vice-chancellor said, “Perhaps you are right – I was shouting at him. I will never do such a thing to anybody again; I don’t want my students to stutter. When he started stuttering I was puzzled, ‘What is the matter? Perhaps this is his habit.’”\nI said, “It is not his habit. He has been living with me for the whole year, and he has not stuttered a single time. But when his father came, immediately things changed. Since then I have been watching: in the temple when he prays to God the father, he stutters. I wanted to see what happens between you and him. He is stuttering – you must have been behaving authoritatively. There is no need. You have to be more human, you have to be more friendly, you have to be more loving. You are not his father.”\nNow this student came out with me, and he said, “My father is responsible.”\nI said, “No, you are a coward. Every father is trying to improve upon the son, because the son is going to take his place sooner or later. That does not mean that the whole humanity is stuttering. You are a weakling, and you are avoiding that responsibility. Just accept that you have been a coward; otherwise, what is so great in your father? I have seen him. In fact, you are taller than your father. If you wrestled with him you would win, because he is getting old and you are in your prime, healthy and young.\n“And that old, small man makes you stutter! Still you throw the responsibility on him. This is slavery,\nmental slavery. But it gives you a relief that you are not the cause of it.”\nWho is forcing you to go to the church, to the temple, to the synagogue? Yes, when you were a child you were taken, but now? Still you are continuing the old routine. And if you are forced to\nexplain, you will say, “It was my father who dragged me to the synagogue. It was my Jewish mom who dragged me to this or that.”\nYou don’t see it as a slavery. It is a slavery. You have not been fighting against it. Yes, I know, small children are dependent on the parents, and the parents take every advantage of your dependence. They know you cannot rebel, they know you cannot go anywhere else.\nI figured out in my very childhood what makes them so authoritative: “Perhaps they think I cannot rebel. Perhaps they think I cannot get food if I go against them. Perhaps they think I will be lost in this vast world without their protection.” So I had to do all these things; only then would they understand that authority was not going to work with me. I made it clear to my father, “One thing is absolutely certain: if you want me to do something, please don’t say it authoritatively.”\nHe said, “Then in what way has it to be said?”\nI said, “You have to ask me, ‘Will you please do it?’”\nHe said, “This seems to be too much. I have to ask my own son, ’Will you please do it?”\nI said, “You will have to say this. If you say to me ‘Go and do it!’ I am the last person to do it. I would prefer to die hungry, but I will not do it. And if you ask me, ‘Will you please do it?’ I can even climb Everest – there is no problem. I am doing it, it has not been forced upon me. I don’t want to live like a slave in my life.”\nOne day my father was not at home. My uncle told me, “Lately I have been seeing that you come in at any time of the night. You have to be back home before nine o’clock” – because in India nine o’clock is really night. It is not evening; the sun-sets at six, and then suddenly everything becomes dark.\nI said, “You don’t know the contract between me and my father. You can be certain I will never enter\nthe house unless nine o’clock has passed.”\nHe had no children; he was just married and he was very cocky. In fact, the Indian word for uncle is kaka – and he was trying to be the master of his wife. He said, “I repeat it again. If you don’t come before nine, then I am not going to open the door.”\nI said, “That is settled. I will remain outside the door the whole night, but I am not going to accept authority in any way.” And that’s what happened. He was thinking that in one hour, two hours, I would drop the idea of remaining for the whole cold night outside.\nIn fact he became worried. My father was not in the town, and if I became sick or something happened to me... The night was really cold and it was getting colder. And he could not sleep either, because he was waiting for me to knock. Finally, nearabout twelve, he opened the door and he said, “Forgive me, just come in. Don’t create trouble for me.”\nI said, “I am not creating trouble for anybody. I am simply keeping myself trouble-free.”\nIn the school, in the college, I always loved to be a little mischievous. I felt those students who were not mischievous to be just dull and dead. So I would do something Just sitting in the class I might\nstart what you do in darshan or satsang – I might start “Om-m-m” with closed mouth. Now “Om” is a religious, sacred word to the Hindus. Nobody can say that this is wrong to do; but in the class when the teacher was teaching, and he was writing on the board and his back was towards us.…\nHe turned suddenly, looked all around – everybody was silent – and he asked, “Who was making this sound of Om?”\nAnd I would always stand up. I would say, “I did it. It is a sacred sound.” He said, “I know, but in a class when I am teaching you something”\nI said, “You cannot teach anything higher than Om! And why are you getting so freaked out? You should have continued your work. Om would have remained in the background; it is not a problem.”\nHe would drag me to the principal – it was almost an everyday ritual. The principal would say, “So you have come. Can’t you leave these professors at ease even for a single day?”\nI said, “Today I was doing such a spiritual thing. And I could have remained silent when he asked who had done it. I know perfectly well that nobody in my class can point his finger towards me, because they all know that I will create trouble for them, they are perfectly aware of it. There was no way for him to find out. I stood up myself. In fact, he should be respectful towards me: I did it, I accept it.”\nMany professors have asked me, “Why? You are such a nice guy in every possible way, we cannot\nfind a better student. But once in a while, what goes on? You start doing something which is\nunexpected.”\nI said, “It is not unexpected, at least as far as I am concerned. It is absolutely prepared.” “But why do you do it?” they would ask.\nI would say, “For a single reason, that I don’t want to become a slave in any way. I want to keep my freedom intact whatsoever the cost. If I feel like chanting ‘Om’, then I don’t care what happens to me. I chanted it, and I have not harmed anybody; I have simply saved my freedom. And I take the whole responsibility for it!”\nIn the school, the headmaster stopped even asking why I had been brought, because it was an everyday affair – sometimes twice a day – that I would be brought to the headmaster. In the beginning he used to enquire, “What has he done? What happened?” – this and that. After a few days he stopped enquiring, he simply gave me the punishment.\nHe would say, “Go around the whole building seven times.”\nI would say, “Yes, that’s okay, but I will go nine times – not less than that.” He said, “Are you mad? This is a punishment, we are not rewarding you!”\nI said, “That is my way of changing the quality of the punishment. I am enjoying it – the wind is cool, the trees are beautiful. Why seven? At least I cannot accept your order. I will go nine times; then I am free of your authority, I am doing it on my own, and I’m enjoying it! And you should remember that to be authoritative is ugly – you have to understand me, why I did it. You don’t care to understand. You simply listen to the teacher, you don’t even give a chance for me to explain.”\nThat day he said, “Okay, what do you have to say? You were keeping your hand on a boy’s shoulder in the class. In the classroom some discipline has to be maintained, and you know it. The classroom is not some place of entertainment – a park, a cinema hall. There you can walk with your hands on someone’s shoulders, but not in the class.”\nI said, “I walked in the class with my hand on another student’s shoulder simply to make this teacher freak out – because in the class he continually says smoking is bad, and I have caught him red- handed, smoking. Now this man should apologize to the whole class, because he was lying to them when he said, ‘Don’t smoke.’ He himself smokes. He says to the students, ‘Don’t go to the movies,’ and one day when I was entering the movie house for the second show, he was coming out from the first show.\n“When I asked, ‘What are you doing here?’ He said, ‘I am your teacher, you are not my teacher. You have no right to ask what I am doing here.’ Is this a human way of behaving? I deny all kinds of authoritativeness. And still he goes on telling the students, ‘Don’t go to the movies, don’t waste your time. Don’t destroy your eyes’ – this and that. And he is a regular visitor to the movie house.”\nThe movie house belonged to one of my friends’ father, so I had told the friend, “Keep me informed how often he comes to the movie.” He was a regular visitor, and a chain-smoker outside the class.\n“I had to do something so that he can bring me to you, and I can expose his reality. Now what do you say? Should I do nine rounds around the school or he? As far as I am concerned, we both can go together, it is perfectly good.”\nSince that day, that headmaster stopped punishing me. He would always ask, “Why? What was the reason?” And he was always satisfied with the reason. In fact, teachers stopped sending me to the headmaster, because there they found themselves guilty of doing something wrong. By and by, they stopped preventing me from doing anything, because if I am doing something, that means there must be much more to it – what can a teacher do?\nMy headmaster changed and a new headmaster came into the school. And the first day I went, he took his cane and he said, “I am a strict man, and from the very first day I make it known to the school that I am going to beat you badly.”\nI said, “You can do it – but can you see, just there on the other side of the road is the police station. And corporal punishment is illegal – you start beating me and you will be behind bars! The court is not far away, and I am a great friend of an old advocate who is the best advocate in the town. And I have told him that this is going to happen: ‘I have heard about this man, that he beats students.’ And he has promised me, ‘Let him do it – you come immediately to me and we will file a suit against him in the court.’ So I have made my position clear to you. Now, start beating.”\nHis cane fell from his hand. He said, “Are you a student or some government agency?”\nI said, “I am a simple student, but I don’t want any authoritativeness over me. If I do anything wrong, I am ready for any punishment. But just punishing me to prove your authority? I am the last one to accept it.”\n“And I was not wrong – the teacher has brought me to you.… It is revengeful, because the other headmaster had stopped punishing me. Rather, he had started telling the teachers, ‘It was not right on your part.’ And today I have not done anything. Just when the teacher called me, I was sitting on the bench with my legs on top of it. I don’t see that it is a crime, I was simply relaxed. In fact, children should be provided with chairs which are comfortable, with foot-rests so they can relax.”\nWhen you are relaxed you can understand things more easily. But in Indian schools the benches are hard – it is just a copy of British benches; in British schools the benches are hard. You have to sit on those hard benches for six hours and it starts hurting.\n“Something is wrong with you people. You are not teaching us but torturing us, and under torture no teaching is possible. So I want to know what wrong I have committed. Have I given a wrong answer to his question? No, I was just keeping my feet on top of the table. These are my feet. If I drag his feet and put them on the table, you can punish me. But if you think this is a crime, you start punishing me, and I will see you in the court.”\nOne has to understand one thing: What can happen? At the most, death can happen. Remember a simple maxim: Hope for the best, and wait for the worst. Then nobody in this life can disappoint you. Nobody can make you a slave, physically or psychologically.\nA Hindu is a slave, a Christian is a slave, a Mohammedan – all these religions are psychological slaveries, because they give you consolation that if you follow and believe and have faith, then nothing wrong is going to happen to you. They give you all kinds of strategies to remain dependent. They teach you prayer – prayer is just begging.\nI don’t teach you any prayer. To whom are you praying? You have not even asked the people who have taught you prayer. Kneeling down on your church floor, you are humiliating yourself. I am not for egoist assertion, but neither am I for humiliation to be accepted as humility, humbleness. I want you to be simple, without any ego and without any humbleness – straightforward, clear.\nAnd freedom is such a great value – perhaps the greatest value in life. It cannot be lost for anything. Even if death is the consequence – I would rather accept death than accept anything that goes against my freedom.\nIndia was under the British Raj for almost three hundred years. My whole family was in the freedom movement; they all have been in jails. I was too young, but I was continually arguing with my father, with my uncles, “Don’t blame Britain for your slavery. Such a vast country, almost a continent, cannot be made a slave by a small country like England. Somewhere deep down you are afraid of being free, somewhere deep down you are ready to accept slavery. And still you go on throwing the responsibility on Britain. But you have been a slave before too” – India has been in slavery for two thousand years. Masters changed, slavery remained.\n“It is such a simple thing to see that if anybody wanted to make you a slave, you became a slave, as\nif you were just waiting for it, for somebody to invade you, somebody to come and enslave you.”\nI told my family, “I don’t accept the idea of Mahatma Gandhi, that Britain is responsible for India’s slavery. India itself is responsible for its slavery; otherwise, just in a single hour, all the British people can be thrown into the ocean. India just has to understand that freedom is our birthright. How many Britishers are there? Not many.”\nIs your mental slavery somebody else’s responsibility? No. You don’t want to be responsible for your own acts, you don’t want to be responsible for your way of life; that’s why you are afraid of being free. Drop this fear. This fear is worse than anything that can happen to anybody.\nI teach you responsibility. But remember, don’t misunderstand me, because all around you people are using the word “responsibility” with an absolutely different meaning – in fact, diametrically opposite to the meaning I see in the word responsibility.\nThey say, “Be responsible to your parents.” That is not responsibility, that is slavery. They say, “Be responsible to your church, to your religion, to your faith.” That is not responsibility, that is slavery. They say, “Be responsible to your nation.” That is not responsibility. These are all beautiful words to cover up an ugly fact: slavery.\nWhen I use the word “responsibility,” I use it the way it should be used. Responsibility means that whatever you do, it is your response. If I ask you, “Does God exist?” and you say, “Yes, because it is written in THE BIBLE,” your answer is not a responsible answer. It is out of your Christian slavery.\nBut if you say, “I don’t know. I have never come across God yet,” this is your response. You are not repeating some catechism – Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish – no. You are facing the question directly and responding to it. Responding on your own is the meaning of responsibility.\nFreedom brings responsibility. Responsibility helps you to become more and more free. And only a person who knows the taste of freedom, who knows the beauty of responsibility, is worthy of calling himself a human being; otherwise, you are camels and nothing more.\nCHAPTER 22\nYou are the only hope\n20 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nARE YOU A MESSIAH, A PROPHET, OR A REINCARNATION OF GOD?\nI have never expected that one of my sannyasins would ask such a bullshit question!\nI am simply myself. I am not a messiah, because there is no God to send messengers to the world. Moreover, I don’t want to be crucified. To prove that you are a messiah of God, crucifixion is absolutely necessary. Not that I am afraid of death, but I would like a comfortable, luxurious death. Not carrying the cross on my own shoulders, not even on your shoulders – the cross will be carried on a Rolls Royce limousine.\nI am not a prophet either. I don’t know what is going to happen in the next moment. I don’t know even what I am going to say in the next moment. The future does not exist for me. That’s exactly the meaning of the future: that which does not exist. And the prophet is one who prophesies, predicts. This is the most cunning business in the whole world.\nAnd how can I be an incarnation of God? God is invented by those people who want to be incarnations of God. Their God is phony – American, plastic. And all those prophets, messiahs and messengers of God, incarnations of God, what have they done to the world?\nLook... in five thousand years, all these people have turned the earth into a big madhouse. What kinds of things have they been telling you to do? What kind of belief systems have they imposed\nupon you? They have humiliated you, degraded you, turned you into a subhuman species. All these messiahs, prophets, gods – they have made life impossible, love impossible, laughter impossible. They have made the whole earth a big graveyard.\nAnd they have all been fighting with each other. Millions of people have been killed because of these few criminals. Somebody is a Christian – that means he is conditioned by the ideology of Jesus Christ. That man, Jesus, was a crackpot! He was trying to save the whole world; he could not save himself. He was telling people things which are absurd.\nHe was telling the people, “Blessed are the poor.” As a corollary he must have said, “Blessed are the ugly, blessed are the blind, blessed are the deaf, blessed are the crippled.” All the blessed people are in the hospitals. The most blessed of all are in Ethiopia. There is going to be a tremendous fight on the day of judgement to decide who is the most poor – because of course, if the poor are the blessed, then the poorest is the Blessed One.\nForget it! No American can enter paradise. Nobody who has at least two meals every day can enter paradise. You are all going to be defeated by Ethiopians, by Indians. The western world has no hope!\nBut why did Jesus say, “Blessed are the poor”? He himself was poor, uneducated, uncultured. There was no way for him to rise higher in any hierarchy, to become richer, affluent, to have all the joys and comforts of life. It was not possible for him, he was not capable of it – and he saw millions of other people in the same boat. It was a self-consolation: Blessed are the poor. I wonder why he did not say, “Blessed are the poor carpenters”? He consoled himself, he consoled the poor people.\nDo you know who was attracted to his teachings? – not a single man who was rich, educated, who was living life joyously. He attracted miserable people, poor people, starving people – and even they did not come in multitudes.\nThose who came to Jesus, you can count on your fingers. But they were feeling great – this man has opened a door for their egos. This man is the only begotten son of God; they had to believe it, because unless they believed that he is the only begotten son of God, then what about his promises about paradise? They believed in him – not truly; they simply wanted a consolation, sympathy, and a hope that some day they will take revenge on the rich, on those who are enjoying life and its beauties.\nOf course, it was not possible even for Jesus to give them those blessings here, now. They had to wait for death to come. Everything he promises is after death. You can see the strategy. Nobody comes back and says what there is after death. You can see the strategy. You can befool people: just keep them drugged about the future life after death. And those poor people, of course, wanted to live blissfully. They had failed here; now comes this man – a carpenter, Joseph’s son – and gives them a great hope, a promise.\nBut all those twelve apostles were simply idiots. Not a single one of them had enough intelligence to wonder what was happening. Jesus turns stones into bread, why can’t he turn all the mountains into great loaves of bread? He knows the secret, and once you know a secret, it is only a questions of using it on a bigger scale. There would have been nobody poor.\nHe changes water into wine – why not change all the oceans into wine? Nobody will feel thirsty ever again. He raises dead people from their graves. But why only one person? Why only Lazarus? In Jesus’ lifetime, many people must have died; he should have raised all of them. And if he can raise a person who has been dead for four years, he can raise a person who has been dead for four thousand years – Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel. He could have raised all the prophets, at least, back to life. But all these are stories invented to prove that this man is no ordinary man: he is a messiah, he has extraordinary powers.\nI don’t claim any powers, extraordinary or ordinary. I am a simple human being. I don’t want to put myself on a high pedestal and condemn you all for your sins, curse you all for your sins, and bless only those few who have faith in me.\nThe same is true about other messengers of God, incarnations of God. For example, Krishna is a Hindu incarnation of God – not a partial incarnation, God has come in his wholeness on the earth to save it. Strange, nobody seems to be saved. In fact, Krishna was the cause of destroying the very backbone of India, because he forced his disciple and friend, Arjuna, into a war.\nFive thousand years ago that war happened. The whole responsibility goes to Krishna – because Arjuna, the warrior, seeing millions of people, started thinking, “What is the point of it all? – killing all these people just to sit on a golden throne? There will not even be people to see that you are sitting on a golden throne. What is the point?”\nArjuna was far more intelligent than your incarnation of God, Krishna. Arjuna said, “This war seems to be absolutely meaningless. I am going to the Himalayas to meditate. Let my cousin-brothers rule, but at least there will be life. I am not going to take this great responsibility of killing so many people for my own glory, to become Arjuna the Great.”\nBut Krishna is very clever, very cunning. He goes on arguing, convincing, persuading Arjuna. And finally he says to Arjuna, “You don’t understand that God wants this war, because without him not even a leaf in a tree moves. You are not responsible if people are killed; it is God’s will.”\nAnd when you bring God in and relieve people of their responsibility, it becomes difficult to refuse. I would have certainly refused it, but Arjuna had a conditioned mind. Krishna says, “God’s WILL!... the war has to happen whether you participate or not. By not participating you will fall in the eyes of God. The war will happen.” His actual words are, “You see these millions of warriors on both the sides gathered, alive? In fact, they are just waiting to die. They are dead, you are not killing them. You cannot do anything on your own; you are just a puppet in the hands of God.”\nGod is the greatest lie that these people have been teaching. And in the name of God you can convince people to do any stupid thing.\nIf I had been in the place of Arjuna I would have said, “Perfectly okay, I am going to the Himalayas. How can I go to the Himalayas if God is not willing me to go there? Let him kill these people through other puppets.”\nIt was so simple. But Krishna goes on forcing him: “You are born in a warrior family, you are a warrior\nby nature, from your very birth. This will be dropping out. It will be ugly, shameful to you and\nto your whole family and to your forefathers. Don’t be a coward! Prove your mettle – the opportunity has come!” And he forced Arjuna into a war which is called Mahabharata, the Great Indian War. It must have been something like the third world war which is looming on the horizon. And there are so many Arjunas; only one Krishna is needed to convince some Arjuna to start it, to be the pioneer.\nIt must have been of tremendous proportions, because since that war, India has never been able to regain its strength. It has been going down and down; it lost courage, it lost the joy of life. It became too concerned about death. Any religion which is concerned too much about death is fundamentally wrong. And all the religions are death-oriented.\nHence I say, all these messiahs, prophets, incarnations of God are simply clever, cunning politicians. They have destroyed humanity, they have poisoned you in every possible way. Whatsoever you enjoy is a sin, and whatsoever you suffer is virtue. Look at their logic! They have made you all into sado- masochists. You cannot recognize it, because all around you are the same kind of people. Just in names they differ – Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, Buddhists – but fundamentally what they have done, and are doing, is exactly the same.\nIf you relish life, you are condemned. If you renounce life, you are respected. If you enjoy the beautiful treasures that existence makes available to you, you are going into the abysmal depth and darkness of hell. But if you torture yourself... you stand on your head in the hot sun of Oregon doing yoga exercises – which are nothing but inventions of somebody who must have been a masochist – torturing yourself. You fast; the longer you fast, the more spiritual you become.\nI don’t see any connection between food and spirituality, between hunger and spirituality. And if hunger is spiritual, rejoice about Ethiopia! Those people are becoming holier and holier every day. Strange that the missionaries – the pope, Mother Teresa, and their kind – are appealing that “Ethiopia should be saved; people are starving, people are hungry, people are dying in thousands.” This is contradictory.\nEthiopia today is the most holy land in the whole world. And if thousands are dying, they will be entering paradise; they are the poorest people in the world. Christians, particularly Catholics, should rejoice all over the world that Ethiopia has become the real holy land – it is no longer Israel. But they are asking for help, for food, for people to come and save these dying, hungry people. For what? to convert them to Catholicism?\nThese religious leaders need the world to remain poor; otherwise they are out of a job. Mother Teresa receives the Nobel prize because she takes care of orphans. Orphans are absolutely needed; otherwise Mother Teresa loses her Nobel prize. It is necessary to create more orphans so more Mother Teresas can be there. They become respectable, they receive prizes, honorary degrees. They are welcomed all over the world, they are thought to be great saints.\nAnd to create more orphans, birth control methods should not be used. Abortion should be illegal, criminal. If birth control methods are used, and abortion is legal, then from where can you get the orphans? Those orphans give business to the priests, to the pope. And those orphans are your power, because you will convert them to your religion. It is a simple politics of numbers.\nI would say: if you don’t want poor and hungry people, starving people and dying people, and\ncountries like Ethiopia, then you have to get rid of all your messiahs, your prophets, your incarnations of God, because they are basically, originally responsible for all this misery, suffering, pain.\nNo, I absolutely deny having any kind of relationship with these people. I am a simple human being, just the way you are. I am not special in any way.\nThis is something momentous and historical that is happening here, because never before have people gathered around an ordinary, simple man who has no extraordinary powers, who has no miracles to his credit, who does not walk on water Really, I find it difficult even to walk on earth. I\nam bobbily, almost a drunkard! Somehow I manage.\nThe day humanity is completely finished with these exploiters in the name of religion, this very earth can become a paradise. There is no need to wait for death. What has death to do with paradise? Paradise is the way you live. Paradise has something to do with life, not with death.\nIf you don’t listen to these people, just simple reasoning will show you that this much population on the earth is impossible – we have already crossed the borderline. Starvation is natural; nature is trying to keep the balance, and you don’t allow nature to keep the balance because you need more Catholics!\nWhy are people dying in poor countries? In the first place, why are those countries poor? – because poverty has been praised, poverty has been explained away by beautiful theologies.\nHindus say you are poor because in your past life you committed great sins. It seems to be a very delayed result. The cause was in some past life far away, and the effect comes now. You put your hand in the fire and wait for the next life for it to get burned! Cause and effect are connected; the cause is nothing but unmanifested effect. You cannot put them so far apart, and you cannot put death in between than. But Hindus have been doing that, Jainas have been doing that, Buddhists have been doing that.\nYou give beautiful explanations to the poor, you give them respectability. Mahatma Gandhi used to call the most poor people in India Harijanas, the people of God. If to be poor, to be condemned by the whole society... because Hindus don’t even touch them, they are called untouchables. You will be surprised, they don’t touch these people because there are so degraded; they don’t even allow their shadows to touch them. If an untouchable passes by and his shadow touches your body, you have to take a bath immediately to cleanse yourself – you have been polluted.\nAnd Gandhi calls them the people of God! If poverty, humiliation, oppression, exploitation, make you people of God, then why should one try to become rich? Because in the kingdom of God, even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man. Strange, camels are holier than a rich man. Only the poor can enter there.\nIf that is the truth, then let this whole world be poor, suffering, starving, dying. What is the need of serving the poor, giving them food, hospitals, schools? What is the need? You are destroying their license to heaven!\nNo, I don’t belong to this company. I absolutely disconnect myself from all the religions of the world\nthat have existed before, because I say to you, they were not religions. They were cunning strategies\nof clever people to exploit you, to keep you in your ugly situation, your disgusting state. These religions have not allowed you to make the earth the Garden of Eden. I don’t have a God above the roof of Rajneesh Mandir, so I cannot ask him, “Father, forgive these messiahs and prophets and incarnations of you, because they do not know what they are doing!”\nI cannot pray in this way for two reasons: one, there is no God above the roof – maybe some electrician working Secondly, I cannot say that these prophets and messiahs and incarnations of\nGod do not know what they are doing. They do know! They are perfectly aware of what they are doing. They are cheating you, they are keeping you repressed; they are forcing you to remain attached to the past, to the dead traditions, conventions, beliefs which have no evidence. They are preventing you from rebelling against this whole nonsense!\nTo me, the truly religious person is a rebel, and his religion will be rebellion against this state of affairs. I don’t want you to become faithful, I want you to doubt intensely all that you have been taught to believe.\nI don’t say, “Remain contented as you are because contentment is a great virtue.” Contentment is a great virtue, but these people are using the word very cunningly. The real contentment comes only when you are utterly happy, rejoicing, when you are so full of joy that you want to dance and you want to sing, and you want to share – because you have so much that if you don’t share it will become a heavy burden on you. Then there is contentment.\nBut these people have been telling you, “Remain contented as you are.” They are agents of politicians, they are agents of the status quo. They have not allowed you to think of passing through a great revolution so that we can have a better earth, a better humanity. They are not concerned with humanity at all.\nNo, I am not a messiah. And it is very difficult too, to become a messiah. First you have to be given birth to by a virgin girl – and who wants to be a bastard? Strange things are expected of you ... Mahavira does not perspire – I cannot manage that. Mahavira remains naked. There is nothing wrong in remaining naked, particularly in a hot country like India, but in winter when it becomes so cold, I don’t see any point. Yes, when the sun is there and it is hot, it is perfectly good to be nude – even in your office, sitting and working nude should be thought rational. But in winter when things are getting frozen, to remain naked I cannot do it.\nNaturally, I cannot enter in this club of messiahs, prophets and incarnations of God. But I am not sorry for that. I am immensely happy that I was not born from a virgin girl; I am happy that I am the son of my own father, not of somebody who is on the roof. I see utter ugliness in all these people. But they have made it philosophical, and it is all garbage, simply shit! But you can wrap around it beautiful philosophy, theology, and it becomes a commodity of great price.\nI am not with them, I am against them. And I am against them totally, because I never do anything partially. If an enlightened man – one who is alert, awake, conscious of reality – can do things like Krishna or Mohammed or Jesus did, then I don’t want even to be enlightened anymore.\nMohammed married nine wives. It is criminal – the wives are not human beings, they are just cattle. But Mohammed is nothing compared to Krishna, who had sixteen thousand wives. And these were\nnot women who had fallen in love with him: otherwise, I have no objection to it. These women were already married to somebody else. They were hijacked, forcibly taken away from their children, from their husbands, from their families.\nSixteen thousand women? But a perfect incarnation of God cannot just have one wife like an ordinary man! I don’t think that he could have even remembered the names of sixteen thousand women. And I don’t know whether those sixteen thousand women made love to Krishna. If it happened, he must have been the most spent man in the whole world.\nEven one woman is more powerful than man as far as her capacity to have sexual orgasm is concerned. A woman can have multiple sexual orgasms. A man is very poor in comparison, he can have only one – that too is not necessarily an orgasm, because for the orgasm to happen you need a little time, a little foreplay. You need to not be looking at your watch while making love.\nBut everybody is in such a hurry, without knowing where they are going. You are only concerned whether you are going with the topmost speed or not. Within seconds, the man’s love is finished. He turns to the other side and goes to sleep and starts snoring, and leaves the wife weeping and crying, because it has not even started and the man is finished.\nSixteen thousand women? – a sure way to commit suicide. No, I cannot do that. And don’t think that this must be simply mythological, it is not. It is a historical fact. I used to think it must be just mythological, but when I went to Hyderabad, a Mohammedan state in India, the Nizam of Hyderabad – the king of Hyderabad state – had five hundred wives in the twentieth century! I told the Nizam, “It is good I came here, met you and came to know about your five hundred wives. Now I can believe in Krishna and his sixteen thousand.”\nSixteen thousand are only thirty-two times more. And if it can happen in the twentieth century, then five thousand years ago you can think anything is possible. Man is still so superstitious; how much more superstitious must he have been five thousand years ago. But this was a certificate... because it is written in the Hindu scriptures, “When God comes on the earth, he will have sixteen thousand wives.” The scripture has to be fulfilled; only then will you be recognized by people as the complete incarnation of God.\nBecause Rama, another incarnation of God, had only one wife, he is thought to be a partial incarnation – just a little bit of God in him. Strange, I think... is it the quantity of women that is used as a criterion of how much godliness is in you? Then I don’t want this type of godliness. The woman is not a measurement. The woman is just like you.\nHave you ever thought about the word “woman”? It simply means a man with a womb. She has something more than you. If it is to be decided who is more, then the woman is more: she is a man with womb. And a womb is not an ordinary thing; it is something of immense value, because all life comes out of the womb.\nMan has always felt inferior to woman. Because he has felt inferior to woman, he has tried in every way to repress woman and make himself superior. It is a simple logic: only the inferior man wants to be superior. The superior is already superior, there is no question of wanting it. Unless man frees woman completely from all bondage – religious, political, social – he will never get rid of his own inferiority complex.\nThe freedom of woman is going to be the freedom of man too. It is not only woman’s liberation, it is as double-edged liberation. And science has given you all the means to be liberated now. The greatest revolution in human history, after the discovery of fire, was the pill. That makes you equal, unafraid of getting pregnant, unafraid of becoming dependent. And sex loses all the stupid ideas around it; it becomes simple, fun – neither sin nor virtue, but simply fun.\nI am the beginning of a totally new religious consciousness. Please don’t connect me with the past. It is not even worth remembering. It will a great blessing to humanity if we burn all the past histories, destroy the whole past, and give man a fresh beginning, unburdened. Make him again Adam and Eve, so that he can start from scratch – a new man, a new civilization, a new culture.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?\nMy God! My business? I am busy without business.\nI have heard.… One Sunday morning a hippie-type young man with long hair entered the biggest church of New York. It was very early; the people of the congregation had not started to come, but the bishop was there. Looking at this man, he asked, “Who are you? And what is your business to be here?” The hippie-type person laughed, and he said, “Can’t you recognize me? I am Jesus Christ.”\nAnd of course, Jesus Christ must have looked like a hippie – there is a similarity. Perhaps he was the first hippie. It is no coincidence that hippies go on turning into Jesus freaks; they have found the way.\nThe bishop got a little puzzled because he had never imagined in his life that Jesus Christ is going to appear in his church one morning. Now, how is he supposed to behave? He immediately had a long phone call with the pope. He said, “I am puzzled, confused, I don’t know what to do. A man here says he is Jesus Christ. And he says that he had promised to come back, and he has come back. What am I supposed to do?”\nThe pope was puzzled. For a moment there was silence, and then the pope said, “The most I can think of is, look busy. Who knows, he may be the Lord. Just look busy. And by the way, inform the police too.”\nI don’t even look busy. I am just doing nothing, and spreading this infectious at-ease to everybody. My whole message is: Sitting silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself. You cannot call it a business. But in the world you have to give some name – then I can call it a great show business.\nIn fact, from my very childhood I wanted to create a big circus. And it has happened; I am running the biggest circus around the world!\nI take life nonseriously.\nIt is a circus, it is a carnival.\nRejoice!\nWhen Jesus says rejoice, those words do not sound right on his lips. Just look at his face – so British, so long, as if he has always been on the cross, crucified. He is so serious that there exists not a single description or any picture or any statue in which he is smiling or laughing. He was a serious businessman.\nI am utterly nonserious. I don’t care whether this circus continues or stops; it does not matter. To\nme, what mattters is this moment. This pause between me and you is the bridge.\nI am not saying don’t work, I am saying transform your work into worship. Transform whatsoever you are doing into art, into music. Let it be a dance, not a burden and a duty. Let it be love, not marriage. Marriage is a serious affair; business people do it, with all the business considerations – financial, educational, social status. These are the considerations for marriage.\nLove can even fall in love with a wildflower. Love is not serious, it is sincere; it is truer than anything in life. But all other religions have been doing business, great business, and doing it seriously. All their so-called missionaries are nothing but salesmen. In their theological colleges they are taught for six years nothing but salesmanship.\nI am reminded of one person, Erhard, who created a little stir called EST. In the beginning the word “EST” meant Erhard Seminar Training. But later on, he found out from somebody that in the Greek language, EST means “is.” Then the meaning changed, he dropped the old meaning: he started talking about “is-ness.”\nBut before he started EST he was a salesman of dictionaries and encyclopedias. That is one of the most difficult jobs, to sell encyclopedias. Who wants encyclopedias? And even those who have them, they keep them just so that their drawing room looks a little literate; nobody turns the pages of the encyclopedia. And they are costly: thirty volumes, thirty-two volumes, thirty-six volumes – they cost a fortune.\nThis man selling encyclopedias was successful. He thought, “Even if I go on selling encyclopedias my whole life, how much am I going to get?” He gave it a little serious thinking, and he said, “If I can sell encyclopedias, why not do the real serious business of religion? Why not give people something which doesn’t exist – growth. Growth is just an American name for God.\nPeople are fed up with God; enough is enough. They don’t want to think about God. But growth? – they immediately become interested. Just two weekends for two hundred and fifty dollars or so, and growth happens to you. In fact he left all other competitors far behind. Esalen started dying because the people were going to Erhard.\nAnd you must know that Erhard is not his real name. The name sounds German. Whenever you want something to sound solid, real, a German name is good; it is just like steel. He is a Jew. He must have thought, “Who is going to get this commodity of growth from a Jew?” From the very beginning they will become suspicious, doubtful. A Jew selling growth? Jews have been selling\nall kinds of things, but about religion they have been failures. They missed the biggest business when they crucified Jesus. They repent; they don’t say it to anybody, but they know they missed the greatest business.\nNobody is going to purchase growth or such phony ideas from a Jew. He changed his name into a German name – solid, it makes sense. Then this man started teaching people other things. Once the business started moving he started bringing new commodities in: relationship, friendship, and all kinds of “ships.”\nHe had escaped from his own home, leaving his wife and children, old father, old mother– who were all dependent on him. And he is teaching other people how to relate, how to make your love flower, how to be an authentic individual. But now everything has become known about him, and EST has died.\nIf you become aware of all the religions and what they have done to man, there will be no need to kill them. Just a kick, a good kick, and the pope is gone. They are already dead, they just need a kick; they will fall down of their own accord.\nYou can call that my business. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THE THIRD WORLD WAR? IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT? WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO PREVENT IT?\nDon’t do anything to prevent it, because this humanity that you see around the earth is not worth anything. A good third world war will at least clean this planet of human garbage: cathedrals, temples, mosques, White Houses where only lies are manufactured. Perhaps that’s why it is called the White House – because we know the phrase “white lie.” Lies are always white; they have to be painted white.\nAll these politicians, with no awareness, no love, and with all the nuclear weapons in their hands.… The world right now contains so many nuclear and atomic weapons that this poor humanity can be killed seven times – although that is not needed, once is more than enough. And they go on piling them up.\nBut I am not a pessimist. I am saying it to you just to emphasize the fact that it is not a question of the third world war, it is a question of a change in human consciousness. You cannot prevent the third world war with the same mind as human beings have today – and there is no need either. But human consciousness can be changed.\nYou can become the beginning of a new mankind. And the very newness of your consciousness will be contagious. If sannyasins go on growing around the world as they are growing, there is every possibility there will be no third world war. My sannyasins are not politicians. My sannyasins have no political aspirations; only idiots have those kind of aspirations – chimpanzees and others.\nMy sannyasins are learning to live right now, intensely, totally, burning the torch of life from both ends together. If you can make the people around the world dance and sing and celebrate You\nmay not see the connection between the third world war and what I am saying, but there is a great connection.\nThe third world war is possible only if humanity feels suicidal, if people lose all interest in life and become so frustrated that they don’t want to live – for what? For Ronald Reagan to become the president? For Ethiopia, so that thousands will die every day? For India, which goes on producing children? The Indian woman is continuously pregnant. Half of India is starving; soon it will be a second Ethiopia, far bigger. If you cannot manage Ethiopia, it is impossible to manage India. And the same is going to happen to other third world countries.\nWhat is there to save? – your football matches? the Olympics? What is there in people’s lives? They are living empty, hollow lives. In fact, the third world war is coming closer and closer because people are feeling more and more hollow, without any meaning. They will certainly be happy that the whole world is finished. But if we can create a little joy in people’s lives, a little silence, so that what they think of as hollowness is no longer hollowness; it is serenity, it is silence, it is emptiness, but intensely full, overflowing with joy.…\nI don’t have any dogma, any creed, any cult to spread. I want you to be carriers of joy – in small things. Life does not consist of big things.\nAlexander the Great is just a fool. You have another fool in America – Muhammad Ali the Greatest. There is nothing big in life, because nothing is small either. There is no question of thinking in terms of great, not great. There is no need to think in terms of mundane, spiritual; materialistic, spiritualistic. All these divisions are false. Life is one single whole. It is material, and at the same time it is spiritual. It is mundane, and at the same time the holiest thing possible.\nIf you can become the carriers of my at-ease – that is just the word I have invented against dis-ease\n– if you can do this.… And it is not much, just rejoice in small things: a cup of tea sipping it, feel blessed, because who knows? tomorrow moring you may not be there, the third world war may have happened. When you go to sleep, say goodbye to the stars and to the universe, because who knows at what time Ronald Reagan may go berserk. When you wake up in the morning, greet it. Greet the sun, greet it the way the birds are greeting it with their songs, greet it the way flowers are greeting it by releasing their fragrance.\nDance! Don’t be bothered that you will be thought crazy. Once you are my sannyasins you are crazy. And craziness gives such great freedom that the so-called sane people cannot even understand. You can dance for no reason at all. You can laugh although no joke has been told to you. You can do anything, because you are a recognized crazy man.\nWhy have I given you this red uniform? So it will be recognized: “This man is crazy. He talks to himself, he laughs when there is nothing to laugh at. Watching the sunset, we have seen tears of joy flowing from his eyes.”\nI gave you the mala with my picture to be certain; I don’t want to take any chances. I want you to be\nrecognized in the world as the craziest people around. And slowly you will be surprised: the people\nwho call you crazy will become curious. They also want to laugh, but their mouths are tightly closed by the society. They also want to dance, but their culture does not allow it, or allows it only in certain situations, certain occasions.\nIn my childhood I was very much interested in going to the crematorium. Anybody dying in the city... I was always going. Whether I knew the man or not was not the point. My father asked me, “Are you crazy? That man was a beggar. Why did you go with him and waste your time?”\nI said, “I have become immensely rich going with the people carrying a dead body to the crematorium. I have seen many things which I would not have seen. I have seen that the body they are carrying, and the people who are carrying it, both are dead. It was a shock in the beginning.\n“And I have seen these people The body is on the funeral pyre, and they are sitting around it far\naway – because the fire creates so much heat, particularly in India – talking about film actresses. Somebody is looking at PLAYBOY others are gossiping about people who are not present there, telling all kinds of lies, but nobody is concerned with the person who has died. In fact, whatever they are doing is an effort to create a barrier between them and the burning body. Nobody is thinking that one day their body will be on the funeral pyre and people will be reading PLAYBOY. They don’t want to see it; it is escapism.”\nOne of my teachers died. He was a funny man, very fat, and he used to have a very ancient type of turban – very big, maybe thirty-six feet long or more. Thirty-six feet is normal for the old, ancient turban. His face was also such that you could not remain looking at him without smiling. And he was my Sanskrit teacher.\nHe was a simple man – in fact a simpleton. We had been playing all kinds of tricks on him, and he was never able to find out who had done it; he never punished anybody. We had been really hard on him. He would fall from the chair, because we had managed to cut the legs of the chair before he came. He would fall from the chair, his turban would fall all over the class, and there would be great laughter. But he would start putting his turban back on and writing on the board again, not getting disturbed. He was really a nice fellow.\nHe died. We used to call him Bhole Baba. That was not his name. Baba is simply used for grandfather, a respectful word. Bhole means a simpleton, so innocent that anybody can deceive him. I have completely forgotten his name, because we never used his name; we always used Bhole Baba. I have been trying to figure out what was his real name, but I cannot find it anywhere in my mind.\nWhen I went to his house with my father, his wife came running from inside the house, fell on the chest of that poor fellow, and said, “Oh, my Bhole Baba!” I could not contain my laughter. My father tried telling me, “Keep quiet!”\nI said, “The more I try to keep quiet, the more it is becoming difficult. I cannot contain it; let me laugh!” But everybody was shocked: somebody is dead, and you are laughing so loudly. I said, “Please, don’t be shocked. If you knew the whole thing as I do, you would all be laughing.”\nAnd I told the whole thing, that he was always getting irritated by being called Bhole Baba. And we used to write on the blackboard every day, “Welcome, Bhole Baba”. And the first thing he would do was, he would erase it. And now the poor man was dead and his own wife...\nWhen I told them this, everybody started laughing. And the wife also became silent and said, “It is really strange for me to call him Bhole Baba, because I used to tell that boy not to call him Bhole Baba, that it is not his name.”\nAnd who was the boy? Mostly I was the boy who always going past his house, would knock on the door and say, “Is Bhole Baba inside?” And the wife knew me. With the door closed she would say, “No, he is not inside” – he was always inside – “But remember, don’t call him Bhole Baba! If you stop calling him Bhole Baba, I can open the door and you can find him inside.”\nPerhaps continually hammering, “Bhole Baba, Bhole Baba,” then at the moment of deathOf\ncourse, a Hindu wife is not supposed to say her husband’s name. She cannot, that is thought to be disrespectful – just the male chauvinistic mind. The man can call her by her name, but the woman cannot call her husband by his name. So perhaps... there was no time to figure out what to say; Bhole Baba came in handy.\nBut even the wife started laughing, thinking that this was really hilarious. “My whole life I have been telling you and other boys who are your friends... who you have been telling that whenever they pass the door, they should knock and enquire, ‘Is Bhole Baba inside?’”\nThe death became a laughter. But back home, my father said, “I am not going to take you to another\ndeath, another cremation – not with me, at least. What you have done is not right.”\nI said, “Everybody laughed – even the wife who was crying, started laughing. You should all be\ngrateful to me that I made even death nonserious, fun, a joke.”\nIf my people go on being nonserious, laughing, dancing, singing, not finding any reason for it – life is enough reason for it – we can make the whole world aflame with laughter. Nuclear weapons can be destroyed by a laughing, smiling, dancing humanity. But as humanity is now, there is no hope.\nYou are the only hope! So don’t keep your joy to yourself, spread it, make it available to anybody. Don’t even think whether he is introduced to you or not. Don’t be British, be human! These are the only two kinds in the world.\nThe third world war can be completely stopped – should be stopped. But it is not going to be stopped by the pacifists and their processions and their screaming and shouting for peace. They are not the people to stop it. They are really showing by shouting and screaming that they are not peaceful men. They may be pacifists, but they are ready to fight for it!\nI am not a pacifist, I am at peace.\nI have never participated in any protest of any kind. I have never been a part of any organization of any kind, and I would like you not to be pacifists, but peaceful, radiating your silence around you. It is invisible but it stirs hearts. Radiate your love – not even to your wife, which is the most difficult thing, so I am leaving it for later stages. Radiate your love – not even to your neighbors, that is too difficult. Radiate to strangers.\nStart radiating your being to a tree. Hug it. Have you ever hugged a tree? If you have not hugged a tree you have missed something of grandeur. If in a silent, deep, peaceful moment you hug a tree,\nyou will find it is not a one-sided hug; the tree is responding. And the response is so tangible, that the tree is happy. Dance, and the tree will also rejoice with you; it may become greener, may bring more flowers.\nHave you not watched this happening to this desert, this Big Muddy Ranch? When I came here it was really a sad place: no flowers anywhere, no trees except the juniper. The juniper seems to be German. And those junipers were also very few, not thick, somehow surviving like human beings, at the minimum. Now, after just four years of our being here – and we have not done anything to those junipers – they are greener, thicker, bigger. You can feel their joy.\nWe have changed the desert into an oasis. And soon the whole Muddy Ranch will be green. Your laughter is nourishment even to the trees. There were no birds when I came here, not a single bird. Now birds have started coming. Life is such an organic whole. In my garden there must be nearabout eighty peacocks. Near my house we have made a small river out of rainwater. There are beautiful swans.… Your joy, your love, your peace does something without your knowing to everything that is around you.\nSo I cannot say, “Go and become pacifists. Take the flags and the banners and go to Washington or to Moscow and scream against nuclear weapons.” Nobody is going to hear you. Those politicians are deaf; those politicians are just dodos. That is not going to help. But doing something totally different, which has nothing to do with the third world warThat’s why I said, “Please don’t try to\nprevent it,” because that would be directly making an effort to prevent the third world war. You cannot do it; things have gone too far.\nThe third world war is the conclusion of all the religions and the politicians and all the cultures of the past. It is a logical conclusion. It is only a question of time – and the time, too, is not so much. Things are moving. The way they are moving, before this century ends, the world will be finished.\nBut you can help the world to continue. I am not concerned with the war directly, I am concerned with something else, some other energy as an antidote. Be meditative, be loving, be silent, be sharing – and spread your craziness.\nSoon the same people will start doubting their sanity; you just have to go on spreading your craziness. It takes a little time to hammer the fact, but the so-called sane people will not be incapable of seeing. What is the point of being sane if you cannot love, you cannot dance, you cannot sing, you cannot even whistle? What is the point of being sane? They will say, “Let this sanity go to hell, or to Oregon, but we are no longer going to be sane. We are going to be human, alive, thriving, so full of life that it starts touching others and everyone.”\nAnd you know it by your experience. What I am saying is not giving you a belief, it is your experience too. Just don’t be miserly and hoard it. Remember the law of existence: the more you give, the more you get.\nCHAPTER 23\nPersecution cannot do any harm to you\n2 1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE WAY YOU WALK, IT SEEMS AS IF YOU ARE DRUNK. WHAT IS THE TRUTH?\nMan, I am drunk! But not drunk with ordinary alcohol, marijuana, hashish, opium, LSD. I grow my own marijuana within me. No government can interfere with it. My source of drunkenness is my silence, my love, my centeredness, my rootedness in myself. Yes, I walk like a drunkard because I am a drunkard. You have observed truly.\nOnce you know the inner serenity, a gap between you and your body arises, a gap between you and your mind arises. That creates my bobbily walking. Nothing can be done about it. It is not a medical question, it is natural to anyone who is enlightened.\nMostly enlightened people die immediately after enlightenment, for the simply reason that they cannot manage any connection with their body and mind. It is very rare that somebody goes on living after enlightenment. But one has to compromise.\nThat bobbiling is the compromise. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nMOST PEOPLE, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, EQUATE DEMOCRACY WITH THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEIR POLITICIANS, YET YOU SEEM TO ENVISAGE A COUNTRY WHICH IS BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND POLLUTION-FREE, BECAUSE YOU SEE POLITICIANS AS POLLUTION. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nJust the very existence of nations, countries dividing humanity into stupid parts, is the whole game of the politician. And this I call pollution. It is poison to humanity. That’s why you don’t see really authentically alive people in the world.\nYou are asking, “People generally understand democracy to mean the freedom to choose politicians.” Do you see the idiotic understanding of the people? It is choosing between poisons. The bottles contain the same poison – on one is written “Democratic,” on another is written “Republican.”\nPoliticians have been befooling you. They have managed the whole strategy in such a way that you never become aware what is happening. You choose one kind of poison for five years; for those five years you have to suffer that poison. After five years you are fed up with this kind of poison. You change to another bottle – Republican, Liberal, Democratic, Communist, Socialist. They are all available in all shapes and sizes, whatsoever suits you. But you will fall in the same ditch. Maybe there are minor differences between poisons, but poison is poison.\nI do not see democracy as the freedom to choose between the politicians. To me, democracy means there are no longer any politicians around. You individually choose somebody you feel is the right person; there are no political parties. In a real democracy, political parties cannot exist; there is no reason why they should exist. People are intelligent enough to choose on their own. The politician need not go and convince the people, “I am the right person and the other is wrong.” And the other is also doing the same, and the poor people in their utter confusion somehow choose somebody.\nI have never voted in my life, for the simple reason that all those politicians and political parties are basically the same. They want to exploit you, oppress you. And it is a good strategy that after five years when you get fed up with one party, you can choose another.\nPeople’s memory is not very strong. So for five years it is the Republican party sucking you, doing everything that is wrong, deceiving you and the whole world. After five years, it is the Democratic party doing the same thing behind a different label. And when for five years the Democratic party is ruling, you get fed up with them, and you forget completely that those Republicans had done the same before. Five years is enough time for people to forget. And you go on moving between two parties.\nThere may be more parties in other countries, but basically two parties are in a deep conspiracy against the people: “Five years we exploit them, then we will give you five years to exploit them. And again we will come back.”\nIn a real democracy what is the need of political parties? The real need is to make people more alert, more intelligent, so they can choose individually, not impressed by propaganda.\nAnd what small things impress you! Why was Nixon defeated by Kennedy? You will be surprised and shocked, because it will prove to you how idiotic you are: It was the television that made the\nwhole difference. On television, the supporters, the advisors of Nixon, had insisted that he wear dark clothes “so your figure comes out clearly, strongly, because millions of people will never see you in person; they will only see you on the television.”\nNixon did not listen to them. He came in a gray suit, and that decided his defeat. Kennedy came in a dark, black suit. When they were together you saw that Nixon looked gray, weak, while Kennedy looked clear, strong.\nTelevision has changed almost the whole political phenomenon. Before television, you were coming in contact with the real person. Now when you come in contact with a person, experts have decided his hairstyle, make-up, the color of his clothes. They have taught him how to walk, how to stand, how to look exactly into the eyes of the people; what to say, how to say it, when to make a gesture with his hand; when to almost shout, and when to almost whisper. Now it is in the hands of the experts to program him.\nNixon was not ready for it, and I think any man who has any sense of integrity will not agree to all this nonsense. He is not an actor. But Kennedy followed the advice of the advisors. He came on the television very strong, very clear, standing the way a strong person stands, speaking the way a strong person speaks. He was chosen. It has nothing to do with politics – just two poison bottles, but one has a beautiful container, more modern. The other is an old container, out-of-date.\nNixon looked lousy on the television. That decided his fate, and also made him learn that television has changed the whole situation. The next time he came like an actor, played his role well, and was chosen. And he proved to you that he was a poison.\nIt is very strange, nobody assassinated Nixon. Kennedy was assassinated. Then his brother, another Kennedy, was assassinated because he was also fighting to become the president of the country. And now the third brother, the last brother, is being threatened: if he tries to become the president, he will be gone the same way the two others have gone. You call this country democratic?\nYes, in the constitution it may be written that everybody has the right to run for any office, but the third Kennedy is being threatened, and he knows that the people who are threatening him mean business. His mother is very old – ninety years old; he had to listen to her. She has suffered her whole life. She has lost two of her sons and she does not want to lose the last one; otherwise the whole family tree will be destroyed. She has taken a promise from the third Kennedy that while she is living he will not run for president.\nIs this politics or mafia? Is this democracy? It is not. The only difference between a communist country like Russia, and America, is superficial. In Russia, one party rules forever. In America, they give you a chance to choose which political party you want to be exploited by. But what is the difference? – you are going to be exploited. The exploiters go on changing, but the exploitation remains the same. What does it matter? One party exploits you forever, or two parties make a pact and in rotation they exploit you? But your exploitation is the same.\nMy concept of democracy is people deciding on their own, without any political propaganda from anybody. Choose the candidates you like. In fact, the candidate approaching the people and asking, “Please choose me,” is ugly, disgusting. If he is of any worth, people should reach him and ask him, “Please take this responsibility for us. We want you to be in the parliament.”\nThen a different quality of people will be coming into the assemblies and the parliament, people who will not have any political leadership of the party, its program. They will be free individuals acting out of their intelligence. They can choose the president, the prime minister – anybody. And they will be deciding on every issue according to themselves. People have given them immense respect by sending them to the government; they cannot be exploiters.\nA real democracy will choose the wise people. They are all around. But remember, a man of wisdom is not going to beg you for a vote. He is not going to kiss your children and shake hands with you. He is not going to act on the television screen so that he appears to be the way you would like your president to be.\nThe wise man is not interested – in fact, he will not be inclined to be dragged into this mess. You will have to persuade him. The whole scene changes – not the politician persuading you, but you persuading someone to represent you. More fresh blood will be coming into the government.\nAnd secondly, democracy can exist only if the countries are dissolved. With so many countries preparing to fight with each other continuously, of course you choose the most cunning politician you can, because he will be safer. You want him to be smarter, more cunning than the Soviet premier. The same is the situation in every country.\nThe wise people remain out of politics. It is so dirty, stinkingly dirty. And it will remain dirty till nations dissolve and we have one world where there is no question of any war, no question of preparing for war.\nYou can divide history in two parts: one, when people are really fighting, killing, burning people – innocent people who have not done anything wrong to you. In fact, you don’t know whom you are killing. Or the second part of history, when you are preparing for the next war. Of course, a little time is needed between two wars, and if the wars are going to be world wars, then at least ten or fifteen years’ gap is needed.\nNow we are on the verge of a third world war. Albert Einstein was asked once, “Can you say something about the third world war?” He said, “No, but I can say something about the fourth world war.”\nThe questioner was simply surprised. He said, “If you cannot say anything about the third, what can you say about the fourth?”\nHe said, “The fourth is not going to happen.”\nThe third world war is going to finish all living beings: men, birds, animals, trees – anything that is alive it is going to be destroyed completely. And your politicians are preparing for it.\nThe world needs to be free from politicians, only then can it be free from pollution.\nWhat is the need for nations? Why can’t we have the right to move freely around the earth? This is our earth! Now I have been here for four years, and I am still a tourist. It seems I am going to die as a tourist. The government agencies who are responsible for deciding are in a difficulty. If they say\nno to me, I am going to fight the courts up to the Supreme Court. That will give me enough time – almost twenty years. So they are afraid to say no. Yes, of course, they cannot say. So they are in a dilemma, just waiting for some miracle to happen. But I am not a miracle man!\nBut who are these men to decide? They are also foreigners, America is not their country. Perhaps they came four generations ago and I came a little later, just four years ago. But they are invaders – I am not an invader. I have come to the country as a friend.\nMan should have a birthright of free movement around the earth, and one day a birthright to move around the stars. We have to dissolve all the boundaries and all the nonsense that exists because of these boundaries. Anybody who divides man, for any excuse, is unforgivable. Black and white And\nwhat about me? – neither black nor white.\nIn India, we have a beautiful joke.… When God created man – of course he was an amateur, he had never created before – so when he put the man made of mud into the oven, he pulled Him out a little too soon. These are the white men, uncooked. And it is natural – because he saw that this is an uncooked man, next time he waited a little longer, went to the other extreme, and when he pulled the man out, he found a Negro. He said, “This is going to be a difficult job.” So he decided on a time exactly in the middle. That’s why there are people like me neither uncooked nor cooked too much.\nBut what difference does color make? What difference does sex make? Why should woman be treated differently than man?\nIn China, for centuries it was thought that the woman has no soul. Great thinkers! Great discoverers! They have not bothered about themselves, whether they have any soul or not, but they decided unanimously that the woman has none. She is a thing to be possessed. Therefore, for centuries in China if a husband killed the wife it was not murder, it was not something against the law. You could not drag the man to the court as a murderer, because the idea was that the woman was a thing. If you destroy your chair it is your business, if you want to put your house on fire, it is your house. The wife belongs to you, you can do anything to the wife.\nAnd they did everything to the woman. From her very childhood the Chinese girl was given iron shoes, so that her feet remained very small. That was their idea of beauty. In fact, they crippled the woman. Of course, her body want on growing, but her feet remained small. They thought they looked very dainty – they were simply out of proportion. The feet should grow in proportion to the body, because they have to take the whole load of the body. It was difficult for the Chinese woman to dance or to walk properly.\nAll kinds of ugly things around the world just because one is man, another is woman. And what is\nthe difference between a Christian and a Jew and a Hindu and a Mohammedan? Just their conditionings are different; otherwise, they are exactly the same people. But they have been labeled by their conditioning as Jews, as Christians, as Mohammedans. You are not a thing. You should refuse to be labeled.\nMan has to rebel against all these stupidities, because stupidities have divided the world. And divided, naturally everybody is afraid of everybody else. Your neighbor starts doing gymnastics; you get paranoid. Why is this man trying to become stronger? – you join a gymnastics course\nimmediately. Seeing you – that you are going for a gymnastics program, you have joined the gym –\nthe neighbor becomes afraid. He starts making better efforts, because it is going to be a tough fight.\nAnd this is happening around the world. In Pakistan they have American soldiers. Now, it is absolutely natural for India to invite Soviet soldiers. The American politicians say, “Expel Soviet soldiers from India, remove them; then we will remove the American soldiers from Pakistan.” But who is going to remove them first? Both say, “You remove them first, because we don’t want to take the risk.” Nobody is removing soldiers, nobody wants to remove them.\nIf you look clearly, the way I seeBecause I am nobody; I don’t belong to any nation, I don’t belong\nto any religion, I don’t belong to any political party. I am simply an individual, the way existence created me. I have kept myself absolutely uninfluenced by any idiotic ideology – religious, political, social, financial. And the miracle is that because I am not burdened with all these glasses on my eyes, and curtains before me, I can see clearly.\nThe world can be a paradise any moment it decides! It will just have to drop a little crap: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, American, Russian. Politicians will not help you to do it, they will hinder you from doing it. Priests will not help you to do it, they will hinder you from doing it. All their greatness – the president of America, the premier of the Soviet Union, the infallible pope in the Vatican what\nwill happen to these people?\nIf you drop all your conditionings, and if you remove all the lines from the map, you burn all your identity cards, your passports, your visas, and you start moving around the world absolutely freely – it is our world – what will happen to these idiots who are sitting on your head? They will create every difficulty.\nBut the time has come to face the fact; otherwise, you are on the very verge of a total global war which will destroy everybody. Before that happens, get free of all poisons – nations, politicians, priests, religions – and the world will be pollution-free.\nIt is not the ordinary pollution that exists in L.A.; that is nothing. That too exists because of vested interests. A car can be created which does not pollute the air, but what will happen to all the manufacturers of hundreds of cars around the world? Their factories will go bankrupt. Right now they are billionaires; they will be beggars immediately.\nYou may not know that many inventions which are going to help humanity are prevented; their copyright is purchased by somebody whose vested interest will be interfered with. And the poor scientist, if he gets enough money, how can he refuse? There are hundreds of inventions which have been prevented. Money has been paid, and humanity goes on suffering.\nMan has to declare his freedom. it is not a question of a nation being free, it is a question of every individual on the earth being free from all the jargon that the past has left within you.\nThe cars pollute the air but the politicians and the priests pollute your very soul.\nThe air can be cleaned, the cars can be changed. If man is capable of reaching to the moon I\ndon’t see why the scientists who can reach to the moon cannot make a fountain pen which does not\nleak! It seems simply absurd. Man has come to a maturity, and now decisions have to be made by free individuals – not Americans, not Russians, not Indians. We can make this earth pollution-free, outwardly and inwardly.\nThat’s my message to my sannyasins: First, be free, and then let others taste your freedom and the joy it brings with it. It is not a difficult job at all. People are waiting for some savior to come and deliver them from all this misery. The savior is not going to come, but half of their waiting is right: they are waiting to be transformed. If they go on waiting for the savior they are waiting for Godot, who has never come, who will never come. They have to drop this idea that tomorrow somebody is going to come and deliver them from their suffering, misery. No, it is not going to happen.\nYou have to become the savior of yourself.\nI teach selfishness, because to me to be selfish is not wrong, it is natural. Everybody should be selfish, self-centered, not waiting for anybody’s help. Declare your freedom individually. And that’s my movement. You are here, not as a society, not as a community, you are here as an individual. There is nothing higher than an individual and his freedom.\nJust be a little courageous. And to suffer for freedom is not suffering, it is a joy. To suffer for individuality is not painful; it is a pleasure, because you are moving towards a blissful state. Just a little courageousness – I don’t ask you for great courage. Just a little courage, and the world can be free of politics and pollution. The world can be free of fights, murder, massacre, burning people alive.…\nIf you look at history, it is so ugly. In my university, one day I went into the history department. I was looking around and getting introduced to all the subjects, so I could choose. And that was my last day too, because immediately I was fighting with my professor. I told him, “If this is history that you are teaching, then don’t poison people’s minds. It is better they forget all about the past. Don’t go on pouring rubbish into their heads, because then there will be no space for the present and no space for the future.” There is no need of history. All history is bunk!\nIt can happen in a single moment of understanding. That is the only miracle I know. All other miracles are inventions or gullible people, of stupid followers, of cunning scholars. But one miracle is part of nature.\nIf you see something clearly, then don’t wait for the next moment. Do it right now, drop all nonsense.\nAnd you will see the birth of a new man in you. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI HEARD YOU SAY THAT MOSES WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS, BECAUSE HE CREATED THE CONCEPT OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE. WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE JEWS AND US? I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSES AND YOU, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PHENOMENON OF A RISING ANGER AND HATE IN THE OUTSIDE SOCIETY? ARE WE, OR YOU, RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR PERSECUTION?\nBaby, you don’t know the difference between me and Moses. If you had that much intelligence there would have been no question at all. What do you know about Moses? And what do you know about me? What difference do you know?\nMoses was a politician, not a prophet. He was taking his people from slavery to find a new land where they could live without slavery. But to convince slaves that you can be free is difficult; hence, he invented all kinds of incentives: “It is God’s wish,” and, “I have spoken with God face to face, and he has said to me that the Jews are the chosen people, my people.”\nStrange, God’s people were slaves for centuries, making pyramids in Egypt. What was this God doing all the time? His chosen people were being murdered mercilessly, continuously beaten. It is now a well-established fact that the pyramids are made of such big stones that unless there were better cranes than we have, there was no possibility of lifting them. How did they manage to move those big stones, going higher and higher into the sky?\nThey were not managed by cranes, they were managed by “God’s chosen people,” followed by the Egyptians with their whips, on their horses, continuously whipping the people who were carrying the stone. And when somebody has to choose between death and life, he is ready to do anything. What was God doing all this time before Moses? It seems that the post reaches God after thousands of years – a very inefficient postal service. It must be managed by Indians – so lousy, so lazy.…\nI lived in Jabalpur for many years. Katni is a small place eighty miles away from Jabalpur. One letter came from Katni to Jabalpur in thirty-six years! Even if the envelope had walked, it would have come long before. By the time it reached Jabalpur, the man to whom the letter was written was dead. So it was returned to the sender, but by that time the sender was dead! But the postal service between God’s chosen people and God seems to be even more lousy.\nThere is nothing in this whole idea of the chosen people of God. Everybody is chosen; otherwise you would not be here. Everybody – not only man, but animals and birds and trees – is chosen by existence; otherwise, there is no reason why they should be there. They are, because existence wants them, needs them.\nMoses bluffed those poor slaves. And it is very easy. When you say to a poor man, “You will be rewarded immensely after death, it is just a question of a few years. Be patient and these rich people who are enjoying here only for a few days will suffer in hell for eternity,” he does not argue, it is so consoling.\nWhen Moses said to the Jews, “You are the chosen people of God,” they accepted it without any argument. I have not heard anybody arguing with Moses: “On what grounds are you saying we are the chosen people of God? Then why did we suffer for thousands of years? Why were our women raped by the Egyptians? Why were our people killed by the Egyptians? And why has God given only one work to His chosen people?” – to carry huge stones, almost an inhuman job. If this is what it means to be chosen by God, they should have refused; “We don’t want to be chosen. Now choose somebody else!”\nBut poor people – slaves, hungry, starving – don’t argue; they want consolation. They were immensely happy. They did not ask, “What evidence do you have that you encountered God?\nWas there any eyewitness? What proof have you got that these ten commandments that you are bringing from God are written by God and not by you? because they are in Hebrew. Is Hebrew also the chosen language of God, amongst three hundred languages in the world?”\nNobody argued. In such a position nobody argues; people simply swallow it with relish. They followed Moses out of Egypt – but soon they became worried, because their leader seemed to be as lost as they were, in the vast desert of the Middle East. But leaders have to go on pretending that they know what they are doing: “You simply believe us, you follow us.”\nIt took Moses forty years to reach a place, Israel – which is not much of a place. If he had encountered God himself, if he had had that clarity of consciousness, he should have moved just in the opposite direction, towards Kashmir – which can be called a paradise on earth. But Israel and the whole surrounding area is just desert. If he had had any insight and the extraordinary powers of a prophet, he would have chosen the countries which have oil – Israel has no oil. Then perhaps Jews would have been the richest people in the world, just as Saudi Arabians are today. And Saudi Arabia he had by-passed.\nWhat do you know about Moses? He was lying, purely lying to his people, pretending that he knew where the holy land was. And why did he stop at Israel? Had he found the holy land? No, but he was getting old, his people were dying of starvation, dehydration – no water, no food. Only one-third of the people survived; two-thirds had already died in this search for the holy land.\nAnd the one-third that survived were almost of a different generation. There was a great gap between these people and Moses. These were small children when the journey started, the search for the holy land. They had no idea of the slavery of Egypt, they had no idea what had been happening to their race for centuries, they had no idea whether this Moses had really encountered God or was just a pretender.\nThe new generation and the generation gap begins with Moses and the Jews. You will be surprised to know that Moses felt so frustrated that he himself escaped from Jerusalem. Of course, he found an excuse. He said, “One of our tribes is lost somewhere in the desert, and I have to find them.”\nIt was true. A few of the Jews, seeing the situation, had turned in the other direction – that is natural logic: “If this direction goes on and on into desert, perhaps going in the opposite direction we may find good land.” And these are the people who live in Kashmir now. They are Jewish, forcibly converted by Mohammedans to follow Mohammedanism. Moses finally reached Kashmir. He was very ancient at that time; he could not live much longer, and he died in Kashmir in India.\nA great coincidence: Moses died in India, Jesus died in India, Buddha died in India, Mahavira died in India, Krishna died in India. The founders of almost all the great religions of the world were either born in India or at least managed to die in India. Just to disconnect myself from all that rotten lot, I left India. It was not in my hands not to be born there, but it is in my hands to be assassinated in Oregon.\nWhat do you know about Moses? And what do you know about me? You know nothing, so please be clear about it. Yes, your question is relevant. Moses is responsible for the persecution of Jews down the centuries, because he declared them to be, and convinced them that they are, the chosen\npeople of God, that they are born higher than anybody else; all human beings are lower than them, they are a superior race. Or course, the implication is clear: they are here to rule, not to be ruled. They are here to dominate the whole world, and not to be dominated.\nThis idea made them fanatics, and naturally, anybody claiming superiority over everybody else creates persecution. They have been persecuted down the ages; they are still being persecuted. Moses is responsible. He implanted that idea, and these poor people have carried that idea for three thousand years. It is very difficult for them to drop it. The Jewish nose keeps itself higher than that of anybody else.\nYou are asking me: if my people are going to be persecuted, who is going to be responsible – I or they? My whole effort is that whatsoever I am doing I am responsible for. If I am persecuted and assassinated, I am responsible for it. But if you are persecuted and assassinated, remember, it is your responsibility, not mine. Why in the first place did you join me? I will not allow you to shirk away from your responsibility. I will not take your responsibility on myself.\nI am responsible for whatsoever I am doing, and whatsoever happens to me. You are responsible individually – because I don’t believe in any collectivity. Every individual has to accept his responsibility for whatsoever he is doing, whatsoever happens to him.\nI had started alone. Then people started coming by and by, and my caravan started becoming bigger and bigger, and now it is all around the earth. But those people I respect. They have joined me on their own decision; I have not persuaded anybody.\nI have not given you any promises of a holy land. I have not given you any incentives after death. I have not given you any guarantee that if you are with me, soon you will be with God. I don’t give you promissory notes, and I don’t take any responsibility on your behalf, because I respect you. If I take the responsibility on myself, then you are slaves; then I am the leader and you are the led.\nNo, I am not the leader, and you are not the led. We are fellow travelers. You are not behind me but by my side – just together with me. I am not higher than you, I am just one amongst you. I don’t claim any superiority, extraordinary power, and all kinds of nonsense which Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, all are to be condemned for. Do you see the point? To make you responsible for your life is to give you freedom.\nA few of the sannyasins – for trivia, absurd reasons – have left the caravan. I am not at all angry with them. They had joined; it was their responsibility. They have left; it is their responsibility. If they want to come back, it will be their responsibility.\nEvery single sannyasin is responsible, remember. You cannot dump your responsibility on me. I am simply taking my own doings, sayings, happenings on myself. If you feel that because of me you are persecuted, drop sannyas. Why should you be persecuted for me? Who am I?\nBut if your sannyas is your love affair with me, then take the responsibility: be persecuted. And persecution cannot do any harm to you, for the simple reason that we are not fanatics, we are not dogmatic. My people are open, vulnerable, available.\nSome Jesus freaks come on the county road to save my people. They take real trouble coming down to save my people, and nobody listens to them. Or, if sometimes somebody stands there, he simply laughs and walks away. This is a new experience for those people. Either people start arguing with them or agreeing with them. They know those two kinds: arguing, agreeing.\nThis is a different kind of species: they listen, they laugh and go on their way. The reason is obvious: you cannot save somebody who is already saved. Saving somebody twice is not possible – that’s why they simply laugh at the whole absurdity of the idea. But remember, I have not saved you. I am very clear about it: if you are saved, you are your own savior, and persecution cannot destroy you.\nPersecution is going to happen; it is already happening. But you are intelligent people; you can fight the persecution through legal means in the courts, in the Supreme Court. I have given you no dogma, nobody can criticize you – and I have made you capable of criticizing everybody else in the world. So what can persecution do to you? Anybody who comes to persecute you is going to become a sannyasin! Let them come.\nThey are very much afraid even to visit the commune. They are continuously talking about the commune, they are continuously talking about me – knowing nothing, just gathering things from gossips. But their interest is clear. Why don’t they come here? They don’t have guts – particularly the Americans don’t have any guts. It happens when you are rich enough and you have all the comforts of life: you start losing guts because you become afraid – anything can take you away from your comforts and your television.\nAnd there are rumors about me that I am hypnotizing people. When I used to go driving on the highways, sometimes I was stopped by a police car, but the police officer would not look directly into my eyes – afraid of getting hypnotized!\nNobody is hypnotizing anybody here. In fact, we have a program of dehypnosis, which exists nowhere else in the world. We are teaching our people how to dehypnotize themselves – because the society has hypnotized you already. What is your Christianity? What is your being American? What is the reason for your being a Hindu?\nSociety starts hypnotizing you when you are a child and you don’t know what is happening. By the time you are adult, you are already full of bullshit. Now you go on carrying that bullshit as treasure. You are afraid if you lose this bullshit, you will find emptiness within – something is better than nothing. And you have become accustomed to the smell of the bullshit; perhaps not only accustomed, but enchanted.\nI have heard about a fisherman’s wife who used to come from her village to the nearby, bigger town, to sell fish. One day after selling the fish, when she was returning back home, she met one woman, a childhood friend. The woman said, “We have just moved to this town and it will be a great joy if you spend the night with us, and in the morning you can go.”The house was beautiful, with a big garden around it, beautiful flowers and their fragrance. The woman’s friend did everything to please the guest. She put roses around her bed – the whole room was full of rose fragrance. But the woman was tossing and turning; she could not sleep.\nFinally, the host asked the guest, “What is the matter? Is there some problem? Is something\nuncomfortable? As far as I see, I have made everything as comfortable as possible. But tell me, because I don’t want you to remain awake the whole night.”\nThe woman was a little ashamed in answering the host. She said, “Please forgive me. Just give me back the clothes and the bucket in which I had brought the fish; unless I smell fishes I cannot sleep. And please remove these roses, they are such a disturbance.”\nThe roses were removed, her bucket and clothes were given back to her. She kept the bucket by her side, made the clothes damp with water, put those clothes on her face – and then she was fast asleep, snoring. Fish have a disgusting smell, but not to the fisherman. He knows nothing better than the smell of fish.\nIt is difficult for you to drop everything that the past has given to you and just be free. And then you will see that everything you do, and everything that is being done to you is your responsibility. You will never dump things on others – that is childish; that is the way of the retarded.\nJust the other day in the World Press Conference, I could not communicate with only two people, they were from Africa. The first one could not manage to say what he wanted to ask me. Somehow it was figured out what he was asking. He was asking why Africans don’t come to me. Now, is it my responsibility? Is it my business, my concern why Africans don’t come to me? Ask the Africans!\nThey know only the smell of fish; roses are not going to satisfy them. And I am offering roses to you, so only those who can understand the fragrance of roses can be here with me. I am offering you the best of everything.\nThe people who can understand Mozart’s music or Wagner’s music, the people who can understand Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, the people who can understand the beautiful poetry of Rabindranath, Khalil Gibran, the people who can understand Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, Gorky, and can find the beauty, the truth in these people – they can understand me. Then there is a possibility of communication. I was not wanting to be rude to the poor African, but this is the truth, the naked truth.\nIt was happening in India too. We had become an island; people from all over the world were coming there – except the Indians. Strange, but not really: Indians cannot understand anything which is so superior, so delicate. In two thousand years of slavery, they have forgotten all. In two thousand years of slavery, they have learned only how to polish the boots of the British, of the Moguls. Now these boot-shiners cannot communicate with me. Yes, they can hear what I say, but they will not understand it.\nThis happened with the second African. He asked the question, and he was looking all over the place. I was answering his question in front of him, and he was not looking at me. Poverty, no education... Africa is far behind. The gap is big.\nWhen I was answering his question, he was looking all around, finding himself in an awkward situation, because what I was saying was beyond his grasp. And the moment I stopped answering the first question, he immediately came up with a second question. Perhaps while I was answering his first question he was thinking and preparing the second question. He was not listening to me,\nbecause the second question was not connected with the first question at all. The second question was not connected with my answer at all.\nIf he had listened to me, he would have asked something in response to my answer. But he must have crammed two questions, and he must have been trying to keep remembering what he was going to ask next. And he did not want to be disturbed by my answer! If he gets interested in my answer, he may forget the second question. Now, what can I do if Africans don’t come? It is their responsibility.\nScientists now have agreed on the fact that man was born in Africa. Naturally, Africa has the biggest chimpanzees, monkeys; only those chimpanzees and monkeys can turn into men. Indian monkeys are too small, they won’t do. Man was born in Africa – but why is Africa so backward? It is not only that their skin is black – because black skin has its own beauty, as white skin has its own beauty. More important is that they are living in darkness, in a total, black night. What has happened?\nThe intelligent people.… If man was born in Africa, the intelligent people left Africa thousands of years ago, because it was not a land worth living in. And the intelligent man is always searching for something better, so the man of intelligence left Africa. Only the retarded who were still very close to the chimpanzees remained there.\nI am not condemning, I have all compassion for them. I would like them to come up and be equal to the whole humanity. But what can I do except tell it to them? They have to take the responsibility on their own shoulders. And the backward people are the last to accept responsibility.\nYour question makes you a confirmed retarded person. Drop thinking such questions. Without responsibility you are not a real human being. Come of age, grow up. And remember always, growing old is not growing up. Even donkeys grow old, but they don’t grow up. Only man has the prerogative, the privilege of growing up. Become more conscious, more alert, more meditative, more silent, and you will see what I am saying.\nEverybody is responsible for himself. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSINCE YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AGAIN THIS TIME, MANY OF US FEEL THAT YOU ARE TAKING US INTO ANOTHER PHASE OF YOUR WORK. IS THIS TRUE?\nAbsolutely true. I had to give a three year gap and remain silent for so many reasons.\nOne of the reasons relevant to your question is that I had been speaking on Jesus, on Krishna, on Buddha, on Mahavira. I was speaking on all other traditions of religion: Hassidism, Zen, Sufism. I had spoken on almost all important people who had contributed something to human consciousness: Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Bodhidharma, Bokuju, Socrates, Pythagoras, Zarathustra, Kabir, Shankara, Dadu, Milarepa, Marpa Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu. I covered almost the whole world. Wherever I found a man who has contributed to human consciousness, whether it was Greece –\nHeraclitus, Diogenes, Dionysius – or it was Tibet, or it was China, or it was Arabia, it did not matter to me.\nI was speaking on these people for a certain reason, a simple device. I had no people of my own. I had to throw my net far and wide. When I spoke on Jesus, Christians were happy, immensely happy; they started coming to me. Even priests, bishops, became sannyasins.\nAnd I was laughing all the time inside, that what I was saying was my own, it had nothing to do with Jesus; Jesus was just an excuse. I used his words, but put my meaning into them. And those people were thinking, “We have never understood Jesus rightly, we were thinking something else.” In fact, they were right; I was changing the wine, keeping the bottle.\nAnd when I had enough people who were capable of listening to me directly, and I didn’t have to drop things which are ugly in Jesus, ugly in Mahavira, ugly in Mohammed... because in the beginning I was not in the position to offend these people. To offend these people in the beginning would have been a disaster: you would not have been here, I would not have been here.\nSo I used those devices, and then I stopped speaking just to give a gap – so that those who are only interested in me because I speak on Jesus will leave. Those who think that I am supporting Hinduism by speaking on the GITA will leave – because silence is not a discourse on the GITA.\nThis was a beautiful experience. A few people left, just enough to be counted on your fingers. But more than half a million people are now ready to listen to me. Now I don’t care. I can call Jesus just what he is: a crackpot. I can call Mahavira just exactly what he is: a masochist. Now I know that you can understand me.\nIt was a preparatory period. I was not thinking that I was going to catch so many fish, but truth has its own mysterious ways. I have with me, with great love, trust, friendliness, more than half a million sannyasins. But that is not the whole number who are getting close to me. There are at least two million people who are in great sympathy with what I am saying, but they don’t yet have courage enough to come out and declare, “I have dropped the past and I am ready for the present.”\nAnd there are at least one million people who are just fifty-fifty: they read my books, they go to church too. I know that if they go on continuing to read my books – particularly now that I am creating the new BIBLE and THE LAST TESTAMENT You have heard about the Old Testament\nand the New Testament; I am creating THE LAST TESTAMENT. If they go on reading what I am saying now, things will be settled. Either they will burn my books and take shelter in a church, or they will burn the Old Testament and the New Testament and be my people.\nRight now they are in a split. But I don’t see how any intelligent person can choose – if he understands me – anything two thousand years old, three thousand years old, five thousand years old, unless he is a junk collector.\nYes, it is totally a new phase, because I have found my people and now I can open my heart totally. Now all the cards are open on the table!\nI have nothing to hide from you, because I know your love will be able to understand it.\nCHAPTER 24\nGo to your bathroom dancing\n22 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT CELIBATE, I WAS SHOCKED. I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU HAD TRANSCENDED SEX. WHY DID THIS DISTURB ME?\nI was also shocked, because I was thinking you all would be shocked and only one camel got the shock. But his question is meaningful.\nYou were shocked, Mr. Camel, because you had certain expectations of me. It is strange – I don’t expect anything from you, and you go on expecting how I should be, what I should do, what I should not. I am giving you total freedom, and you want me to be a prisoner of your expectations?\nYou were shocked because of the long, ancient tradition of a very surprising phenomenon: masters have been imposing their ideas on their disciples; in return the disciples were imposing their ideas on the masters. And it was not that the master was really a master – because he followed his own followers, he fulfilled their expectations.\nIf he does not fulfill their expectations all his respectability is gone, the followers will disperse. In fact, the same people who had respected him like a god will treat him like a dog. He will be condemned and cursed. And your old so-called masters were not courageous enough to remain free. What could they give you? They were imprisoned by you.\nYou both were doing the same thing. The follower was fulfilling the master’s ideas; otherwise he would be condemned – that is clear. The other thing is a little more subtle: the followers had certain criteria, expectations, and their so-called masters – they don’t deserve even to be called “so-called” masters – were fulfilling their expectations for centuries; it was a mutual slavery. That’s why you were shocked. It has nothing to do with my celibacy or my love. It has something to do with your rotten mind.\nWho are you to expect anything from me? We have no contract, no bargain.\nYou are here out of your own freedom, I am here out of my own freedom. Freedom is the only bridge between us. I don’t expect anything from you, still, what stupidity... you expect anything from me? I should follow your idea of enlightenment? Are you enlightened? An enlightened man should follow the idea of the unenlightened, how he has to behave? Do you see the absurdity of it? But the follower’s ego is fulfilled: his master is celibate, his master is this, that.…\nEvery religion has created different kinds of expectations. The Jaina master has to remain naked, only then will Jainas recognize him as enlightened. I don’t see any relationship between nakedness and enlightenment. Do you see any relationship?\nThe Buddhists will not allow Gautam Buddha to touch a woman, to hold her hand and have a little dance with her, because the enlightened man does not touch a woman. In fact, he is expected not even to see a woman. The buddhist master walks looking only four feet ahead of him, so that his eyes are glued to the earth. At the most he may be able to see the feet of a woman, but not the face.\nThe Hindus have their expectation. The Hindu master is not supposed even to sit on the place where a woman has been sitting before. Even that part of the earth has become dangerous, because the woman has left her vibrations there, and those vibrations can destroy his celibacy.\nAll these people were fulfilling the desires of their followers. I don’t care a bit what you expect; that is your problem. I am going to shatter all your expectations of me. I am totally a free man. I don’t care even about whether you think me enlightened or not. I am, why should I care?\nWhen I became enlightened I also had the idea, which has been there for centuries, that after enlightenment one transcends sex. So for a few days I waited for the transcendence. It was not coming; on the contrary, the grass was greener. The women were more beautiful than ever before, because my eyes were clear.\nIt has been traditionally understood that if an enlightened man makes love to a woman, his enlightenment is finished. So I was a little hesitant. But then I thought that if enlightenment is such a weak thing, it is not worth having. How can making love to a woman destroy enlightenment? And if it does destroy it, that means the love between a man and a woman is a far bigger, stronger and more vital force than your bogus so-called enlightenment.\nAnd I am always attracted towards the unknown, untried, unexplored. I said to myself, “For five\nthousand years the enlightened people have perpetuated the idea. I have to experiment and to see.”\nAnd I have loved many women – my enlightenment has not changed. I have created a historical event! In the future, no enlightened man should be expected to be celibate. I have risked much. But in a way, after enlightenment something is transcended – it is not sex, but sexuality. After enlightenment I have not been able to look into the eyes of any woman with sexuality.\nIt is nothing on my part, I cannot take the credit for it. The whole experience of enlightenment has changed many things. Even making love to a woman is now totally different, absolutely different, has no connection with the love when I was unenlightened. It was not love, it was just a biological, chemical, hormonal attraction. It was just a kind of slavery; it was a need, and you were possessed by the need. That need has disappeared. Now making love to a woman is just pure fun – and I have never heard that after enlightenment fun is transcended.\nIn fact, only after enlightenment can you love. Before that you were just animals, camels. Have you seen two animals making love? Watch carefully – you will be surprised. They both look so sad, so depressed. A clear perception is there that they are feeling the bondage of biology, they are feeling the slavery of biology. Animals don’t enjoy making love. They have to do it; it is something that they cannot avoid – they are not conscious enough. When the season comes, they have to mate.\nMan, even though unenlightened, has changed one thing: there is no season for mating for him, the whole year he is free to love. A certain freedom has come to humanity which is not available to the animals.\nIt is very strange to see animals: for one month or two months they become attracted to each other and then for ten months they are celibate; for ten months they remain enlightened! Just for two months those poor guys, under the impact of biological forces, have to make love. It is almost as if somebody is holding a gun behind you and telling you to make love. The biological gun is not visible, but it is very powerful. How can you enjoy? How can you be blissful?\nNo animal is happy making love. Only man has risen a little higher, and that height has made him capable of being freed from one thing: the biological period of mating. But still, it is biology that goes on forcing him to make love all the year round.\nIn the East, people make love only in the night. In the West, they have a little more intelligence, they make love early in the morning – of course they also make love in the night. The western mind has grown a little more towards freedom. Why make love in darkness? The reason was always because making love was a kind of enforcement, and the faces of the lovers looked distorted. It was better not to see the faces of each other. Not to spoil the game, the darkness was good. Under the blanket of darkness they could manage to believe that everything was going right.\nIt needed a little more intelligence to ask why you should remain bounded by the night. Animals are\nbounded by a certain period in the year. Man’s intelligence freed him for the whole year.\nIn the East they are bound to make love in the night, silently – nobody should know about it. In the West, intelligence has grown a little better. Why in the night only? In fact, a man who is tired after the whole day’s work, worries, tensions, anxieties – what kind of love is he going to make? His love is more or less like a sleeping pill. It gives him good sleep, it gives him relaxation. The whole day he was so burdened that his heart was not functioning normally. Making love, he loses energy; the heart starts cooling down, calming down.\nNow it is a medically-established fact that people who make love never have heart attacks. The longer in their life they go on making love, the more powerful, relaxed their heart remains. Have you heard, in the millions of years of the past, that anybody has died while he was making love?\nPeople have died in every kind of situation. People have died eating, people have died sleeping, people have died working, people have died walking, people have died talking, but strange – people have never died making love. It establishes something: that love is a relaxation. It is good for sleep and good for your heart, but after a tiring day it cannot be much of a joy. Just a last thing to do somehow, quickly, and then turn your back and go to sleep – a kind of duty.\nMorning, perhaps, is the best time to make love. Energies are fresh, you are rested, there is no anxiety burdening you, it is the beginning of the day. And to make love in the beginning should be considered something auspicious, holy; you cannot begin the day religiously without making love. But still you are in a biological bondage.\nAfter enlightenment, love is no longer a need. In that way there is a transcendence. Love becomes just like any game: playing cards, playing tennis.… I have loved many women, and I am the first enlightened person in the world who is being absolutely truthful to you. You could have never found out whether I am celibate or not. I thought, although I have not said I am celibate, you would consider me a celibate. I have not participated in this lying positively, but negatively I am responsible. And now I am not going to hide anything from you.\nOnce Gautam Buddha’s most intimate disciple, Ananda, asked him, “Osho, can you tell me the\nessential quality of your philosophy in a very short statement?”\nBuddha said, “My philosophy is like a fist; it is a secret. I have not told you everything. The most precious is hidden.”\nIf you ask me, I will say my philosophy is both hands open before you. I am not going to keep anything private, anything secret. For the first time, an enlightened man is trusting the people who love him. But I would not like to be loved by you according to your conceptions, your conditions. I don’t need that kind of love, it is poisonous. I would like you to learn to be open to me the way I am open to you.\nI am not a fist, but an open hand – and not only one hand, but both hands. And if you can love me still, then that love will be meaningful.\nIt is a strange phenomenon that you have never considered. Why do you want the enlightened man, your master, to be naked, to be celibate, to be eating one time only in a day, sleeping on a hard bed, not allowing women any closeness, eating only certain things?\nIf you see Gautam Buddha drinking even a Coca Cola, you will not anymore consider him enlightened – he has not even transcended Coca Cola. I don’t drink Coca Cola, but I love it. I cannot drink it because of my physicians; Devaraj is after me, Shunyo is after me. I cannot drink Coca Cola, I had to transcend it. But it is not enlightenment that helped me to transcend it, it is diabetes!\nYour old religious leaders were captives of your expectations. I am nobody’s prisoner. And I feel very light, because I am not burdened. I can say to you everything; there is nothing being withheld. All your masters were withholding things from you. I do not consider them authentic, open, sincere. Even to their own disciples they were not true.\nIf enlightenment does not make you transcend hunger, thirst, urination, then why should it make you transcend your sex? Sex is part of your whole being, it is not something separate. You eat, you drink, you exercise. Your body has nothing to do with your enlightenment; the body will go on functioning in the same way. It will create blood, it will create semen. How can enlightenment make you transcend sex? You will have to stop eating, you will have to stop drinking. In fact, you will have to stop breathing; only then will there be a transcendence – in your death.\nSex is a natural phenomenon. Yes, it takes fourteen years to make your sexual energy mature. And if you enjoy it blissfully, without any condemnation, without any Christ standing between you and your beloved.…\nI think this is very disgusting of these enlightened people – always poking their nose into your affairs, always watching you from the keyhole, what you are doing. And naturally, because they go on watching you from the keyhole, you also go on watching them even more carefully, because you may be following a wrong man. You have to be certain that his is a twenty-four carat enlightenment.\nIt fulfills your ego that you are a follower of an enlightened master. That’s why, Mr. Camel, you got shocked. I am sorry for you. You are a fellow traveler of a simple, natural, authentic, open person. You are not my followers, because to make you my followers I would have to follow you! Then I would have to keep continuously alert that something is not found out by you.\nCelibacy is unnatural – at least, up to the age of forty-two. Between fourteen years and forty-two, celibacy is absolutely unnatural, and if you force yourself to remain a celibate, you will become just a pervert. Your sexual energy will find ways. It is very simple.…\nHow long can you keep your bladder full? Sooner or later either you have to rush towards the toilet or the bladder will drop any idea of your support and will start functioning on its own. Semen is a similar phenomenon. It is manufactured in you, by your food, by your breathing, by your exercise, by your very living. How long can you hold it? And holding it is such a painful job! That’s why you see your saints so sad.\nIt is natural, if your bladder is full and you are afraid that, “Now I am coming near the boundary when there will be no control” Semen is a natural by-product of your life. Yes, after enlightenment there\nis a tremendous change. To me, that is transcendence. That does not mean you stop making love. That simply means it is no longer a need, you are no longer a slave to it. Just, in moments when you want to play with the energy that you have, you can make love. And if the other person is also of the same quality, or even is moving in the same direction, your love will become meditation.\nAll other religions have forced you to become perverts. In your monasteries there is masturbation but no meditation. And I want to say the thing as it is: Transcendence simply means slavery is transcended. Now I am not making any love to anybody, for the simple reason that I am no longer healthy, my body is fragile. It is not ready to play tennis! It is nothing spiritual – if I get my health back again, which I have wasted for you.…\nJust think of me for thirty years continuously wandering in India, and in return getting stones, shoes and knives thrown at me. And you don’t know Indian railways, waiting rooms, you don’t know the way Indians live. It is unhygienic, ugly, but they are accustomed to it. I had suffered for those thirty years as much – perhaps more – than Jesus suffered on the cross. To be on the cross is a question only of a few hours. To be assassinated is even quicker. But to be a wandering master in India is no joke.\nI was the healthiest person you could find. Before I started these journeys, knowing perfectly well my health was going to be destroyed I had to eat all kinds of food, and in India the food pattern\nchanges just within a few miles. I had to live with dirt, uncleanliness, and I had to be ready for all these rewards – stones, shoes, knives being thrown at me. And India is a vast country, almost a continent – I was always on the train.\nThere are places which take forty-eight hours to reach by the train. And aeroplanes reach only to a few capital cities. If you want to reach the people you have to go in a train. And if you want to enter the very central parts of the country, you have to use even worse trains. Of course, I went on and on destroying my health, knowing perfectly well what I was doing.\nBut what I had found I wanted at any cost – at the cost of my life – to share with a few people, to make them afire. My body may die in the effort, but I have made a few other bodies lighted with the same flame, and they will go on spreading the fire around the earth.\nPeople used to say to me, “Your body is like a marble statue.” It was. My weight was one hundred and ninety pounds, and it was not fatness – I have never been fat. It was immensely solid, like a rock. I was never sick, I was unaware what it means to be sick. But as my body went on deteriorating, I became aware what headache is, what migraine is, what stomach upset is, what finally became my diabetes and my asthma. Now I am only one hundred and thirty-one pounds, down from one hundred and ninety.\nNow I don’t have any energy for any game. Whatsoever energy I have got, I want it to be devoted to you and to my people around the world. I want to say so many things to you, and life is so short – one cannot be certain even of tomorrow. But I am determined that death will have to wait till I have fulfilled my task, because it is no longer my task; I have disappeared long ago. Now it is existence meeting you, existence trying to reach you. I am only a vehicle.\nBut one fact I have proved absolutely and forever– that making love does not destroy enlightenment. On the contrary, it makes it richer, more beautiful – new flowers in it, new colors in it, new fragrances in it, new laughter, new smiles. The whole idea that the enlightened man cannot make love is absolutely wrong.\nBut you got shocked because of your expectation. You are unenlightened, you don’t know enlightenment. First, to become enlightened is so arduous – the camel changing into the lion, the lion changing into the child. And when you have passed this whole long track, you are not courageous enough to do something that may spoil the whole pilgrimage.\nBut, forgive me, I am a different type of man. When I became enlightened, I wanted to test it in every fire: if it passes through all fire tests, then only is it real. Otherwise, I was hallucinating, I was just\nimagining that I had become enlightened. And I can say to you now that I have done everything that no enlightened person is expected to do – even things in which I was not interested at all, but just to test that I was not hallucinating.…\nAfter my enlightenment I smoked my first cigarette. I had never had any interest in doing such a silly thing. When you can breathe fresh air and exhale, why should you pollute it with smoke, with dangerous nicotine? But I did smoke, for almost one month. It was difficult, I was coughing; it was a hard thing to do.\nI used to live with one of my friends. He was puzzled; he said, “You are mad! You were never\ninterested in cigarettes, and now you are smoking continually.”\nCoughing, tears coming to my eyes, I said, “I have to see whether the cigarette is stronger than the enlightenment. I have to give it a chance.”\nI have done everything after enlightenment which has been thought would destroy enlightenment. And I tell you now that nothing can destroy enlightenment, because enlightenment is not just an experience, it is a transformation. It is not that it happens once and you see the light, and then the whole of your life you remember with joy that vision, that opening of the window to existence. It is not like that. Enlightenment transforms you. You are totally a new man.\nBut of course, if I start smoking here while I am speaking to you, many camels are going to be shocked. But I am an unreliable man, I live moment to moment. If it happens to me, tomorrow you will see a table by my side with the best cigarettes in the world – what is it? Five-Five-Five? – and a bottle of champagne, and my Gudia, one of the most beautiful girls I have come across, pouring champagne into the glass for me. I can do that, it is just a question of the idea arising in me. Then nobody can prevent me.\nI have found freedom in dropping being respectable. Respectability is a social strategy to keep you imprisoned. Around the world there are so many rumors.… I don’t care a bit. Sometimes I have been told by my friends and lovers, “Why don’t you contradict them? These are absolutely absurd, they destroy your respectability with people.”\nI said, “I don’t want to be respected by anyone, because if he respects me he will expect me to remain respectable” – and that I cannot promise. It is better to be notorious, because it gives you immense freedom. I am a notorious man. Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Lao Tzu – none of them was courageous enough to drop the desire for respectability.\nPeople go on condemning me. The moment I come to know that they are condemning me for a certain thing, then I go on doing the same thing on a bigger scale. I had only one Rolls Royce. They started condemning me, so I told my secretary, “Arrange for two.”\nIn India it was very difficult, because the Rolls Royce after 1965 became a banned item, it could not enter the country. I was the only man who managed to have two Rolls Royces enter the country.\nWhen I came to America, I said to my secretary, “Now there is no limit.” I had seven, and they were\ncondemning me – a spiritual man, an enlightened person, having seven Rolls Royces when people\nare dying of starvation? Now I have ninety. Now they don’t condemn me. They know that if they\ncontinue condemning me, I will go on having more and more Rolls Royces until they are satisfied.\nI have my own individuality. I don’t need anybody’s respect, because I am so full there is no space for anything else. And it has been a tremendous experience to be so notorious and yet to be loved by millions of people. That gives a great hope, that even an ordinary man can be loved; you need not to be extraordinary to be loved.\nHow much love I have received! I don’t think anybody before me has received so much love. And certainly I have received more hostility, anger, condemnation than anybody else. I am richest man in the world – I receive everything!\nLove I have received – nobody can come even close to me. Hatred I have received – nobody can come close to me. And just for a single, simple thing: that I dropped the idea of respectability.\nIf you ask me, my enlightenment made me transcend only one thing, and that is the opinion of others. That is their business. They cannot disturb my sleep by their opinions. And I don’t have to be concerned about what they are thinking. I am living absolutely alone, but utterly fulfilled.\nYou ask me why you were shocked – because you are still a camel. The lions were not shocked. They must have roared! They must have found a synchronicity between me and themselves. They must have been rejoiced and danced: “Our master is not celibate, so we need not be unnecessarily depressed that we are not celibate.”\nThose who have reached the stage of being a child, they must have enjoyed knowing that at least in this whole world there is one man who can say everything truly without taking an oath that, “Whatever I say, I will say only the truth.”\nI am not one who has taken an oath to speak the truth. I simply want you to understand what a beauty it is to be truthful, authentic, just the way you are. I have put my heart in front of you. Now it is up to you whether to be shocked, or to rejoice. It will depend on your mind. But you cannot influence me; nobody in my whole life has influenced me. Anybody who has tried has found that he was forcing me to do just the opposite. Slowly, slowly people dropped the idea.\nIn India, Jainas were a great majority of my lovers, but the day I spoke on sex that majority – camels – simply disappeared. Yes, a few remained, a few of them are even here. They proved to be lions; they could see and connect themselves with my truth.\nThere were many Gandhians – until the day I spoke against Gandhi and said that he was the most cunning politician, not only of this century but of the whole history, that all his religion was mumbo- jumbo; it was a curtain to dominate the whole country. And although he was saying that he was in search of truth, he was continually lying, just like a politician.\nHe was saying that when the country becomes free, all the armies will be dissolved; there will be no military, there will be no weapons, because a nonviolent country has no need of such things. One American author, Louis Fisher, asked him, “If you dissolve all the armies and the military, and you don’t have any weapons, and somebody attacks you, what will you do?”\nHe said, “We will welcome them. We will say to them, ‘There is no need for any bloodshed. If you want to live here in this country, come, be our guests. You are welcome.’”\nBut this was before freedom came to India. When India became independent, everything changed. The army was not dissolved, but increased. The military was not dissolved – now India has one of the biggest military forces. Weapons were not dissolved. India has atomic plants and is now making every effort to have nuclear weapons – at the cost of half of the country dying, without food! India is exporting wheat to other countries, because the politicians need money to make a nuclear plant. And these are all Gandhians.\nWhen Gandhi was alive, after independence, Pakistan attacked one part of Kashmir. India had to fight with the invaders, and you cannot believe that Gandhi blessed the first fighter planes to go and destroy Pakistanis – who were Indians just a few days before! Where had his nonviolence gone? He was blessing fighting planes, sending them to destroy the same people for whom he had been fighting for freedom his whole life.\nWhen I said that his nonviolence was a political strategy It was clear that to fight against the British\ngovernment with weapons was impossible. From where are you going to get all those weapons against the empire? – perhaps the biggest empire that has existed ever. It was said that the sun never sets on the British empire. It was true: if it sets in one country, it rises in another, but as far as the whole British empire is concerned, it never sets. This was the biggest empire of man’s history. Against this empire how can you fight?\nAnd not only can you not fight, you don’t have the means to fight. You don’t have even men to fight – Indians are so lousy, so cowardly, so superstitious, and so faithful to the idea that nothing happens without God’s will. “It is God’s will that Britain is ruling our country. To fight against Britain and its empire is to fight against God’s will.” That was the Indian conditioning.\nNaturally Gandhi invented a new strategy – nonviolence, which was always respected by the Indians as the most significant religious quality. But his nonviolence was not that of a religious man.\nI am nonviolent. You see the guards around me with weapons and now they are being criticized.\nRemember, that criticism will create more and more guards and more and more weapons. But I know that those weapons are just toys. Against nuclear powers, you are carrying a small gun. I know it, I know it makes no sense, but the gun is not the point! And I have not arranged those guards either. I don’t know even who my guards are, what their names are.\nIt is you, the people who love me – a person who never fulfills any of your expectations – you are worried about my life. It is your love; otherwise those guards are just of no use. Just a bomb will finish it can become another Nagasaki, Hiroshima. But I am nonviolent.\nPeople have been asking me, if I am nonviolent then why are these weapons here? Those weapons are your love, and I respect your love, knowingly perfectly well those weapons are toys. But I know the person who is carrying the weapon is carrying it out of love. There is no other reason. I cannot tell him to throw the weapon, because that would be an insult to his love. I cannot insult love, I have tremendous respect for love.\nYou have to come out of your shock; otherwise the bridge between me and you will be broken.\nRemember perfectly, I am not going to change in any way. If change has to come, it has to come to you and your mind, because it is your disturbance, your shock. It is your problem – take the responsibility for it. See the simple fact that you were carrying some expectations – that means some chains for me. It is time: throw those chains.\nI am an absolutely free man. There is no bondage for me. I can do anything, you just have to suggest it to me!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI LOVE YOUR VISION, BUT WHENEVER I LISTEN TO YOU SPEAKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD, I FEEL LIKE POLITICIANS AND PRIESTS ARE TOO POWERFUL AND TOO DEEPLY ASLEEP FOR OUR SONGS AND OUR LAUGHTER TO TURN THE WORLD AROUND. IS THIS SKEPTICISM?\nIt is not skepticism – for that a little more intelligence is needed. It is simply stupidity.\nI also know that the powers of the politicians and the priests are so vast. What can our laughter, our song, our dances, our love, do against these big powers?\nI have to tell you one thing, that if an atom of hydrogen gas can release so much energy that it becomes the hydrogen bomb, a hundred times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima or Nagasaki, why do you think that authentic love – which is the most precious thing in the world – that a real rejoicing, that a total laughter when you are not laughing but you are laughter, that a dance in which the dancer disappears cannot release a totally different kind of energy?\nAll these priests and politicians have the energy derived from matter. I am trying to tell you that if material energy can be so big, spiritual energy can be a million or billion times bigger. It just has not been tried, ever. This is a good opportunity.\nRemember, the “opportunist” has been used always in a condemnatory sense. I want it to be freed from that association. A really intelligent person is always an opportunist. To me, an opportunist means one who takes the challenge of the opportunity and risks himself.\nWhat are we going to lose? If my sannyasins all around the world go on spreading songs and dances and love, these politicians will look stupid. Right now, they cannot be much bothered with the humanity that is there. If it is destroyed, so what? – it is not worth anything. But if we can make the earth blossom with new people, the politicians will have heart attacks. The very idea of destroying these people, this earth, will become inconceivable.\nAnd the man of laughter, the man who can dance in tune with the wind and the sun and the moon, is far more powerful than any nuclear weapon can be, because his is life energy. They are playing with dead matter. If dead matter can release so much energy, a living being... it is inconceivable how much energy he can release.\nWe can create of this whole world a celebration.\nAnd I tell you, your politicians will commit suicide, because they will be the only sad people, they will be the only ones who are unfit. And I don’t think, howsoever idiotic they are, they can think of destroying the laughter, the songs, the beauty of love, the innocence of a child, and the authenticity of enlightened people.\nJust take the challenge of the time. They are going to destroy you anyway – why not celebrate before they do it? Let them create death for the whole earth. But what are we going to lose? We will die laughing, dancing, singing. We are not going to be like Hiroshima or Nagasaki.\nIn the first place, it is impossible. If we really work for the New Man to go on spreading like wildfire, it is impossible for them to destroy this earth. Even their conscience – which is not much – will not allow them to destroy this beautiful garden of people.\nAnd the laughter is not American or Soviet, it is not Indian or English. Rejoicing has no nations.\nSongs, dances, and disappearing into your dances and your songs, don’t belong to any religion.\nThe New Man will declare this whole earth his own. Politicians will simply fall by the way. They will not be able to figure out what to do with these people. They know how to deal with the sad slaves – slaves of theologies, political ideologies, they know how to deal with them.\nMy effort is to create a man that they simply have never seen. They will simply stagger and fall wherever they are. And I don’t see that a world full of flowers and fragrance can be destroyed. But just for argument’s sake, even if it is destroyed, that is the best way to go away from this earth to some other planet – dancing, singing, rejoicing. Yes, they can destroy your body, but they cannot destroy your spirit. And I am trying to create a man who has spirit, ecstasy.\nYou can ride upon your ecstasy to other planets; rockets are not needed. And remember, only bodies die, the soul within you is immortal. No nuclear weapons can destroy it. You have something indestructible in you; you just have to become aware of it, and you have to make others aware of it.\nI am not concerned about the future. I am concerned with you, with people who have been given a chance of drinking the wine of life, squeezing the whole juice of it every moment. The future makes no sense to me, but it is going to come whether it makes sense to me or not.\nAnd I am not worried about myself. I died thirty-two years ago, and the one who is speaking to you is beyond any nuclear weapon. I would like you also to be beyond nuclear weapons. And these are the methods: the laughter, the joy, love, rejoicing, making your life a beautiful garden.\nThe last moment of your life is very decisive. Nothing is more decisive in your whole life. The last moment of your life... if it is a dance, you will join other dancers in some other planet. If it is love, you will join some planet where love is no longer sin, where love is religion.\nSo what I am saying to you is double-edged. On the one hand it can stop the third world war; on the other hand it can take you to the right place amongst right people. Whatever happens in the future is not my concern. My concern is with this moment, because the next moment may be the last moment on the earth.\nRemember this: when you go to sleep, say goodbye to life with great gratitude. It has given you so much – never forget it. I don’t say to you, go to sleep praying to Jesus Christ on your knees, or Gautam Buddha or some other guy. I say to you, go to your sleep with a thankful heart for all that life has given to you: all the laughter, all the loves, all the beautiful flowers, the songs of the birds, the colorful rainbows, the amazing sunsets, sunrises. It has given you so much that if there is not going to be tomorrow you have not missed anything.\nLet there be no tomorrow; you are already fulfilled. And if by chance you wake up again tomorrow morning, don’t start with any mantra-chanting or prayer – these are all irreligious ways. Again, start the day with gratitude, love, joy.\nPeople say that you should not get out of the bed with the wrong leg, wrong foot, because then you spoil your whole day. As for as I know, legs have nothing to do with your day. I would like you, when you get up, to get up with laughter. Any leg will do, but go to your bathroom dancing!\nCHAPTER 25\nSeeing the fact, drop the fiction\n23 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEARN GRACE, BEAUTY, ETIQUETTE. BUT NOW, WHEN YOU ARE TEACHING US GENUINE GRACE AND BEAUTY, A LOT OF US ARE SO INSENSITIVE TO GRACIOUSNESS AND AESTHETICS THAT EVEN COMING CLOSE TO YOU, IN THE PRESENCE OF YOU, WE CONTINUE THE RESENTMENTS OF FORCED GRACE, BEAUTY, ETIQUETTE, ETC. WE BEHAVE WITHOUT RESPECT, LOVE, DIGNITY TOWARDS OUR BELOVED MASTER – YOU, OSHO.\nPLEASE SAY SOMETHING TO OUR THICK BRAINS SO WE DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE GRACEFUL EXPERIENCE.\nIt is almost natural that when you drop any conditioning there is a gap between the dropping of the conditioning and the beginning of the genuine, the natural, the spontaneous in you. That gap happens easily.\nFrom your very childhood you have been told to be respectful. You were not able even to see why you should respect this man. You had no reason to respect the man, but you were forced. You were dependent, you were too small to fight against it. That resentment is always underneath your respect. Just a little scratching and your resentment will come up, because it is as old as your respect, etiquette, grace. Each time you have been trained for these things, resentment has been created in you side by side, just like a shadow.\nThese are not things to be taught, these are qualities to be caught. And when they are caught there is no resentment; when they are caught they are spontaneous, natural. You don’t have to do them, they happen of their own accord. But this has not been the case up to now. For millions of years you have lived with a duality, a thick layer of resentment – which is deeper, more underground – and a thin layer of forced grace, sensitivity, aesthetics, respect, love.\nThe basic thing, the fundamental thing is to understand that when you drop your grace – the learned one; when you drop love – the learned one, remember also to drop the resentment. That too is learned. You have learned it on your own, against all those people who had power over you. If you don’t drop it then I can go on telling you, “Be naturally graceful,” and you will think, “It is good, there is no need to make any effort to be graceful.” Your thin layer will disappear – but where will the resentment go?\nThat resentment will become your behavior. Instead of respect, you will start disrespecting anybody and everybody. Instead of the arousal of a natural love... the bogus love has gone, now you have only hate. That’s why societies and cultures are afraid. They are trembling always because they are depending on something which is not natural.\nBut you have to understand that when you drop the learned thing, the conditioned thing, don’t forget to drop with it the resentment that had come with it; otherwise, you will become ungraceful, and to be ungraceful is ugly. You will become disrespectful and to be disrespectful is not human. It is falling below the human.\nYou have got this whole beautiful existence. You don’t deserve it; nobody deserves it. You had not even asked for it. You have suddenly found yourself amidst these beautiful millions of stars, the flowers, the birds. And if you are disrespectful, you will be blind to all that commands respect, you will turn your back to all that which commands respect.\nIt does not demand. It does not say to you, “Respect me, I am your father.” But silently have you not felt sometimes the flowers, without saying a word, are commanding your respect, your love, your grace? And the same applies to other human beings.\nWe are all strangers to each other. We come into the world alone, and if you are not graceful, not loving, not sensitive, you will find yourself in a state of loneliness, abandoned. Who cares about such a person? That will strengthen your resentment even more, and will make you more and more ugly.\nThe basic fault has been made by the society, the culture, the religion. Nothing can be done about it, except one thing, of which you are capable: seeing the fact, drop the fiction. But always remember that behind the fiction you have been always carrying antagonism to it.\nFrom my very childhood I was wild. My whole family was trying to make me cultured, graceful, respectful, but they failed. Fortunately, they failed. I had decided one thing: that if something is natural, it will come on its own. There is no need to learn it, to rehearse it.\nIn India, there are joint families. In one family there may be fifty people, sixty people. Every old person in the family has to be respected. And I know that this old guy needs to be beaten, rather\nthan respected; there is no reason why I should respect him. Just because of his age? But then, I don’t see any relationship between respect and age. There are trees four thousand years old, there are animals who live longer than man.\nNietzsche has described these three stages: the camel, the lion, the child. He has taken only the evolutionary part and described these three stages. He has forgotten that there are exactly the same stages below the camel – the camel is not the lowest animal in the world. Of course, considering Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution, I say the monkey is below the camel; otherwise there would be no man.\nNietzsche is not talking about the actual camel, he is talking about man – that he can be a camel. And if man is born out of monkeys, then certainly the monkey will be a lower stage than the camel. And you can easily recognize amongst yourselves how monkeyish is your behavior. That destroys your grace, that destroys your serenity.\nBelow the monkey is certainly the donkey, who is absolutely thick. You cannot teach a donkey any tricks. Have you seen any circus where donkeys are doing something? – impossible. Elephants are there, horses are there, monkeys are there, but everybody has forgotten about the donkey – such an important personality, more famous than the monkey and the camel.\nDonkeys are absolutely stubborn – no intelligence; you cannot teach them anything. You can go on loading the donkey with your holy scriptures; he will carry the weight, but will never understand the meaning. And of course, below the donkey there is only the Yankee. And you all know about the Yankee; there is nothing to be said about the Yankee. You have to start from the Yankee – at least become a donkey.\nThe Yankee is absolutely phony. The donkey is at least authentically real. He may not listen to you, but he follows his nature, his instinct, without any interference from anybody.\nIn my village there were many donkeys – of course, in every place there are many donkeys – and I loved to ride on donkeys. In India, that is not right. In other countries, for example in Judea, Jesus was riding on the donkey always, it was acceptable. But in India, the donkey is thought to be the worst kind of animal – they don’t know about the Yankee. After even just touching the donkey you have to take a bath.\nI became enchanted with the donkeys. Why should the poor animal be abandoned? I started finding donkeys in the night, and I would ride on them. And I was amazed to know that it is wrong, the idea that the donkey is without intelligence.\nIf you ride on the donkey, he will never move in the middle of the road. He will go to the sides and move so close to the walls of the houses that your whole leg is almost crushed. It is very difficult to keep him in the middle. Right or left – either he is a rightist or a leftist, but never has the donkey listened to the advice of Gautam Buddha, that exactly in the middle is the right path.\nAnd then I recognized that they are intelligent people. To get rid of me – he has no weapons, but he has found a way. If I see my leg being rubbed against a stone wall, I am bound to jump off and leave the donkey to himself.\nI was trying all the donkeys of the town. Slowly, slowly they became really acquainted with me, and then I could see even a deeper layer of intelligence. They became aware even of my footsteps in some miraculous way. The donkey may be fifty feet, a hundred feet away, and I would move very slowly, very cautiously so that he did not become aware that I was coming – but he immediately would start running. He knew my steps, he felt in some way my presence.\nOther people would be just passing by him and he was not worried. And I was a hundred feet away, taking every care not to disturb the poor fellow, but he would start escaping. He knew who was coming, he knew what my purpose was. He knew there was going to be trouble, because when I saw that these donkeys are cunning, not so dumb as people think, I started to take them into the fields where there were no walls. Then the donkey, of course, was at a loss. What to do? Whether he was rightist or leftist, it did not matter; there were no walls.\nBecause I started taking them to the the fields outside the town, they became very sensitive about my presence. Even donkeys have a certain intelligence.\nCamels, howsoever ugly they look, are very gentlemanly. And in the deserts they are very friendly – to the point that if you are dying of thirst, they are ready to sacrifice themselves. When in the desert a camel is killed – because he keeps a reservoir of water inside himself.…\nI have heard from people who own caravans of camels that when you kill a camel in the desert the camel makes no resistance, he simply allows you to kill him. He is perfectly aware that this is the moment to be of some service to you. In some unknown way he feels you have been thirsty for days and you cannot survive unless he gives you his water reservoir.\nA camel can move in the desert for six weeks without any trouble, needing no water. That much water he keeps within himself for emergency purposes. I could not believe it, that he does not resist being killed. I enquired, “If you kill a camel where there is no emergency or any danger to your life, does the camel resist?”\nThey said, “You say resist? He will kill you! He knows that there is no need for him to be sacrificed; this is simple murder.” And a camel is a big animal, huge, of great power, he can simply crush you under his feet, no weapons are needed. But deep in the desert, lost in the desert, he does not resist. That is something really to be understood.\nThe camel is graceful to the point that he can sacrifice himself. He is respectful and loving, so much so, that he is ready to die so that you can live. He puts your life above his. He is not egocentric.\nAnd in man you will find all these animals. I am not talking about the real monkeys, donkeys, camels, lions, the child, so don’t get confused. The real child is so nasty that even after enlightenment I cannot sleep in the same room as a small child. The whole night he will disturb you. In the day he sleeps perfectly well, but as the night comes – of course, his sleep is over, now he is ready to torture you. He finds excuses: “I want to go to the toilet. I am thirsty. I am hungry. I am feeling too cold, I need one blanket more.”\nSo when I am talking about these stages, I am talking symbolically. To me, when I say the child it simply means innocence, simplicity, no desire for any power, no hankering to dominate anybody, and a tremendous beauty.\nHave you seen any child who is ugly? All children are beautiful. But what happens to all these beautiful children when they grow up? They all disappear. They start becoming cunning, cruel, diplomatic, political. They lose their innocence, they lose their grace, they lose their beauty.\nAmongst you, all kinds of these people are there. And it is not that you can define somebody as the camel. In fact, in each person they are all mixed up. Each person has all these qualities, from the Yankee to the child.\nThe society is afraid that if you are left alone You will turn into a Yankee, a monkey – at the most\na donkey, or perhaps if you are fortunate enough, a camel. But beyond that your parents, your civilization is afraid. You cannot be left alone; you have to be trained, and their training has proved poisonous. With all good intentions they have destroyed your spontaneity. With all their well- wishings, they have made you a hypocrite.\nI am all for naturalness.\nThe question is significant, because when you listen to me say that I am all for naturalness, you immediately drop what you always wanted to drop. But you don’t become natural. You have forgotten the resentment. By dropping your etiquette, by dropping your grace, by dropping your cultivated beauty, by dropping your make-up, you are not simply going to become natural. There is something more between your phony self and your real self: your resentment. And you have thick layers of resentment, because for your whole life you have resented.\nAnd the resentment was yours. The grace was imposed by others – it is easy to drop it, you always wanted to drop it – but the resentment was yours. It is closer to you, it is more difficult to drop it. But unless you drop your grace, cultivated beauty – just make-up; unless you drop your nice etiquette – behavior which is just diplomatic – unless with all this that has been forced upon you, you remember to drop the resentment because now there is no need for resentment.\nYou are getting free of all those things which were the causes of your resentment. You can easily get rid of things that have been forced upon you, but the things that arose within you – there comes the real problem. You have to drop your resentment. If you cannot drop it, the natural flow of your energies will not be available.\nIt has been happening in all of history: many people have dropped the forced values. Just a few years back you had hippies all around – they had dropped the forced etiquette, the forced niceness, the forced cleanliness. They had been told, “Cleanliness is next to God, only God is above cleanliness.” They were forced to take baths, they were forced to do this, that. They were forced to go to the school, to the college. They dropped all that, but they did not drop the resentment.\nHippies did not flower into beautiful human beings. Their resentment burned them. They went just to the opposite pole; they stopped taking baths. Dirtiness became next to God, uncleanliness became a value. The more unclean, the more dirty you were, the greater you were considered to be by other hippies who were not so courageous as you were. Once in a while they took a bath, once in a while they cleaned themselves. It created guilt in them. Just see the phenomenon!\nMany hippies have visited me. I felt really sorry for them. They were going on a right path, but somewhere the path turned to the polar opposite. Their resentment was so strong that they started\ndoing exactly the opposite of what they were taught to do. They dropped out of schools, out of colleges, out of universities, because it was not their own choice.\nBut do you know what happened to the hippies? You don’t find them. After the age thirty-five they come back to the society, become again what they have been taught. Their long hair disappears, their beards disappear, their mustaches disappear. All the hippies who have reached nearabout the age of forty are now perfectly accepted gentlemen in the society. They are good businessmen, good salesmen, successful.\nThis was bound to happen. You cannot live in resentment for long; it is a fire, it will burn you. So you don’t find old hippies – seventy years old. You don’t find old hippies. In fact, that should have been the case: as a hippie gets older, he should become even hippier. But something happens by the time they start crossing the borderline of thirty-five.\nThere was a day when hippies declared, “We do not believe anybody who is more than thirty years old.” There was a truth in it. But you cannot stop your age at thirty. It isn’t like a clock that you can stop at any moment; it goes on growing whether you are a hippie or not. And by the time they are close to thirty-five, the exact middle point in life – after thirty-five they will start declining, their energies will start getting lower and lower – they become afraid. How are they going to live?\nThen suddenly they want to be married, to have a stable life, to have some profession, some job, some money. Old age is coming close – they don’t want to die on the streets. It was perfectly good when they were young, they had energy enough. That energy has been burned by their resentment.\nThey thought they were being revolutionaries; they were not, they were simply reactionaries. They were reacting to their parents, to their society, to their education. Reaction is not revolution, revolution needs much more meditative understanding. Then you don’t go to the other pole, the other extreme; then you remain just exactly in the middle. And only in the middle will your natural being show. But there will be a gap. Before the natural starts flowing in you, you will have to get rid of all the hindrances to it.\nI can understand your question. You say, “It hurts to see sannyasins becoming disrespectful.” But the commune has to be patient with any sannyasin who is disrespectful, ungraceful, behaves in a cruel way, talks just to hurt you. The commune has to be patient: that person is going through a great change. Patience and help – both are needed for him.\nEven if he is not respectful to you, you all have to be respectful to him. He needs it – this is the moment. He may not be very loving to you, or may be even hateful to you. He is sick, he needs all your compassion.\nAnd that’s the function of the commune. If five thousand people go on pouring their love on the person who replies with hatred, how long is he going to survive? He behaves disrespectfully, and five thousand people don’t take any note of his disrespectfulness; they go on being respectful to the person. Soon he will drop his resentment.\nThese are not the people who had forced him to do certain things against his will. These are a totally different kind of people: you disrespect them, still they smile and are loving and respectful to you. They are not your parents, they are not your teachers. They are not your old rotten society.\nMy communes are harbingers of a new man, a new world.\nBut you have to be very aware, because if somebody is disrespectful towards you, it is a little difficult to be respectful to him. But be respectful out of love for humanity, out of compassion for your brothers and sisters, and understanding the fact that that man is not being disrespectful to you – he is being disrespectful to his parents, to his teachers, to the priest. You are just an excuse. It is just a coincidence that he has found you; otherwise, he would have been disrespectful to somebody else.\nDon’t take it personally. Living in a commune, remember you are not personalities. Certainly you are individuals, but don’t take anything personally. The person is sick, he needs hospitalization. He needs more love than anybody else, he needs more warmth than anybody else. This is the way the commune becomes the crucible of transformation.\nThe sannyasins who are living outside the communes don’t have this opportunity. If they can manage to be in the commune, they should be in the commune, because there you have the possibility of dropping all garbage, all your resentment, and becoming your natural self again. There you can find your original face again.\nBut there may be thousands of sannyasins who cannot manage for hundreds of reasons to be in a commune. For them I would suggest, if you cannot be a permanent resident in a commune, at least every year make it a point – six weeks, eight weeks, twelve weeks – to be in the commune. Learn the flavor of the New Man. Then perhaps even in the outside, old, rotten and dead society you may be able to protect yourself from their rottenness.\nJust the other day one journalist had asked me, “Cannot your commune and the neighbors live in coexistence?” I simply said, “No!” I don’t think he will be able to understand my no, there is every possibility he will misinterpret it. But my no has tremendous implications in it.\nIt means... he was asking, “Can you sleep in the same room in coexistence with a corpse?” It will be difficult to sleep if the corpse is also sleeping by the side on the double bed. You may have loved the corpse before, but now that you know it is a corpse you will be in a nightmare, waiting for the morning, to get out of this room.\nI said no, because the old society and the New Man cannot coexist. The old, the dead will have to give way for the new, for the fresh.\nWe are not hostile towards them, for the simple reason that we are the new, and the victory is ours! They are hostile; deep down in their unconscious they understand that they’re dying and you are living, that they are getting more and more rotten and you are getting more and more juicy. They are hostile. It is natural, because they have to empty the space for the New Man to take over.\nSomebody else had asked me, “Do you intend to take over Oregon?”\nI said, “No. Oregon is too small a thing. I would love to take over the whole world.”\nI am saying it on behalf of the new. I am saying it on behalf of the sun that is rising on the horizon. And it is not just a coincidence that I come from the East. In the West the sun is always going down, it is always sunset. The sunset represents death; the sunrise is the beginning of a new life.\nIt is not a coincidence that all that is great, beautiful, truthful, has arisen out of the East. India could not produce Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini – just inconceivable! India could produce Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, Nagarjuna. We are not separate from existence, we are very deeply connected. The countries of sunrise have given the best to humanity.\nIndia has never invaded any country. Such a big country could have produced the biggest empire in the world. If England can do it – which is just equal to a district of India, not even a state – why could India not create a great empire? On the other hand, the greatest emperor in India – and of course the greatest emperor in the whole history of man – Ashoka, renounced his empire. Not only did he renounce his empire, he sent his son and daughter as messengers of peace to different countries.\nHis daughter, Sanghamitra, went to Ceylon. Now Ceylon is Buddhist – then Ceylon was thought to be one of the most violent parts of the world. To convert Ceylon, Ashoka sends his beautiful only daughter? He understood human psychology: only something beautiful, something with freshness can help those barbarians then in Ceylon. It was a risk, but worth taking.\nThose who are not living in my communes, start making efforts to move towards the communes. And nothing is impossible if you want to do it. What can prevent you? What is there left in the old society? Why are you hanging around there? You are being just as stupid as dogs are.\nYou give a dog a dry bone and he will start chewing it, and will enjoy it very much. Nothing comes out of the dry bone, there is no juice in it. But the dry bone makes wounds in his mouth and blood starts coming out of those wounds. He sucks his own blood, thinking it is coming from the dry bone.\nDon’t be foolish! The society outside is just a dry bone; you will be sucking your own blood. And they\nwill all be hostile to you. They will try in every possible way to destroy your newness.\nAnd remember, a new plant is very fragile – you just have to put a rock on top of it and it will disappear. And those people have big rocks – the church, the state. They will use all kinds of means. My sannyasins have been removed from colleges as teachers, from schools, from universities, for no reason – just because they are sannyasins. Strange – you don’t remove anybody because he is a Christian, you don’t remove anybody because he is a Hindu. Why are you afraid of the sannyasin?\nTheir attitude makes me feel proud of the sannyasins. They are afraid of you. The whole university may have hundreds of professors, but just a single sannyasin and they are afraid. They know that this single man is more powerful because he is new. The future belongs to him, not to them. To them belongs the past, which is just a burden.\nBut if you are removed from your job you will find it difficult to survive. Your family will be against you. From everywhere you will find antagonism. My sannyasins have been beaten on the streets. They had done no harm to anybody, but just because they were sannyasins they were beaten. Their malas have been taken.\nThere is no need to torture yourselves with those who are already dying. There is no need to cling to the family, to the society. Perhaps you may be helpful if you change yourself, move to the commune, and once in a while visit the family, the friends, and let them see what has happened to you, what is happening to you. That is the only way to help them.\nParents have written to me, “We were afraid that when our sons or our daughters became sannyasins we had lost them forever. But we want to be forgiven by you, because when this time my daughter came back home, for the first time we could relate heart to heart. There was no need to say much, she was just holding my hand and it was enough.” Something transpired between the sannyasin daughter and the old father. She would not have been able to do it if she had remained with those old people. A certain gap is needed.\nYou need to live in the commune to catch the fire, to become aflame. Then once in a while, certainly go.\nWe are not interested in converting those dead people, because what is the point? We will have to celebrate every night in the crematorium; that will be too much unnecessary work. We are not interested in converting those people, but we are certainly interested that those whose days are gone should understand that they need not feel sorry; a better man, a better woman is going to take their place. They can go without any complaint. They can leave life joyously, because the people who are going to take over will be able to manage better than they have ever done.\nFor thousands of years, the politician and the priest, in a deep conspiracy, have been in power. But what have they done to you? What have they done to the world? Monkeys remain monkeys, donkeys remain donkeys, camels remain camels – no transformation in human beings.\nIt is not their fault. A camel cannot see that there is anything better than a camel. It is just short- sightedness. And you cannot put glasses on the camel – have you seen a camel with glasses? He will stumble, fall down on the earth, he will not be able to make any sense of what is happening to his eyes. The monkeys cannot see beyond themselves.\nThose old people, even if they can understand a simple thing, that sannyasins are going to create a better earth, which they themselves have failed to do.… And they had enough time – thousands of years – and they have not been able to create love, beauty, grace. All that they have been able to do is just train you, and force you into being phony.\nI invite all the sannyasins of the world: slowly start moving to the closest commune. You will find a great rhythm between yourself and others. You will find for the first time a loving, compassionate, rejoicing group of people, who do not expect anything from you, but who are always ready to share with you whatever they have got.\nThen once in a while go to the old society just to show them that you have started flowering, just to make them aware that they need not be worried about you. You have found the holy land, Israel. And we are creating many Israels around the earth.\nBefore true love arises in you there will be a time gap. The time gap can be made smaller if you are living with other sannyasins. If you are really immersed in the commune, the gap can completely disappear. The moment you drop the false values imposed upon you, resentment also will disappear.\nAnd remember, when your resentment disappears, then for the first time you will be able to be loving towards your father, towards your mother, towards your brothers, sisters, towards your teachers – because you will have the understanding that whatsoever they did, there was no bad intention\nbehind it. They were simply doing to you what was done to them by their teachers, by their parents. You will have a deep compassion for them. You will have a new feeling arising in you, of love – and of sadness too, because those people have missed.\nThe day you can feel sad that your father and your mother have missed life, do you think you will be still angry against them? You will feel great love. Just go once in a while and share you love, share your song, share your dance. They will be surprised, and you will be surprised also. They will be surprised that this boy who has always been a troublemaker in the family has become so peaceful, so serene, just a silent lake full of lotus flowers.\nAnd you will be surprised that they are not treating you the way they used to treat you. In fact, you will see that they want to understand what has happened to you. You look so beautiful, you look a totally new being – what has happened? They would like to know, and they would desire, if it is possible, for them also to be in the same space you are in.\nBut if sannyasins go on living for small things – the salary, the position, the power in the old rotten society – there is every possibility Those dead corpses are many, too many, and you will be very\nalone. And when death is stinking all around you, there is every possibility you will become accustomed to it, just the way others are accustomed to think this is the only fragrance in the world – the stinking death, the sick, slave mind, souls chained by the past, hearts burdened with mountains that are millions of years old. It is very difficult for you to save yourself where everything is just a g rave.\nWhy live in a graveyard? Even if you are paid as a watchman for the graveyard, forget about that pay. Of course, you are great there – the only living being, and everybody is dead. You are almost a king – the watchman in a graveyard is almost a king. His whole empire nobody can go against him,\nnobody can move against him. He is whole and sole authority; he can do anything to anybody. He can change their names, he can change their gravestones.\nBut please, don’t enjoy such stupidities. Life is very valuable and very short. Move to the communes. Make new communes. If old communes are too big and cannot take you in, create new communes. These oases around the earth – which is completely a desert – will become the womb for the New Man to be born.\nAnd don’t be worried in the commune by people who start behavingbecause they always wanted to\nrebel against anything that has been forced upon them. If they start behaving a little wrongly, don’t be hard on them. Your hardness will not help them. Be soft, loving. Your love will cleanse them, and a natural growth of all that makes you the privileged beings in existence will arise of its own accord.\nWe don’t teach any discipline. People ask me, “You don’t teach any discipline – then how can five thousand people go on living together?” There is no need to teach discipline. All that is needed is that everybody should feel loved, respected, dignified – whatever he is doing.\nIn our commune whether you are the vice-chancellor of the university or just a driver makes no difference. These are functional things. One is serving the commune as a vice-chancellor, another is serving the commune as a driver. Both are necessary. Both are exactly dignified human beings.\nDon’t be worried about a few people being disrespectful towards me, because I have never come across a sannyasin who is disrespectful towards me. Perhaps I am blind, perhaps I don’t understand the language of disrespect? No, I am not blind. No, I do understand every kind of language.\nBut when I am respectful to you, how can you manage to be disrespectful to me? It is just impossible. If I love you so much, how can you manage not to love me? And I am not expecting it. I love you because I cannot do anything else, and I am grateful to you that you don’t refuse my love. That’s enough for me.\nBut this is bound to stir your heart – a new dimension opening. Your father was giving you gifts because you respected him; your mother was very favorable to you because you loved her. Between me and you there is nothing other than love.\nIt is happening for the first time in the history of man that a master declares himself as ordinary as you are, that a master wants to be just one amongst you. There is no desire in me to be holier than you, higher than you, better than you. How can you manage to disrespect me? If you can manage, manage. If you can manage to hate me, do it. Perhaps I deserve it. Perhaps that is the only way for you to get rid of the hate.\nEven the person who hates me relates with me emotionally, just like the person who loves me. They both are relating to me: one positively, one negatively. And this is such a small job, for me to change the negative into the positive. I can do it any day, so I never feel in a hurry and jump upon you to change; I wait. I wait for the change to come on its own, otherwise, something of resentment will remain – a thin layer maybe, somewhere.\nSo as far as I am concerned, be absolutely sure I have no complaint against any sannyasin – even against those sannyasins who have left sannyas. My love to them remains the same, my hope for them remains the same. I know perfectly well, sooner or later, they will have to come back, because they cannot exist with the dead, old society. Once they have tasted the juices of a living, new commune, they cannot mix with the old society. Where are they going to go? Santa Fe?\nIt is so simple, you can understand Those few sannyasins who have left me have all gathered in\nSanta Fe. Now I have to take care of two communes: your commune and the commune of the camels in Santa Fe. But those camels are going to come back home sooner or later. You should not have any resentment for those who have left. Freedom to me is the highest value; there is nothing higher than that.\nOut of freedom you have joined my caravan. Out of freedom, some day you feel to depart.\nI bless you exactly the same on both occasions. When you become a sannyasin I bless you, and when you drop sannyas I bless you – because sannyas does not matter. What matters is the respect, the dignity of a human being, and I cannot in any way hurt your dignity.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD. NOBODY EVER REACHED THAT MANY PEOPLE BEFORE. IS THERE ANY LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF YOUR DISCIPLES?\nFirst, correct your numbers. I don’t have four hundred thousand sannyasins. I have almost double that number: eight hundred thousand sannyasins. And there is no limit – we are going to take the whole earth! There is no limit. And this takeover is not political. Politicians should not be worried about it. This takeover is far deeper, far more significant; it is spiritual.\nThe reason why nobody before me in his lifetime has been able to reach so many people is simple: he was not open to all. He had a certain prejudice, a certain ideology, a certain program that he wanted to impose upon you. He could reach only those people who were ready for that kind of program.\nI don’t have any program. I am available to all. Whether you are a Jew, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian, or a communist does not make any difference, because I don’t have any program to enforce upon you. My work is just the opposite: I am deprogramming you.\nSo if you are a communist, my work is the same – I deprogram the communist, he is no longer communist. If you are a Jew, I deprogram the Jew – the process is the same, you are no longer a Jew. If you are a German, I deprogram you. It is a little hard, but on the other hand, when the deprogramming succeeds, the German proves to be the most reliable. He takes a little time, resists, but when he gives way he gives way totally.\nWhoever comes to me, I don’t give him any discipline that he has to live by: don’t smoke cigarettes, don’t drink alcohol, don’t look at somebody else’s wife with desire.\nI don’t know... how can you look at a beautiful woman without desire? It is insulting to the woman, it is against her human dignity. A woman, a beautiful woman, should be desired. The more she is desired, the more people look at her with desire, the more beautiful she becomes, the more contented she becomes.\nI don’t see that anything that all old, stupid religions have been telling you will prevent you from reaching God. In the first place there is no God to reach, so don’t be worried about it. You are not going anywhere – to any God, to any paradise.\nSecondly, I have not experienced that anything – alcohol, cigars, gambling, love affairs – anything that all the religions have been prohibiting can prevent your becoming enlightened. You can perfectly become enlightened, there is no need to sit under a bo tree.\nYou can become enlightened with a Havana cigar, resting in your chair by the side of Patanjali lake, naked – there is no problem in it. How can a Havana cigar prevent enlightenment? I don’t see the arithmetic of it. It may perhaps help, but it cannot prevent.\nIt may help you to relax. It may help you just to be in the moment – naked, by the side of Patanjali Lake, enjoying the fresh air. A little champagne, may help you to be more meditative, because it will help you to get rid of other worries: that you have a wife, a nagging wife, that you have a husband who is just an idiot. Just a little champagne will take you away from all these ideas.\nThat’s why I have been able to reach eight hundred thousand people around the world. And these are the sannyasins. There are millions more who are just on the borderline; any moment they can become sannyasins. There are many more who may never become sannyasins, but feel that they are cowards, feel that this is the right thing to do. Perhaps in their next life they may become sannyasins.\nWe are going to take over the world in a spiritual sense. We are not interested in taking over governments, nations. We are interested in destroying nations, governments – there is no need of all this paraphernalia! What is the need of a president? Yes, if there are nations, then presidents are needed, premiers are needed, commanders in chief are needed, an army is needed, nuclear weapons are needed.\nI don’t see that these things are needed to make humanity happier, more comfortable, more lovable, more dignified, more free. I don’t see how these things can help; they have not helped for thousands of years. It is time that we take over the whole world spiritually, and dissolve all kinds of nonsense that have been torturing man, stopping his growth.\nThe world can live in so much peace, serenity My effort, in short, is not to take you to paradise, but\nto bring the paradise to you on this earth. It can be done, because I have done it for myself.\nI don’t think paradise can give anything more to me. In fact, I don’t want to go to paradise – if there is any paradise – because I don’t want to associate with those dead, ugly saints, ascetics, of all the religions. They will be there.\nIfit is only an “if,” there is no heaven, no hell, but if there is a hell I would like to go there, because\nthere I will find all the juicy people of the world, not dead bones, dry. I will find there Maupassant, Tolstoy, Byron, Van Gogh, Lautrec, Rabindranath, Nijinsky – the list is infinite. All the poets, all the musicians, all the dancers, all the lovers, all those who are creative will be in hell because they were not religious people. They were not ascetics, they enjoyed life to the fullest.\nNow, you cannot think of Byron in heaven. England had to expel him – do you think paradise will accept him? England had to expel him because he was a woman’s man. All the so-called ladies completely forgot that they were ladies. Byron was so beautiful, so charming, that any woman would have fallen in love with him, and hundreds of women did fall in love with him.\nIt is said that husbands became so much afraid – and you can imagine British husbands! – that if Byron entered a restaurant, husbands would take the hands of their wives and rush out from the other door. Finally they could not stand him anymore, he was creating so much nuisance. And he was doing nothing, he was just a loving being, non-possessive. They expelled him. The day he was expelled, even the ladies from the royalty were there to give him a send-off – thousands of women. Now, this man cannot enter heaven, that much is certain. And I would like to meet Byron; I see a potential sannyasin in him.\nOf course, I will be doing the same work in hell. If I can do this work on this earth, which is far worse than any hell, why can’t I do this work in hell? It will be easier there, because there is a better quality of people – intelligent people, creative people. They are just waiting for me to come. The moment you allow me to go, I will be with them. That is the company I would like to be associated with.\nCHAPTER 26\nEnlightenment is you completely gone\n24 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO\nSEEING THAT EVERYONE WANTS SO MUCH TO BE ENLIGHTENED, ISN’T ITALSOTRUE THAT WE ARE ALL SCARED TOO? WHAT IS THE FEAR THAT PREVENTS US FROM RELAXING INTO OUR OWN SELF?\nThere are many fears, not one.\nFirst, if you want to be enlightened, you have to die a psychological death. You have to be reborn as a new spiritual being, and you don’t know anything about spirituality. All that you know about yourself is your mind, centered around the ego.\nIt is a very strange phenomenon, that you are identified with something which you are not, and you have forgotten that which you are, have always been, will always be. There is no way to be anything else. Your being belongs to the existential. But there are layers and layers of conditioning – of parents, of teachers, of priests, of politicians. Between you, the real you, and you, the unreal you, there is a great line of people.\nAnd naturally, you loved your parents, they loved you. Whatsoever they have done to you is absolutely unconscious, it was not intentional. They never wanted you to be a hypocrite, but they have made you a hypocrite. I never suspect their intentions. Their intentions were to make you something great, but they are as unconscious as you are. Their parents have given them\ntheir unconsciousness as an inheritance; and this has been going on since Adam and Eve. Every generation goes on loading the coming generation with all kinds of rubbish, stupidity, superstitions.\nBut don’t be angry with them. You have heard about “the angry young man.” The angry young man is an idiot. Anger is not going to solve anything; it is going to make everything more difficult and more complicated. Your parents, your teachers, your neighbors don’t deserve anger; they deserve compassion. They could not do anything else. With all good wishes they have destroyed you, just the way their parents had destroyed them.\nAnd if you don’t become enlightened you are going to destroy your children. For their own sake, you are going to give them all kinds of crap.\nYou have been told you are a Christian, you are a Hindu, you are a Mohammedan. You came into the world as a tabula rasa; nothing was written on you. Your parents engraved on you and made you a Christian and forced the idea of Christianity on you, and they used your fear, your greed to implement it. You were made afraid of hell, you were made greedy for heaven. And of course, they wanted you not to fall into the ways of sin, but to follow the royal road of virtue.\nNothing was wrong in their intentions; their intentions are not in question. What is in question is that they were not conscious, that the seeds they were sowing in you were seeds of poison. No well- wishing, no good intentions are going to change those seeds. And once they have got roots in you it becomes more and more difficult to get rid of them, because you are identified with the tree of poisons.\nIt is difficult for a Christian to put Christianity aside. He will feel he is doing something like a betrayal. Putting aside Christianity he will feel he is betraying Jesus Christ. He is not betraying anyone. He is simply trying to get out of the mess of conditioning that all kinds of people have put upon him.\nMy grandmother – my mother’s mother – was a tremendously beautiful woman. She loved me so much that I was more in touch with her than with my own mother. I used to come to my mother’s house to eat twice a day, and then I went to the school. But every night I was in my grandmother’s house. She lived in the same town; when her husband died, she moved there. She was alone, there was no other child – my mother was her only child.\nBut she was of an independent character. Everybody tried to persuade her to live with my father’s family, but she said, “That is not possible. Not that I don’t love you and don’t want to live with you, but I want to be utterly independent, on my own.”\nSo she lived just a few houses away, so that my father and my mother could take care in any emergency – she was old. But I was sleeping every night at her house. She had all blessings for me.\nOne day when I was carrying her spiritual book of Jainism, it fell. She immediately fell on the earth and put her head at the imaginary feet of the religious book. I asked her, “What are you doing? A book is a book – religious or unreligious, it doesn’t matter. It is printed on the same kind of paper, with the same kind of ink, with the same kind of words.”\nShe was old, but very understanding. She said, “Perhaps you are right, but my whole life is involved. The religious book falling on the ground is not a good sign; we have to ask its forgiveness. It has to be on our heads, not at our feet.”\nI used to argue with her. I said, “The book is dead. Whether you put it on your head or you stand on it, it\nwill not know the difference.”\nShe was shocked, and at the same time she said, “What you are saying, I can see the point of it, but now it is too late. I am so old – now to start living from scratch, now to start thinking again from the very beginning is a great task. And it is not only a question of this book; so much is involved in it – my attitude towards the religion, my attitude towards the priests, the monks, my attitude towards my parents.\n“I got this mind as an inheritance, and it is all that I have. You can destroy it, but then I will feel empty. And when death is coming closer and I can hear the footsteps of death louder and louder, my son, it is too late. I don’t want to die empty.”\nThis is the fear. You are afraid of dropping any conditioning because that conditioning is giving you a certain personality. But you are not aware of that, so you are not worried about it. Your personality has taken the place of your individuality. And to throw away your personality – which means all your past, the whole of it; there is no question of choice.…\nIt is not a question that there are bad parts in it, throw them; and there are good parts in it, preserve them. Your whole past is imposed by others on you, so whether it is good or bad does not matter. The significant thing to remember is that it is not your discovery, it is all borrowed; it is secondhand, thirdhand – perhaps through millions of hands it has passed. It is really dirty. You have to get rid of it in its totality.\nThere will be a gap when you will feel completely lost. You used to know yourself, who you were. There will come a gap when you will not know who you are, but that is a beautiful experience, because your innocence is back again. You are born again; it is a rebirth. Now you can start discovering.\nThe whole territory is new, you have never been here before. You were kept going round and round on the circumference of your existence. It is adventurous, it is a great challenge. Fear arises. Fear arises because what you think you are is certainly in your hands. And the individuality I am talking about, you don’t have in your hands. You don’t know what you are going to discover, or whether there is anything to discover or not.\nThere is a proverb in many languages... similar proverbs: “Half a loaf of bread in the hand is better than the full loaf far away.” And I am asking you to drop the half loaf for something that is so far away from you right now. Fear is natural. It is nothing to be worried about, it just has to be understood.\nOne fundamental law of life: you were as alive – perhaps more alive – in your mother’s womb, but you were not a Christian. You had not yet heard of Jesus Christ, you were not carrying a Bible, you were not clinging to a cross. You had no idea what your name is, you had no ambition to become the president of America, to be the richest man in the world. You had no ambitions. Ambitions are extensions of your ego: the bigger the ambition, the bigger ego you are searching for.\nAt birth you were simply there. So one thing is certain, that whatever you have gained after your birth is not really a gain, it is a loss. On each step you have been losing the real and getting cluttered with the unreal, losing the precious and getting attached to some junk.\nIt is a question of understanding that even if you drop your whole past you are not going to die, because you were alive for nine months in your mother’s womb perfectly well. In fact, scientists say that during the nine months in the mother’s womb the child grows more, faster, than he will grow in his whole life of seventy years. He passes through so many phases; he passes through almost all the phases humanity has passed through. At a certain moment he looks like a monkey in the mother’s womb. Earlier than that, he looks like a fish.\nIt is now almost an agreed idea that man was born in the ocean as a fish, millions of years ago. All those millions of years, the child passes through in days. From the fish to the monkey is a long way; from the monkey to man is also not a short way.\nIn nine months he moves exactly, step by step, as the whole humanity has moved. He repeats the whole history. So it is absolutely clear that the way he grows in the mother’s womb... the speed is phenomenal. He will not grow that fast in a lifetime of seventy years. In fact, in those seventy years he will simply grow old. He will become less and less alive. In those seventy years he is moving towards his grave. He is not growing up, he is going down – down the drain. So there is no need to be afraid of being reborn.\nI can assure you only of one thing: there is no question of belief. You can see the point yourself, that without being a Christian, without being a Jew, without being a Hindu, without being a communist, you were perfectly alive and kicking.\nIn that innocence you have known the most wonderful experience ever.\nSigmund Freud has many beautiful insights. One of his insights is that everybody on the earth has some idea of a paradise. There is no culture, no civilization in the past, in the present, which has not had some kind of idea about a paradise. From where does this idea come?\nSigmund Freud’s insight is that this idea comes from the womb of the mother. Those nine months were of tremendous comfort, of absolute luxury. You had no responsibility, no burden on your head; you had no duty. You were not doing anything at all except living – and living alone! You were so full of life that there was no need for someone else to fulfill you.\nThose nine months in the mother’s womb you have forgotten consciously, but your unconscious remembers them. In deep hypnosis you can be made to remember that experience. That unconscious experience of the most beautiful life for nine months is the reason that people are searching for a paradise – the paradise they have lost.\nThat is the basic root of the story of Adam and Eve being thrown out of the garden of God. That story is not a historical truth, but it has a psychological insight. And around the world, in every religion, there is something similar to it: that there was a day when you lost contact with all that is beautiful, glorious. The story is simply symbolic. The child leaving the womb of the mother is really being thrown out of the Garden of Eden.\nNow begins a tedious journey – from the very beginning, painful. As he opens his eyes His eyes\nare very delicate: for nine months he has lived in darkness. There was no need for him to open his eyes, or even if he had opened them there was nothing to see. Now he opens his eyes – glaring lights; he starts being hurt.\nIn the mother’s womb he was not breathing for himself, it was the mother who was breathing for him.\nEven that much responsibility was not placed on him, that he has to breath for himself.\nThrown out of that beautiful space, he gets his first experience of the world. The doctor hangs him upside down, and hits him on his buttocks. A strange reception! And the child has no idea what is going to happen now. He is so small, everybody is so big. And this nazi behavior of the doctors.… Something better can be found. It is barbarous – of course it is done with all good intentions.\nThe doctor does it for two reasons. One, he hangs him upside down so any mucus that is inside his breathing passage comes out. Because he has not been breathing in his mother’s womb, there is mucus filling the tube that he has to use now. But in a scientific age we can find a better way to take the mucus out; it should not be done the way it is done. We have vacuum cleaners. Can’t we manage some vacuum cleaner for the poor child that takes out the mucus?\nAnd secondly, as the child is born, the cord that joins him with his mother’s womb is immediately cut. It is a shock, the greatest shock of your life, to be cut from your life source. You will have many shocks in the future, life will give you many troubles; but the child – who has known no shock, no trouble – is really hurt. It is almost murderous to cut the cord that joins him with the mother.\nBut the doctor does it with all good intentions – because if the cord is not cut the child may not learn how to breathe. But that is not a fact; the doctors have been in an unnecessary hurry. If the child is left on the mother’s belly – he was inside the belly for nine months – if he is left again on the mother’s belly just two minutes are needed. But to the doctor even two minutes seem to be too long. And he\nhas to deliver many other children; it is simply his profession.\nJust after two minutes, resting on his mother’s belly, the child starts breathing on his own. A little patience but who is patient? And after the child has started breathing on his own, then you can\ncut the cord and it will not be a shock. He has become an individual on his own.\nThe child should be given birth to in a very dim light – soft, soothing. And as soon as the child is able to breath on his own, the first thing should be to put him in a hot water tub because he has been, in his mother’s womb, floating in warm water that is constituted of exactly the same chemicals as sea water.\nSo man has come millions of years away from his first ancestors who were born in the ocean, but basically nothing has changed. Every child is born in the ocean even now. And women who have known pregnancy will be aware that when they are pregnant, suddenly they start hankering to eat salty things, because the child needs water as salty as the ocean.\nSo just a small, warm, salt-water bath, and the child will not feel shocked, will not feel expelled. The story of Adam and Eve will become absurd. The child will feel welcomed, entering a vast world of exploration. He will feel freedom from a confined space. And that kind of child will not be desirous\nof any paradise; his life will be a paradise. He will not hanker for and desire something after death because he lost something at birth which can be attained again only after death.\nWhy do your religions say that paradise is after death? It is simple – because your paradise was before birth. It is appealing, logical.\nI want you to remember that you have existed for nine months with great energy, growing tremendously – with such speed that in nine months you passed through millions of years. And you had no political ideology, you had no religious theology. You had not even a name. Nameless, religionless, without politics you have existed. So there is no need to fear.\nI can only make it clear to you that there is no need to fear. You can drop all that has been added to you after birth, still you will be living – not only living, but living abundantly. You need not wait for death. You can give death to your personality now, and be reborn.\nThat’s exactly what enlightenment is: the personality dies and the individuality which was repressed\nby the personality starts growing, flowering.\nBut your question raises one more question. Listening to me, or reading about the idea of enlightenment, you start being greedy for it. That’s where you miss from the very beginning. You say, “I want to be enlightened.” Wanting is a barrier. Who is this “I” that wants to be enlightened?\nThis “I” is your very ego, which is preventing you from being enlightened. Now this “I” which was trying to become a great leader of men, the richest person in the world, the most powerful president – of America or the Soviet Union – the same “I” gets a new idea to become even bigger than all these presidents and all these rich people – enlightenment. The ego says, “Great! I want to be enlightened.” The ego cannot be enlightened, just as darkness can not become light.\nListening to me, or getting the idea from somewhere else, remember: you cannot want to be enlightened. You can be enlightened, but you cannot want it, you cannot desire it. It is not some commodity that you can purchase. It is not some country that you can invade. It is not there – outside – that you can approach and find it. Enlightenment is the name of an inner experience in which both are involved: death of the personality and rebirth of the individuality.\nThe people in the monasteries around the world are desiring to be enlightened, to be awakened, to be liberated – so many words for the same experience. But they are just being stupid. They are, in fact, by desiring enlightenment, making enlightenment a commodity in the market.\nEnlightenment is not something to be desired.\nThen what has one to do? One has to understand one’s personality, layer by layer. Forget all about enlightenment, it has nothing to do with you. One thing is certain: you cannot be enlightened. Begin with what you are.\nJust as one peels an onion, peel your personality, layer by layer. Go on throwing those layers. New layers will be there, but finally a moment comes when the onion disappears and there is only emptiness in your hands. That moment is the moment of enlightenment. You cannot desire it,\nbecause desire adds another layer to your onion – and a far more dangerous layer than any other layer.\nBecoming a president is not such a big thing, any idiot can do it. In fact, idiots are doing it all around the world. Who else is interested in becoming a president or a prime minister? I have never seen any man of wisdom trying to become the president, the premier.\nHave you observed a strange fact, that in the past there have been a few kings who became enlightened? Ashoka in India became enlightened. He was one of the greatest emperors in the world – in fact, India has never been that big since him. Parts of India went on being invaded, becoming new countries. Today India is only one-third of what it was in Ashoka’s empire.\nThere have been other emperors in China, in Japan, in Greece who have become enlightened. An emperor is not one who has desired to become an emperor. Just as somebody is born a beggar, he is born an emperor. He takes it for granted; it does not become a layer of greed around his onion.\nBut we have never heard of any president, any prime minister becoming enlightened. It sounds strange, but the reason is clear. Presidents are not born, they have to struggle for it, they have to lie and promise – knowing perfectly well that these promises cannot be fulfilled. They have to be diplomatic, they can’t say what they want. They go on saying things, and they are never going to do them. The politician has to be very cunning.\nNo politician has been known to become enlightened, for the simple reason that in a democratic world, where monarchy has disappeared, to be the head of the state is one of the greatest desires of the ego. But the desire for enlightenment is the ultimate desire; you cannot desire anything bigger than that. You have asked for the ultimate bliss, you have asked for the ultimate existential wisdom.\nDon’t make enlightenment a desire; otherwise you will go on missing. What I suggest to you is, forget about enlightenment. It has nothing to do with you, you will never see it; it happens when you are not. When you have peeled the onion completely, when your ego evaporates, it is there. But you cannot say, “I have become enlightened.” The “I” is no more there – enlightenment is there.\nThe fear is natural, because you have to drop your whole personality, and that’s all you have got right now. You don’t know there is something behind it. You want to gain more, and I am saying to you to lose everything that makes you. That’s the fear. If you listen to the fear, then there is no hope.\nBut in fact, what have you got? Anxiety, anguish, boredom, despair, failure – thousands of complexes. This is your whole treasure. Just look at it! What is the fear in dropping this treasury, in getting rid of your anxiety, throwing away your boredom?\nBut things are really complicated. Why are you bored? And why can’t you get rid of it? There must be some vested interest in it. You are bored with your wife or your husband. Every wife and every husband are bound to come to a point when they are fed up with each other, bored. But there is a complication. You cannot just say goodbye to your wife. You have got children, you both love them, you don’t want to leave those children. There is going to be a fight in a court over who is to have the children; both can’t have them.\nYou have a certain prestige in the society. People think you are one of the model couples because they see you always showing love to each other. When you leave for the office you kiss your wife, when you come from the office you kiss your wife – as a ritual. Neither you mean anything nor she means anything, and you both know it. And while you are kissing your wife you are saying within yourself, “To hell with all this!”\nBut the people don’t hear what you are saying within yourself. They just see. “Thirty years of marriage, and still they are so loving, as if on their car the board is still hanging: Just married. Their honeymoon seems to be becoming longer and longer – thirty years of honeymoon!” There is no end to it. When you go in the society you pretend; you have to keep people’s idea of you as the best couple. These are your investments.\nPerhaps you are rich because you married a rich woman. If you drop her you will be a beggar again; you don’t want to do that. Perhaps you got a good employment because of your wife’s good looks – it is a very strange world – or your wife’s relations, influence. You may lose the job if you drop your wife.\nSo how to drop the boredom? – the boredom is connected with so many investments. It needs courage, great courage. And I would like to say to you that it is better to be a beggar but without boredom, far better than to be an emperor and bored, because boredom is spiritual begging. And it never comes alone. If you are bored there will be despair, there will be anxiety, a continuous tension in the mind: What to do? You have to go on living with a woman or a man you would like to kill – and you have to kiss them.\nTo drop boredom means to take a revolutionary step, whatever the cost; you are not going to drag through your life as a bored man, because what is the point of living? And you will see all around the world, everybody is bored. Somebody is bored with his work, his job. He never wanted to be a doctor, but his parents forced him to be a doctor because it is respectable, profit-making. You make the profit, you get the respect, and still you are called a great public servant, because you are serving humanity. It is really great!\nYour parents forced you to become a doctor. You hate it, you never wanted it; you wanted to become a painter. But nobody listened to you, they said, “You are crazy. If you want to be a painter you will die as a beggar on the street. Forget all about this nonsense. When one is young all kinds of romantic ideas come into the mind. Cool down, boy. We also have seen younger days, and we have also dreamed of great things, but now we know that all those romantic ideas are just a passing phase. If we allow you to become a painter, you will never forgive us! We cannot allow you to be a painter.”\nYou want to be a musician, a dancer, a sculptor, but nobody is going to support you. You wanted to be a dancer and you have become a businessman; you are bored with it. You really want one day to hang yourself from a tree and be finished with it all. But that too you cannot do because there is so much to do – you have to fill in your tax return forms, and the tax department is after you You don’t\nhave time to hang yourself.\nSo many things are unfinished around you. First you have to finish everything, then go and hang yourself. But things will always remain unfinished. And the idea of hanging yourself gives a little\nrelaxation, gives a certain pleasure that whatsoever the situation, there is always one exit: you can always hang yourself. So what is the hurry? And who knows? Tomorrow things may change, you may find the right woman.\nThere is no right woman, no right man, nobody has ever found one. But the fantasy of finding the right man, the right woman.… Every couple, when they fall in love for the first time, think they are made for each other: this is the woman he has dreamed of always. This is what the man, the woman, has been always thinking of, desiring. But by the time the honeymoon is over you know that you are caught with a wrong person; you are not made for each other.\nBut you go on fantasizing, “Perhaps some other woman?” – because the world is so full of women, so full of men. This time you missed, next time.…\nOne of my friends got married three times. It is difficult in India to get a divorce. Almost his whole life was wasted; women were the trouble. The law is not easy, but somehow he managed, because in India you can somehow manage everything. All that is needed is money, and he had money. You can bribe everybody. It is a national tradition and not new, very ancient.\nIndians have been bribing God, so what do they care about bribing a clerk or a judge? When the Indian goes to the temple and says to his god, “If I win this lottery, I will present you with sweets worth five rupees” or “I will give a feast to eleven brahmins,” what is this? And the lottery is one million rupees; with five rupees he is trying to get one million rupees! And for centuries Indians have been bribing God; it is their heritage. Nobody feels bad about it.\nYou can give a bribe to anybody – neither you feel bad about it nor he feels bad about it, because he is doing you work. It is almost payment for the work. And he is doing work which is far costlier than the bribe you are giving him. You manage everything. You can murder, and you will be released respectfully by the court; all that you need is money.\nSo one goes on thinking that tomorrow may be different. My friend changed wives three times, and he was always telling me, “This time I am not going to fall for a woman like the one I am getting rid of. She is a real bitch!”\nAnd I told him, “You will always fall in love with a real bitch.”\nHe said, “This is strange. You go on insisting, and the wonder is that you are always right! The next woman proved as bitchy as the first, the third woman proved as bitchy as the others. How do you predict?”\nI said, “I don’t predict, I am not an astrologer. I simply know you; what kind of woman will be appealing to you, that I know. Why had you fallen for the first woman? Have you thought, analyzed, what qualities of that woman have attracted you? And who is going to find the second woman for you? You will, again, and you will again be attracted to the same things.\n“You have not changed, your attractions have not changed. You have never bothered that you are responsible for having chosen that woman. That’s why three times you have got the same kind of commodity... again and again and again. It is not a question of divorce, it is not a question of changing women; it is a question of changing your mind.”\nBut people always try to dump things on others. You are in anxiety because your children are becoming hippies. Your girl is taking dope, your boy is doing everything that is wrong – long hair, beard, drugs, and he has dropped out of the university. You are in anxiety: What is going to happen? You are dumping your anxiety on the girl, on the boy, on the wife – anybody will do.\nDo you think if your boy was going perfectly straight, your girl was not getting pregnant before marriage, if they were not on drugs do you think you would have been without anxiety? I know many people whose daughters are following whatsoever they say, whose sons are doing their education the way the parents want – still they have anxiety over something else. They will find some other object to become worried about.\nIf you have children you are worried about your children. If you don’t have children you are worried why God has not given you children. It seems to be really a zoo of all kinds of animals, this world of ours.\nDropping the layers of your ego means that you are ready to commit a psychological suicide. I call it sannyas just to give it a good name, because if I call it suicide you will be more frightened. You have come here to be enlightened, not to commit suicide. But the reality is that unless you commit suicide there is no enlightenment. People want enlightenment, and they don’t want to drop anything, to lose anything.\nThe day I said, “Before I leave the world I would like to give my sannyasins rainbow-colored robes, there should be no need by that time for my sannyasins to wear red clothes” – immediately, the next day, people started reaching the commune’s office, saying, “We want sannyas, but we are not going to use red clothes, nor are we going to use the mala. Give us sannyas. Osho has said already that the red clothes or the mala are not sannyas.”\nMy secretary came to me and asked, “What to do? You go on creating trouble for us. In the first place, from where are we to get rainbow dresses? And people are understanding according to their mind. They are understanding that all the colors of the rainbow can be used – somebody in red, somebody in blue, somebody in green – the commune will be using all the colors. They have not understood what you were saying.” I was absolutely clear, but you managed to understand what you wanted.\nI received a few letters: “We are thinking of taking sannyas, but your idea of a rainbow-colored dress made us frightened, because in the past only buffoons, jokers in the circus, have used rainbow dresses. We don’t want to become laughingstocks. Red is perfectly good.”\nI told my secretary, “Tell these people, ‘Then why are you waiting, if red is perfectly good?’” It became good in comparison to the rainbow robe. It is not good in comparison to ordinary clothes that people wear, because in red clothes you will immediately attract attention, discrimination. People will not feel at ease with you. They will be hostile to you.\nI have asked my sannyasins to be in red clothes, with the mala, with the locket of my picture, just to see whether you can gather a little courage or not. If even this much courage is not possible then you cannot commit suicide, you cannot drop your ego.\nYou want enlightenment as you are. Now, that is impossible. You will have to chop out many things which have become almost identical with yourself. And that’s what I am doing continuously – hitting, hammering, shocking you. And I will go on doing everything possible that can shock you, hurt you, wound you because I want you to become aware that it is your ego that gets wounded, it is your ego that gets hurt.\nJust the other day I was saying I am going to start smoking Havana cigars while delivering the religious, spiritual discourse. Now many camels will start moving towards Santa Fe. “What kind of a master smokes Havana cigars?” Do you think you are going away because of my Havana cigars? No. It hurts your ego. You wanted a master nobody can say anything against. You wanted to be a disciple of a great master who has extraordinary powers, who changes water into wine.\nI also do miracles – I change wine into water. So if you see me drinking champagne, don’t be worried. The moment I touch it, it is water. But champagne by my side, and the camels will get troubled, will start looking at the map – where is Santa Fe? All the camels are going towards Santa Fe.\nIt is not my champagne, it is not my Havana cigars, it is not anything to do with me – it is your ego. This is a great conspiracy that has been going on between the disciples and the so-called masters all through history. The disciple feels his ego fulfilled because he has found the right master, who does not smoke Havana cigars, does not drink champagne. Both are controlling each other.\nThe master cannot do anything against the expectations of the disciples, because then he will lose disciples, and with fewer disciples you are a smaller master. It is a question of numbers; with more disciples you are a bigger master. A great number of disciples, and you are the greatest master in the world.\nSo he cannot lose camels; even if the camels never change, he is not going to do anything that will make the numbers become less. It is a politics of numbers. And, of course, because he fasts, he can force his disciples to fast.\nI cannot. I do not fast. In fact, I cannot go to sleep in the night unless I have eaten Indian sweets – against my doctors’ advice. I have told them, “It is your business to figure it out. Diabetes I give to you, you figure it out.” But I cannot go to sleep.… My grandmother used to keep the sweets that I liked by my bedside, because in the middle of the night I might wake up. Then to go to sleep again needs sweets; otherwise I cannot.\nYou want a master who fulfills your ego, but you don’t know – the man who fulfills your ego, who is in tune with your expectations, is your enemy; he is not your master. The sooner you get rid of such a man, the better. But no, if a master goes on a fast for twenty-one days every year he will gather many people around him who will say, “This is the man. It is worth being a disciple of this man.” And what has he done? He has just been hungry, starving, for twenty-one days.\nWhy don’t you go to Ethiopia? You will find great masters who are fasting unto death – not twentyone days, because nobody dies after twenty-one days of fasting. It takes ninety days for a man to die by fasting.\nBut you are not aware of the conspiracy. The man who fasts for twenty-one days becomes authoritative, more powerful than you. He demands that you at least fast for three days, and you cannot say to him that he is asking too much. He is fasting for twenty-one days, and he asks you only to fast for three days. He is perfectly authorized to ask it. He is celibate, he asks you to be celibate. He eats only one time a day, he demands you also eat one time a day.\nDo you see the mutual conspiracy? You feel you are the disciple of a great master– of course you are a great disciple as a consequence: a simple arithmetic. Great masters have only great disciples, but those masters are fulfilling their egos, and they are fulfilling your egos. No transformation is possible in such a conspiracy.\nI don’t give you any discipline. I don’t command you to do certain things and not to do certain things, for the simple reason... who am I? I have no authority over you.\nI look at you as my friends. If you think about me as your master, that is your generosity. But it is not required by me. This way I remain free from your expectations, and I keep you free from my expectations. In this way I am not trying to fulfill my ego, and I am trying in every possible way to destroy your ego the way I destroyed mine.\nIt is a difficult task. Fear is bound to be there, but to act according to your fear is to degrade yourself even from camelhood. You become a monkey, or a donkey, or finally a Yankee. Perhaps you are there already, at the stage called Yankee.\nI will accept you at any stage. I will not demand that you become something else, something more, something bigger, something holier, something spiritual. No, all those are games of the same ego we want to get rid of.\nDon’t follow your fear instinct, because that is going to make you a coward. It degrades your humanity. It is a humiliation imposed by yourself. Whenever you see some fear, go against it! A simple criterion: whenever you see there is fear, go against it and you will be always moving, growing, expanding, coming closer to the moment when ego simply drops – because its whole functioning is through fear. And the absence of the ego is enlightenment; it is not something plus.\nEnlightenment is not something plus added to you. Enlightenment is you completely one.\nIt is minus phenomenon; you are no longer there. It does not happen to you, it happens when you are\nno longer hindering it, when you are not. That’s why I call enlightenment a psychological suicide.\nCHAPTER 27\nChase the woman gently\n25 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE NOTICED THAT THE WOMEN HERE ARE BECOMING JUICIER AND MORE ACTIVE, WHILE WE MEN ARE BECOMING LAZIER AND LAZIER. WOULD YOU COMMENT?\nThe women is not the weaker sex, as it has been said by man for centuries. The woman is the stronger sex. She is made weaker. For centuries upon centuries she has been conditioned; she has been told she needs a protector.\nThe Indian scripture of Manu, which has dominated the Hindu mind for five thousand years and still dominates it, says that when the woman is a child she should be dependent on the parents, protected by the parents. When she is young, she should be dependent on the husband and protected by the husband. When she is old, she should still remain dependent – on the boys, her children, and be protected by her own children. For her whole life she has to be protected by somebody. If for thousands of years you protect somebody in this way, you are bound to create weakness, dependence, fear.\nAnd it has been almost accepted as a scientific fact that man is the stronger sex. It is absolutely wrong! The woman is the stronger sex, and she has to be, because she has to produce children. She has to be pregnant and go through all the troubles of pregnancy.\nNot a single man could stand one pregnancy. Just think of yourself being pregnant for nine months: You cannot eat, you vomit; you go on carrying a weight which is growing bigger and bigger within\nyour belly. And then the final stage, the baby comes out of you. The passage is so small, the baby is big; it is painful. The woman passes almost through death when the child is born. And you think she is weaker than man?\nWomen live longer than men all over the world; the difference is of five years. If man lives on average seventy years, the woman lives on average seventy-five years. Strange, the weaker sex lives longer.\nMan is more prone to sicknesses, diseases, infections, than woman. And the difference is not small, it is double. Women are prone to sickness in comparison to man just half as much; if they get sick, it is only fifty percent as often. If man has to be considered, he gets sick and is available to any infection twice as often as women, and more.\nWhat is the cause of it? The woman has more resistance power. The man is very weak against small bugs – and yet he becomes Muhammad Ali the great! He cannot fight small bugs, he is incapable of doing any boxing against them. But the woman does.\nIt is a very strange thing that the suicide rate of the man is double that of the woman – and woman is the weaker sex? She suffers more, her whole life in the past has been of suffering. Women have been treated like cattle.\nIn China for thousands of years the woman has not been believed to have a soul. So if the husband murders his wife, he commits no crime. The woman was a possession. Without a soul, so much resistance against diseases? And man has a soul, but the resistance is only half that which a woman has.\nThe man becomes frantic very soon, carries thousands of worries in his head, is almost on the verge of falling into anxiety, anguish, suicide. It starts even in the mother’s womb.\nAn experienced woman who has given birth to one or two children can tell whether the child in her womb is male or female. How can she guess it? Very simple guesswork, which is absolutely certain. The boy starts kicking in her womb; the girl is calm and quiet. And the mother can feel that difference. The boy is becoming tense, worried already, already trying to learn boxing. The girl is very silent in the mother’s womb – creates no movement, is more stable, more centered, more grounded.\nWomen threaten that they will commit suicide, but they do not do it. The difference is again the same: men commit suicide twice as often as women do. And it has to be understood that their suicides are also different. The woman commits suicide because the man forces her to commit suicide. Man commits suicide because of his own anguish, worry, despair.\nIf the woman were not forced by man to commit suicide, no woman would commit suicide. In fact, the woman’s suicide is really a murder – murder by the man: man’s society, man’s rule, man’s power. And the woman has survived all along without any complaint. That is strength. Man forcing the woman to commit suicide should be punished – it is a murder. But behind the word suicide he is completely free of any crime.\nYour question is that women are becoming juicier here every day. They would become juicier all around the earth every day; they just have to be given the opportunity. It is their intrinsic nature to\nbe juicier. The woman has to nourish the child – she needs the juice. The woman attracts the male –\nshe has to be juicier. She is certainly more beautiful, more proportionate; her body is an artwork.\nI do not believe in the bogus Christian story that God created man first. The story must have been created by a man, because what use is man? And then he created the woman, taking a rib out of the man. This is simply to insult women: “You are nothing but a rib taken out of man. You are not human beings”.\nIf I have to write the story, I will say God first created Eve, not Adam – because the woman is creative, she is going to give birth. In fact, there was no need for Adam to be created by God. The story is, that God made love to the first woman he made. If that is true, then Adam is simply superfluous. The woman, and God making love to the woman... Adams will follow of their own accord. Adam need not be created, he will be born. But you need the woman first. Without her there is no possibility of anything getting born.\nBut for thousands of years, if you go on hammering the idea that woman is a weaker sex The\nwoman has shrunk, she has accepted the idea. She has lived according to the male chauvinist’s\nphilosophy.\nHere in this commune it is totally different. The woman finds herself absolutely free from all the jargon that man has been teaching her. And we have given all the opportunities to women that no society anywhere has been able to give them. All societies have taken away opportunities – and things need opportunities to grow, to reach to their potential.\nThe woman has somehow survived because she is so strong. But she has only survived – no nourishment. Here she is nourished, here she knows she is accepted on an equal basis. In fact, the women in the commune have more responsible posts than men. This is just a compensation – small, but it may become the model for the whole universe. And they are running the commune better than any society run by men.\nIn four years of the commune’s existence there has not been a single crime, not a single murder, not a single suicide. Man has not been able to create a society where crimes are not growing. And as the woman becomes juicier, more powerful, stronger, takes her natural position, the man is bound to become lazier. That is his nature – he is bone lazy.\nI have been in a few aboriginal communities in India. They are very primitive people; they live in the mountains, in the jungles. Somehow they are free form the stupidity the whole humanity lives under. Their small, primitive communities are matriarchal, not patriarchal. The woman rules, the woman is powerful. But I saw men almost shrunken, lazy, doing nothing. I was surprised. What happened to the strong sex?\nThe strong sex – the so-called strong sex – seeing that the woman is doing perfectly well, better that he can do, has done only one thing: he has married four, five women, and he sits in the house in the rocking chair, smoking, looking after the children. The woman works for everything – for food, for clothing, for all the necessities of life. Man’s work has become confined just to looking after the children – which is not much of a job.\nThe woman takes all the responsibility of the outside world – farming the land, growing the gardens, weaving the clothes. And she also is responsible for the household: making food, making the house comfortable – and the man simply goes on becoming lazier and stupider. I would not like it to happen here. It is ugly.\nMan should take the challenge. If women are becoming juicier, now is the time to prove And as far\nas laziness is concerned, I alone am enough. I am ready to take all your laziness upon myself. But remember that you have been for centuries lying, befooling. This is a great opportunity to prove that you are stronger – but every man deep down knows he is not.\nEvery man feels a deep inferiority complex, for the simple reason that he cannot produce children, he cannot give birth to life. His function in giving birth to children is only that of an injection. Any injection can do that. In fact, in the future, injections will be doing that; then man will be completely out of a job.\nDon’t be lazy... because it is easier to be lazy. Seeing that everything is going perfectly well, and women are doing perfectly well, the natural instinct is to fall into laziness; there is no need for you to do anything. But this is a wrong way of thinking. When women are doing so much, at least you have to prove your equality. You cannot prove that you are superior – forget it, that is completely out of the question – but you can at least prove yourself equal.\nI know you cannot produce children. That inferiority in you is to be used as another opportunity. Down the centuries man has been using that, and you are not to forget it. Man has created great music, great art, great poetry, great drama, great sculpture. Women have not done anything.\nIn the first place they were not allowed. In the second place, to give birth to a child, a living child, is such a great creative act that they don’t feel they have to make a dead statue. Leonardo da Vinci may make beautiful statue of Jesus Christ, but it does not breathe. Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, is far superior. Howsoever beautiful the statue, it is just a dead stone. Jesus was an alive human being. So the woman has no inferiority complex in her.\nI would like you to be creative. Man has to prove his equality, and he can prove his equality only by creating. And there is so much to create! We are in a desert, and we have to create a lush, green oasis. We are surrounded by all kind of hostile forces. We have to be strong enough to face them.\nIt is a great encounter between the past and the future. We have to stand for the future; they are standing for the past. Those who stand for the past miss the present. Those who stand for the future have to take care of the present, because the present is going to become the future.\nDon’t get lazy because women are doing perfectly well, taking all the responsible jobs in the commune. Gather yourself together, take responsibility. Of course you cannot give birth to a child – there is no need – but you can give birth to many things which the woman may not be attracted to. Yes, beautiful paintings are needed, beautiful gardens are needed, beautiful lakes are needed; beautiful music, poetry, literature, are needed.\nPerhaps the woman may not feel attracted. She is already a creator, a born creator. Man is not a born creator. Unless you make the effort to be a creator – that is, to be a painter, or a gardener,\nor a farmer – you are bound to fall into laziness. And laziness is a slow death. You cannot live life abundantly if you are lazy; life needs strength, overflowing energy. You cannot even love, because you don’t have any juice to share. You are becoming a dry bone.\nI have been receiving letters from women sannyasins, asking, “What is happening? In the whole world, man chases the woman. Here we have to chase men – and they escape!” This is ugly. This is humiliating yourself – or have you become so lazy that you cannot even chase a woman? Do you want a rocking chair? The women can provide you with a rocking chair – so sit on the rocking chair. But you cannot even sit there, because women will be chasing you. They are full of juice and they want to share it, and it can be shared only with somebody who is equally overflowing.\nOur commune is proving something significant. It is proving that if women are given the opportunity, they will prove far superior to men.\nAnd if women are given the opportunity, the man will become lazier. They will not feel competent enough, so rather than joining in the race, it is safer for their egos to sit by the side of the road. But that is a kind of suicide. You have to take the challenge. Come out of your laziness! And you become juicier only when you are creative. That’s why poets, painters, musicians, are more juicy than others – even if they are creating third-rate music.\nThe music of the Beatles has not to be called music, it is sheer madness. You cannot put the Beatles in the same company with Mozart, Wagner, Tansen. What the Beatles are doing is just something monkeyish, and naturally their music is finished; the Beatles are past already. Mozart is going to live forever. As long as humanity is there, and intelligent people are there, he will be alive. The Beatles were finished within ten years – came like a wind, and went away.\nYou have to create something in which your inner potentiality becomes actualized, materialized. And then you will be surprised that the more you create, the juicier you become. Poets have always attracted beautiful women, painters have always attracted beautiful women. Any kind of creativity makes you juicier. The woman knows where the juice is; it is her natural instinct. And what is the point of falling in love with a lazy skeleton?\nSo stop escaping from women. Start chasing them, because it is absolutely unacceptable... for the simple reason that the natural phenomenon – not only in man, but all over in nature – is that the male chases the female, and the female tries to escape, although she does not want to escape. She goes very slowly, she goes on looking back. But it is a beautiful game of hide-and-seek. The woman, all over nature, is the one who hides. It is the man, the male who seeks. We cannot change nature, and if you try to change it you become something of a perversion. The game is so joyous.…\nChase the woman, because that gives her strength, recognition; that makes her feel she is attractive, beautiful, wanted. And that is a great need in the feminine psychology: to be wanted. Don’t take away something from my women here, because it is absolutely unnatural for them to chase men. It is unfeminine, it is not ladylike.\nI don’t know what this word “lady” means, but I figured out it means “a good lay.” I don’t know English, so I can manage my own meanings. Now, a good lay has to be chased. The good lay is not going to chase you, that will look unfeminine. Be a gentleman! And just as I think lady means a good lay, a gentleman means one who lays her gently. And you are chasing.…\nChase the woman gently. And let her feel one of her greatest needs: that she is needed. That will make her juicier. And chasing her, you will come out of your laziness, so it is just the right thing to do.\nIf any man is not chasing a woman he is betraying me! I have chased women my whole life – of course, very gently. And you guys here are trying to destroy the whole natural balance! A woman loves immensely to be chased, it is her inner necessity. Don’t deprive the woman of her most basic need.\nI was a lecturer in the university... just by coincidence I was sitting with the vice-chancellor – he had called me to discuss a few things about my behavior – and at that very moment a girl student came in. She was in tears.\nThe vice-chancellor asked her, “What is the matter?”\nShe said, “Look at these letters! A few boys go on continuously writing me love letters. They even throw pebbles at me. They are harassing me!”\nNaturally the vice-chancellor said, “You just name those people, they will be punished.”\nI said, “Wait. You don’t understand psychology. Let me take the case in hand. I am teaching psychology – you don’t know anything about it.” He was shocked that a lecturer should say that. But it was absolutely certain that he had no idea of psychology. He had been the chief justice of a high court.\nI said, “It is not a court. You know how to deal with criminals, but this is not a crime. In fact, if this woman receives no letters, if nobody pays any attention to her, nobody chases her, nobody throws pebbles at her, she will be in great despair.”\nThe girl was shocked, but her tears disappeared. I said to her, “Just look within yourself. Don’t you enjoy all those letters? Don’t you enjoy all those people chasing you? Are you not creating jealousy in the other girls of your class?”\nFor a moment she was dumb. Then she said, “Of course, perhaps you are right. Perhaps I had come with these letters to show to the vice-chancellor just to make it known that I am the most chased girl in the whole university.”\nI said, “You are intelligent, you have understood the point.” And I said to the vice-chancellor, “Never interfere in things which you don’t know about.”\nIt is an absolute need in feminine psychology, and it is a very complicated phenomenon. If she is not chased, she is in despair. That means she is worthless, nobody is paying attention to her, nobody writes love letters, nobody approaches her. Nobody tells her, in a roundabout way, that he loves her. She is waitingDon’t let my women wait!\nAnd out of despair a woman starts chasing men, because she sees time is passing – and time passes faster for the woman than it passes for the man. Because she is a beautiful flower, delicate\nin every way, her youth, her beauty will be soon gone. By the time she is forty-eight her menopause comes, and after that who bothers to chase her? She is in a hurry: youth will not be forever.\nA man can be loved even when he is old. This is strange. You will find many young girls falling in love with an old poet, who is older than their fathers, an old painter, an old musician – young girls. I know twenty-year-old girls were falling in love with Picasso. And it has been always so, never the reverse.\nI have never seen a young man falling in love with an old woman of seventy, eighty, ninety. And if any young man falls in love with a woman who is ninety, the motivation must be different. It must be money. The woman is just about to go into her grave – it is not difficult for a few days to pretend that he loves her, and then all her money is going to be his. But no young man is going to fall really in love with an old woman.\nThe woman’s beauty, youth, is a very fleeting phenomenon. So she becomes despairing, afraid; time is running out and these lazy guys are not chasing her! Now, don’t be so cruel, don’t be so unkind. Be human, compassionate.\nThis word “compassion” is composed of passion. To be compassionate means to be in love. Compassion is just a dimension of love. Passion is hasty, hectic, a little violent. Compassion is gentle, nice, understanding – but it is passion after all.\nIt has to be remembered that when a woman out of despair chases a man, the man is bound to escape because something unnatural is happening. When the woman chases you, it simply means she is an unwanted woman, nobody is chasing her. The woman chasing the man becomes unattractive. The man cannot take it: she is not a woman, she is a monster.\nThings are very much correlated. If women start chasing, men are bound to escape. The whole game has turned upside down. The chaser becomes the chased, and no man can love a woman who is chasing him. The very phenomenon of chasing makes the woman worthless, she is not a challenge. Man wants challenge. He wants to chase, he wants to be victorious. That’s why nature has arranged it in such a way that in all the animals, man included, the males should chase the females.\nGive great contentment to the woman. And don’t be worried that you will have to chase her to the very end of the earth. She is willing, she is just giving you a little more chance to chase her, so it becomes a more attractive challenge. And once you start burning with the challenge, the woman becomes almost a fairy, not of this world. Your burning desire for her makes her a dream girl. You dream of her, you think of her, you write poetry, you play on the guitar. It is perfectly good.\nAnd never be worried. She is not trying to escape you, she is just giving you a chance to chase. Take the challenge as a man, and soon she will allow you to be victorious. And that’s what the man desires: victory. But when a woman chases a man it is going to be defeat. If she catches hold of him, he is defeated. He will fall on his knees and beg her, “Please leave me, find someone else. I am not one to be defeated.”\nSo just understand the natural way of things, and don’t go against nature, because going against nature creates all sorts of problems. To be natural is to be unproblematic. And to be natural is so beautiful.\nTo be natural is so at ease, at home.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM ONE OF YOUR BLACK SANNYASINS. MY CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT IN AFRICA, MY FAMILY LIVES THERE. I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR TEN YEARS, AND I’VE PUT ASIDE MY QUESTIONS ABOUT AFRICA. NOW I FIND THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND AFRICA MAKES ME FEEL RAW AND SHAKY. I FEEL ASHAMED AS WELL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING? I AM GLAD THAT IT IS HAPPENING, BUT IT HURTS.\nYes. I am also glad that it is happening. Go through the process. Something in your mind is still thinking in terms of white and black.\nMy commune has nothing to do with white and black. My commune is open to all with equal respect. Just look at me. I am neither black nor white, but it does not give me any trouble. I simply enjoy it. Not being black, not being white, with one hand I can chase a black woman, with another hand I can chase a white woman.\nOf course, my ways of chasing are very subtle. I chase them sitting in my chair. I don’t have to do all kinds of gymnastics. I don’t have to take them to the cafe, to the restaurant, to the movie; I am simply sitting in my chair. But even if I look in their eyes, that is enough: cafes and restaurants and movies are nothing before it. Just waving my hand... and I see the woman becoming so happy. It makes me happy in return. And I have not done anything – just waved my hand!\nWhen I see you laughing, it is a nourishment to me. When I see you singing and dancing with me, I become healthier. What medicines cannot do for me, my people, rejoicing, do.\nFeel for everybody who is here. Don’t think in terms of you being black. Black is beautiful – it has its own beauty, just as the white color has its own beauty. The black color is not to be condemned; the black color and the black people have to be discovered and welcomed. They are stronger than white people. White husbands are always afraid of black servants, chauffeurs, for the simple reason that their wives might find them more attractive. And certainly they are more powerful sexually – they are more primitive!\nAnd they come from a world where only strong people can survive. Those who are weaker will not be able to take the sun of Africa; they will be finished.\nIn Tibet, for centuries there has been a tradition that when the child is born You cannot conceive\nwhat they do. They dip the child into ice-cold water nine times. A very strange thing! Nine children die; only one survives out of ten. But I know their reason. In Tibet, to survive you will need immense strength against the cold. It is icy cold all around. It is better to die in the very beginning, better to get out of the race. Otherwise, you will be continually sick, a burden on the society, on the parents, who are all poor, and you will carry a guilt within yourself your whole life – that you are of no use, worthless and unnecessarily existing like a parasite.\nIt looks cruel to dip the just-born child into ice-cold water, but I can see their point. It is better to retire from the very beginning, rather than suffer for seventy years. So only ten percent of children survive, ninety percent die in that ice-cold dipping. But those who survive are immensely strong.\nThe same is the situation in Africa. They have to be strong, the sun is too much. Their blackness is really a protection against the sun. Their strength has been always a point of jealousy in white people’s minds; in fact, the white man has always felt inferior. And just to destroy that inferiority within himself, he forced the black people to be inferior. He made them slaves, he sold them in the markets like a commodity. They were not given education, they were not economically free. They were always second-class citizens.\nEven now, in the twentieth century, in the most modern country of the world – in America – the blacks are still fighting for their rights, and they are not receiving them. But in my commune, which is ahead of time... in my commune it is the twenty-first century! We have left the twentieth century far behind. Here, every color is respected.\nYou say you have been with me for ten years. Not really, if you had been really with me for ten years it would be impossible for this question to arise in your mind. Yes, I have never talked about Africa, because nobody ever asked about Africa, nobody ever asked about the African people.\nI answer your questions; otherwise, I have nothing to say. I have found the answer, now no question arises in me.\nIf you want to drink out of my experience, you have to use your question as a bucket is used to draw water from a well. The well is not in any need of your bucket, he is perfectly contented. But he is happy to give you water, to fill your bucket, because he knows the more he gives, the more water – fresh, younger – flows in through hundreds of sources.\nThe same is my experience. You go on asking me and I will go on answering you. But if you don’t ask, there is absolute silence in me. There is no question that has arisen in thirty-two years. Once you have found the answer, how can questions arise? But you have questions; use them as buckets. I am available, infinitely happy to give you all that I have, because the more I give, the fuller I am.\nYou have been with me physically for ten years, but somewhere lurking in your mind the idea has remained that you are a black person. And the white people have conditioned you to think that you are inferior. Just now, because somebody in the press conference asked me about Africans – why they are not coming here – the shadow that has been always lurking somewhere in your unconscious came into your conscious immediately. And my answer may have helped to bring it up.\nThere is no other way to get rid of things. If you go on keeping them deep in your unconscious, you may be unaware of them but they are there and growing their roots deeper and deeper. Underneath your unconscious mind there is a collective unconscious mind – which is far bigger. Underneath your collective unconscious mind is the cosmic unconscious mind – which is as big as the whole universe. So the deeper you repress something, the more you are giving it chances to survive. Bring it into the conscious mind.\nIt is good that somebody asked the question, and you have become disturbed, shaky. Don’t repress\nit. Shake yourself perfectly well!\nThere used to be – there is still in some areas – a Christian sect called Shakers. I condemn their whole theology, but I accept their shaking. That’s what they used to do in their churches: they would shake themselves as strongly as possible till they fell on the ground. I call it Dynamic Meditation!\nThere has been another Christian sect which was even better; they are called Quakers. Shaking is a little bit gentle, but quaking is as if an earthquake is happening. And that’s what they used to do. I don’t accept anything of their theology, but shaking and quaking are perfectly useful methods.\nSo if you are shaking inside, bring it out. And what has shaken you? – I said a truth. And I cannot say anything else. That’s why I am against taking the oath in the courts. The oath in the courts means that if you don’t take the oath you are liable to lie. That is accepting that you are a lying person. I am against the oaths in the courts, for the simple reason that they are already giving the judgment, without you asserting a single word. They have already judged: “You will lie, so take the oath.”\nBut it is so stupid. If a person can lie, how can the oath prevent him? And particularly a person like me, who does not believe in God, who does not believe in heaven and hell – what oath can prevent me from lying? There is no fear of hell, there is no greed for heaven, and I don’t want to meet your bogus God. I am completely fulfilled in myself. The oath can make superstitious people afraid; the oath can make a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan afraid. The oath cannot make my people afraid – there is nothing to fear.\nI am simply saying the truth as I see it. That’s what has shaken you. But what can I do? If there are people who don’t listen to Mozart, is Mozart responsible for that? If there are people who cannot understand the paintings of Van Gogh, is Van Gogh responsible for it? To understand Van Gogh you will have to grow more sensitive, more aesthetic; you will have to understand the mind of a creative painter.\nJust the other day I saw a picture of Van Gogh’s painting. Why has this picture suddenly been published? Van Gogh was condemned for this same painting for his whole life, and even after his life. And now suddenly the painting has become the most important of Van Gogh’s paintings. I will have to tell you what the painting is and what happened.\nThe painting is of stars, but they are not the way you see them. They are more whirling, they are not static; they are more liquid than solid. Now who has seen a liquid star going round and round on its center? In Van Gogh’s time, science itself condemned it as only imaginary. But now physicists have discovered that the stars are actually as they are painted by Van Gogh; they are liquid and whirling, they are not solid, static.\nSomething almost miraculous... Van Gogh could see something that science had to wait for one hundred years to discover. And now they are all paying respect to the genius of the man, to his unimaginable intuitive forces. How did he manage to see stars the way they are? If you want to understand Van Gogh, you will have to raise your consciousness. You cannot appreciate Van Gogh just the way you are; there is a gap.\nIf Africans are not coming to me, it is not my fault. There is a big gap, they cannot understand me. Their problems are not spiritual – why should they come to me? Their problems are very material,\nmundane. They need food, they need water, clean water. They need medicine, they need hospitals, they need schools. They need all kinds of things; and I am not distributing things here.\nOnly those who have everything and still find themselves discontented, who have all kinds of power and still feel they are empty; those who have been educated in the great universities of the world – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Varanasi – and still they find, after all this long process of education, wasting one-third of their lives What have they got? A few papers certifying that they are an M.A., a\nPh.D., a D.Litt., but their ignorance remains the same after all this knowledgeability.\nThey have not become knowers, they don’t know even themselves. All these universities – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Varanasi – they all have failed them, they have deceived them. They have not been true to their promise. Out of the university they come full of knowledgeability, but with no experience of their own: all knowledge borrowed, but no experience authentically their own. These are the people who will be coming to me.\nAfricans, I am sad to say, cannot come. But I am not responsible for it. It is not a question of their being black, it is a question of their poverty, their slavery. And as far as religion is concerned, I am condemning all the religions, because I find them pseudo, not true; mythological, not existential. The Africans are not even at that stage where they have a pseudo religion. They are far away, back in the world when there was no religion, only magical rituals.\nI am condemning the religious people. What can I say to Africans who are five thousand years behind? They are still believing that a certain ritual can kill a man, that a certain ritual can save a man from dying, that a certain ritual can do miracles. There is such a gap! That’s why they are not coming to me. You are fortunate that you have come and you have been here with me for ten years.\nI don’t ever discriminate between the black people and the white people. To me, anybody who is trying to seek, search inwards.… Inside nobody is black and nobody is white. Inside there are no colors. Inside it is luminous whiteness. Remember, white is not a color, just as black is not a color. It is strange that we say black people, white people; both are colorless, in different ways.\nYou can see in the rainbow you will not find white and black. These two colors you will not find in\nthe rainbow; all other colors are there. Why is the rainbow not interested in white and black? –\nbecause they are not colors. Black simply means that all colors have been absorbed.\nYou have to understand a little bit of scientific fact. When you see something black, that means none of the sunrays falling on it are reflected back. It absorbs them, it does not let any sunray escape. White does just the opposite. It reflects all the rays, and all the colors together create the illusion of white.\nYou can try it. Just on your ceiling fan, instead of three blades, put seven blades. Paint each blade in different colors – paint on it all seven rainbow colors. Then put the fan on, and you will be surprised: when those blades start moving fast, you only see white; all those colors have disappeared.\nThe reflection of all colors is white; rejecting all the colors is white. Absorbing all sunrays is black. The black people had to be black because they had to absorb the sunrays; otherwise they would be too much, they would kill them. They had to create a device, a simple device – to be black. It is not\nvery costly, it is a very small amount of pigment. Things are becoming more and more costly, but still the black pigment is not more than half a dollar’s worth. But it protects them from being burned by the sun, because the black immediately absorbs sunrays.\nThe white cannot accept all the sunrays; that is also simple. The white races live in colder countries where the sunrays are not so strong. To survive they don’t need to be able to absorb all the sunrays. These are survival measures – don’t make politics out of them!\nAnd as far as your inside is concerned, there are no colors, just a luminosity, just pure light and utter silence. It is the same in the black, in the white, in the yellow, in the brown – it does not matter what kind of container you have, the content is the same.\nYou are fortunate, I say it again, to have been here for ten years. But do you remember anybody discriminating against you because you are black? In fact, I had to enquire who the questioner is, because I don’t see you as black and white; I simply see you as red people! My concern is with the red people.\nIt is good that you got disturbed. But it is not your responsibility. It is nobody’s responsibility, it just happens that the black people have not risen in consciousness, in intelligence. They have been struggling at the lowest level of survival.\nThe same is the situation in India. There was a time, twenty-five centuries ago when Gautam Buddha was alive, when the country was agog with arguments, philosophies, theologies. There were wandering masters all over the country discussing things of the beyond, searching for methods of meditation, contemplation, concentration. The country was not at the survival level; the country was perfectly happy, their basic needs were fulfilled. And when the basic needs are fulfilled, suddenly you find new needs of a higher order arising in you.\nDo you think a hungry man should come to me to ask about meditation? A hungry man will come to ask about bread and butter. And if I start talking about meditation to him, he will say, “First give me something to eat so that I can at least hear you, what you are saying.”\nIn India, there has been a great fall. After Gautam Buddha, India went down and down and down. Alexander the Great reached India three hundred years after Gautam Buddha, and after Alexander the Great, India became a constant target of invaders of all kinds, of all countries – whoever wanted to loot. India became a victim for two thousand years. It lost its glory, it lost its spiritual interest.\nI was there for seven years in Poona, and people were asking why Indians don’t come to me. When people from all over the world are coming, why are Indians not coming to me? Or even if they come, they are only few and far between, and they are all rich people who come.\nI said, “It is so simple. The whole of India is struggling at the lowest level, trying somehow to manage to survive.” When somebody is drowning in a river, do you think he will ask a question about meditation? He will say, “Save me! Take me out of the water!”\nYou can tell him, “The best way is meditation. Don’t be worried about the water, everybody has to die someday. Die meditatively. Celebrate! And I will participate in celebration from the bank. I will\ndance and sing and play on the guitar, and you die joyously.” That man is not going to forgive you. If somehow he comes out, he is going to break your guitar and your neck and teach you a lesson, that this is not the way to behave with a drowning man!\nIn India the poor people were not coming to me. Those who were coming were either the upper middle class people or the super-rich. But it is not my fault that Indians are poor. It is their own responsibility.\nWhat have Africans been doing for five thousand years? If Africa was not able to provide a higher standard of life, they should have moved. Who is preventing them? But they are clinging, just as in India the farmers go on clinging – and eighty percent of India consists of farmers. They go on clinging to their small pieces of land, which have been exploited by their crops for centuries: now the land doesn’t have anything to give. But they are clinging, starving.\nThe gap is big I can tell them how to bridge the gap, but there were two African journalists in the\nworld press conference, and I could see they could not understand what I was saying. And they were journalists, educated. In fact, they could not ask the question itself adequately.\nOne was standing in front of me, trying to make an effort to question me, but he was going in a strange round and round way. I could not see what he was trying to ask. And when I figured it out and I answered him, he did not listen – because my answer was finished and he was still standing there like a rock. Everybody else asked the question, received the answer, and immediately moved away to give place to somebody else. But this man was just standing there. He had not even enough intelligence to know that my answer was finished. He looked absolutely like an idiot.\nThe second African asked the question better than the first; it was perfectly clear. Perhaps he was preparing it, rehearsing it, cramming it, because I could see that he must have crammed the question. And I have reason to say that – because when I started answering him, he would not look at me. He was looking here, he was looking there. Except at me, he was looking everywhere. In fact, he was cramming, inside, the second question. He did not want to get disturbed by my answer – he might forget the second question.\nAs my answer was finished.… If you have to ask a second question, it has to be related to my answer. But his second question was absolutely unrelated to my answer. Now what can I do?\nYou ask, “Why are Africans not coming?” in such a way – as if I am responsible for the fact that they are not coming. They cannot. They are not even contemporaries, what to say about the twenty-first century? They are five thousand years old – stuck, fossilized.\nYou are certainly blessed to be here, and any idea of black, of Africa – I am going to hammer all those things out of you. It will be good if you drop them yourself, just to be compassionate to me.\nHammering is not for a lazy man like me – and I am not a blacksmith either!\nCHAPTER 28\nDeath never happens\n26 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nA MAN LIKE YOU COMES ALONG ONCE IN ETERNITY. WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND SAYING IS UNIQUE. I’M INDEED FORTUNATE TO BE HERE AND I MAY NEVER HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. YET EVERY MORNING I COME TO DISCOURSE, I FALL ASLEEP. AM I MISSING? SHOULD I ALSO GO AND JUMP IN KRISHNAMURTI LAKE?\nIt is just great – have a good sleep! Sleep is not contradictory to enlightenment. You will make history by becoming enlightened in your sleep. And there is no need to go to Krishnamurti Lake. I am here – your Krishnamurti Lake\nBut don’t say that what I am saying is unique. It is simply the truth. Anybody who is ready to relax in his ordinariness will realize it. And it is not that a man like me comes only once in an eternity. You all have the same potential.\nOnly men like me are born; there are no other kind. Just don’t try to become somebody. That’s why I am saying. Don’t call me unique; otherwise you will start unconsciously trying to become unique. And the moment you go on the trip of becoming, you are going far away from the truth that you are.\nJust be ordinary! It is beautiful and so relaxing. It is the most wondrous experience just to be nobody, not desiring to be somewhere else, not even thinking of the tomorrow.\nCan’t you see this very moment the bliss that is descending upon you? Can’t you feel the silence that is beating in your very heart?\nIt is here – and not unique, available to all. And it is not that you have to wait for an eternity, don’t find excuses. I am not going to let you go without experiencing it. It is not something to be given to you; you have it already. Just go on relaxing, sleeping.\nSometimes I feel like sleeping; I can manage both to sleep and talk. Perhaps a few times I fall asleep and just out of habit I go on talking – you can ask Vivek. Once in a while when she comes to wake me up, she cannot believe it – I am addressing you! But the trouble for the poor girl is, when I speak in my sleep I speak my mother tongue. But I have promised her next time I will remember to speak in English.\nLife in all its dimensions – awake or asleep – makes no difference to your enlightenment. So don’t find any excuse. These are excuses: that it happens only in an eternity, how can it happen to you? It happens only to unique people, how can it happen to you? I am trying my best to destroy these tricks of the mind, so that nobody who is a sannyasin leaves this world unenlightened!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nRECENTLY YOU SAID THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO BECOME ENLIGHTENED DIE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW YOU HAVE MANAGED TO STAY WITH US SO LONG? I AM SO GRATEFUL.\nReally I should be grateful to you. It is love for you, and the love that you go on pouring upon me that has helped me to remain with you. Love is a spiritual nourishment.\nThose who died after their enlightenment died because they thought they had found it and now there was no reason to live. When I found it, I said to myself, “Now there is every reason to live.” Before finding, there was no reason; I could have died easily. But after my finding it, my love would not let me die. I waited for you, and you started coming. I have not sent a message, not written a letter. Still, from faraway lands you started coming, as if you have always belonged to me.\nNow I am part of you, you are part of me. It is going to be very difficult for death to take me away from so many people, from your love: I am protected.\nLove is the antidote of death, not life.\nOrdinarily you think that life and death are contraries. No, death and love are the contraries. Now it is going to be a great strain on death. I should be grateful to you. I have not given anything to you, there is nothing to give. You have already got it. At the most I go on shaking you, shocking you, hitting you. Do you think that is giving?\nBut you have loved me – a man who does not deserve anybody’s love. I am immensely grateful to\nthe sannyasins. You are my life! If you are with me, there is no death. If you are not with me, then\nthis very moment I will be gone. It is your love which is keeping me breathing, living; it is your joy, your blissfulness, your songs, your dances.\nIn the night when I go to sleep, I tell death, “At least don’t disturb my morning. My people will be waiting to burst into singing.” I am alive because so many people would like me to be alive. Existence cannot go against so much love. Existence cannot do anything without the permission of so many people. Death has to wait!\nIt all depends on you. My work is done as far as I am concerned. There is nothing more to experience, nothing more to know. But I have become so much concerned with you that it does not matter that my work is finished; there are so many people who love me whose work is not finished. I have to live, to find ways and means to postpone death.\nAnd I am very stubborn. I have struggled with life, and I have been victorious. Death is a poor thing; if I can be victorious in life, I can easily keep death waiting outside the door. I will allow it in only when I see that you are awake, that your consciousness has arisen, that even if I am not here you will continue my work, you will go on spreading the fire around the world. But please, just to keep me alive don’t go on sleeping\nThere are so many – eight hundred thousand – sannyasins around the world. It is going to be a difficult task for death to take me away from my people. I am not alone, I have penetrated into your beings. I have dispersed myself into so many beings that it is almost impossible for death to collect me unless I help.\nDon’t just feel grateful. If you are grateful, it is good, but not enough. Become what you are, be what\nyou are. Let me rejoice! My only joy is to see somebody coming home.\nI will wait till eternity. You can go on and on befooling yourself, but remember – I am waiting, and I want you to be enlightened. I want it to become the most important historical fact in human existence, that thousands of people relax into their ordinariness and become enlightened. Yes, in the past it was so that after thousands of years one person may become enlightened. I don’t live in that bullock-cart age, I am a contemporary man. I want you to become enlightened with jet speed – and it is possible. I am not asking the impossible.\nYou have given so much to me. You go on giving so much to me.\nI wonder... what have I done? Where have I gone wrong? – that so many people for no reason go on pouring their love on one who deserves nothing. And your love goes on growing. As your love goes on growing, I become healthier and healthier.\nSoon I am going to dance with you! Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nHEARING YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE IN YOUR CHILDHOOD, I FEEL CONNECTED TO THAT, BECAUSE I DID THE SAME. I STRUGGLED HARD NOT TO BE REPRESSED, BUT SOMEHOW THEY GOT ME IN THE END. HALF-HEARTEDLY I COMPROMISED. WHY WAS YOUR REBELLION NOT DISTURBED BY ANYTHING?\nThe first thing to be remembered by all: never compare yourself with anybody, not even with me. Everybody is so different, and everybody passes through different phases, different paths. There is no similarity.\nDon’t deceive yourself by saying that you have been as rebellious as I was in my childhood. You were not rebellious, you were only reactionary. Yes, you fought against repression, but your fight was the fight of the ego.\nMy fight was not the fight of the ego. My family, my neighbors, my friends, my teachers, professors – it took a little time for them, but soon they realized that I was not struggling for my ego. Soon it became clear to them that my struggle had a totally different quality to it. I was struggling to find myself. I was struggling so that they could not create a false ego as a substitute for my self.\nYou say you have been struggling – but remember, your struggle was an ego fighting. That’s where you failed. Your ego became strong, and remember, even the strongest ego is prone to compromise. It can fight if that fulfills it; it can compromise if that fulfills it. Why did you compromise? What can the world do to you? At the most they can kill you. The rebel from the very beginning decides, “I would prefer to accept death but I will not compromise.”\nYou were not fighting, struggling, to destroy your ego. You were fighting to strengthen it, to make it more powerful. And then a moment came when you were powerful enough – now struggle was useless, unnecessary trouble; you could compromise. Your struggle has been reactionary and political; that’s why you failed.\nMy struggle was totally different. I was continuously watching that my rebellion remained pure, that it was not polluted by reaction.\nThey look alike. When you don’t follow an order from your father, your mother, it can be either reaction or rebellion. They look very similar; they are as far apart from each other as two things can be, but the appearance is very similar. And it is very easy to believe that you are a rebel. All reactionaries believe that they are rebellious spirits. In fact, that too fulfills their ego – that they are not ordinary people, they are rebellious people.\nReaction means your ego does not want to be dominated by anyone; on the contrary, you would like to dominate everybody. Once it becomes strong through struggle, once you are certain that now nobody can destroy your ego, you start compromising. There is no need to fight, you can manage things now through compromise – a far easier way. Compromise – the very word is not in my vocabulary.\nCompromise is ugly.\nRebellion is either/or, it never compromises.\nHow can truth compromise with lies? Either the truth has to prevail, or death. And when you have a small taste of truth, who cares about death? because that very small taste of truth makes you immortal. Deep down you know death is a fallacy: nobody dies, so what is the fear? At the most you can get a new body instead of the old. So far, so good. Getting rid of the old model and finding the fresh, new, latest model of the body – it is a beautiful experience.\nBut to see that death is a fallacy, it never really happens, you never die, nobody dies, nothing dies.… Yes it can change forms, but life is eternal. Compromise means you have become a strong ego. Now you do not need to struggle; now you can manage through compromise to get whatsoever you want. Once the ego is certain, then compromise is bound to happen.\nI have never compromised on anything with anybody, for the simple reason that I have made it plain to everybody who has come into my life: if you are true, I am with you; it is not a compromise. I am totally with you, I don’t make any conditions. But if I am true, you have to remember that you will have to be with me without any conditions.\nNeither I compromise with anybody, nor do I allow anybody else to compromise with me. I have never compromised and I have never allowed anybody to compromise with me. Compromise is not my game. This is possible only if you are not trying to strengthen your ego.\nFor ego, it makes no difference: struggle is okay if it is nourishment for the ego, compromise is okay if it is nourishment for the ego. The ego wants to remain – it can use any means. There is no question of deciding what is right, what is wrong. For the ego, anything that keeps it strong is right – might is right. So if you can get something through compromise, why should you bother to fight? Yes, if you cannot get it through compromise, you are ready to struggle, to fight, to do anything that you are capable of.\nThis must have been your situation – just look back. What I am saying, try to find out... be just a fair judge of your own past, because if you had been rebellious like me, I cannot conceive that there came a point where you compromised. In rebellion there never comes a point of compromise. Only in reaction is there a point of compromise.\nYour word “compromise” makes me absolutely certain what it was – not rebellion but reaction. You say, “In the end they got me.” Why? If you were so strong in the beginning, in the end you would have been even more strong, all the years of struggle would have sharpened your sword. But if in the end you compromise, that simply means now you have come to a higher position as far as ego is concerned. Now there is no fear; you can compromise and still go on becoming bigger and bigger as an ego.\nNothing came in my way. You are asking, “Why did this happen to you and not to me?” We were working from totally different standpoints. I was not reactionary; hence, even the people with whom I fought had tremendous love for me, they never became my enemies. I fought with my father, I fought with my mother, but they both became sannyasins. It is a rare phenomenon. They knew that I was not fighting with them for my ego. Just the contrary: I was fighting so that they should not be able to create an ego in me.\nI received their blessings always. It looks very strange that the people with whom I was fighting were always blessing me. What was the cause of it? They could see clearly that I was absolutely simple\nand humble. I was not trying my ego against their ego. My teachers loved me. My professors wept when I left the university. The same professors who were continually bothered by me, they wept.\nI asked them, “What is the matter? You should be happy that you are getting rid of a great nuisance.” They said, “We will miss you.”\nOne of my professors, S.S. Roy, said to me, “I don’t expect to get another student of your type. For two years you have argued against me, but I could see that your argument was not an ego trip. You were sincerely searching for the truth. Students will come,” he said. “I had students in the past; I will have students in the future. But I do not see that I will have a student like you, whose effort is not just to pass examinations, get degrees – in fact who is not interested in the examinations, not interested in the degrees, not interested in the gold medals – but is sincerely interested in knowing the truth about everything.”\nNobody with whom I have struggled has ended in enmity with me. They all loved me, they still love me.\nProfessor S.S. Roy, with whom I fought the most, was one of the most intelligent people I have come across, and it was a joy to argue with him. Our arguments were never finished in the class, so I had to follow him to his home. By and by, his wife also became involved. And S.S.Roy said to his wife, “This is strange, you always seem to be on his side. He is enough! If you want to support somebody, support me! He will kill the arguments of both of us.”\nHis wife said, “But he’s so true and so sincere – not interested in defeating you. You are interested in defeating him. I have been watching the scene continuously. He is trying to figure out what is the truth, and you are trying somehow to prove that your argument is right. I am going to be on his side. And if you have guts. you should also be on his side.”\nS.S.Roy told me later on, “This is the first time my wife has been so strong. It must be your doing. She has adored me always, she has believed me to be one of the most intelligent people in the world. You destroyed everything. Now she thinks you are far better.”\nI asked S.S.Roy, “What do you think?” He said, “My wife is right.”\nHe is still alive. Anybody who is my sannyasin is received in his home in Allahabad with the same respect that he would give to me, with the same love. One of my sannyasins who lived in Allahabad said, “It is strange. He is a retired head of the department of philosophy of Allahabad University” – in India, Allahabad University has the best philosophical department – “and he is a dignified old man. But whenever I go to him, he simply asks, ‘Have you received any new book, new magazine? Just say something to me, what is he doing now?’”\nHe is one of those rare people who can respect somebody who is not in any way equal to him. I was just a student; he was the head of the department and the dean of the faculty of arts – one of the most dignified persons in the university. He had every chance to become the vice-chancellor, he just\ndid not want to become the vice-chancellor – for the simple reason, he said, “It is enough. I have always wanted to retire and relax and do something that one of my students has been continuously hammering on my head: meditate. Now I am old and I don’t want to waste time in being the vice- chancellor.”\nRetired, he is doing my meditations. And once in a while somebody will come and tell me, “He has a picture of you in his room where he meditates. His wife thinks now he has gone crazy – doing dynamic meditation in his old age.”\nRevolution – reaction – and rebellion have a totally different flavor. Reaction is ugly. You simply react because you don’t want anybody to have the upper hand. But one day when you find you can have the upper hand without struggle, you start compromising; that’s why those people could get you in the end. It was your basic misunderstanding. Your reaction, your ego, helped you to fall into the trap.\nI have never reacted to anything, I have rebelled against everything, and on the path of rebellion there is no compromise. Compromise is something Jewish! It is something that happens in the marketplace, in politics. It does not happen in the search for truth.\nBut nothing is lost. Get out of your compromises. Forget the past. Even if there is only one single moment available, one can drop the whole past and taste the beauty of rebellion. Just a single moment is needed, a moment of understanding, insight.\nI am not just answering your questions, I am trying to help you to get an insight. And then your insight will show you the path. In India, we call that insight the third eye. I am trying somehow... please open your third eye, so you can see clearly and straight.\nIt is a miracle to see something clearly. And if you find it is wrong there is no need to make any effort to drop it. Just in your seeing that it is wrong, your grip on it is finished, the thing drops out of your life of its own accord. It is miraculous. It is not that you become alert, aware, conscious, and then you have to drop this, stop that, do this, not do that – no. The moment you have the insight, that which is wrong falls away from you, that which is right you simply follow – no effort.\nInsight is a miracle, it is magical.\nSo my answers are not just answers. My answers are really an effort to approach your third eye, and somehow make you aware. The moment you see it was a reaction, not rebellion, you are finished with it. The moment you see you compromised because you found now it is helpful to the ego, your compromise is finished. You come out of this imprisonment of your ego fresh, young, to start your life from the very first moment – as if you are born again.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nAFTER YOUR DISCOURSE ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN, I FELT THAT THE MEN ARE AFRAID. THEY ARE SAYING, TO REASSURE THEMSELVES, “LET’S WAIT TILL TOMORROW. OSHO WILL PROBABLY SAY THE EXACT OPPOSITE.” COULD YOU COMMENT?\nI am not going to say anything that will be opposite, for the simple reason that what I said yesterday was not my opinion, it is the law of nature. If it was my opinion I could have said something opposite to it.\nSo please don’t wait– don’t wait uselessly. It is a law of nature. I cannot say anything against it. Start chasing the woman! Don’t waste your time waiting, thinking perhaps I will say the very opposite, that the women have to chase men. Impossible! I contradict myself, but I cannot contradict existence.\nI am perfectly a master of my own opinions, to keep them or to throw them out. But the law of existence can only be understood; you cannot add anything to it, you cannot deduct anything from it. And what I said yesterday was simply the law of nature: the feminine has to be chased. It is manly to chase the woman. To be chased by a woman is ugly.\nYou are not man enough! Woman are chasing you and you are escaping. It simply does not look graceful. On your part it is humiliation; on the part of the woman it is unnatural, ungraceful.\nBut why is it happening, that men are afraid? The reason is simple. In the ordinary society outside they are not afraid, they are chasing women because it is so difficult. The law is against it, their own wife, if she finds out, will kill them. The woman they are chasing is somebody else’s wife – if he finds out, he will start cleaning his gun! It is difficult. Monogamy has made it very attractive to chase women.\nThis society, this commune is completely free from all rubbish of monogamy, of husbands, of wives; it is completely free. That’s the trouble. In monogamy you are stuck with one woman, fed up with the woman; you start chasing another woman. Here the situation is different. Having a few love affairs New sannyasins chase, then after having a few love affairs, they feel spent, finished. Now\nthey cannot fantasize a woman in their dreams. In their dreams women disappear. Now, on the contrary, they are afraid.\nAnd you should remember one thing: that man is the weaker sex. A woman can have multiple orgasms, can make love many times in one night; the man is very poor, he can have only one orgasm. And the very phenomenon of lovemaking is such that the man loses energy in it, the woman is nourished. She does not lose energy in it, she is the gainer. And if a man knows many women, sooner or later he becomes aware that these women are killing him. Now he is not interested in women, he is interested in saving his life!\nSo please, be kind to poor men. They will not be afraid if lovemaking is not forced on them. They will enjoy cuddling you, they will enjoy the warmth only a feminine body releases; they will be nourished by it. But if they know that the woman is bent upon having sexual intercourse, any intelligent man will be afraid, because tomorrow he has to wake up and work twelve hours again. And he cannot manage so many women. Once in a while he may like to make love.…\nSo leave men the freedom. When they want to make love to you, enjoy it. When they want just to lie down by your side, being nourished by your feminine energy, your warmth, enjoy it. Don’t force them to go into sexual gymnastics. Then they will not be afraid if they are certain that when they have the energy they will make love and when they don’t have the energy they will get warmth, love showered on them by the woman.\nThis has to be understood, because it is going to be a problem. The woman has to be a little more understanding. And sexual intercourse is a very ordinary thing – all the animals are doing it. It needs no intelligence. If you have intelligence – and you are supposed to have intelligence – then just be compassionate to the poor man.\nAnd the man has also to understand, because for centuries he has been told that he is the stronger sex – that is absolutely wrong – so he tries to prove that he is the stronger sex. The moment he gets a woman, or a women gets him, which is far more likely, immediately he is ready to make love, to prove that he is a strong man. If he does not make love to the woman, what will the woman think of him?\nForget this nonsense. If your body, if your energy is not ready to overflow, just be with the woman, hold her hand, hug her. She will understand. You are the weaker sex; once you accept the fact, there is no trouble.\nJust look at me. I am only fifty-four and I look so ancient. Do you know the reason? I went on chasing women all my life! They made me ancient. What has happened to me, please don’t force on my sannyasins. Be loving to them, and they will be available, they will not be afraid. They will not escape and chicken out. They will be immensely happy to be with any woman who offers her love, her energy, her beauty. But the problem is sex.\nNever force sex on a man, leave it up to him. If he feels that he has energy for it, he is free to make love. But if he feels he is tired and would like simply to be showered with feminine energy, then help him. He is a weaker sex. Don’t be hard on the poor man.\nJust look at my white beard. This is what all the women have done to me. But I am the type of man who is never afraid. I said, “Even if I live twenty years less, it does not matter; I am not going to disappoint a woman.”\nFor a few weeks I have been celibate, that does not mean I have taken a vow to remain celibate forever. I can take holidays once in a while. It is nothing spiritual with me.\nCelibacy is every man’s birthright. He needs to gather energy. As he becomes older, he needs longer periods to gather energy. When a man is young – I mean, when he is between fourteen and twenty- one – he has the greatest energy he will have ever in his life. And this society is so ugly; that is the time when he is not allowed. At that time, in one night he can make three women, four women, satisfied. But the society does not allow him. They teach him that he should remain celibate. They have spread such stupid nonsense about it – that if you are not celibate you will go crazy, you will become mad.\nBy the time he is back home from the university he is already on the decline. Twenty-five to thirty-five – between these ten tears he will be declining, he will not have the same energy that he had before. And after thirty-five it is a very steep fall.\nAfter fifty he should not go on pretending that he is the same man that he was when he was twenty- one. He should declare to everybody, “Now I am fifty, now I am going to be celibate. Yes, once in a while I will take a holiday from celibacy, but that is going to happen only once in a while.” That’s why they are afraid. Please don’t make them afraid.\nThe woman’s situation is biologically very different. She loses nothing in making love, she is always the gainer. Secondly, as she grows old, she becomes more interested in lovemaking, particularly when she passes the period of menopause and there is no fear of getting pregnant. Now she is dangerous to any man; she wants to make love as many times as possible.\nThis was in the past. Now the situation has changed because of the great revolution: the pill. No woman is afraid of making love. In the past they were afraid before menopause. Menopause comes nearabout forty-eight; for forty-eight years they were continuously afraid of making love, because it meant getting pregnant. It was dangerous – dangerous to carry the child for nine months, dangerous to feed the child from your breast and destroy your beauty.\nA woman who has given birth to one dozen children – do you see what happens to her breasts? They look like Jesus Christ hanging on the cross. Naturally, women were afraid, and they were not chasing men.\nI am against breast-feeding, because the breast is one of the most beautiful things of the woman’s body. The child should be given every chance to play with the mother’s breasts, but as far as feeding is concerned, some other arrangement has to be made. The woman loses her youth, her beauty; she starts using bras, just to deceive people. This is ugly. There is no need for it; man is intelligent enough to give the child food in so many ways. But the child should be allowed to play with the mother’s breasts. If he is not allowed that, then for his whole life he will think only of breasts and breasts and breasts.\nThat is what is happening in the world. Painters go on painting breasts, sculptors go on sculpting breasts. What is this breast mania? They have missed playing with their mothers’ breasts, and now it is too late. And when they come in close contact with a woman of their age, the woman has breasts hanging – yes, just like Jesus Christ on the cross. They are no longer attractive, they have lost the beauty, the roundness, the fullness. They are just a memory, a faded memory.\nBecause of the pill, the woman is completely free of the fear of getting pregnant. And because she is capable of multiple orgasms, one man is not enough to fulfill her desire for love. It is the fault of a blind biology, I am not responsible for it. And I would like to improve on blind biological things, because you are now conscious, alert, intelligent.\nThe woman needs multiple orgasms, but the jealousy of the man prevents her. In my commune, we are going to live with understanding and awareness. If your woman finds that you alone cannot satisfy her, don’t feel offended. She is simply stating a fact – it is not against you. If she keeps clinging to you unsatisfied, she is going to take revenge in every way, because it is you who are preventing her having as much joy as she is capable of.\nIn my commune, nobody should have even the slightest idea that he possesses the woman, or the woman possesses him. Things are possessed, not human beings. And if a woman is free, a man is free – to move with other men, to move with other woman – it is perfectly right, because joy is right, rejoicing is right. Having the freedom to not be a possession is right.\nJust the other night, one beautiful girl was taking my interview for television. And you know I am mad She asked me – now, she was not aware what kind of man I am; she must have taken\nhundreds of interviews of politicians, priests, and all kind of dodos – she asked me, “You have loved\nso many women, but don’t you have a stable relationship with one woman?”\nI said, “That is impossible. I don’t have any relationship – stable or unstable. I live in the moment.” She said, “At this time, who is the woman?”\nI said, “You are the woman! I love you in this moment.” And in the end, when I started singing and dancing with my sannyasins, I called her close to me: “Hold my hand and dance with me.” And it was such a beautiful situation.\nShe told my secretary, “Now my boyfriend is going to freak out!” I have just said, “I love you,” and was just holding her hand and just dancing with my people – why should her boyfriend freak out? And if he’s a freaker, let him freak out. He’s not worthy of being a boyfriend. Drop that worthless creature! Come to my commune where nobody freaks out, everybody freaks in.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nI WAS REALLY TOUCHED WHEN I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR ORDINARINESS. AND IN THE SAME MOMENT I REALIZED THAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ORDINARY. I SEE SUCH A BIG DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU. PLEASE COMMENT.\nI am not! Who told you I am ordinary?\nI don’t take care about yesterdays. I am an extraordinary person! So rejoiceYou are right. I was\nwrong! Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT SEEMS TO ME THAT DEATH ENSLAVES US PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY. IT ALLOWS US THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM FOR SO MANY YEARS AND THEN STEPS IN TO ASSERT ITS CLAIM ON US AND ON THOSE WE CARE FOR. I FEEL AT THE MERCY OF AN IMMENSE AND WHIMSICAL PHENOMENON THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF LIFE, LOVE AND FREEDOM. AND IT FREAKS ME OUT.\nSo we have also one who freaks out? This is not allowed! If you enjoy freaking, why not freak in? Freak as much as you can, but always keep the direction inwards.\nAnd the reason you are freaking out is absolutely stupid. You think death gives you the illusion of life, love, freedom, and then one day suddenly it comes in and everything is destroyed: life, love, freedom. Death is not a reality. It cannot step in or step out.\nDeath never happens.\nThe illusion is not given by death. How can death give the illusion? In fact, it destroys the illusion. If you are aware that death is bound to happen, how can you remain in the illusion that life is going to continue forever? For that you will need really a thick skull. Death is happening every day. All the cemeteries around the world, and the crematoriums – death has left its mark.\nDeath is not creating the illusion. It is your mind that creates the illusion that “It is always somebody else who dies, I never die.” And in a way it looks logical: you always see somebody else dying, you cannot see yourself dying. The man who has died, he was also in the same illusion; he had also seen others dying, and deep down he must have been saying, “It is something that happens to others, it does not happen to me.”\nThis is your mind. Certainly you will never see your death, because dead men don’t see. Mind gives you the feeling that you are going to live forever. Drop that illusion, drop that mind! You cannot be certain even of the next moment.\nAnd it is good that you cannot be certain of the next moment, and the tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow; it is good, tremendously good. Because the next moment is not certain, you are thrown back to the present. This is the only moment you have got of which you can be certain – enjoy it! Enjoy it as totally as possible. Squeeze the whole juice out of it, because who knows? – the next moment may never come.\nDeath is good – it keeps you alert.\nIt never gives you a warning of when it is coming; it comes suddenly out of nowhere. It is a great blessing. Just think: if you were allowed to be immortal in your body, do you think you would enjoy it? Even people who live for eighty years start praying for death. They are bored – the same routine, the same life. What more is there to live for? They are tired, exhausted, weak, old. Now death is their only hope.\nI have heard about Alexander the Great, that when he was reaching India, passing the big desert of Saudi Arabia, he was informed that there is a well in Saudi Arabia – if you drink out of that well you become immortal. Naturally, anybody would have been attracted, and particularly a man like Alexander the Great, who was nothing but a big ego. He wanted to conquer the whole earth, and he was afraid – is there time enough or not? The earth is so big He wanted to become the first man in\nhistory who has conquered the whole earth.\nThis was a good chance; if he is immortal, then there is no problem. And if somebody is immortal, is not going to die, he is not going to be sick either, because sickness, illness, disease – they are just steps towards death. The immortal man will be young, healthy, with no possibility of any sickness or disease.\nAnd Alexander was only thirty-three years old; this was a good time to become immortal. He was healthy, beautiful, strong – this was a good time to become immortal, that meant he would remain thirty-three forever.\nHe stopped his armies and he said, “I am going to the well. Nobody comes with me.” He did not want anybody else to become immortal. If others also become immortal, his immortality would no longer be unique.\nHe went to the well – it is a beautiful story. In the East there are wells made in two ways. One is the ordinary way, a hole in the earth. To reach water level... you have to pull the water up in a bucket. There is also another type of well; only very rich people can afford it. On one side there is an arrangement where you can pull the water up in a bucket. On the side opposite to it there are steps going to the water itself. It is really cool there, silent.\nI have been into many wells. When you sit there for hours, time seems to stop, the whole world seems to be so far away. The noise of the market, the people – nothing reaches there. Sixty feet deep in the earth, it is dark, cool, yet very fresh.\nThe well where Alexander went was this type of well. So he went in, step by step, immensely excited. And just as he was making a cup out of his hands, and filling his hands with the water to drink, a crow who was sitting just nearby on a tree by the side of the well, said, “Wait! Wait a minute!”\nAlexander looked back. He could not believe that a crow – because there was nobody else – could\nspeak, but he was speaking. The crow said, “Wait.”\nAlexander said, “Why did you stop me? Don’t you know I am Alexander the Great? Nobody can stop me! And you are just a crow.”\nThe crow said, “First listen to what I have to say to you, then do whatsoever you want. I have drunk from this well and I have become immortal. Now, for hundreds of years I have been trying to commit suicide – in this way, in that way. Nothing succeeds, and I am tired, utterly tired. And the very idea that I am going to live forever in this despair, in this anguish... even death is not going to relieve me.\n“I have known everything, I have experienced everything. Now there is nothing in the future but a painful, miserable existence. That’s why I said, wait a moment. Now, think it over, and then if you feel like drinking, drink. But I am sitting here only to prevent people, because I am suffering so much.”\nA moment of silence... Alexander’s hands dropped the water back into the well, and he said to the crow, “Thank you, my friend. I am immensely grateful. I had never thought about it, that I would have to live forever and forever. My friends will be dying, my beloved will be dying, my parents will be dying, my teachers will be dying, my contemporaries will be dying – and I will remain stuck forever. No, I cannot drink this water, and I pray to you, please remain sitting here, because there are many fools like me. If they come to know about the well, stop them. It will be one of the greatest acts of compassion.”\nYou say death creates the illusion of life, love? No. It is death that makes you aware that if you want to live, live now, because tomorrow is uncertain. If you want to love, love now, because you may be in the crematorium and sannyasins will be dancing, celebrating.\nDeath is a great reminder. If there were no death in the world, it would have been just hell. Just think: all those people who have died and are sleeping peacefully in the graveyard, all those people who have been burned in crematoriums and have been freed completely, have evaporated into thin air Just think, if all those people – your father, your father’s father, and so on up to Adam and Eve\n– for millions of years, and nobody is dying.… Poison is useless, bullets are meaningless, swords cannot cut heads: what will be the situation? Do you think it will be very pleasant? It will be the worst that can happen.\nDeath makes life beautiful, because it makes you alert: don’t miss the train, don’t miss anything. Enjoy, relish everything possible to you, because tomorrow is death. Death is not your enemy, death is your greatest friend. Without death you will be just dead bodies moving around with no purpose, with no meaning, and no exit.\nIf there can be any hell, its name will be “No exit.”\nJean-Paul Sartre has written a play titled NO EXIT, and it is the description of hell. The only trouble is there is no way out. And according to Christianity, you have to be there forever.\nDeath is your great friend, companion, which makes you love intensely, which makes you not want to miss anything. Religions have not told you the truth. They have been lying to you, telling you that beyond death there is paradise: all beautiful things, joys, blessings, freely available. These people are criminals, because they are destroying your present.\nThey are giving you a hope of a better, far more fulfilling life... after death, so why be bothered about this small time? Why be bothered about living intensely, totally? Just wait for death to come. Meanwhile you go on praying in the church, in the mosque, in the synagogue. You go on listening to all kinds of superstitions and stupidities – they call them sermons – and go on believing whatever the priest says to you. This is all that you have to do in life. And don’t commit a sin; otherwise you may miss paradise.\nAnd if you look deep into the word “sin,” you will be surprised. It means no joy, no laughter, no celebration, no love. Anything that makes you happy is condemned as sin by some religion or other. Remain serious, with long faces, dull, avoid living. Renounce life, love – renounce the world and move into some ugly caves in the mountains, and wait there chanting some mantra– transcendental meditation, or “Ave maria, Ave maria.”\nThese religions have crippled you, destroyed you. They are really messengers of the devil. All the religions of the world are messengers of the devil, not of God. There is no God, but about the devil I am doubtful. Perhaps he exists; otherwise from where do all these theologians, religious preachers, monks, nuns, Mother Teresa, pope the Polack – from where do all these people come? Who sent them? There must be a devil. Or perhaps there is not a devil, but these people are in a conspiracy against human joy, pleasure, comfort, luxury.\nThere is no possibility of a devil. Without God, the devil cannot exist; he is only the shadow of God. The day I said to you, “There is no God,” his shadow also disappeared. So it is a committee, not a devil, a committee of all your prophets, messengers, messiahs – all cheating, deceiving you, destroying your life in every possible way.\nIt is not death that destroys your life and keeps you in illusion. It is your religions that destroy your life and keep you in an illusion which will happen after death.\nI say to you, never forget death. It is always there by your side. Before it grips you, do whatsoever you feel like doing. Dance, have a little champagne. Love, and don’t be bothered about death, because that will be destroying your present. When it comes, if we have lived our life totally and intensely, we will be able to live our death too, with the same intensity, with the same totality.\nYes, in fact death is only a transmigration – changing your house which has become dilapidated, is almost in ruins, and moving into a new house, fresh, just made, made for you. Death is only a change.\nYou have changed many houses, many bodies, and you are still here. Only when you become enlightened, then the work of death is finished, because after enlightenment you will not be changing the house, you will not be entering into another body. After enlightenment you will be entering into absolute freedom, you will be becoming one with the whole existence. You will be in the flowers, in the birds, in the sun, in the moon, in the rain, in the wind. You will be all over the place.\nTo become enlightened means to live this moment without any hesitation, without being half-hearted. Put everything at stake. Be a gambler! Risk everything, because the next moment is not certain. So why bother? Why be concerned?\nLive dangerously! Live joyously!\nLive without fear, live without guilt; live without any fear of hell or any greed for heaven. Just live! Death is not creating any illusion for you, it is your mind. Put this mind aside, so that it cannot disturb your dance, your song, your music.\nCHAPTER 29\nFreedom from blind biology\n2 7 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nYESTERDAY YOU SPOKE OF SCIENCE AND HOW WE COULD PRODUCE A NEW MAN – MORE INTELLIGENT, CREATIVE, HEALTHIER AND FREER. IT SOUNDS FASCINATING AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS SCARY BECAUSE OF THE FEELING OF SOME SORT OF MASS PRODUCT. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FEAR I AM FEELING?\nIt is absolutely fascinating, and there is no need to feel any fear about it. In fact, what we have been doing for millions of years is mass production – accidental mass production.\nDo you know to what kind of a child you are going to give birth to? Do you know if he will be blind, crippled, retarded, sick, weak, vulnerable to all kinds of diseases for his whole life? Does your lover know what he is doing? While you are making love you have no conception, not even a possibility of guessing.\nYou are giving birth to children just like animals, and you don’t fell scared about it, you don’t feel any fear about it. And you see the whole world full of retarded people, crippled, blind, deaf, dumb. All this rubbish! Who is responsible for it? And is it not mass production?\nMy conception of giving scientific birth to a child is that, conscious, alert, knowingly, we are bringing a visitor to the earth. We know who he is, what he is and what he is to become finally; how long he will live, how much intelligence he will have. We are discarding all possibilities of blind children,\ndeaf children, dumb children, retarded in any way – physically, psychologically – and you are feeling fear? Don’t be stupid.\nThe scientific birth of a child is not animalistic. You are transcending the animal by giving birth to a child scientifically. It is fascinating, the greatest, most fascinating thing around. We can manage it, it is already a scientific reality. We can manage healthier people, who will live as long as we want, and we can give them as much intelligence as is needed for their work.\nA couple comes to a scientific lab and tells them that they want a child like Albert Einstein, but better than him, living two hundred years; and he should never suffer any disease, he should be strong. The scientific lab finds the right egg from the bank, the right semen from the bank, and the child is produced in a test-tube with all precautions.\nYou will have to adopt the child, you cannot produce the child. Production of children is animalistic. Adoption of children of your own imagination Everybody wants a Shakespeare to be born, wants\ntheir child to be a great poet, a great musician, a great dancer. Every mother thinks that her child is going to be in some way a superhuman being, and every mother is frustrated – the child turns out to be just rotten. He just gets lost in this whole crowd on an overpopulated planet. This is mass production.\nBut adopting a child, you can contemplate on all the qualities that you need. You can ask the advice of the experts as to what other qualities will be helpful in his life, how much he will be capable of love You want a Romeo? – you can get a Romeo. It is only a question of chemistry. Romeo has\nmore male hormones than anybody else – he is richer; that’s why one woman is not enough for him.\nYou want a poet who will transcend all the poets of the past? A scientist in comparison to whom all the scientists of the past will look like pygmies? A musician who brings the unknown, the invisible, through sounds to you? A poet who sings songs of joy and celebration as nobody else has ever done? You can ask anything, and they have just to work out, calculate which female egg, which male semen will produce such a human being.\nThat semen is not yours, that egg is not your wife’s; you adopt the child. In this way you can get what humanity has always dreamed about: the birth of the superman, a man who is made almost of steel. Your Muhammad Ali the Great will not be able to face him – just one punch on his nose and he will be finished. What makes you afraid? Don’t you want to get above animals? The desire that it will be your semen, that it will be your wife’s egg, is simply ugly.\nChildren belong to the universe.\nWhat speciality has it got that it is your semen? What is the point of creating a crippled person, just because it is your semen? Science can manage to raise you above animality – and it is not mass production, it will be just the opposite. There is not going to be an assembly line the way cars are produced. It is going to be very individual because every couple has the choice and the freedom to decide what kind of child they want.\nHow has the idea of mass production come into your mind? Do you think everybody would like the same kind of child? You are wrong. Do you think science labs will go on producing children\naccording to their own desire, and you have to adopt them? Then it will be mass production. I am not for it. You are absolutely free to choose. Right now you are absolutely blind and doing whatsoever you are doing in utter darkness. You are simply a slave of blind biology.\nDon’t you want freedom from blind biology? Don’t you want to go above this stupid attachment to the idea that the child is born out of your semen and your wife’s egg? Those eggs don’t know to whom they belong. And what is special about your semen? You don’t know anything about it. You are completely unaware of what kind of people are struggling within you to be born. You have no choice, you are simply a slave.\nWhat I am saying about scientific birth makes you go beyond slavery, blindness, darkness. It makes you in a certain way more spiritual, because you are no longer concerned that you semen, your wife’s egg, are absolutely needed for your child. You give your requirements; you adopt the child. And you can ask experts what will be the best for the child. Would you not like your child to be a unique genius?\nFor futile attachments, you are satisfied with a crippled child. And giving birth to a crippled child, a blind child, are you doing any favor to the child? He will never forgive you! You are responsible. And he will have to live a life which is not life a all.\nMy vision gives total freedom to you, and of course, great responsibility. Right now you are producing children without any responsibility.\nYou have means available to determine what color the child should be, what kind of face – Greek, Roman? You can create children who will look like sculptures, utterly beautiful, with genius in some dimension of life, living a life of love, intelligent enough to discard all the priests and all the politicians. They will not become followers of a leader, they will be enough unto themselves.\nRight now, what are you doing? First you create in blindness, darkness a child, not knowing what he is going to turn out like. Then you force him to become a slave by making him a Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, or politically giving him a certain ideology – socialism, fascism, communism. And he is not intelligent enough to rebel against all these slaveries.\nThe child of my vision will be absolute freedom. He will not belong to any political party, he will not belong to any organized religion. He will have his own religion, he will have his own political ideology. What is the need for him to hang around Karl Marx and be a communist? He can think better than Karl Marx – and Karl Marx is not a great thinker. He can live so long that he is not in a hurry about anything; patient, ready to wait – he has time enough.\nJust think of Albert Einstein living three hundred years. He would have given miracles to the world. But because he wa living in an accidental body, he had to die.\nWe can discard disease, old age. We can program life in every way. We can even program the life of the child, so that when he wants to die only then will he die; otherwise he can go on living. If he feels that there are still juices that he has not tasted, if he feels there are still dimensions that he has not explored, if he feels that more time is needed, then he is the master, to decide how long to live.\nUp to now, you have lived seventy years on average – that includes people who live one hundred and fifty years in some places of the world. In Russia there are people who have passed one hundred and fifty years, and they are still young. There are people in a certain part of Kashmir, which Pakistan has invaded, who live very easily to one hundred and fifty, sixty, seventy. And it is a surprising fact – I have been to those people – a one hundred and fifty-year-old person is just working in the field the same way he was working when he was fifty – with the same strength, with the same gusto.\nAll that is needed is better planning, better crossbreeding. It is a known and applied fact about animals. Do you see the many kinds of beautiful dogs around the earth? – small, big, powerful, or just beautiful. Just to see them jump around you is such a joy. Do you think they came out of blind nature? No, for centuries we have been crossbreeding dogs.\nYou know it as a fact – the whole world accepts it – that a man should not get married to his own sister. Why? That should be the most simple thing, to get married to your own sister. You love her already, you have been together since birth, you know each other. But why have all cultures prohibited it? All cultures have said that marriage should be with distant people, people who don’t come from the same family tree, because the bigger the distance, the better the product.\nIf a white American marries a Negro, the child will be far better than a white American marrying another white American, or a Negro marrying another Negro, because the distance between those two is immense – different centuries. They have grown in different atmospheres, their programming is totally different from each other. So when these two totally different cultures, traditions, conventions, lifestyles meet, they give birth to a better man, who has a double heritage: the heritage of the Negroes and the heritage of the white Americans.\nIn a scientific lab it will be possible to find eggs and semen cells as distant as possible. And we can create through that crossbreeding a totally new man. There is nothing scary about it. It is not mass production. The couple has to say what kind of person they would like to have as their child. It avoids all accidents. And we will be creating the universal man – not the Chinese, not the Indian, not the English, but the universal man. So please, just feel fascinated, don’t feel scared and afraid. There is nothing to be afraid of.\nYou have seen the way children have been produced in the past. For millions of years you have been doing the same thing – what is the outcome? The outcome decides the value of what you have been doing. Once in a while there is an Albert Einstein or a Bertrand Russell – once in a while!\nThis is not right. It should be the ordinary phenomenon, usual. Once in a while, perhaps there will be a person who is born out of some unawareness, unalertness on the part of the scientist; otherwise, everybody should be a genius. Just think: the whole world full of people like Rabindranath, Jean- Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger!\nAnd we can prevent people like Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin from being born, because they have been calamities here. We can close the door completely on all Genghis Khans, Tamerlanes, Nadir Shahs – all those ugly monsters whose whole life consisted of killing people, destroying people, burning people.\nThe way we have lived has not proved right. We have only a crowd of pygmies all around – this is what you should be scared of! But having a garden of geniuses, creative people, a garden from\nwhere we have removed all fanatics, idiots, politicians – in short, we have taken out all that was poisonous, all pollution.…\nThere is so much in the idea. Now, how many people are suffering because they have a snubbed nose? Their whole life they feel inferior. How many people are suffering because they have only nose? If you look at them, everything else is so small and the nose is so big.…\nI have heard... one millionaire had a very big nose and very small eyes, but he was the richest man in the community. People used to laugh behind him, but nobody ever dared He was invited by a\nfamily for dinner. The family was concerned about only one thing: their child, who was a born philosopher, asked about everything.\nFrom the morning they were teaching him, “You can ask anything, but when the rich man comes, you are not to ask about his nose.” They told him so many times that he became immensely interested, “What is so great about the nose?” They had never prevented him from asking any question. Why was this nose so important?\nAnd he was really excited, eagerly waiting for the millionaire to come. When he came in, the child laughed. He said to his parents, “He has only nose, nothing else! And why were you preventing me? He is a rare specimen!” He destroyed the whole effort.\nBut people... almost everyone is suffering from something or other. Somebody is suffering from his color, somebody is suffering from his tallness; somebody is too tall, somebody is too small. What have you produced? This is mass production – accidental, produced in darkness. At least human beings – who are the crown in existence – should not suffer anymore from an inferiority complex. The only way is scientific production of children. And there are immense possibilities in it.\nFor example, if the child is produced in a scientific lab, they can produce a similar child simultaneously. The other child will be kept in the lab growing simultaneously; exactly as the one who has gone out to be adopted by a family, the other will be growing in the scientific lab. Just the existence of the other gives great opportunities.\nFor example, you get a fractured leg. Now no need to bother to fix the fracture – the leg from the other fellow can be taken and given to you. Something goes wrong, berserk, in your head – now there is no need for all the psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists. Your head is just removed, you get a fresh head.\nThe other person will remain in anesthesia his whole life, in a deep freeze. He will not know anything of what is happening. He is just there in case something goes wrong with you – and many things go wrong in life, even with every precaution. Something can always go wrong; life is a long affair. You may have a car accident now, that cannot be prevented by scientific reproduction of children.\nIn fact, those children will not believe in the fifty-five miles per hour limit; that will be sheer stupidity. The people who are going to live three hundred years will change everything around. Rather than keeping to fifty-five miles per hour for millions of people, why not create better and straighter roads where you can move at two hundred miles per hour?\nYour roads are just ugly, so many turns – their roads will be totally different. In fact, in Japan one scientist has proved that if a car moves at four hundred miles per hour – and a car can – at four hundred miles per hour the cars, just because of that great speed, rise one foot above the road. No bumps, no troubles from the road. There may be snow, and there may be ice; let it be there – you will be simply going one foot above.\nIn fact, that possibility makes it a great opportunity. If you can move four hundred miles per hour one foot above the road, the road is not really needed! You need only launching roads. The moment you pick up speed, then you can go anywhere; roads or no roads make no difference.\nBut all depends on whether we have courage enough to rise over our fearful selves. We have to rise above the scary feeling. Be fascinated with the New Man!\nThe New Man must have a new kind of birth. The New Man must have a new kind of life, a new kind of love, a new kind of death. He will be new in every possible way. He will replace the old models who are overcrowding the earth – junkyards. They are not needed.\nIt is a simple process of programming the first cell. And only the first cell can be programmed, because then it goes on reproducing itself – that is an autonomous process. You can program it for everything. Right now it is difficult; it is programmed for all kinds of diseases, it is programmed for death, old age. You can’t have any control over it. There is no way to change the program now, because all the cells have the same program.\nIf they are programmed for a particular disease that you get by inheritance, you will suffer from that disease. It could have been changed, but only in the first meeting of the male and the female cells. Everything can be programmed, and an exact copy of you can be kept in the lab. If your heart is not functioning well, the new heart is available – which will fit you exactly, because it comes from your copy, your twin.\nAny new thing scares, but it scares only cowards. Any new thing fascinates, but it fascinates only the brave ones. Be brave, because we nee a new, brave world.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SPOKE OF TRANSPLANTING THE BRAIN OF GENIUSES LIKE EINSTEIN INTO THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN. BUT IF EINSTEIN WANTED TO BE A PLUMBER INSTEAD OF A SCIENTIST, AND WE TRANSPLANTED HIS BRAIN, HAVE WE NOT DONE SOMETHING AGAINST HIS WISHES? HE COULD BE STUCK ON EARTH FOR ANOTHER SEVENTY YEARS, POSSIBLY AGAINST HIS CHOICE. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?\nIt is so simple that I wonder, cannot you figure out small things yourself? The brain is a mechanism, it is not Einstein’s soul. The brain is just a computer. We will transplant Einstein’s brain; that does not make any difference to the journey of his soul. His soul will go on moving, and if he wants to be a plumber and really desires to be a plumber, he may become a plumber.\nBut this brain he has developed, which is unique You may not be aware that he himself donated\nhis brain to Harvard University: “When I die, my brain should be studied as carefully as possible to find what the difference is between my brain and other people’s brain.” And there is a great distance. He himself was curious. He said, “Of course, I will not be able to know, because I will be dead, but it may help you, humanity, to know what the difference is.”\nAfter four years of research the difference has been found. It is very small. That small difference can be introduced into any brain and it will start functioning on a far higher level. But you will be again scared that science introduced something into your brain. It is just a little difference, but it makes a great difference: Einstein had proportionately more of certain cells than any other brain. Now, those cells can be cultivated and introduced into any brain.\nBut nobody is interested. The research is finished, the findings are at hand. Nobody is interested, because the whole world is interested in how to destroy each other. They are so much occupied with war, day in and day out, that many beautiful things that go on happening in scientific research are just lying by the side. Nobody is using them.\nSo don’t be afraid that Einstein will be stuck for seventy years against his will, no. Einstein is a totally different phenomenon than the brain. The brain is just a thing attached to the soul of Einstein. The same brain can be attached to another soul. It will function the same, because it is an attachment; it has nothing to do with the soul. The soul will only supply the energy for the brain to function. If an idiot’s brain is attached to you, your soul will supply energy to the idiot’s brain; you will function like an idiot.\nAnd you know small things change your behavior. You drink alcohol – although it is called spirits, it is not a spirit. Your spirit is absolutely unaffected by the alcohol. Alcohol goes into your brain, into your body, and creates all kinds of disturbances – pleasant, unpleasant. There are other drugs, such as LSD, which can change your whole mind at least for a few hours or a few days.\nWhen Aldous Huxley for the first time – he was a pioneer in that sense – took LSD, he could not believe it: everything looked more beautiful, luminous. Even the chair in front of him was radiant, had an aura of light around it. What had happened?\nThe LSD had tricked his mind, influenced his mind. He saw the beauty of the flowers – those flowers he had seen before, but not the way they were appearing today. The fragrance was overpowering. His soul was the same, but the attached brain now had LSD in it, and was magnifying everything.\nAldous Huxley was a beautiful man of immense intelligence; hence, through LSD he saw only paradise. He started experimenting with other people. Then he became aware that it is not LSD that creates paradise; for some people it creates hell. It depends on the person’s mind – LSD only magnifies, multiplies. If you are a miserable person, LSD will make you a million times more miserable. If you are a man of joy, LSD will magnify your joy a thousand times.\nHe became aware that it is not LSD that creates paradise. LSD does not create anything, it is simply a magnifying glass. So the same flower looks more beautiful, a thousand times more beautiful; the same fragrance is now so dense and overpowering. But a man who is miserable, a man who is continuously down in the dumps, will find himself in the darkest hole ever. That’s why Aldous Huxley wrote a book and named it HEAVEN AND HELL. It is a book about LSD.\nYour soul remains unaffected. When LSD has run out of your physical system, you are back home, the same miserable person you have been before, or the same joyous person you have been before. But the experience of two or three days under LSD changes many of your ideas.\nAldous Huxley himself was so much impressed that he thought all the mystics who have experienced heaven must have been creating something like LSD by their exercises, prayer, meditation and other methods. That’s not true. He was so much impressed that he thought this is the ultimate panacea. But soon he became aware that it not true, because a few people go into hell.\nYour brain is a separate thing from your soul, so don’t be worried about Einstein. His brain is already in the Harvard University, resting in alcohol. Do you think Albert Einstein is caged there in that bottle? Albert Einstein must be a plumber somewhere – perhaps here, because where else can he find a place where plumbers are as much respected as professors? where plumbers are not lower than presidents? This is the only place where nobody is higher or lower. Everybody is doing something essential, something which is needed.\nI am reminded of a phenomenon that has happened in India. Jainism is the oldest religion in India. In one of the conferences of the Jainas, I challenged them. I told them, “If you are really a religion, you should create a commune consisting only of Jainas. And then you will know that you don’t have a complete philosophy.\n“Who is going to make the shoes? Jainas cannot do it. Who is going to be a plumber? Jainas cannot\ndo that. Who is going to clean the toilets? Jainas cannot do it. Then what kind of religion is this?”\nI told them – and made many enemies. That has been my life’s work. I am going to write a book like Dale Carnegie: “How to Influence People and Make Enemies.” I told them, “You are parasites. You are living amongst Hindus, exploiting Hindus; you are parasites. Why should anybody else clean your toilets?”\nThis is the first commune in the whole world which is not in any way parasitical. Here everybody is doing everything. In fact, there is so much movement – professors become plumbers. One day you see the professor teaching in the university and another day you find him plumbing. And you are surprised – what has happened? He says, “I got bored teaching, teaching, teaching. I am on holiday from teaching, and plumbing is beautiful.”\nIn this commune we make holidays by changing your job, we don’t have any other holidays. But changing the job, scientifically, is a holiday, because when you are functioning as a professor, a certain part of your brain functions – only a certain part, not the whole brain. When you are a plumber, another part of your brain functions; the professor is on holiday. This way we don’t lose time, we don’t lose days, and still we enjoy holidays as much as we want!\nDon’t be afraid about Einstein. Just remember, your body is not you.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN YOU TALKABOUT CHRISTIANITY, YOU USUALLYTALKABOUT CATHOLICISM. PLEASE, WILL YOU SPEAK ABOUT PROTESTANT CHURCHES? WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE POPE.\nI certainly have avoided speaking on Protestantism, for the simple reason that the man who created it, Martin Luther, is not worth considering at all. Jesus Christ may be crazy, nuts, but Martin Luther was just a politician.\nThere is no difference between the Catholic’s basic doctrine and the Protestant’s. Why did he create so much fuss and divide Christianity into two parts? – because he himself wanted to become the pope. Finding it difficult... and remember, he was a German, and Germans have something in them that drives them to become Adolf Hitlers; they want to be always on the top.\nJust the other day one Germany journalist was asking me, “Why don’t you use Mercedes-Benz?”\nI asked, “Why should I use Mercedes-Benz? I have tried all the models of Mercedes-Benz, I have the\nlatest Mercedes 500, but they don’t come even close to a Rolls Royce.”\nHe said, “This will make Germans feel very bad. The Mercedes-Benz has to be the topmost car.”\nWhy? It is a good car; my secretary uses it. But the Rolls Royce is simply unique, no other car comes close to it. But to the Germans, it hurts. Strange, what kind of psychology is there?\nIt very much hurt Martin Luther that he was just a bishop. And no German has ever been chosen as a pope. Perhaps they were afraid that once a German becomes the pope, no one knows what he will do He tried hard in the beginning to be chosen a pope.\nIt is a good thing about popes, that by the time a person becomes a pope he is almost on his deathbed. Only this Polack who is now the pope has deceived – Polacks are Polacks. Perhaps he has forgotten to die! Otherwise, popes have been dying after one year, two years, three years at the most. So it gave chances to other people.\nMartin Luther tried many times, but he was never chosen. Then he rebelled. That’s why his religion is called Protestantism. It is a protest – the protest of a politician, the protest of a German, the protest of a man who wanted to be on the top but could not be.\nBut there is no difference of any significance in their theologies. They both believe in Jesus Christ, they both believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, and they both believe in his resurrection after the crucifixion. The only difference is that Catholics also worship Jesus’ mother, Mary.\nFor this much difference, why should I bother about these people? I am hitting at the very roots. These small matters don’t matter. So when I am speaking against Christianity, remember, I am not speaking only against Catholicism. I am speaking against all the sects and cults – and there are many. I am speaking against Christianity as a whole.\nMartin Luther was against the pope because he could not become the pope. You can see he was not really against the pope; he himself wanted to be the pope. It was just the old story of Aesop.…\nA fox was trying to catch hold of beautiful grapes, ripe, inviting. But her jump was not enough to catch hold of the grapes. She tried many times. She was not aware that a small rabbit was watching, hiding in a bush. The moment she saw the rabbit, she walked away with dignity. The rabbit said, “Auntie, what is the matter?” The fox said, “The grapes are not ripe.”\nThat’s what Martin Luther said, “The grapes are sour.” If he was really against the pope, then why did he want to become the pope?\nI will not accept – even if all the Christians of the world ask me to become the pope, I will not accept it. I will not accept even if the whole world asks me to become God, the creator, the father who is... (A noise is heard on the roof of Rajneesh Mandir)... above the roof of Rajneesh Mandir. Those are just two electricians! I will not accept it. Anything that is wrong, howsoever powerful it makes you, I am not going to accept. I am fulfilled, and I am absolutely contented with myself. I have no protest, no complaint, no grudge against anybody.\nIt was for this simple reason that I have not talked about the Protestant section of Christianity separately. There is nothing separate about it. It is just the German mind that makes it separate and I am not in favor of this kind of German mind.\nI have more sannyasins in Germany than anywhere else, for the simple reason that they have seen the ugliness of Adolf Hitler and what he did. The younger generation does not want to carry that German mind any more, and this is the only place where we can deprogram them.\nWe have one dozen communes in Germany. It takes a little hard work to break down the German mind, but it is worth trying, because once it breaks down the breakthrough is not far away. And once a German drops the German mind – it takes longer for him to drop his mind, but once he drops it, he drops it forever.\nThose people have guts. I love them. Sooner or later the whole of Germany is going to be red. We cannot leave Germany, for the simple reason that they are the strongest people in the world. If they can alone fight the whole world, and go on winning for five years under the leadership of a crackpot, these people are of immense value. If we can change Germany, we can change the whole world. That is the criterion: Germany in our hands, the whole world is in our hands, because nobody can have as much resistance as the Germans.\nI have been experimenting, and I have been successful. Once a German has fallen in love with me, it is forever. You ask Haridas. He came to me somewhere around fifteen years ago; since then he has not left for a single moment. His old mother wanted to see him – she had to come, he would not go. He will not leave me for a single moment. And when his mother saw the flowering of her son, the transformation, she did not wait; she immediately became a sannyasin. I have given her the name Haridasi. She is old, but a beautiful woman, very loving.\nMartin Luther was the same type as Adolf Hitler. He created this schism in Christianity, but he has not contributed anything to the world – that’s why I don’t criticize him. I simply ignore the fellow. He is just below me.\nQuestion 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAY THAT WE, YOUR DISCIPLES, ARE NOT FOLLOWERS BUT FELLOW TRAVELERS. IT IS TRUE THAT WE ARE WANDERING AND SEEKING, BUT YOUR TRAVELINGS CAME TO AN END LONG AGO. YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO, NOTHING TO ACHIEVE; YOU ARE UTTERLY FULFILLED. SO WHY DON’T YOU ACCEPT YOUR RIGHT POSITION OF BEING OUR GUIDE? WHY CONFUSE AND CONFOUND YOUR DONKEYS AND CAMELS?\nI am going to confuse and confound all the Yankees, all the monkeys, all the donkeys, all the camels –\nbecause there is no other way to make them lions, and finally to create the child.\nYes, it is true that I have nowhere to go. I have got it, that which you are seeking and searching for. But still I will not accept the idea of being your leader, guide, because those words have very wrong connotations with them. The religious leaders and guides have exploited the whole humanity so much that I don’t want to be associated with them in any way – and those words make me associated with them.\nI am utterly contented, there is nothing more; but I go on walking, moving, just to destroy the idea that I am the leader and you are the follower. You are seeking; I have found it, but can’t I play and seek with you just to help you feel that you are not followers but fellow travelers?\nI do not want to insult you by calling you followers. I respect you. A small device I had to maintain: that is, just to go on seeking and searching with you, knowing perfectly well that there is nothing for me to seek. And there is nothing for you to seek either. It is just that I know it and you don’t know it.\nJust being your fellow traveler, I will infect you. I am contagious! Sooner or later you will realize my play, and you will be grateful, remember. You will be grateful that I never became your leader, never reduced you to be the led, never gave you any guidance – that is humiliating.\nBut just being with you – and I know you have got it, just the way I have got it – in some proper moment I will shake you and wake you up.\nIt is not guidance.\nIt is just shaking and waking.\nGuidance is needed for a goal somewhere far away – what path to follow. I want you to remember that it is not only you who respect me, I also respect you.\nBuddha could not say that, Mohammed could not say that, Jesus could not say that. And I feel there is some weakness in these fellows. Somehow they are feeling a gratification from being the leader, the guide, the prophet, the messiah, the savior. Something of the ego is there – very subtle, sophisticated, refined, slippery, you cannot catch hold of it, but it is there in their declaration of being higher than you, better than you. They have arrived and you are miles away, with miles to travel, arduous miles.\nBuddha and Mahavira say, “Where we are, you will take lives to reach.” They are creating such a big\ndistance between you and themselves. That’s the way of the ego.\nI am trying in every possible way to close any gap between me and you, knowing perfectly well that there is a little difference:\nI am awake, you are asleep.\nPlaying with you, singing and dancing with you, I am certain I will make you awake without being your leader, without being your guide. Don’t be worried, I am not renouncing you. When I say that I am not your leader, don’t think that I am abandoning you. Don’t think that if you are not my followers, then what the hell are you doing here? I take life very nonseriously. It is really a great joke!\nI know more jokes than anybody in the whole world, and I can say with absolute certainty that there is no joke which is bigger than life itself. What a joke – that you are it, and you are seeking it! You are where you are meant to be, and you are running all around, searching for the right place. Not only that, you are suggesting to me that I should take my right position as the guide. I am in my right position – not as the guide, but just as a playmate. Can’t you accept it?\nThat means your ego comes in between. Your ego wants me to be the master of masters, the greatest master in the whole history of the world, because only then can you say, “I am the follower of the greatest master in history; certainly I am one of the greatest followers in the whole history.”\nI am not going to help you in strengthening your ego. I am perfectly aware what hurts you. You would like me to fulfill the image and all kinds of expectations so that you can feel, “This is the right guide, and I am the person who has found the right guide. All other leaders are pygmies, and their followers, of course, are even worse.”\nNo, I am not going to help you in that way. I will play the role of being a very ordinary man. I know, and you know, that I am not an ordinary man, but what to do! I don’t guide you, I help you. You don’t need guidance, you need just a little help, a hit... just a little cold water thrown against your eyes so that you wake up.\nYou will be grateful one day that I never accepted the idea of the leader and the led, because once you accept the idea of the leader you free the led from all responsibility. Once you accept that the savior is here, it means you have nothing to do; you have just to be faithful, believing. And I am destroying all your beliefs and all your faiths – how can I be the leader? The leader needs believers.\nI am something utterly different from the people you have known before: Jesus, Moses, Mahavir, Krishna, Buddha. I am not part of their company.\nWith me begins a new era in enlightenment, where the master will be just playing games with you, where the master will not allow you to be behind him, but drag you by his side. I can put you ahead of me, but I cannot put you behind. It is a subtle device.\nSo don’t feel depressed, I am not abandoning you. I am your master, you are my follower. But don’t tell it to anybody, keep it a secret!\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nDO ONLY COWARDS DROP SANNYAS?\nNobody ever drops sannyas. Yes, once in a while a coward takes sannyas. And I am just incapable of refusing, so even if a coward comes to take sannyas... I know perfectly well he will not be a sannyasin. He will wear the robe, he will make every effort, but sooner or later he will be gone.\nI say nobody drops sannyas except those people who have never been sannyasins; they only looked as if they were sannyasins. I allow them to have the opportunity, because sometimes it happens that a person who takes sannyas without any understanding of what it is – perhaps already thinking, “Let us try it. There is nothing binding; when I go home, I will go home in the same dress as I had come, I will leave all these red clothes behind” – even such a person has the potential. So I don’t refuse anybody.\nIt is unpredictable. The man becomes a sannyasin, already thinking that this is just to take part in the commune – it looks embarrassing not to be a sannyasin here, it is the “in” thing, so just as a fashion he enters. But he does not know that you cannot trick me. I allow him, and start playing the game with him. Ninety percent of these people turn out to be sannyasins. Ten percent, who were only pretending to be sannyasins, drop out.\nThat’s why I say, no sannyasin drops sannyas. Only those who were not really sannyasins drop it. But what have they to drop? They were never sannyasins in the first place.\nTo have a taste of sannyas, to have a taste of me, to drink the wine I am making available to you, to laugh and to sing and to dance – then it is impossible that anybody can drop sannyas.\nYes, a few idiots will be there who will dance only because everybody else is dancing; it looks awkward not to dance. They will be in red clothes because everybody is in red clothes and they don’t want to look like outsiders. Those few idiots will come and go. But my compassion for idiots is as much as for any genius – in fact, a little more. I try my hardest so that the idiot drops his camelhood, becomes a lion. And I have succeeded with many idiots, I have seen them transforming into lions. And a few idiots even have reached to the stage of the child.\nSo my sannyas is available for everybody – with no qualifications, with no conditions. I don’t demand\nthat you have to follow a certain discipline, then only can you become a sannyasin.\nOne day I said this and a few camels went to the office. They said, “Osho says no qualifications, no conditions. We want to become sannyasins, but we will not wear the red clothes and we will not wear the mala.” These camels don’t understand that red clothes and mala are not qualifications, they are not conditions. They are your identification card – spread all over your body, so no need to pull it out of your pocket and show people. You will be seen anywhere from miles away.\nThe red color is really the color of danger. It is your identification card; it is not your quality, it is not your qualification, it has nothing to do with your discipline.\nSo remember, no camel should go to the office and ask for sannyas Then why are you asking for\nsannyas? Just believe you are sannyasins – because you will not be wearing the mala, you will not be wearing the red clothes. So what is the trouble? Why even ask for sannyas? Imagine, believe that you are a sannyasin.\nBut if you ask to become a sannyasin you will have to carry the identification card around the world, because this is how I have approached millions of people. Just think, if I had not given a particular uniform to you, you would have been lost in the world. I would not even be able to recognize you, you would not feel any connection with me. You would not even be able to drop sannyas, and your sannyas would not create any troubles for you in life. And I want those troubles in your life, in your work, in your job.\nI want you to be constantly in a state of challenge, surrounded by hostile forces, because this is the only way a real sannyasin grows – out of fire, burning all around.\nMy sannyasins have been thrown out of their jobs, they have been thrown out of the universities where they were teaching, where they were professors. They are fighting in the courts. When you fight for your sannyas you have some respect for it, some love for it; you have some connection with me. When you are in trouble and you have to suffer many things, and you are ready to suffer but not to drop sannyas, that makes you stronger. It brings your capacities to their peak. You are ready to die, but you are not going to compromise.\nAgainst me and the sannyasins, in Oregon, they have a slogan written on the trucks, buses –\nanywhere they can find a place. The slogan is: It is better to be dead than red.\nI would like you to remember: It is certainly better to be dead than not to be red!\nCHAPTER 30\nEverybody wants freedom, nobody wants responsibility\n28 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEVER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL\n“ISMS.” DOES THIS INCLUDE RAJNEESHISM AS WELL?\nCertainly. But you don’t understand one thing – Rajneeshism is not an “ism.” It is just because of the poverty of language that we had to call it Rajneeshism. It is not an “ism” because it has no theology, no ideology, no philosophy – which are basic needs for an “ism” to exist.\nYou are absolutely free individuals. You don’t belong to a certain concept about existence, about God, heaven and hell. You simply don’t have any conceptualization.\nWe are existential: the “ism” is a mind thing. Our approach to reality is not a mind approach, it is a communion of heart to heart. All “isms” have belief systems: we don’t have any belief system. You are not required to believe in anything unless you know it; and when you know something you don’t believe, there is no need. You believe only things which you don’t know.\nBelief grows only in ignorance.\nKnowing something is enough, there is no need to believe. We are seekers, searchers, not believers.\nWe don’t have any idea beforehand about what we are going to get in the end, when the search\nis over. Hence, I say to you, it is just poverty of language that our approach to reality is called Rajneeshism.\nBut it is not an “ism” at all, because it does not fulfill the requirements to make it an “ism.” Communism is, socialism is, fascism is; all religions are. They are not existential. They are not trying to discover individually, in a very intimate and personal way, what this life is all about. They have taken for granted words of others – and words are just words, containers without any content.\nWords have a strange quality. You can go on and on building big palaces, castles in the air, through words, but there is no base to your castle in the air. The base is provided by your own experiencing. You can become a Christian just by believing in THE BIBLE. You can become a Hindu just by believing in the VEDAS.\nYou cannot become a Rajneeshee by believing in my words. You become a Rajneeshee when you also start feeling the same song I am feeling, you start the dance that is happening within me, you become full of the fragrance It is not wordy, it is existential.\nTo call it Rajneeshism was just a necessity enforced by poor language – it has no word for the existential approach. Even the philosophy of existence is called existentialism – the same stupid idea. Those philosophers are saying that there is no way to find the truth through argument, intellect.\nExistence is available if you are silent, listening to it.… The sound of the running water, the wind blowing through the pine trees, the smell of a rose; the beauty of some face; the ecstasy of dropping all ideas, becoming a child – innocent, enchanted by everything life is made of. He knows nothing about it, but he feels it.\nA just-born baby.… You bring the rose close to him, he will see it, he will certainly find fragrance. But he cannot have in his being, anywhere, words. He cannot say to himself, “What a beautiful red rose.” He does not know that beautifulness has a name, that there are words which call this a flower, a rose.\nHe knows nothing about colors, he cannot say it is red, but he finds it redder than you find it. He finds it livelier than you find it. He discovers immense beauty, fragrance, fragileness – but he has no words. He does not say anything within himself, he is utterly silent, absorbing all that the roseflower can give to him.\nRajneeshism is basically a transformation of you to the child again.\nThe word “ism” is not really applicable, but what to do? Language is a kind of imprisonment. Some word has to be used and all words will be wrong. So I said, “Okay, call it Rajneeshism. But as far as the ‘ism’ idea is concerned, include Rajneeshism completely out of any other ‘ism’ that has existed before.”\nIt would be easier to call it something totally new, but then nobody would understand what it is. So until we have enough people to understand, we will have to carry a wrong label on it. Once they have understood, the label will be removed. Once we have our own world around this earth, “ism” is not going to be part of our way of life. So if you think Rajneeshism is also an “ism,” throw it away. You\nhave not understood anything. Your approach is still intellectual; otherwise, such a question would not have arisen.\nYou can see – no dogma is preached, no belief system is given. You are not required to accept anything. The atheist can become part of my communes, the theist can become part, the communist can become part, the capitalist can become part. We don’t discriminate against anybody. Our basic approach is such, that whosoever becomes part of us, we deprogram. And the process of deprogramming is the same; whether you deprogram a Communist or a Catholic or a Protestant does not matter.\nIt is just like surgery. If a communist has cancer, goes through surgery, do you think the surgery will be different than the surgery when a Catholic has cancer? Will there be a Catholic surgery? Hindu surgery? Mohammedan surgery? You can understand perfectly well that surgery doesn’t take any account of who you are, but it knows how to remove the cancer. And I am continuously hammering on your cancer to destroy it.\nAll “isms” are nothing but spiritual cancer; and if you think of Rajneeshism also in the same intellectual terms, I am going to hammer on it too. But it is not an “ism,” it is not a cancer: it is a surgical method. We just had to give it a wrong name, because no right name exists in any language.\nYes, the day will come when we will start creating new words, new languages. It is certainly foolish that in this world there are thousands of languages – all that it needs is one language. And these languages have grown haphazardly, unscientifically, but we go on carrying them – just junk, thousands of years old.\nJust as I say one world is needed and one world government is needed, so one scientifically created language is needed, so that all men, wherever they are, are capable of understanding each other.\nNo old language should be accepted as the world language, for the simple reason that old languages are not capable of coping with the new reality that goes on changing. And the second reason: if you choose one language out of the old, all other languages which are not chosen will fight against it, naturally. If you just think of numbers, then Chinese will be the world language, because of every four people, one is a Chinese. And Chinese is the most difficult language, the most unscientific, because it is one of the most ancient languages.\nIt has no alphabet, it has only symbols. Just to be able to understand Chinese you have to understand at least ten thousand symbols – just to begin with! If you want to be a real scholar in the language, then one hundred thousand symbols you have to remember. It is an unnecessary burden, absolutely not needed. And even those symbols are not clear.\nIf in Chinese you want to write “war, conflict, struggle, fight,” you have only one symbol – very true. The symbol is one tree and two women under it. That is, one husband and two women under one roof: the tree is the roof. But is is up to you whether to understand it as war, as fight, as struggle, as battle, or just a conflict, a debate, a discussion – because the symbol can represent all these things. You have to learn the context in which the symbol is used.\nTo learn Chinese, if you are not born Chinese, takes at least thirty years. As far as numbers are concerned, Chinese is the first language, and they will not be ready to give chances to any language which is far behind them.\nNo old language will do. But man is capable of creating a language like Esperanto and making it absolutely scientific so that no confusion arises. And because it will be a new language, there is nobody who will be privileged because it is his mother tongue. And nobody else will be disadvantaged because he has to learn a language for thirty years – almost half his life.\nA new language will be equally acceptable to all. It will not be a competitor to any language. And only a new language can manage to be scientific; old languages cannot. Old languages go on adjusting to the new realities, but their adjustments make them silly. For example, horses are no longer important, but horsepower... strange, a car has so much horsepower, an aeroplane has so much horsepower. This is adjustment. Horses are gone, but horsepower will continue.\nIn English you have a word “daughter.” You may not be aware that it is very ancient. It comes from the Sanskrit, duhita. Five or ten thousand years ago, it was the privilege of the daughter to milk the cow. duhita means one who milks the cow. Now from duhita has arisen the word “daughter,” because only daughters were doing that job ten thousand years ago in India. The reason is that the cow is holy to the Hindus, and they would like it to be milked only by a virgin girl, to keep the milk holy. But what has it to do with daughter? There may be millions of daughters who have never touched a single cow, and they are still being called daughter.\nIf you look into the history of any word, you will make amazing discoveries. How has it arisen? Centuries have changed the word’s color, its tone, its pronunciation – everything. New qualities have been given to it which are not applicable. Words are dead things, and it is time that we have one language, scientifically arranged.\nWhen the first American woman met me, it was nearly thirty years ago. She was interested in me – I\nwas traveling, and she asked, “What is your schedule?”\nI said, “Forgive me, I don’t understand this word – skedual? What is a skedual?\nShe was puzzled. She said, “This is a simple word, a common word.”\nI said, “You just explain it to me, perhaps I may be able to figure out what you mean.”\nAnd then I found out – because in India, English is spoken with the British pronunciation, not the American. Certainly the American pronunciation of the word is more accurate because of the spelling of the word. The British pronunciation is “shed-dule,” not “skedual” – they are the same words. I was accustomed to hearing ““shed-dule.”\nI said to her, “Forgive me, but there was no way to figure out that it is ‘shed-dule’ that you are using.”\nThere is so much misunderstanding in the world, and one of the greatest reasons is that we have so many languages. It is a tower of Babel. You cannot understand what the communist is saying, because he has his own connotations of the word, his own meaning. The communist cannot understand what you are saying, he has different connotations of the same word.\nCommunists believe they have the real democracy, because how can a democracy exist where the society is divided into classes? – the poor and the rich and the middlers. If the society is divided and the gap is so big between the rich and the poor, the rich are going to dominate; so don’t call it democracy, it is aristocracy. No communist is ready to believe that in America there is democracy, because the first basic thing is not to write in the constitution that “all men are equal,” but to make them equal; then democracy is possible.\nIf there are so many poor people, their votes can be purchased. They are being purchased, because for the poor man democracy cannot give bread and butter. The word “democracy” is for those who have everything, it is not for him. If he can get something tangible just for giving a vote, he is ready.\nI have seen it in India – India is a democracy, but not a single poor man becomes the prime minister, the governor, the chief minister. It is impossible for the poor man to reach there, because the expenses of election are so big. Yet in the constitution everybody has equal rights, and every vote has equal value. Communists cannot accept the idea.\nAmerica cannot accept Russia as a democracy, because only one party exists. There is no choice – how can you apply freedom? You have to choose the communists, there is nobody else. You have to choose the communists unanimously. What kind of democracy is this? Democracy according to the American mind needs two parties at least.\nRussians go on declaring themselves the most democratic. Americans go on declaring they are the greatest democracy. Now, that word “democracy” is not scientific. It has different meanings to different people.\nYou know the English word “go.” You cannot imagine, howsoever wild a dreamer you are, from where this word “go” comes. It comes again from the cow.\nIn Sanskrit, the cow is called cav. And the Hindus have been interested in the cow so much, they love the cow so much, they have called the cow their mother. And in fact, ten thousand years ago, when the hunting society was changing into an agricultural society, the cow became of immense importance. She was giving food, she was giving bulls to be used for bullock carts, to be used in farming. Everything that the cow gives is usable – even cow dung, because it is a very powerful fertilizer.\nSo they used to worship the cow. And it was a common thing that in the morning the cows would go to the grasslands, and in the evening at the time of sunset they would come back home. And the Hindus started saying, “The cow is going to the forest, the cow is going home.” Going became associated with the cow.\nThe English word “go” or “going” has come from ten thousand-year-old Hindus, and it is associated with the cow, not with you. When you say, “I am going,” you are saying, “I am a cow”! And that’s what Sanskrit-speaking people will understand. And they will be amazed: “What are you saying?”\nAll the languages of the world create walls, very subtle transparent walls, which are far more difficult to remove than the wall that exists in Berlin. The world needs one language, and a new language – simple, accurate. The pronunciation has to be according to the spelling, so that there is now way to mispronounce a word.\nPerhaps it is going to be our work sooner or later to create a new language which gives scope enough for all types of experiences. Right now, there is no way, so just out of compulsion we have called our approach to life, Rajneeshism. But if you think of it as an “ism,” you don’t understand it. If it is an “ism” for you, throw it. If you understand that this is only a label – out of compulsion we had to call it that, to use it – then you will not ask such a question.\nWe are not a religion in the same sense Christianity is, Judaism is, Hinduism is. But what to do with the American bureaucracy? Unless I am a religious leader, they cannot allow me to stay here. I am nobody’s leader, and certainly not a religious leader. I am destroying all the roots of all the religions. But they won’t understand it; I had to accept their stupidity and call myself a religious leader. They don’t have any other category.\nJust the other day my secretary was saying to me, “Somewhere you have said you are an anarchist. If the American government comes to know about it.… They have a basic rule that no anarchist should be allowed to become a resident of America.” They do not understand. I am not an anarchist like Prince Kropotkin. Prince Kropotkin wanted governments to be dissolved immediately; he said there was no need of any government. I think he was a little bit crazy.\nGovernments in existence.… There is so much crime, so many murders, so many rapes, so many drugs, thefts. Just think, if for twenty-four hours the government stops functioning – just a holiday – for twenty-four hours there is no law, no government, what do you think will happen in America? Thousands will be murdered, thousands will commit suicide. Everywhere there will be stealing, everywhere there will be cheating. And it is only for twenty-four hours that the law is no more applicable, so you have to do it fast, whatever you always wanted to do.\nMan has not come to the point where governments can be dissolved. Prince Kropotkin is against the government, the law. He wants to dissolve them. I am also an anarchist, but in a totally opposite way to Prince Kropotkin.\nI want to raise the consciousness of human beings to the point where government becomes futile, courts remain empty, nobody is murdered, nobody is raped, nobody is tortured or harassed. Do you see the difference? His emphasis is: dissolve the governments. My emphasis is: raise the consciousness of human beings to the point where governments become, of their own accord, useless; to the point that courts start closing, that police start disappearing because there is now work, judges are told, “Find some other job.” I am an anarchist from a very different dimension. But my secretary was afraid that they would not understand. To them, anarchism means Prince Kropotkin.\nI am against Prince Kropotkin and his anarchism because he is talking nonsense. First let people be ready – and governments will disappear on their own account. I am not in favor of destroying governments; they are fulfilling a certain need. Man is so barbarous, so ugly, that if he is not prevented by force, the whole society will be in a chaos. Prince Kropotkin is not an anarchist, he is in favor of chaos.\nI am not in favor of chaos. I want human society to become a harmonious whole, a vast commune all around the world: People meditating, people without guilt, people with great serenity, silence; people rejoicing, dancing, singing; people who have no desire to compete with anybody; people who\nhave dropped the very idea that they are special and have to prove it by becoming the president of America; people who are no longer suffering from any inferiority complex, so nobody wants to be superior, nobody brags about his greatness.\nThe governments will evaporate like dewdrops in the early morning sun. But that is a totally different story, a totally different approach. Till that moment comes, governments are needed.\nIt is a simple thing. If you are sick, medicines are needed. Prince Kropotkin wants to destroy the medicines. I want you to be healthy so you don’t need medicines. Automatically you will throw them – what will you do with all those medicines? They are utterly useless, in fact, dangerous; most of the medicines are poisons. For what purpose will you go on accumulating them? See the difference of emphasis.\nI am not against medicines, I am against the sickness of man which makes medicines necessary. I would like a healthier man – which is possible – a man who has no possibility of becoming sick, because we have programmed him from his very birth that he cannot be sick, we have made arrangements in his body to fight against any sickness. Certainly medicines will disappear, medical stores will disappear, doctors will disappear, medical colleges will be closed. But I am not against them! That will be simply a consequence of a healthy humanity.\nYes, I am an anarchist, and if the American government wants to bring in the question of anarchism, I am going to fight, because my anarchism is totally different. Perhaps they have never heard the distinction. They don’t know that these are two totally different things; you cannot put them under one name. But that’s how languages are, because we have not made languages scientifically. They have grown blindly, unconsciously, taken new colors, new meanings. As time changes, languages don’t change. The words remain the same, they just acquire new meanings.\nIn India, there is a word “babu.” It is thought to be very respectful to address somebody as babu. The great leaders of the country, like Subhash Chandra Bhose, are called Babu Subhash Chandra Bhose. Nobody bothers about where the word has come from. And it is not very ancient – only three hundred years old.\nWhen the Britishers invaded India their capital was Calcutta, in Bengal. Only later on when they conquered the whole country and consolidated themselves did they move to the ancient capital of the country, Delhi. Before that Calcutta was their capital.\nBengalis, the people who live in Calcutta and around Calcutta, in the whole big state of Bengal, eat only rice and fish. They love fish so much that anybody who can afford it will have, just beyond the house, a big pond where he grows fish. Just as you see in other countries a beautiful lawn and trees and gardens, in Bengal you will see ponds, according to each one’s capacity.…\nIf you are rich you will have a big pond, surrounded by big trees, lawns. If you are a poor man, you will have just a naked pond, without trees, without lawns, but you will have a pond – dirty – and you will grow fish. And the people smell of fish. The word bu simply means stinking. The word ba simply means with.\nThe British people came in contact first with the Bengalis. Later they came to discover other people –\nIndia is a vast continent: so many cultures, so many different kinds of people – but their first\nacquaintance was with Bengalis. And they were smelling so badly of fish, all the Bengalis, that it was a word of condemnation to call them babu. Britishers started calling Bengalis, babus. It was sheer insult, humiliation. But to be close to the people who have the power... the word “babu” slowly became very respectable. It meant to be close to the throne, to be close to the hierarchy. And everybody forgot its basic meaning.\nNow, the first president of India was called Babu Rajendra Prasad. He had nothing to do with fish, he was not a stinking man, but he never told people, “You should stop calling me babu,” because he himself might not have been aware what the word means. And if the president is called babu, then anybody will feel joyous and grateful if he is called babu.\nOne of my vice-chancellors called me babu. I said, “Shut up! And take your words back immediately;\notherwise I can be dangerous.”\nHe said, “What are you doing? Have you gone suddenly insane? I have not said anything, I simply said, out of respect, babu.”\nI said, “It does not matter that you are ignorant about the meaning of babu. I know the meaning.”\nWhen I explained it to him, he said, “My God! I used to think this was a very respectful word, and I enjoyed being called babu. I used to use the word for people for whom I have a certain respect. But forgive me; I will never use that word again.”\nOld languages have become rotten. A new language is an absolute need – totally new, without any flaws, exact in its meaning. The older the language, the more meanings its words have. In Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, one word has many meanings.\nIn Sanskrit one word can have one dozen meanings. Slowly, slowly a word got settled with one meaning, but those eleven meanings are there. Because of this, Indian philosophers and scholars were very much at ease; disputing, making new commentaries on the old scriptures was an easy job, because each word has ten, twelve meanings, so you can manage to make the scripture mean whatsoever you want it to mean. Another philosopher writes a treatise on the same scripture, and he gives it a totally different meaning.\nThe Hindu scripture, GITA – which is the bible of the Hindus – has one thousand commentaries. That is the number of famous commentaries. There may be many more, but they are not famous; they were written by people who never attained fame, who never attained the attention of the country. But one thousand commentaries on one book!\nIf you read one commentary, you will say, “Perfectly right.” If you read a second commentary, you will be surprised – that too is perfectly right. And when you have read one thousand commentaries, as I have, you will say, “Crazy! Nuts! They are just playing with words.” All the commentaries are contradicting each other. The game is very easy, the language allows it. This is an unscientific language.\nI want one world, one language, one religiousness, one humanity, and when humanity is really grown-up in consciousness, one government.\nGovernment is not something to brag about. It is an insult. Its existence says to you that you are still barbarous, civilization has not happened; otherwise what is the need of a government to rule you?\nIf all the crimes disappear, if all the fears that others can exploit you, murder you, disappear, what will you do with this whole bureaucracy of government? You cannot continue it, because it is a burden on the economy of the nation, a big burden, and it goes on becoming bigger and bigger. The hierarchies have a tendency to become bigger and bigger, for the simple reason that everybody wants not to work, everybody hates work. So everybody needs more assistance; the work is growing.\nYou can see, in any government office, files just piled up on the tables. Unless you are able to bribe someone, your file may remain somewhere in the huge pile, it will never come to the top. And the bureaucrats enjoy many files there; that makes them big, special. They have power over so many people; all these files, to them contain their power over people.\nFiles don’t move unless you are after them. Bribe one table, the file moves to a higher table. Bribe again, it moves to a higher table. The moment you stop bribing, the file stops moving. Strange, it seems bribery is something like petrol: for the car to go on moving, you have to put petrol in. If you are out of gas, finished, the car has stopped.\nI am an anarchist of a totally different category from all the anarchists who have existed on the earth. I am a category in myself, because my approach is totally different. I am not against government, I am against the need for government. I am not against the courts, I am against the need for the courts.\nSomeday, some time, I see the possibility that man will be able to live without any control – religious or political – because he will be a discipline unto himself.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OURSELVES, AND THAT THERE IS NO GOD. WHAT PART DO FATE AND DESTINY HAVE IN OUR LIVES? OR ARE THEY JUST EXCUSES TO AVOID OUR RESPONSIBILITIES BY PINNING HOPE ON SOMETHING OUTSIDE OURSELVES?\nThey are just excuses and nothing more. There is no fate, no destiny. You are just trying to dump your responsibility on something which does not exist. And because it does not exist, it cannot resist you; it cannot say, Please don’t dump your responsibility on me!” God is silent, you can dump anything on him – no resistance, because there is nobody to resist.\nFate is again the same. You fail in love, you fail in other matters. It hurts, that “I have failed.” You need some kind of ointment for your wounded heart. Fate is a beautiful ointment, and freely available, you don’t have to pay for it. You say, “What can I do? – everything is decided by fate.” Success or failure, richness or poverty, sickness or health, life or death – everything is in the hands of an unknown power called fate. “I am doing my best, still I go on failing. I am following all the moral principles preached to me, still I am poor. And I see all kinds of immoral people becoming richer, getting higher, becoming famous. It is all fate.”\nIt gives you solace. It gives you solace that you are not reaching your goals. It also gives you solace that if others have reached, there is nothing much in it; it is just decided by fate. So on the one hand, you are saved from feeling inferior; on the other hand, your jealousy enjoys the idea that the successful is successful only because fate has determined it that way: “It has nothing to do with him, he’s not superior to me.”\nGod, fate, destiny– they all come in the same category: throwing your responsibility onto something which does not exist.\nIf God existed he would not remain silent. I am continually saying he does not exist. If he existed, it is time – he should have appeared in Rajneeshpuram and announced, “I am here! Why do you go on saying that I don’t exist?” But he will never come. There have always been people who have denied the existence of God, but he has never made any effort to prove himself.\nSimple things Edmund Burke, one of the philosophers of the West, stood in the church and said to\nthe priest, “This is my watch. If God exists – I don’t want big proof, just a simple proof – my watch should stop moving. You pray, your congregation can pray, you do anything that you want to do. Persuade your God to stop my watch, and that will be enough to convert me.”\nThey prayed – it was a question of the prestige of the whole of Christianity, a single man challenging God. And he was not asking for a big miracle, just a small miracle: “Stop my watch moving.” And God could not do that. Edmund Burke has proved that there is no God. What an argument! – but simple, clear, relevant.\nYou go on dumping – all over the world – anything that you want to get rid of on God, on fate, on destiny. They are just different names of non-existential things. Certainly you cannot throw your garbage on somebody who is there. There is a limit to patience.\nYou just try throwing your garbage into the compound of your neighbor. Perhaps for one day he may not say anything; perhaps for two days he may wait – but how long? Sooner or later he is going to grab you by the neck and prove that “I exist. You cannot go on throwing your garbage in my compound.” But if there is nobody in the house, you can continue to throw the garbage as long as you want. Nobody will resist, nobody will come out and say, “What is going on? Don’t you have any sense of humanity in you?”\nGod, fate, destiny – these are bogus words, mumbo jumbo, nothing more than that. Drop them completely, because dropping them will make you an individual, fully responsible for your acts. And unless you take the responsibility on yourself, you will never become strong, you will never become independent, you will never have the taste of freedom.\nYou can have freedom. But the cost is to accept responsibility in its totality.\nI have felt such immense freedom that looking at you I feel sad. You have the same opportunity, the same potentiality to blossom into a free individual, but you go on remaining a slave. And the way you manage it is by never being responsible. You think not being responsible makes you free? Not feeling responsible for your actions, for your thoughts, for your being, do you think you are freed from all the consequences? No, absolutely no.\nIt makes you a slave, it makes you something subhuman. It takes all glory away from you. You cannot walk straight, you become a hunchback. Your intelligence cannot grow because you have not accepted the challenge. You are waiting for fate, for destiny, for God. You are thinking, “When the time comes – the right time, God willing – I will be blissful too.” There is no God who can will your blissfulness. You are alone in existence.\nYou come alone, you die alone. Between birth and death, of course you can deceive yourself that someone is with you – your wife, your father, your mother, your husband, your friend – but this is just make-believe. You come alone, you go alone; you are alone between birth and death.\nAnd I am not saying that you cannot love a man or a woman. In fact, when two independent, free people, who take responsibility on their own shoulders, meet, there is immense beauty in it. Nobody is a burden to the other. Nobody is dumping anything onto the other’ you have stopped the very idea of dumping anything. You can be together, but your aloneness remains untouched, pure, crystal- clear, virgin. You never trespass each other’s territories. You can enjoy each other just because you are separate.\nThe more separate you are – the more clearly it is understood that you are alone, she is alone – the more there is a possibility of a great meeting of two alonenesses, two purities, two individuals.\nForget words like destiny, fate, kismet, God. And don’t allow yourself to be cheated by astrologers, mind readers, palmists, predictors of your future. There is no future if you don’t create it! And whatsoever is going to be tomorrow is going to be your creation. And it has to be done today, now – because out of today, today’s womb, tomorrow will be born.\nTake the responsibility totally on yourselves – that’s my message to you. That’s why I am continuously destroying the God in your mind. I have nothing against him. How can I have anything against him? – he does not exist! Do you think I am wasting my time fighting with something which does not exist? No, I am fighting with your conditionings; they exist. God does not exist, but an idea of God exists in you, and I am fighting with that idea, telling you to drop it, be clean, and take the whole responsibility.\nThis is my experience: the day I took my whole responsibility on myself, I found the doors of freedom opening to me. They go together.\nEverybody wants freedom. Nobody wants responsibility.\nYou will never have freedom, you will remain a slave. Remember, remaining a slave is also your responsibility. You have chosen it, it has not been forced upon you.\nI am reminded of Diogenes, a beautiful Greek philosopher, mystic – and a mystic of a rare quality. He was a contemporary of Aristotle, and he was as much against Aristotle as I am, so I have a certain friendship with Diogenes.\nAristotle defined man as an animal who walks on two legs. What did Diogenes do? He caught one animal – and there are many animals who walk on two legs, but they have feathers also, they can\nfly also – a peacock. He took out all the feathers – because men have no feathers. Take out all the feathers of the peacock... the peacock walks on two legs. And he sent the peacock to Aristotle with the message: “Please receive the gift of a human being.”\nThis man Diogenes used to live naked, because he said, “Man is born naked, and he becomes weaker because he is protected by clothes.” All around the world no animal has clothes – except a few dogs in England. England is a mysterious country. Dogs have clothes because a naked dog is un-Christian. You will be surprised to know that in the Middle Ages in England even chair legs were covered with clothes, because they are legs and it is not gentlemanly to see naked legs.\nDiogenes lived naked. He was a strong man. Four people who were doing the business of hijacking people and selling them as slaves in the market thought, “This is a great catch, this man can bring us great money. We have sold many slaves, but not so strong, beautiful, young. We can have as high a price as we demand; and there is going to be a great competition in the marketplace when we put this man on the pedestal for sale. But,” they thought, “four are not enough to catch him. He alone could kill us all.”\nDiogenes was hearing what they were saying about him. He was sitting by the side of the river, just enjoying the cool breeze of the evening, underneath a tree; and behind the tree, those four were planning what to do. He said, “Don’t be worried. Come here! You need not worry that I will kill you, I never kill anything. And you need not worry that I will fight, resist you – no. I don’t fight anybody, I don’t resist anything. You want to sell me as a slave?”\nEmbarrassed, afraid, those four people said, “That’s what we were thinking. We are poor... if you are willing?”\nHe said, “Of course I am. If I can help you in your poverty in some way, it is beautiful.”\nSo they brought out chains. He said, “Throw them in the river; you need not chain me. I will walk ahead of you. I don’t believe in escaping from anything. In fact, I am getting excited about the idea of being sold, standing on a high pedestal, and hundreds of people trying to get me. I am excited about this auction – I am coming!”\nThose four people became a little more afraid: this man is not only strong, beautiful, he seems to be mad also; he is dangerous. But now there was no way for them to escape. He said, “If you try to escape, you will be risking your own life. Just follow me, all four of you. Put me on the pedestal.”\nUnwillingly they followed him. They wanted to take him, but he went! You see the point? Even in such a situation, he was taking the responsibility on himself. He was a free man even in such a situation, where these people are conspiring and trying to sell him in the marketplace, which is the ugliest thing that can happen to a man – to be sold like a commodity, auctioned like a commodity.\nBut he told those people, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t try to escape. You have given me a great idea, I am grateful to you. This is my responsibility, I am going to the marketplace. You put me up for auction.”\nThey could not believe... what type of man was this? But there was no way to escape, so they followed him. And when he was put on a high pedestal so that everybody could see, there was\nalmost silence, pindrop silence. People had never seen such a proportionate body, so beautiful – as if made of steel, so strong.\nBefore the auctioneer said anything, Diogenes declared, “Listen, people! Here is a master to be sold to any slave, because these four poor people need money. So start the auction; but remember, you are purchasing a master.”\nA king purchased him. Of course, he could do it – more and more money he offered at the auction. Many people were interested, but finally a sum, larger than any which had ever been heard of, was given to those four people. Diogenes said to them, “Are you happy now? You can go, and I will go with this slave.”\nOn the way, when they were moving to the palace in the chariot, the king said to Diogenes, “Are you crazy or something? You think yourself a master? I am a king, and you think me a slave?”\nDiogenes said, “Yes, and I am not crazy, you are crazy. I can prove it right now.” At the back of the chariot was the queen. Diogenes said, “Your queen is already interested in me, she is finished with you. It is dangerous to purchase a master.”\nThe king was shocked. Of course, he was nothing in comparison to Diogenes. He took out his sword and asked his queen, “What he is saying, is it true? If you say the truth, your life will be saved – that is my promise. But if you say an untruth, and I find it out later on, I will behead you.”\nFearful, afraid, still the queen said, “It is true. Before him, you are nothing. I am enchanted, allured; the man has some magic. You are just a poor guy compared to him. This is the truth.”\nOf course, the king stopped the chariot and told Diogenes, “Get out of the chariot. I make you free; I\ndon’t want to take such risks in my palace.”\nDiogenes said, “Thank you. I am a man who cannot be made a slave, for the simple reason that every responsibility I take on myself. I have not left those four people feeling guilty – they had not brought me there, I had come of my own accord. They must be feeling obliged. And it is your chariot, if you want me to get out, that is perfectly good. I am not accustomed to chariots at all, my legs are strong enough. And I am a naked man, a golden chariot does not fit with me.”\nTake responsibility! And then even in utter poverty, suffering, imprisoned in a jail, you will remain completely a master of yourself. You will have a freedom which comes with responsibility.\nAll these religions have been making you dependent on God, on fate, on destiny. Those are just different names of something non-existential. What is true is your slavery or your freedom. Choose. If you choose freedom, then you have to destroy all the strategies of religions which make you a slave. That’s what I am doing here: cutting all your chains, making you free from everything, so that you can be yourself.\nAnd the moment you are yourself, you start growing, you become greener. Flowers start opening up, and there is great fragrance around you.\nCHAPTER 31\nNo religions, no nations, no governments\n2 9 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOUR WAY IS THE WAY OF THE HEART, AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS THE WAY OF THE HEAD. WILL IT EVER BE POSSIBLE THAT MAN CAN FUNCTION FROM A BLEND OF BOTH HEAD AND HEART, OR MUST THE TWO ALWAYS REMAIN TOTALLY DIVORCED? WILL IT ALWAYS BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?\nThe first thing to be understood is that there is no way, either of head or of heart. Every way leads you away, away from the truth that you are.\nIt would have been so easy if there were a truth somewhere. Howsoever difficult the way, people would have reached. The more difficult, the more far away the truth was, the more challenging to the ego. If man’s ego challenges him to reach the highest peak in the Himalayas, Everest, where nothing is to be found; if man’s ego gives him incentive to waste billions of dollars to reach the moon, risking lives.… But man has reached the moon. And the first man who walked on the moon must have looked silly to himself – there was nothing for which so much endeavor, technology, preparation was needed.\nRemember, the ego wants challenges. It lives through challenge.\nWhy have so few people been able to have a glimpse of the truth? – because it is not a challenge; it is not there, it is here within you. It does not need any way, you are already it.\nBut the question has one other implication too: Will it ever be possible for the head and heart to be married, or are they going to remain forever divorced? It all depends on you, because both are mechanisms. You are neither the head nor the heart. You can move through the head, you can move through the heart. Of course you will reach different places because the directions of the head and the heart are diametrically opposite.\nThe head will go round and round thinking, brooding, philosophizing; it knows only words, logic, argument. But it is very infertile; you cannot get anything out of the head as far as truth is concerned, because truth needs no logic, no argument, no philosophical research. Truth is so simple; the head makes it so complex. Down the centuries philosophers have been seeking and searching for the truth through the head. None of them has found anything, but they have created great systems of thought. I have looked into all those systems: there is no conclusion.\nThe heart is also a mechanism – different from the head. You can call the head the logical instrument; you can call the heart the emotional instrument. Out of the head all the philosophies, all the theologies are created; out of the heart, come all kinds of devotion, prayer, sentimentality. But the heart also goes round and round in emotions.\nThe word “emotion” is good. Watch... it consists of motion, movement. So the heart moves, but the heart is blind. It moves fast, quick, because there is no reason to wait. It does not have to think, so it jumps into anything. But truth is not to be found by any emotionality. Emotion is as much a barrier as logic.\nThe logic is the male in you, and the heart is the female in you. But truth has nothing to do with male and female. Truth is your consciousness. You can watch the head thinking, you can watch the heart throbbing with emotion. They can be in a certain relationship.…\nOrdinarily, the society has arranged that the head should be the master and the heart should be the servant, because society is the creation of man’s mind, psychology, and the heart is feminine. Just as man has kept the woman a slave, the head has kept the heart a slave.\nWe can reverse the situation: the heart can become the master, the head can become the servant. If we have to choose between the two, if we are forced to choose between the two, then it is better that the heart becomes the master and the head becomes the servant.\nThere are things which the heart is incapable of. Exactly the same is true about the head. The head cannot love, it cannot feel, it is insensitive. The heart cannot be rational, reasonable. For the whole past they have been in conflict. That conflict only represents the conflict and struggle between men and women.\nIf you are talking to your wife, you must know it is impossible to talk, it is impossible to argue, it is impossible to come to a fair decision, because the woman functions through the heart. She jumps from one thing to another without bothering whether there is any relationship between the two. She cannot argue, but she can cry. She cannot be rational, but she can scream. She cannot be cooperative in coming to a conclusion. The heart cannot understand the language of the head.\nThe difference is not much as far as physiology is concerned, the heart and the head are just a few inches apart from each other. But as far as their existential qualities are concerned, they are poles apart.\nMy way has been described as that of the heart, but it is not true. The heart will give you all kinds of imaginings, hallucinations, illusions, sweet dreams – but it cannot give you the truth. The truth is behind both; it is in your consciousness, which is neither head nor heart. Just because the consciousness is separate from both, it can use both in harmony. The head is dangerous in certain fields, because it has eyes but it has no legs – it is crippled.\nThe heart can function in certain dimensions. It has no eyes but it has legs; it is blind but it can move tremendously, with great speed – of course, not knowing where it is going. It is not just a coincidence that in all the languages of the world love is called blind. It is not love that is blind, it is the heart that has no eyes.\nAs your meditation becomes deeper, as your identification with the head and the heart starts falling, you find yourself becoming a triangle. And your reality is in the third force in you: the consciousness. Consciousness can manage very easily, because the heart and the head both belong to it.\nYou know the story of a blind beggar and a crippled beggar They both lived outside the village in\nthe forest. Of course, they were competitors to each other, enemies – begging is a business. But one day the forest was on fire. The cripple had no way to escape, because he could not move on his own. He had eyes to see which way they could get out of the fire, but what use is that if you don’t have legs? The blind man had legs, could move fast and get out of the fire, but how was he going to find the place where the fire had not reached yet?\nBoth were going to die in the forest, burned alive. It was such an emergency that they forgot their competition. In such emergencies only a Jew can remain a businessman, and certainly those two beggars were not Jews. In fact, to be a beggar and a Jew is a contradiction in terms.\nThey immediately dropped their antagonism – that was the only way to survive. The blind man took the cripple on his shoulders, they found the way out of the fire. One was seeing, and the other was moving accordingly.\nSomething like this has to happen within you – of course, in reverse order. The head has the eyes, the heart has the guts to move into anything. You have to make a synthesis between the two. And the synthesis, I have to emphasize, should be that the heart remains the master, and the head becomes the servant.\nYou have as a servant a great asset – your reasoning. You cannot be befooled, you cannot be cheated and exploited. The heart has all feminine qualities: love, beauty, grace. The head is barbarous. The heart is far more civilized, far more innocent.\nA conscious man uses his head as a servant, and his heart as the master – just the opposite of the story I told you.\nAnd this is so simple for the man of consciousness to do. Once you are unidentified with head or heart, and you are simply a witness of both, you can see which qualities should be higher, which\nqualities should be the goal. And the head as a servant can bring those qualities, but it needs to be commanded and ordered. Right now, and for centuries, just the opposite has been happening: the servant has become the master. And the master is so polite, such a gentleman, that he has not fought back, he has accepted the slavery voluntarily. The madness on the earth is the result.\nWe have to change the very alchemy of man. We have to rearrange the whole inside of man.\nAnd the most basic revolution in man will come when the heart decides the values. It cannot decide for war, it cannot go for nuclear weapons; it cannot be death-oriented. The heart is life’s juice. Once the head is in the service of the heart, it has to do what the heart decides. And the head is immensely capable of doing anything, just right guidance is needed; otherwise, it is going to go berserk, it is going to be mad. For the head there are no values. For the head there is no meaning in anything. For the head there is no love, no beauty, no grace – only reasoning.\nBut this miracle is possible only by disidentifying yourself from both. Watch the thoughts, because in your watching them, they disappear. Then watch your emotions, sentimentalities; by your watching, they also disappear. Then your heart is as innocent as that of a child, and your head is as great a genius as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Aristotle.\nBut the trouble is far bigger than you can conceive. It is a male-dominated society; man has been creating all the rules of the game, the woman has just been following. And the conditioning has gone so deep, because it has been going on for millions of years.\nIf in the individual the revolution happens and the heart is re-enthroned, given its right place as the master, and the head given the right place as a great servant, this will affect your whole social structure. You can see it happening in my commune.\nThe woman is the master; she is not longer mistress, and the man is no longer master. People go on asking me why, for all significant posts, I have chosen women? For the simple reason that the woman will not create the third world war.\nIt has been a historical fact that each war is created by the man, but the woman suffers most. Strange – the man is the criminal and the consequence happens to the woman! The woman loses her husband, the woman loses her children. The woman loses her dignity, because whenever a country is invaded, the soldiers are so much repressed – just like the monks Sexually they had\nno opportunity while the war was going on. When the opportunity arises – they invade a city and conquer it – their first attack is on the woman.\nAnd the war has nothing to do with the woman, she is simply outside of the game – it is a male game, just like boxing – but she has to be raped. Those soldiers are hankering not to be victorious for their nation’s glory – that is a faraway thing – they are hankering to get the women of the enemies as quickly as possible.\nI am putting women in all significant, powerful positions. It is symbolic. Man has a tremendous capacity to do things, but he should not be the guide anymore. He is hung up in his head. He\ncan also become the master if he puts his heart above his head. That’s why I said that all of my sannyasins are women – even those who biologically, physiologically, are men. The moment they become sannyasins they have accepted a new structure, they have put something above their head – their heart.\nThis is what I mean: that even men around me start learning feminine qualities. And feminine qualities are the only qualities worth having.\nSo there is a possibility, but the possibility has a basic condition to be fulfilled: you become more conscious, a witness, a watcher of all that goes on inside you. The watcher becomes immediately free from identification. Because he can see the emotions, it is an absolute certainty that “I am not the emotions.” He can see the thoughts; the simple conclusion is, “I am not my thought process.”\n“Then who am I?” – a pure watcher, a witness. And you reach to the ultimate possibility of intelligence in you: You become a conscious man.\nAmongst the whole world sleeping, you become awake, and once you are awake there is no problem. Your very awakening will start shifting things to their right places. The head has to be dethroned, and the heart has to be crowned again. This change amongst many people will bring a new society, a New Man in the world. It will change so many things, you cannot conceive.\nScience will have a totally different flavor. It will not serve death anymore, it will not make weapons that are going to kill the whole of life on the earth. It will make life richer, discover energies which can make man more fulfilled, which can make man live in comfort, in luxury, because the values will have completely changed. It will still be mind functioning, but under the direction of the heart.\nMy way is the way of meditation.\nI have to use language, unfortunately, that’s why I say may way is the way of meditation: Neither of\nhead nor of heart, but of a growing consciousness which is above both mind and heart. This is the key to open the doors for a New Man to arrive on the earth.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI WAS BROUGHT UP AS A QUAKER, AND WE WERE TOLD NEVER TO SWEAR ON A BIBLE IN COURT, BECAUSE AS QUAKERS WE COULD ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND THAT THE SOURCE OF OUR TRUTH WAS SILENCE. THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAY, I AM SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE THEOLOGY OF QUAKERISM.\nI am also surprised.\nThe first thing: Quakerism is part of Christian theology. I have never said anything against Quakerism, but you are forcing me to now.\nIt is a by-product of Christian theology, and I am against all theologies. Quakerism is not an independent religion, but just a sect of Christianity. It accepts all kinds of stupidities that are propounded by Jesus and his theologians. It is not against THE BIBLE – and THE BIBLE is so full of rubbish, lies.\nThe basic lie is God, the holy ghost, Jesus the only begotten son of God. Lies upon lies – a virgin birth, resurrection after being crucified. Quakerism does not deny all these things, it accepts them.\nSecondly, you are saying you have been told not to take oath upon the BIBLE in the court. I have also said that the oath is absolutely unnecessary. A man who is capable of lying – no oath can prevent him. And to take an oath placing your hand on THE BIBLE is hilarious. THE BIBLE is so full of lies, and you are taking an oath for truth – that you will not speak anything but truth!\nMy reason not to take an oath on any religious scripture is totally different from that of the Quakers. The Quakers believe – remember, they believe: I know. You have been told: I have seen.\nAnd the difference is infinite between being told and experiencing it on your own.\nJust by being told that because you are a Quaker whatsoever you speak will be truth.… This is strange. It is a belief, borrowed knowledge, conditioning. Just by your being a Quaker, it is not a certainty that whatsoever you speak will be the truth.\nYes, if you have experienced total silence, then nothing can come out of you which is not true.\nBut I know many Quakers. They sit in silence also in their congregations. I have been to their congregations, and I have asked them, “If you are really truthful, tell me: What were you doing in your silence?” And they have always said, “We were thinking – thinking of silence, trying to be silent, making efforts to be silent.” Yes, it is true they are not speaking. If you mean just by not speaking you are silent, then you are just a fool.\nSilence is such a deep experience, where thoughts, emotions, everything disappears. If you have attained to that silence you will not even call yourself a Quaker. You will not subscribe to any theology. You don’t need one; you have found the very source of truth within yourself.\nThe Quakers have been defying the court; they will not take the oath. They have been punished for it, because it is an insult to the court, it is contempt of the court: they have been imprisoned, tortured. But the Quaker and my sannyasin are totally different.\nI say the oath is useless. But I teach my sannyasins to be nonserious. To the Quakers it has become something of a dogmatic idea, a fanatic standpoint: they will not take the oath. I tell my sannyasins, “You live in a society, you have to follow their rules – remembering that they are all man-made.”\nFor example, in some countries you have to drive on the right side of the road, in some countries on the left side of the road. What is wrong with the right side? You can say that it makes no difference whether you drive on the right side or left side, it is simply a rule. Don’t Quakers follow this simple rule? You don’t take it seriously, there is no problem in it; it is simply a question of managing the traffic. It can be done in both ways, so there is nothing serious about it. It is not something like an ultimate law of existence, that if you drive on the right side you will go to hell.\nQuakers have been going to jail. I will not tell my sannyasins to do that. It is not worth it. Take the oath, and say whatsoever you want to say. Oath or no oath, it makes no difference to your statements. Why unnecessarily enrage those poor judges and juries? Let them be satisfied. If they are feeling happy just by your taking an oath, and feeling that now whatever you say will be the truth, let them befool themselves. You have to say what you want to say. The oath is irrelevant to you, but why make so much fuss about it that you have to go for two years behind bars?\nI am a nonserious man. Quakers are very serious about it. They will risk their life, but they will not take the oath. The oath has become more important than life itself.\nIt is just a game. You play cards: there is a king and there is a queen and there is a joker, and all sorts of people are there. You know that this is just a playing card, and this queen is just like the queen of England – absolutely meaningless, powerless. But while playing the game you have to accept that this is the queen, this is the king, this is the joker, and so on, so forth. You don’t start going to jail because “I will not accept this card as the king!” It is up to you – don’t play the game.\nThese are all games. That is the difference. You are asking me what the difference is, why I criticize Quaker theology. In fact, I have never done it before, but from now onwards I am going to do it unless you start quaking! To take games of life seriously shows only your stupidity, not your silence.\nI have been in the courts. I have taken an oath, but before I take the oath I certainly make a statement telling the judge, “I will follow the rule, I will take the oath, but the oath cannot make any difference to me. I will speak only that which I want to speak.\n“And your oath, in fact, frees me from telling the truth and only the truth, because the oath I am taking on THE BIBLE, on the GITA, on the KORAN – which are full of lies... naturally by taking the oath on THE BIBLE I am completely freed. Now I can lie without any trouble. Without an oath I will only speak the truth; with an oath, there is no need because I have already lied by putting my hand on THE BIBLE.”\nQuakers are not against THE BIBLE – I am. In one court I refused to put my hand on THE BIBLE. I\nsaid, “I will keep a little distance.”\nThe judge asked, “Why?”\nI said, “Because it is such garbage I don’t want to touch it. It is your rule, so I will put my hand on top of it, but I will keep a little distance. I am very allergic.” There is an immense difference between my criticism of this system of oath taking and the Quakers’ criticism.\nI am not saying that just because you are a sannyasin that’s enough to guarantee that you will speak only the truth, no. Just being sannyasins does not mean that you will only speak the truth. And it is not so easy to decide what the truth is.\nIt happened that one of the great historians was writing the history of the whole world. It was an immense job to write the whole history of the whole world, of all the nations. He devoted almost fifty years, working almost twelve, fourteen hours a day. And the day he was coming to his last page, something happened and he burned his whole life’s effort.\nSomebody was murdered just in the neighborhood. Of course, so many people gathered there: the police were there, the journalists were there. The historian also went there. He asked one person who was an eyewitness, he asked another person who was an eyewitness – and he was amazed. The stories of all the eyewitnesses were different. And there was no reason for them to lie, they were not involved in it.\nOne eyewitness said he was killed inside the house. Another eyewitness said he was killed under the sky, the open sky. The truth was that he was killed in a house which was just being built, and the roof was not yet there. He was killed under the open sky – without the roof you can’t call it a house. But it was a house in the process of being built. The roof is only a part of the house, so the other was not lying either, saying that he was killed inside the house.\nListening to other eyewitnesses, he became suddenly aware of one thing: “A murder happens in my neighborhood; within two minutes’ time I am there, eyewitnesses are available – and it cannot be decided what actually happened. I have been wasting my whole life writing about Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah – so much time has passed. Can I say truthfully that what I have written is factual? Perhaps many of these people never existed!”\nGeorge Gurdjieff had a theory about Jesus Christ: that he never existed, that it is only an ancient drama which was played amongst the Jews, there has never been a historical man Jesus. And he supported his idea that it is only a drama, just like the dramas of Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw. His first piece of evidence was that Jesus is not mentioned in any Jewish book.\nSuch a man, who could walk on water, do you think he would not create news? Would he not be mentioned somewhere in the contemporary literature? A man who can raise the dead back to life – if he is not mentioned, then who else will be mentioned? This man was doing all kinds of miracles: turning stones into bread, turning water into wine.… And the resurrection – he was crucified but God would not allow his only begotten Son to be dead, so he came back again.\nThese things make a man so significant that you cannot ignore him, yet in no Jewish history he is even mentioned, not even in the footnotes! George Gurdjieff has an argument there; he says it is simply a drama. Nobody has been able to criticize George Gurdjieff; you cannot find anything that can contradict what he is saying. So what is the truth?\nTake the oath; if that is the rule of the game, play it accordingly. But make it clear that it makes no difference to you.\nPerhaps it was making a difference to people in the past. And I say to you, it will make a difference to the Quakers too, because they believe in THE BIBLE, they believe in the biblical God, they believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The whole Christian theology is theirs.\nIf you believe in God, you feel afraid taking the oath in the name of God – the superstitious man will feel afraid: now it is not a question of the court, it is now a question of God and the holy book. To lie now will not only be a crime, it will be a sin also. Afraid of this, there is a possibility he will say the truth.\nFor my sannyasins there is no problem. There is no God, there is no holy book. My sannyasins can take an oath on any novel and it will be the same. They can take an oath on anything, it makes\nno difference at all; they will say what they want to say. The court cannot exploit their superstitions, because they have none.\nThe oath was significant, is significant, for the so-called religious people of the world. And that’s why a Hindu is not given THE BIBLE to take an oath on. He is given the GITA, because THE BIBLE he can spit on without any trouble. But the GITA? If by accident the GITA falls from his hands, or his feet by accident touch the GITA, he is in tremendous anguish. He has to fast, and go to the holy Ganges river to take a bath: he has committed a great sin.\nNow, this man can be exploited. The court can manipulate this man to tell the truth. But no court in the whole world can manipulate my people. We don’t have any holy book, we don’t have any God to be afraid of. Once you are free of superstitions, laughingly you can take the oath and say whatsoever you always wanted to say – oath or no oath. So remember, there is a difference.\nAnd if the court is stubborn, don’t take it seriously. It is stupid to suffer two years in jail just for not taking the oath. And why are you so afraid? Are you afraid because you were going to lie, and now after the oath you cannot lie? What is the fear?\nYou say, “I have been told that the Quaker only speaks the truth.” You have been told – and the man who has told you was lying! Just being a Quaker makes no difference. How can it make any difference? Yes, Quakers sit in silence, but I know their silence is bogus, because they don’t have the method to enter into silence. They just say, “We sit in silence.” Yes, they are not talking, but they are thinking, they are feeling – emotions are there.\nSilence means you are a witness, and that word “witness” has no place in the Quaker theology. And without being a witness you cannot be silent; there is no other way. You will have to go through the whole process of witnessing; only then, slowly, slowly, things will start dropping away.\nMy people know that unless they succeed in meditation – which is another name of witnessing – they will remain unconscious, and an unconscious man is asleep. Can you say to a man who is just getting ready to fall into bed and go to sleep, can you tell the man, “Please take an oath that you will not dream about wrong things”? He may take the oath, but he will be dreaming in the same way as he was dreaming before.\nThe oath will not make any difference, because the oath is taken by the conscious mind, and there are deeper layers which know nothing about it. The unconscious mind has no idea about the oath, and the collective unconscious mind is far deeper, and the cosmic unconscious mind is deeper than the Pacific. They know nothing about your oath, and in sleep they will be functioning, not your conscious mind. Your conscious mind, which has taken the oath, will be asleep.\nSleepy people, unconscious people, can believe in anything, but their belief makes no difference to their inner reality.\nSo please, forget the idea that my opposition to the oath is the same as the Quakers’ opposition to the oath. Their opposition has different arguments for it. They say, “Because a Quaker always speaks the truth, that’s why we will not take the oath.”\nI say to my sannyasins, “Make the statement in the court: ’The oath is a very ancient superstition. I will take it, if this is the game that I have to play, but I cannot be serious about it. It does not matter – you can give me THE BIBLE or you can give me PLAYBOY magazine, it won’t make any difference; I will simply say what I have to say. Your oath cannot make any difference to my statements.”\nAnd we are not ready to go for two years to jail for such a stupid thing. If those judges and juries and the courts are behaving stupidly, have you also to behave the same? Make them a laughingstock, make their idea of oath taking foolish.\nMy reasoning against the oath is totally different. It has nothing to do with your Quakerism. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nMY FEAR AROUND YOUR VISION OF THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN THROUGH TEST-TUBES AND GENETIC ENGINEERING COMES NOT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF, BUT FROM FEAR OF WHO MIGHT CONTROL THE TECHNOLOGY. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USED BY CONSCIOUS HUMAN BEINGS, RATHER THAN THE IDIOT POLITICIANS WHO WOULD TURN OUR BRAVE NEW WORLD INTO ORWELL’S 1984?\nWho controls the technology today?\nWho controls all your nuclear weapons? Who controls all your scientific discoveries?\nHave you raised your voice against it? Have you even thought that the whole life on the earth is now in the hands of idiotic politicians?\nAnd it has been always so. Anything discovered is immediately captured by the governments, so why is the question only about genetic engineering? Are you not afraid that the politicians have nuclear weapons which can destroy you seven hundred times? Although destroyed once, you will not need to be destroyed again – because you are not the only begotten son of God, you will not resurrect; and messiahs are not around who will bring you back to life.\nBut you are afraid – I can understand – that if this genetic engineering is in the hands of politicians, certainly they are not going to produce the man of beauty, love, silence, intelligence, grace. They are going to create steel robots, to make all of them soldiers to fight, to kill. I know it. That’s why I have proposed there should not be nations, the world should have only one functional government. All boundaries have to be removed, all passports and green cards have to be burned. That you are a human being is enough to enter any country.\nIt is a very strange thing. You don’t ask the birds, “Where is your passport? How did you dare to enter America? – you need a visa. And if you want to remain permanently here you will need a green card.” Animals seem to be more free than you, because animals don’t know anything about the boundaries that you have drawn on your map. They go on moving from one place to another place. Sometimes they travel thousands of miles.\nThere are a few birds who live at the North Pole, but when it becomes absolutely impossible to live there because of the cold, they start moving towards warmer places. Three thousand miles they will travel – and they don’t care about your nations. In a new place... for example, they will travel and come to a warmer place, and when it it the time, there is the season of mating. So they give birth to eggs, but they don’t have enough time to take care of the eggs; three thousand miles have taken so much time.\nThey have to go back, because now the climate at the North Pole is again ready to welcome them. So they leave their eggs and fly three thousand miles again. The eggs grow on their own, the children are born. And it is something mysterious – science has not been able to figure it out: there is no guide, there is no school to teach them, there is nobody even to tell them where their parents have gone, but these newly-born birds start moving towards the North Pole three thousand miles away. Existence is really mysterious.\nNobody asks about them, when they cross the borders. Even if you ask, they will not understand your language. And even if you try to keep them out, it will be almost impossible. Man is not as free as birds, animals, fish. What a degradation!\nHence, whenever I say anything, remember the whole context of it; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I want one world, so that there is no war and no need of soldiers. I want one world government. I want the president of the world government only to be president for six months, so that he cannot do any harm. And I want one person to be chosen only once. These are all precautions.\nGenetic engineering, to give birth to children in scientific labs, will be in the hands of the scientists.\nWe have tried religion and it failed. We have tried politics and it has failed. Now we have to try science. Give it a chance, because in three hundred years it has made more progress than man has made in his whole history of millions of years.\nAnd I have proposed to you that the world should have one academy of sciences, so there is no Russian scientist, no American scientist, no Hindu scientist, no Christian scientist – all that is past. That academy will have all the geniuses of the world. And all other efforts have failed; science should be given a chance. There is no harm. At the most it can fail – the worst possibility is that science also will fail – but I don’t think it can fail.\nWe have to prepare a new kind of man. Out of that new kind of man – meditative, silent, loving – will be coming scientists.\nAnd I am not a pessimist; nor am I an optimist. I am very much a realist. As I conceive it, all these things are possible. In fact, without them life will become impossible. The choice is yours. Give science a chance, and prepare the ground so that there are no governments – only one government, which has no desire to fight because there is nobody to fight.\nEven the politician’s character will change, because there will be no political parties. People will be choosing individually, there will be no political vested interest. Because of political parties the politician is bound to be cunning, exploiting, doing all kinds of things.\nJust a few days ago they imprisoned the Reverend Moon, because all the Christians were against him – he is a Christian, he comes from Korea – and he was attracting young people. The churches were against him because they were losing their sheep. And he is a perfect businessman, he has industries in Korea; he is a great salesman. He has been selling other things, but there is no better business than selling God. You don’t have to produce, you don’t need any factory; you don’t have to do anything. All that you need is to provoke people’s fear and greed. And he was collecting enormous amounts of money.\nAll the Christian churches were against him, parents were against him. They found a small flaw; that over three years’ time he has not paid seven thousand dollars of taxes. He is jailed. He fought in many courts, but finally the Supreme Court refused to consider the case.\nThe vice president of America has not paid fifty thousand dollars in taxes – no punishment! The government simply said it was an “oversight.” Fifty thousand dollars is an oversight – seven thousand dollars, and you are in prison for eighteen months!\nIt amazes me. It is a beautiful thing to look around.… The same churches who were against Reverend Moon – in fact, these churches forced the tax department and the government: “This man should be punished. He is putting the money given to the church into his own account.” Now he is punished, and he is punished only because he is not an American. Otherwise American law provides that if a man fails to pay two thousand dollars per year he can be forgiven; he can be given a chance. There is no need to punish him, he should just give the money to the tax department.\nOver three years’ time, seven thousand dollars is not much of a crime. He should be given a chance to give the money – and he was ready to. These churches forced the government, because they wanted him to be punished, so that his congregation disperses. Now the same churches are making an appeal; they have made a protest that his case should be reconsidered.\nI have seen the whole list. All kinds of churches, Christian associations, have signed it. They are all religious organizations with one exception: it has been signed by the state of Oregon also! That is something really great. What has the state to do with it?\nThe State is fighting against us, saying that we are mixing state and religion. In fact, there is no state here, no religion here, just individuals, utterly independent, living together because they feel a certain affinity. Just because of their experiences, they find it easier to be with people who are peaceful, silent, meditative. It helps them also in return to become more meditative. I call this the Buddhafield. A certain energy is created by so many people, which can trigger anybody into going i nwards.\nThe state of Oregon is in favor of Reverend Moon; it says that he should not be punished. This is not in any way the concern of the state. It means that the state does not believe the federal courts, does not believe that those courts are fair. It is a contempt of the federal courts to protest.\nAnd why with all those churches? Is the state of Oregon a church? And what authority have they got? We are also part of the state of Oregon. We have not been asked – how can they sign it on our behalf? They should have asked the whole state.\nThey did not protest when scientologists were punished, because they were not Christians. Other religious groups have been punished, forced, harassed; the state of Oregon has never signed a protest. And they are protesting because the man is a Christian – one thing.\nThe second thing: Why are all these churches protesting? These were the people who forced the government in every possible way, so that Reverend Moon should be either imprisoned or deported. They are protesting now because if Reverend Moon is a criminal by not giving seven thousand dollars to the tax department, is a criminal because he was putting the church money, corporate money, in the banks under his own name... all these churches and their bishops are doing the same!\nAfter this decision of the courts that Reverend Moon should be punished, sent to jail, they must have freaked out, because they have been doing the same thing on a larger scale. Bishops have bank accounts through which church money moves. Seeing the possibility that this may create a trouble for all the church leaders, now they are protesting on behalf of the same man they were trying to have punished. Do you see the cunningness?\nAnd only Christian churches have signed it. No Jews have signed it, no Mohammedans have signed it. And amongst those churches, the state of Oregon looks simply odd. Is it a church? And they are saying to us that we are mixing church and state! In fact, that’s what they are doing. Because they are basically Christian, they don’t want some Christian leader to be punished.\nAnd a state trying to save someone who has committed a crime is strange. The state government of Oregon seems to be a Christian state. Their hostility to us has no other base except that we don’t belong to any religion, that we have dropped all kinds of superstitions.\nI have the whole vision of the New Man: No religions, no nations, no governments – only one functional government, and a powerful world academy of scientists. And science should be the decisive factor.\nDon’t be afraid. Scientists are not monsters, scientists are very humane. And if meditation goes on flowering and sannyasins go on growing, scientists will be the first people to be interested in the inner journey. They need it; otherwise their lives are unbalanced. They are only going out, out, out. They need certain methods so they can go inwards and keep a certain balance. And a meditative scientist cannot conceive of creating monsters, murderers.\nScience has been a blessing to man. It can be a greater blessing if there is only one world.\nCHAPTER 32\nGod: the need of the old man\n30 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nMY MEMORY OF MY PARENTS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IS SO ALIVE. MY FATHER PAINTED AND WROTE POETRY. MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME DANCING. BOTH OF THEM WERE AGNOSTIC, AND NEVER TAUGHT ME RELIGION. NOW DIVORCED, THEY EACH LIVE IN QUIET DESPERATION, UNWILLING TO TAKE CHANCES. FOR ME THEY HAVE DIED AND ARE JUST SHELLS OF FEAR. THIS MAKES ME SAD, BECAUSE ONCE THEY FLOWED WITH JUICE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM?\nIt is a complicated question. In the first place, you do not know the meaning of agnosticism. Just not to teach you religion is not agnosticism. Just not to believe in religion is not agnosticism. If you call it agnosticism, you will have to use the word “negative”; it is negative agnosticism.\nThe positive agnostic is a seeker, and he goes on seeking, risking everything to find the truth, the life.\nIt is so easy to be a negative agnostic; not much intelligence is needed for that. All religions are so full of rubbish that any man of average intelligence can see it. And seeing it, he becomes non- religious. Your parents must have been of the same kind. Religions were wrong – that was their intellectual standpoint. But they never tried to fill the vacuum that religion was occupying. They threw the baby out with the bath water.\nTo be an agnostic means tremendous search. You have not to believe, and you have not to disbelieve either. The negative agnostic disbelieves; and there is not much difference between belief and disbelief. The religious person believes in God, the irreligious person does not believe in God, but their beliefs and their disbeliefs are only mental games. Neither of them has searched, meditated, gone deeper into his own center. To be an agnostic needs tremendous courage, immense energy and patience.\nAnd when the agnostic comes to the center of his being, certainly he finds there is no God, because the moment you know your center, you have known the center of the whole existence. On the periphery we are separate, but our separation is only at the circumference. As you go on moving towards your own self, you are coming closer and closer to other people’s selves. Ultimately when you reach to the center, you are amazed: there is no God, but there is tremendous beauty, incalculable silence.\nIf their agnosticism were what I am defining it to be, they would not have been in desperation. The agnostic can never live in desperation. Either he is involved in the great search of what it is all about He has no energy for desperation, he is pouring his whole effort into one single dimension:\nhe wants to know.\nThe agnostic is not the end of the search. It is just the beginning.\nThe agnostic cannot say there is no God, there is no heaven, no hell. That is what the atheist goes on doing. Perhaps your parents were atheists. The atheists are bound to come someday to deep despair. As death comes close by, they start trembling. They have not believed in God, they have disbelieved in religion. It was good when they were young, but before death almost all atheists become theists, they start believing. A simple arithmetic.…\nDeath is there. What is beyond they don’t know. They don’t know themselves. It was easier when they were young, hot. They enjoyed criticizing, they enjoyed destroying arguments of those who believe. And it is very easy to destroy their arguments. God is not an argument. At the moment of death, as they become older and the gap between them and death is becoming less and less, they freak out. Now they are no longer young, no longer hot. They have become just cold, shrunken, and death scares them.\nNow the only way is to accept religion, because religion is a kind of opium. It helps you to forget your despair, your anguish. It helps you to hallucinate whatsoever you want. And the reasoning is: “If there is no God, there is no harm. By becoming a theist, if there is a God, then we can say, ‘Forgive us, we were too young, inexperienced. Knowing nothing, we started disbelieving in you.’” And all the religions teach that God forgives those who ask for it.\nIt is simple. Whether he is or not, is not the question. The person is going to die and has to face the reality – if he survives death, with what face is he going to encounter God? This is the despair of your parents. Young, they were painters and poets and dancers. It is easy, when you are young, to do all kinds of foolishnesses. And when you do not believe in the religion people all around you are believing in, you have a certain satisfaction that you are unique, individual. You assert your uniqueness. It is nothing but an ego number.\nIn youth, everybody thinks he is a great painter, a great poet, a great musician. Youth is blind – it is just the energy of nature which is overflowing in you. And you are not even concerned with death, it is too far away. There is a certain limit beyond which you cannot be worried. You can worry for tomorrow, you can worry for the day after tomorrow, but are you going to worry about the coming year? Are you going to be worried about the coming century? You will say, “Today is so much, tomorrow is close by – who cares about the coming century?”\nOne person has asked, “Osho, is it not enough to be with You and enjoy, rather than thinking of the\nfuture of humanity?”\nHe himself is in doubt; otherwise from where does the question arise? Who is telling you to be worried about the future of humanity? It is enough if you can manage your life; the future will come out of it. Tomorrow is going to be born out of today. Whatever you are doing today will create your tomorrow. Once you know the secret, you are not only enjoying here, you are also creating the future.\nThe way the question is asked it seems you must be worried about the future of humanity. You want my approval: that it is perfectly okay, don’t feel guilty, just enjoy this day with me. Your question does not need an answer, your question needs approval.\nBut in youth, death is almost non-existential. You cannot disregard it when you get older. Your parents must be getting older. Their youth is finished, the love between your mother and father is finished – that too was there because they were young. In old age everybody would like to be divorced, not only from his wife, but from womankind as such.\nYouth is the time of romance. That’s why young people have never been taken seriously. The elders, the old people who have passed through all experiences of life, have been respected throughout history. You will not find a single civilization where the young man was respected – just tolerated; he was only a nuisance and nothing else. But the old people knew – they were also young once, they have also befooled themselves in many ways: “There is nothing to worry about, these young people will also get over their romantic ideas, ideas of revolution, of the future of mankind.”\nAs death comes, you will shrink to a single question: What is beyond death, what is going to happen? If there is a God, then I am doomed – my whole life I denied him.\nIf there is no God, that too is scary. Then you will become a ghost, without a body, a consciousness who wants things but cannot get them, because things are material and the ghost is not material, he has no material body. This is one possibility, which is not very appealing.\nAnd ghosts have never been known to paint, or to compose poetry, music. They have never been known to dance and enjoy. Ghosts don’t fall in love, for the simple reason that the ghost has lost the body, the biology, the physiology; he is just a shadow.\nIt is not appealing to become a ghost and wander around hungry for all the things that he had desired in life. He would like to have a woman, but in ghosts I have never heard that there is any sexual difference. They are all alike. There is no beautiful ghost, and there is no ugly ghost; there is no male ghost, there is no female ghost. And they are stuck with all kinds of desires.\nNo, no old man would like to live like that; it is better to die completely. Death should be total, not only of the body but of the soul too. That will be a great relaxation, because if you are not, who is going to worry?\nJust think back: when you were not born, do you remember that you were very much concerned about things – nuclear weapons, world war, Ethiopia? And do you think that before your birth, when you were non-existential, there was any problem? There was no problem. Not to be is the end of all problems, all sufferings, all misery.\nBut if there is a God, the old man who has denied him all his life is in despair. He cannot say now that God exists. It goes against his ego which he has cultivated for seventy, eighty years. And now he cannot stand up so strongly for his disbelief either.\nIt is my experience that any atheist I have come across is always young. I have never come across an old man who is an atheist. It is a similar case: you never come across an old man who is a hippie. To be a hippie you need to be between twenty-five and thirty-five. For those ten years you have strength to fight the society, to go against its morality, to do things which are not allowed – to take drugs It is a challenge.\nBut as you go on growing, nearabout between thirty-five and forty the hippie disappears. Suddenly thousands of hippies simply disappear. Now that youthful, romantic ideology of free love, drugs, not caring about anything, is not possible. You are becoming older; you need a home, you need a wife to look after you. You need children, because they will be, in a subtle way, tremendously satisfying. You know that you will die, but at least you will live in your child. The child is part of you. Even if a part is saved, it gives consolation.\nYour parents in your childhood were young, full of romantic ideas. In fact, the young man wants to be recognized, his greatest need is attention. If you are a theist, who is going to give you any attention? There are millions of theists, it is a very common thing. But to be an atheist – you immediately start getting attention. That fulfills the ego.\nAnd the trouble is that the atheist can always defeat any other kind of believers. The atheist can win in argument with any theist, because the theist has no evidence, no eyewitness about what happens after death, because nobody comes back after death and tells you stories about what is beyond death. So it is left up to your imagination. Of course, older people start imagining a God; otherwise they will be so helpless without the body – wandering like a cloud with no direction, no purpose. They need God. God is the need of the old man.\nChildren don’t care; they are forced to believe in God. The old man is again in a similar situation, but far more difficult and complex. A child can easily be molded; he is soft, vulnerable, imitative. The old man feels for seventy, eighty years he has been a certain kind of person. His personality has become consolidated, and now at the moment of death it is very difficult for him to undo himself. That is why the old are in despair.\nWhy did they get divorced? As youth leaves you one day, it takes many things from you; it does not go alone. It takes all your paintings, all your poetries, all your music, all your dances. It takes all your love, and leaves behind something utterly empty, dark, nobody to take care of. Children must have\nbeen grown up by now, they must be passing through revolutionary, rebellious stages – perhaps\nthey may be hippies. They don’t care about you; you have lived your life, they want to live their life.\nThey may be somewhere in Kabul, in Kulu Manali, in Kathmandu, in Goa – they are enjoying their youthfulness and its freedom, and they have energy to waste. They must be taking marijuana, hashish, opium, LSD. They don’t care even if they are imprisoned – I have known many people who have been imprisoned for using drugs which governments declare illegal. But imprisonment does not help. Out of the prison, they are again on the same track: Kabul, Kulu Manali, Kathmandu, Goa. Goa is their destination. These are just stopping, resting places; Goa is the final goal.\nBy the way, just a little drifting All the Christian countries are against marijuana, LSD, hashish, but\nthey are not against alcohol, which is far more dangerous to health. Why? – because Jesus himself was a drunkard, his apostles were all drinking. So alcohol has some religious significance for the Christians.\nThe Christian community or the Christian country cannot prohibit it. Prohibiting it, making it illegal, means you are raising questions against Christ and his behavior, you are doubting the great twelve apostles. And if Jesus can drink wine – not only that, if he changed water into wine – how can you say wine is illegal? If wine is illegal, then Christ was not doing a miracle but was committing a crime by turning water into wine.\nChristians accept alcohol – it is strange – and they deny LSD, for the simple reason that LSD was not available to Jesus Christ. Otherwise, I can say with certainty that Jesus Christ and all his apostles would have been taking LSD and real grass. They had to confine themselves only to alcohol; that was the only drug available.\nYou ask me what went wrong with your parents? Everything. First, they got married. If they were not married, at least they would have saved you from this life! And they were so much involved with painting, poetry, dances I have never heard their name as a great painter, or as a great poet, or as\na great dancer. But in youth the balloon of the ego is big. You write a third-rate letter and you call it a love letter. Most probably you have copied it from a third-rate novel, or from a movie.\nYou perform the act of love – it is some kind of exercise, it is not love. Real love is possible only to the meditator, that is his reward. A man who does not know himself, a woman who does not know herself – these two ignorant people fall in love with each other, and out of this ignorance you are born. And sooner or later, those two ignorant people become fed up with each other.\nNow your parents are living separately, alone, in despair, in desperation. What is their desperation? Now your father knows that his paintings are just stupid, these same paintings that looked as if a new Picasso is born. His poems look like rubbish. There is nothing in them, he was just putting words together in a certain order. These poems are created, composed, they have not been given birth.\nThe real poet gives birth to his poetry. He breathes it, his heart beats in it. In the moment he is pouring forth his poetry, his music, his dance, he is not there. If he is there, then the poetry and the dance and the music will remain mediocre. One has to disappear, one has to disappear in the act so totally that nothing is left behind.\nOne of the great poets, Coleridge, was asked by a professor, “I want to come and see you, because I am in trouble. Your poetry I have to teach to the students. There are a few lines, statements in your poetry, which I find difficult to explain. And the students are asking me. I feel embarrassed to say that I don’t know, and I am a D.Litt in literature! I thought it better I come to you and ask the meaning of those lines.”\nColeridge said, “You can come, but remember, I am also in great difficulty.” The professor said, “About your poetry you are in difficulty?”\nHe said, “Yes. When I wrote them, two persons knew the meaning of what I was writing: God and I. Now only God knows! I cannot figure out myself what the hell I have done.”\nAn authentic poet is not present, he gives way for the poetry to flow from him. And the same is true about music and dance, sculpture and architecture, about everything that is beautiful. If they come out of a meditative state, then they are not ego products. Ego products are going to be very ordinary.\nNow, let me come back.\nWhy have your parents divorced? You are asking me what has gone wrong. The romance is over. Romance is nothing permanent. It is just like the wind: it comes, you feel the coolness, the breeze, and then it is gone. It is like the flowers blossoming in the early morning sun – so beautiful, so colorful, so magical that even dewdrops on their petals look like pearls. But by the evening the petals are falling, the flower is disappearing.\nRomance is just a flower. It is not a coincidence that the hippies and their type of people were called flower people. They will blossom and they will disappear, there is no need to bother about them. It happens, this disease, to every young person.\nAnd if your mother was also a dancer, then certainly both were artists. It happens more to the artistic people. They are against the whole world, against everything, because they think they can create a new world. The old poetry, the old paintings are nothing to them, and their very ordinary painting is just the greatest piece of art.\nIn youth you can believe in anything. And when you can believe in your creativity, poetry, music, it is easy to drop believing in God, in religion, because you have found your own opium. You don’t need pope the Polack to supply opium to you. You grow your marijuana in your own garden; there is no need to get it from all kinds of peddlers. But one day youth is going to disappear. And the day youth disappears, you have entered into the arena of death. Old age is only a preparation for death.\nNow they must be feeling empty. Their art has failed, their love has failed, their revolution has failed, but their ego is still there. The ego cannot go against itself. If it has been atheist all its life, it cannot become suddenly theist. That is the desperation. Otherwise, just as youth has its opium, old age has its own opium: believe in God, believe in Jesus Christ, believe in the messiah – he will save you, he will take you into the kingdom of God.\nReverend Jim Jones managed to convince one thousand people that if they died with him, he would take all of them into paradise. He went a little farther than Jesus Christ. Jesus was saying, “At the time of judgment, the final day of judgment, I will choose my sheep and take them into paradise.”\nReverend Jim Jones is more progressive, more speedy, more American. “Why wait for the day of judgment? I am going, come along with me.” And all those people – most of them black, uneducated, uncultured, knowing nothing about existence, its experiences – they had heard only this fool, Reverend Jim Jones. They had followed him out of the country; then finally they followed him out of life.\nAnd it is a surprise that nobody criticized Christianity for it. Nobody could see a simple connection: that what Jesus was saying, this poor fellow, Reverend Jim Jones, was practicing, of course with more modern techniques. The people who died in Jonestown, they were given Kool-Aid to drink which was full of poison. Really contemporary! Jesus cannot be thought to have known anything about Kool-Aid.\nIt was tasty, and death was not a fear because the leader, the shepherd, was going with them, and he knew the way, he had a direct communication line with God.\nOn the contrary, Christians criticize me; they say that I am creating another Jonestown. They are responsible for Jonestown. They are responsible for so much violence in the whole history that it would have been a great blessing if the holy ghost had missed his target. The world would have been in a better condition without Christians. It will be, one day, in a better condition without all religions. In some way or other, they are all suicidal. A few, like Reverend Jones and his followers, do it quickly.\nJainas in India have followed the same idea for the thousand years at least: their monks fast unto death. It takes sometimes seventy days, eighty days, ninety days. The man goes on becoming a skeleton. His eyes go on deepening, becoming dark. He cannot move, he cannot speak. I don’t think after seventy days’ fast he recognizes anybody, or even knows what is happening, what he is doing. They have given it a beautiful name, santhara, and they think this is the greatest ascetic practice. It is a crime, but the Indian government cannot stop it: it is a religious crime and you are not supposed to interfere in religion.\nYour parents are feeling empty, trembling before death. All that was meaningful is no longer there. They are simply hollow. It is right that you say, for you they are dead. They are really living a ghostly life. On the one hand, their whole past does not allow them to change their minds. On the other hand, death, the darkening night. Death says it is better to change your ideology; perhaps there is a God, who knows?\nIf they were real agnostics, by this time they would have found what the truth is. The truth is godliness. Yes, there is no God, but there is a quality so high, so pure, so innocent, so fragrant, that once you have known it, you have known all that is worth knowing.\nIt is a quality. That’s why I emphasize again and again that if you meditate you will come to a space of godliness, but you won’t find an old man with a long beard, sitting on a golden throne, saying to you, “Hi! So at last you have come. How do you do?” No meditator in the whole of history has found any person. Yes, every meditator has found a tremendous experience of awakening, enlightenment, liberation.\nYour parents need meditation, otherwise they will die in tremendous despair and frustration. And meditation needs no belief system, so they need not drop their belief systems. Meditation does not\nrequire you to believe in God, heaven and hell. It requires nothing. It simply gives you a method which you can work easily.\nYou say that they are afraid to take any chances. Of course, they had lived with a certain disbelief for so long, and that disbelief and the philosophy they had woven around it have failed. And there is not much time left. Now to try anything new, naturally, they will feel afraid. They tried one thing their whole life, and it failed. Their paintings failed, their poetry failed, their philosophy failed, their music, their dance – they are bankrupt, spiritually bankrupt.\nIf you love them, if you have any feeling for them... and you must have, otherwise the question would not be raised. You may think they are dead, but you know they are not dead; they are dying. Then it becomes a responsibility for you.\nAt least they have done one favor to you – you have to accept the obligation – they never taught you any religion. It is time to help them. It is a great opportunity for paying back all the love that they have given to you when they were young. Teach them how they can meditate. And the way of meditation I am teaching you is very simple. If they can just watch their minds – and we are not asking much – if they can become just a witness, a watcher, the mind will slowly melt away as ice melts when the sun rises.\nMeditation is the only medicine for them now. If they can die meditatively, silently, blissfully – which is simple and possible – you will feel also relieved of a burden; otherwise, you will carry some burden on your soul, that you could not help them when they needed it.\nYou are asking, “They were so juicy – what has happened?” Everybody is juicy when they are young, youth brings all your juices to their peak. But youth is a fleeting phenomenon.\nI have heard about three old men: one was seventy, another was seventy-five, and the third was eighty-five. They were sitting in a park – and that was their routine, every day they would come. They had no work the whole day, so by the evening they would come and sit and talk about the past.\nThe old man has no future, he has only a long past. The child has no past, he has only a long future; hence children want to grow fast. Old people cling to the past: perhaps that will help against the oncoming death.\nSo they used to talk about beautiful moments in their life, difficult times in their life, successful moments in their life – most of which was exaggerated. It was their imagination that they were a great success when they were young, that they were this and that.\nThis evening when they met, the first old man, seventy, said, “One thing has been bothering me, and I would like to say it to you – it is almost a confession – so that I am relieved of it. I cannot go to the priest, he is just a young fellow – what does he know about religion? You are older than me, you have lived more, known more. I would like to confess to you.”\nThe other two became very excited. They said, “What is the thing that is bothering you? Tell it, get rid of it.”\nHe was very embarrassed, but he said, “The problem is that I was caught red-handed peeping through the keyhole of the bathroom, because a beautiful woman was the guest and I could not take myself away from the keyhole. And my grandmother caught me red-handed. I am ashamed.”\nThe two old people started laughing. One said, “You are a fool! Everybody does it, it is not a problem. In fact, why are keyholes made? This is their purpose, and we all have done it, so don’t be worried. And it is our experience, that from the keyhole of the bathroom, an ordinary, homely woman also looks like Cleopatra, because you cannot see exactly. It is vague. You can make it seem, through your imagination, as if a fairy has descended in the bathroom. We all have done it,” those two said, “you don’t be worried.”\nHe said, “You don’t understand me at all. It happened this morning!”\nThen they were a little shocked. This morning? At the age of seventy?\nThey said, “Naturally, it is understandable why you are feeling so much in the dumps. But, boy, get out of it. What has happened has happened. Next time, be careful. First watch about your grandmother, whether she is around or not; all that is needed is that little awareness. And find some excuse – drop your handkerchief on the floor. The moment your grandmother comes, start looking for the handkerchief, so you have an excuse: ‘The handkerchief had fallen and I was just picking it up. I have nothing to do with the keyhole.’”\nThe seventy-year-old man was very happy. He said, “Great idea! I never thought that some way I can manage an excuse to be there. This is great! I am completely unburdened. Now I will really be waiting for tomorrow morning. It will be difficult to sleep tonight. That woman is really great!”\nBecause he had opened a certain subject, the second man said, “I also have something to confess to\nyou. For almost five years I have been making love to my wife in a special way.”\nThey said, “What special way? You should have told us. Don’t you think we are your friends? You have found a special way, and you are keeping us in the dark? Tell us! What is the special way?”\nHe said, “It is nothing much. Before going to sleep I hold her hand, and press her hand two or three\ntimes, and then we go to sleep.”\nThe other two said, “This is a way of making love?”\nHe said, “What else to do? The trouble has arisen because once in a while I forget to press her hand, and she immediately starts nagging me, ‘It seems you are pressing some other woman’s hand! I will not allow this! You have to give an explanation. With whom are you making love nowadays?’”\nThe third man said, “You both are idiots – you think these are difficulties? I am eighty-five. I am feeling a real difficulty, and when you know about my difficulty you will forget all this nonsense of pressing hands, being nagged by the wife, becoming a Peeping Tom, finding some excuse.…” He said, “I never thought that you are so stupid.\n“The real trouble is with me. This morning when I started preparing to make love to my wife, she\nsaid, ’Have you gone mad? – because two times in the night you have done the same thing. And\nit does not suit you – an eighty-five-year-old man making love three times? You disturbed my sleep and I am fed up with you! I was hoping that now that we are getting old, this animal game will finish. You are getting older, and you are doing more and more the same thing that I was thinking would be finished!’”\nThe two were really amazed. They said, “You think this is trouble? This is great!”\nHe said, “It is a great trouble. In fact, my memory is failing – I didn’t have any idea that I had made love two times, I was thinking this is the first time. Your problems are nothing – my memory is just disappearing!”\nYour parents are old. They must be having many kinds of problems which only old people have. Help them to meditate a little bit. Perhaps they can get back the memory of those juicier days. Perhaps they can start painting again, and now it will be far better. Perhaps they can start music and dance, and now it will be better because it will be coming out of their meditation.\nEverything changes its quality the moment the meditator touches it. I say it to you on my own experience. I never quote the scriptures unless something is my own experience. For these thirty- two years or more, I have enjoyed food as I had never enjoyed before. Since enlightenment I have enjoyed everything so profoundly, so deeply that I feel sorry for the whole humanity. They also eat, but they go on doing many other things in their mind while their mouth is chewing. Their mind is engaged – how can they know the taste?\nThat’s why people eat too much. That’s why it is one of the biggest problems in rich countries. Women are dieting, men are dieting, doing exercises to make the body slim, because a fat man is declaring by his fatness that he is empty and filling that emptiness with food.\nAfter enlightenment, when you are eating you are simply eating. You are not there, there is only a process of eating. Then it becomes exactly like painting, when the painter is not there. It becomes like dancing, when the dancer disappears in the dance.\nI want to teach you that it is not only painters and dancers and singers that have the prerogative to enjoy life. It is everybody’s birthright – it has nothing to do with special talents. Cooking can be a joy, cleaning the house can be a joy.\nIt is all the same. What you are doing is not the point; the doer must be lost in doing, you should not remain separate. If you are separate, then of course, there is going to be boredom. Every day cleaning the house All housewives are bored, utterly bored. All men are bored: the same job, the\nsame stupid customers, the same wife at home. To a meditator, everything is beautiful.\nHe lives life in its abundance.\nI say to you, only the enlightened person can live luxuriously. Whether he has luxurious things around him or not does not matter. He has some inner change. His vision, his attitude, his approach to things is totally different from the average man or woman.\nHelp your parents. Pay the debt. And if you can see them again painting, dancing, perhaps they may fall again in love. Perhaps they will come closer to each other. My feeling is that people get divorced only because they both become too much to each other. It becomes simply impossible to live together, it becomes a constant harassment to both.\nIf you can introduce meditation... and I am certain they will welcome it, because they are in desperation. They need some help from somewhere. And if you cannot do it for them, who is gong to do it for them? And remember, meditation is not something that happens while you are young. It is not something like love, romance, great ideas about revolution.\nI was also young, and while I was studying, I had many friends. Somebody was a communist, somebody was a socialist, somebody was a fanatic Christian, somebody was a Hindu chauvinist, and they all were full of great ideas.\nThey used to ask me, “You don’t seem excited about the great problems the world is facing.”\nI said, “You leave me alone. I am working in a totally different dimension – you cannot understand it.\nBe a communist!”\nNow they all have disappeared in the crowd. Once in a while, if, by accident I met somebody, I would\nask him, “What happened to your communism?”\nHe would say, “Forget all about it! My wife is pregnant, four children I have already. Prices are going up, the rupee is shrinking smaller and smaller, and I am just a clerk. There is no time for me to think of communism. Those days are gone when I was trying to reach to the moon.”\nNone of the students – and there were thousands of students in the university – none, not a single one, has remained what he was in the university. Perhaps I am the only one amongst that whole crowd of socialists, communists, who has remained in the same dimension, going on and on; I have found the way to infinity.\nRemember, enlightenment is not something that happens as an incident and there comes a full stop, no. Enlightenment begins, but it never ends. It is an ongoing process. It becomes juicier and juicier.\nAnd when things go on becoming juicier and juicier, how are you going to go back? Who remembers the way back, the past? – because every day you are facing a new revelation, a new light, a new joy. Every day it is so fresh that there is no need to look backwards.\nThe enlightened man is a child forever.\nHe has only the future, and there is no limit to his growth. Perhaps even the sky has some limit, but enlightenment knows no limit.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nALL THE NEWS MEDIA ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SIXTH OF AUGUST, THE UNFORTUNATE DAY FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI WERE BOMBED WITH THE FIRST ATOM BOMBS. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, GOVERNMENTS ARE STILL SPENDING MOST OF THEIR MONEY MAKING THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nThe sixth of August can never be forgotten. That day we proved that civilization has not happened to humanity yet, that we are barbarians, that we are cannibals, that we are still animals. Darwin is wrong; the whole idea of evolution is just imagination.\nInstead of believing in Darwin, I believe in the monkeys, because monkeys also have their idea: they think man has fallen – and certainly he has fallen – from the trees. Falling from the height, you call that evolution?\nThe sixth of August proved the monkeys are right, because to drop atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the ugliest thing that man has done in the whole of history. Everything else paled before it. And the wonder of wonders is that it was not needed at all. Germany had already surrendered; the Japanese forces were almost finished. Perhaps without the dropping of the atom bombs the war may have continued one week more.\nThat would not have been a great calamity – people had been fighting for five years; for seven days more But that was the reason for dropping the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, because if\nthe war ended then you would never be able to drop the atomic weapons that you had. It was the time to make the world feel how much power and strength you had. America wanted it to be remembered that if Nagasaki and Hiroshima can disappear in smoke, then there is no problem: Moscow, New Delhi, London, Paris – any place can be evaporated within seconds.\nAmerican was trying to prove itself the greatest power in the world. It had nothing to do with the war, they were winning. Now, dropping atom bombs on people who are already losing every day – there cannot be any other reason.\nPresident Truman – and what a name he has got. Certainly he was a true-man. We should change his name to President True-monkey; that’s where he belongs. Even his military experts were not willing. They told him, “It is absolutely unnecessary, the war has really ended. It is only just a week’s work and Japan will surrender. Now that Germany has surrendered, Japan cannot survive; the basic power was Germany. And we are winning every day, so just wait seven days more. And if after seven days the war is not finished, you can drop atom bombs.”\nBut he did not listen, because there was some other motivation in dropping the atom bombs. It was not to win, they were winning already. The motivation was to make it clear to the whole world that now America is by far the biggest power. And just to prove this, two big cities, throbbing with life, were just destroyed.\nObviously, Japan surrendered immediately; otherwise Tokyo would go the same way as Hiroshima and Nagasaki had gone. And President True-monkey told his military experts, “See? The war is finished immediately. We don’t have to wait.”\nHiroshima and Nagasaki are wounds which have not healed yet. And rather than healing those wounds, America is piling up nuclear weapons. Naturally, afraid of America, Russia is doing the same; they are piling up nuclear weapons. In fact, it is now difficult to say who is more powerful, because about American things are known, how much power America has, but about Russia everything is secret. She may be more powerful, she may have more nuclear weapons. She may have new methods which are even superior.\nFor example, they have been trying, and perhaps they have succeeded, in creating death rays. No bomb is needed, certain rays are just directed towards the country. You will not see them, so you cannot protect yourself. When somebody is bombing, there is time – Russia cannot destroy the whole of America in a day, nor can America destroy Russia in a day. But death rays will kill people and nobody will be able to know what is happening. Suddenly the death ray hits your heart, you fall dead. It is an invisible way of killing, and as far as I know, there is as yet no way found to protect people against death rays.\nAnd because these two biggest powers in the world are continuing to create more and more destructive weapons, even small countries – just out of fear, the whole humanity is living in fear – countries which are starving, cannot manage even to survive, which perhaps will not be there to see the third world war at all, they are also trying to make atomic plants, nuclear plants. Their people are already dying and starving, and they are preparing death for others, knowing perfectly well that now there is no time to become in any way a great world power.\nRussia and America are so far ahead that by the time you reach that point, they would have moved again, miles further ahead. Now there is no way for them to catch up. It is sheer stupidity on the part of other countries to waste their money on nuclear weapons, for the simple reason that they can never be the top power. That is impossible; they don’t have the means, they don’t have the time.\nAnd it is stupid for America and Russia too, because they have already so much destructive energy in their hands that they can kill all living beings on the earth, from trees to man – everything that breathes. They both are ready enough to destroy life seven times over. Can you see any intelligence in making more weapons? Are not these enough? A man dies only once! And you are not the begotten son of God, that after death you will be resurrected with glory, so they will have to kill you again.\nBut I think the whole idea of resurrection of Jesus is a fiction. Yes, I know he did not die on the cross. It was a Friday, and that was chosen specially by Pontius Pilate. He was not a Jew, he had nothing against Jesus. He was simply worried that a young man, only thirty-three, innocent in every way – he has never committed any crime, he has never harmed anybody – is being crucified. And Pontius Pilate will be remembered always as the person who gave orders for the crucifixion.\nJudea was under the rule of the Romans and Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor general of Judea. He tried in many ways to free Jesus; first he tried to persuade the chief priest of the Jews, but they were adamant. Then he tried.… Three people were being crucified: two were criminals, murderers, and it was a custom that if the chief rabbi and the people wanted, one person could be forgiven. Pontius Pilate was hoping that the people would ask that Jesus be forgiven. He had not done anything wrong. But people asked that Barabbas should be forgiven. He was a confirmed criminal who had been to jail again and again many times. They asked that Barabbas should be released. So that second idea also failed.\nThen he tried a third method. On Friday Jesus was to be crucified. Pontius Pilate managed to delay the process as long as possible. Jesus was to be prosecuted and crucified in the morning, but Pontius Pilate was able to postpone it a little bit more: he had to ask the emperor, the message was coming, all the papers had to be filled in.\nJesus was crucified in the afternoon; this was a strategy – because the Roman way of crucifying a man is really barbarous, utterly inhuman. They nail the person’s hands on the cross, his feet on the cross; then slowly blood starts oozing out. It takes at least forty-eight hours of immense suffering for the man, and only then does he die.\nCrucifixion is not an electric chair, where before you know you are dead, you are dead – just a switch and you are finished. Even Adolf Hitler was more human, although he killed millions of Jews; but he had created gas chambers. People would go into the chamber, and within a minute you would see smoke rising above the roof: the people were gone. Thousands of people together, within a single minute, just evaporated.\nBut to hang a person and keep him hanging for forty-eight hours at least He will be hungry, he\nwill be thirsty – more so because blood is oozing out, there will be dehydration.…\nPontius Pilate managed to crucify Jesus in the afternoon. It was a custom of the Jews that on Saturday – that is their sabbath, their holy day – all work should stop, everything should stop. On the day of sabbath nothing is to be done. Pontius Pilate took advantage of this. He said, “If it is so, then Jesus should be brought down” – he was still alive, because blood was still oozing; when a man is dead, blood does not come out of the body. “So he should be brought down, and after three days, we will crucify him again.”\nHe was put in a cave with a big rock that single-handedly he could not remove. And after three days, the cave was found empty. This was not resurrection. This was Pontius Pilate and one of Jesus’ sympathizers who managed the whole strategy. First, you bring him down – he is still alive – put ointments on him, give him enough to drink, and then remove his body.\nJesus died in India in Kashmir. Naturally, those six hours on the cross gave him a great lesson. And he had seen that there is no God, he had seen that there is no miracle, he had seen that: “I was just crazy proclaiming myself as the only begotten son of God.” In India he lived really a long life – one hundred and twelve years, but in India he never said again, “I am the messiah, the prophet.” Those six hours took away all his fanatic ideas; those six hours brought him to his senses.\nHe was thirty-three when he was crucified. In India he lived to one hundred and twelve years. He escaped Judea, because if he was in Judea he would be crucified again. The experience of six hours on the cross was enough. He did not want to do any more teaching, preaching. He did not want anymore to be the savior. In fact, he saved himself, just in time. He remained there with a small group of followers, but no promises of the kingdom of God. He had promised that, and he had seen the result.\nThat’s why the world does not know what happened to Jesus after crucifixion. And Christians took the opportunity to claim that he was resurrected, because the cave was found empty. But his grave exists in Kashmir.\nI have been to his grave, and it is an absolute proof, because on the grave the writing is in Hebrew. Nobody knows Hebrew in India. Mohammedans also make graves, but their graves always point towards Mecca, their holy city. There are only two graves in India – one of Moses and the other of Jesus – which are not pointing towards Mecca. And on both the inscriptions are in Hebrew.\nOf course, Jesus Christ is not named on that grave, because in Hebrew his name was Joshua, not Jesus. Jesus is a Greek translation of Joshua. And Christ is not used, because Christ is also a Greek word for messiah. So on the grave you will not find the name of Jesus Christ, you will find the name Joshua, the messiah. But that is the Hebrew name by which he was known to his people.\nHiroshima and Nagasaki create a division in history. And now, to go on piling up more and more weapons of destruction, just out of fear Even India wants a nuclear plant. The difficulty is that one\nof the most important things needed to make nuclear weapons is uranium, and uranium is found only in Russia and America. So anybody who wants to create a nuclear plant has to depend on these two powers.\nAmerica has bigger resources for uranium, so although India deep down condemns America, it cannot declare openly that “We are not with America,” because from where are they going to get the uranium? Russia has only enough for itself; otherwise Russia would have provided the uranium for India.\nAnd the situation is absurd. When you have already enough to destroy every man seven times, then stop everything! All the energy should move to provide people with more comfort, more education, more health, more medicine. And this is so simple.\nPeople go on asking me, “Don’t you have any compassion for Ethiopia? What are your people doing for Ethiopia?” I am not so unintelligent as to send you to Ethiopia to serve the poor people there who are starving. The crisis has been going on for four years, because for four years there have been no rains. I don’t feel responsible at all for Ethiopia, or India.\nThere are two kinds of people who are responsible, and on this sixth of August, those two categories should take the responsibility to see that things like Hiroshima and Nagasaki never happen again.\nWho are these two categories? One is the politicians. They should stop – not a semicolon, a full stop. No more money goes into making destructive things, no money goes into the service of death. And you should remember, seventy-five percent of the energy of all the nations is going into the service of death. This seventy-five percent of the energy should become available to the poor, the downtrodden. And can you imagine? Seventy-five percent of the finances, if released from the service of death, can make this earth a paradise.\nThis sixth of August.… The second category is that of priests of all religions, who are teaching people that birth control is against God, that abortion is a crime, is a sin. These are the people who are helping the population grow faster and faster. These people should be behind bars: the pope, his bishops, the shankaracharya, the imam, Mother Teresa – certainly at least one woman should be included with these criminals. They all should be in prison. Leaving them out is leaving ferocious animals without chains in the society. They go on helping the population to grow, and the population goes on creating more poverty.\nI am not responsible. For thirty years I have been continuously teaching that the pill is the greatest revolution after the discovery of fire. Nothing else in between is of any importance. Birth control is your birthright. It is up to you to decide, because there is no God who is deciding. You have to take the responsibility upon yourself.\nWe are in our own ways trying to raise the consciousness around the world to prevent the politicians from creating more destructive weapons. And whatever nuclear energy, atomic energy, is available should be used for creative purposes. The same energy can bring clouds over Ethiopia; the same energy can stop floods in India. Energy is always neutral. It depends on you for what purpose you are going to use it.\nThe politicians are responsible – and the religious leaders. I am not responsible at all, because for thirty years I have been teaching in favor of birth control, the pill and other methods. And I have been teaching against atomic energy. But if people don’t listen then it is their responsibility.\nIf Ethiopia dies, it is not my responsibility; it is the responsibility of Ethiopia itself. If India dies, it is not my responsibility. They should hang their shankaracharyas who are responsible for poverty in India. They should tell their politicians, “We don’t need nuclear plants.” India is dying, half of India is starving, and the wheat is being exported, because only by exporting wheat and other things which their own people need, can India arrange finances enough to make nuclear plants.\nThese politicians should be forced: “Either stop all efforts for war, or get down from your seats. We\nwill find other presidents, other prime ministers.”\nThe sixth of August should be a day of declaration against the politicians and the priests.\nCHAPTER 33\nYou are my fellow travellers\n3 1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO\nNEVER HAVE YOU SEEMED SO HUMAN, DANCING, LAUGHING AND CELEBRATING WITH US. BUT NEVER HAVE YOU TOLD IT TO US QUITE SO STRAIGHT, WITHOUT CATERING TO OUR UNENLIGHTENED MORTAL STUPIDITIES. IS THIS THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY VIBE?\nYou got it! This is the twenty-first century for me, and I am trying to push you towards it.\nSannyasins should live ahead of time. The people who are burdened with the past live five thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, and they are stuck there.\nYou cannot live with the past. The past is dead, and to live with the past is to be dead. The only life possible is in the present, and the future is always changing into the present. It is always making the twenty-first century in the twentieth century. The farther ahead you can live in the moment, the more alive you will feel. And remember, it is better to be red than dead!\nI had to wait for you to behave humanly. I was waiting for my people, because only they will understand that to be human is the highest value there is.\nI was talking to the Christians, to the Hindus, to the Mohammedans, to the Jainas, to the Buddhists, and it was a difficult job. I could not behave humanly with them. They wanted me to be their messiah, their prophet, their messenger.\nJust the other day I received two letters. One was from a woman in California. She said, “I have loved you for many years. I have been reading all your books – how beautiful it was when you spoke on Jesus! And now after three years of silence, what you are saying has enraged me so much that I have burned all your books. I will pray to Jesus Christ and God to forgive you. Perhaps you should go into silence again. And if you don’t go into silence, then there is only one possibility for you to be saved: that is, when you expire the silence will descend on your grave.”\nNow this woman had all my literature, had loved me, she thinks. But do you think she loved me? She loved Jesus Christ, and because I had spoken on Jesus Christ, putting myself behind him. putting my gun on his shoulder, she was happy, immensely happy and grateful. The poor woman is not aware of the fact that she had never been in tune with me. Because I was speaking on Jesus as no one had spoken before, I was supporting her mind, her tradition, and she was feeling immensely happy. I was fulfilling her ego.\nNow she is so against me, she has burned all the books, and she is praying to Jesus Christ, the God, to forgive me. She should also burn the house in which my books have been. They have already infected the air and the house.\nWhenever you feel that you are supported in some way, you are happy. Hindus were happy, Mohammedans were happy, Christians were happy – everybody was happy. And I am not here to make you happy.\nI want you to be blissful. I want you to know yourself, to know this vast existence. And you cannot know it being a Christian or a Hindu. Your eyes are covered with layers of dust that centuries have poured over you.\nNow she is feeling very offended, but still she cannot see the point. I had to speak on Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, and hundreds of other prophets, messiahs, saviors. But that speaking was very difficult for me, it broke my back, because I was doing something which was against my own nature. I was sorting out sentences from Jesus; those which I could not support I never mentioned. Those which I could support, I supported them with all the growth of the twenty centuries after him.\nNaturally many Christians, priests, bishops, were influenced. They could not believe that a man who is not a Christian has such great insight into Jesus, his words, his implications. It was not like that. I was using Jesus only to catch fish in the big ocean of Christianity; I have done that with all the religions. And then for three years I became silent, just to know how many people were hanging around my words because they supported their belief system.\nIn my silence this woman was happy. She said, “While you were silent, I loved you. Since you have started speaking again you have destroyed my love.” So those who were here for their own ego fulfillment.… And the ego cannot be fulfilled by my silence; the ego need words, theologies, philosophy. She wants me to become silent again. She is furious. She wants me to be dead, but to be silent.\nSo in these three years I have sorted out my people, who can be with my silence. That means it does not matter to them whether I speak or not. It does not matter to them whether I say something which is against their conditioning or favoring their conditioning. They love me, not my words. Their communion is heart to heart.\nAnd when I saw all the camels have moved towards Santa Fe – Santa Fe has become a great camel camp – I thought that the moment has come to speak directly to you. And now I will be speaking directly to you.\nThere will be no Jesus between me and you, no Buddha between me and you, just a pure communion. Only then can I reach to your heart; otherwise, I can reach only to your mind – and mind has no function in bringing you blissfulness, ecstasy, enlightenment. Mind can give you better technology, but it cannot give you the New Man.\nI feel sorry for the woman, but she should understand that it is all her doing. I don’t know her even, she is not a sannyasin. And her love was false; she was still a Christian, and she was being supported by my meanings that I had put through Jesus’ mouth.\nI know I have been doing a very risky job. If ever Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira meet me, they are all going to attack me and kill me. They will forget all their messages of love, their messages of peace. And it will not be only Mohammed, it will be all those whom I have used. But there is no possibility of meeting these guys again.\nNow I can be human to you. I always wanted to be an authentic human being. There was never a desire to be a prophet, a messiah, an avatar, a godman. To me, all these words are four-letter words. I wanted just to be simple, ordinary – the way I am. I wanted to expose my heart to you without thinking what is going to be the consequence. This was possible only when I had found my own people, who can understand.\nYou are fortunate that you have remained. All the sannyasins around the earth are fortunate, because what they have listened to before was not the truth. I tried hard to put the truth... I interpreted those people, who were just crackpots – but it was compulsory. In this vast world, it is very difficult to find your own people. They are already belonging to some group, some theology, some religion. They have their own church, their own mosque, their own temple, and they have great investments there. They are hoping to attain paradise; they are afraid of falling into hell.\nWe are not interested in heaven and hell or God. There is no need to go to hell to experience it – you can just go driving on the county road and you will know what kind of roads exist in hell. You need not travel long to heaven – you can be just here, dancing, singing, rejoicing, and you know heaven has come to you.\nI emphasize the fact that nobody ever goes to heaven or hell. It is just vice versa: Hell comes to you, heaven comes to you. It is your doing, it is your heart that attracts it.\nHell is your misery, your suffering. Heaven is your rejoicing.\nI have also received another letter, one from a Zen master who wants to come and see me. And you will see the difference between a Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu, and a Zen monk.\nThe Zen monks have emphasized that they do not belong to Buddhism. In fact, Zen is a revolt against Buddhism. Buddha would not approve of these people, they are too human. They are so simple: chopping wood, drawing water from the well – you cannot conceive Buddha doing that.\nThis Zen master gives you a totally different vision. He is happy that I am here. He is immensely rejoiced that somebody is here who can even prevent the third world war. He just wants to sit by my side, to feel the vibe. He also knows what I am saying. He is also reading my books and he had read my old books too. But now he has decided that the time has come, that he should come here, because now I am speaking on my own authority. Now it is worth being close to a man who is not a commentator, but is an enlightened soul.\nHe says in his letter that Buddha had declared that he would be coming again after five thousand years. Twenty-five centuries have passed. The Zen monk declares, “We are exactly in the middle: twenty-five centuries back there was a Buddha, and perhaps twenty-five centuries ahead there will be a Buddha. And you seem to be the bridge, just exactly in the middle – twenty-five centuries.” He says he has not seen Buddha, but he would like to meet me, to have some taste of buddhahood, awakenedness.\nThis man has a totally different approach. He is a man of understanding, meditation. If he ever wants to burn, he will burn the old books and save the new ones, because the old books were commentaries, which I had to make under compulsion. Now it is no longer a commentary, I am telling you my experience. If Jesus or Buddha or Zarathustra agrees with me, good; if they don’t agree, they can go to hell.\nThey had all pretended to be higher than you, holier than you, more special than you. They fulfilled a great need in you: you wanted to follow somebody who was the only begotten son of God. By following the son of God you were also participating in something divine. I have dissolved the very idea of following. You are my fellow travelers.\nI want it to be declared throughout the earth, to all the corners of the earth, that someone has transcended, for the first time, even the experience of enlightenment – because that too is a way of creating distance, great distance: I am enlightened, you are not enlightened; I am always right, you are always wrong.\nYou are right as much as I am right. Accept the responsibility of your actions, of your thoughts, of your being, and fight every kind of trespass. You have to be yourself. If you cannot accept me being as human as you are just because I am enlightened, then I throw that enlightenment away. But I cannot allow you to be humiliated in a subtle way; I cannot allow you to go on becoming bigger egos. To hell with enlightenment!\nAnd I will do everything that will destroy it. No Buddha has laughed. What kind of miserable creatures...? No Buddha has danced. No Buddha has sung.\nYou just wait! You will be the first ones to see a buddha dancing. As your laughter and your love are making me stronger, soon I am going to dance. You should not be surprised when someday I appear in your disco or your playing cards room! I want to erase all kinds of stupidities that have arisen in the past, and have become bigger and bigger as time has passed.\nMy sannyasins and I are not different. Your faults are my faults, your errors are my errors. I accept you as you are; remember it, because if I come to your disco perhaps you will not be ready to accept me. I am preparing you for that, I don’t want you freaking out. It has been a long and hard struggle for me to find my people, I am not going in any way to freak them out.\nSlowly, slowly you will get accustomed to the idea that an enlightened man can come to a disco, dance with you, play cards with you, drink a little champagne with you. You should be immensely happy that you are with a man who claims no holier-than-thou attitude. It is ugly. There is nobody above human beings.\nI have always loved one statement of Chandidas. He was thought to be mad, because he declared: sabar uppe manu sut, tahar uppe nain – “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”\nAlthough he was in the past, I can recognize him as belonging to us, he is a contemporary. And he is courageous enough to enter the twenty-first century with us. What a great statement! SABAR UPPE MANU SUT... “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.” He dissolved all gods, all angles. He recognized that man’s consciousness is the highest.\nYou don’t see it because you are asleep, but there is not much difference between the man who is asleep and the man who is awake. The man who is awake was asleep just few moments ago, the man who is asleep may be awakened just in a few moments, but there is no basic difference.\nI would like you to accept me as an ordinary human being. I don’t want to be a leader, I don’t want\nyou to be led. I simply want to dance amongst you, completely lost.\nYou need not be afraid of me. All the followers of Jesus Christ were afraid of him, Buddha’s followers were afraid of him – because these people have been continuously nagging their disciples. I think if Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Krishna had been housewives, the world would have been far better. They would have nagged only one man, not the whole of humanity. I hate nagging!\nWhen I was a child and lived in a very small village where no train passes, no buses reach, my grandfather had a beautiful white horse. I used that white horse for roaming around the town, going along the river, going around the big lake. Slowly, slowly the horse started feeling some synchronicity with me. He started feeling when I wanted to return. But I never nagged even that horse. If he wanted to go north, I said, “Okay.” If he wanted to go around the lake, I said, “Okay, you decide, but I am not going to nag you against your wishes.”\nAnd it was a strange thing, that he always went to the place where I wanted to go. Between his consciousness and mine, something must have been transpiring. There was a communion without words. And if a horse can go to the place where I want, without my nagging and forcing him to go there, certainly... even if I am amongst you, don’t be afraid. All that is needed is not a superman to lead you, but a man with whom you can have a synchronicity. A subtle vibe of love joins you and me, and it will do miracles.\nI have been receiving letters from sannyasins: “It feels tremendously beautiful to see you as a human being just like us, but still somewhere I want you to be extraordinary, not ordinary. I want you to be higher than your disciples.” Why?\nMy being higher simply makes it difficult to communicate. That’s why all these people have failed. Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Confucius, Lao Tzu – they all have failed, for a simple reason: they were there sitting on the clouds, and you were crawling on the earth. What communication is possible?\nThey maintained the distance; it was the fulfillment of their egos. And you stupidly wanted your prophet’s cloud to be higher than those of other prophets. But do you know what it means? It means your communication with your leader, prophet, messiah, is even more difficult.\nAll the religions have been trying to prove they are higher. Buddhists say, “Buddha is higher than Jesus, than Moses, then Mahavira.” And the other people are doing the same. I am starting a new history as far as enlightenment is concerned. The closer I am to you, holding your hand and dancing, the more is the possibility of communication.\nI am going to wake you, because I am so close to you. If I can dance with you, you cannot remain asleep long; it is risky for you and your sleep! If I can drink a little champagne with you, then our hearts can melt into each other.\nYou need not look above to God the father, who is always above the roofs – I don’t know what he is doing there! You can see me, look into my eyes, because I am standing on the same ground as you are. There is no distance, only a little difference – so little that I don’t care much about it.\nYou will be awakened. When I am so close to you, it is impossible for you to go on sleeping. I can shake you, I can hit you – I am so close. I can throw cold water in your eyes – I am so close. Buddha cannot do it; he is sitting on a white cloud far away.\nBut that has been the conspiracy between the masters and the disciples. The disciple really loves the master to be far away. That gives him a satisfaction: “I am no ordinary man’s follower, I follow an extraordinary master. Naturally, I am an extraordinary disciple.”\nIf you are with me, a man who says that he is an ordinary human being, I am destroying your ego. You cannot be an extraordinary disciple, you have to be ordinary. If your master himself is ordinary, what can you do? You have to be ordinary.\nAnd this is my basic experience, that to be ordinary is the most beautiful thing in existence. To be ordinary means to be relaxed. There is nowhere to go, nothing has to be found; you have it already. It was your ego that was blocking the way. Now the ego has disappeared, and you can see to your innermost being, crystal clear.\nSeeing it, you are going to laugh – what a joke life has played upon you! Life has put the kohinoor inside you, and given you the desire to search for the kohinoor. And you are running all over the world – to the churches, to the synagogues, to the monasteries, and doing all kinds of stupidities to find that which you have never lost, to find that which even if you want to lose, you cannot. It is your very being.\nI have heard about a man who was walking in the desert all alone... desert as far as he could see. It was his own shoes making noise – that was the only noise – but it appeared as if somebody was following him. It takes a little time; sound travels six hundred miles per hour, so when your shoe makes some sound you don’t hear it instantly, there is a gap. By the time you hear it your shoe has moved.\nHe was a logical, philosophic man. Certainly it was not the sound of his shoes; somebody was following him. He looked behind, saw his own shadow and figured out that this shadow seemed to\nbe some kind of ghost, because shadows are not known to make noise. He started running and the sound became louder. He looked back – the shadow was also running faster. He said, “My God! It means I am not running fast enough!”\nHe did his best, till he was almost spent and fell under a tree near an oasis. Now he was even more afraid, but he looked around: there was no noise, and the shadow was not there, for the simple reason that he was under the shadow of the tree. His shadow was so clear-cut under the sun on the sand, and here, when he was sitting under the tree, the shadow had left. He laughed. He understood that he had been making the noise himself, and the faster he ran, the louder the noise became – and it was his own shadow.\nThe moment you become enlightened, the first thing will be a mad laughter – that this is the thing you have been searching for for many lives, and you had it always in your pocket! All that is needed is just a little shaking. And I have found many ways to shaking you, to help you\nopen your eyes. And it is not a difficult job, in fact it is a great joy.\nTry with some sleeping man just brushing his cheeks with a toothbrush slowly, and see what happens to him – how he tries to throw it away. Just tickle his feet, and he pulls up his leg. Just start playing with his belly, and he is bound to open his eyes – how long can he keep them shut? How long can he remain asleep? What is going on? And he will also join in your laughter.\nI want you to live abundantly, with great laughter, rejoicing, and the only possibility is if your ego is destroyed. And the best way I have found is that I should be amongst you, not leading you, so that you forget completely that you are followers of a great master. I am perfectly ready to be your follower: you can walk ahead and I can follow you and do all kinds of tricks from the back – which is easier!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nA LONG TIME AGO I REPLACED THE WORD GOD WITH SIMPLY “IT.” IT IS ABOUT AS VAST AS I CAN GO WITH MY MIND. DO I NEED TO ABOLISH IT AS WELL? – BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE AND ALL AROUND ME.\nThe first thing to be understood is that changing names does not change anything. You can call it God, you can call it Allah, you can call it Ishwar – there are three hundred languages on the earth. There are three hundred ways to call God, or you can invent your own private name for God.\nYou say, “I have replaced God with the word ’It.” What does it mean? You have only changed the label. Perhaps you can change even the container, but the question is of the content. And the content is there, I can see from your question, because you say, “it is alive and all around me.” Now, “it” is used for things. You have changed just the word; you are giving him a new name, but “It” is all alike.\nAnd the second thing you say is, “This is as far as my mind can go.” That’s true. Mind can play with words, that’s as far as it can go. It can never attain to the state of wordlessness. Your “It” will dominate you, will keep you in slavery just as God has done for so long.\nAnd the third thing... you ask me, “Should I drop ‘It’ also?” No, because then you will replace it by\nanother word.\nThe women’s liberation movement uses for God, “She.” And I think it is a better word than “he”, because in “she,” “he” is present, but in “he”, the “she” is absent. “She” is a bigger word. It is symbolic: in “woman” the man is there, but in the word “man,” the woman is not there. But basically it does not make any difference – you can call God “she.” So I will not tell you to drop calling God “It.” It is not going to help in any way.\nI would like you to drop the mind which is playing this game of changing one word for another. Drop the mind! Nothing else can help. Forget about God. You don’t know him, you have not met him – how can you change his name, his address?\nYou are not to trespass the boundary. You cannot take it into your own hands, how God should be called. You don’t know anything about God, and you will never know, because God does not exist at all. So you are changing the name of something non-existential.\nIf you are so good at dropping from “he” to “It”, if you can even drop God from “he” to “It”he\nstands for something, someone alive. It is used for things. If you can do such a great job, pulling down God from his golden throne, and making him a commodity in the market, then you can do a far easier thing: drop the mind.\nIt is a mind game, and the mind can play thousands of games. You reduce God to It, but from the back door the “It” becomes alive all around you. So what is the point? God is back. And it will give you great ego satisfaction that you managed something of immense importance: you have changed the name of God. It is not going to help. Your question is simply indicative of it. God has come from the back door, and is alive all around you.\nDrop the mind. That is meditation.\nIn meditation we don’t change the names of God. We don’t allow ourselves in meditation to be identified with the mind. We are the witness, and all games the mind plays are in front of the witness. The witness is separate from all games.\nYou can be a Christian; then, fed up with being a Christian, for a few years you can become a Hindu\n– “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama” – anything new gives a certain excitement. But soon Hare Krishna or Hare Rama is found in scientology – and you will not find him there long. If you go on following these people, perhaps now he is in EST. By the time you reach EST, the seeker has moved to Esalen. He will elude you, unless by some accident he ends up here. From here there is no way out.\nWe open the doors of inwardness, and the method is: just be watchful of your mind, how it fabricates philosophies, theologies, religions. Just watch. I am not telling you to do anything. In the beginning it is difficult, because you have never watched your mind. You have always thought you are the mind, you have always remained identified with the mind. So in the beginning it is going to be a little difficult, but it is not impossible. In fact, what you have done – identifying yourself with the mind – is something of the impossible. You have even managed that!\nWhat I am saying to you is simple, natural, possible. You are not the mind. And when mind stops, who is going to change the name of God? And who cares? When the mind is silent, not even a ripple of thought, that serenity, that silence will give you the first taste of godliness – not of God, because to taste God will reduce you to a cannibal.\nPlease, don’t try to eat God! But religions have been telling you to. Jesus, before departing from his company of fools, said to them, “Eat me, drink me.” Don’t do anything like that with me. I am an ordinary man, please – if you start eating me and drinking me, I will be finished soon. I will not last even one day.\nThe taste is not of God, but of godliness. That too, you simply experience and feel.\nIt is a quality, a quality that makes you aware of your immortality, that makes you aware of the infinity of existence, that makes you aware of utter beauty, grace, peace, blissfulness.\nBut there is no person like God. There is nobody, there is pure emptiness. And only pure emptiness or nothingness is what I have been calling enlightenment.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAID RECENTLY THAT WOMEN’S LIBERATION WOULD BE MEN’S LIBERATION ALSO. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MEN’S LIBERATION?\nThis is one of the fundamental laws of life, that if you make anybody a slave, in return, unknowingly, you become a slave to your slave. Slavery is a double-edged sword. You cannot simply remain the master and the other a slave. You start becoming dependent on the slave. And to make somebody a slave is to create troubles for yourself, because the slave cannot love you, cannot respect you.\nThe slave will always hate you, the slave would like to kill you. He may not be able to, but these will be the thoughts moving around him. He may be bowing down to you, but deep in his heart he wants to destroy you, because freedom is an intrinsic necessity of every human being. Nobody can like slavery. One can pretend, just to save one’s neck, but one goes on gathering fire against the master.\nJesus was crucified... one never thinks about Judas – there are so many implications in it. Why did he sell Jesus for thirty pieces of silver? Certainly he was more valuable a man – crazy, but beautiful; harmless, but with a charismatic personality. A little bit off his head, but that is not a crime. And Judas had been with him for years as a disciple. Why did he betray him?\nMy understanding is that being a disciple is a kind of slavery, and there is a limit to how long one can tolerate it. And it is not only with Jesus that it has happened; otherwise, it would be just an exception, not the rule. But it is the rule, not the exception.\nMahavira’s own son-in-law tried to kill him. He had taken initiation and become a disciple. He was hoping that because he was the son-in-law And Mahavira had only one daughter; she was also\ninitiated, they both were disciples. You can imagine, it is simple, that the son-in-law was hoping that Mahavira would declare him his successor. And when Mahavira declared that Gautam Gantha – a far more intelligent person – was going to be his successor, the son-in-law tried to kill him. And the son- in-law revolted against Mahavira, taking five hundred other disciples with him.\nNow, these five hundred disciples had also been with Mahavira for years. What was boiling within them, that rather than remaining with Mahavira they went with an idiot who had nothing to offer? And they all disappeared, evaporated, because he had nothing to offer. But they also must have been angry at the slavery that Mahavira was imposing on them.\nIn Jainism, things are really very strict. It is the most ascetic religion in the world. The Jaina monk has to remain naked in all the seasons around the year. It is difficult. The Jaina monk has to eat only one meal, begging. The Jaina monk cannot drink water in the night – even in the hot summers of Bihar where Mahavira was. As the sun sets, the Jaina monk cannot take anything in his mouth, not even water.\nThe Jaina monk, naked, with one meal a day, has to walk on hot days, on cold days, without any shoes – a naked man in shoes will look awkward. I have seen Jaina monks and nuns – their feet show the story of their asceticism: in the hot summer days they start bleeding, cracking.\nThese people who have had all these disciplines imposed on them are boiling within. They are following Mahavira because he is giving them the promise of moksha. You will be surprised that moksha is higher than what you know as paradise. So in Jainism there are three things: hell, the lowest; heaven, in the middle; and moksha, the ultimate.\nFrom heaven you are going to fall back again into life. It is a kind of spiritual holiday, a holiday place on a beautiful beach. You earn virtue – that is a bank balance of good deeds. When you have enough bank balance, you are born in heaven. But no bank balance can last forever; once your bank balance is finished you are thrown back to the earth again to be human beings.Moksha is liberation forever.\nThese poor people who had gathered around Mahavira were torturing themselves in every possible way, because this life is not long enough. So much time has passed... somebody is fifty; perhaps twenty years more, and then the eternal moksha, blissfulness forever, freedom forever.\nSo on the one hand they were doing all the austerities. But when you torture yourself, you cannot love the man really who has somehow manipulated you to torture yourself. When in the hot night you start feeling thirsty, you will curse this man – silently, of course. Even if you are sick, you cannot take medicine, because that is materialistic. You want to live in the body – that is materialistic. So if the body is falling apart, so far so good: the sooner you reach moksha.\nBut one thing is certain and simple, that these people will be gathering anger against the so-called tirthankara, Mahavira. So when his son-in-law left the fold, five hundred followed him.\nThe same is the case with Gautam Buddha. His own cousin-brother had taken initiation. The same mind, the same ego.… He was older than Buddha, he had renounced his own kingdom – he had had his own kingdom. He was hoping that he was going to be the successor. But slowly, slowly\nhe became aware that there were people like Sariputta, Mahakashyap, Moggalayan, who were very intimate with Gautam Buddha; there was not much chance for him. And he was not even worthy!\nHe left Gautam Buddha, and he also was followed by hundreds of monks. And this man tried in every way to kill Gautam Buddha. When Buddha was meditating one day under a tree in the valley by the side of a mountain, the cousin rolled a huge rock at him. The story is that the rock, seeing Buddha there, changed her route; Buddha was saved.\nI don’t think that rocks can change routes – what is more possible is that Buddha’s cousin-brother missed the target. And it is difficult to calculate If from the high top of a mountain you roll a rock,\nthe target will not be necessarily hit, because the rock will come against other rocks, trees, and will be going this way and that way until it reaches the valley. So I don’t think that the rock was very compassionate.\nBuddha’s cousin used a mad elephant who was always kept in chains because he was very dangerous, he used to kill people. He brought the elephant near Gautam Buddha when he was sitting with closed eyes, and released the elephant.\nThe story is – but it is just a story – that the elephant, who was mad, came rushing, roaring towards Buddha. But as he saw Gautam Buddha he knelt down and touched Buddha’s feet. I don’t think that elephants are wiser than man. If the cousin-brother is not changed, what possibility is there for a mad elephant to change? Perhaps it was just out of his madness that he was doing it. You can expect from mad people anything.\nThe mad elephant may have seen so many people bowing down before Buddha and touching his feet. His screws were loose, but it is a well-known fact that elephants are very imitative. That’s why they are used in circuses; they learn to imitate very easily. You will not have seen camels in the circuses, for the simple reason that camels are just idiots. Elephants are imitative. So if this mad elephant did it, it simply shows imitation. He had seen so many people every day doing it to Buddha. He was mad enough not to bother about the cousin-brother who had released him – and he was not aware of the purpose either.\nWhat I am pointing at is that the moment you claim to be higher, stronger, better in comparison to someone else, you are creating an enemy.\nMan for centuries has been repressing the woman. Calling her the weaker sex, which is absolutely wrong: man is the weaker sex. But he has deprived the woman of education, deprived the woman of any financial independence, deprived the woman of the right to move in society freely, just as he moves. The woman is carrying immense anger accumulated for centuries, and she takes revenge in her own way. She nags the husband, she screams at him, she throws pillows at him. She turns the husband into a henpecked husband.\nSlavery is always mutual. Freedom is always mutual.\nSo I don’t make any distinction between women’s liberation and men’s liberation. These are two sides of the same coin. If the woman is liberated, man’s liberation follows automatically. If man\nwants not to be nagged, not to be screamed at, not to be a target of all kinds of things that the woman throws at him And this is an everyday scene in every family.\nThe man has reduced the woman to a slave; the woman has her own ways to reduce him to a slave. If you see a couple walking on the road, you can decide without asking them whether they are married or not, whether the woman is a wife or a girlfriend. With the girlfriend the man is so happy – you can see it. With the wife he is so bored, so utterly sad, for the simple reason that this woman has made his life a hell. But who is responsible?\nFirst, you have made her a slave, now she is returning it to you in the same coins. Of course, the feminine way of taking revenge is different – her psychology is different. But no woman gives freedom to the husband. She keeps an eye on him – with whom he is talking, where he is going. She goes on looking at his coat to see if there is any woman’s hair on it. She goes on looking into his diary for phone numbers, and through phone numbers she easily can figure out with whom he is flirting.\nIt is an ugly relationship. Marriage is madness, because both are trying to overpower each other. The women can never forgive the man for what he has done to her: deprived her of education, deprived her of financial freedom, deprived her of her human dignity.\nSo if the woman has liberation, man automatically becomes liberated. There is no need for a man’s liberation movement, one movement is enough. That will help the man immensely. His joy will come back, he will be again chasing women, and that is the greatest game in the world. The poor man has to play tennis, football, volleyball, hockey – but nothing is a substitute! Chasing a woman is simply the most beautiful game.\nOnce marriage is dissolved completely and people are free to be with whomsoever they want to be – no barrier, no legality, no government, no society interfering – you will see this whole world smiling, happier, healthier, because you cannot get nourishment when you are in a state of slavery. Although you go on proclaiming to the world that you are the master of the house, you know perfectly well the moment you enter the house who is the master and who is the mistress. Certainly you are not the master.\nThis creates a strange split in you, it makes you a hypocrite. It makes you hurt, but that is an outcome of your own stupidity. Give freedom if you want freedom.\nJust one movement is enough. The woman’s liberation movement is enough, but it is not going in the right direction. It is not becoming a rebellion, it is becoming a reaction. The woman declares she is equal to man, so if the man is smoking she has to smoke; she is equal. If the man is drinking, she has to drink; she is equal. This is not rebellion, this is reaction.\nWomen are turning into lesbians. They feel so much hatred for men that millions of women don’t want to have any love relationship with men, they would prefer an unnatural and perverted relationship with a woman. And it is easier, because a man will never be able to suspect that his wife has a girlfriend. Even if the two women go on making love in the house, the husband will never suspect. But if a man comes on the scene and makes the triangle of all the stories and the films and the novels, it cannot be long before the husband discovers it.\nIt is the slavery of women that is turning the women towards lesbianism, but she thinks this is liberation from men. Dropping love for men is not liberation, you are becoming perverted.\nDrop the marriage contract, drop the license which has been issued by the court. Make your man free. Tell him, “It is up to you if you want to have any love relationships – I have no jealousy, no argument about it. But I demand the same for myself.” And if there is no slavery, no bondage between man and woman, perhaps there will be great love happening – as it happens in my commune.\nI don’t think so much love is happening anywhere else in the whole world, because nobody is jealous. People change their partners very easily. It is just a game: you get tired of playing tennis with one partner, you find another partner. And nobody is harmed, everybody is happy.\nYou will not find in my commune people who are sad, with long faces. Even Britishers in my commune are no more British. Even Proper Sagar is becoming improper!\nCHAPTER 34\nIt’s better to be red than dead\n1 August 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir\nQuestion 1:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nON THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.N., THE ONE-CENT AMERICAN POSTAL STAMP HAS THE MESSAGE, \"WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINE TO SAVE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS FROM THE SCOURGE OF WAR.\"\nCAN THE U.N. SAVE HUMANITY FROM WAR?\nThe U.N. has proved in these forty years only one thing: that it is as impotent as its predecessor, the League of Nations. The members of the U.N. are the people who are going to create the third world war. The U.N. has no power to prevent it; it is only a debating club, and not of the best kind. It is not even democratic. The big powers like America and the Soviet Union have the capacity to veto any resolution. Just one nation, America or Russia, can stop any resolution which is being passed by the whole world. Is this democratic? Every nation, small or big, poor or rich, must have equal rights! In forty years the U.N. has not been able even to do that.\nIt is just keeping people consoled: \"Don't be afraid, we are going to save you.\" In fact, from whom are they going to save us? They are the people we have to be saved from! The U.N. has not been able to stop the increasing amount of nuclear weapons. That should be the first step if you don't want the third world war. Why wait for the last moment? Why not start it now? And the basic step will be that no war preparations are made.\nWhen everybody is prepared to fight... in fact they will be forced to fight, just because each country has invested so much energy and power, and it has piled up nuclear weapons sky high: what are the nations going to do with those weapons? And they have poured such immense amounts of money into them. At what point will the U.N. stop them? And the Soviet Union can just veto it,\nAmerica can veto it.\nBut this is how politicians have been cheating humanity all along, throughout the whole history of man. They say one thing and they do just the opposite. It is very easy to publish a postal stamp that says, \"We the peoples of the United Nations are determined to save humanity from the scourge of war.\" Who are these \"we\"? Have you asked the people of the world?\nNobody wants war around the world except these idiotic politicians, because without war they have no job. War keeps politicians powerful. People have to depend on politicians because the war is coming.\nAdolf Hitler wrote in his autobiography, My Struggle... he has a few very important points to make. The first thing he says is that never in history has a great leader been born unless there is war. That's true. If there had been no second world war you would have never heard of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Winston Churchill, Roosevelt - they all became stars high in the sky. Of course, millions of people died to make them great leaders.\nThe same has been the case all along, throughout history. The politician wants to be on the top, as high as possible. If there is peace, no fight, no war, no preparation for war, he is just ordinary – perhaps a little bit less intelligent than the average person. His intelligence is not better than the average person's; it can be worse.\nBefore the Second World War the same promise was given by the League of Nations: \"We are going to save the world from war.\" But those were the same people who fought the Second World War. And I say to you, these same people who constitute the U.N. are going to create the third world war.\nThese stamps are cheap. You can go on befooling humanity, but for how long? It is time that humanity understands the politician and his cunningness. Even in the U.N. you cannot be peaceful, discussing in a friendly way. I said it is only a debating club and not the best one, because nobody is listening to anybody else. It is a tower of Babel: everybody is speaking for his government, his nation, his politics, and is not ready to listen to anything else.\nDo you know what Khrushchev did in the U.N.? He was the premier of the Soviet Union... and this kind of behavior and the people who behave in this way can they prevent the Second World War? Then who is going to start it? Do they think I am going to start the third world war; that the red people around the world are going to start the third world war?\nKhrushchev was delivering his talk to the U.N., and he became so angry that he took his shoe off and started beating on the table with the shoe! A great history of forty years; not an ordinary history. They could not prevent even Khrushchev beating their their faces with his shoe, shouting and screaming at the whole U.N.\nIn forty years they have not been able to do anything at all. This is a sheer wastage of time. The fortieth anniversary should be declared as the death of the U.N.! Finished! There is no point, they cannot agree. But the existence of U.N. gives consolation to people: \"We don't need to be worried; the U.N. is taking care of us.\" And the U.N. consists of warring nations who have nuclear weapons. They have been talking about putting a stop to it, but it is just pure talk; nobody stops.\nI think it is time that the people of the world start understanding the politician and his hypocrisy, his double personality, because if the third world war happens, then there will be no life on this beautiful planet. I don't believe at all in this declaration of the U.N., but I have another program for the people:\nFirst, don't trust your politicians. Don't be consoled by their cunning strategies.\nSecond, remember that you are going to be destroyed with your children, with your wife, with your parents, with your trees, with your animals - everything that is alive on the earth. If the people of the whole earth simply refuse and say, \"We are not going to fight, there is no point in it,\" if they refuse and say, \"We don't want boundaries of nations. If there is going to be no war, why keep these boundaries? What purpose do these boundaries serve?\" If the people of the world force their governments and say, \"Disperse all your armies. Let those people be creative \"\nMillions of people around the earth, in the army, are just doing nothing. In fact, they are hankering for war. They are not meditators who can just sit silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself. They are very ordinary people. To keep them holding their guns, watching their nuclear missiles.… How long can you keep them in this situation? Sooner or later, they will find it is better now to start - \"We are tired and bored \"\nThis is an established fact, that during the war people are less sad, more excited and happier than they are in peaceful times, because so much is going on. Every moment brings new news; excitement is natural.\nHuman history can be divided in two parts: first when there is war; second, when they are preparing for a new war. There has never been a period of real peace. Preparing for war is cold war - getting ready, because the last has taken so much, destroyed so much, that you have to prepare again. Within ten to twenty years time they are again ready, the weapons are ready and the enemies are there.\nIf really they mean what they say, then take the preliminary steps. The first is to dissolve boundaries, dissolve passports and green cards. The world, the whole earth is ours. Wherever we want to be, it is nobody's business to prevent us. Let there be freedom of movement. Let all the races, all the nations get mixed. And once the boundaries are not there, they will get mixed, they will spread all over the world - all kinds of races - and it will be a great experiment in crossbreeding. We will have better generations to come.\nIt is not enough to save the coming generations from war, if they are simply carbon copies of you. What is the point? If they are carbon copies of you, they will do the same as you have been doing. A new man is needed; a new man who feels the whole earth is his mother - not small segments of it.\nDo you see? You call your land your motherland and you have cut the mother into so many pieces - is your mother alive still? You are carrying only limbs of your mother. Somebody has taken the leg; somebody has taken the head…\nI am reminded of a religious master. He had two disciples - just as every democracy has two political parties. Those disciples were competing in every way to get more attention from the master. And the question basically was, “who is going to succeed the master?” He was getting old. So, both were trying their best to serve the master, to follow the master and to practice the discipline that he has given. But the motivation was neither the discipline nor the principles. They were not concerned with the master at all.\nOne summer day the master was sleeping, and they were not going to lose any opportunity. So they both were massaging the legs of the master. He was tired, naturally - he had come from a long journey. One was working on the left leg; the other was working on the right leg. The master was asleep.\nThe man who was working on the right leg told the other, \"Remember, if your leg comes on top of my leg, I am not going to tolerate it.\" The other said, \"And what do you think? I am going to tolerate it? I will cut off your leg if it comes on my leg!\" And they both had their swords ready.\nThe master was not really asleep, no master ever is. He opened his eyes and said, \"Boys, those\nlegs are both mine! Who told you that the right leg is owned by one and the left leg is owned by the other?\"\nBut this is the situation of the world. The mother earth has been cut into thousands of pieces. People have to be awakened to the fact, to stop calling America your motherland, stop calling Germany your fatherland. You see the difference? The whole world calls its country the motherland, except Germany! Their land is the fatherland. It is not a coincidence; they are more male chauvinistic than anybody else. Stop all this nonsense - and people can do it.\nI am preparing you to spread the fire around the world; that the whole earth belongs to us. And let the U.N. go on discussing. If they want to wrestle against each other in the U.N. building, they can have good boxing matches. It is better than throwing shoes at each other. And it will be really great entertainment, seeing your great politicians wrestling. But that will not be decisive as far as the earth is concerned.\nThe people of the earth have to take the responsibility from the hands of the politicians. And this will be a first step: to erase all the boundaries. And see how many people they can put in jails; you cannot put a whole nation in jail.\nAll the constitutions of democratic countries accept in their list of birthrights the right of movement. But where is it? You can move only within the country. They have given you a little rope to feel that you are free, but an authentic freedom of movement will mean that anybody can go anywhere on the earth. Wherever he feels to live, he can live; no hindrance should be there. Removal of the boundaries will bring one world and one world functional government.\nThe U.N. has no power over anything. I know it… In India, in 1947 after independence, Pakistan invaded Kashmir, which was part of India, and took over a large chunk of land. India fought against Pakistan. It could have been the beginning of a third world war, because the land that Pakistan had taken was very significant; it joined Pakistan with China.\nPakistan now could have a road - now they do have a road - going over the Himalayas to Peking. And China is not on speaking terms with Russia anymore. China is going to be with America, so that small piece of land is of immense significance.\nAnd what did the U.N. do? It did not force Pakistan, because America would not like that land to be lost, it is a key point in any war in Asia. So the U.N. did something futile. They said, \"First stop the war, have a cease-fire line.\" On one side Indian armies have been standing for forty years, on the other side Pakistani armies have been standing for forty years. Between the two is the camp of the\nU.N. observers to make sure that the cease-fire line is not crossed till the matter is settled.\nWho is going to settle it? And if you cannot settle such a small matter in forty years, how many centuries will you take to settle the third world war? They cannot settle the matter, because if they settle in favor of Pakistan, Russia will veto it; the settlement is finished. If they settle it in favor of India, America will veto it, and the matter is finished. So it is in limbo, and it is going to be in limbo perhaps forever, unless my people succeed in dissolving all boundaries; then that cease-fire line will also dissolve.\nAnd this is a sheer wastage! Thousands of people unnecessarily standing there with their guns ready, on alert on both sides. Just a single crackpot can start shooting, just out of boredom. Forty years...! He was young, now he is old, getting senile. Just for the sake of fun, if one man starts firing from the other side, then immediately both the armies will jump up - and nobody will care about the observers. Perhaps they will be the first ones to be killed.\nWhat has the U.N. to its credit? Nothing at all. Without any credibility, to claim that they are going to stop the third world war is simply befooling the people. They cannot stop the war between India and Pakistan, between Pakistan and Bangladesh. They cannot stop the war between Israel and the\nsurrounding Mohammedan countries, because everywhere these two great powers are involved.\nIsrael is supported by the Americans, because the American political parties cannot survive without Jews' donations to their parties. If they want donations from Jews, they have to stand by Israel. And Russia is behind the Mohammedan countries, which are bigger, surrounding the small Israel from all sides. And since the birth of Israel, the child has been in bed, almost dead. But America is keeping it alive by artificial breathing. If American steps out, Israel will be finished within a day.\nAmerica cannot step out, Russia cannot step out. In fact, it is a good opportunity; America has created it. They have a vast majority of Mohammedan countries of the whole Middle East sympathetic towards them, because in any case, these countries will need support. They are all oil countries; that's why America is hesitating, is now in a fix: if it does too much, goes a little more towards support of Israel, then all the oil countries are in the hands of Soviet Russia. And oil is now far more precious than gold.\nThe U.N. in forty years has not been able to do anything - and still these people have the nerve to say they are going to save the world from a third world war. Even in small wars they have not been able… What did the U.N. do in Vietnam? Poor people were being killed unnecessarily by Americans. It was none of America's business. Vietnam belongs to the people who live there, and if they want to be communist, who are you to prevent them? What right have you got? The same was the situation in Korea. The U.N. has failed utterly, and I am amazed that they are not even ashamed, and are declaring that they will save the coming generations from the third world war.\nOnly one thing can save the world from the coming war - which will be a total war, for the first time; all other wars were child's play. This is going to destroy the whole of life on the earth. Trees, birds, animals, man - anything living will simply be gone. I say there is one way only, and that is to spread to people more meditativeness, more love, more friendliness, more rejoicing. If we can make the earth sing songs and dance in joy, in gratitude because existence has given so much - otherwise, it would have been impossible even to purchase one sunrise. The whole wealth of the earth would not be able to purchase one sunrise.\nAnd a sunrise is a big thing - the whole wealth of the earth would not be able to produce a single rose-flower. And all this is given to man without his asking. You don't deserve it, you are not worthy of it! It is out of the compassion of existence, the overflowing joy of existence, the continuous creativity of existence that you are so rich. Millions of stars in the night…\nMake people aware of their gratitude towards life, and make people love, sing and dance. If we can spread this at-ease around the world, the third world war will be prevented. We need not bother about it. Joyous people don't want war; it is only those who are already dead who would like everybody else to be dead. They are really suffering because they are dead. They cannot laugh, they cannot enjoy, they cannot love; they cannot feel. They don't have any heart, and others have. It is making them so jealous! It will be far better that everything is finished. At least there will be no grounds for their jealousy - they will also be finished in it.\nSo I don't say that there is any direct way to prevent the third world war. That is what the pacifists of the world say: \"Protest. Have protest marches to Washington, to Moscow\" - but nobody listens to those protest marches. And I have seen those pacifists shouting and screaming against the war - I could not see any difference between them and the people who are getting ready to fight. Their screaming was enough proof that they belonged to the same category.\nIf those pacifists had weapons and missiles, they would create a war to prevent the third world war! The way they are shouting and screaming and throwing stones, simply shows that they are of the same species as the politicians against whom they are throwing stones. The difference is just that the politicians have the power, and they don't have the power.\nRemember, the husband does not scream at the wife, the wife screams at the husband. When he gets tired of her nagging and screaming, he hits the wife, he beats her. And strangely, the wife simply becomes silent. If she is not beaten, then she is going to drive the man nuts.\nIn old countries like India and China, it was told to the newly-married couple by their elders - the husband was told, \"Remember, once in a while a wife needs beating; otherwise, you will not be able to live peacefully.\" But why does the wife scream? Because the husband has the muscular strength she cannot beat the husband. There are a few exceptions, but exceptions only prove the rule. She would like to beat him, but as far as muscular strength is concerned, she cannot compete with the husband. So the moment the husband starts beating her she becomes peaceful.\nThe weak, the powerless, scream. The powerful takes his gun, puts his army on alert. The pacifists continually go on protesting. This helps nobody. Nobody listens to their protest.\nI used to know a man… My house in one city was just near the high court of the state, so all protest marches, all kinds of pacifists were passing in front of my door. And I watched them - their behavior did not seem to be peaceful. They looked uglier than the people in the high court. But I was amazed that one man was always there, whether the communist party was protesting, or the socialist party was protesting, or the people's party was protesting. And in India there are so many parties… He was always there, with every party.\nOne day I got hold of him, and I asked him, \"You are an amazing man - to what party do you belong?\" He said, \"Who cares? I am a member of all the parties.\" I said, \"But how it is possible? Communists are against the socialists, socialists are against the communists. How can you be?\"\nHe said, \"I am not concerned with their politics - I enjoy screaming! It is such a healthy thing, that whenever there is a protest I close my shop; and whoever is protesting, I am always ahead holding the flag.\" He said, \"It is really healthy.\"\nI said, \"I know. My people are doing it every morning, but they don't protest about anybody.\" I said to him, \"It is better that you start dynamic meditation, because these protests happen only once in a while, and you have to be dependent on these political parties. There is no need; you can do it on your own.\nHe said, \"On my own? Alone?\" \"No,\" I said, \"don't be worried.\" I had a meditation hall there. I said, \"Every morning many people come there.\" And he started coming. Now he is a sannyasin - I don't think for any other reason, just every day, early in the morning, it is healthy to scream. It gives you stronger lungs, a better heart, more strength. And moreover, he need not close his shop anymore; financially it is good.\nI am not a pacifist, and I don't want my people to be pacifists. That is fighting with those who are preparing for war - but you are doing the same on a small scale, in a feminine way. No, that won't help. We want to create our own movement which has nothing to do with the third world war.\nDo you see my point? If we can make humanity happier, more loving, more silent, more peaceful, we will create a real barrier against the third world war. The leaders cannot go without their people. If the people refuse, the armies refuse, if everybody refuses and says, \"I am so happy, I don't want to die. And I love humanity, so I don't want to kill. If you can manage on your own, you do it.\" A peaceful and happy man does not want to die, and does not want to kill.\nSo spread the message far and wide: It's better to be red than dead!\nQuestion 2:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT WOMEN CREATE CHILDREN, AND MEN CREATE ARTS AND OTHER MATERIAL THINGS. IS IT UNNATURAL OR NEUROTIC FOR A WOMAN NOT TO DESIRE A CHILD, AND TO PREFER TO BE AN ARTIST? I NEVER WANTED TO HAVE A CHILD. DANCE, MUSIC, POETRY, THEATER AND PAINTING WERE MY PASSION AND EXPRESSION. COULD YOU COMMENT?\nThere is nothing unnatural in it. If you don't want to have a child, you have the right not to have one. If you want to put your creativity into painting, into art, into music, it is perfectly good - far better than creating a child who is bound to be a burden on the earth. And who knows what kind of child will come out of you? Adolf Hitler can come out of you. He is waiting, searching for a womb. Joseph Stalin can come out of you. Beware! That greasy Italian, Mussolini, is waiting. All these people are standing in line, in a queue. This is not the time to give birth to a child!\nA painting is harmless. Music is beautiful, dancing will do. No, there is nothing unnatural in it. It has been said by men again and again that it is women's natural duty to give birth to children. That's how they have been able to keep the woman in slavery, because if a woman goes on giving birth to children, where is the time for her to paint? Where is the time for her to create music, poetry, drama?\nSo on the one hand they have been forcing the woman to remain continually pregnant. Just a hundred years ago, every woman around the world was continually pregnant. One child takes nine months of her life; then she has to raise the child. And when the child is not even six months old, she is again pregnant. It is like chain-smoking. And even a single child is such a nuisance…\nI agree with you. I have been asked many times, \"Wouldn't you like to have a child?\" I said, \"Me? Either I would kill the child or I would kill myself; we could not coexist! A child in my room? Impossible!\" Just to be alert, I have never married, because who knows? The woman I marry may want a child. Then trouble will arise.\nThere is no problem, unless you feel there is. Don't listen to anybody, what they say - that it is unnatural. It may be unnatural to them, so they can give birth to as many children as they want. If you feel good in painting, in writing poetry, in composing music, you are giving better children to the world - children who are harmless, who will make many rejoice. Nothing can go wrong. At the most, your poetry will not be worth anything, your music just a noise, your painting just a copy of some other painter, your literature…\nReading ten books anybody can write the eleventh book. That's how books go on increasing. There are very few books which are original. Other books are simply creations of average minds. You can see it in the films: the same story. Yes, a little bit different in details, but almost the same triangle. One woman and two men, or two women and one man - which is a little more exciting - but this triangle is the whole story of all the stories that have been written, of all the films that have been created. I sometimes wonder whether this is literature or geometry! And in geometry there are many other things, not just a triangle.\nDetails you can fit very easily, but this is not creativity. This is sheer theft, you are stealing. But that is not harm to anybody; you are just wasting your time. And if you enjoy wasting it, why should anybody prevent you? But please, don't give birth to a child. At the most he will be just an average idiot. And the world is so full of idiots that it is time that the woman refused to give idiots to the world.\nThat's why I am for bio-engineering. It is not your birthright to go on giving birth to as many children as you want, because those children are going to live on this earth, and they will do something or\nother. Only a medical board should decide about a couple. Unless you have a clearance from the medical board, you cannot produce a child. And since the pill it is so simple. Nobody is preventing you from making love; make love as much as you want, or as much as you can manage! But as far as children are concerned, you are doing something to the whole world. Making love you are not doing anything to anybody - just a little fun between two individuals; the world is not involved in it.\nChildren should be born only if a couple gets permission from the medical board. Still, that is not the best way to do it, because while he is making love a man releases millions of living beings, millions of living cells; and it is just chance in that race who will reach the female egg first. You cannot decide it, you cannot even know it. So this is not the best way. The medical board may feel that the woman is healthy, the man is healthy; they can look at your heritage - three, four generations back - and they can allow you. But this is not the best way.\nThe best way will be for intelligent people to donate their semen to the hospital, to donate the female eggs to the hospital, so the hospitals have banks - just like they have blood banks. And they can figure out which female egg and which male sperm are going to create a tremendously great, loving genius.\nYou can make a condition: \"We are donating our sperm and our eggs; if you find that some combination can create a beautiful human being, we would like to adopt. If it is not possible, then from other eggs…\" What is the problem? You can't recognize your own sperm, your sperm has no seal on it; no egg has any seal on it. The medical board can find those of some other woman, some other man, and you can adopt the child.\nIt will be healthier for the society, it will be a beautiful experience for you to raise a child who is going to be an Albert Einstein, or a Bertrand Russell, or a Jean-Paul Sartre. What a joy, that your child is not going to be pope the Polack! That your daughter is not going to be Mother Teresa! It is sheer joy. And knowing what your child is going to be… because the medical, the biological study of the sperm and the egg can give you all the predictions: how long he will live, what kind of man he will be\n- or woman; how he should be brought up so that his potential flowers and he is not distracted from his potential. It will be really a work of art, far more precious than any painting, because you will be giving to the world a treasure.\nSo I am all for bio-engineering. And this stupid way of producing children has done enough harm. The whole history is full of it. Don't you ever think that if a gardener plants thousands of trees, and only once in a while one tree flowers - would you call that gardener a gardener? Thousands of children are born, and rarely will someone become a Mozart or a Gautam Buddha. Most of them will be clerks, postmasters, stationmasters. Your son being a clerk, even if he becomes the head clerk, is not going to bring you the rejoicing that I would like. And these jobs soon will be transferred to the machines, to the computers. The clerks are going to be out of employment very soon.\nDon't produce clerks! Don't produce station-masters, postmasters. We have had enough. Now machines can take the place of all ordinary jobs. But the machine cannot become a Bertrand Russell, a Wittgenstein or a Martin Heidegger; that is beyond the computer.\nYou have to create a child which will be needed, and cannot be replaced by any machine, otherwise, everybody is going to be unemployed, hungry, starving. It will not be only in Ethiopia, it will be all over the world. And the machine is more reliable than your beloved son who has become the clerk.\nJust now I got the information that they have made a computer especially for Mohammedans, be- cause the Mohammedan has to pray facing towards Mecca, his holy land. But it is really a difficult job to be absolutely accurate. Most probably you are wrong; there is only a small chance that you are exactly facing towards Mecca. A computer has come onto the market: you just put the machine\non, move the machine, and when it starts giving an alarm that means this is the place; you are absolutely accurate.\nPerhaps my sannyasins will also need it. Where you face while you are doing your gachchhamis is just approximate. A computer can make it a hundred percent certain. The same computer that Mohammedans are using, with a little change, will be able to do your work too. Then around the earth, wherever you are, you can do the gachchhamis directed towards me!\nPlease give birth to a child who cannot be replaced by machines, by computers. And that is possible only if you drop that old jealous idea that the semen has to be yours; that the egg has to be your wife's. I don't see what is so special about your semen and your wife's egg. Why bother about it? And you have practiced that thing for thousands of years - just look at the world, what you have done! Such a mediocre lot. And if this mediocre lot is there, it is very difficult to get rid of politicians.\nIf you can give birth to children that have the highest possibility of intelligence, I don't think they will vote for any chimpanzee to be the president of America. In fact, all political parties will disappear, because every individual will have enough intelligence to decide on his own. He does not need any political propaganda; he does not need to be persuaded. It is an insult.\nI have never voted in my life, for anything, but when there were elections politicians would come, not knowing. And then they would get into trouble, because I would ask them questions.\nThey said, \"We have not come here to take an examination.\"\nI said, \"But first, I have to examine your mind. How can I vote for an idiot? You have to prove that you have some genius in you.\"\nThey said, \"This is strange. Nobody asks whether you have genius in you or not.\"\nI said, \"Unless you prove that you have genius in you, I cannot give my support to you to be in power. You can be dangerous to humanity.\" I would criticize their political line, their ideology, and say, \"You have to defend it.\" They wanted to escape; they wanted to find some excuse. I would say, \"This is not going to do. And remember, if you fail with me, I am going to tell all the neighbors and all the professors around that this is not the man to vote for.\"\nI have seen tears in their eyes: why in the first place did they get caught with this man? Slowly it be- came known, and for years no politician has approached me in election time to vote. I have been waiting for them, I enjoyed the game.\nNo, these mediocre people are not needed. They are accidental. The children that you think are yours are only accidents. Because you are not giving birth consciously, you are groping in the dark; you don't know what the result is going to be. With bio-engineering, for the first time you can have guidelines for the child's whole future. You can even tell the medical board what kind of child you would like, how long he should live, that you would not like him to have AIDS, that you don't want him to be a homosexual, that you don't want him to be a Catholic or a communist. You want him to be simply human and absolutely free from all ideology. You would like him to have the sharpest intelligence that has ever happened on the earth. You would like something better than Socrates.\nAnd this is possible. When you can have Socrates as your child, then why go for Tom, Dick and Harry? Just leave my Harry out of it!\nQuestion 3:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSANNYASINS WHO ARE DYING IN YOUR PRESENCE DISCOVER THEIR ENLIGHTENMENT. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE STILL ALIVE? IS IT THAT LIFE\nCOMES SO CLOSE TO DEATH, AND WE ARE AFRAID OF DYING YET STILL NOT CAPABLE OF BEING ALIVE IN THIS PRECIOUS MOMENT?\nIt is an important question. It may have arisen in many people's mind: \"Why, when a person dies, is it easy to become enlightened? The same person when he was alive was not capable of becoming enlightened.\" The reason is very simple. When you are alive you cannot drop your ego, you cannot drop your jealousy. You cannot drop your hatred, anger, greed, because you think these are all that life consists of. If you drop all these, what is there to live for? You cannot drop your ambition; otherwise your life will be simply meaningless. That is your reasoning. And enlightenment requires as a basic condition that all this luggage should be thrown. You should stand absolutely in purity, without any luggage, without even any clothes, just naked.\nThose who can gather that much courage, can become enlightened any moment. But when a sannyasin is dying it is easy for him. Now he knows that he is dying: what use is ambition? What use is hatred? What use is jealousy? What use is greed? What use is the ego?\nDeath standing in front of his eyes makes it clear that now he can drop all that unnecessary luggage: anyway, death is going to take all that away. It happens in a single moment - the whole idea, the revelation that now there is nothing to be lost - so why not try? \"Osho has been saying, ’Drop this, drop that.' I could not do it while I was alive, but now there is no problem. Take a chance – see whether he was right or wrong.\"\nAnd this is not a long process of thinking. It is a simple experience in a single moment before death. And the person simply slips out of the old, rotten bag in which he has been living; now he can feel the stink and everything. Death immediately becomes enlightenment.\nThen death is no longer ordinary death, then death is a door to the divine. You can do it while you are living, there is no problem. In fact, to do it when you are dying is not of much use: you never got to enjoy it. While you are alive, if you can do what I say, you will have time to enjoy enlightenment.\nAnd enlightenment is not something that is given to you, handed over to you. Enlightenment is a growing process in you. The man who becomes enlightened at the moment of death has missed much. He has missed all the joys of life, which are available only to the enlightened consciousness. He had loved, but that love was simply phony, American. If he had had the chance to love after enlightenment, he would have known the tremendous beauty of it, the ecstasy of it. He has been eating tasteful, delicious food all his life, but he was asleep, he had no sensitivity. He was never in the moment; while he was eating, he was somewhere else faraway - perhaps on the moon.\nThe enlightened man is always in the moment; hence, every experience becomes intense, enjoyed to the fullest.\nIt is better to die enlightened than to die unenlightened. At least there is one thing left for you to experience as an enlightened man: that is death. But much more you have missed. So I will not suggest to you to wait for death. Certainly those who are with me are going to become enlightened at the moment of death, but why wait for it when you are young and alive and full of juice? Becoming enlightened at the time of death, you are just a dry bone, there is no juice left; otherwise why should you die? When you are full of juice, full of life, with all the dimensions available, become enlightened.\nAnd the process is so simple that even a dying man can manage it. It is really a shame that you are alive and you cannot manage it. Perhaps you only think you are alive. Perhaps you only dream you are alive, and death is such a shock that you wake up. But I am here to give you any kind of shock you need. I am giving you them already without asking your permission, because the moment you become a sannyasin I take it for granted that now I do not need any permission to give this man a shock - any kind of shock.\nDrop all that nonsense which is holding you back from experiencing life in its totality. Drop all that which is keeping you in a narcotic sleep. And what I am asking you to drop is worthless, perhaps worse than worthless. It is poison that you are not dropping, that you are holding on to: Jealousy is poison, hate is poison; greed is poison. The ego is perhaps the most dangerous poison.\nJust the other night I was talking to a woman journalist. She had come directly from Billy Graham - she had been covering Billy Graham for three weeks, and of course she asked about him. And I said, \"He is a worthless man. None of my sannyasins will be impressed with that idiot, and none of his audience is going to understand me. His audience consists of retarded people. His face itself looks retarded. Whenever I see his photograph I simply close my eyes. He looks like a chimpanzee, well shaved.\"\nI told her, \"My work and his work are totally opposite, diametrically opposite. He is giving consolation to people so they can sleep better. He is telling them, `Have faith in Jesus Christ, he is the savior. He can do anything; he is the only begotten son of God. If things are not happening to you, if miracles are not happening to you, that only shows your faith is not enough. Have more faith and your life will be filled with miracles.\"\nThis is consoling people, helping them to go into deeper sleep. My work is totally different. If you are asleep and snoring perfectly, I will do everything that can be done so that you have to jump out of bed. I know you will try every possible way… I will tickle your nose, and you will throw my hand away. I will tickle your feet, and you will pull them in. I may tickle with a hair in your ear, and you will turn to the other side. To protect yourself you will pull the blanket over yourself. But nothing is going to help, no blanket can save you.\nAnd sooner or later you are going to get tired of all these things that I am doing to you. You will have to open your eyes and see what is happening.

SANNYAS?</p><p>I think you do not understand the meaning of discipleship. You are
asking something impossible. It is almost as if I ask you: Can you be my
sannyasin if I don’t want to be your master? You can see the absurdity
of it. But why such a question arises in the first place has to be
understood. It has to do with the whole past of humanity.</p><p>People are Christians without being Christians; people are Hindus
without being Hindus. Only formally do Christians accept Jesus as their
master. It is not an intimate, sincere, total relationship. It is just
by birth – it is an accidental relationship. They have not chosen to be
Christians. They are born in a Christian home, or in a Jewish home, and
they have been conditioned to believe that Jesus is your master, Moses
is your master – poor Moses knows nothing about you, neither has Jesus
any idea who you are. And this is true all over the world.</p><p>Religion has nothing to do with your birth. By birth one cannot be
Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan; but that’s how it has been happening.
Religion has been joined with birth to deceive you. The best way to
deceive a person is to give him the idea that what people are seeking,
he has already got. This is the most refined way of cheating.</p><p>A Christian never thinks of searching to find out what religion is,
what it means to be a disciple, what it means to accept someone as your
master. He has been deceived from birth to believe that he</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p><br></p><p>already has religion. Ready-made it has been given to him. No effort
on his part has been made, no search, no seeking, no enquiry. He has a
master in Jesus Christ, he has a holy book in THE BIBLE; everything is
supplied by tradition, family, society.</p><p>They don’t leave any chance for you to enquire on your own; and the
problem is, unless you enquire on your own you will never find what life
is all about, what truth is, what these tremendous moments are, like
when one becomes a disciple, when one finds a master.… You will never
know those moments of ultimate rejoicing. You will never run in the
street naked, shouting, “Eureka! I have found it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Archimedes was not mad. He was one of the most important scientists
of his time and of all times. And if he, finding a simple thing, a
scientific fact, forgets all about clothing because he was in his
bathtub when he found a certain principle for which he had been
looking.…</p><p>When you are looking continuously in all directions, knocking on all
doors, you never know which door is the right door. Archimedes was
puzzled for months because the king had told him, “If you are really a
scientist you should find out one thing. Somebody, another king, has
presented me with a crown of gold. I want to know whether it is pure
gold, or if there is some mixture in it. Is any other metal mixed in
with it? And I don’t want the crown to be cut. I don’t want you even to
touch it. You have to find the answer without spoiling the beautiful
present.”</p><p><br></p><p>For months Archimedes was troubled: how to find out? If he were
allowed to cut a little piece of the crown it would have been possible
to find out whether other metals were mixed in or not. When a question
remains continuously with you for twenty-four hours, it takes you, by
and by, close to the answer. The answer comes in a moment of relaxation.
The question is a tension, but you can get the answer in relaxation only
if the tension has been to its uttermost climax.</p><p>It had been so for months, and the king was asking every day.
Archimedes was starting to feel embarrassed: a well known scientist
cannot find such a small thing? People had started laughing at him. He
could not sleep, he could not do anything – only one question.… That
day, relaxing in his bathtub – which was full of water, completely full
– as he sat in the tub, naturally some water flowed out to make a space
for him. And something clicked in his mind. He weighed the water that
had flowed out, and he found the principle. If pure gold is put in
water, then a certain amount of water will come out. If some other metal
is mixed in it, then a different amount of water will come out, because
that certain metal will not have the same effect on water as the gold if
it is pure.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the crown need not be destroyed; it has just to be put in water,
and another piece of pure gold of the same volume can be put in water
and you can see how much water comes out from both. If it is exactly the
same then the crown is of pure gold; if it is not, then there is a
mixture. The finding was not something great. He had not found a master,
or truth; he had not realized himself. He had not entered into nirvana.
But such a small finding The question is not of small or great; the
question is</p><p>of finding yourself. The joy comes from finding, not what you
find.</p><p>Archimedes jumped out of his bathtub, ran out of his bathroom, and
rushed into the street shouting, “Eureka!” A crowd followed him. They
thought, “We were always thinking this man is crazy, now he has gone
completely crazy; naked, he is going towards the palace!”</p><p><br></p><p>He reached the court naked, shouting “Eureka, I have found it!”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “It seems you must have found it. But where are your
clothes?” That moment</p><p>Archimedes became aware that he was naked.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “Your coming naked shows that you must have found it,
because when someone finds something it is such a joy. Who cares about
clothes? Who remembers about manners? You need not say anything to me;
just your coming in this way has given me proof that you must have found
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But you have not found Christianity. You have never shouted,
“Eureka!” You have not found Hinduism; you have not found anything that
could have driven you into the street naked, shouting. This is why such
a question arises.</p><p>You have been living on borrowed things. You can borrow things but
you cannot borrow experiences. You can borrow money from someone, but
you cannot borrow his love experience. You cannot say, “Just give me
your love experience for two days, and I will return it with interest.”
Love experience is not a commodity.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me, “Can you still be my master if I don’t wish to be
a sannyasin?” There must be many misconceptions in your mind. As if it
is something that the master has to do! So if the master accepts, that’s
enough, you need not be a disciple, you need not be a sannyasin, you
need not do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>That too is given by your idiotic tradition to you: Jesus is the
savior, all that you need is to accept him as your savior, and that’s
all. The whole responsibility is his. On your part only one thing is
needed: to accept him as your savior. Nothing else is needed, no
transformation in you.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality is just the opposite: the master does nothing. It is in
your becoming a disciple that the whole mystery lies. It is in your
surrender of the ego that the whole search comes to an authentic point.
It is in putting your mind aside.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what sannyas is: an authentic discipleship. It means putting
your mind aside. You have lived according to your mind up to now. If
that is fulfilling, then there is no need for anybody to become a
sannyasin.</p><p>If you feel you are blissful with your mind, then why bother about a
master? Why carry an unnecessary load? Why become tethered? It is
certain that as your mind is, it is nothing but anguish; it is
suffering, misery, despair. But you are not ready to become a sannyasin.
That means you are not ready to put your mind aside.</p><p><br></p><p>Translated into reality, you are not wishing to change even a little
bit – not even your clothes, what to say about your mind? You are not
ready even to hang a mala with my picture around your neck, how are you
going to allow me to enter into your heart?</p><p><br></p><p>You want me to be your master and you are keeping yourself closed in
every possible way. You are saying, “Would you like to come into my
house?” and you are closing the doors in my face. On the one hand you
are inviting me, on the other hand you are closing your doors and
windows, so I cannot enter in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>The relationship between a master and a disciple is one of the
greatest mysteries of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>The master does nothing – remember it always. He is only a presence.
All that is done is done by the disciple. The presence of the master is
helpful, just the presence. It is immensely nourishing. His presence
gives you the guarantee that what has happened to him can happen to you;
otherwise where are you going to find the evidence that things like that
happen? The master’s only function is to give you tangible evidence.</p><p>You cannot make Jesus your master because he has been dead for two
thousand years. The relationship between a master and a disciple is a
living relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t get married to women who died two thousand years ago;
otherwise, I think everybody would be marrying Cleopatra, Amrapali. Who
will bother about ordinary women when you can marry Cleopatra? And
Cleopatra cannot say no; she has been dead for a long time. But you are
doing the same thing when you relate yourself to Jesus, Buddha,
Mohammed.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t understand a simple thing, that relating to a master is a
bigger, far bigger love relationship; it is a far more crazy love
affair. It cannot happen between somebody who is living and somebody who
has been dead for thousands of years; the distance is too much. But
people prefer to make Jesus, Mohammed, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, their
master, for the simple reason that the master is not present, he cannot
say no. He cannot tell you, “First you have to go through a
transformation.” It is a one-way affair; the other party is absent.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not absent, I am present. You cannot ask such a stupid
question to me.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t wish to become a sannyasin – am I mad, that I should
become a master to you? Why should I become a master to you? For what?
You are not even wishing to be a sannyasin. You don’t want to give
anything, and you want to get everything. Becoming your master I will be
taking on your total responsibility. And you are not even wishing to be
a sannyasin – which is nothing. At least my sannyas is the simplest that
has ever existed on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>What is required of you? Even this seems to be too much. Then just
don’t be bothered with the greater things of life. Go back to your hell.
You are not meant to have eyes; perhaps to remain blind is your destiny.
Remain blind.</p><p>Asking such a question implies that a master is to do everything, the
only thing needed is to be accepted by him, then your work is finished.
Now you can go on doing all the nonsense that you have been doing. You
can do it now even more without any guilt, without any fear, without any
worry about the consequences, because now somebody has taken your
responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Omar Khayyam, one of the great poets of Persia, said, “Don’t stop me
from enjoying women and wine. Don’t stop me – because God is forgiving;
if I do not commit sin, then what will happen to God’s forgiveness? I
have to commit sins just to keep God qualified, compassionate,
forgiving. No sin is bigger than God’s compassion. Let me commit the
worst: he is there.”</p><p><br></p><p>You see the logic of the man? It is perfectly clear. If God’s very
quality is to forgive, then what is the fear of sin? And how much sin
can you commit? God’s compassion is infinite. All your sins combined
will still be finite, they cannot be infinite. If you can commit
infinite sins you have become almost a God because you can do infinite
things. Then there is no difference between you and God. You have
infinity in your hands as much as God has.</p><p><br></p><p>Omar Khayyam’s statement is significant because that’s what all
religious people are doing: they put the responsibility on somebody, and
then they go on doing their thing, hoping, believing that everything
will be all right in the end. They have a great savior who will stand
for them before God.</p><p>Your question seems to be just throwing responsibility on me. And I
am a very irresponsible person. I have never lived responsibly. From my
very childhood everybody has been telling me, “Be responsible.” But I
have always said, “I enjoy being irresponsible so much that I don’t see
the point, why I should be responsible. You enjoy being responsible – be
responsible. I never say to you, ‘Be irresponsible.’ Why do you bother
about me? If my irresponsibilities are going to lead me to hell I am
perfectly willing to go there, because anyway I don’t want to live with
your saints.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have lived with saints and I have lived with sinners, and I have
seen that to be with sinners is far more colorful, far more pleasant,
far more human. There is some song in it, some dance in it; there is
laughter, there is life. To live with a saint is to live with a dead
man, a corpse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever been in a room alone with a corpse? Can you sleep? Can
you eat? Can you drink? Can you laugh? The corpse will not interfere in
any way, but just the presence of the corpse in the room is enough to
prevent you from living. Do you see the great principles involved there?
The corpse is not doing anything, and yet you cannot eat – you will feel
like throwing up. You cannot sing. The corpse is not preventing you, the
corpse is not going to hear it, but just the idea of singing when the
corpse is there.…</p><p><br></p><p>Saints are dead people. The more dead they are, the more they are
thought to be saintly. To live with them is simply sickening. It is
nauseating. They are so inhuman about everything. They themselves live
mechanically, robot-like, and they won’t allow anybody else to live
differently. They will make you feel guilty for everything.</p><p>In Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram – and he was a great saint, mahatma means
great saint – you could not smoke. I know smoking is silly, but what is
wrong in being silly? And if one enjoys it, once in a while to be silly
is perfectly human. It should be acceptable. You can tell the person,
“It will harm your health, your life will be reduced by five years.” But
if you don’t want to live that long, it is perfectly good – because what
are you going to do with five years more? You will smoke more!</p><p>And it is not a healthy habit; but people who don’t smoke, they fall
sick – and I have seen people who have been smoking continuously,
chain-smokers, never falling sick. So all this is just guesswork. All
that the smoker is doing is enjoying taking the smoke in and throwing it
out. The smoke is warm, just like the mother’s milk, and the cigarette
is exactly the mother’s nipple; he is again enjoying being a child.</p><p><br></p><p>A cigarette is just a way of enjoying one’s childhood again; that’s
why a cigarette is so relaxing. When you are worried, tense, you start
looking for a cigarette. It helps; it is human. It will look really odd
to go to your mother now, and say, ” I am so tense and worried<span class=s6></span>” I think cigarettes are a good</p><p>substitute. Don’t disturb these people; otherwise they will disturb
women. Your mother may be dead – then you have to go to your wife, and
she may be just mad at the idea that you have come with. She will think
you are going nuts.</p><p><br></p><p>Cigarettes are such a simple substitute; don’t disturb people. When I
see you smoking I feel sorry for</p><p>you, not because you are smoking but because you have to smoke. I
think about your worries, not</p><p><br></p><p>about your smoking; that is nothing to be bothered about. I think
about your anguish, your tension. I think that there must be something
eating at your heart; otherwise why should you burn yourself with
smoking? I never judge your smoking, that you are doing some wrong act.
I see deeper. I see why you are smoking.</p><p>But no saint bothers about why you are smoking. For them smoking is a
sin. In Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram if somebody was found to be smoking he
was immediately turned out in disgrace; he had fallen. And the poor
fellow was simply trying to relax. In fact his smoking was an indication
that the ashram was not relaxing, that it was not a place where people
could relax. Instead, it was a place where people became more tense. In
fact, all the ashrams make you more tense.</p><p>It is a strange dilemma: they make you more tense, more worried. This
world is not enough for them; they bring in hell and heaven and all
kinds of consequences that you will have to suffer. Rather than helping
you to get out of your tense mind, they make your mind more tense – and
then you cannot smoke, then you cannot drink even tea or coffee; these
are all prohibited because they are all relaxing.</p><p><br></p><p>A relaxed person may not need to smoke unless playfully, once in a
while, sitting with friends, when everybody is smoking and he does not
want to play the saint. I used to go to parties when I was in the
university. It was a problem because the host was worried that everybody
would be drinking and I might feel left out. Knowing it from many other
previous experiences, I had to go to the host and say, “Don’t be worried
about me. You just give me Coca Cola as if I am also drinking with
everybody.”</p><p>But he would say, “They will think you are also drinking
alcohol.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Let them think that, it is no problem. What is the problem?
It simply shows I am also human. I want to participate with them, I
don’t want to be holier-than-thou. To me that attitude is ugly, that
attitude is simply egoistic.</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot drink alcohol, because I don’t know what I will do after
drinking. There is no problem – as far as I am concerned there is no
problem, I can drink, because I don’t think that even though alcohol is
called spirits, it can be spiritual, or it can enter into my spirit. It
will just go through my kidneys and sooner or later pass out of the
body. So there is not much of a problem. I am thinking of you, because I
may do something, and that may create trouble for you! So just give me
Coca Cola.”</p><p>Drinking Coca Cola with people – they almost all glared at me! They
all said, “You are also drinking?</p><p>We were worried that you would be here not drinking, and we would
look like sinners.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “No, I am a drunkard. You go on, you cannot compete with me”
– because I could go on drinking Coca Cola as much as I wanted. But I
felt happy that they were not feeling guilty. I felt that I had done
something appropriate; I had been human.</p><p><br></p><p>Your saints are not human. Gandhi was very particular about
cleanliness. He followed the same idea: cleanliness is next to God. Now
for me it is a trouble – there is no God, so only cleanliness remains.
Not even next to God, just the first – there is no next. But I don’t
come to look into your room, and into your bathroom. That seems to me
evil. But Gandhi used to do that.</p><p><br></p><p>He would go into your room to see that everything is as it should be.
He would have a look in your bathroom to see whether it was clean or
not. But this is interfering in your privacy. I can talk about
cleanliness, I can praise cleanliness. I can tell you the beauty of it;
but then at least I should trust you, your intelligence, your privacy,
and ultimately your responsibility to yourself. I am not responsible for
you.</p><p>But this is not the way of the saints up to now. They have been after
their disciples almost like detectives, making the disciple feel as
guilty as possible. There is some arithmetic behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>The more guilty they make people feel, the bigger saints they are
thought to be. Their height goes on becoming higher and higher as you go
on sinking lower and lower. Their whole saintliness depends on your
guiltiness. And to make you feel guilty is very simple: start condemning
everything that is human, that is natural.</p><p><br></p><p>On my path the master is only a light. You can see in that light and
go wherever you want to go. The master is not somebody who is
continuously following you, forcing you. He is simply a presence. In his
presence you become aware of your ultimate potential. You become aware
of what you can be, and what you are not. You become aware of your
hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is nothing but dropping your hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say to me, “I don’t wish to be a sannyasin.” You insist on
remaining a hypocrite, a split person. Making me your master, you will
be more split. You will become more guilty because you have made
somebody a master and you are not a disciple to him.</p><p><br></p><p>It will look unkind to you that I refuse. But it is a refusal out of
compassion, not out of unkindness. I refuse to be a master of anyone who
is not wishing to be a disciple.</p><p>The meaning of the word ‘disciple’ is beautiful. It means one who is
ready to learn. And there is much to be learned. Almost everything has
to be learned, because whatsoever you know is not learning, it is
knowledge, completely rotten knowledge. You have taken it from others;
you have not searched for it, looked for it, enquired about it. It is
not your own, you cannot say “Eureka!” Not for a single thing can you
say “Eureka!” And a man who is ready to learn, a disciple, finds every
moment like Archimedes – life goes on revealing new secrets every
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>How can I become a master to you? You are not ready to be vulnerable
to me. You are not ready to be open to me, you are not ready to listen
to me, you are not ready to come along with me. You want to remain as
you are, what you are, yet you want one more guarantee: you want me to
become responsible so that you feel less guilty – at least you have a
master. But that is not going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have all the masters of the world – and that’s the beauty of
dead masters, they cannot say no. You can accept all the masters of the
world, be a disciple of all the masters of the world. There are people
who are following Zen, who are following Sufism, who are following Tao,
anything. Neither Lao Tzu can prevent them, nor Bodhidharma can prevent
them, nor Jalaluddin Rumi can prevent them. Those people are gone, just
words echoing are left.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am yet in the flesh.</p><p><br></p><p>I am yet not only a word.</p><p><br></p><p>My word is still living.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to have any contact with me, you will have to be ready to
travel with me. It is a long journey. Much of the load that you are
carrying will have to be dropped. Much of the mind which you are
thinking is very valuable will prove just junk. Much of your character
that you valued so much will prove nothing but forced discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>Discipline can be forced so much that it becomes unconscious. People
are behaving in the right manner – are not stealing, are not harming
others, not hurting others – but it is not their conscious choice.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a retired military general... it was a case after
the first world war. The general had lived his whole life in the army –
and not only his life; his father was a general, his father’s father was
a general. As far back as he could remember their family had been in the
army. It was in his blood. From the very beginning he was disciplined in
the manners of the army.</p><p>He was retired now, the war was over. One day he was carrying a
bucket full of eggs, and a man just played a joke on him; the man
shouted, “Attention!” and the general stood to attention, dropping the
bucket and all the eggs on the road. He was very angry; his eggs were
all finished. And he said, “What kind of a joke is this?”</p><p>The man said, “But can’t I say ‘Attention!’? It has nothing to do
with you. You could have carried your bucket. I was not telling you to
drop it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The general said, “You don’t understand, it has gone into my blood,
into my bones. Even in the night, if somebody says, ‘Attention!’ I will
jump out of the bed and be at attention. Only then will I realize that
it is a joke – but first I will be in position.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is discipline. Your morality, your character, are nothing but
forced disciplines. They have become unconscious, and anything that is
unconscious is of no value at all. Coming along with me you will have to
understand that your morality is just imposed. You are an impostor
pretending to be moral, not knowing even the ABC of morality. Your
character is nothing.</p><p>When I applied for a professorship, they asked me for a character
certificate. I said, “I cannot produce one.”</p><p>The education minister said, “But why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “For the simple reason that I haven’t found a man of
character from whom I would like to have a character certificate.”</p><p>He said, “You are something. You can’t find a man of character?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “No, I can’t find a man of character. And how can I have a
character certificate from somebody</p><p>to whom I cannot give a character certificate?”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew my vice-chancellor and I told him, “I cannot take a character
certificate from you because I</p><p>cannot give a character certificate to you. I know you perfectly
well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew my head of department, who was a very loving man, who loved
me. But he himself said, “I cannot give you a character certificate
because I don’t have any character and you know it perfectly wel l.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to the education minister, “You give me a character
certificate, and I will expose you – I will just call a press conference
today. You give me a character certificate and I will tell the press
conference what kind of character you have.”</p><p>He started perspiring. He said, “You just take your appointment
later.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I said, “What about the character certificate? – because it has
to be attached to the application.” He said, “Don’t be worried.”</p><p>I said, “No, it is a question of principle. If everybody needs a
character certificate then I will write a character certificate for
myself. That’s the only man I know perfectly well who has character.
About anybody else it is at the most guesswork.”</p><p>He said, “Do whatsoever you want, just please leave me alone. You
take your order.” So I wrote a character certificate for myself. He
said, “But please don’t sign it in your own name because I will be in
trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I said, “Whose name have I to sign?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Anybody’s name but not your own name.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I signed it in the name of one of my professors. He said, “But you
are signing with somebody else’s name. I know this man, S.S. Roy; he is
your professor. What are you going to tell him?”</p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried. This a copy of the original, the
original I will take from him.” I said, “This is done everyday; the
original is taken, then copies are made. This is just the reverse: the
copy is given to you, the original I will make.”</p><p>I went to S.S. Roy. I told him that this had happened and, “This is
the character certificate I have</p><p>written. You give me the original.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the certificate. He said, “You should have come to me,
because you have not written anything good. I would have given you a
beautiful character certificate.”</p><p>I said, “It was something spontaneous. That man was in a difficulty
and I could not write more than</p><p>this about myself. What more can I write?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But this is not a character certificate at all, because you
are saying that you are a human</p><p>being – this is very ordinary. You ask me to sign it, and it says
that you have all the weaknesses of</p><p><br></p><p>human beings, that one cannot trust you, you are not reliable. Now I
have to sign it,” he said, “and you will show it to people.”</p><p>I said, “No, I will not show it. The original I will give to you. The
original you can keep in case it is</p><p>needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Then it is okay because I don’t want people to see that I
have written this character certificate about you. I love you and I know
you. These are not your qualities.”</p><p>I said, “But when I have to write about myself, do you think I should
write, ‘He is the only begotten son of God’? Do you want me to be
crucified? Once was enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>Coming along with me you will have to drop almost the whole of you.
Only the essential will remain, only that which you cannot drop. Even if
you want to drop it you cannot. Only that will remain.</p><p>It is a great surgery in which all the cancerous growth that
surrounds you has to be cut out completely. It is painful, it is hard.
Just because it is so painful and so hard, I make it as light as
possible, as joyous as possible. I try to make it a joke for the simple
reason that the task is hard, and it is good to pass the dark night of
the soul with laughter, with gossiping, with joking, with dancing, with
singing. It is good to pass the dark night of the soul with joy.</p><p>What is the point of crying and weeping and mourning and wearing the
black habits of the Christian priests? The night is dark enough, why
make it darker? To transform yourself, to change, is painful enough; why
make it more miserable?</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was operated on, a little operation. I continued to joke with
the doctor. He said, “You please wait. Don’t make me laugh because I may
do something wrong. Leave me alone. I was saying from the very beginning
that you need chloroform; otherwise you will go on talking and you will
disturb me. But you said local anesthesia will do. So we have given” –
he was doing the operation on my finger – “so we have given you local
anesthesia. But it was wrong – you don’t leave us alone, you just go on
joking!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Lying down on a surgical table, is it not the right place to
joke? And will it not be helpful to you to be laughing and enjoying and
doing your work? Just the way a painter paints, a surgeon should do his
work. Why make it sad and It is already painful; make it light, don’t
make it heavier.”</p><p>Hence, my sannyas is a rejoicing. You say you are not wishing to
rejoice with me. You say you are not going to laugh with me. You say you
are not going to dance with me, sing with me. Then for what are you
wanting me to be your master? To make you more sad? Are you not sad
enough? To make you more guilty? Have not the Christian priests done
enough? Do you want me to make a heavier cross? Is not Jesus’ cross
weighty enough for you? For what do you want me to be your master?</p><p><br></p><p>And to be your master or not, that has to be left to me; you are not
to be concerned about it. Your whole concern should be, can you be a
disciple? “How can I be a disciple?” should be your question. You are
not going to be a master so why bother about the master? That is my
business. And I know my business perfectly well. You just leave it to me
– you do your part. And if you succeed in doing your part you will not
go empty-handed from my door. But first things first. You should be
ready to do your part.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming a sannyasin is not just changing the robe and changing the
name; those are just playful things. I could have chosen any color. Blue
is good, the color of the ocean. Green is good, the color of the whole
of nature. I could have chosen any color.</p><p>I have chosen red for two reasons. One, because red in the East has
been the color of sannyasins for centuries. I have not chosen it because
it has been the color of the sannyasins, so that my sannyasins should
also be part of that tradition. No, I have chosen it to sabotage that
tradition, because all those sannyasins were serious people: heavy,
dull, mediocre.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to bring a new breeze into the world of sannyas, and to
disturb the definition of the sannyasin, which had become completely
ossified. I created confusion. Now in India it is very difficult to know
who is who. My sannyasins are laughing, enjoying, dancing, and the
people cannot understand what is the matter because sannyasins have
never done such things.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, I chose red because red has become associated with
communism. I wanted to sabotage that idea too, that red is anybody’s
monopoly. Just to disturb these two I chose red. But this is just
playful.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to think about sannyas in its deepest meanings. It
means that you have found someone whose eyes can see farther than your
eyes can see, whose reach of the hand goes higher than the reach of your
hand. You have found someone that you feel jealous of. You would like to
have this serenity, this peace, this silence, this song. Then be
prepared on your part.</p><p>I am ready, I have been long ready.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t miss the opportunity, because I will not be here forever.
Today I am here, tomorrow I may not be here. So if you want in some way
to use my insight, my vision, my experience, if you want to become a
part of my universe, then don’t miss a single moment, because nothing
can be said about the next moment. I may not be here, and then your
getting ready will be pointless. Now I am here, and you are not
ready.</p><p>That has been happening again and again in the past. It is said the
day Gautam Buddha died a man came running. Buddha had told his
disciples, “This is my last meeting with you in the body. I am going to
leave the body. Before I leave, if you have any more questions left” –
he had been answering for forty-two years – “if anything is still left
in anybody’s mind, ask it, because I won’t be here anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples were crying, weeping. What can you ask? For forty-two
years Buddha had been answering even those questions which you had not
asked. He had been answering questions which you had wrongly asked. But
he had answered rightly. He was not only answering you, he was also
creating questions for you. In forty-two years he had done everything
that was possible. Now, what to ask at the last moment?</p><p>They said, “No, we are just grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha closed his eyes, he moved the first step inwards – that is, he
moved away from the body to the mind. The second step: he moved from the
mind to the heart. The third step he was just going</p><p><br></p><p>to take, from the heart to the feeling of am-ness, asmita. It cannot
be called “I” – it is far more refined – just am-ness. And then... the
last jump into nothingness. While he was just moving in, the man came
running.</p><p>He said, “But I have a question.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples said, “Now don’t disturb him. Where have you been? He
has passed through your village at least thirty times.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I know, but sometimes there was such a crowd of customers
in my shop. Sometimes I was engaged in my son’s marriage; sometimes my
wife was sick – and so on and so forth. I always thought, next time when
he comes I will go to him. Just now I heard that he is leaving the
world. What about my question?”</p><p><br></p><p>The people said, “You seem to be an idiot. Thirty times he passed,
and thirty times you missed. And</p><p>now, when he has just taken leave of us... now it cannot be
done.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Buddha came back. He opened his eyes, he said, “No, let him ask.
Let him be answered because I don’t want it to be known in history, for
the coming generations, that a Buddha was alive and yet somebody
returned from his door empty-handed. Let me do my part. If he is ready –
and I can see he is ready; my death has been a shock to him and has made
him ready. I am happy that even my death has helped somebody to be
ready, to listen.”</p><p>He answered his question. The question was not philosophical,
theological, intellectual. The question was really authentic, sincerely
spiritual. But that man had been missing for so many years, just because
of the idea, “Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, any time Buddha comes
and goes, I can go and meet him and ask.”</p><p>He asked – this was the last question to Buddha – “How can I be in a
position so that whether you</p><p>are in the body or not, your presence will remain available to me?
What can I do?”</p><p>He had asked a real religious question. He was asking, “What can I do
so that your presence remains available to me? This time I have missed –
when you were in the body. But I don’t want to miss forever.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha gave him the instructions for meditation, vipassana; how to be
aware of your breathing; how to be aware, silently watchful of the
breath going out, coming in, going out, coming in...”so slowly, slowly
you can be separate from your breathing. The moment you are separate
from your breathing my presence will be available, because you are
separate from your body just as I am separate from my body.”</p><p>If a disciple is ready, even a dead master can be alive. If the
disciple is not ready, then even a living master cannot do anything. It
all depends on the disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s4>2</span></p><p><br></p><p>Here we call work, worship</p><p><br></p><p>2 April 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS WORSHIPPING IN THE COMMUNE RELATED TO MEDITATION? WHY DON’T WE
HAVE ANY</p><p>MEDITATION TIME SEPARATE FROM WORSHIPPING?</p><p>It has been one of the most dangerous ideas down the centuries that
life can be divided into separate parts. Life is indivisible, it is an
organic whole. The moment you divide it you kill it. This is one of the
most fundamental things in my approach towards life: I take it as a
whole.</p><p>And remember, the whole is more than the sum total of its parts. In
the world of machines, the whole is exactly the sum total of its parts;
there is nothing more in it. A clock is nothing more than all its parts
put in a particular arrangement; it functions. Take the parts apart, and
the functioning disappears. But you can put the parts together again,
and the functioning starts again. The functioning of the mechanism is
not something separate.</p><p>Life is totally different from a machine. If you cut a man into
different parts, life will disappear. Now you cannot put those parts
together. And even if you manage somehow to put those parts together,
life is not going to appear again. It categorically proves one thing,
that life is not the sum total of its parts – it is something more, it
is something plus. And that “plus” is the real essence of your
being.</p><p>But down the ages all the religions have been committing a crime: the
crime of dividing the indivisible. But it was favorable to them. A
divided man is a dead man, and to control the dead is the easiest thing
in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>An undivided man is an individual. That’s exactly the meaning of the
word “individual” – indivisible. The individual is dangerous, he is
alive. You cannot enslave him, you cannot oppress him, you cannot
exploit him. You cannot do anything against his wish. His individuality
gives him freedom to think, to express, to be.</p><p>Divisions can be made in very subtle ways.For example, “Religion
should be separate from the state.” What kind of stupidity is this? If
religion is something real, something that vibrates in your being,
something that you breathe, live, then wherever you are – in the church,
in the office, in the marketplace, it does not matter – religion is your
very breathing. It is going to be with you. Then it is going to decide
every step that you take, every word that you utter, every gesture that
you make.</p><p>How can you divide religion from art? A religious man painting is not
in any way separate from his religious being. While painting he is going
to paint religion; whatever he paints is going to be colored by his
religion. The way he lives, the way he loves, the way he dances – all is
going to be in his painting. The painting of a religious man, whatsoever
the subject matter of the painting, will have some fragrance of religion
in it; it is inevitable, there is no way to avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you may not be able to see this, because things are very
subtle. A man of meditation, silence, serenity, is going to have a
different kind of dance from a man who is in anguish, tension, worry,
despair. A man who is living his life totally, intensely, moment to
moment, and a man who is thinking of committing suicide – both can
dance, but their dances will have different qualities. The person who is
thinking of committing suicide, his dance will have the shadow of death
in it. It will stink of death, of a dead body. His movements will not be
movements of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The other man, who loves and lives totally and has a silent space
within himself – that’s what I call meditation – his dance will also
have a silence surrounding it. His movements, his gestures will have a
grace, a beauty, a fragrance of their own.</p><p>You cannot divide man into parts.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is, “Here in our commune, there is no separate time for
meditation.…” It is our basic approach. We cannot have a separate time
for meditation. Meditation should be spread all over your life: eating,
sleeping, taking a bath, or just having a walk, or just sitting doing
nothing. Meditation should be in all these actions, inactions,
activities, non activities. The thread of meditation should continue
underground, whatever you are working at.</p><p>A great master, Nan In, was chopping wood. The king of the country
had come to see him. He had heard so much about Nan In that finally he
could not resist the temptation to go and see the man. Just as he
entered the monastery, near the gate was a man perspiring in the hot
sun, chopping wood.</p><p>Naturally the king thought, “This man must be able to direct me to
where I can find the master” – because it was a vast monastery with five
hundred monks living in it. So he asked the man, who was Nan In himself,
“Please forgive me for interrupting you; you are so absorbed in chopping
wood, you have not even seen that I have been standing here for a few
minutes, waiting. But then I thought it is better to interrupt you
because you are not going to see me of your own accord.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I am sorry, but this is how my life is. Whatever I am
doing I am doing it totally. Nothing of me remains to do anything else.
Chopping wood, I am simply chopping wood. There is nobody else other
than the chopper of wood. So, no need to be embarrassed. What do you
want?”</p><p>He said, “I want to see the master, Nan In.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In said, “You go directly into that hut and wait. The master will
be coming soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king went and waited there. Nan In took a shower, put on his
master’s robe, and came in from the back door. But the king was very
puzzled, because both men looked so alike. He thought, “It is almost an
impossibility. There are not two men alike in the whole world, and just
in this monastery, within a few hundred yards I have seen a man exactly
like this man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In said, “You wanted to see master Nan In – master Nan In is now
here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “That I will enquire about later on. First I want to
know who was chopping wood at the gate.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In laughed. He said, “At that time I was a chopper of wood. Now I
am going to chop your head; now I am a master. We live each moment,
moment to moment, but we are indivisible. The chopper was also master
Nan In. If you had eyes you could have seen my involvement with the
movement, my totality of action, my intensity of being.</p><p>“If you had eyes you could have seen him there; you would not have
asked about master Nan In. You had already met him, but you didn’t know.
Now I am a chopper of heads. That’s the function of a master: to make
you so egoless, to make you so thoughtless that you are almost without a
head, just the heart pulsating with love, with compassion. Have you come
only to ask some questions? Are you really a seeker? Are you ready to
lose something?”</p><p><br></p><p>The king was just confused, shocked, even afraid of the man. He had
never been afraid of anybody, but this man was simply crazy – he was
talking of chopping his head!</p><p>The king said, “You have confused me too much and I am almost falling
apart. Please forgive me this time. I will come another time, because I
have forgotten for what I came.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In said, “You need not come again. I am going to come to you, and
I will follow you wherever you go. Now you cannot escape, because I can
see something really authentic in you. Yes, it is unconscious; you are
not aware of it, much garbage is hiding it. You think you are a king.
Even sitting before me you are still thinking you are a king. This is
garbage – you are just a beggar. And the beggar that I am is really a
king.”</p><p>The king said, “I don’t understand all these puzzles. Please talk to
me without puzzling me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In said, “There is no puzzle in it, it is simple. I am a king
because I don’t need anything in the world. You are a beggar; although
you have a big empire, your desires are unending. You are desiring more
and more and more. The mind that goes on desiring more is the mind of a
beggar. And the consciousness that is content with itself as it is,
utterly content, is the consciousness of an emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Strange,” he said. “You think you are a king, and you look on me as
a beggar. The reality is just the opposite. Go back – and I will be
coming to visit you.” And Nan In followed the king continuously till he
made him aware of his innermost treasure.</p><p>It is dangerous to go to a master, because then escape is almost
impossible. Wherever you go – even if you go to Santa Fe – I am there.
Nothing can save you. Once a master has seen within you a heart that can
grow, that can expand, that can become universal, he is not going to
leave you.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t need to go to Santa Fe. I have my own ways, far more subtle
than Nan In’s. I am continually there; they are talking only about me,
they cannot talk about anything else. Whom are they befooling? Whether
you talk for me or against me does not matter, just go on continuously
talking about me. That’s enough; that is going to change you.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, in the commune, whatever you are doing Here we call work,
worship, for the simple reason</p><p>that work is not just work, it is meditation also. That’s why we call
it worship. Other than this we don’t have any God to worship. We have
only this existence around us. So you can worship it as a gardener, you
can worship it as a farmer, you can worship it as a roadmaker, you can
worship any way you choose to. But whatever you are doing, you are doing
with existence.</p><p>So the question is, if you are doing it lovingly, if you are doing it
meditatively, and if, while you are doing it, you are nowhere else, you
are just there with all of your being, nothing is missing – then work
becomes worship. Work becomes worship because meditation has entered
into it.</p><p><br></p><p>But I can understand your question, because all the religions have
preached that there should be a separate time for meditation. That is
just idiotic. It is as if somebody is saying there should be a separate
time for breathing, that one hour in the morning you breathe and then
forget about it, and for twenty-three hours you do other things. You
need not be disturbed by having to breathe; you can do other things,
breathing continues.</p><p><br></p><p>A thousand and one things continue in your body: the blood goes on
circulating, the pulse goes on functioning, the heart goes on beating.…
Scientists say the body of man is perhaps the greatest miracle in
existence because so much is going on in it. Almost seven million living
cells are continuously working within you. You are the biggest city in
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Seven million living beings are living in you, and they are doing all
kinds of work and doing it perfectly, without any guidance and without
any education, without anybody being the overseer – I mean no God as
overseer. You may go on doing anything, your organic processes
continue.</p><p>To me meditation is an organic process. To other religions it was
not; hence, all those religions have failed. They were bound to fail. It
is not an accident, it was destined; their very base was wrong. What
they called meditation was nothing but some kind of thinking. The
Christian was thinking of Christ, praying to God with folded hands,
kneeling down. He knows neither whether God exists or not, nor whether
Jesus Christ is really a messiah or just a charlatan. He knows nothing,
but out of fear, out of misery, out of anguish, he is praying; and this,
Christianity calls meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is he asking God? He is asking for all those things which he
is missing here in this life, which he cannot manage to create here for
himself. He is asking God, “At least in the other life, give them to me;
I have suffered enough.” He is asking – in fact, deep down it is a
complaint.</p><p><br></p><p>All prayers are complaints; otherwise, what have you got to pray for
if there is no complaint? Every prayer simply means you are condemning
God. You are saying, “You are doing it wrong. Please do it this
way.”</p><p>Even Jesus on the cross condemns God when he says, “Have you forsaken
me?” What does he mean? One thing is certain, he means that he knows
better than God. He knows that somewhere God has gone wrong. He is
angry, he is complaining. He wants God to do a miracle, to prove to the
world that he is his only begotten son, that he has been sent by him. He
is his messenger and he has sent him for the whole world’s
salvation.</p><p><br></p><p>But from the skies no voice comes. On the clouds no angels appear
with their harps, playing “Alleluia” – no sign of God anywhere. In anger
Jesus shouts, “Have you forsaken me?” He is saying, “Have you betrayed
me? Have you gone against your word? You have left me in this helpless
situation. And I believed in you!” This is the moment to prove that God
is love. This is the moment to prove that God comes to save those who
trust in him. But nobody comes.</p><p>All prayers are complaints. All prayers are saying to God, “We know
better than you do.”</p><p><br></p><p>One man came to me – his wife was dying. He was a very religious man.
Every day from three o’clock in the morning up to seven – for four hours
– he was doing all kinds of crazy things. He had so many gods. In India
they are not so miserly about gods. About everything else they are poor,
but about gods they are the richest people in the world: thirty-three
million gods. So everybody who is really religious has a whole
roomful.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirty-three million of course you cannot... but a few
representatives, the topmost, the bigshots, you can keep around. This
man had at least sixty. Now, sixty gods, and only four hours – you can
see, it was not much time. He was in such a hurry, doing a prayer to
this god and rushing to another, then rushing to another, and looking at
his watch continuously because in four hours he has to finish. And the
fear that if he leaves any god, and the god becomes angry.…</p><p>Such a religious man – and his wife was dying, and the doctors were
not able to do anything. They simply said, “She has lost the will to
live. Deep down she does not want to live; hence, no medicine is
effective.” Unless you have a will to live you lose resistance; you
really want to die. Just medicines cannot do much unless a great support
from your will is there.</p><p><br></p><p>So he came to me one day and said, “What should I do? I have done
four hours of prayers each day my whole life, and still my wife is
dying, and out of those sixty gods not a single one is helping. And I
cry and weep.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Please answer me one question. Do you think yourself more
intelligent than God?” He said, “No. How can I think myself more
intelligent than God?”</p><p>Then I said, “If God wants your wife to be freed from the body you
should be happy, you should be thankful. But your prayer is against
God’s will. Those sixty gods that you have cannot help you in any way.
You are not a religious man at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he said, “I have done prayer four hours every day for years.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can pray twenty-four hours, that too will not make any
change, because your whole</p><p>attitude is wrong. You are demanding from existence, you are not
surrendering to existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a surrender, it is not a demand. It is not forcing
existence your way, it is relaxing into the way existence wants you to
be. It is a let-go.</p><p>But all the religions have been doing prayers in the name of
meditation. And what kind of stupid prayers! In fact any prayer that a
man can do is going to be stupid. “Don’t let my wife die” – do you think
that is something very intelligent? If that dodo was a little bit
intelligent – God was making him free, and he is praying against his own
freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you look in the scriptures you will be surprised what kind of
prayers are there. In the VEDAS, the most holy scriptures of the Hindus,
the great seers I cannot even conceive how for centuries</p><p>those people have been called great seers. They should be called the
great blind men! Seers! – they were praying to God: “Please increase the
milk of my cow, decrease the milk of the cow of my enemy, my neighbor.
This time let rains fall only on my field.” Great seers, great saints
and sages – and these are their prayers. But what else can you ask?</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian asks, “Give me my daily bread.” Don’t you have anything
else to ask? Can’t you produce even your daily bread? Even that has to
be provided by God? So what are you doing here? Even your daily bread is
not to be created by you. Just by providing daily bread to all these
millions of Christians for centuries, God must have gone bankrupt!</p><p>Nobody ever thinks of God. Just seeing his misery and anguish I
declared, “There is no God!” In just a single blow I finished all his
misery, all his trouble, all his anguish – past, present, future,
everything; I made it completely clean. Now, let everybody produce his
own daily bread and, if you have some intelligence, a little butter will
also do – but don’t torture God anymore. He is not there; he has never
been there.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should you keep a separate time for meditation? It is based on
the idea of the separation of the sacred and profane. But in life there
is no separation of the sacred and the profane. Life is one, so totally
one that you can call something sacred if you want, you can call it
profane if you want.</p><p>Christians call sex sin, and Tantra, a great Eastern philosophy,
calls sex sacred, the most significant life energy – because all
transformation is going to happen through that energy. Don’t condemn it.
There are people who are condemning sex continuously in every possible
way.</p><p><br></p><p>You can take anything there are Zen people in the East who say that
even sipping a cup of tea in</p><p>the morning can be something sacred. And they have made it sacred. If
you have seen, in a Zen monastery they have a small temple for tea
ceremonies, and when anybody goes to the tea ceremony he enters into a
sacred space.</p><p><br></p><p>He leaves his shoes outside; there are special wooden sandals
provided inside. Everybody is silent, because the samovar is boiling the
tea and a beautiful music is coming out of it. It has to be listened to.
People sit on their knees, just the way they sit in the temple, around
the samovar. They all listen silently to the boiling noise of the tea,
and they smell the fresh and rejuvenating fragrance of the tea. And
absolute silence falls on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the server, who is usually a woman, comes; and in a very sacred
manner she provides cups and saucers, which are all handmade. In a Zen
monastery they don’t use cups and saucers purchased in the market; those
are produced inhumanly, mechanically, for nobody particular. They are
just for the market.</p><p>In the Zen monastery they make their own cups, their own saucers,
with love, with meditation. Something of their love and meditation
certainly enters into their cups and saucers and pots. And the way the
woman places them before you – she places them as if she is serving a
god. Christians don’t even know how to move Jesus’ statue from one place
to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she pours the tea; just the sound of the tea being poured is
listened to – no talk at all. And then people start sipping tea,
enjoying it, forgetting the whole world. Just sipping tea has become
sacred. It depends on you.</p><p>There is nothing profane in the world, nothing sacred in the world.
The world is neutral. Now it depends on you what you want to make of it.
Meditation makes it sacred; then every act becomes meditative.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a butcher in Japan who was considered to be a great
master – and he was a butcher! The whole day he was cutting animals and
selling meat; that was his business. One Buddhist scholar could not
believe that this man was thought to be a saint. He was simply a
scholar. He went to the butcher and said, “This is something absolutely
mad. Who are the people who think that you are a saint? How can a
butcher be a saint?”</p><p><br></p><p>The butcher laughed. He answered, “Just by mixing meditation in the
butchery. When I am cutting up an animal I am not angry, I am not
hateful. I am full of love, I am full of compassion. I have great hope
that next time he will be born in a human form; perhaps he will become a
buddha. With all my blessings I am sending him on a new journey,
releasing him from this prison.</p><p><br></p><p>“And moreover, my father was a butcher, my forefathers were butchers,
and I am a poor butcher. I have never told anybody that I am a saint. If
people think so, that’s their business. You should go and argue with
them.</p><p>“As far as I am concerned, I am absolutely content with my profession
because whatever you do, the question is not what you are doing but how
you are doing it. The question is not the act; the question is the
consciousness with which the act is being performed. Yes, I am killing
animals, but I know that they will be killed anyway. If I am not killing
them, somebody else will kill them. And he will not kill them with such
love, with such compassion. How can I leave this profession?</p><p><br></p><p>“These animals are going to be killed. If I don’t kill them somebody
else will kill them and he is not going to kill them with such
meditation, with such love. So I would be leaving these poor animals in
the hands of some butcher. I cannot do that. If I am going to be thrown
into hell for being a butcher, that is acceptable. But I cannot leave
these poor innocent animals in the hands of somebody who knows nothing
of love.”</p><p>Can you see the point of this butcher? It is very subtle. He is ready
to suffer in hell if that is going to be the consequence of his actions.
But he cannot leave these poor animals in the hands of somebody who will
simply kill them and not even bother about what he is doing.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am so concerned with these animals and I love them so
much – I cannot leave them in</p><p>somebody else’s hands. Whatsoever happens to me, that I am ready to
face.”</p><p><br></p><p>I can see why the people who could understand called him a master, a
saint. He never gave a sermon, he never preached anything. He was
illiterate, he knew nothing of the scriptures, but he lived religion in
a very irreligious situation; that’s something tremendously important.
He lived religion in something which is very irreligious. And yet he
managed to live religiously. He must have been a great alchemist who
transformed the whole act, gave it a new quality; something utterly
profane and ugly became so beautiful, so graceful.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that his fame spread far and wide and people started
coming to see him while he was cutting up animals. Even the emperor of
Japan came to see him while he was cutting because he had heard that the
way he cuts, nobody has ever cut – such grace, such love, tears flowing
from his eyes. And the miracle was that although human beings were not
able to understand, perhaps the animals were able to understand.</p><p>Ordinarily when you want to kill an animal he tries to escape, but
from this butcher no animal tried to escape. He hugged the animal. The
animal was not bound by anything, tied with anything. He was completely
free. It was as if deep down he wanted to die by this man’s hand.</p><p><br></p><p>And the emperor asked one thing, about the knife that he used to kill
the animals. The knife looked so shiny, as if it had just been
sharpened. The emperor asked, “Do you sharpen your knife every day?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, this is the knife my father used, and his father used,
and it has never been sharpened. But we know exactly the points where it
has to cut the animal so there is a minimum of pain possible – through
the joints where two bones meet. The knife has to go through the joint,
and those two bones that meet there go on sharpening the knife. And that
is the point where the animal is going to feel the minimum pain.</p><p>“For three generations we have not sharpened the knife. A butcher
sharpening a knife simply means he does not know his art” – he used the
word “art” – “He does not know the art and he does not know how to do it
lovingly.”</p><p><br></p><p>My commune is in meditation twenty-four hours a day; whatever you are
doing, or not doing, is immaterial. Just be loving, be alert, do it with
joy. Whatever you are doing, do it as if this is the greatest thing in
the world at this juncture of time. It may be just cutting the grass,
watering the road; it may be anything. Washing the floor, do it as if
the whole existence depends on what you are doing, it is indispensable;
without it, the whole universe will collapse.</p><p>When you do anything with such intensity, with such love, with such
respect, as if without it the whole universe will collapse, then there
is no need to have a separate time for meditation. And those who are
doing meditations as separate from life are simply deceiving themselves
and nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi teaches his people, “Do transcendental
meditation ten minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening, and
that’s enough.” And what is his transcendental meditation? Just repeat
any stupid name... go on repeating “Rama, Rama, Rama” – that is a Hindu
name – or,</p><p><br></p><p>“Ave Maria, Ave Maria, Ave Maria.” Any name, in fact your own name
will do – just go on repeating it.</p><p>Repeat it as fast as possible because that’s the whole secret of the
technique.</p><p><br></p><p>If for ten minutes you go on repeating a single word fast enough
continuously, you autohypnotize yourself. After just four or five
minutes you start falling into a deliberate kind of sleep which is
called hypnosis. Yes, after ten minutes you will feel good, you will
feel fresh, you will feel relaxed. So nothing is wrong with it – but it
is not meditation. It is just a way of resting, having a good nap.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do it, but remember, it has nothing to do with meditation. It
is perfectly good, healthy, psychologically and physically relaxing, but
that’s all it is. It has nothing to do with transcendence; it is not
transcendental at all. It is not going to take you into your innermost
being, it is not going to take you into some higher state of
consciousness; it is not going to take you anywhere. After ten minutes
you will be back where you were. You will remain the same person. You
will not be transformed by it.</p><p>And unless something transforms you it is not meditation: something
that makes you a new being, a new man, a new consciousness; which knows
no fear, which knows no greed, which knows no hate; which knows nothing
of those dark emotions, sentiments – ugly, sick, nauseating. ... a new
consciousness, which knows only that which uplifts you, that which goes
on uplifting you – there is no end to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation brings you to a state where you are above the stars,
bigger than the whole universe. That experience is what I call
transformation, illumination, enlightenment.</p><p>So don’t be worried that there are not separate times for you to
meditate. It is not an oversight, it is done with full consideration. I
don’t want to give you the impression that meditation can be done
separately from your life and its work.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s4>3</span></p><p><br></p><p>My religion is a godless religion</p><p><br></p><p>30 June 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>NOW THAT GOD IS DEAD HOW CAN WE QUICKLY DISPOSE OF HIS REMAINS?</p><p><br></p><p>God is not dead now, he has been dead always, so the question of
disposing of his remains does not arise. God has never existed and
cannot exist, for the simple reason that the whole existence is
godliness. To divide God and existence, the creator and the creation, is
a stupid duality.</p><p>One has to see the implications of it: God creating a world – from
where? Something must have existed as a building material before God
created the world. And if he can create the world like a magician then
he is an idiotic magician. One can see the world as a proof. Is this the
world a wise man will create? – to say nothing of a wise God.</p><p><br></p><p>This world shows absolutely that there is nobody behind it
consciously creating it; otherwise all the nonsense that exists here
should not be. God created the world at a certain time, at a certain
date – according to Christians, who are the most foolish of all the
religions, he created the world four thousand and four years before
Jesus was born. It must have been Monday, the first of January, or
perhaps the first of April – that seems to be more appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>And what did he create? In three thousand years, five thousand wars
have been fought – and this is the creation of God. His highest creation
is man, and the whole of humanity is on the verge of</p><p><br></p><p>committing a global suicide. This God must be some kind of a sadist.
It is better that we simply forget all about God.</p><p>In the courts, THE BIBLE is presented to take oaths on. It is full of
lies. In these two thousand years since Jesus, almost everything in THE
BIBLE has become a lie. What about Charles Darwin? What about Albert
Einstein?</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I wonder: have we lost all intelligence? It would be better
to provide Albert Einstein’s book to take an oath on. THE BIBLE is so
full of obscenity, it is an insult to every court to have a BIBLE inside
it. It is a contempt of court. And wonder of wonders, you have to take
an oath that you will speak only the truth!</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is born out of a virgin girl – I cannot take any oath on such
rubbish. If a virgin girl can give birth to Jesus then everything is
right; then there is no lie anywhere in the world, all is truth, you
cannot lie – but this is impossible in the very nature of things.</p><p>The Old Testament says that God created the world. He created two
daughters and made love to both of them. Now, the father making love to
his own daughters – and this is a religious book! And this is your God!
Hang him if you can find him.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not only so about Christianity, it is more or less the
same with all religions. No sane person can believe in God; only insane,
retarded, utterly mediocre people can believe in God.</p><p>I have not found a single reason or argument given by thousands of
priests of all the religions which has any validity. Still God continues
to be worshipped. You have made him out of your foolishness, and you are
worshipping him, praying to him. This is not the way to change the
world, or man, or his consciousness.</p><p>So please don’t say, “Now that God is dead.” He has never been in the
first place, so he cannot be</p><p>dead.</p><p>I agree on many points with that madman Friedrich Nietzsche, but I
don’t agree on this point – that God is dead. Not that God is not dead –
he has never been anywhere. Only existence is. Yes, there is a
possibility of consciousness evolving, higher and higher. The moment
consciousness comes to its highest peak it does not find any God there.
It finds immense beauty, immense silence, absolute nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>This I am saying on my own authority and through my own experience.
You cannot go beyond absolute peace, silence, ecstasy. It goes on
growing, but you never can go beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, my religion is a godless religion.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no question of, no problem of disposing of the remains –
there are none. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>BEING WITH YOU I FEEL SO BLISSFUL AND LIBERATED, AND THERE SEEMS TO
BE NO END TO IT. YOU MUST HAVE TRICKED ME. WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?</p><p>I am a simple man without any secret. I am just an open book, and a
book in which nothing is written. If you like to call it a secret it is
your choice, but it is a very open secret.</p><p>If you want to be, learn the art of being:</p><p><br></p><p>not to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat it, because I know you are deaf. If you want really to
be, the only way is to learn not to be. Disappear. Just as God
disappears from existence, you have to disappear from your life. Let
life flow of its own accord.</p><p>It is the simplest art in the world, to be silent. It is not a doing,
it is a non-doing. How can it be difficult?</p><p><br></p><p>I am showing you the way of enlightenment through laziness. Nothing
has to be done to attain it, because it is your nature. You have already
got it. You are just so busy with outer business that you cannot see
your own nature.</p><p>Deep within you is exactly the same as outside you: the beauty, the
silence, the ecstasy, the blissfulness. But please, sometimes be kind to
yourself: just sit down and don’t do anything, either physically or
mentally. Relax, not in an American way... because I have seen so many
American books titled HOW TO RELAX. The very title says that the man
knows nothing about relaxation. There is no “how.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is okay – “How to Repair a Car”; you will have to do
something. But there is no doing as such as far as relaxation is
concerned. Just don’t do anything. I know you will find it a little
difficult in the beginning. That is not because relaxation is difficult,
it is because you have become addicted to doing something. That
addiction will take a little time to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be, and watch. Being is not doing, and watching is also not
doing. You sit silently doing nothing, witnessing whatsoever is
happening. Thoughts will be moving in your mind; your body may be
feeling some tension somewhere, you may have a migraine. Just be a
witness. Don’t be identified with it. Watch, be a watcher on the hills,
and everything else is happening in the valley. It is a knack, not an
art.</p><p>Meditation is not a science. It is not an art, it is a knack – just
that way. All that you need is a little patience.</p><p>The old habits will continue; the thoughts will go on rushing. And
your mind is always in a rush hour, the traffic is always jammed. Your
body is not accustomed to sitting silently – you will be tossing and
turning. Nothing to be worried about. Just watch that the body is
tossing and turning, that the mind is whirling, is full of thoughts –
consistent, inconsistent, useless – fantasies, dreams. You remain in the
center, just watching.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions of the world have taught people to do something:
stop the process of thought, force the body into a still posture. That’s
what yoga is – a long practice of forcing the body to be still. But a
forced body is not still. And all the prayers, concentrations,
contemplations of all the religions do the same with the mind: they
force it, they don’t allow the thoughts to move. Yes, you have the
capacity to do it. And if you persist you may be able to stop the
thought process. But this is not the real thing, it is absolutely
fake.</p><p><br></p><p>When stillness comes on its own, when silence descends without your
effort, when you watch thoughts and a moment comes when thoughts start
disappearing and silence starts happening, that is beautiful. The
thoughts stop of their own accord if you don’t identify, if you remain a
witness and you don’t say, “This is my thought.”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t say, “This is bad, this is good,” “This should be there.…”
and “This should not be there<span class=s6></span>”</p><p>Then you are not a watcher; you have prejudices, you have certain
attitudes. A watcher has no prejudice, he has no judgment. He simply
sees like a mirror.</p><p>When you bring something in front of a mirror it reflects, simply
reflects. There is no judgment that the man is ugly, that the man is
beautiful, that, “Aha! What a good nose you have got.” The mirror has
nothing to say. Its nature is to mirror; it mirrors. This is what I call
meditation: you simply mirror everything within or without.</p><p>And I guarantee you I can guarantee because it has happened to me and
to many of my people;</p><p>just watching patiently – maybe a few days will pass, maybe a few
months, maybe a few years. There is no way of saying because each
individual has a different collection.</p><p>You must have seen people collecting antiques, postal stamps.
Everybody has a different collection; the quantity may be different,
hence the time it takes will be different – but go on remaining a
witness as much as you can. And this meditation needs no special time.
You can wash the floor and remain silently watching yourself washing the
floor.</p><p>I can move my hand unconsciously, without watching, or I can move it
with full awareness. And there is a qualitative difference. When you
move it unconsciously it is mechanical. When you move it with
consciousness there is grace. Even in the hand, which is part of your
body, you will feel silence, coolness – what to say about the mind?</p><p><br></p><p>With your watching and watching, slowly the rush of thoughts starts
getting less and less. Moments of silence start appearing; a thought
comes, and then there is silence before another thought appears. These
gaps will give you the first glimpse of meditation and the first joy
that you are arriving home.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon the gaps will be bigger, and finally the gap is always with you.
You may be doing something, the silence is there. You may not be doing
anything, the silence is there. Even in sleep the silence is there.</p><p><br></p><p>For a meditator there are no dreams; dreams and thoughts are
cousin-brothers, there is not much difference. If thoughts disappear,
dreams disappear. And if for twenty-four hours a day you are surrounded
by silence you will come to know what my secret is.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go near a lake, you start feeling cool. There is no secret in
it – it is the milieu. You go to the forest and you feel the difference
in the atmosphere. You are the same but the atmosphere around you is
different.</p><p>When you come closer to me... and to come closer to me you are not to
walk and sit by my side. To come closer to me is to be not a Christian,
not a Hindu, not a Mohammedan, not a Buddhist, not a communist. To come
close to me means that you don’t cling to any ideology, you don’t go on
holding onto the past. To come close to me means you start living moment
to moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither the past means anything to you, nor are you worried about the
future. This very moment becomes the only reality. In fact it is the
only reality. And if you can be in this moment, you can be on a faraway
star but you will be close to me and you will feel a serenity, a
silence, a lovingness such as you have never known.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not doing anything, remember, so don’t be grateful to me. I am a
non-doer – I am just being available. That is not much of a doing. I am
available, like the trees in the forest and the lakes and the ocean, and
the sun and the moon. I am available. Now it is up to you to come close
to me, or go away from me.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can come close to me you will start feeling things that have
been unknown to you, and soon you will realize that what you are feeling
close to me you can feel yourself wherever you are. That is the greatest
moment of happiness for a master, when his disciple can be on his
own.</p><p><br></p><p>You must know the meaning of being a disciple, people have forgotten;
it comes from “discipline.”</p><p>And all the religions have corrupted the meaning of discipline; its
root meaning is learning. Coming close is learning.</p><p>What I have got, you have got.</p><p><br></p><p>I am aware of it, you are not aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming close to me you will learn, “My God! This has always been with
me, and I have been searching all over the world, looking into the
books, scriptures, seeking the teachers, becoming a member of rotten
cults like Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism – all dead.”</p><p>Yes, when Buddha was there what is happening to you was happening to
his people. But when Buddha is gone what is left behind is mere words,
containers; the content is not there. You can go on decorating the
containers, but that will not help. You know perfectly well that your
statues in the temples, your scriptures in the churches, are just dust
of the past. It is better to be finished with them.</p><p>But why are you seeking? You are seeking because you are not aware
that you have got it already. I cannot give it to you. I can only make
you aware, and for that nothing is needed but availability on my part,
availability on your part. If these two availabilities are there, two
opennesses, without any conditions, it clicks. Suddenly you become a
mirror, and the moment you become a mirror you become a master. The same
will start happening around you.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t want you always to remain disciples. That will be a
shame.</p><p>In the past all the religions have tried just the opposite of what I
am doing. That’s why they cannot believe that this is a religion. I am
changing the very definition and the foundations. Those old religions
were saying that Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of God, you are
not. He is special, you are ordinary. He comes with a message from God,
from above. He has a speciality, he is extra-ordinary.</p><p>At the most you can be Christians, but you cannot be a Christ. Have
you thought about it, that in two thousand years nobody has been a
Christ again? What kind of religion is this? Just Christians! The first
and the last Christ was crucified two thousand years ago; since then
nothing has happened, because unless you become a Christ your
Christianity is just a hypocrisy. The same is true about other
religions.</p><p>Once it happened in Baghdad – Caliph Omar was the sovereign. A man
was brought to him who was claiming that he had been sent by God and
that he brought the latest word of God, the latest message, because
Mohammed’s message was thirteen hundred years old, and in thirteen
hundred years a new message – better, more polished, more sophisticated
– was needed. He had been sent by God.</p><p>Now, Mohammedans cannot accept anybody as a prophet after Mohammed.
No religion accepts anybody else as a prophet. Christians cannot accept
anybody as a Christ. Buddhists cannot accept another as a Buddha. Why?
Why this similarity? There is some arithmetic behind it. A new prophet
will disturb the gullible, the old believers, because he will say
something new. He may say something against the KORAN, THE BIBLE, the
GITA; he is bound to.</p><p>I cannot agree with Krishna, the GITA that he had spoken five
thousand years ago. Five thousand years have not gone just as a waste;
man’s consciousness has risen, intelligence has become more solid. And
what Krishna teaches is violence. If Krishna is right, then the third
world war is perfectly okay.</p><p>I cannot give that okay to the third world war. Krishna says, “It is
God’s will. If he wants the war, all your pacifists can go on parading
in the capitals of the world with posters against war – it will not
change anything. If God wants the war then the war is going to happen.”
That is the message of the GITA. Arjuna, Krishna’s chief disciple and
friend, tried hard to argue.</p><p>But those arguments are all ordinary. If I had been in his place,
just a single sentence from me would have been enough – there would have
been no need to make such a big book. I would have said to Krishna,
“This is God’s will, that I am going to the Himalayas. Who are you to
interpret God’s will? And how can I accept it, that your interpretation
is right? You say that God wants the war – I say no.”</p><p>And in fact the no seems to be more rational, more loving, more
meaningful, more humane. Rather than arguing with that man, Arjuna had
just to say: “I have accepted your idea that whatsoever happens, happens
according to God” – and then should have left for the Himalayas.</p><p>He wanted to be a sannyasin, a meditator in the Himalayas. Krishna
would not have been able to stop him – just because of his own argument.
Arjuna could have said, “If war is to happen, God will bring me back –
but you keep quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Hindus would not like anybody else to be accepted as a prophet
of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed talks nonsense. You cannot expect anything better from an
uneducated man who could not write, who could not read, who had never
been in any way a meditative man.</p><p><br></p><p>He married nine women. Now, I cannot support that, because in the
world men and women are almost in equal proportions. If one man marries
nine women then what about the eight men who will be left without women?
Then California will be all over the world. That catastrophe I cannot
allow. I would rather that California went down into the ocean with all
its homosexuals, with all its perverts. It would be better, far more
beneficial, and a blessing to humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>But Mohammed marries nine women – of course; he is a messenger of
God. Mohammedans he allows to marry four women – naturally; he has to
keep himself higher. Mohammedans are still marrying four women. Anyone
with any intelligence can see the point: these are the people who create
prostitution. They have created prostitutes, because what about the
three men whose women they have married?</p><p>And can you understand a simple, biological thing? You cannot even
satisfy a single woman sexually, what about four or nine? – because
recent research shows that a woman is capable of multiple orgasms. A man
is not capable of that. If he is young, below thirty-five, he may be
able to have one orgasm. And I am saying maybe. It is not certain,
because man is in such a hurry that before the orgasm can happen he is
finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Orgasm needs a certain patience, to move with the woman, with the
same pace. The woman moves slowly. By the time she comes close to her
orgasm, the man has gone to sleep and is snoring. Eighty percent of
women in the world have not known what orgasm is. And in a country like
India, ninety-nine percent of women know nothing about orgasm.</p><p><br></p><p>Biologically, a man cannot satisfy four women. Then those women are
going to look around the neighborhood. These religions have created all
kinds of perversions: prostitution, obscenity. And if these men cannot
find women, at least they can look at PLAYBOY – just pictures of naked
women! One feels the world has lived in an insane way. Will your hunger
be satisfied by seeing beautiful dishes in a picture? Can you eat them?
But that is what is happening to man’s sexuality.</p><p>He looks into magazines – vulgar, obscene – of naked women. For what?
– when there are equal numbers of women available, living, alive, not
just photographs.</p><p><br></p><p>Four women to one man! But this is nothing, four or nine; Krishna had
sixteen thousand women to himself! I sometimes start wondering...
sixteen thousand women. Even to remember their names is difficult.</p><p>I know, because I have more than half a million sannyasins around the
world; I cannot remember their names. And Krishna lived only ninety
years. In ninety years how did he manage to make love to sixteen
thousand women? Perhaps to one woman once in her life... and then she
was abandoned. This is ugly.</p><p>That’s why new prophets are not allowed by any religion – because
they will look, scrutinize, see that these things are ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>In Baghdad this man declared, “I am the prophet of God, the latest,
and I bring a more sophisticated message than Mohammed.” Mohammedans
could not tolerate it. Omar himself was a very cultured man.… Now you
may be cultured, but your Mohammedanism is there; it goes on poisoning
you. Omar sent the man to the prison, told the guards, “Don’t give him
food. Bind him to a pole, beat him continuously, and don’t let him
sleep. After seven days I will come to ask what he thinks.”</p><p>After seven days he came. The man was almost dying, without food,
without sleep, continuously beaten for twenty-four hours a day. Omar
laughed and said, “Now have you changed your mind, or do you still think
you are the last messenger of God?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed more loudly than Omar and said, “This torture for
seven days proves that I am the prophet of God, because when I was
leaving him to take my voyage to the earth, I asked him, ‘They have not
behaved well with prophets in the past – what is going to happen to me?’
He said, ‘You will be tortured.’ You have proved that I am really the
prophet of God. Before this torture sometimes I used to doubt, to think
that perhaps I am imagining, but now there is no question of doubt.”</p><p>At that very moment, from another pole, another naked man who had
been there for one month continuously being tortured, shouted, “Omar,
don’t listen to that idiot! I have not sent him. After Mohammed I have
not sent anybody else.” One month before this man had been caught
declaring himself God!</p><p><br></p><p>These religions are just dead history. They cannot give you anything.
Only a living master is capable of creating an atmosphere I call the
buddhafield, the field for awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have chosen Oregon because I could not find so many sleepy
people anywhere else in the world; otherwise, who has heard of any
prophet in Oregon? I thought, “Even a small place like Judea can claim
Jesus, Jerusalem can claim Moses, small places like Mecca and Medina can
claim Mohammed. Oregon is absolutely impotent.” I thought it would be
good; hence I am here.</p><p><br></p><p>But to wake up a sleepy man is always a difficult job. The sleepy man
does not want to wake up. Sleep helps him to forget all the worries of
life, the troubles of life. Sleep is a narcotic. It is a drug naturally
provided by biology; otherwise you would all go mad. Six, eight hours of
sleep help you to keep on dragging your life towards the grave.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally Oregonians are disturbed: we are celebrating here. And what
are they doing? They are collecting National Guard vehicles in Madras –
as if this is an army and we are going to attack and start the third
world war. We believe in love, we believe in silence. We believe that
man can live in coexistence with nature, with other people.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only city which has no crime, but it has been declared by
the attorney general of Oregon to be illegal. This is how sleepy people
behave. In their sleep the only legal city looks illegal to them! We
have no crime, no prostitutes, no stealing, no drugs. this is our fault.
For us to be peaceful, to be silent, just to be happy, they cannot
tolerate. They cannot believe it, because it has never happened in their
life – poor people! I really feel sorry for them.</p><p>This place is creating a New Man.</p><p><br></p><p>But naturally the old mind will create every difficulty, will use
every means so that the New Man is not born. Why? – it hurts. Seeing a
man dancing, singing, enjoying, peaceful with himself and existence
hurts those people who have become accustomed to living in misery, who
have become accustomed to living a life which is not living at all. They
cannot tolerate you.</p><p>I have heard about a woman who was ugly, really ugly. She used to
break mirrors; wherever she found a mirror she would break it
immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>People asked, “Are you mad? Why do you break mirrors?” She said,
“These mirrors make me ugly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now you will be becoming mirrors amongst sleepy people. You will
disturb their sleep. They are going to destroy you. And remember, you
are very few – they are many.</p><p>But one thing is positively in your favor: you have something – you
have a contentment. They are empty. Just kick the empty boxes as hard as
you can! Perhaps they may wake up and thank you for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE ONLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ABLE TO REALIZE TRUE RELIGION? DOES
THE MEDIOCRE MIND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO KNOW ONESELF?</p><p>Religion is the highest luxury in the world. The idiot cannot realize
it while remaining an idiot. The mediocre cannot even conceive its
possibility while remaining mediocre. Only the highest intelligence can
reach to that point where religion flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion needs courage, intelligence, daring, because you are going
higher and higher in the world of consciousness. The mediocre has no
idea that there is anything higher than himself. The only possibility
for the mediocre is that he can drop his mediocrity.</p><p>Nobody is born mediocre. People are made mediocre by the politicians,
by the priests, by the education system. You think you go to the school
to be made more intelligent – you are wrong. You go to the college, you
to go the university, you have a masters degree, you can have a Ph.D.,
you can become a D.Litt. A D.Litt means that now the society has
recognized that the doors for the evolution of your consciousness are
completely closed. Now for you there is no way.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole educational system is arranged in such a way that it
teaches you, trains you for memory, not for intelligence – and these two
things are totally different. A very intelligent man may not have a very
good memory. In fact to have a good memory means you are mediocre. A
good memory simply proves you are only a computer, not even a man, so
what has been fed into you you can repeat.</p><p>You can see it very easily: the people who top the universities, come
first in the class, receive golden medals – where do they all disappear
in the world? Their gold medals don’t shine in the world. In</p><p><br></p><p>the world you will not be able to recognize them. Educational systems
train you for a good memory, so you can repeat absolutely useless
things.</p><p>When was Genghis Khan born? Now what purpose does that serve? If he
had not been born it would have been better. At least we can do one
thing, we can remove him from our memory; he was a nightmare. When did
the second world war begin? This is history, you have to memorize it.
And when you memorize history – Genghis Khan, Nadir Shah, Alexander the
Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and other idiots
who may be in the history, or who are right now making history, who soon
will be part of the history.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to forget these people. It would have been better if
there had been no second world war. That is the only way to prevent the
third world war. Forget all this nonsense that man has been doing to
man.</p><p>But the whole educational system is to make you memorize. And man’s
mind is capable of memorizing without any limit. It has been found that
that is possible because in a man’s small skull there are millions of
cells which memorize. It is just like tape recording. All the books in
all the libraries of the world can be memorized by a single person –
that much capacity your memory has. But then you get lost in your
memory, you forget what intelligence is. Intelligence is totally
different.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is the capacity to be silent, to be awake, to be able to
see the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody is interested in truth; in fact they are all against it,
because what will happen to all these politicians around the world who
are constantly lying? If truth is known they will go down the drain. You
are fed with lies and you are distracted from intelligence towards
memory. Memory is part of your brain, and you live your whole life in
your brain. That’s why I say only intelligent people can be
religious.</p><p>Just by being a Christian, going every Sunday to the church,
listening to the same boring sermon.… And there is never any argument,
because argument brings intelligence in.</p><p>Every religion expects you to believe; the unbeliever is condemned.
And without doubt you cannot increase your intelligence. This is the
trouble. All the religions are helping you to remain mediocre, stupid,
by emphasizing belief: belief in God, belief in the virgin birth of
Jesus Christ Believe,</p><p>because those who believe will attain to paradise. All the religions
are giving you good awards – just believe.</p><p>Just the other day I came to know that in New York the
anti-abortionists were having a conference: abortion should be no longer
legal, it should become a crime. All the religions of the world agree on
such points. It is very strange: they don’t agree on any theological
points, but on this point Hindus agree, Mohammedans agree, Christians
agree, Jews agree, everybody agrees – abortion is a sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Mother Teresa was in the conference, speaking against abortion, and
she said, “There is violence in</p><p>the world because of abortion.”</p><p><br></p><p>I could not believe it. If someone had said, “The violence in the
world is because of overpopulation,”</p><p>that would have sounded more true. But this old woman is given a
Nobel prize – for what? Everything</p><p><br></p><p>she does is against humanity. What arguments did she place before the
conference? Why does abortion create violence in the world? Because
abortion means you are killing a living body, you are making people
killers of their own children, that opens the door to violence. The
argument looks good, but it only looks good.</p><p>At what point is the child alive? If abortion creates violence, then
at what point is the child alive? At the time when the male and female
living cells meet – is that the point of life? It has to be, because
otherwise from where will life come? But if it is life, that means that
when the living cells were male and female, when the female eggs were in
a woman’s body and the male cells were in a man’s body – were they alive
or not?</p><p>Celibacy kills more than anything else, because if a nun, a celibate
nun, who is not going to produce a</p><p>child at all<span class=s6></span>then all those living cells that
she brings from her mother’s womb<span class=s6></span>In a woman’s
body</p><p>cells don’t grow, she brings them from birth. All those eggs waiting
to be alive, waiting to be Ronald Reagan – they die without any
chance.</p><p>And do you know a man, a single man, produces in his whole life, from
age fourteen up to fifty, so</p><p>many living cells that that single man can populate the whole world.
What to say about a celibate monk? Every single monk is killing millions
of people!</p><p>From where does the violence begin? If anybody is responsible then it
is Mother Teresa, the pope, their God. Why does he go on and on
producing eggs and living sperms? It is time to stop. Already the world
is four times more populated than it should be. If the world population
can be reduced to one-fourth there will be no poverty, no violence;
thousands of problems will disappear.</p><p>But Mother Teresa is given a Nobel prize because she helps orphans,
opens orphanages around the world. She is creating problems; these
orphans will create children. And she is against abortion, because if
abortion is legal from where is she going to get the orphans? And what
about the Nobel prize? This senile woman is driving people crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Absolute birth control is needed at least for two decades. Absolute,
I say! Not that you have to stop after two children or three children –
no, that will not help.</p><p><br></p><p>Half the world is dying of starvation, and you will be surprised to
know that the poor countries, the starving countries, produce more
children, for the simple reason that they don’t have any other means of
passing their time. To go to the movies, money is needed; to go to a
disco, money is needed. Sex is the only free entertainment.</p><p><br></p><p>Absolute birth control is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only city where no child has been born in four years.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless we cut the world population there is no way to avoid violence.
People are hungry, people are starving, dying. When somebody is hungry
he is going to steal. When somebody is dying, what does he care if he
kills somebody else and gets money to survive? – because lust for life
is the basis of all biological growth. A man can do anything to
survive.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, if abortion becomes illegal... the pope would like to
make all birth control methods illegal. If abortion is illegal, if birth
control methods are illegal, can you think what will happen to this
world? Everybody will be at everybody else’s neck just to survive.</p><p>And it has to be remembered that birth control and abortion have
given women equality, the same status as men; otherwise the woman can
never be equal to man. In poor countries she is continually giving
birth, a child every year. She is always pregnant. She cannot work, she
cannot be financially independent. She cannot get as educated as man,
she cannot be in politics; she has to take care of the children.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth control methods, abortion – these have made possibilities for
women to be equal to men; otherwise all talk about equality is bogus,
false, pseudo.</p><p><br></p><p>But strange... Mother Teresa is a woman, and she has there two or
three dozen nuns – who are all women. She has an order of nuns, and they
don’t even see that not a single woman has been accepted as pope in
these two thousand years. Not a single woman has been accepted as a
Christ, a buddha, a prophet – no. If a woman manages somehow to get into
religious matters she is called a witch.</p><p>The word is not bad, but Christians have given it a bad connotation.
Literally the word “witch” means a wise woman. But when you call a woman
a witch you do not mean that she is wise. These popes have been
declaring women witches – not only declaring, they have been burning
women alive, thousands of women. During the whole Middle Ages they were
burning witches.</p><p><br></p><p>Who were these witches? What were they doing? They were interfering
in religious matters, and man would not like any woman to enter into the
hierarchy of religion; otherwise, she may become a prophet, she may
become a pope, she may declare herself a Christ.</p><p>In Hinduism women are not allowed to read the scriptures. In fact
there is no time for them – taking care of the house, taking care of the
children... and they are continuously pregnant. This is what Mother
Teresa wants. This is what your popes, your bishops want. They will
create a mediocre world. They want a mediocre world, just on the
survival level.</p><p>Remember one simple scientific truth, that if a plant does not get
enough water, enough food, enough air, then the first thing to disappear
will be the flowers. They are the most delicate. The higher a thing is,
the more delicate it is, the more fragile it is. Then the leaves will
start disappearing, then the branches will start disappearing. At the
end there will be only roots, underground.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the situation in every dimension: if you don’t allow man
comfort, luxury, time, he will</p><p>never reach to higher peaks. He is, on the contrary, prevented from
reaching towards religion.</p><p>The first thing religions say is: Believe. That is against true
religion. I say to you, doubt everything, unless you discover something
which you cannot doubt. I don’t say to believe. I say, find out
something which, even if you want to, you cannot doubt: it is there, a
reality, a truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on doubting. Doubt is the method of a true religion – just as it
is a method of a true science. By doubting you eliminate all that is
wrong, and finally only that which is true remains in your hand. Try</p><p><br></p><p>to doubt it too. But you cannot – it is there. And when truth is
known – lived, not believed – only then do you understand what religion
is.</p><p>All these religions are anti-religious. The religions that exist in
the world are anti-religious. My effort is to create the first religion
in the world. All these people have been preventing religion from
happening; hence, they are all against me.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised... it has never happened before – all religions
are against me. They have never been against anybody all together; on
this point they are in agreement. And, even more surprising, atheists
are against me. They too agree with the theists on this point.
Communists are against me. They don’t believe in God, they don’t believe
in the soul, they don’t believe in meditation, but they are also in
agreement with people who believe in God, who believe in the soul, who
believe in all kinds of things. On only one point, one single point, are
they all agreed.</p><p>This has never happened; it is happening now for the simple reason
that I am clearly giving you the indication.</p><p><br></p><p>My fingers are pointing towards the truth.</p><p>Belief is not needed, scriptures are not needed, prophets are not
needed, God is not needed. A tremendous courage to doubt everything is
needed. It is your doubting capacity which will sharpen your
intelligence, destroy your mediocrity. But remember, with your
mediocrity many other things will be destroyed which depend on
mediocrity. So beware, I am a dangerous man.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to be intelligent you cannot be in politics. Politics
needs idiots, people who can lie, people who can go on lying, people who
have double faces, people who can change their personality any moment.
They don’t have any individuality. If you want to be intelligent you
cannot be in any politics.</p><p>If you want to be really religious you cannot be a member of any
religious cult. You have to be free. You have to be individual, you have
to be on your own. It will be fearful in the beginning because you have
always lived in the crowd. The crowd gives you a certain coziness,
warmth. You will be in the cold, alone.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are ready to be alone and in the cold, and ready to go in
darkness in search of light, religion is yours.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s4>4</span></p><p><br></p><p>Just drop the cross!</p><p><br></p><p>1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>RAJNEESHISM IS PURELY A RELIGION OF CELEBRATION, SO WHY ARE SO MANY
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AGAINST IT?</p><p>That’s why! All the religions of the world have been religions of
sado-masochism. They have created a miserable world. Their whole
strategy is to make you convinced that this life is a life of sin. You
have been made to feel guilty for just being alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The biblical story will help you to understand. Adam and Eve are
expelled from paradise because of a simple enquiry. And the enquiry was
also initiated by the so-called God – or Godot. He told Adam and Eve not
to eat the fruit of two trees: one, the tree of knowledge; the other,
the tree of eternal life. One can see what kind of God this must have
been.</p><p><br></p><p>To deprive man of wisdom, to prohibit him from tasting the beauties
of eternal life, is simply ugly, inhuman – I will not call it even
devilish, but it is really the devil that you have been told is God. If
He were really a creator of the universe and consciousness, He would
have been the first person to tell Adam and Eve to taste wisdom and to
taste eternal life. He was not religious at all. You cannot find a more
irreligious person than the Christian God.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is nothing but a science to attain wisdom, understanding, to
know what life is, and to live it in utter celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can live life in celebration only if you know there is no
death. If you know that it is going to be eternal, that there is no
beginning and no end, only then can you live without misery. God
prohibited man from both. Without wisdom you cannot attain to religious
ecstasy, and without the feeling of eternal life you cannot sing and you
cannot dance.</p><p><br></p><p>When death is there every moment, and any moment you can be taken
away.… They say, “Never ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”
You cannot be certain about the next moment. How can you enjoy, when
death is so close and follows you like a shadow?</p><p>This idiot, God, prohibits man from only two trees. And they lived in
the Garden of Eden where millions of trees must have existed. He is not
even as intelligent as Sigmund Freud, who is not very intelligent
either. Just average intelligence is needed to know that to prohibit
anything is dangerous; it gives a challenge to the mind. It is not the
serpent who convinced Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge, it is God
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>By pointing out these two trees, God makes it certain that these
people sooner or later will be attracted towards them. If He had not
mentioned them, I don’t think even up to now we would have been able to
find those two trees in the immense garden of paradise. And if it was
the serpent who convinced Eve, he is the first revolutionary, the first
man who feels and who knows what has to be done. He is the most
intelligent being in your whole BIBLE – the serpent – because he was
showing the way of understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of your misery is caused by your misunderstanding, your
ignorance, your unintelligence. Most of the misery is caused because you
are continuously afraid of death – and it is there walking by your side.
If these two things can be removed, celebration will come on its
own.</p><p>If you could be aware that there is no death, wouldn’t you love to
sing like birds in the morning? Wouldn’t you love to dance like the
peacocks of my garden? If you start understanding human problems, you
cannot be miserable. I have not been miserable for so long that I cannot
conceive how you go on maintaining misery, you go on nourishing it. You
are really strange people. What are the causes of your misery?</p><p><br></p><p>You look at a beautiful woman. Naturally you are attracted, but your
wife is by your side continuously watching you. She is miserable,
because how can she enjoy life when she is continuously suspicious of
you? You are miserable because this wretched wife is always there. You
cannot even have a glimpse of a beautiful woman, you have to avoid
seeing her. But a little understanding will dispel the whole thing.</p><p>It is natural, anything beautiful has to be appreciated. You have to
show your wife, “Look! What a beautiful woman.” And if there is
understanding, the woman will understand it; there will be no jealousy,
there will be no quarrel. It is human to taste different joys of life.
You cannot eat the same food every day. How can you enjoy the same man
or woman every day? It is asking for the impossible. Misery is bound to
happen. You will become a hypocrite.</p><p><br></p><p>It is perfectly human once in a while to have a different dish. And
if people are understanding... your wife will understand if once in a
while you go with another woman; her love will be great enough to allow
you that freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Love always allows freedom. Understanding means freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And if your wife goes to some man one day, just for the weekend, you
will not feel offended. After the weekend you will both be enriched. You
will find your wife again, your wife will find you again. Those first
days of love, those days of honeymoon will be back. And when you see
that the other gives you so much freedom and so much understanding, you
respect them, you feel grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>But all the religions have been prohibiting you from everything
natural; obviously, they have made you miserable.</p><p>Your whole education system tries to create ambition in you – not
understanding. Your education pushes you to become the governor, the
premier, the president, whatsoever the cost. The politician cannot be
happy – in spite of Jimmy Carter’s phony smile. Have you seen him
smiling after he was no longer president? When he was president I think
he did nothing other than show his teeth to the whole world. I have
heard that his wife used to close his mouth every night.</p><p><br></p><p>All lies – everything phony and American... all plastic. You know the
phrase, “the white lie.” Perhaps that’s why you call your president’s
house the White House. It is a very suitable name, because only white
lies exist there.</p><p>Man is living unnaturally. If he lives naturally then he feels
guilty, because his religion, his education, his culture go on and on
conditioning him: “You have to go above nature.” Who can go above
nature? Nature is all! – there is nothing above it. You have to be
natural.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what my basic teaching is: be natural. Don’t try to go beyond
nature. That is the beginning of misery, pain. And when you are
miserable, when you are in pain, you cannot tolerate anybody who is
celebrating. It hurts, it humiliates you.</p><p><br></p><p>My people are humiliating all the religions of the world. Naturally
they are against me and against you. It is your celebration that is
creating the trouble. Have long, British faces. Tears are accepted, not
smiles.</p><p>Have you seen Jesus Christ, in any picture, smiling? And Christianity
has chosen as its symbol, the cross. Now, the people who are carrying
the cross, can they celebrate? A cross is hanging on your neck – it may
be a golden cross, but a cross is a cross. All Christians worshipping
the cross are managing to remain miserable. They don’t love Jesus
Christ, they love his being crucified. Remember, Christianity was not
born out of Jesus Christ’s sayings – there is nothing much in them. You
cannot make a religion out of them. The whole of Jesus Christ’s doctrine
can be condensed on a postcard.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity was not born out of Jesus’ teachings, it was born out of
his crucifixion. Why was the cross accepted so easily? – and
Christianity is now the biggest religion in the world. It suited man. It
helped man in a very dangerous way. It made you aware that your misery
is nothing compared to the misery of Jesus Christ. You are carrying a
very small cross around your neck; Jesus had to carry a very heavy cross
on his shoulders. Three times he fell on the road because of the weight
of the cross. He was whipped and told to take up the cross again.</p><p><br></p><p>The crucified Jesus is your religion. Compared to your misery, his
misery is immense. Naturally, Christianity became the biggest religion
in the world, because it is the biggest philosophy of being
miserable.</p><p>Jesus said, “Carry you cross on your shoulders. Everybody has to
carry his cross on his shoulders.” I don’t see any point in it. Why
carry a cross on your shoulder? Are you mad? Rather, carry a flute with
you, a song, a beautiful flower – a rose I can understand. But then you
will be hated by all those who have missed the joys of life. But nobody
else is responsible for their missing, they themselves are
responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor.” This is sheer nonsense. Wretched
are the poor. But it gives solace to the millions of poor people of the
world. Jesus says that those who are poor here will be able to inherit
the kingdom of God. I do not understand the arithmetic. If they are
going to inherit the kingdom of God, why should they be poor here? Why
can’t they inherit it here, now?</p><p><br></p><p>I say to you: the kingdom of God is yours herenow, this very moment.
Just drop the cross. My religion is very simple: drop the cross. You
have carried it long enough, for thousands of lives; it has almost
become part of you.</p><p>So when you see someone dancing and you are crippled – crippled
because of your cross, you are dying under its burden, and somebody is
playing on his flute – you cannot forgive this man. He makes you aware
that you have missed the train, that you are a fool. Nobody wants to
accept himself as a fool – except a wise man.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you accept that you are behaving foolishly, the change
starts beginning. It is your responsibility. I have never seen any
miserable man for whom anybody else was responsible. It is your
conditioning.</p><p>Jesus says, “The camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not
a rich man.” The animals, the camels, are going to inherit the kingdom
of God, remember; they will pass through the needle. But a rich man
cannot pass through the gates of God. They have taught you to remain
poor, they have given you all incentives to remain poor.</p><p>My religion is a religion of richness.</p><p><br></p><p>Why wait for tomorrow? Why wait for a lifetime, in which you cannot
be certain of inheriting the kingdom of God after death, and for that,
suffer your whole life here? I say to you, forget God and forget the
kingdom of God. I give you here and now! Just be ready to drop your
conditionings. You are not handicapped, you are not crippled. Every
child is born a joy, a celebration, a dance, a song; but somewhere he
loses it all. That’s why all the poets of all the languages go on
remembering how beautiful it was to be a child.</p><p><br></p><p>What was beautiful in being a child? I cannot say that, because I
have been becoming more and more blissful; childhood was just the
beginning. If an old man says that his childhood was paradise, that
means his whole life has been a hell. He has not been growing up, he is
going down. Just to grow old is not growing up.</p><p><br></p><p>Growing up is a totally different phenomenon. It means the last
moment on the earth for you will be the most precious moment. The
departure from this life will be the climax of your joy. Childhood is
only a beginning.</p><p>But the religions start distorting the children from the beginning.
They create guilt in them, they create unnatural ideals in them. They
create their conscience in such a way that they cannot live happily
ever. On every point they are at a crossroad, and they will choose the
road that suits their conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians say you have been punished because Adam and Eve disobeyed
God. It is impossible for me to conceive that Adam and Eve’s
disobedience is still keeping you miserable. And what had they done? It
was sheer curiosity. And they did well. Instead of worshipping God and
Jesus Christ in your churches, worship the serpent. Adam and Eve, they
are the right people; they disobeyed. It was needed; otherwise there
would have been no humanity. There would have been no Albert Einstein,
no Bertrand Russell, no Gautam Buddha. There was no possibility. You
would have been still animals, naked in the Garden of Eden.</p><p><br></p><p>And God immediately drove them out of the garden. I sometimes wonder
what model of car he used to drive them out. It must have been a Ford,
because “blessed are the poor.” And strange: four-wheelers, Fords, are
going in and out of God’s garden, his gate, but a rich man cannot enter.
Ford himself cannot enter.</p><p>If you teach people to be poor, and you bribe them to remain poor.…
And the bribe is bogus – it is</p><p>after death that you will have all the pleasure of life<span class=s6></span>But if in God’s garden all the pleasures of life</p><p>are available, one thing is certain, that pleasures are not
condemned.</p><p>If you look at the Mohammedan concept of paradise – your word
“paradise” comes from a Mohammedan word, firdaus – all kinds of
pleasures are available. Beautiful women stuck at the age of sixteen for
eternity, they don’t grow up; rivers of wine – bottles are not enough
Drink, swim,</p><p>have a deep plunge into the wine; enjoy it as much as you can – and
all free. This is the arrangement for the religious people.</p><p>But I cannot see how the contradiction can be resolved. Here wine is
a sin. Here, to have many beautiful women is a sin, and there it becomes
a virtue. Virtues are rewarded by sins – strange logic! But it was
needed to keep the poor, poor.</p><p>In India I have never seen a single rich man converting to
Christianity. I have seen only poor, starving, orphans being converted
to Christianity. Christianity thrives on poverty, because only the poor
need the consolation. Only the poor need motivation to drag their life
up to the grave – beyond the grave everything is just as it should
be.</p><p>When I say celebrate – because this life is a gift of existence to
you You have not asked for it, you</p><p>have not paid for it. You, in fact, don’t deserve it. Still,
existence is overflowing towards you, sharing all its joys. But you turn
out to be such an idiot that when the sun is rising and the sky is full
of colors – a time to dance, to sing – you are sitting in a dark church,
gloomy, before a cross.</p><p><br></p><p>My people worship, but not in a church.</p><p><br></p><p>They worship the beauty of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>A bird flying, a cloud wandering in the sky, the moon, the stars...
Outside you can see the whole existence is in celebration, but you have
closed your eyes to it. With closed eyes you are saying, “Ave Maria, Ave
Maria,” and you go on saying it.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, all the religions are against me because I teach celebration,
because I teach joy, because I teach comfort, I teach luxury, I teach
richness.</p><p><br></p><p>And man has the intelligence to make the whole world so luxurious
that even if there are saints in heaven, they will start praying to go
back to the earth. I cannot see that the saints in heaven can enjoy
beautiful women, because they missed here, and this is a rehearsal, just
a training period of seventy years. If for seventy years you have been
repressing yourself, just by entering into heaven, what will you do with
your repression? What will you do with your guilt?</p><p><br></p><p>THE BIBLE was written two thousand years ago; otherwise, marijuana,
LSD, hashish – everything would have been made available to the saints
in paradise. Of course, here it is a crime and would have remained a
crime, but for saints you have to be lenient: they have suffered so
much; you have to compensate.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t tell you about tomorrow, I tell you only of this moment. And
if you can enjoy this moment, the next moment you will be more capable
of enjoying. If tomorrow ever comes, you will be ready to dance, to
love.</p><p>These religions are bound to be against me, because they are not
religions. I want it to be emphasized that this is the only religion.
All those religions of the past were sick, pathological. If you start
thinking about them, you can easily see that they were pathological.
They have made the whole world sick, and they are still going on doing
it. They call it “service to humanity.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mother Teresa wrote a letter to me. Because I criticized her a few
years ago, she wrote a letter to me: “I cannot understand your
criticism. Service to humanity is the true religion. Don’t you agree
with it?” I wrote to her, “Yes, I agree. Tell all six hundred million
Catholics to commit suicide. That will be a service to humanity.”</p><p><br></p><p>The world is suffering from overpopulation – Christians should start
committing suicide and serve humanity. But they go on doing just the
opposite; they go on opening hospitals, they go on saving orphans. They
are against birth control, they are against abortion. This is service to
humanity? Nothing can be more poisonous to humanity than what Mother
Teresa is doing.</p><p><br></p><p>In her letter she asked me, “Are you infallible? I believe in the
infallible Jesus Christ.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not such a fool as to be infallible. I am an ordinary man just
like you. I am very much fallible. One of my Indian sannyasins is here –
his name is Falibhai. Whenever I see him I think to change his name to
“Fallible-bhai.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is claiming that he is infallible – and he cannot see that
Judas is going to betray him. He cannot see that going to Jerusalem
during that religious festival is going to death. Only on the cross does
he wake up; and he shouts at God, “Have you forsaken me?” But the skies
remain silent.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence is so beautiful. It is good that the sky does not answer your
prayers; otherwise there would be so much noise around the world. And it
would be difficult – what answer is given to whom? The sky remained
silent.</p><p>Jesus asks for water because he is thirsty, it is a hot day. And you
call this man infallible? He should just have carried a thermos. If he
can carry the cross, why can’t he carry a small thermos? When you go for
a holiday – and he’s going forever – a thermos is exactly the right
thing to take.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is infallible, and the popes are infallible because they
represent Jesus. This is a good arrangement: God is infallible,
naturally his son is going to be infallible – and then you can conclude
the son’s representatives are going to be infallible.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the last popes before this pope the Polack was homosexual. It
was a known fact. In fact, when he became the pope his boyfriend
followed him into the Vatican. He became his secretary. Secretaries are
very good – girlfriend or boyfriend, it does not matter, but secretaries
are very good. Do you think this homosexual is infallible? Do you think
this pope the Polack is infallible?</p><p><br></p><p>Just now he has been trying to convince the Jews that Christians are
not anti-semitic. Why? For two thousand years they have been
anti-semitic, for two thousand years they have been killing Jews. Has
God changed his mind? But infallible people don’t change their mind,
only fallible people change their mind.</p><p>Why is he trying now? His effort is to call a conference of Jewish
rabbis and Christian bishops, just to meet together and settle the
thing: “We are not enemies.” He has been telling bishops, “Don’t say
anything against Judaism.” That can mean only one thing: that all the
popes that have preceded him were fallible. Or, if they were infallible,
then this Polack is fallible.</p><p>I am not infallible. In fact, life is a continuous change. And the
conscious person goes on moving and changing with life and existence. He
is like a river, moving – not like a dirty pond which only goes on
becoming more and more muddy; he goes nowhere, he never changes. A river
goes on flowing, changing, taking new routes.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciousness keeps pace with the change of life and existence.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many questions which remind me, “In 1972 you said this<span class=s6></span>” Forget all about it! What I am</p><p>saying now is the truth – only for now, not for tomorrow. I will see
tomorrow what is the truth. I am not a blind man. I see, and I see the
existence continuously changing. But these bibles don’t change, these
korans don’t change, these gitas don’t change – they are dead books,
just rubbish. These old religions don’t change; they go on clinging to
the past which exists no more.</p><p>Galileo was called by the pope because he wrote that the earth is
round, not flat. THE BIBLE says it is flat. Of course, I cannot condemn
THE BIBLE; it looks flat to us too. Our vision is not that vast; we
cannot see the whole earth, we see only small fragments, which look
flat.</p><p><br></p><p>When Galileo wrote that the earth is round, that it is a globe, he
was forced by the pope: “You have to change it, because THE BIBLE cannot
be wrong. And we cannot allow one thing to be wrong, because that will
create suspicion; then other things maybe are also not right. If one
thing can be wrong, then everything can be wrong. THE BIBLE has to be
true word for word, as a whole.”</p><p><br></p><p>Galileo must have been a man with a tremendous sense of humor. He
said, “I will write whatsoever you say. If you say the world, the earth
is flat, I will write it.” And he wrote it, “The earth is flat – but
forgive me, this is my statement; as far as the earth is concerned it is
a globe. I cannot do anything about it. I can change my statement, but
what can I do with the earth? How can I make it flat to be consistent
with THE BIBLE?”</p><p>1972? Don’t even ask me about what I said yesterday. It is gone. What
I am saying this moment is truth. And if tomorrow I see changes, I am
not stubborn and I am not a fanatic, I will change; hence you will find
thousands of contradictions in me. Anybody who is aware will have
thousands of contradictions in his statements. Only a fanatic is
consistent, he never contradicts himself. He keeps his eyes closed, he
is afraid to see the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Celebration is the very nature of existence.</p><p>Don’t separate yourself from existence; otherwise, you will be
miserable. You cannot be nourished, you cannot eat THE BIBLE and the
KORAN and the GITA. They will not nourish your body, they will kill you.
If they cannot nourish even your body, how can they nourish your
consciousness?</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one nourishment: your roots have to be deep down in
existence. There is no other nourishment. And if you are nourished... I
say, “Blessed are the nourished. Blessed are those whose roots go deep
into existence. They are the richest people.” Richness does not mean
only money. I am not against money; it is a perfectly good servant for
exchanging things. But money alone is not richness.</p><p><br></p><p>Richness is multidimensional. It happens when you are in tune with
nature, in harmony with nature; it starts happening multidimensionally.
You may not be aware of what will happen to you if you destroy your
conditionings of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and simply rely on
and trust in nature. If your consciousness also trusts nature just the
way your body remains trusting towards nature.…</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know what treasures you have got. Once there is nourishment
you will start blossoming. You may not know that you can become a
painter, you may not know you can become a dancer. You may be a Picasso,
you may be a Nijinsky, you may be a Van Gogh, you may be a Rutherford.
You don’t know who you are. You will know only when you blossom; there
is no other way to know. And blossoming happens only in harmony with
nature. Your roots should go not towards any church, not towards any
scripture, not towards any dead prophets, but towards the nature that is
available to you.</p><p>Just be natural. Drop all sense of guilt. The guilt arises only
because your conditioning says, “Don’t do this” and your nature is
hungry to do it. Now you are split. Your religion, your Jesuses, your
Mohammeds say, “Don’t do this, this is wrong.” Those Ten Commandments,
three thousand years old – they are still dominating you. Why are you
degrading yourself? Those ten Commandments say, “Don’t do this, this is
sin. You will suffer in hell” – and your whole nature wants to do
it.</p><p>Listen to your nature, not to your conditionings, and celebration
will happen on its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen any tree miserable? Have you seen any bird miserable?
They are in harmony. Fortunately they don’t have priests, popes,
shankaracharyas, imams. If the trees had popes and</p><p><br></p><p>imams and shankaracharyas, then all the trees would stop flowering,
would not come to fruition. They would somehow survive – only survive.
Survival is not life! Survival is the minimum. You have to be
overflowing, you have to be so full that you can share, and still your
fullness remains full. That’s what the meaning of celebration is.</p><p>But the religions are bound to be against me, because if I am heard,
then there is no need for any other religion in the world. They are
trying to stop my words from reaching you; otherwise, there is no hope
for themselves. And they have a great investment.</p><p>In Russia I have my sannyasins – of course, underground. But I am not
a serious man; only fanatics are serious. When Russian sannyasins asked
me what to do about the red clothes, the mala, I said, “Forget all about
them – they don’t matter. They are just to provoke people.” But there
sannyasins will be killed, so they have to meet in basements. Still the
Russian government has started torturing them. They have taken their
books, they have taken their tapes that they had smuggled from the
outside. And they are torturing them to make them give the names of
other sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does communism fear us? – because communism is also a religion.
It has its own trinity: Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, V.I. Lenin – the
trinity. They also have their bible: DAS KAPITAL. Neither Christians
read THE BIBLE nor do communists read DAS KAPITAL. I am the only
unfortunate one who has been reading all this rubbish. Communism is an
atheist religion.</p><p><br></p><p>All these people are going to stop my words from reaching people.
That’s what is happening here.</p><p><br></p><p>I was tremendously disappointed when I came to America. I had thought
that it was a democratic country. It is not, absolutely not, because
what they have been doing to my people, to me, is fascist. Democracy is
just a mask; behind the democracy everything is fascist.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that one of my sannyasins, one of my
oldest sannyasins, Ma Yoga Laxmi, who was the president of the Indian
section of my sannyasins for almost ten years, and has been with me
almost for twenty years.… She is frail, small-bodied... she has cancer.
She has been operated on, much of her stomach has been removed. Still,
in America – remember I am saying in America, not in the Soviet Union –
she has been beaten by your naturalization services. She was not allowed
to have her legal expert, she was not allowed to phone anybody. She was
not allowed – because other sannyasins were waiting outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The officials took her first into the front part of the building.
They were very sweet – just the way communists are in Russia. They tried
to bribe her. They said to her, “We will give you a green card without
any difficulty, we will help you in every way. And if you help us and
whatsoever we say you support, we will replace Osho’s secretary and put
you in power.”</p><p><br></p><p>When she refused, when she said, “Whatsoever you are saying is
absolute lies, and I am not power- hungry,” when they found that she
could not be seduced in a friendly way, they forced her – four strong
people for a tiny person, fragile, the body is dying – and they took her
to the back. She told them, “Please, let me have my advocate with me.”
They did not allow it. And at the back of the building they started
beating her – of course in such a way that no medical evidence can be
found. And she is so weak.…</p><p><br></p><p>You call this democracy?</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins – the president of the international sannyas movement,
the president of this commune, the head of another corporation – all
these three women, and I don’t know about others, whenever they come
into the country or go out of the country officials take them into a
dirty room, force them to be naked, and force their fingers into their
vaginas under the pretext that they are searching for drugs. This you
call democracy?</p><p>And doing it to three women Perhaps they have done it to many. Those
poor women cannot say</p><p>anything, just out of shame: what to say to anybody? And there is no
witness; those officials will deny it flatly. These women are tortured
in an ugly, inhuman way – and this is a democratic country. Sometimes I
think the attorney general of Oregon must be the reincarnation of
Pontius Pilate.</p><p>This is also humiliation of womankind. Not only should sannyasins
fight it, all the women of America should fight it. This is simply
against every woman; it is not a question only of my sannyasins. But
other women will remain silent because they are Christians, they are
Protestants, they are Catholics, they are Jews. People cannot see
because they have so many curtains before their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, religions are against me – it is natural. I am also against all
of them. And remember, if Jesus could work with only twelve disciples
and managed to have the biggest religion in the world, what about
me?</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM HAPPY THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING AGAIN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I’M SAD
TOO. CAN</p><p>YOU SAY WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>It is very simple. You are happy because I am speaking. You cannot
understand my silence. To understand silence you have to be silent, and
you are not. Hence you are happy that I am speaking again; you can
understand words.</p><p>The problem for you is that you are sad also. That is a little bit
complicated. You are sad because I may disturb you. I am a very
unreliable person. In these thirty years it has happened many times;
thousands of people have come to me, remained with me, and at a certain
point dropped out. If I were silent they would have been still with me.
I said something which they had never expected.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was speaking on Jesus, many Christians became sannyasins. Now
when I am speaking on Jesus, only those who have guts will remain with
me; otherwise they will betray me. That’s why you are sad. Knowing my
past, you know I don’t give you, like Christians do, any catechism which
remains fixed. I am continuously moving, and you may be afraid whether
you will be able to move any further.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying today is nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not going to be silent again either. I will go on saying
things, more and more dangerous, unto my last breath. Even if I lose all
the sannyasins, it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s8>5</span></p><p><br></p><p>Discontent: another name for inferiority complex</p><p><br></p><p>2 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DO YOU EVER GET SAD?</p><p><br></p><p>Really a tough question! Yes and no. Yes, I get sad for you and for
the world in which you are living. And you are not aware that you are
living in the midst of a vast madhouse. You are so fast asleep, you
don’t know what is being done to you, to others.</p><p><br></p><p>The politicians make me sad because they are the ugliest animals on
the earth – continuously lying to people, exploiting people, humiliating
people.</p><p>Before the last election in America, the governor of Oregon had a
secret meeting of all the top officials of his government. The attorney
general was there, Norma Paulus was there, and everybody who means
anything in the government. They did not allow the journalists inside
And still you go</p><p>on calling this a democratic country?</p><p><br></p><p>They were deciding about my people, but they did not allow any of my
people to be present there. And the governor came out and gave a press
conference in which he lied completely. What happened inside and what he
said outside are completely contradictory. In the press conference he
said, “Things are normal. There is no need to be afraid, everything is
in control. We are trying to calm down the Rajneeshees.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how he was trying to calm us down. He never came here,
he never sent a message to us, but he was calming us down. Does he think
he is a magician? And he said he was trying to keep the opposing people
from getting too hot.</p><p>Inside, everything was different. Now the confidential record of the
meeting has been found – he was thinking it had been burned. But in this
world impossible things also happen. Now we know what happened inside
the meeting; there was no question of calming anyone down, no question
of creating peace. On the contrary, they were deciding how much time it
would take their army to reach Rajneeshpuram to destroy it completely.
They had decided to put the army on alert so any moment, within three
hours, they could destroy my people.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, in a way it is calming us down. If you are not here, there
will be calm. It has been calm here in this place for many decades, but
that calmness was death. There was only one house, and there was only
one family to look after this big place. It is one hundred and
twenty-six square miles – three times bigger than New York. Of course it
was calm. There were no birds to sing, there were no trees to blossom.
It was a dead place; we made it alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Now birds have started coming. Nature has a tremendous harmony when
there are so many people loving, singing, dancing. Birds have started
coming to this place, flowers have started blossoming.</p><p>But it is not noisy, it is not “hot” in the governor’s sense. You
cannot find a cooler place in the whole world. Of course the sun is hot
– that is not our fault. But the place is cool, calm, there is no
disturbance. In these four years there has not been a single fight. But
they want to destroy this calmness. They would love to have a dead
place, the serenity of a cemetery.</p><p><br></p><p>There is serenity in a garden too. Do you think birds singing,
flowers moving in the air, disturb anything? They make the silence
deeper, meaningful. Silence in itself is meaningless unless it has the
potential for a song, unless it has something in it to blossom,
something to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meeting they decided that the army should be put on alert, and
the army was put on alert. And they were ready, in three hours, to
destroy this place, these people. Of course we would have died singing
and dancing. We would have made history.</p><p>But these people make me sad – and they are in power, and they go on
lying. Now what do you call it – is it not a conspiracy, to tell the
people that everything is normal? Then why is the army on alert? And
what crime have we committed that we have to be destroyed?</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day the information came to me that in California,
whenever there is a boxing match.… The University of California has been
researching it, and they have found that whenever there is a boxing
match in California, for a few days the murder rate goes thirteen
percent higher than normal. And this is the murder rate – it says
nothing about smaller fights, people wounded, rapes. Still boxing
continues to be legal.</p><p>This place, where nobody fights, is illegal. People come close only
to hug each other. This small and beautiful life is not to be wasted in
fighting. That’s why I say yes, sometimes it makes me sad.</p><p><br></p><p>When I look around the world... we are in exactly the same economic
situation as the world was in before the second world war. The American
dollar was going higher and higher, and all</p><p><br></p><p>other countries’ economies were falling apart. This is the kind of
atmosphere when war becomes</p><p>absolutely necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was in India the dollar was worth seven and a half rupees. Now
it is worth twenty rupees – three times higher. The same is the
situation in Germany, in England, in Holland – all over the world. The
same was the situation before the second world war. You cannot live in
an ocean of poverty, with economies failing, nations going bankrupt,
people all over the world dying and starving. Sooner or later this
euphoria of the American dollar will backfire; it will become an
absolute necessity to start the third world war to divert people’s
minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventy-five percent of every nation’s income goes for war
preparations. People are starving and dying – and you are creating
bombs. Bread is needed, not bombs. Can’t you see the insanity?</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t there a single nation which can declare, “We are going to stop
creating nuclear weapons at the risk of being defeated”? Anyway, a
country like England, which has lived for three hundred years in great
luxury, exploiting the whole world.… Now the empire has disappeared.
England is dark, dismal; there is no hope – and still they are putting
all their resources into creating nuclear weapons, knowing perfectly
well that they can never again be a world power. They cannot compete
with America or the Soviet Union, or even China.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are not going to be a world power – even with nuclear
weapons you will be defeated and destroyed – then what is the point of
creating those weapons? In fact it is such a beautiful situation that
you can dissolve all defense measures, you can stop having a defense
ministry. There is no need; you will be defeated anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>But what to say about England? Even India, which is dying, goes on
and on creating more and more war material. They are also after nuclear
weapons.</p><p>In the history of man there has never been such a beautiful moment,
when some courageous nation</p><p>can say, “There is no need for any defense. We are all human beings –
who is going to attack us?”</p><p>And do you see the cunningness? All these defense departments are not
really for defense, they are for attack. Adolf Hitler attacked the
world, but he had no department for attack. It was the defense
department that was attacking.</p><p><br></p><p>The world will be going more and more into darker spaces, ditches.
But nobody is ready to listen;</p><p>their minds are conditioned so deeply that they are almost deaf. They
hear, but they don’t listen.</p><p><br></p><p>I just heard that one clergyman from Europe is here. He loves me, he
has been coming to all the celebrations. But because I said something
about Mother Teresa, he became very upset. This makes me sad. Why did he
become so upset? Can’t he understand a simple thing? – that Mother
Teresa is helping poverty to increase in the world, and poverty
ultimately means war.</p><p><br></p><p>He said that his four girlfriends Strange, a clergyman having four
girlfriends? Even I cannot afford</p><p>that. And nobody is there to prevent me, I am my own master; I don’t
accept orders from anybody. Four girlfriends of his had been to Mother
Teresa, and they all said that she is a nice woman. So what? There are
millions of nice women, far nicer than Mother Teresa. And I have not
said that</p><p><br></p><p>she’s not nice. Why do you get upset? Yes, she is a nice old witch.
Now get upset. And pack your luggage and go back. Your love for me was
of no worth.</p><p>This makes me sad. In these thirty years thousands of people have
come along with me; they will go a few steps and then drop away. They
had the potential, they had the courage; otherwise even to go a few
steps with me towards the unknown is difficult. But after a few steps,
why did they drop out? Something I said disturbed them. But they are not
aware – it is not their consciousness which is disturbed, it is their
conditioning which gets upset, disturbed.</p><p>Are you going to listen to awareness or to all kinds of rubbish that
rabbis, bishops, popes, mothers and fathers have forced into your head
when you were very small and vulnerable?</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes feel puzzled: why do you call Mother Teresa “mother,” and
why do you call the pope “father”? Popa in Italian means father. Instead
of calling him pope start calling him popa – that sounds better. You
call the pope, who has no children, “father.” You call Mother Teresa,
who has no children, “mother.” Let these two get married. And put them
on the pill, because we don’t want their progeny. Enough is enough!</p><p>Existence does not make me sad. My own inner being for three decades
has never felt a single moment of sadness for myself. I have completely
forgotten the strategy, how to be sad. But what goes on happening around
the world just brings tears to my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This world is not worth saving. Once in a while I think it will be
better if the third world war happens and destroys this whole stupid
humanity. Perhaps there is a time when a thing gets so rotten that it is
better to burn it.</p><p>Consciousness is eternal. Even if this earth becomes without human
beings, I don’t see any problem in it. There are at least fifty thousand
planets around the earth where life exists. Your consciousnesses will
move to other planets. Nothing will be destroyed – only this ugly earth,
these ugly politicians, priests; they will be finished.</p><p><br></p><p>This makes me sad: man on the earth has the highest quality of
consciousness, and yet his behavior is barbarous. And everything that
you call civilization is just a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man asked George Bernard Shaw, “What do you think about
civilization?” He said, “It is a good thing, but it has not happened
yet.”</p><p>What the religions go on doing around the world makes me sad. They go
on making you more and more idiotic. Their basis is faith. They force
every child to be faithful, a believer, and if possible, to be a fanatic
believer. You will find all kinds of fanatics around. Even if you don’t
want to be delivered, you don’t want to be saved, they will force you to
be saved.</p><p><br></p><p>There are Christian sects who are self-appointed saviors. Who gives
you the authority to save another? And are you certain that you are
saved? Your face, your eyes do not give any proof of it; you look angry.
Even a nice man like Jesus was an angry man. Who gave him the authority
to beat the money-changers in the temple of Jerusalem and throw them
out? Self-appointed judges.…</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus wanted to save the world – he could not even save himself. And
he has left an ugly heritage which goes on growing like a cancerous
growth, destroying everything that can raise you to beauty, to truth, to
silence, to ecstasy.</p><p>I have never seen a Christian ecstatic. Even Jesus was not ecstatic;
he was burdened, and continuously having hallucinations. Now thinking
oneself the only begotten son of God – do you think the man was sane?
Thinking that he is the only real messenger bringing truth to humanity –
do you think this man is mentally healthy? He is utterly sick, and
Christians are sick.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not only the Christians; the Hindus are in the same boat,
the Mohammedans are in the same boat. Their names and their theologies
and their scriptures are different, but the basic madness is there. They
are all hallucinating.</p><p><br></p><p>Your religions are nothing but opium. Drugs are prohibited – and the
greatest drug is your religions. They should be abandoned, completely
abandoned, if we want man to get rid of hallucinations. Otherwise,
people are hallucinating that soon they will reach heaven and all the
angels will be there dancing and singing, “Alleluia!”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no heaven, and there are no angels. Heaven is a state of
consciousness. It is not a place. It is not part of geography; otherwise
there would be very much confusion. In India, if you ask the Hindus
where hell is, they say, “Just under us, deep down.” But if you make a
hole from India deep down, you may enter Oregon – and their heaven is
above. But the earth is round; everything is above, and everything from
some angle, some place, is below. The Hindu’s hell is your heaven, your
heaven is a Hindu’s hell.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on listening to these people, and you go on absorbing their
nonsense in you. It is sheer poison. The politicians, the priests, make
me sad. They are all programming your mind and changing it into a
computer, a mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>My work here is to deprogram you. Whether you get upset or not, I
don’t care. You will get upset, because deprogramming is upsetting. You
have believed a certain thing for fifty years, sixty years, and suddenly
I say that it is nonsense. You cannot accept it, because that means you
have been a stupid guy. But if you have guts and intelligence, there is
still time to get out of the rut.</p><p><br></p><p>I am, and my religion is, nothing but the science of deprogramming.
And remember, don’t get mixed up with the deprogrammers that exist in
California. They are not deprogrammers, they are REprogrammers. If any
Christian moves away from Christianity, his parents becomes paranoid;
they force the person to go to those so-called deprogrammers. They don’t
deprogram him, they reprogram him. He was escaping from Christianity,
they bring him back to Christianity. You call it deprogramming.…</p><p>Deprogramming means that you are simply left without any program. You
are left without any religion, you are left without any theology. You
are left alone to be yourself, an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on asking me, “How many followers do you have?” I have not
a single follower in the whole world, because my whole work is to
destroy following, followers, and to create courage in people so they
can stand on their own and be individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>It makes me sad that you are not individuals. Somebody is a
Christian, somebody is a Hindu, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a
Buddhist. You are not individuals. You are blind followers, programmed
by other blind followers.</p><p>But as far as I am concerned, there is no sadness in me. Day and
night, I am in absolute bliss. That also makes me sad, that what is
possible for me – an ordinary individual like me – why can’t it be
possible for all? I do not claim any speciality. I do not claim that I
am the only begotten son of God. I do not proclaim that I am the prophet
bringing a fresh message from God.</p><p><br></p><p>All these prophets, messengers, avataras, are just holy shit! Of
course, it has been clinging to you so long that when I start hitting
you hard so that this holy shit drops, you get upset.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand, but I cannot stand it! Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS STATEMENT BY J. P. MARKHAM: “I FEAR THE
CONTENTED MAN. I</p><p>FEAR HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROGRESS UNLESS THERE IS
DISCONTENT.”</p><p><br></p><p>I do not care whose statement this is. One thing I know, that
discontent certainly makes you speedy. You go on running your whole
life. You become just a vehicle that goes on moving faster and faster.
But for what? I do not call it progress.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have all the money of the world, still you will be running
after money. You may have all the knowledge, and still you will be
running after more knowledge. In every dimension there is infinite space
to run.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard A man and his wife were flying in a plane; the man was
piloting. The plane was going</p><p>full speed, and the wife asked, “Where are we going?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Don’t bother where – look at the speed! We are
certainly going SOMEWHERE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Discontent is another name for inferiority complex. Discontent means:
you look around, people have this, people have that, and you don’t have
it – you are discontented. But just seeing that somebody has it, you
becomes discontented, you start feeling inferior. You have to surpass
it, you have to get ahead. This continuous getting ahead is called
progress – it is not progress. And this kind of progress begins even
before your birth.</p><p>When a man makes love to a woman, the living cells that he releases
into the woman’s body start running. Progress begins there, because in a
single lovemaking millions of living cells are released. They must have
been feeling imprisoned in the man. Whenever they get the chance they go
fast – you cannot understand how fast, because they are so small you
cannot see them with your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The passage between them and the female egg, in proportion to their
size, is almost two miles. And their life is very short, they are almost
on their deathbed, because they can live for only two days, not</p><p><br></p><p>more than that. In those two days those tiny cells have to run two
miles, with millions of competitors, and only one will reach the female
egg.</p><p>Sometimes it happens, two reach at the same time – that’s why twins
are born. Once the female egg opens and receives a male cell, it closes,
and all those millions – those progressive people – simply die. If your
lovemaking is counted, you have been murdering millions of people your
whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t think that the celibate monks are not murdering. Their
cells die in imprisonment – at least you give them a little freedom, a
little democracy, a little chance to progress. The celibate monk,
Catholic or Hindu, does not allow those poor people to get out of his
body. Yoga has methods to go on preventing them from getting out of you.
They go on dying within you.… You are eating, you are getting
nourishment, and it is a natural process. The body goes on; the body
knows no religion.</p><p>The body goes on doing its function. It is programmed by nature, not
by any priest – it will go on creating new blood cells, it will go on
creating new semen cells, it will go on creating everything that the
body needs. But when new living semen cells are created, the old have to
die and vacate the place. The new ones have come – the new generation
has come and the old generation has to go. There is not much space for
all of them to coexist.</p><p>When you think of progress... it starts with your lovemaking – a mad
race – and where do you end? You end with a woman. Great, just
great!</p><p><br></p><p>And then your whole life it is the same, the same story. People are
running after power, people are running after money, people are running
after respectability. People are running after everything you can
imagine, and where do they end up? Even if you reach the last rung of
the ladder – there is no such thing, just for argument’s sake I am
saying it – even if you reach the last rung of the ladder, what will you
do then?</p><p>I remember I was driving and a dog started following my car, chasing
– he was hot, really progressive, very discontented. But he was not
acquainted with me. He must have chased other cars.…</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped the car – the poor dog was huffing, his tongue was hanging
out. I stopped the car and</p><p>asked the dog, “What now? What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the way the dog looked at me... Ronald Reagan would also look the
same way!</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you become the president of a country, or a prime minister of
a country, so what? You call it progress? It is obsession with
speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Discontent brings conflict because it brings competition. If you are
running, others are also running. There is going to be competition,
there is going to be cut-throat competition. Hence all these wars.</p><p>The Polack pope is reaching out to the Christians around the world
with the message, “Drop your antagonism with the Jews.” The Christians
cannot understand. For two thousand years they have been KILLING Jews.
When Adolf Hitler killed almost one million Jews in Germany, the high
priest of the Christians in Germany blessed him; he had done a great
religious act by removing these Jews.</p><p><br></p><p>For two thousand years Christians have been killing Jews because Jews
killed Jesus; and nobody bothers about the fact that Jesus was a Jew, he
was not a Christian – it is none of your business! If Jews want to kill
another Jew, it is their internal affair. Jesus never claimed that he
was a Christian. If he had claimed that he was a Christian, he would not
have been crucified – then, who bothers?</p><p>Jews were upset because he was saying he was their Lord, that he was
coming from God just as Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel and other prophets have
come. And in a way he is higher than all those prophets, because they
were only postmen, nothing much. He is the only begotten son. Naturally
this Jew was going to be killed by the Jews. But they killed a Jew, they
never killed a Christian. Christians have been killing Jews. I don’t see
the mathematics of it.</p><p>And how after two thousand years it happens in a Polack mind... and
it is known all over the world that anything like mind does not exist in
them, they are empty bottles of alcohol. If you are a cannibal and you
eat a Polack, you will know what I mean. Just a little taste of a Polack
and you will go unconscious!</p><p><br></p><p>This Polack popa is trying to create a bridge, a communication
between the Christians and the Jews. Why? These things are not
religious, these things are political. After the second world war they
created a Jewish nation, Israel. Jews think the Americans, the British
and other allies – who were all Christian – have done a great favor to
them; it is not so. It was a very cunning strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>Israel is the holy land of the Jews, and also the holy land of the
Christians. It was not in existence centuries ago – because the
population was Mohammedan; there was no Israel before 1945. There used
to be a nation, Palestine, which is no longer anywhere; it simply
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians could have taken possession of Israel, but they were aware
that if they took possession of Israel, then Jews would be against them
all over the world. And Israel is surrounded by Mohammedans, the whole
of the Middle East is Mohammedan; Israel itself is full of Mohammedans.
It would create a conflict, a war, a continuous war between Christians
on the one side and Jews and Mohammedans on the other side. In fact,
Mohammedanism is closer to Judaism than Christianity is; much of
Mohammedanism is borrowed from Judaism.</p><p><br></p><p>To avoid this situation of having Jews against them The politicians
could not do that, because if the</p><p>Jews are against the Christians, then who is going to donate to their
election funds? It would have been disastrous, particularly in America,
because all these politicians in America are supported by Jewish
money.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was in the hands of America, because American forces were
there in Israel to hand over the country to anybody – either to
Christians or to Mohammedans or to Jews. It was a Mohammedan country and
it would have been right to give it back to them. But Christians are
against Mohammedans for a very simple thing – that’s why I say this
whole world needs to be finished – a very small problem.</p><p>Mohammedans accept Jesus as a prophet of God but not as a son of God.
And they are very logical about it: where is the wife? There is nobody,
other than the holy ghost. And nobody knows about the holy ghost, to
what sex he belongs. Is he male? Certainly Christians cannot accept that
he is female, because to raise woman so high that she becomes part of
the trinity, the highest in</p><p><br></p><p>existence... the holy ghost has to be male. But that makes God a
homosexual, and homosexuals</p><p>don’t produce children. Then Jesus’ whole position becomes very
strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Mohammedans say Jesus is a prophet, a messenger of God, but not
a son of God; God has no relatives. This is the only difference. And
Christians and Mohammedans have been killing each other for fourteen
hundred years. These things should be laughed at, not fought for.</p><p><br></p><p>The Americans could not give it to Mohammedans, although the country
was Mohammedan, and it had been under the Mohammedans for a long time.
They could not keep it for themselves, because that would mean creating
two enemies: Jews and Mohammedans. They found a very political and
cunning way: they gave it to the Jews. In that way they created a bridge
between Jews and Christians, a friendship; they avoided one enemy, the
Jews, avoided the other enemy, the Mohammedans, and very cleverly put
the Jews in such a bad situation that they will continually have to
fight with the Mohammedans.</p><p>Nobody can see any end to it because the country is Mohammedan, it
belongs to the Mohammedans. It was forcibly taken and given to the Jews.
This gave a very good opportunity to American Christians to get more
donations from Jews; and it was a very good situation: they need not
kill Jews, Mohammedans will kill them. Can you see the strategy? – so
beautiful, so sophisticated.</p><p>Mohammedans will kill them – they have been killing them – on the one
hand; on the other hand, the Jews will remain dependent on Christian
countries. Israel is not independent; if America stops giving support to
them, they will be finished within minutes. They have to remain under
American control. Israel is nothing but a slave country of the
Christians. And it will have to remain a slave; otherwise Mohammedans
will kill it.</p><p><br></p><p>American politicians have done a good job. Jews think they have been
favored; that is nonsense. They have been put in such a fix that they
will never be out of it. And Christians have made a great step towards
absorbing them. That has been the desire of Christianity: to absorb the
whole world.</p><p>This hand of friendship is a not a hand of friendship. It is a hand
that wants to destroy you. Jews are in tremendous discontent,
Mohammedans are in tremendous discontent, Christians are in tremendous
discontent. Whoever has said that discontent is needed for progress?
Humanity has been in discontent for as far back as you can imagine. What
progress has happened?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you have better roads, you have better machines, you have high
technology – but you don’t have a better man. And your high technology,
your nuclear weapons, your so-called good roads, beautiful buildings –
without a good man they are just dangerous; not only useless, very
dangerous. It is giving a naked sword into the hands of a child. Man
remains retarded and he is being given nuclear weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard When Ronald Reagan became the president of America, he
was on a morning walk</p><p>on a beach with his favorite friend, a chimpanzee. Great progress is
happening: chimpanzees are friends of presidents! One man sitting there
on the beach was very much puzzled. He said, “Mr. President, sir, am I
hallucinating? What is this chimpanzee doing with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Reagan said, “You are not hallucinating, he is my friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I am not asking you, I am asking the president. Don’t
interfere.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the first world war, for the first time psychoanalysts were
employed by the governments to find out the intelligent quotient – I.Q.
– of the soldiers. And it was a shock: the average man’s mental age is
close to fourteen years. He may be seventy years old, but his mental age
is not more than fourteen – it may be less.</p><p><br></p><p>What progress has happened? You have not been able even to keep a
synchronicity between man’s physical age and his psychological age, and
you call your world a civilized world – where everybody is retarded?</p><p><br></p><p>But these retarded people are needed by the politicians, by the
priests, by all the vested interests, because if a man’s intelligence
also grows along with his body, then he will not become just old; he
will grow up. His old age will be a beautiful experience. He will be
able to drop all the conditionings which have been forced upon him.</p><p><br></p><p>But a retarded person cannot do that. He cannot even understand
anything higher. He cannot even understand Leonardo da Vinci, he cannot
understand Kalidasa, he cannot understand Rabindranath Tagore, he cannot
understand Lao Tzu. He can only understand third-rate newspapers – the
OREGONIAN. Yes, that he can understand.</p><p><br></p><p>He can follows a man like Reverend Jim Jones. Only a retarded man can
do that. It is not a surprise that Jim Jones’ followers were all black.
Of course, they are more retarded than the white people; they have lived
in slavery for so long, uneducated, humiliated – they are not
first-class citizens. They have not been treated as human beings.
Reverend Jim Jones had not a single white man as his follower. Those who
died, committed suicide in Jonestown, were retarded people.</p><p>A man of intelligence would like to love, to live, to laugh. A great
opportunity has been given by existence; he would like to drink out of
it to the fullest. He would like to squeeze all that life contains.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jim Jones convinced those fools to commit suicide. Of course
Christianity has the ultimate responsibility for it, because Reverend
Jim Jones was an ordained Christian priest. Of course the cross is the
symbol of suicide, and the whole teaching of Christianity is not for
living joyously.</p><p>If Jesus can convince retarded people in Judea that when he reaches
God, soon after they will all</p><p>follow him<span class=s6></span>He never defined how long this
“soon” is. Two thousand years have passed; the “soon” is still there.
Jim Jones carried the logic to its very end. He said, “Why should I wait
there and and you wait here? You die with me, so we all go together.” He
convinced those retarded people to commit suicide.</p><p>Retarded people can be convinced about anything. Retarded people are
being convinced to go to Vietnam to kill innocent people who have done
no wrong to them. They can be sent anywhere, can be convinced to do
anything.</p><p>Japan had suicidal soldiers – a separate division. They would take an
aeroplane full of bombs, and the pilot knew he was not going to come
back, but he was dying for his country. Only retarded people can be
convinced to die for a country. What is a country? Where is Palestine?
And for Palestine people have been dying. Countries exist only on the
map; the earth is one.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say Rajneeshpuram is not in America, not in Oregon. This
whole earth is ours. Rajneeshpuram is the capital of the whole
world.</p><p>We don’t believe in nations. It is idiotic – what is the need of all
these nations? Yes, a world government is needed, but not nations.
Unless we create a world government, wars will continue because these
nations will go on fighting – India with Pakistan, China with India –
the war will continue somewhere or other.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to stop war is not what the pacifists go on doing –
carrying posters in processions. There are a few people who enjoy it; it
is good exercise. And they are boiling because of discontent, so it is
good in a way to shout slogans; it releases something in them. But these
pacifists are not going to stop the war that is just on the horizon. Any
moment, any chimpanzee can trigger it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow is more uncertain than it has ever been. The next moment is
more uncertain than it has ever been.</p><p>Protest, protest marches, slogans – this is not going to help. These
people are exactly the same retarded people, they are just on a lower
rung of the ladder. I have been watching these pacifists and their
processions, their shouting and their slogans. It does not give the
sense of peace; these are warmongers. Perhaps they are ready to fight
for peace.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one way: nations should disappear, they are an
unnecessary burden on us. The world can easily be one, there is no need
of different colors on the map. If the world dissolves the nations, whom
are you going to fight? And if the world becomes a little more
intelligent and drops all religious nonsense, whom are you going to
fight? And if you are not going to fight, there will be no Ethiopia,
there will be no poor India – because all your energy, all your money,
all your resources that are going into war efforts will be freed. The
whole humanity can live richly.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask me, “What are you doing for Ethiopia?” Whatever I am
doing, I am not sending Ethiopia some bread, some butter – that is not
going to help. In the first place it is never going to reach Ethiopia,
it will reach the Christian missionaries. In the last year they
collected fifteen million dollars in America for Ethiopia. All has
disappeared, it never reached Ethiopia. The same has happened before;
Ethiopia has been in trouble for four years. In the name of humanity,
service, these missionaries collect the money and swallow it.</p><p><br></p><p>Last year when the fifteen million dollars simply disappeared, it was
enquired what had happened. The Christian missionaries said they did not
want to send the money to the Ethiopian government, so they found a
French agency to distribute the money, food, clothes, to the starving
Ethiopians. When the French agency was asked, they could not believe it;
they had never heard about these missionaries.</p><p>Ethiopia will be there, more Ethiopians will be there tomorrow. Small
efforts won’t help. I don’t</p><p>believe in throwing a spoonful of sugar into the ocean to make it
sweet. I am not retarded.</p><p><br></p><p>This Ethiopia, this India, the poor countries in the East, in Africa
– this is your doing! First you create the problem, and then you start
talking about serving humanity. Why create the problem in the first
place? Dissolve all the nations if you have any love for humanity. And
dissolve all the religions if you have any respect for civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>A civilized man cannot be a Christian, a Jew, a Mohammedan. He cannot
be an American, he cannot be an Indian. A civilized man is simply man.
And if wars disappear, the world will not need priests to persuade you
that “Blessed are the poor,” because there will be nobody who is poor.
Then the priests will not be able to distract your mind towards heaven,
because we can make heaven on this very earth.</p><p>If God has thrown out Adam and Eve, do tit for tat: throw him out. We
will make the Garden of Eden here! Let God beg to come in.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should you pray and beg that you should be accepted, when we can
create paradise here? But these politicians, these priests, go on
diverting your energies. They are diverting science towards war. Science
has now come to a point where it can make this earth so beautiful, so
comfortable, so lovable that there will be no Jonestown. Nobody will
want to commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a discovery of scientific research that man’s body has an inner
capacity to go on renewing itself – of course only for seventy, eighty
years, and in rich countries for a hundred years. But in some countries
even up to two hundred years the body remains young. We just have to put
our scientific intelligence in the service of life – up to now it has
been in the service of death. Man can live forever on this earth; there
is no need to search for an eternal home beyond death – that is just a
consolation for you.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you can be as blissful as they have been depicting people in
paradise, naturally you won’t take any interest in their bibles, in
their korans and gitas. You will not go to confess your sins, because
there is no sin.</p><p><br></p><p>People just need more understanding. People need more life, more
wisdom, more clarity. You don’t</p><p>need to be forgiven. You have not done any wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been doing only one thing wrong: you have been following
idiots. God, who does not exist, may forgive you. I cannot forgive you
for that.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s8>6</span></p><p><br></p><p>Contentment is a state of consciousness</p><p><br></p><p>3 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IF DISCONTENTMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO REAL PROGRESS, THEN IS THE
CONTENTED MAN THE ALTERNATIVE?</p><p>No. The religions of the world have tried to create the contented
man. The contented man is really the repressed man. He has all the
desires, all the ambitions, but he is repressing them. He is very
disturbed inside.</p><p><br></p><p>So I cannot say that the contented man is the alternative. I say
contentment is the alternative. Don’t</p><p>misunderstand me. The point is a little delicate.</p><p><br></p><p>Contentment is a state of consciousness. And when there is
contentment, there is no man, no</p><p>woman. There is no ego, there is no “I.” There is only
contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like when you are silent. Is there a silent man? No, there
is only silence. When you are in meditation, is there a meditator? No,
there is only meditation. You disappear, you have to disappear, because
you are discontent, you are disturbance. You are anguish, anxiety,
despair.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians say that there is only one sin God will not forgive, and
that is despair. Perhaps that is the only statement I can agree with –
not with the idea of God, but that despair cannot be forgiven. Despair
simply means all these things together: anxiety, anguish, discontent,
frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>Contentment is the answer. But the religions have been trying to
create a pseudo type of contentment. They tell you that if you are poor,
you are blessed; be contented with it: “God must have a design behind
it, and you will be rewarded soon.” If there is any reward in the
future, then your contentment is false. You are really suffering and
waiting for the reward.</p><p>All the religions have been giving you rewards – or punishments. If
you don’t listen to them, you will be punished; if you don’t follow
them, then you are bound to go to hell. And the Christian hell is the
worst, for the simple reason that you will be there for eternity. It is
so illogical, so absurd, that even an idiot can understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity believes in only one life – that means seventy years,
eighty years, a hundred years. In a hundred years can you commit so many
sins that the punishment will be for eternity, forever? Even Adolf
Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse-tung – all three combined cannot
manage to commit so many sins.</p><p><br></p><p>Bertrand Russell is right. He says, “If I count all my sins that I
have committed, and also count all the sins that I wanted to commit but
have not committed, even then, four or five years in hell would be
enough – more than enough.”</p><p>Do you know the psychological fact, that when you are in pain each
moment becomes longer? Have you been at the bedside of a dying man in
the night? It seems it is not going to end ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is a relative phenomenon; it changes with your psychology. In
pain, despair, anguish, it moves very slowly; in utter despair it seems
that the clocks have stopped. When you are happy, blissful, time moves
faster. Suddenly time appears to have wings. When you are with a friend,
hours pass, and it seems you have just met. When you are with your
lover, your beloved, then the night becomes very short. In fact, life
seems so small to a lover that seventy years look like seven days or
seven hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment in hell – Bertrand Russell is not aware of it – will be
an eternity unto itself, what to say about being in hell for eternity?
And what sins have you committed? Not many people are murderers, not
many people are thieves, dacoits.</p><p>What sins are you committing? Even to call them sins is wrong. They
are only mistakes – human, expected. Because you are not all-knowing,
mistakes are bound to happen. Because you are not omnipotent,
omniscient, omnipresent, mistakes are bound to happen. To err is human.
Anybody claiming infallibility is a criminal. Perhaps that is the only
sin that you can commit.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions have created a false contented man – false because the
man is trying to be contented, waiting for the rewards in heaven, in
paradise. He is repressing here. He knows this life is small, much has
passed, the remainder will also pass. He has become accustomed to its
pain, its suffering, its frustration, its poverty. And deep down there
is great hope that soon he will be in the blissful paradise – and
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever considered that any pleasure, any happiness, if it
continues forever, will not remain happiness anymore? Just think...
kissing your woman forever. You will curse God.</p><p><br></p><p>Change is beautiful, it keeps you moving. But the old religions are
against change, they preach permanent things. And there is nothing which
is permanent except change, because anything permanent becomes dead. If
you are permanently in heaven, heaven will turn into hell. The very idea
of permanence is non-existential.</p><p>Yes, the old religions have tried to create a contented man. It is a
strategy to keep the poor, poor, a strategy against any rebellion,
revolution. It is a strategy to keep the suffering, suffering; to find
explanations for why he is suffering. Adam and Eve disobeyed God –
that’s why you are suffering. Strange logic! You have never met Adam and
Eve, it is simply a myth. Have you met serpents giving sermons?</p><p>And disobedience is something very essential for every human being in
becoming an individual. Not disobedience for disobedience’s sake – but
when you see something irrational being imposed upon you, and you go on
obeying it, you are going against yourself. You are destroying your
humanity, you are murdering your individuality. You are becoming a
slave.</p><p><br></p><p>Obedience is beautiful if it is in harmony with you, with your
understanding, with nature. But disobedience is also beautiful. If man
had continued to disobey the politicians and the priests, we would have
been in a far more beautiful, peaceful, loving world. They don’t want
you to disobey. They don’t want you to rebel, because of their vested
interests. They want you to cling to the past, because that is the only
way to exploit you.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu priest goes on exploiting millions of Hindus in the name of
Krishna, in the name of Rama, who cannot be said even to be religious
people – there is no question of their being incarnations of God. They
have committed everything that is inhuman, ugly. And still Hindus go on
worshipping them, because the priest is the mediator between the
worshiper and the worshipped – nobody knows whom they are worshipping.
The priest knows! The priest pretends to know, and imposes the idea on
you that you don’t know, so whatever he says has to be obeyed.</p><p><br></p><p>In this twentieth century, in India, if rains are not coming, then
all over the country jagnas – fire worship – is arranged. Millions of
dollars are wasted to feed the brahmins, to pay their fees, because by
their ritual... which is absurd – throwing into the fire valuable food,
in a poor country which is starving, and repeating mantras from ten
thousand-year-old Vedas.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody understands what those mantras mean. Brahmins have been
insisting that they should not be written in any language other than the
original Sanskrit, because once they are translated you will laugh; they
are stupid. And they have no connection with rain. They cannot persuade
the clouds to come; there is no relationship at all.</p><p><br></p><p>There are mantras in the VEDAS<span class=s6></span>A brahmin is
praying to God, “This year let your clouds rain only</p><p>in my field, avoid the fields of my neighbors.” They are praying to
God, “My cows should give more milk, and the cow of my enemy should not
give any milk.” Great prayers! But in ancient Sanskrit, which is not
understood, which has never been used as a language by people People
have not</p><p>been allowed to use it. It has never been a living language; it has
been the monopoly of the priest.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of hundreds of jagnas, rituals, sometimes rains come, and they
say, “Look! The VEDAS are still significant, they are not outdated.
Existence still listens to the prayers.”</p><p><br></p><p>But out of hundreds of rituals, ninety percent of the time rains are
not going to happen. Then they are always ready to say that something
has gone wrong. Mantras have not been chanted as accurately, as exactly
as they should be. Brahmins have not been fed, have not been given their
fees. Something must have gone wrong in the ritual; God is not
happy.</p><p>I am reminded that when I was in Poona.… Poona has seen its glorious
days: ten thousand sannyasins were always there; all the hotels were
packed, business was great. Although they were all against me, they
never suspected that I am a very unreliable man. One day suddenly I left
Poona.</p><p>I live in the moment. I don’t care for the future. For me the present
is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I called my secretary and told her, “I want to leave this
ugly place – dirty, full of lousy people.” Naturally when I left, slowly
all the sannyasins left. Now Poona is in ruins.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by the Poona commune there was a five-star hotel, the Blue
Diamond. Before we reached Poona it was on sale because they were not
making money, they were losing. It was a beautiful, big building, but
only fifteen percent of the rooms were ever filled. They were not even
able to pay the servants, the manager. When we were there, the Blue
Diamond was overfull.</p><p><br></p><p>They had offered it to me, they were ready to sell it as cheap as
possible. But when sannyasins started coming, and we needed space and
enquired, “Are you still ready to sell it?” they said, “No, not at any
price.”</p><p><br></p><p>The owner of the hotel is one of the richest men in India, Kirloskar.
He was very much against me for a simple reason: his daughter is married
to Morarji Desai’s son, and my friendship with Morarji Desai seems to be
going on for many lives. I had to tell you this, otherwise you would not
have understood.</p><p>I have heard that Kirloskar himself arranged a vedic ritual – a
hundred brahmins for seven days, throwing wheat, rice, milk, butter,
into the fire and praying, “Bring Osho back to Poona.” But it is not
going to happen; there is no God who can order me to go to Poona. What I
have left behind, I have left behind. I go on breaking the bridges that
I pass. Once is enough-the world is vast. But Poona became a
world-famous name. Now all that glory has disappeared; no vedic ritual
can help it.</p><p><br></p><p>These religions go on giving you hope. Hope is the poison; it keeps
you dragging, waiting for the moment when the hope, the promise, will be
fulfilled.</p><p>Christians are waiting for Christ to come back. He said to them again
and again, “I will be coming soon on the clouds of glory, with a divine
body, for the salvation of all those who believe in me.” He has not
come, and I can say to you categorically: he is not going to come again.
What did you do to him when he was here? That experience is enough to
prevent him – because I know if he comes back, you will crucify him
again. But the hope.…</p><p>Hindus are hoping, because Krishna has promised – all these prophets
go on promising – Krishna has promised that whenever there is misery,
whenever there is irreligiousness in the world, whenever virtue
disappears, whenever things are not as they should be, “I will be
coming.” For five thousand</p><p><br></p><p>years everything has been wrong – but there is no sign of his coming
back. But Hindus still go on living in hope, still they go on repeating
the promise of Krishna, that soon he will be coming. This keeps people
unconscious of the reality. It is opium – very subtle, very
psychological.</p><p>The contented man has been created by this opium: here be contented,
and there you will be immensely rewarded for your contentment. Don’t be
bothered about the rich and the luxurious. It is just momentary; soon
the rich will be suffering in hell. Don’t be jealous of them and don’t
be competitive with them. Be contented.</p><p><br></p><p>India, perhaps, is the oldest country in the world; its religions are
certainly the most ancient religions. But in India not a single
revolution has happened, and it has been suffering for thousands of
years. Starvation, poverty, sickness – it has been living in a
nightmare, but with the opium of hope: that the Hindus are the
privileged people of God, and this is only a momentary life. The
suffering is just a test of your faith. Once you have passed through the
test, all the joys of heaven are yours.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I said I don’t want the contented man. That is false,
pseudo, sick, retarded, believing in lies.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach contentment. And the basic principle of contentment is to
drop your ego. Don’t think for a single moment, “To be or not to be.”
Just not to be is the rule. What have you gained by trying to be? Just
for a change try not to be, and you will be amazed. The moment you are
not, there is contentment, there is silence, there is beauty, there is
bliss.</p><p>Meditation is only a methodology to make you aware that your only
disease is your ego, and your only health is egolessness.</p><p>The discontented man is suffering from his ego. He is comparing his
ego with others. Somebody is more beautiful than you, somebody is
stronger than you. Somebody is richer than you, somebody is more
powerful than you. All around there are people who have something which
you don’t have. You have to complete against the whole world – by any
means, right or wrong, but you have to reach the top.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I think of Edmund Hillary standing on the highest mountain,
the Himalayan peak, Everest. There is not even space for two persons to
stand together. And whenever I think of it, I think of poor Edmund
Hillary. He must have looked silly. Now what to do? You have reached the
top of the world, but what now? Jump and commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you can attain, you will remain discontented.</p><p><br></p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte was not a very tall man, he was only five feet
five inches. But I don’t see any problem. I am five feet five inches. I
have tried to figure out why he was puzzled; I am not puzzled. Even if I
were seven feet, my feet would touch the ground. At five-five they still
touch the ground, so what is the problem? But Napoleon was very much
disturbed, because his soldiers were taller than him, his bodyguards
were taller than him. That was giving him a continuous feeling of
inferiority.</p><p>One day it happened, he was trying to put a nail in the wall to hang
a picture. His hand was not reaching to the right spot, and his
bodyguard said, “Sir, you need not bother about it, I can do it – I am
higher than you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte imprisoned that guard, and told him, “You used
wrong language. You are taller than me, but not higher than me!” That
poor guard had unconsciously used a word that touched a deep wound in
Bonaparte. Bonaparte had everything, but discontent was there.</p><p>There are ordinarily two types of people in the world: the
discontented and the repressed discontented. I need the third type of
man to evolve: the man who has no ego; hence, he cannot be
discontented.</p><p><br></p><p>Contentment is not something to be practiced. When discontent
disappears, you find contentment has always been your nature.</p><p>Do you think a small bush is discontented because just by the side of
it a tall cedar tree is standing, reaching to the stars? Do you think a
small rose bush is discontented? There is no discontent in nature
anywhere, except in the mind of man. It has been created by the
politicians, by the priests, by the educationalists. Every child is
being told to come first.</p><p><br></p><p>My father was a very simple man. He was not even aware – because he
had eleven children – who was in which class and where. If some visitor,
some guest asked him, he would have to call me and ask,</p><p><br></p><p>“In what class are you?” He never asked me, “Have you passed or
failed?”</p><p><br></p><p>When I came first in the whole university, I thought, “He will be
happy, I should inform him.” I told him, “I have come first in the whole
university.”</p><p>He said, “So what! That simply means your whole university is full of
stupid people; otherwise, how could you manage to come first?”</p><p>I said, “That seems to be right” – and I threw the gold medal given
to me by the university into the well.</p><p><br></p><p>My father said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am simply destroying the gold medal, because I don’t want
to be first amongst thousands of stupid people. I am perfectly okay as I
am.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But don’t burn your certificates. You will need them for
employment.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Okay. For employment I will need them, but the moment I
leave employment, the first thing I am</p><p>going to do is to burn them all” – and that’s what I did.</p><p>For nine years I was a lecturer in the university. Then one day I
left, because when I can share my silence, my ecstasy with millions of
people, why should I waste my time with a dozen students, teaching them
something which is of no use, something I am against?</p><p><br></p><p>I had to teach Aristotle, and I think Aristotle is one of the most
criminal minds in the whole of history. But I used to say that too. I
would teach Aristotle, and then I would say, “Now, what I feel about
Aristotle I have to say to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Aristotle created a logic of duality: yes and no, and there is
nothing in between; either something is or it is not. This is not
true.</p><p>Life is a rainbow... all the colors.</p><p><br></p><p>Between yes and no there are many stages.</p><p><br></p><p>Life cannot be divided and cut into two separate parts. Life is an
undivided rainbow – one color melting into another. Yes and no are two
ends of the same rainbow, two colors of the same rainbow. They are not
opposite to each other – that is Aristotelian logic – I say they are
complementary to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was a tedious job, first to teach Aristotle and then to
contradict him. And my students became confused. They complained to
the</p><p>vice-chancellor, “What are we going to do? This man is strange. He
teaches Immanuel Kant and contradicts him, he teaches Hegel and
contradicts him. How are we going to answer in our examinations?”</p><p>The vice-chancellor told me, “You are creating trouble for those poor
students.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not creating any trouble, I am simply giving them the
whole picture. Now they can</p><p>choose. To give them only one side just to avoid their confusion is
cheating.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was made a judge. The first case came before him; he
heard one side and started writing the judgment. The court clerk could
not believe his eyes. He whispered in Nasruddin’s ear, “What are you
doing? You have not even heard the other party.”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “I am not going to allow myself to be confused. Right
now I am perfectly clear. Why should I listen to the other party and be
confused?”</p><p><br></p><p>I told the vice-chancellor the story of Nasruddin. I said, “Do you
agree with Nasruddin?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are just impossible. Do whatever you want to do.” But I
could not manage to remain confined in a university when the whole
universe was available to me; soon I left. The first thing I did was, I
burned all my certificates.</p><p><br></p><p>I left Poona forever. Now they are praying for me. When I was there,
they were trying to throw me out. Now they know all the joy and the
dance and the beautiful people from all over the world no longer come
there; they are coming here.</p><p>Had you ever heard about Oregon before? It never existed. It has come
to life for the first time, and you have brought your joy, your
meditation, your contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins are contentment, not contented men. My sannyasins don’t
care about politics. I have sometimes out of necessity to force them.
Look at poor Krishna Deva. I had to persuade him to become mayor of
Rajneeshpuram. Somebody has to be mayor. If you find somebody not
dancing, looking sad, you have found K.D. Nobody is interested in
politics here, nobody is on a power trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Contentment is a state of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>And out of contentment comes real progress.</p><p><br></p><p>The discontented man has created the world – ugly, disgusting. This
is not progress. The repressed, so-called contented men – the monks of
all the religions – what progress have they brought to the world? Yes,
they have contributed something: homosexuality, lesbianism.</p><p>Homosexuality, lesbianism, are very religious matters, because when
you confine only men in a monastery, and you confine only women in a
nunnery, what are they going to do with their sexuality? – which is
natural, simple, not a sin. You are born out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything in existence is sex energy. Yes, it can be transformed, it
can be raised higher, but you cannot deny it. The contented man created
by the religions has denied it. But your denial will not make any
difference to your physiology, your chemistry, your hormones. Your body
is neither Christian, nor Hindu, nor Mohammedan. That’s why the same
medicine works for all; otherwise there would be a Mohammedan cancer,
and a Hindu cancer, and they would have different treatments for them.
Your body is part of existence, it is existential. And my philosophy is
pure existentialism.</p><p><br></p><p>Homosexuality and lesbianism were born in monasteries. This is their
contribution. AIDS is their contribution to the world – real progress!
Who had heard about AIDS before? A great invention! What have they
contributed to the world? Neither the discontented man nor the so-called
contented man have given progress. Progress is possible only out of
contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>Just for a moment think that there is no ego in you, that you are
simply nobody, and you will feel so clean, so pure. And out of that
cleanness, purity, you will start growing, growing to be what your
potential is. You may become a painter, you may become a musician, you
may become a poet. You may become anything – a scientist, a dancer – but
it will come naturally to you. When something grows naturally in you,
there is progress. And if the world can be rich with music.…</p><p>I say to my people, “Don’t listen to Jesus, who says everybody has to
carry his cross, no.” I say to you, “Everybody has to carry his guitar.”
Why carry a cross when guitars are available?</p><p><br></p><p>Just grow to your potentiality – not according to any discipline,
because then you will never be yourself; not according to any dogma,
because that is distracting you from yourself. Without any dogma,
without any religion... can’t you have a little courage just to be
yourself? Part of this vast universe, nobody special And you are in for
a great surprise.</p><p>Yes, there have been painters before: Picasso, Van Gogh, and hundreds
of others. But have you ever thought that the paintings of Picasso are
sick, insane? If you go on looking at a painting by Picasso,
continuously for one hour sitting before it, meditating over it, then
you will know what I mean. This is not a painting, it is a vomiting!
That man was crazy, he vomited.</p><p>Of course, if Picasso had been a contentment, a painting would have
grown; it would not have been insane and crazy. Looking at it, you would
have felt a serenity descending upon you. Watching it,</p><p><br></p><p>you would have felt peace surrounding you. But this is not possible
with Picasso’s paintings – he is a very discontented man.</p><p>This is not possible with George Bernard Shaw’s books. You cannot
find a bigger ego than George Bernard Shaw. He writes a play of fifty
pages and gives it a one hundred fifty page preface. Can you think this
man sane – a small play needs such a big introduction? Something is
wrong with the man.</p><p><br></p><p>When he got the Nobel prize, one day he remained silent, made no
comment. He was in the headlines of all the third-class newspapers of
the world. The second day, he rejected it; he said, “I don’t want to
receive the Nobel prize because it is far below me! Give it to some
amateur writer, a beginner. I have passed that stage long ago.” Again he
was in the headlines.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an insult to the Nobel prize committee, which is presided over
by the Norwegian king or queen. From all over the world, all the
royalty, all the significant, powerful, important celebrities, thousands
of telegrams poured in to Bernard Shaw, saying that this was an insult
to Norway, an insult to the king, an insult to the Nobel prize
committee.</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for two or three days, made a great fuss, and finally
agreed to accept it. And all these days he was in the headlines. He
accepted the Nobel prize – that was a great relief for all the royalty,
and all the presidents, and all the premiers. And the next moment he
donated it to a society; again he was news.</p><p>For almost two weeks he maintained himself as the most important news
in the world, because it was discovered that the society to which he had
donated the prize was his own society – he had named it the Fabian
Society – and he was the only man in the society. He was the president,
and he was the secretary, and he was the membership.</p><p>Again he was in the news. And when he was asked why he did it, he
said, “When you get a Nobel prize you get headlines for just one day. I
managed to have myself in the headlines all over the world for two
weeks. Nobody can beat me!” His ego was like a balloon which went on
getting bigger and bigger.</p><p>These people cannot create real art. Their art is going to be a
reflection of their mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Progress out of contentment will be totally different. Poetry will
arise in you, just like a rosebush grows. It will give flowers to the
world, and the fragrance – and without any claim for any reward, because
contentment is its own reward. What more can you want than to come to
fruition, to flowering? What can give you more blissfulness than just to
grow into your real potential?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not promise anything to you. I have no theology of hell or
heaven – those are all bogus, created by fools for other fools. In my
vision the very contentment is the reward, the very silence is the
reward, the very meditation is the reward.</p><p><br></p><p>And nobody can feel inferior to you. A contented man, if his
contentment is of the old pattern, is going to feel either inferior or
superior – which are not different, they are two sides of the same
coin.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.… Three Christian monks met on a crossroad. One of them
said, “I highly appreciate your monasteries, but our monastery is more
scholarly than your monasteries.” Remember the “more.”</p><p>The second one said, “That’s perhaps true, but my monastery is more
ascetic. I have every respect for your monasteries” – this is all
garbage, this respect, it is all phony – “but as far as ascetism is
concerned, as austerities are concerned, you come nowhere close to
us.”</p><p><br></p><p>The third one said, “I also have great respect for your scholarship,
for your austerities, but in humbleness we are the tops.”</p><p>“In humbleness, we are the tops”! I am not talking about this kind of
contented man. A real contentment will make you humble, but not the
tops. Humbleness will come naturally to you. A real contentment will
give you, without any effort, a respect for all that exists. It is not
etiquette, it is not British; you will simply respect. How can you
disrespect?</p><p><br></p><p>A tree, a bird on the wing, a cloud just floating, a river flowing to
the ocean, a child smiling; an old man with all the experience of life;
a child with all the freshness of life.…</p><p><br></p><p>Whom can you disrespect? How can you feel superior to anybody? Can
you feel superior to a rose? Can you feel superior to a bird on the
wing? How can you feel inferior to anybody? You have all the
contentment, all the serenity, all the silence. Where can that dark
wound – inferiority – exist in you? You are all light.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the man who can bring beauty to the world – songs of silence,
out of silence; really authentic poetry. This man will transform the
whole nature of science. Progress will not stop, but it will have a
different dimension to it.</p><p>Now the whole of science is devoted to destruction. Albert Einstein
cannot be forgiven; he was the man who wrote to President Roosevelt that
the atom bomb can be created, and that it is the only way to defeat the
fascist forces in the world. He repented his whole life, but that
repentance cannot restore Hiroshima. It cannot give life back to
thousands of children, women, men, trees, in Nagasaki, in Hiroshima.</p><p><br></p><p>Einstein was an unconscious scientist – it was out of discontent.
Basically he was a German, but unfortunately a Jew; he had to escape
from Germany. He was doing the same work for Adolf Hitler. If he had
remained in Germany, perhaps there would have been no Nagasaki, no
Hiroshima. There may have been London, New York, Washington, Moscow, but
not Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</p><p><br></p><p>Einstein escaped out of the fear that because he was a Jew he might
get into trouble. And as a revenge against Adolf Hitler, he wrote the
letter to President Roosevelt. He was not aware of what he was doing. He
created the atom bomb, and he awoke only when Nagasaki and Hiroshima
were finished. But it was too late.</p><p>I don’t teach you repentance. Christians teach you repentance –
naturally, because they don’t make you alert, aware, meditative,
contented. So out of your unconsciousness, out of your discontent, out
of your tense mind, out of your anxiety, you are going to do something
for which you will repent</p><p><br></p><p>later. But it is always too late! It may help you to feel less
guilty, but that does not change anything in existence; you have
committed a crime. And Albert Einstein understood it. Before his death
he was asked, “If there is another life after death, would you not like
to remain a physicist?”</p><p>He said, “No! I would rather be a plumber, but never again a
physicist.”</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of science will disappear. Out of peace, the whole
dimension will change. Progress will not stop, but progress will be for
the benefit of humanity, for the benefit of the whole existence. Science
is capable, if it is in the hands of contented, meditative people, of
feeding the whole earth abundantly, of creating everything that is
needed – not just for survival, because survival is not life. Life has
to be overflowing, it has to be luxurious. A rosebush just surviving
somehow is not going to give you roses.</p><p><br></p><p>The earth can become abundant with everything. Science just has to be
creative and not destructive. A contentment inside you will not allow
you to be destructive.</p><p>If all the scientists of the world simply revolt against the
politicians, the world will see a tremendous transformation. But there
are very few scientists who have guts, because their guts have been
destroyed by their educational system.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of Sakharov. He was given the Nobel prize because he
was the best physicist of his time. But he was a Russian. He was
director of the Academy of Sciences in Russia, the highest post for a
scientist – position, respect. The Russian government did not want him
to receive the Nobel prize because it comes from capitalist countries,
and in the Russian mind – particularly in the communist party and the
people who are in power there – it is a kind of bribe, in the name of a
prize.</p><p>They do the same on their own, so they know; they give the Lenin
prize in capitalist countries. And by giving the Lenin prize they are
bribing the person to reveal secrets. So they don’t want any Russian to
receive the Nobel prize, because that way he becomes sympathetic towards
capitalist countries.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakharov is really an individual. The whole communist programming has
not been able to destroy his spirit. He went against the Russian
government, knowing perfectly well what had happened before to those who
had not listened to the Russian government. Two other scientists had
been given Nobel prizes before Sakharov. They did not listen to the
government; they accepted the prize. They were not allowed to go out of
the country to receive it; on the contrary, they were imprisoned,
tortured – and Russia has really progressive ways of torturing.</p><p><br></p><p>For fifteen days those two scientists were kept awake. They were
given injections so they could not fall asleep. The mind is a very
delicate thing; if for two weeks continuously not a single moment of
sleep is allowed, the person starts losing his rationality, sensitivity.
After fifteen days he has lost all interest in science. After twenty-one
days he has lost interest in his family. After thirty days he has lost
all interest in himself; the mind is dismantled. And then he is brought
before a court. Of course, the court judges him to be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>First you make him mad, and then you bring him before a court! This
had happened to those two scientists, and because they were mad and
dangerous, they were both exiled in Siberia. Nobody knows what happened
to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakharov knew what he was doing: when he accepted the Nobel prize the
same would happen to him. And he accepted the Nobel prize, and the same
happened to him. He was immediately removed from his power and position.
His car was taken away.… A car is a great luxury in Soviet Russia,
because only very powerful people can have their own private vehicle.
Everybody else has to use the public system – buses, trains.</p><p>I am against communism, because if a person is deprived of his
private possessions, something of his individuality dies. His private
possessions are a kind of safety around him, that keep him alive as an
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakharov’s salary was cut, his car was removed, he was not allowed to
go out of Russia. And then finally he was sent to Siberia. He is still
alive. The best physicist of the world is simply rotting in Siberia! –
and nobody bothers about it.</p><p>Just this incident of Sakharov should have been enough for all the
scientists of the world – not only of Soviet Russia – to simply
disconnect themselves from their governments. And if the politicians are
so interested in fighting, they can have wrestling matches and you can
enjoy it. They can have boxing matches, and you can enjoy it. If those
fools insist on fighting, perfectly good. The Soviet prime minister
wrestles with Ronald Reagan – enjoy it, there is no harm. But these
people should not be given power to destroy the whole humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>My people cannot in any way create anything that will be harmful.
They can create only something which will be a joy to see. They have
created this small commune which has become a nightmare to the
politicians of America.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not doing anything except making this land, which has remained
barren for years, green again. We are dancing, singing, meditating,
farming, gardening. We are not doing any harm to anybody. Even deer
understand it, but the attorney general of Oregon cannot understand it.
You can see in the evening, deer moving on the road without any fear.
You go on honking your horn and the deer does not care. He knows these
people are not destructive.</p><p>My own peacocks in my garden make me come here late sometimes. They
will not move from the road, they will walk just ahead of me. When I go
back, they are all ready just in front of my porch, dancing. I have to
stop the car and wait till they decide to give way to me. They know
perfectly well nobody is going to harm them.</p><p><br></p><p>Deer have come, birds have come. Even the poor juniper has become a
rich tree. When I came here these junipers were just dying, somehow
managing at a survival level. The juniper is a very strong-willed tree.
Where nothing else can exist, the juniper can. But no birds to sing, no
people.…</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand: this existence is a cosmos, it is a deep
harmony. When people moved here, suddenly birds started coming, deer
started coming. Even junipers understood the presence of my people. They
are far greener, far thicker, far bigger than they were when I came
here.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a deep connectedness in life. You cannot live without trees,
trees cannot live without you. When you inhale, you need oxygen; when
you exhale, you exhale carbon dioxide. The tree does just the opposite:
when it inhales, it takes in carbon dioxide; when it exhales, it exhales
oxygen.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a harmonious whole. Everything is connected with everything
else. The smallest leaf of grass is connected to the farthest star, a
star you cannot see. Harming a small grass flower, you are harming the
whole existence, because nothing is separate.</p><p>Contentment brings you insight into this wholeness. And I call only
that man holy who understands this wholeness of everything. I call that
man holy who can understand that sex and silence are not separate, that
sex and meditation are not separate. Nothing is separate. Everything is
woven into everything else. All colors are mixing with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I have an idea – I’m just waiting for the right time. I would like my
sannyasins to wear rainbow clothes. But I have to wait a little and keep
you in red clothes for two reasons: one, to shock the fools outside; and
two, so that I can recognize you easily. But before I leave this world,
you will be in rainbow clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, AS I LISTEN TO YOU, IT SEEMS YOU ARE TRYING TO
BE A MARTYR. ARE YOU?</p><p>I am not even a Christian – why should I like to be a martyr? The
word looks beautiful, but the reality is that those who would like to be
martyrs are suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was suicidal; he was trying in every way to be crucified. He
was not even courageous enough just to shoot himself. Why unnecessarily
make other people responsible for your crucifixion? If Jesus had shot
himself, the Jews would have lived in peace without any trouble. But he
forced the Jews to do it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is to Sigmund Freud’s credit that he discovered a suicidal
instinct in man. It was always accepted that man has a deep lust for
life; he wants to live and live, and live forever. But in existence
nothing exists without its opposite. That was the discovery of Sigmund
Freud, and it is absolutely right – with the life instinct there is a
death instinct. There is not a single man on the earth who has not at
least once thought of committing suicide. From where does that idea
come?</p><p>But a man who is contented has all the bliss that is possible. Both
the instincts simply disappear. He has no desire to go on living; he has
no desire to destroy himself by his own hands or by other people’s. For
him this moment is all. Whatever happens in the next moment is
welcome.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no desire to be a martyr, but if somebody kills me, what can I
do? It will be absolutely their responsibility. As far as Jesus is
concerned, Jews are not absolutely responsible. Ninety percent of the
responsibility is Jesus’ himself. If Mansoor is killed by the
Mohammedans, even more – ninety- nine percent of the responsibility is
al-Hillaj Mansoor’s.</p><p>If Gandhi is shot, one hundred percent of the responsibility is his,
because before his death he is reported to have said many times, “Now I
don’t want to live. It will be a mercy if God takes me away from this
body, because I have become absolutely useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange To think in terms of use is ugly. Neither do you have to use
anybody – because to use</p><p>somebody is to exploit them – nor do you have to allow anybody to use
you. That is your birthright.</p><p><br></p><p>Gandhi wanted to die, and he was praying for death. That makes one
thing very clear. When Nathuram Godse shot him.… It is good that
Nathuram has “Ram” in his name: Ram was Gandhi’s God.</p><p><br></p><p>Nathu is meaningless. In India, if a couple finds that their children
die and don’t survive, then something has to be done. So when a new
child is born, either his nose is pierced – a hole is made so a ring of
gold can be put through – or his ears are pierced and rings of gold are
put in. Nathu means nose, so if the nose is pierced, Ram becomes
nathuram. If the ears are pierced, Ram becomes kunchiberam – kun means
ears.</p><p>In fact he was just a”Ram” with a pierced nose – Gandhi’s God. And
when Gandhi was shot, he put his hands together, looking at Nathuram
Godse, and the words he uttered were, “Hey, Ram.” He was waiting for it;
that’s why I say one hundred percent. And he was rejoiced – he wanted to
die, because his ideology was no longer listened to. Nobody was ready to
follow his suggestions.</p><p><br></p><p>The country had become free. Gandhi was needed when the country was
under slavery, under British rule, because he controlled the masses. The
superstitious Indians cannot be controlled by logic, by reason. They can
only be controlled by their emotions, sentimentality, superstitions,
religiousness, and all kinds of rubbish. Gandhi was an expert in
rubbish.</p><p>I have no desire to live the next moment, or to die the next moment.
I have known and experienced everything that is possible. If existence
allows me one moment more, I will create a little more disturbance in
people. If existence feels that I am no more needed, it is perfectly
good to go into eternal sleep. To me, death is not going to be a death,
because I am not going to be reborn.</p><p>You are reborn if you have committed mistakes, and if you feel
guilty. Albert Einstein must have been reborn, and of course, as a
plumber, because the last desire becomes the seed for your future life.
I have no desire. My death will not be a death.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we make a difference. When an ordinary man dies, it is
death. When someone who has attained enlightenment dies, it is samadhi,
it is not death. And the word “samadhi” is immensely significant.
Samadhi means: one who has attained the ultimate harmony with
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s8>7</span></p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin is extraordinarily ordinary</p><p><br></p><p>4 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I CAN’T CONCEIVE OF YOU EVER BEING UNENLIGHTENED. DID YOU REALLY
BECOME</p><p>ENLIGHTENED ONLY THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO?</p><p><br></p><p>Neither can I conceive it. This is one of the very fundamental things
in the nature of enlightenment. Once you are enlightened, you are in a
very strange situation – trying to conceive how you could manage to
remain unenlightened for so many lives. It is a tremendous work, it
needs great effort. Misery, jealousy, competitiveness – all that is ugly
is needed to remain unenlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment itself is simple, it is natural. Unenlightenment is
your creation.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is a gift from existence. So it is up to you how long
you want to remain unenlightened. Any moment you can drop
unenlightenment. Never ask how to become enlightened, because nobody can
become enlightened. Everybody is born enlightened. Just ask, “How can we
drop all those props that are keeping us unenlightened?”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story in Gautam Buddha’s life. Again and again
he has told it.…</p><p><br></p><p>In one of his past lives he met an enlightened being. Out of respect
he touched his feet. But he was surprised – in return the enlightened
man touched his feet. Buddha could not believe his eyes. He said, “What
are you doing? I am an unenlightened man, ignorant. I have not
experienced truth. I</p><p><br></p><p>have not yet been able to love, to be compassionate. My laughter is
still phony, my heart is full of</p><p>discontent. Why have you touched my feet?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the enlightened being laughed. He said, “Don’t be worried. As far
as I am concerned, you are as enlightened as I am.”</p><p>From your side, that is your problem – I don’t see any of you here as
unenlightened, it is impossible. Enlightenment is your very center, your
very being. But you have been conditioned, programmed to remain
unenlightened. All your religions are responsible for it. They don’t
want you to become enlightened, because an enlightened man cannot be a
Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan. From his state of consciousness, all
these theologies, religions, are sheer nonsense – fictions created by
ignorant people for other ignorant people.</p><p><br></p><p>Never ask how to be enlightened. You can ask how to remain
unenlightened, that is relevant. If you want to be enlightened, you are
this very moment. Nobody is preventing you except yourself.</p><p>And you are making so much hard, arduous effort to become
enlightened. That is one of the ways to remain unenlightened. The very
effort keeps you troubled; and each effort is going to fail, because
what you are already you cannot become.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see the difference between these two simple words: being and
becoming. Enlightenment is being – you cannot become it. Becoming is a
process somewhere in the future after long journeys, doing all kinds of
stupid things – yoga postures, Christian prayers, fasts, remaining
celibate, entering into a monastery forever, you will not come out of
it.…</p><p><br></p><p>There are monasteries where you enter but unless you are thrown out
you cannot get out; only your dead body comes out some day. I have heard
about such a monastery. It was famous for two things: one, for one
thousand years no woman had entered into the monastery – it was
prohibited. Even a six-month-old baby girl was not allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>When I heard about it I thought, were monks living in the monastery,
or monsters? A six-month-old baby is not allowed in! You can conceive
the mind of those people who are living inside.</p><p>And second, it was famous in that silence was the rule. Only after
seven years – once, after seven years – if you wanted to say something
to the abbot, you could say it, and then for seven years again
silence.</p><p><br></p><p>One man became a monk. For seven years he suffered, because the
mattress was missing, he was sleeping on a bare floor. It was hard, it
was cold, but he had to wait for seven years to say, “I need a
mattress.”</p><p>Seven years, by and by, passed – they must have looked to that man
almost like seven centuries. And he was so happy when he went to the
abbot and said, “Master, I have a complaint to make. In the room you
have allotted me, there is no mattress. And for seven years I have been
prohibited from speaking.”</p><p><br></p><p>The abbot said, “Okay, a mattress will be provided immediately. You
go back.”</p><p><br></p><p>A mattress was provided. But the cell in which the monk was living
was very small, and the door was very small, and the mattress was big.
So while they were bringing the mattress in, the door fell out and the
window’s glass was broken. Somehow they forced that big mattress into
the small room. For seven years the poor man again suffered – from rain,
wind, snow, because there was no door and the window was broken. In
fact, he started thinking that the first seven years were far more
beautiful: “I was an idiot to make that complaint!”</p><p><br></p><p>Again after seven years he went to the abbot. And the abbot said,
“Again?”</p><p>The man said, “I have to say something, I am compelled to say it: the
mattress that was provided was bigger than my cell, and the people, the
other monks who brought it, somehow forced it in. I could not say no – I
could not speak. They broke the door, they broke the window, and you can
conceive – for seven years I have been living in wind, in rain, in snow.
I was not thinking that I would be able to survive, but somehow by God’s
grace I am here again. Please put the door back and mend the
window.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was too much. The abbot became angry, and he said, “In all these
fourteen years you have done nothing but complain, complain, complain!
This is not a way to be religious. You simply get lost!”</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not something to be achieved. It is not an
achievement, it is not a goal far away that you have to journey to. It
is not a pilgrimage at all. The more you seek and search for
enlightenment, the more you will miss it, and the more miserable you
will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is a very simple understanding. So once you stop all
efforts to be enlightened and just remain at ease with yourself, totally
accepting yourself as you are.… That’s how existence meant you to be.
Don’t try to improve upon existence, you cannot do that. Relax, be
existential, not religious. And suddenly you are amazed, “My God! I have
always been enlightened.”</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is right. After enlightenment everybody is amazed – and
knows that he has always been enlightened.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago I awoke from the nightmare of making a
continuous effort to attain enlightenment. I simply dropped all efforts
to be enlightened. I simply accepted myself as I am – good or bad. I
simply stopped judging myself. And a miracle happened: with judgment
disappearing, with ambition to become enlightened disappearing, it was
as if I came out of a nightmare fully awake. And when I saw myself as
enlightened, I saw the whole existence as enlightened.</p><p>You are part of a tremendous blissfulness, but you are keeping
yourself closed. You go on doing something against nature, against
existence. You have been taught that to be natural is something wrong;
you feel guilty when you are natural. You feel happy when you repress
your nature, when you become phony, a hypocrite. All religions have been
doing only one thing for thousands of years: making people
hypocrites.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to drop all that crap, and just be yourself – with no
effort to go anywhere, because you are already there, this very
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I know about a man who is present amongst you, his name begins with
“T”. Forgive me, I cannot tell you his full name. I know his tent
number, but I cannot tell you the tent number. He has come here to
assassinate me.</p><p>I cannot tell you his name and his tent number, because I don’t want
to interfere in anybody’s life. If he wants to assassinate me, and can
have a moment of joy – I have had enough, so let him have the joy.</p><p><br></p><p>But I would like him to wait at least for the 6th of July, because I
have a date with death. Whenever I die, I will die on the 6th of July.
The year does not matter, but the 6th of July matters. I want it
permanently to be the Master’s day. So, Mr. T., only this much favor you
have to do for me.</p><p><br></p><p>He is trying to find ways, proper situations, spaces, places, from
where he can assassinate me, and he is in much trouble. I am perfectly
willing – after enlightenment what is there? All is fulfilled. I will be
of every help to him. He could have approached me and asked, “How to
assassinate you?” and I could have given him exactly the right
information. I could have left my bedroom door open in the night...
because I don’t want that man to suffer. After assassinating me, my
sannyasins will not leave him to himself. He will be killed immediately,
and I am against violence. But that is the trouble he is facing:
everywhere there are thousands of sannyasins – he will be caught.</p><p>I cannot even do what Jesus did on the cross. He prayed to God. There
is no God, so I cannot pray.</p><p>And he said to God, “Please forgive these people because they know
not what they are doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>That too, I cannot say, because Mr. T. knows exactly what he is doing
or planning to do. He just does not know how to do it. He seems to be an
amateur. I feel sorry for him; perhaps he will not be able to do what he
has come here for. I cannot interfere with him, I cannot interfere with
my sannyasins. And my sannyasins also have guns. I don’t interfere with
anybody.</p><p>I have always been enlightened, but just thirty-two years ago I
recognized it, just thirty-two years ago I became aware of it. And the
same is going to happen to you too. Whenever you become awakened, you
are in for a great surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WOMEN HAVE A BETTER FEELING FOR OTHERS THAN MEN DO. HOW COME THERE
HAVE BEEN NO GREAT MASTERS AMONG THEM SO FAR?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very delicate question, and a little difficult too – about
women everything is difficult – but I will try my best.</p><p>First, you never ask why no man in the whole history of existence has
been pregnant, why he has not given birth to a child. You simply know
that biologically he has no womb. He can make many women pregnant. This
has to be understood; that’s why there have been religions which allow
four wives to a man, but no religion allows four husbands to a women,
for the simple reason that a man can make many women pregnant. But once
a woman is pregnant, then you can bring Muhammad Ali the Great – even he
cannot do anything; for nine months the woman is booked.</p><p><br></p><p>I know women have a much more feeling heart, are more loving, are
more open, are more receptive. But these are the qualities of a
disciple, not of a master. The disciple has to be open, receptive,
vulnerable, loving, feeling. The only thing the disciple has to drop is
his mind, not his heart. His mind is a constant disturbance. It goes on
creating skepticism, and a disciple cannot be a skeptic.</p><p>The woman can be a prefect disciple, but cannot be a perfect master.
Now, I am not responsible for it, I am simply saying what the fact is.
And you can see it with your own eyes. I have more women disciples
around the world than men, and I can trust women more than men. I have
given every responsible job in all the communes around the world to
women, not to men.</p><p><br></p><p>You must be surprised, because man has better reasoning, is more
rational, is more authoritative, is more interested in being higher and
higher in a hierarchy. The woman is not interested in hierarchy. Her
interest in life is not through reasoning, but through feeling. Logic is
not her world – love is her world.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a master is a very strange job. You have to convince people
about the heart by argument and reason, rationality, philosophy; you
have to use the mind as a servant for the heart. The master’s work is to
take your mind away from you, so that your whole energy moves into your
heart.</p><p>It is from the heart that we are connected with existence, it is not
from the mind. Nobody can go directly from mind to existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind can create science, but it cannot create poetry, it cannot
create paintings, it cannot create sculpture. And it is impossible for
the mind to go into the dimension of religion. If the mind tries to go
into the dimension of religion it creates theology, not religion.</p><p>The word “theology” has to be understood: theo means God, logy is
logic – logic about God. Mind is capable of creating logic about God,
arguments about God. God is not there, but through your argumentation,
your reasoning, you can create a hypothetical God. All gods of all
religions are hypotheses, and hypotheses which are absolutely
unnecessary – not only unnecessary but dangerous, because if you get
caught up in those hypothetical gods you are not going to ever find the
authentic truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Heart knows no argument; it feels. And existence has to be felt. Even
when a man feels existence, he feels through the heart. But the heart
cannot convince anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>The man has a tremendous capacity for logic and reason. Once he has
found reality, enlightenment, through his heart, he can use the mind to
spread the fragrance that he has found. The woman cannot do it. That’s
why there have been not only no great masters, there have been no
masters who were women. Even the famous religious women saints were
disciples.</p><p>Saint Teresa – I don’t mean Mother Teresa – Saint Meera, Saint
Lalla... these three women were absolutely capable of becoming great
masters, but the could not. They became enlightened, but they remained
devotees.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is nothing great in being a master; it is just a technical
thing. The real thing is to realize your potential and your
flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is like: “Why in history has a woman never been a
husband?” What can I do? A woman has to be a wife, and there is no
suggestion that the husband is higher than the wife. In fact, just the
opposite is the case.</p><p>I have never come across any husband who is not henpecked. If you
don’t want to become henpecked, then be a freelance lover, then never
get married. Marriage simply means you have surrendered your freedom,
your individuality – everything. Yes, when you go out of the house you
go like a lion, roaring. But when you come back to the house you come
like a rat, trembling. It is a strange thing.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a factual story I am going to tell you. Akbar, a great Mogul
emperor in India – perhaps the greatest Mogul who has ruled India – was
very curious about everything. One day he asked his council of wise
people – he had collected nine of the most famous wise men around
himself in his court – he asked them, “Can you find a husband who is not
henpecked?”</p><p><br></p><p>Only one remained silent. He was the most wise; his name was Birbal.
The other eight said, “Yes, we</p><p>can find many husbands, what to say about one?”</p><p><br></p><p>Akbar looked at Birbal and he said, “You have not raised your
hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot, because even you are a henpecked husband. You are
a great emperor of a vast subcontinent, and I know the moment you enter
your harem, you are nobody; the woman rules over you. These eight people
don’t know the reality. First they should think about themselves. I
would like to ask these eight people, ‘Are you henpecked or not?’ As far
as I am concerned, I am. When I cannot remain free, I don’t believe
these people are free. They have not pondered over it. But give them a
chance – if they can find one, it will be a revelation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those eight wise men went to New Delhi, the capital of India, to look
for a man who was not henpecked. Akbar gave them two horses, beautiful
horses from Kabul, one pure white and one pure black. And he said,
“Whoever you find that is not henpecked, you can give one of these two
beautiful horses as a reward from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were really precious. In those days horses were something of a
treasure; to have a beautiful, strong horse was a great joy. Now there
are no more horses; there are cars which have horsepower.</p><p><br></p><p>Those eight wise men went around the capital, and they were getting
frustrated again and again, because they could not find one. The
condition was: “If you say you are not henpecked, and it is proved not
right, you will be hanged. If it is proved right, one of these two
horses will be your reward.” There was nobody courageous enough to take
the risk.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one man they found, who was a very strong man – seven feet tall,
a great wrestler, a champion wrestler. He was sitting outside his house
in the garden. His body was something to see; so solid that if he hit a
man just with his fist, he could kill him. He looked like a man made of
steel.</p><p><br></p><p>They thought, “Perhaps this man is the man we are searching for.”
They asked him, “Are you henpecked?”</p><p>He said, “If you repeat it again, I will kill all of you. Me
henpecked? Are you mad?”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked inside the house. A very small woman, very thin, was
cooking food. The eight men said to the strong man, “Just to find out
the facts – which horse would you like as a reward, the black or the
white?”</p><p>And the man turned back and asked his wife, “Muna’s mother” – that is
the way in India it is done. You cannot take the name of the husband or
the wife. The wife says, “Muna’s father,” the husband says, “Muna’s
mother.” Muna is just like Tom, Dick, Harry. He asked, “Muna’s mother,
should I take the white horse or the black?”</p><p><br></p><p>Muna’s mother said, “If you take the black horse, I will give you
hell! Take the white one.” And he told the wise people, “I would like to
take the white one.”</p><p>They said, “You come with us – you don’t get either. You will be
hanged!”</p><p><br></p><p>In the house, within the boundaries of the house, the woman has
tremendous power. But she is not interested in the outside world.
Women’s natures are different. A woman can become a great disciple, but
for a woman to become a master is almost impossible. But there is no
question of somebody being higher.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is not higher than the disciple. The master is simply
trying to awaken you. The moment you are awakened there is no master and
no disciple. It is just out of gratitude that the disciple remains a
disciple – just out of gratitude. But there is no difference; they have
known the same reality. They have become what nature wanted them to
become, they have blossomed.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t feel depressed that women have not been great masters – they
have been great disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>Man finds it difficult to become a disciple. In fact, man should
worry about it, because to become a disciple is the real thing – and the
beginning. And to come to the perfection of being a disciple is the
end.</p><p>A man passes through a very difficult phase. He cannot become a
disciple, or can become one only in a wishy-washy way, always ready to
quit. And without becoming a disciple, there is no question of becoming
a master. Yes, once in a while it happens that a man becomes a master
without becoming a disciple. But for that immense patience, a certain
stubbornness, is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have any master. In my previous lives I never had any master.
I have lived with many masters, I have known many masters, but I could
not manage to become a disciple. That is why I am so late; otherwise,
Jesus would not have preceded me. But it was simply difficult for me to
be a disciple. I remained searching, and searching on my own. Yes, it
took many many lives to arrive where I have always been.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never been initiated by anyone. I am not a sannyasin. I am
really outside of any crowd, and</p><p>that’s the way I have always been. It was a long, arduous journey to
find that there is nothing to find.</p><p><br></p><p>Women are far more fortunate, because the beginning is in their hand,
and the beginning is almost half the achievement. That I can see
myself.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the basic reason why women could not become great masters.
But there is no need to feel sad. They became great disciples – which is
far more fortunate, because to begin from the beginning is easier than
to begin from the end.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS COMMUNITY FOR A FEW YEARS. WHAT DO YOU
THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND? HOW CAN
OUTSIDERS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A
SANNYASIN? HOW CAN WE SHOW WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT SANNYASINS?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not one question, there are many questions in it. First, this
is not a community, it is a commune –</p><p>and there is a vast difference between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity is a community, Hinduism is a community. A community is
a closed phenomenon. This is a commune, it is an open reality. Anybody
can enter – anybody. I have not made any qualifications to be fulfilled
before you become a sannyasin. And any moment you want to leave, it is
absolutely acceptable; you are not condemned. You are received with
love, and if you want to leave, you are given a goodbye with love. It is
a very important thing to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>In existence nothing is closed, everything is open. In existence
there is no noun to be found, everything is a verb. It is our language
which has made great trouble.</p><p>You call a tree a tree, a river a river, but you are not aware that
the tree is constantly growing; it is not dead, it is alive. In a better
language it would be “treeing,” because it is growing. For a river a
better word would be “rivering,” because it is flowing. Everything is a
verb, always moving, growing, expanding, changing.</p><p><br></p><p>A community is a dead thing. A commune is alive, growing, expanding,
open – people coming in, going out.</p><p>I am not offended when somebody leaves the commune; it is not my
business. I never try to convert anybody to become a sannyasin. It was
his desire to be a sannyasin, it is his desire to leave it. You cannot
blame me. I remain completely a witness, like a mirror; things go on
passing. When they are in front of the mirror, the mirror reflects them.
When they go out, the mirror remains silent. It is not angry, it is not
feeling that something has to be condemned.</p><p><br></p><p>But the people who have left the commune – they are not many – they
only think they have left the commune, because I have not left them.
Wherever they are, they are talking against me – here they were talking
for me. In fact, here they may have forgotten me, may have taken me for
granted; once they leave the commune, I am with them twenty-four hours a
day. Whether you talk in favor of me or against me, you belong to me.
Once a sannyasin you are always a sannyasin. You can drop the clothes,
you can throw the mala, but you don’t know; it is impossible to be
anything else again, you will remain a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, that is the trouble for those few people who have left –
mostly they are men; if a woman has left, she has left because of the
man she loved. These people who have left the commune cannot mix with
the outside world. If you have left me, forget all about me! They cannot
forget me. Don’t forgive me, but please forget me! They cannot mix with
the outside world, because I have deprogrammed them. When they are in
church listening to an idiotic sermon, they will remember me, and they
will be in favor of me inside their hearts.</p><p><br></p><p>So what do these people do? They start creating a small group. In
America, in Santa Fe, there are a dozen sannyasins who have left. Now,
why are they all in Santa Fe? That is my commune! They are just stupid
people – why waste time on a man with whom you are no longer, from your
side, in communion? Why waste your time? Those twelve people there in
Santa Fe are continuously talking about me, against me.</p><p>Do you understand the psychological phenomenon? They cannot get rid
of me. If they are not in favor of me, then they are against me, but
they cannot get rid of me.</p><p>And why have they gathered together? Because in the outside world,
who is going to listen to them talking against me – people who don’t
know me? And they have gathered also because they cannot mix with the
outside world. They cannot be again Christians and Hindus and
Mohammedans and Buddhists. They were Rajneeshees, now they are
anti-Rajneeshees. It makes no difference at all: they are my people. And
in existence everything has its opposite as a complementary. These
people are complementary Rajneeshees.</p><p><br></p><p>A commune is a flowing phenomenon, a rivering, a treeing, a
flowering. It is not a noun. So please don’t call my commune a
community, it is not a community. A community is closed. A community
depends on belief. A commune depends on communion. Here people are
meeting heart to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>You have asked, “How to explain sannyas, sannyasins, this commune, to
the outsiders?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not possible. They will think you are crazy. The only way is to
somehow trick them into coming here. It is something to be experienced,
not explained. It is not a theory, it is something existent.</p><p>Just think of a country where no flowers grow. Can you explain to
those people what a flower is? They will laugh, they will say, “You must
have hallucinated, you must have gone crazy. Trees never give flowers.”
They will not understand the word “flower.” You will have to take them
to where flowers exist. They can see with their own eyes, and they can
smell with their own nostrils.</p><p><br></p><p>I lived in India in a place, Jabalpur, for at least twenty years.
Just thirteen miles outside Jabalpur is one of the most beautiful spots
– perhaps the most beautiful in the whole world, something that seems to
be not of this world. A great river, Narmada, flows between two
mountains there. The mountains are not ordinary mountains, they are
marble mountains. Just think of a white, marble mountain... for two
miles on both sides, two marble mountains. The river flows just in
between, and in the full moon night the mountains are reflected.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried my best to explain to one of my teachers in the university
who loved me very much – Dr. S.K. Satena. He had been a professor in
America, in Hawaii, around the world; he was one of the foremost
authorities on Indian philosophy. I tried hard to explain to him, but he
said, “I have seen the</p><p><br></p><p>whole world – you cannot convince me. You have not seen the whole
world, you cannot convince me that there is a spot which is the most
beautiful in the whole world. I know the whole world, you have not
traveled anywhere.”</p><p>I said, “It is not a question of comparison. The moment you see the
place You cannot conceive</p><p>that anything can be more beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tortured him continuously. Finally he agreed, “Okay, I am coming
with you.”</p><p>On a full moon night I took him there. For thirteen miles he was
continually saying, “I don’t see anything here.” I remained silent. He
said, “You are very articulate, very vocal. This is the first time I am
seeing you silent, and I am continually saying that I don’t see
anything.” But I remained silent. He said, “What has happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You just wait” – because those thirteen miles are ordinary.
Beautiful road, surrounded with beautiful trees, but nothing special. I
took him in a boat. For almost half a mile the mountains are not marble.
He asked, “Is this the place?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Just wait. When the place comes I will not need to tell you,
‘This is it.’” After half a mile,</p><p>suddenly you enter into those marble rocks and the river, the deep
river. I remained silent.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am sorry. This is it.” He had tears in his eyes, because
he had not listened to me for two</p><p>years. He said to me, “I might have died without seeing this
place.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we went deeper the place became just something other-worldly,
almost a dreamland. He said to me – he is a very logical man – he said,
“Take the boat close to the rocks. I want to touch them and see whether
they are there, or I am hallucinating, or you have given me some
drug.”</p><p>I had to take the boat close to the mountains. He touched them, he
kissed them, and he said, “You</p><p>need not go around the world to find the most beautiful place. This
is it.”</p><p>This is my answer to you. Don’t try to explain to anybody. This is an
experience – or, in my language, an experiencing; the word “experience”
again is dead. It is a continuous experiencing. Come again after one
month and you will see the commune’s new colors, new faces, new dances,
new songs. I am not a consistent man, neither are my people. I am
consistent only as far as inconsistency is concerned. Whenever you come
you will find an alive, breathing commune – new flowers, new dances, new
songs.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to bring those people. If you tell them that this is a
religion, they will think it must be like Christianity. And you know the
inside of a church – gloomy, reminds you of death, a cross in front of
you.… If you talk to a Christian, his experience of a church will come
and disturb your explanation. What can you say? He will not believe that
this is possible – a godless, a religionless religion? A religion that
has no holy book? – because I call all holy books, holy shit!</p><p><br></p><p>There are far better books than your holy books. Don’t waste your
time with reading THE BIBLE, the GITA, the KORAN. It is better to give
the time to Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky; you will be immensely
enriched by these people. Don’t be bothered with the Old Testament when
I am giving you the Last Testament – unless you are an antique
collector, that is a different matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is always fresh. It remains fresh only when it finds a master
to speak it. You can write notes. Remember, those notes will not have
the same quality, the same fragrance, the same truth – although the
words will be the same as I am speaking.</p><p>Do you know that no master ever wrote a book in the whole history of
humanity? Can it be just a coincidence? No, it is not a coincidence. No
master ever wrote a single book, for the simple reason that the moment
the word is written it is dead, it is a corpse. The word has to be
alive. It has to come from the heart, it has to beat. Only then can it
reach to your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Only heart can commune with heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Bring those people here. There is no other way of explaining what is
happening; otherwise, you will become a laughingstock. This is a very
dangerous game. Truth cannot be explained, it cannot be described. But
truth can be tasted.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember, a missionary had gone to the cannibals in Africa. He was
the first Christian missionary who had dared to go to the cannibals to
convert them to Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>Cannibals are the most difficult people to convert. They have not
even dropped eating man, they have eaten their own people. In the
beginning – the beginning of this century– there were thousands of
cannibals in Africa. There are only three hundred left, because if you
cannot get your food from outside, you eat your children, you eat your
old men – what else to do? Their number goes on decreasing; they will
disappear. Perhaps the last cannibal will have to eat himself.</p><p><br></p><p>But the missionary was a fanatic. And just the way Jesus believed
that God would save him from the cross, a miracle would happen.… And
nothing happened. It was such a disappointment to thousands of people
who had come to see the miracle. It was a greater disappointment to
Jesus himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked again and again upwards – as if God is sitting on the roof
of Rajneesh Mandir. He called, prayed – no answer, no miracle. Not even
an angel playing on the harp, coming down on a cloud – nothing stirred.
Slowly people started going away, thinking that it was just a waste of
time, the whole day wasted in the heat.</p><p><br></p><p>This Christian bishop was also just as fanatical as Jesus Christ. He
said, “The Lord is with me. What can the cannibals do to me?” But the
cannibals did what they wanted to do. It is strange, this God of your is
very strange. He was not with the priest, he was with the cannibals; he
was not with Jesus Christ, he was with Barabbas.</p><p><br></p><p>When Pontius Pilate asked It was a ritual that if the people demanded
it, then one person could be</p><p>freed from being crucified. Three persons were being crucified that
day. One was Jesus Christ, who was utterly innocent, simple – more
exactly, a simpleton. Pontius Pilate was thinking that people would ask
for Jesus, because the other two were confirmed criminals; Barabbas had
committed many murders. And the people asked for Barabbas to be
released!</p><p>God’s miracle was happening to Barabbas, not to Jesus – and not just
one time. Because Barabbas was accustomed to murder, he did not care
about crucifixion or anything, so even though he was</p><p><br></p><p>forgiven In fact, Barabbas was resurrected, not Jesus Christ. From
the cross he was brought</p><p>down; he was reborn, not Jesus Christ. God! Perhaps this was the
miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>Within three months Barabbas was caught again, because he had
murdered, in three months, three people. But the law was, once a man is
given freedom from the death sentence by the Roman emperor, then he can
never be crucified again. So now they could not crucify him for his
murders; they had to find a substitute. They sent him to Sicily to work
in a coal mine for his whole life. And you will be surprised: the coal
mine collapsed, all other prisoners – there were thousands – died, and
Barabbas was saved!</p><p><br></p><p>And you think Jesus is saved? And these fanatic Christians are trying
to save others.</p><p><br></p><p>A miracle did happen: thousands of people died and Barabbas was the
only one who was saved. Even the emperor of Rome was impressed; twice
the man had been saved. Barabbas was called to Rome for their annual
festival, where they brought their criminals to fight with lions. And
you will not believe me: Barabbas was again saved. He killed the
lion!</p><p><br></p><p>Even the emperor called him close and touched him; he seemed to be
the very representative of God. He gave him not only freedom but
first-class citizenship – because slaves are second-class people, and
Barabbas was a slave, sentenced for his whole life. The emperor freed
him. This God seems to be crazy. This whole idea is nothing but
imagination, projection.</p><p>The fanatical missionary was caught immediately by the cannibals. He
said to them, “Have you ever tasted Christianity?”</p><p>They said, “Wait. Just within an hour<span class=s6></span>Look at
that pot.” There was a pot, a big pot boiling.</p><p><br></p><p>The missionary could not understand. He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We will put you in that boiling pot and make a soup of
you, and then we will taste</p><p>Christianity for the first time. Everybody is so eager to taste
Christianity.”</p><p><br></p><p>I think those barbarians were right: religion is something to be
tasted, not explained. Bring those people here. We are not barbarians,
we are vegetarians.</p><p><br></p><p>Only in this milieu can you help your friends to understand what
sannyas is all about, and what this commune is.</p><p>You are asking me if there is something special about a sannyasin
that you can tell to your people. Yes, there is. A sannyasin is
extraordinarily ordinary. He has no claims to any superiority. Not only
in regard to human beings, he is in tune with trees and birds and rivers
and clouds, and he claims no superiority even to animals and trees and
rocks. We are all part of one cosmos. But please don’t try logically,
rationally to explain this to them. This is not a theology that I am
giving to you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a taste, this is an experiencing. This is love, not
logic.</p><p><br></p><p>But why are you concerned to explain to those outsiders? As far as I
can tell, you are still not a sannyasin, because a sannyasin would not
ask such a question. If you really want to help people to understand the
tremendous phenomenon that is happening here, the first step should be:
become a sannyasin. Of course, you will be thought mad. So what? In a
mad world, to be thought mad means you are the only sane person.</p><p>Become sane. That is the meaning of becoming a sannyasin. Question
4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>SHOULD WE TAKE YOUR ADVICE NOT TO TAKE ANYONE’S ADVICE?</p><p>Advice is the only thing in the world which everybody gives and
nobody takes.</p><p><br></p><p>You can ask me a question, but you cannot ask for advice; I am not
that foolish. I will never give you any advice, because who am I to give
you advice? You are unique, every individual is unique. My advice will
be my experience. That may distract you from your own life, that may
take you away from your own being. I have never advised anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you can ask a question. The answer that I give only has to be
understood, it has not to be accepted on my authority. You have to be
just a listener to it, without any prejudice. My answer, listened to
without any prejudice, will become a totally different thing in you; it
will be molded by your being. Then it is no longer mine; it is
yours.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the function of a master – not to create followers, but to
create masters.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying anything to be believed. I am saying, just give me a
little understanding, try to understand what I am saying to you. Listen
– and it will take a different shape, a different form, a different aura
within you. It will not be the same that was said, because words are
empty.</p><p><br></p><p>When the words are in my heart they are full. The moment they leave
my lips, the content is left behind; only the container reaches you. But
if you allow the container to enter you, it will reach your heart –
because it is coming from the heart – and your heart will fill it with
its own content. Then it is yours, it has nothing to do with me.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot blame me; whatever happens to you, it is your
responsibility. I just like talking – I don’t take any responsibility.
Why should I take anybody’s responsibility? I like talking, you like
listening – good! So far, so good.</p><p>But understand the whole alchemy of listening: listening rightly, you
will have your own understanding flowering. You will not be dependent on
me, you will not be my follower. You will be yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking for advice. I don’t give any advice. And I say to you,
don’t ask anyone for advice</p><p>either. You ask advice only because you are not courageous enough to
experience on your own.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you ask for advice, you become a slave. And if you follow
it, you have committed suicide.</p><p>I don’t want you to commit suicide. I want you to grow higher and
higher into life, into love, into light.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s8>8</span></p><p><br></p><p>With me begins a new era of enlightenment</p><p><br></p><p>5 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY HAVEN’T OTHER ENLIGHTENED MASTERS TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD,
JESUS,</p><p>HEAVEN AND HELL?</p><p><br></p><p>The phenomenon of enlightenment is very rare. It should not be so,
because everyone is born enlightened and then enters into a dark tunnel
of religions, cultures, civilizations, education. Enlightened you are
born, unenlightened you die. That’s why I say it should not be so
rare.</p><p>It should be just the contrary; most of the people should be
enlightened, to find unenlightened people</p><p>should be difficult. But that’s not what has been happening down the
ages.</p><p>The society is not interested in enlightened people. They are
dangerous, contagious. They cannot be enslaved – and all societies want
people to be enslaved, exploited, oppressed.</p><p>The enlightened person is rebellious, against all that man has been
doing to other human beings. That’s why all the societies from the very
beginning start closing the doors and the windows from where any light
can enter the child. They will start making him a Christian. Now, no
Christian can be enlightened. He will have to drop his Christianity
before he becomes enlightened. The same is true about Hinduism,
Mohammedanism, Buddhism, communism, fascism.</p><p>The enlightened person has no “ism.” He need not be concerned with
any ideology. He has his own</p><p>eyes open, he can see; he need not think. Only a blind man thinks
about where the door is to get</p><p><br></p><p>out, where the road is to move on. Only a blind man waits for someone
to help him to cross the road. Only a blind man needs a guide, a master;
if you have eyes, you cross the road yourself, you find the door
yourself. In fact, there is no question of finding: you don’t even think
about it, you see it.</p><p>Please understand the difference between seeing and thinking.
Thinking is a very poor substitute for seeing. If you have not seen a
lotus flower, howsoever you think about it, you will not be able to
figure out what a lotus flower is. The moment you see it, thinking
stops. There is nothing to think about; the thing itself is in front of
you. And a lotus flower is so beautiful that it is bound to stop your
thinking process at least for a second. Only in that second will you
experience the beauty, the grandeur, the godliness of the flower.</p><p><br></p><p>The world is divided into civilizations, societies, cultures. They
all do the same thing to the visitors coming into the world, the new
people – the children. Mankind has committed the greatest crime against
its own children. The children are dependent on you, they think you know
all – and you know perfectly well that you know nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The children are very curious about each and every thing. They are
continuously asking, their enquiry is constant. You try to shut them up
– not because their questions are irrelevant, but because you don’t have
answers. And you know perfectly well that by the time they reach your
age, they will understand the situation – and they will do the same with
their own children. This goes on and on, generation to generation; hence
very rarely have there been enlightened people.</p><p><br></p><p>Of the people who are known as enlightened, at least eighty percent
are just bogus. How can they criticize God, Jesus, heaven and hell? In
fact, they are accepted as enlightened because they accept Jesus as the
son of God. They are accepted as enlightened because they go on telling
people they have seen God, met God, talked with him; he has sent
messages through them to you. How can they criticize God? That is their
foundation. How can they criticize heaven and hell? Their whole
enlightenment, saintliness, wisdom, depends on these fictions.
Destroying them, they will destroy themselves.</p><p>Hence, eighty percent of your so-called enlightened people are more
unenlightened than you are. But it is a strange world. The blind go on
leading other blind. Of course, finally they all fall in a ditch someway
or other. But the other blind far away in the line don’t know that the
leader and the close followers have fallen in a ditch and
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot accept anything that is not my own experience. I have
enquired without any investment. I do not want to be worshipped; hence,
I am not dependent on you. I do not want to become a God to you; hence I
am absolutely free to say what is the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Eighty percent of enlightened people have been either Christians or
Hindus or Mohammedans or Buddhists. To me this is something of a
fundamental contradiction. A man is enlightened and is still a
Mohammedan? Then what is the difference between blind people and
enlightened people? At least he should renounce Mohammedanism, Hinduism,
Christianity. He should simply say, “I am myself. I am not a sheep, and
I don’t need any shepherd. I am a man of my own consciousness, and I
have a light of my own. I don’t need THE BIBLE to guide me, or the VEDAS
to be my vision. I have my own vision.”</p><p><br></p><p>An enlightened person cannot belong to any religion. He belongs to
existence. So you can cut off eighty percent of your enlightened people
without any difficulty.</p><p>Ten percent of enlightened people remain silent. You never come to
know about them, for the simple reason that you cannot understand
silence. And to be enlightened is one thing; to give it an expression is
totally different. And unless the enlightened person starts expressing
his vision, his experience, his realization, how are you going to know
about him?</p><p><br></p><p>Why do ten percent choose to remain silent? It is because to be
articulate is a different quality, it does not come in the same parcel
as enlightenment. You don’t expect an enlightened man to be a painter
necessarily. You don’t expect him to be a poet necessarily. Why should
you expect that he will be able to be articulate with words? And it is a
very difficult job. Perhaps the hardest job in the world is to tell you
about something you know nothing about.</p><p>Even Gautam Buddha remained silent for seven days after his
enlightenment, thinking, “What is the point? First, I cannot say what I
have seen; there are no words for it. Words are impotent and the
experience is so immense, so vast.…</p><p><br></p><p>“Words are so small, they are for day-to-day use. They are not made
by enlightened people, they are made by blind people living in darkness.
Those words have connotations of ignorance. Now, to express light
through those words is almost impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Secondly,” Buddha thought, “even if I speak, manage somehow to
deliver the message, who is going to listen?”</p><p>People are interested in money, in power, in politics, in becoming
bigger and bigger, higher and higher compared to others. Who is really
interested in enlightenment? It is just an accident if you come across a
man who is enlightened and get infected. The thing is contagious, and
there is no way of preventing it – and no antidote.</p><p><br></p><p>So Buddha said, “Even if I speak, people are not going to listen.
Perhaps they may hear, but hearing</p><p>and listening are totally different things.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I am speaking even buffaloes are hearing, donkeys are hearing,
but they are not listening. Hearing is a simple thing; you have ears,
that’s all, nothing else is needed. The buffalo will go on chewing the
grass – and you will go on talking about enlightenment. And man is not
much different; in fact he is worse, because the buffalo at least has no
rush of thoughts in her mind. She is a simple being, just chewing grass,
enjoying the morning sun, the cool air – tremendously happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen any buffalo laughing? You must think that buffaloes
don’t laugh because they are in tremendous misery. You are wrong. You
laugh because you are in tremendous misery. You need the laughter just
to keep you going.</p><p>Jews have the most beautiful jokes in the world, because they have
suffered the most in world. Strange... I have been searching my whole
life for a single Indian joke – I have not found one.</p><p><br></p><p>They have lived peacefully. India has never invaded any country, has
never been aggressive, violent, has had no desire to become bigger and
bigger, huge; India has never been imperialistic. It has</p><p><br></p><p>been invaded by many people, and for two thousand years it has been a
slave country under Hunas, Turks, Moguls, British people, Portuguese
people, French, you just say the name – and India has been invaded by
everybody.</p><p>And why did such a vast country, almost a continent, yield so easily?
They were not interested in fighting. Small groups of people... what is
England? – not bigger than a district in India. What is its population?
If all the Indians had pissed simultaneously, England would have
drowned. No atom bombs would be needed!</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that when for the first time the Americans reached the
moon, walked on the moon, they were surprised: a few Indians were
sitting there. They could not believe their eyes! They were singing
their bhajanas – “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.” The Americans thought, “My
God! We have been putting so much energy, science, money into reaching
the moon – how have these idiots managed?”</p><p><br></p><p>They asked the Indians. The Indians said, “It is not difficult. We
just started standing upon each other’s shoulders, and finally we
reached.”</p><p><br></p><p>India is a huge and vast country. Eight hundred million people...
eighty hundred million people... no... You guess how many! They can
reach the moon without any trouble, just standing upon each other. And
small groups of Turks and Moguls defeated them!</p><p><br></p><p>This is not history; actually India has never been defeated by
anybody. India simply allowed anybody to invade – they welcomed them!
The country was peaceful, there was enough food, enough space – what did
it matter if a few more people were absorbed? There was so much to be
shared. These peaceful people, without any desire to be aggressive,
remained slaves for two thousand years, for the simple reason that they
were not interested in fighting.</p><p>Are you interested in meditation, in enlightenment? You have heard
the word, but listening to the</p><p>word “enlightenment,” does anything stir in your heart?</p><p>Buddha thought, “Whom am I going to teach? In the first place
teaching is difficult. In the second place to find a disciple is
difficult.” And he thought, “Even if I can manage to convey something of
my experience, and I can also find some disciples who cannot only hear,
but listen too<span class=s6></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Listening means hearing without thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>The prerequisite for listening is that you put your mind aside, so
you are just a pure space. It does not mean believing; you need not
believe what you listen to. But unless you listen, how can you decide
whether it is true or untrue? And a fundamental law of life is: if you
listen without thinking, you will be able to see whether it is true or
not. There will not be any need for you to think logically, to balance
this way and that, to argue for and against.</p><p>Arguing does not help. Can a blind man argue whether light exists or
not? And you have eyes – have you ever argued whether light exists or
not? Seeing is enough – you know! In the same way, listening is enough.
An immediate understanding arises.</p><p><br></p><p>For seven days Buddha pondered over the matter, and decided that it
was useless. And the final day, when he decided not to speak, his
thought was, “Many masters have existed, and what has happened? People
go on living the same way, doing everything the same way.” In fact,
things go on becoming worse. If there had been no Mohammed, thousands of
wars would have been avoided. If there had been no Jesus Christ, the
world would be much more at ease and at peace – because Christians have
been killing, Mohammedans have been killing.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s insight was that first, to bring the experience down to the
level of language evolved by blind people, some kind of braille-ish
language is needed. Then to find disciples, then to teach them to hear
rightly – that is, to listen.…</p><p>“And if a man is capable of all this,” Buddha thought, “even without
me, sooner or later he will become</p><p>enlightened. It may take a little more time, but that does not matter
in the eternity of time.”</p><p>The story is beautiful In Buddhism it is said that gods came, after
waiting seven days for Buddha to</p><p>speak. In Buddhism there is no God, but there are gods. And gods are
not creators of the world. They are just people like you who have earned
so much virtue in their past life that they are given a holiday period
in paradise. As they spend their virtue, they have to come back to the
earth again, back into the misery, the suffering. Yes, they enjoyed the
weekend in heaven Those people are</p><p>called gods in Buddhism.</p><p><br></p><p>The gods became very much afraid, because they were waiting for
Buddha to speak. If they can understand Buddha, then there will be no
need for them to end the weekend. If they can understand him and become
enlightened, then there is no need to come back into the world of
suffering, misery, pain, anguish, anxiety – gods are not superior to
enlightened people in Buddhism.</p><p>So seven gods, representing all the other gods, came down on the
seventh day when Buddha had decided not to speak, and persuaded him,
“All your arguments are right, but there may be just a few people who
are on the margin, just on the borderline, a little push and they may
jump into a new existence. And we have waited for a man of enlightenment
for thousands of years; now you have become enlightened and you are not
going to speak! One enlightened man in thousands of years, and he is not
going to speak, he is not going to be of any help to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am telling this story to make it clear to you that ten percent of
buddhas, enlightened people – that is the meaning of buddha – have
remained silent.</p><p>They have achieved, they have known, they have arrived home, and the
experience and the ecstasy is so tremendous – who has time, or energy,
or inclination to go back on the county roads to find disciples?</p><p><br></p><p>Nine percent of buddhas have spoken, but they have not criticized
Jesus, God, heaven, hell, or anything, for the simple reason that they
were aware of the fact that it is very difficult to attract people to
your vision, and if you start hitting them.… A Christian comes and you
speak against Jesus – rather than changing the man’s enquiry into a deep
intimacy, you create an enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one percent of enlightened people have tried that. And I am the
one percent – because I am not interested in any bullshit. I am not
interested in increasing my numbers, I am not a politician. I don’t care
a bit about more and more people becoming sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>There are six hundred million Catholics. So what? – just labels. I
don’t want to put a label on you. And I want to say that the ninety-nine
percent of enlightened people in the past – whether they have spoken,
remained silent, or were bogus themselves – have failed.</p><p>A new humanity has to emerge. It has to begin with a new kind of
enlightened man; there is no other way. The new enlightened man heralds
the beginning of a new history, a New Man, a new hope, a new future.</p><p><br></p><p>I will criticize everything that hinders, that prevents you from
knowing your self-nature. I will hit you hard. If you escape, that is
your problem. If you are strong enough, and you go on being with me,
soon it will be possible to drop all the crap – Christian, Hindu,
Mohammedan... crap is crap; it is very sticky.</p><p><br></p><p>And forgive me, because I have to bring you to that purity in which
you were born – in that beautiful, utter nudity, when you were just
yourself; nobody had manipulated you, you were innocent.</p><p>All the cultures and religions have used your innocence, have treated
it as ignorance. It was not ignorance; it was not knowledge either. To
be ignorant you have to be a little knowledgeable – of course, in a
wrong way, upside down. The innocent person is totally different from
the knowledgeable and the ignorant. The child is innocent, not
ignorant.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to offer you back your innocence. But much garbage has to be
moved out of the way. You are carrying all kinds of rubbish around with
you; you have become identified with it – that’s why I have to use
hammers!</p><p><br></p><p>I will expose the bogus enlightened people. I will criticize those
who remained silent – they were not people of compassion. Even if nobody
listens to you, it does not mean that you can excuse yourself. If the
sun rises and no flower blooms, do you think the sun will stop rising?
“What is the point? No bird sings, no flower blossoms” – no, the sun
will go on rising.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, to experience the ultimate automatically brings a tremendous
urge to share it. If you reject it, that is your problem. Passing by a
rosebush with beautiful fragrance, if you close your nostrils, hold your
nose with your hand, what can the rose do? But it does not mean that
roses should stop blossoming. A rose blossoms out of its own
realization. If somebody is thrilled by its fragrance, good. If nobody
even comes around it there is no harm, the rose has done its work.</p><p>I cannot forgive those people who remained silent. Even if they were
not articulate, they should have tried at least. If they could attain to
the ultimate they were people of great intelligence, they could devise
methods and ways. Listening to me, you know I go on devising methods for
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there is no method for meditation. All the methods that I
use are for a different purpose: to prepare you for meditation. Those
methods are not meditation themselves, they simply prepare you, they
bring you to the very bank of the river and leave you there. Now it is
up to you to jump and have the joy of the running water and the coolness
and the swim, or to remain stuck on the bank like a lamppost. That is up
to you.</p><p><br></p><p>But I cannot forgive those people who remained silent. They were
selfish, utterly selfish, more selfish than those people who go on
accumulating power, money, and all kinds of things of the</p><p><br></p><p>world. They are nothing, because what they are accumulating is junk.
But the man who has known enlightenment and keeps it to himself, he
cannot be forgiven. I am going to condemn those people.</p><p>And the people who have spoken – the nine percent – I have to show
you how many of them are only using borrowed knowledge. I don’t think
Jesus is enlightened, he is simply quoting the Old Testament. Here and
there he tries to improve on it, but it is not his own experience. He is
trying to prove to his people that he is the only begotten son of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was talking about Barabbas to you. When I put
Jesus Christ and Barabbas side by side, I think Barabbas looks... he was
a son of a bitch, but he looks as if he is the only begotten son of God:
three times he returned from death. Jesus does not look enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>An enlightened person cannot claim such egoistic things – that he is
the only begotten son of God, that he is the messenger, the latest
messenger, that his word is law, that those who follow him, their
paradise is guaranteed and those who are not going to follow him At the
day of judgment, the last</p><p>judgment, he will sort out people. His people will go to paradise and
the remaining ones will fall into the abysmal darkness of hell.</p><p>Sometimes I have been wondering: on the last judgment day, how many
people will be there? The</p><p>whole history<span class=s6></span>billions, trillions and
trillions. Perhaps mathematics hasn’t a number for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathematics was born in India. Only in Indian mathematics are there
numbers which can manage even the last judgment day. No other language
has words for such large numbers. The largest number in Indian
mathematics is mahashankh. Shankh means that which can be measured,
counted. Mahashank means not countable.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahashankh people will be there on the last judgment day. And
remember, half of them will be women chattering, fighting. It is going
to be a very difficult day, because a man may have been a</p><p>husband to millions of women, a woman may have been a wife to
millions of men – so many lives! There is going to be so much shouting
and fighting – I don’t think God will be able to manage judgment. And
Jesus Christ says he will sort out his people. Forget it, boy, it is
impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus was not a great mathematician either. He must have used his
fingers to count, because he was an uneducated man. Uneducated people
count on their fingers. That’s why in every language ten digits are the
basic digits, because there are ten fingers; mathematics was born out of
counting on the fingers. There are only that many real numbers; other
numbers are just additions and repetitions of those ten, again and
again.</p><p>I don’t see any statement of Jesus which proves enlightenment. He
talks about prayer, but not about meditation – and without meditation
there is no way towards enlightenment. Prayer is a childish thing. You
don’t know God. To whom are you praying? You don’t know the language
that God understands. In what language are you praying?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think that God could understand all the languages. Three
hundred languages exist just on this earth, and there are fifty thousand
planets where life exists, so there will be millions of languages. God
must have gone crazy by now – listening to all these prayers, and
consulting the dictionaries.…</p><p><br></p><p>And how can pray when you don’t know God? It is mad! Your God is a
belief. Jesus has given you a system of beliefs, he has given you a
faith.</p><p>An enlightened man gives you a science, not a faith. Belief or faith
means you simply have to accept something without knowing it. A man of
integrity will simply reject it. He will say, “Unless I know it, how can
I trust?” All the religions ask you to believe, and you have never
enquired what belief means.</p><p><br></p><p>Belief means preventing you from enquiry into truth. You already
believe there is a God – then there is no need to enquire. Science has
progressed because it is not based on beliefs. All religions are
retarded. There has been no progress in any religion – cannot be, you
have cut the very roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Faith is not needed, but an enquiring mind. But no religion supports
enquiry; they are afraid of it. If they have the truth, why should they
be afraid of enquiry? They don’t have the truth. They have invented a
God. They may say, “God created man in his own image” – the reality is
just the opposite: man has been creating God in his own image. That’s
why there are so may gods around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu God cannot have a Jewish nose, that is inconceivable. A
Mohammedan God cannot be conceived by the Jainas. A Mohammedan God says,
“Convert people to Mohammedanism by the strength of the sword.”
Mohammedanism is not argumentative, it knows nothing of logic or
rationality; it believes in the sword. Its argument is the sword.</p><p>Now, somebody puts a sword on your neck, and says, “Either be
converted to Mohammedanism or be ready to die” – because Mohammedanism
believes even if you kill a person because he was resisting conversion
to Mohammedanism, you will both be rewarded.</p><p>You will be rewarded because you tried your hardest – certainly you
did! And the other will also be rewarded because if he had been left to
live without being converted to Mohammedanism, he might have committed
many sins and would have suffered in hell. Now he is dead, and the dead
don’t commit sins. You have released that man from the opportunity to
fall into hell. And if you die fighting, you will reach paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainism cannot conceive of such a God, such a religion. Their
religion says that even if you kill an ant, you will suffer in hell.
Now, I don’t see that anybody can can be anywhere else than in hell.
Whatsoever you do, you will be killing millions of live things every
day! Your whole body system continuously goes on changing: dead cells
are thrown out of the body, new cells go on coming in. According to
Jainism, just to live is to commit a sin.</p><p>To breathe is to commit a sin, because your breath exhaled is hot,
and in the air there are millions of small living cells moving around
you. That much heat is enough to kill them. Even to breathe is enough to
send you to hell. You are not killing anybody knowingly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jaina prophet, Mahavira, slept in the night only on one side. He
would not change sides, because if you change sides you will be killing
more small living beings. Just remaining exactly in one posture the
whole night.… I cannot conceive of him being enlightened. Just think,
even in the night you cannot relax. Just keeping one posture the whole
night, can you relax? Such an unrelaxed man cannot be called
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to tell you the truth. If it hurts, that is your
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not asking anything from you – that’s why I don’t care
whether it hurts you or not. I am not the only begotten son of God, so I
don’t depend on you. I don’t claim to be the messenger of God, I don’t
claim to be a prophet; all these people are unknowingly becoming
dependent on you. They are becoming slaves to you. If all the Jews leave
Moses, his prophethood is gone. Who is going to call him a prophet? If
all the Christians drop Jesus completely, who is going to make him the
only begotten son of God?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t depend on anybody, I am simply myself. For that I don’t need
anybody’s consent, belief, faith. I don’t need anybody to nourish my
ego. And anybody who is trying to be nourished by others, particularly
for his ego, is not enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened man has no ego at all. He is simply without any “I”.
I have to use the word, but there is no corresponding reality in me. The
word “I” is just a linguistic device – it has no reality.</p><p>Whether you listen to me or not makes no difference. I am not saying
believe in me, because what I know you can know; there is no need for
any belief. All beliefs are anti-religious, anti-spiritual. All belief
systems have to be dropped, only then can man be at peace. These belief
systems are keeping you fighting each other, destroying each other. They
don’t give you even a chance to discover yourself.</p><p>Getting rid of all belief systems is liberation. For that liberation
I am criticizing people like Jesus or Mohammed or Mahavira, and I am
criticizing their strategies to exploit you: heaven and hell. Through
heaven they create fear in you, and greed. Through hell the same thing,
fear and greed. Fear and greed are poisons, but they are saying, “Those
who believe and believe totally<span class=s6></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>They are asking something impossible. That’s why you are all tense,
because you cannot manage it. How can you believe, and believe totally,
something you know nothing about? They are not even saying to you,
“Believe only hypothetically.” They are asking you, “Believe totally.”
How can you believe? Deep down you know you don’t know. Deep down you
are repressing your disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>All believers are underground unbelievers. Underground, all
Christians are continuously suffering, because by their belief they have
created a division, a split in their being. The belief says Jesus is
born out of a virgin girl! And they believe it, out of the greed for
heaven – for enjoying the beauties of heaven for eternity – and the fear
of falling into the depths of hell. And the Christian hell is the worst
– avoid it! If you want to fall into hell, fall into any other, because
every other hell has a time limit; the Christian hell is for
eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>These religions are living on your fear and greed. I have to destroy
your fear and your greed, because they are preventing you from seeing
your reality, seeing your eternal being, your immortality. I have to go
on hitting on the head of your so-called God, because if God is there
then man can never be liberated. God is another name of eternal
imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>If God can create, just out of his whim – because there seems to be
no excuse for creating the world Why did he create the world? And just
four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ</p><p><br></p><p>was born? What was he doing before that? For eternity, going
backwards, he has not done anything. What prompted him to create the
world four thousand and four years before Jesus was born?</p><p>No explanation is given by Christian theologians, because there is no
explanation. If they give any explanation, that means God can be forced
to do something. If they say that God created the world because he loved
to create, where was this love to create for the whole eternity? And
suddenly one day...? There must be some reason. No Christian theologian
in two thousand years has been able to say what prompted God to create
the world – and this world.</p><p>And if God is whimsical – that is the only possibility; he is
whimsical, eccentric, a little off the track; in short, just a nut – if
he created this world, why did he create heaven and hell? If he enjoyed
creating, he could have created you without all that which can lead you
to hell. If he can create this whole immense world, can’t he create a
man without sex, without anger, without jealousy, without greed, without
fear, without death? He seems to be a very cruel type of God, very
unkind.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he creates the priests who preach to you, “Be celibate.”
Some great conspiracy is going on. God creates you as a sexual being,
and his priest – who is infallible, the pope – teaches you to remain
celibate. Have you ever asked, “Is the pope against God?” He must be,
because God creates love in you, God creates anger in you, and the pope
says you have to drop all this. To whom are you going to listen? To God?
Or to this Polack pope? And this is the situation of all religions.</p><p>I am telling you, listen to nature and just be natural. Sex is
beautiful because it is natural. And a tremendous transformation happens
when you accept your naturalness. When you accept everything that you
are, there is a transformation, because a new thing has arisen in you:
acceptance – which all the priests of all the religions have been
destroying.</p><p><br></p><p>They destroy your acceptance of yourself, they create guilt in you.
That is something of an ultimate crime – to create guilt. And the
easiest way is to teach you to go against your own nature.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot go against nature. Who will go against it?</p><p>You are nature.</p><p><br></p><p>So all these monasteries of Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists are
full of hypocrites; there is not a single man worthy of any respect. And
these religions have created all kinds of perversions in the world. When
you suppress your sex, it starts flowing in unnatural ways. You cannot
stop nature, it will find some other way. If you keep men and women
apart you will be responsible for creating homosexuality.</p><p>When I was a lecturer in the university, the first thing I did In
India the girls and the boys cannot sit</p><p>together in the class. The girls sit on one side, the boys sit on the
other side, and a space is left</p><p>between them. The first day I entered the university I said, “Get
mixed up.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were very much puzzled, nervous. They said, “But we have been
told to remain separate.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is my class, and nature has not told you to be
separate. Nature has managed in every way to bring you closer. I am not
against nature – just get mixed up.</p><p>“And you know, when a girl is not pinched by a boy, how much she
suffers. I don’t want any suffering here. You can sit mixed up, you can
hold hands. I want you to be relaxed, because then you can hear me
better; otherwise I am wasting my time here. You are throwing your
letters to the girls and girls are throwing letters to you – I cannot
tolerate this nonsense.”</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, the vice-chancellor was very disturbed when he came to
know. He called me and asked,</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I want you just to remember your own student days.” He said,
“But what has that to do with it?”</p><p>I said, “It has everything to do with it. Were you not hankering to
be closer to the girls? Tell me the</p><p>truth!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You just go and do whatever you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely natural that boys will write letters and follow
girls, and girls will try to escape. This is just a natural game. The
girl does not want to escape! You just stop chasing her and she will
start chasing you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is continuously happening in my commune. No man is chasing
women, the women are chasing men, because the number of men is less, and
the number of women is more. And it is perfectly natural – the girl
escaping from the boy is simply becoming more attractive to him,
becoming a challenge to him.</p><p><br></p><p>You will never be interested in a woman who is chasing you, if you
are a man, because she is not a challenge. Man loves challenge; it is a
hide-and-seek game. But it is natural, and whatever is natural is
virtue; whatever is unnatural is criminal.</p><p>And I can say all these things to you because I don’t claim any
extraordinariness about myself. I am a simple, ordinary, natural human
being. Perhaps this is the first time any enlightened man has had the
courage to say that he is just ordinary, simple, natural.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand me, what I am saying I am saying, with me begins a
new era in enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU, AND I FEEL THE ANSWERS
WITHIN ME TOO. BUT THE ANSWERS THAT I FEEL DO NOT HELP ME. WHY IS IT
SO?</p><p>Because they are not answers! Are you stupid or something? If they
don’t help you, and the question</p><p>remains, you have some nerve to call them answers. Forget those
answers, they are not.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you find the answer to your question, the question
dissolves, the problem disappears. This is the criterion to judge
whether it was an answer or not.</p><p>But the man who has asked the question must be very egoistic. He
says, “I have many questions that I want to ask; I have my own answers
but they don’t help.” They will never help. Please ask your
questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And you cannot have many questions either. That is an exaggeration.
These are the ways of the ego:</p><p>“I have many questions, and I also have all the answers.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the ego is just like a balloon: if you go on filling it with air,
there comes a moment when it bursts. Today, that moment has come.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM HAPPY TO BE FREE FROM ANY GOD, AND TO BE LIVING MORE AND MORE ON
MY OWN AUTHORITY. BUT NOW I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS ALL
ABOUT. ISN’T IT JUST ANOTHER GOD?</p><p>It seems to be the same stupid man. How do you know that there is no
God – because I have said it? But when did I say it to you, “Believe in
me”?</p><p><br></p><p>You must be enjoying great egoism: “I am free of God.” You are not
free even of your ego, how can you be free of God? How do you manage to
know that there is no God? One can know this only after enlightenment,
because then the whole existence is crystal-clear, open; life is there,
but there is no God anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Because you started with a belief – hearing me say again and again
that there is no God – you felt good, because if there is no God then
you are free to do anything. When I am saying there is no God, I am not
freeing you from responsibility. In fact, when there is no God you
become totally responsible for every act. If there is a God you can
commit a sin and then just go and confess to the priest, and you are
forgiven. But if there is no God, nobody can forgive you; you will have
to undo what you have done. Your responsibility is tremendous. You
cannot pray for any help – no help will be coming.</p><p>The religions have kept man in this idiotic situation because on the
one hand they say, “Don’t do this” – and they know perfectly well you
will do it, it is natural. Then they give you the medicine for it: you
can confess. Or you can go to a holy river and take a dip in it and all
your sins will be washed away. Or chant a mantra every day, do
transcendental meditation – which is neither transcendental nor
meditation – and you will always be clean, forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>God is looking after you, he is holding your hand in his hand. All
this has kept you crippled; you have not been able to walk on your own
feet. And you have not been able to see what you are doing, why you are
doing it. Is it right? Is it confirmed by your consciousness, your
awareness?</p><p><br></p><p>A man of awareness never repents, because a man of awareness does
only things that can done with full consciousness. But Jesus goes on
telling Christians, “Repent! Repent! The day of judgment is coming
soon.” He does not teach people a life of non-repentance – and that’s
what I teach you.</p><p>Be alert, be conscious. Don’t go against nature. Don’t try to swim
against the current, go with the river. Be in a let-go. Accept anything
that arises naturally in you. And you will not need any repentance, any
prayer, any God.</p><p>You say you are freed from God and you are enjoying it. You are
enjoying only a licentiousness; it is not freedom. Freedom is
responsibility.</p><p>A slave need not be responsible, his master is responsible. In fact,
I say to all the religions of the world, “You need not be worried. When
you face God tell him, ‘It is you who created us in this way, with these
instincts. We are not responsible. Why should we repent, and why should
we pray? You should repent for this creation, and you should ask
forgiveness from us. This is a day of judgment!’”</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t know that there is no God. You are not freed from God,
you just have another belief.</p><p>And I go on saying to you: Don’t believe in me!</p><p>I am not creating a faith.</p><p><br></p><p>I am giving you a science.</p><p><br></p><p>Enquire, search – and find. If you had found that there is no God,
then your question would not be there: “What about enlightenment?” That
would have happened before. You could not have asked, “Is not
enlightenment another God?” because you would have known yourself that
enlightenment is not a god, but it is absolute godliness. And remember
the difference: God is a person, godliness is a quality.</p><p>Godliness is the fragrance of the man who has attained enlightenment.
Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU SAYTHATJESUS WAS NOTA HEALER, YET MY PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE IS THAT YOU ARE. CAN YOU COMMENT? ALSO, IS THIS A RELIGIOUS
MATTER?</p><p>You must be kidding! Me, a healer? I am suffering from so many
sicknesses myself – and I touch myself so many times in the day! The
diabetes remains, my asthma remains. Just because of your holy
scriptures that I have been reading for forty years continuously... they
have destroyed my eyes. And I have found nothing in them – sheer
garbage, to be burned.</p><p>Godliness is a totally different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot worship it, you cannot pray to it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not the beginning of your religion, it is the very end, the
flowering. It is a quality of the man of enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s8>9</span></p><p><br></p><p>Be kind to yourself, stop all this seeking</p><p><br></p><p>7 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MEDITATOR AND THE LOVER HAVE
DIFFERENT PATHS. THE OTHER DAY WE HEARD YOUR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION OF
THE PATH OF MEDITATION. IS THIS PATH DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE LOVER?
IF SO, HOW TO TELL WHICH PATH TO CHOOSE?</p><p>There is no path – either of meditation or of love – because a path
leads to some goal. There is no goal in life. What you are searching and
seeking is already present within you.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be understood is: there is no path to truth.
There has never been, there is no possibility of there ever being – for
the simple reason that every path leads you somewhere else, farther and
farther away from yourself. If you are going somewhere a path is needed,
but you are not going anywhere. You have gone so long already, so far
already, from yourself. You have to drop all paths altogether.</p><p>Drop the path and it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Seek, and ye shall find.” I say unto you: Stop seeking
and you have found it. Jesus says, “Ask, and it shall be given.”
Nonsense! Who is there to give it to you? And a truth that is given can
be taken away any moment. It is worth nothing; it is against the dignity
of human individuality. And why ask anybody?</p><p><br></p><p>Stop asking, begging, praying; you are just being stupid. You are it!
In each of your breaths it is here – I will not say “there.” There is no
distance between you and the truth. I say unto you, stop asking,
begging, praying, and you will be surprised that it was the asking,
begging and praying that was preventing you from finding it.</p><p>Jesus says, “Knock, and the doors shall be opened unto you.” The
doors are already open! Where are you going to knock? And if you manage
to knock, you must be knocking your head against some wall. The doors
have never been closed.</p><p>And that is the beauty of existence: it is always open, available –
just for you to take. Existence will not respond to your questions; it
responds only to your silence. And knocking is making noise, beware of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you see a simple thing? You are alive, and life is truth. And
out of this life many flowers blossom; out of this life grows love, out
of this life grows laughter. You are not to seek life. You have been
seeking it for millions and millions of years. It is time: be kind to
yourself, stop all this seeking. The moment a person stops seeking,
asking, knocking, he is where he always wanted to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was a carpenter, so the word “knocking” comes very easily to
him. I cannot say that because I know, the door is open. Your eyes are
closed. Are you going to knock on your eyes? Then you will go blind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see, the door is open.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are not outside, you are inside.</p><p>All the religions have been teaching you that you are outside the
kingdom of God. You are not, you are the kingdom of God, you are in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever the biblical story says, that God threw Adam and Eve out
of paradise, I categorically contradict it. He cannot throw out Adam and
Eve, because there is no place outside paradise. This whole existence is
paradise – infinite in every direction. Where can you be thrown?
Wherever you will be, you will be in; you cannot be out. There is no
“out” in existence, all is in.</p><p><br></p><p>You say this is your understanding, that there are two paths, the
paths of love and meditation. Understanding knows only one. It is
misunderstanding that knows the two and the many. It is not your
understanding that I have been speaking on the path of meditation. These
are simply words. Call it love, call it meditation, or invent your own
word, because all words are invented. The words don’t mean anything;
they mean what you want them to mean.</p><p>You have not understood what I have been saying to you. I have been
saying to you, “Drop all effort and you will be full of meditativeness.”
And meditativeness cannot be anything other than love. When you are full
of meditativeness, it means you are at the very center of your being.
The experiencing of the very center of your being starts blossoming into
love, into laughter, into a song, into a dance.</p><p>Just remain at your center. And when I say remain at your center, I
am saying that you have not moved from it; you are only dreaming that
you have moved. Renounce only one thing in life I</p><p><br></p><p>do not tell you to renounce the world, to renounce the family, to
renounce the wealth, no; all this is nonsense. Religion is not
renouncing, religion is rejoicing.</p><p>Rejoice in the world, rejoice in your family; rejoice in all that is
available to you. Rejoice simply because so much has been given by
nature to you. And in this rejoicing can you think of hatred, of anger,
of negativity, of any dark holes? When you are at your very center,
everything is light, everything is love, everything is as it should be.
You are not to do anything. This is the most difficult thing, to stop
doing anything.</p><p>Have you not seen a dead body floating in the water? When you are
alive, if you don’t know swimming you will go down into the water till
you die. Strange, the dead body knows some secret which you have
forgotten. You cannot drown a dead body. Not that the dead body knows
swimming; the dead body has stopped doing everything, swimming included.
And suddenly a miracle: the dead body is floating on the water.</p><p><br></p><p>People who drown get drowned not by the water. It is a scientific
truth that just as the earth has gravitation – it pulls things
downwards... water is just the opposite. Its law is not gravitation, its
law is levitation; it raises things up. That’s why in water you feel
light; in water you can lift a big rock very easily. The same rock you
may not be able to lift outside the water, because the water – the
levitation – is helping you. The person drowns not because he does not
know swimming; he drowns because he makes so much effort to remain above
water. That very effort exhausts him.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t know swimming, and by chance you fall into water, just
get drowned without any effort. Just go immediately to the very bottom,
and you will be lifted up by the water itself. Swimming is absolutely
unnecessary.</p><p>A Japanese scientist has been working on swimming. He started
teaching six-month-old babies swimming – must be mad! But he succeeded,
because six-month-old babies don’t make much effort. Then he went even
to three-month-old babies; they were even more successful, they simply
floated. They don’t know how to swim, how to make an effort to survive.
They don’t take water as the enemy who is going to drown you, they are
utterly innocent – and for a simple reason: they have a trust. In their
mother’s womb they were swimming in water for nine months – not
swimming, just floating.</p><p><br></p><p>That Japanese scientist is convinced, and I think his conviction is
going to prove right, that even a just-born baby can be left in water
and he will float. He has been floating for nine months.</p><p>Going to your center is just like that. You have been at your center,
not only for nine months, but perhaps for nine million lives. But you go
on making hectic efforts in all directions – searching, seeking,
becoming Christian, becoming Hindu, reading the VEDAS and THE BIBLE and
the KORAN. Naturally you prove to be a crackpot; you are going to end up
insane.</p><p><br></p><p>So please don’t say that you have the understanding – you don’t have
it. Yes, you have a</p><p>misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>I have not been talking about any path. I have been talking about
pathlessness. Meditation is my word for pathlessness. I have not called
it love, because then there is more possibility of your</p><p><br></p><p>misunderstanding. I know your love. You will immediately translate my
word into your kind of love – which is not love at all. It may be
chemistry, it may be hormones, it may be physiology, it may be biology,
but not love.</p><p>You are attracted to a woman or to a man; you think you are in love.
You are unaware of the fact that it is your hormones, your chemistry,
your biology. Just very easily your hormones can be changed, and all
your love for the woman will disappear. Your chemistry can be changed,
and a man can become a woman, a woman can become a man. The difference
between a man and woman is not much.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very simple. It is just like your pocket: pull it out, it
becomes man; push it back into its place, it becomes woman. No other
difference. Your sexuality is hanging out; their sexuality is hanging
in. And you call it love?</p><p>Have you seen animals making love? You must have seen them. Do you
remember? – when they are making love they don’t look happy. They are
not so foolish. They look as if they have been forced to make love.
Their faces show a certain kind of despair: “What is this all about? Why
am I being forced?” Look at two dogs making love – both in great
trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not different for man either. It is this fact that makes people
want to love each other in darkness. It is good: you don’t see the face
of your woman, what is happening to her; she is going into convulsions.
The woman cannot see your face, because your face has turned into a
monster. Next time you are making love, just see the truth of what I am
saying. And you are not the one who is doing it – something is forcing
you to do it. It is something surrounding you, but it is not you; it is
your body, your biology.</p><p><br></p><p>I know about one spider – they also make love; in this world it seems
everybody makes love – and while the male spider on top of the female
spider is just coming to orgasm, is trembling, the female spider starts
eating him. By the time his orgasm is finished, he is also finished.
Great love! And they are doing the same thing you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why married men and women cannot live together in peace –
their love does not allow them to live in peace. Soon they become
prisoners for each other, torturers for each other. It is because of
this fact that I have not used the word “love” for this
pathlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>But once you are at your center, that means you are no longer your
biology, you are no longer your physiology, you are no longer your
hormones. You are just pure awareness, a witness, a small light, a flame
inside, of consciousness. Meditation seems to be a better word, because
you are not acquainted with it. But you can call it love if you are
alert enough not to get mixed up.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of meditation, there is a fragrance which is not chemical, which
is not like passing through a hospital. That fragrance is love. It is
not directed towards some particular address, it is not directed to some
person. Do you think when a flower opens up and sends its fragrance to
the winds, that fragrance is directed to some person? No, it is just
overflowing. Anybody passing by can enjoy it. I say, anybody passing by
can be overwhelmed by it. True love is just like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever I use the word “love,” this is my meaning: it is a fragrance
of the flower of meditation,</p><p>unaddressed. It is not a relationship. Yes, it may relate if somebody
happens to be there. If nobody</p><p><br></p><p>happens to be there, there is no despair; the flower is enjoying its
overflowing energy, it is blessed. It has given its treasure to the
whole existence.</p><p>Yes, it is relating in a way, but it is relating to the whole. It is
not that it will keep its fragrance and wait for the person whom it
loves. That’s what you have been doing, because you don’t know the
authentic quality of love. You are making it a relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody attracts you; there can be any reason for that attraction.
Mostly – perhaps one hundred percent, not mostly – the woman you are
attracted to has something in her eyes, in the color of her hair, in her
way of talking, in her voice, in her gestures, the way she walks...
something in her resembles your mother. You are always in love with your
mother, and your whole life you are seeking another mother. Of course,
you are going to be frustrated.</p><p>All lovers are frustrated, except those who never manage to get
married. For example, Laila and Majnu – the society did not allow them.
Shiri and Fariad – their families came in. They were never frustrated,
they remained lovers their whole life. They lived loving the other
person, they died loving the other person. But if you come together.…
They were prevented from coming together. If you come together you are
going to find that this woman is not your mother.</p><p>Now, it is a very complicated phenomenon. You cannot get married to
your actual mother, or your actual father, but that’s what your biology
is seeking. It never finds it. People go on changing their lovers, and
each lover frustrates more, because by and by they start becoming aware
that this search is never going to end. You can have all the women of
the world or all the men of the world; still you will not be contented.
In fact, you will be the most frustrated human being ever, because you
have known all the women – now there is no hope.</p><p><br></p><p>All the old societies insist on monogamy. They are trying to prevent
you from getting too frustrated. In India you will not find so much
frustration as you will find in America; it is just out of the question.
You are married to a woman – this life is finished. If you want to
search for another, then wait for another incarnation, but in this life
there is no chance. People get settled, not out of joy, it is a
compromise – what else to do?</p><p><br></p><p>But in California you can never get settled. There are other women
around you, other men around you. Perhaps if this woman has failed,
there must be some woman who is born just for you; it is only a question
of finding her. The poets have given you that idea that every man is
born for a certain woman. And when they meet for the first time, lovers
usually say, “We are made for each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is made for each other, and it will not take long to discover
that you were wrong. As your honeymoon ends, you know perfectly well,
one thing is certain: you were not made for each other. No woman can be
exactly like your mother, no man can be exactly like your father. In
this world, everything is unique; you cannot find the same person again.
But every small girl loves her father, every small boy loves his
mother.</p><p>In a way it seems natural, but this is one of the basic causes of
human misery. Later on, what are you going to do? That first imprint of
his mother in a vulnerable child’s mind is going to haunt him for his
whole life. Yes, fragments he may find here and there: the color of the
hair, the color of the eyes, the sound of the voice. But a fragment is
not the whole, and you are searching for the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not love. This is biology intending to propagate; it is a
strategy, a trick. Just think of one thing: if there is no joy in making
love, no attraction in making love, no desire for making love, will you
fall in love with somebody? Then I think that, just like a death
sentence, in the courts they will give a “love sentence”: “You get
married and suffer, this is your punishment.”</p><p>But whether courts do it or not, it has been happening for millennia.
Since man has come into existence it must have been going on. No court
is needed to give you a love sentence, you have given it to yourself.
That’s why I avoid the word “love”; it has very ugly connotations.</p><p>If you try to understand, then there is a totally different kind of
love. But that happens only when you have found your center. Finding the
center is easy. Just not doing anything to find it is difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to convince you that enlightenment is a moment when
you are not doing anything – the doer is absent. That’s why I call
myself the lazy man’s guide for enlightenment. It is not work, it is
play, relaxation.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I’M AFRAID THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO END BEFORE I GET ENLIGHTENED.
WHAT CAN I DO?</p><p>You seem to be very much in a hurry. If you understand me, there is
no problem – right now you can become enlightened. At least right now
the world has not ended. There are thousands of people in the world
trying for enlightenment, but their very trying is the barrier. It
postpones enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>For ninety years J. Krishnamurti has been working, first upon
himself, then upon others. And now he is getting immensely frustrated.
Nobody is to be blamed, he himself has made it a difficult job. He is
obsessed with reading detective novels; he has made the search for
enlightenment a very sensational, puzzling, difficult detective story.
My Krishnamurti Lake is doing far better: just the other day somebody
became enlightened there.</p><p>You are asking me, “The world is going to end, what am I supposed to
do?” Have I to answer you? Can’t you understand? Krishnamurti Lake is
not far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti himself will not help you. He has been just on the
border of enlightenment. One step more... but that one step is missing.
And the reason is that he was forced to become enlightened. For
twenty-five years in his early life The theosophical idiots found him.
He was nine years old, the son</p><p>of a poor, very poor father; the mother had died, he had one brother.
The father was in much difficulty. He was just a small clerk in some
office; to look after these two children, and do the work – it was
becoming maddening.</p><p>So when the Theosophists told him they would like to adopt his two
children – one was Nityananda and the other was Krishnamurti – he
happily handed over the children to Annie Besant, knowing that at least
they would be taken care of, given a good education. The theosophical
movement in those days was the top movement of the world. Very
important, significant, powerful people had become involved in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Theosophists started making these two poor boys enlightened – it
had never been done before... so much hammering that Nityananda died. My
feeling is that the Theosophists were responsible for his death. They
tortured these two boys as much as possible: wake up in the morning at
three o’clock; go to the river, take a cold bath, then chant mantras...
spiritual teaching that went on deep into the night. Both escaped them
finally, because it was absolutely inhuman – Nityananda in one way,
Krishnamurti in another. Nityananda died – he must have been of a weaker
constitution. Krishnamurti survived.</p><p>The Theosophists were going to declare Krishnamurti the world
teacher. When he was twenty-five they gathered in Holland to declare him
the world teacher, with great hope: “The man who can deliver the whole
world from misery has arrived. He is the Christ, he is the Buddha; he
contains all the hopes of the past humanity.”</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti stood up to declare himself to be the world teacher, but
on the contrary, he simply said, “I am nobody’s teacher. I am fed up
with teachers! And just forgive me, I am not jagadguru, the world
teacher. And I dissolve this whole organization that you have created
around me.” A special organization called The Star of the East, a branch
of the Theosophical Society, was created for Krishnamurti. He dissolved
the organization. The people were simply shocked; they had worked so
hard to make him enlightened, and this man freaked out at the crucial
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then he has been going around the earth alone. But those
twenty-five years are still heavy on him; that’s why he cannot take that
one step. He is not freed from those dead Theosophists. They are long
dead, the movement has almost disappeared, but what happened in those
twenty-five years in the beginning is holding him back.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always: love is an attachment; hate is a bigger attachment,
far more solid. Compassion is very delicate, but cruelty is very
hard.</p><p>He is still fighting with the ghosts of the Theosophists. All his
life he has been fighting and fighting with those ghosts – who are dead,
there is no need to fight with them. One should be simply free of them,
but being free means you don’t hate them. Hate imprisons you.</p><p><br></p><p>He has become so afraid of the master and disciple phenomenon.… It is
his experience – I can forgive him, I can understand him. What happened
to him through his masters was so ugly that he has been teaching
everybody that you don’t need any master.</p><p>This is a contradiction. If they don’t need any master, why are you
bothering them? Who are you? You have assumed, unknowingly, the role of
a master, of a teacher. What have you been doing for ninety years? –
teaching people: Beware of teachers! If the people had really understood
you, they would have left you, because, “What is the need? Why should we
listen to you? This is what a teacher and a student, a master and a
disciple do.” The master knows, the disciple does not know. The master
imparts his knowledge to the disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti has been doing that, and I am amazed how blind people
are. They don’t say to him, “Shut up! If we don’t need any master, then
who are you to bother us? For ninety years you have been bothering
people, and not a single person has become enlightened out of this whole
effort.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has created a different kind of effort: “Don’t make effort, don’t
accept any master, don’t be open to any teaching.” All kinds of egoists
have surrounded him for all these years, because the egoist feels great
that he need not be open, he need not listen, he need not be concerned
about masters and teachers; he is enough unto himself.</p><p>It is true, you are enough unto yourself, but you don’t know it!
Somebody has to hammer it on your head. But things can backfire. That’s
what has happened in Krishnamurti’s case: a man of tremendous
intelligence, fighting with ghosts, and continuing teaching, telling
people there is no master, telling people, “You are enough unto
yourself” – this can be misunderstood.</p><p><br></p><p>You are enough unto yourself if you relax and settle in your being;
otherwise you are the greatest enemy of yourself. If you go on making an
effort to become enlightened And man is so strange: if</p><p>you tell him that no effort is needed, he starts making “no
effort”!</p><p>Krishnamurti has never criticized any individual by name. Although he
has criticized principles, doctrines, he has not criticized Gautam
Buddha, Jesus Christ, Moses, Mohammed. Just the other day I received the
information that he has criticized me. This is great! He has always
pretended that it is not worth his while to criticize Jesus, Mohammed,
Mahavira; it is something below him. That attitude is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>But he could not restrain himself about me, for the simple reason
that I have told my sannyasins, “Wherever he is, just go and sit in the
front line.” And you ask me why I have chosen red clothes for you?</p><p><br></p><p>The color red has something mysterious about it – just show a red
flag to a bull and you will know. You can show a blue flag, nothing will
happen; a green flag, nothing will happen. But show a red flag to a bull
and he will rush towards you to kill you. Krishnamurti must have been a
bull in his past life. The moment he sees my red people he forgets all
his philosophy, he starts immediately criticizing me. But this is the
first time he has used my name.</p><p>And what criticism has he given? – very childish. He has said against
me that I am convincing people that enlightenment is their sheer
inheritance, it is a gift of existence – just as life is a gift. I have
always respected Krishnamurti, his intelligence, his courage to dissolve
a great organization. But I cannot help it, I have to say the truth to
you: he is just on the borderline, he is not yet enlightened. He can be
any moment.</p><p>You should not be afraid of the third world war. For you there is
enough time. But he is ninety; for him there is not much time. He should
come to Krishnamurti Lake and get enlightened!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I’M CONFUSED HEARING YOU SAY THERE IS NO GOD. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS IN MY LIFE WHEN I FEEL SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH ME
WHICH I KNOW IS NOT ME. I USED TO CALL IT GOD, NOW I CALL IT GODLINESS.
BUT I STILL DON’T LIKE HEARING THAT THERE IS NO GOD. CAN YOU EASE MY
CONFUSION?</p><p><br></p><p>Baby, my whole work is to confuse you! Unless you are utterly
confused, you are not going to drop your knowledgeability. What do you
mean when you ask me to “ease your confusion”? In other words, you want
certain, settled knowledgeability. You want to convince yourself that
you know it. I cannot commit that crime. You do not know it.</p><p>So first I have to remove all your knowledge – which is bogus anyway.
You have not earned it, you don’t deserve it. It has not grown within
you, it is all rubbish that you have collected from books, from
people.</p><p>I am going to confuse you more and more. And look, what is your
confusion? You say that there have been moments in your life which you
used to call God – you cannot deceive me. I know you may have
experienced a few beautiful moments; everybody experiences a few
beautiful moments of well-being, of great uplift.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing a sunset, suddenly you are silent. Or listening to the tidal
waves of the ocean shattering on the rocks on the shore, suddenly you
feel almost a nobody before this vast existence. Looking into the sky
and the stars you may have had certain moments, and you may have called
them God. Don’t make God so cheap. I am raising God higher than he has
ever been.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jewish God says, “I am a jealous God. I am a very angry God. I am
not nice, I am not your uncle.” Jesus tried to raise the Jewish God, and
that was his crime. He said, “God is love.” Now, this is very
contradictory. The Jewish God says, “I am jealous, I am angry, I am not
nice,” and Jesus makes him a goody-goody: “God is love.”</p><p><br></p><p>This man Jesus should be removed before he destroys their certainty
that God is jealous, angry. You have to be afraid of him, because that
will keep you on the right path. If God is love, then who bothers what
is right and what is wrong? A loving God cannot punish you in hell for
eternity.</p><p>But Jesus on the one hand says, “God is love,” and on the other hand
– he is a Jew after all – the eternal hell remains. He cannot see a
simple fact, that if God is love then eternal hell should be removed –
because you need not be afraid of love. Love gives you freedom to be
yourself;sandwiched between heaven and hell you cannot have any freedom,
any individuality.</p><p>I am trying to raise God. When I say there is no God, I mean there is
no person as God, there is no personality as God.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand clearly that personality is something false.
The word “personality” comes from the Greek persona – persona means a
mask; in Greek drama the actors used to have a mask. You know sona means
sound; a sound coming through a mask was called persona. You cannot see
who is behind the mask; hence the actor has a personality. And if you
all have personalities, you are all actors – you are not being
authentic, sincerely yourself. Personality and individuality don’t mean
the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I am taking the personality of God away. I don’t want him to be an
actor – you have so many in Hollywood. Strange, that the place is called
“Hollywood”... all gods, personalities, great personalities. I don’t
want God to be a Hollywood actor. I am trying to destroy his mask, and
once the personality drops what is left is godliness. That is the true
individuality of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not say, “God is love,” because that still keeps God as a
person. On the contrary, I say, “Love is God.” You can forget all about
God. If you can understand love, that’s enough religion; more than that
is not needed.</p><p>I use the word “godliness” and you are confused, because those
moments... have you seen anybody in those moments that you can call God?
You have not seen anybody in those moments, because there is nobody. You
were using a wrong word, I am correcting you. Those moments you can call
moments of godliness. I am changing God from a quantity to a
quality.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a quantity; godliness is a quality. And you are confused by
it? Just a hangover. Shake yourself well – slap yourself and shake
yourself – and all confusion will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHERE IS THIS MOMENT? I KEEP LOSING IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Here!</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, “Where is this moment?” Your question implies it must be
somewhere else. You have already lost it. It is always here! Don’t try
to find where it is, because while you are finding where it is, you are
losing it. You are missing the train continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>Time knows no tenses: past, present, future, no – absolutely no! Time
knows only one tense, and that is now. It is always now. But your mind
can carry the past and destroy the beauty of the now. Your mind can
project the future, and can lose the precious moment.</p><p>Please, start relaxing here and now. This is the taste of it.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s9>1 0</span></p><p><br></p><p>Blessed are the rich</p><p><br></p><p>8 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CLERGYMAN OLDS GRANDLUND FROM SWEDEN HAS ASKED YOU A QUESTION. THE
QUESTION HAS MANY QUESTIONS, SO I HAVE SEPARATED THEM. HE SAYS, “BELOVED
OSHO, I HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT
ABOUT MOTHER TERESA.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus!</p><p>Jesus used to teach his disciples, particularly the two fishermen who
became his first disciples, how to catch men instead of catching fish. I
teach my people how to catch clergymen, instead of catching simply men
and women. This is going to be a great feast. We are not cannibals,
otherwise we would have tasted Christianity, but still, some vegetable
salad can be made.</p><p>I have heard a small story In a school the teacher was telling the
little boys and girls how God</p><p>created the world, man, woman, and how he created these two sexes in
trees, in birds, in animals. And when she was telling all this – that
there are two sexes, man and woman – a small boy stood up. He said, “No!
There are three sexes: man, woman and clergyman.” It is a totally
different species.</p><p><br></p><p>I have read his letter – it is so long, many questions in it. Start
asking them one by one.</p><p>I MEAN THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN DOWN IN THE SAME PIT, HOLLOW, LIKE OTHER
GREAT MASTERS AND LEADERS, TO TELL BULLSHIT ABOUT OTHERS. 2 2</p><p><br></p><p>First, he was sad because I criticized Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa
wrote to me saying that she prays for me every day, and asks God to
forgive me. Now, this is an absolute trespass.</p><p>I wrote her back, “Who are you to pray for me? – and to a God who
does not exist at all. And even if he existed, you have no right to pray
for me! I don’t want any interference in my life, in my ways of
thinking. This is violating the freedom of the individual. You stop
praying to God – at least for me. I am perfectly happy, and my happiness
is based on knowing that there is no God, that man is free.”</p><p><br></p><p>God was a monopolist, a fascist, an imperialist; he dominated
everything. If God is there, there is no possibility of freedom; you are
just puppets in his hand. He wants to create you – he creates you; he
wants to destroy you – he destroys you. There is no court of appeal
against him. He is the final and absolute authority. Christianity is an
anti-democratic religion. And all the religions who believe in God are
fascist. They have accepted slavery.</p><p>The clergyman... I don’t know how to address him, Mr. Clergyman or
Mrs. Clergyman – because his sex is neither. So please forgive me, I
will just use the address, clergyman.</p><p>These people are strange – so programmed, so conditioned that they
cannot listen to the truth. I have no enmity with Mother Teresa. But if
she writes to me that she prays to God to forgive me I</p><p>have not committed any sin, I have not committed any crime – why
should I be forgiven? And I have not given her my power of attorney to
pray for me. And if I say this, you are disturbed that I criticized
Mother Teresa.</p><p>This clergyman was leaving yesterday; he had packed, he was so angry.
But then he decided to write all these questions, and decided to listen
to what I am going to say. I think after today it will be difficult for
him to remain one more day.</p><p><br></p><p>Mother Teresa has many orphanages in India. Why in India? Why not in
Christian countries? A simple fact.… Those orphans in India she collects
from the streets – urchins – and then converts them to Catholicism. It
is a politics of numbers. In each of her orphanages there are hundreds
of orphans who are being taught Christianity – Catholicism more
particularly.</p><p><br></p><p>Those orphans are born either of Hindus or Mohammedans; none of them
belong to Christianity. But to increase the numbers of Catholics in the
world – because numbers mean power – she feeds them, clothes them,
provides medical facilities; hence even stupid Hindus and Mohammedans
think she is a saint. She is a sheer, dirty politician.</p><p><br></p><p>One man with his wife, from America, went to Mother Teresa to adopt a
child, because they were childless and the doctors had said that there
was no possibility – physiologically they could not have a child; it
would be better to adopt one. Mother Teresa said, “You can choose. We
have beautiful boys, girls – seven hundred.” But she forgot to ask what
their religion was. She assumed they must be Catholics; only Catholics
come there.</p><p>And as she remembered she had not asked their religion, she asked
them. They said, “We are Protestant Christians.” Now there was a great
silence. She said, “Excuse me. Right now we don’t have one orphan to
give you.” Just a moment before there were seven hundred orphans; now
there is not even a single one. And the man and the woman, the couple,
were neither Mohammedan,</p><p><br></p><p>nor Buddhist, nor Hindu. They were Christians – but they were not
Catholic Christian, they were Protestant Christian.</p><p>They wrote a letter to the newspapers describing the whole story, and
saying, “This is strange. We were turned away, we were not taken in. We
had no idea that those children are only provided for adoption by
Catholics.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I wrote to her, asking, “What is this nonsense? What is going
on?” she tried to convince me that what she had done was right. She
said, “Yes, there were orphans, but because they had been brought up
according to Catholicism, they would not fit into a Protestant
family.”</p><p>Cannot I be allowed to ask her, “Why in the first place have they
been brought up according to Catholicism? They were not born Catholics.
If you want to teach them religion, then the Hindu orphans should be
taught according to Hinduism. If they are Mohammedan, they should be
taught Mohammedanism.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what a poor argument! You can convert a fully grown-up Hindu,
who has lived his whole life as a Hindu, into a Catholic, and there is
no problem. But those small children who have been taught the Catholic
catechism cannot be accepted in a Protestant family which is Christian?
There is not much difference between Protestantism and Catholicism. So
where is the problem?” She stopped writing to me.</p><p><br></p><p>And if I say these things publicly, this poor clergyman is offended.
He wanted to leave. Read the first question again.</p><p>I HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT
ABOUT MOTHER</p><p>TERESA. 3 3</p><p><br></p><p>I like it! And I am going to talk as much bullshit as possible. And
what is wrong with bullshit? It is divine. And all this bullshit will
fall on the clergyman, remember. He will not be able to find his way
back to the church.</p><p>What do I care whether you like it or not? I am not here to convert
you, convince you. And I am not talking to a single religion. Here are
people from all religions, from all countries, all ideologies.</p><p>And if my talking against Mother Teresa hurts you, it is your
problem. It is not hurting anyone else. And why does it hurt? You should
ponder over it. Why does it make you sad? It is your programmed mind.
And my effort is simply deprogramming. So whenever I deprogram a Hindu
he will also think I am talking bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>You should rather contemplate why it hurts you. You are not Mother
Teresa. And whatever I am saying, I am giving you absolutely valid
arguments. If you were really hurt, sad, you should have given arguments
in favor of Mother Teresa. You have not given a single argument in your
long letter. You don’t have any! You cannot deny what I am saying,
that’s what makes you sad. Try to deny it, accept my challenge. It will
help you. Whatever I say, I say with full conviction, and I give you my
argument, why I am saying it.</p><p><br></p><p>To trespass somebody’s garden is illegal, to trespass somebody’s
house is illegal. And she is trespassing my being – praying for me,
giving me no answer. This is her answer – praying for me, to a God in
whom I don’t believe.</p><p>Please try to find something in favor of Mother Teresa.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAYS, “I LOVE JESUS MORE THAN ANYONE.” 4 4</p><p><br></p><p>He also says – you have forgotten – that I have fallen in the same
hollow pit as other great masters and leaders. I am neither a great
master nor a great leader. I am a simple, ordinary man. I don’t want to
be categorized with all those fools.</p><p><br></p><p>Being simple and ordinary has one beauty: you cannot fall. To fall,
one thing is absolutely necessary, that you should be high, great, on
the top of the world. I do not belong to that category. I live a simple,
human life, with all its weaknesses, frailties, mistakes. I cannot fall,
there is nowhere to fall. If you want to fall, first go up a ladder. I
have been walking my whole life on the plain ground.</p><p><br></p><p>This is strange. First you make me a great master, a great leader,
just to make me fall from there. I know enough logic.… From the roots I
cut things. I don’t claim to be great. Only people who are suffering
from an inferiority complex claim to be great masters, great leaders of
men. I don’t have any inferiority complex. I don’t want to be superior
to anybody in the world.</p><p>Whatsoever I am, I am tremendously happy and at ease with it. So
please show me how I can fall. An infallible pope may fall, but I am
fallible, and not a pope. But I cannot fall in his pit. And why does he
say I have fallen in a pit? – because I am “talking bullshit about
Mother Teresa.” Yes, there is a mistake. I should talk cow dung about
Mother Teresa. Bullshit is male; cow dung is female – and she is very
old, dried cow dung.</p><p>And I can say these things because I don’t want any respectability
from anyone. The clergyman will be in a difficulty because he has dealt
with people whom you can exploit by the simple strategy of giving them
respectability. When you give respectability to somebody, he becomes
afraid to say anything that may destroy his respectability.</p><p>I do not care at all what people think about me. I am not dependent
on them. If I hanker for respectability, then certainly I will not say
anything that may destroy my respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to say exactly what is the truth to me. If it brings me
notoriety– it has brought me notoriety in these thirty years – I enjoy
it.</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAYS, “YOU TELL ABOUT JOY, LOVE, LIFE, CELEBRATION, FREEDOM, ET
<span class=s10>CETERA. MY</span> QUESTION JUST NOW IS, CAN YOU FEEL
IT IN YOUR OWN LIFE – REPEATEDLY SHOWING YOURSELF IN ROLLS ROYCES AND
FEMININE CLOTHES, SAYING, REPEATING WORDS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, MOTHER
TERESA ET CETERA, HAVING BODYGUARDS – ANY FREEDOM, CELEBRATION, JOY?” 5
5</p><p>It really amazes me to know that clothes also have genitals! This
clergyman is saying that some clothes are female and some clothes are
male. Mr. Clergyman, are you nuts? Clothes are either comfortable or not
comfortable. I use what is comfortable to me.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, just on the way coming here I enquired about the clergyman
to my secretary: “Has he got a beard and a mustache?”</p><p>She said, “No.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is feminine.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why have you cut your beard and your mustache, which God has created
in you? That’s what so many men have done. Just think of a woman with a
big beard and mustache. And it is not only a mustache and beard.…</p><p>As I have told you, Christianity is the worst of all religions – I
never say anything without supporting it with valid reasons. Before the
communist revolution in Russia, there was a big Christian sect – Russia
was one of the most orthodox Christian countries. The most famous and
the most respected Christians were those who used to cut off their
genitals. Every year men would cut off their genitals, women would cut
off their breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever wrong communism has done in Russia, at least one thing
good they have done: they have stopped these idiots doing such an
utterly insane thing. And this gave those Christians respectability;
they became saints.</p><p>I looked at my dress and I could not find that it is feminine; it is
comfortable, it is beautiful. I am not a soldier who has to be in
clothes so tight that just his tight clothes make him kill somebody, so
tight he just wants to get out of the clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a lazy person. My clothes are nothing – just a loose robe.
Without any effort I can take it off, put it on. And strange, that a
clergyman should indicate to me that this is feminine. I am reminded...
I lived for a few months in a place called Raipur in India; I was a
lecturer at Raipur University. Just near my house two trucks collided
and killed somebody who was crushed so badly that it was impossible to
recognize who it was.</p><p>Somebody came running to me and asked me, “What can be done now? A
woman has been crushed, and she has died.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went there. I said, “Why do you say this is a woman?”</p><p>It was a Mohammedan area where I lived. Mohammedan women wear a black
mask over their face and a black robe over their whole body. You cannot
see a Mohammedan woman’s body. She can see through small holes in front
of her eyes. So they thought that this must be a Mohammedan woman. It
was a man – not a man, a Christian clergyman in his black habit.</p><p>I wonder why Christian clergymen call their dresses habits, black
habits. And why have they chosen the black color when there are so many
beautiful colors? In fact, black is not a color at all. Black is an
absence of all colors.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see a rainbow, there are two colors you will not find there:
black and white. White is a combination of all the seven colors of the
rainbow; it is the richest color. Seven colors meeting and</p><p><br></p><p>merging create the white. And black is not a color, it is the absence
of all seven colors. That’s why down the centuries, around the world,
death has been conceived as black – because it is the absence of life,
the absence of everything.</p><p>Why have Christians chosen the black robe as their habit? They are
not messengers of God on the earth, they are the messengers of death!
Their black robe indicates their intention. They are all Reverend Jim
Joneses; they want to turn this whole earth into a Jonestown.</p><p><br></p><p>He is talking about my clothes. I use all the colors. The rainbow is
my love. I want finally to give all my sannyasins rainbow dresses. I am
waiting for the right time. First I want you, through your red dress, to
be identified: that you are not part of any old, rotten religion, that
you don’t belong to the blind society that surrounds you, that you are
asserting your individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have wondered why I don’t use red – because I don’t want you
to be my imitators. I don’t want anybody to say, “Why do you imitate
Osho?” My seamstresses – Gayan, Veena, Arpita, Ashu – I have told them
to avoid red as far as possible in my clothes. I don’t want you to
imitate me. I don’t want you in any way to lose your individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>The red color is just to shock the outsiders. The color red has some
mysterious quality. Nobody can ignore it; it just hits the eyes. Go in a
red robe anywhere in the world, and everybody will look at you. Even if
you pass people, they will stop and look again: what is the matter with
this man?</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know the meaning of the word “respect”? It is not honour, it
means seeing again – re-spect. The red color creates great respect.</p><p>HE ASKS FURTHER, “AREN’T YOU SPEAKING IN ONE WAY AND LIVING IN
ANOTHER WAY? I FEEL MUCH MORE FREE, JOYFUL THAN YOU, YOUR SANNYASINS –
YES, EVERYONE IN RAJNEESHPURAM. WHEN I SEE YOU, I SEE A PRISONER
IMPRISONED IN YOUR OWN PRISON.” 6 6</p><p><br></p><p>Great! Then why are you here? If you think you are more happy than
me, more blissful than me, more free than me, then what are you doing
here? Why have you been coming here year after year, each celebration?
Are you crazy?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t go anywhere. There is nothing anywhere which can make me
happier. And what criterion are you using? When you say that you are
more blissful than me, there must be some criterion, some way to decide
who is more blissful. A blissful person does not go in search of bliss –
and you are here in search of bliss. Why are you listening to me,
wasting your time? You must be miserable. You want to get rid of that
misery.</p><p>And still you address me as “Beloved Osho.” You don’t know the
meaning of “Osho,” it seems. It means the blessed one. There is no
possibility of being more blissful then the blessed one. Perhaps your
addressing me as “Beloved Osho” is just Christian hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you call me “Beloved.” On what grounds? A man who is talking
bullshit – are you in love with bullshit? A man who is talking against
Mother Teresa and Jesus – are you in some way against Mother Teresa and
Jesus but afraid to say so, because it will go against your vested
interest? You</p><p><br></p><p>are a clergyman – that is your job; you are getting money for it,
respect for it. I am not getting anything, no salary, no money. I don’t
have a single cent with me. I don’t have even pockets in my robe.</p><p>Twenty years ago I told my tailors to drop the pocket. It is
unnecessary, because I don’t have anything to put in the pocket. And for
twenty years I have lived without any money. You cannot find a single
man in the world who has lived twenty years without money. I have not
even touched money for twenty years – not that I am against money. I
have not seen a dollar yet, although for years I have been in America.
And I don’t think there is any possibility for me to see a dollar before
I die.</p><p><br></p><p>You talk about Rolls Royces. I don’t own them. And why do you ask
about Mother Teresa, Jesus Christ, Rolls Royces? Is there some
connection? There is bound to be in your mind. You seem to be jealous,
utterly jealous. I don’t own any Rolls Royces. Those Rolls Royces are
owned by my sannyasins; out of their love they provide a Rolls Royce for
me for one hour every day. I don’t even know which Rolls Royce they are
going to bring today, it is up to them.</p><p>And why have they chosen Rolls Royces for me, just for one hour?
Because my back is bad. They tried all other cars; only the Rolls Royce
seat suits my back. Now what can I do? It is the fault of the Rolls
Royce people. And anyway, I am a man of very simple taste. I am utterly
satisfied with anything which is the best.</p><p><br></p><p>But why should a clergyman be concerned? Poor fellow, he needs a
four-wheeler Ford.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good strategy for me to move in Rolls Royces – and not just
one. I would like the clergyman to burn even more – there are ninety
Rolls Royces. And it is not the end! My sannyasins are trying to have at
least three hundred and sixty-five Rolls Royces, so only once in a year,
for one hour, do I get the the same Rolls Royce. And I know they will be
able to manage, because I am not a poor man’s savior. I am the rich
man’s savior.</p><p><br></p><p>So many people are saving poor people, nobody is looking after the
rich. They are completely ignored. This is inhuman. There are thousands
of saints looking after the welfare of the poor. I am the only one – and
I am not even a saint – who is looking after the welfare of the
rich.</p><p>I will manage, if there is any heaven anywhere – I know there is
none, but just for the argument’s</p><p>sake If there is any heaven anywhere, then a camel may pass through
the eye of a needle, but not a poor man through the gates of heaven.</p><p>A poor man in heaven will look out of place. Only the people who have
lived in luxury will be able to become part of paradise. They are
already disciplined to luxury. If you have never tasted wine and you
enter the Mohammedan paradise, where water is not available and you have
to drink only wine, what will happen to you?</p><p><br></p><p>If you have been celibate, as this clergyman must be pretending –
because all celibacy is pretension, you cannot go against nature And
foolishly he has himself admitted that he has four girlfriends. To</p><p>his congregation he must be a celibate man, and behind the curtains
he has four girlfriends. Are you a Mohammedan, by the way? A poor man
you cannot think of his misery when he finds himself in</p><p>paradise, with everybody singing, “Alleluia! Alleluia!” and doing
nothing, because there is nothing to</p><p>do.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach my people the art of non-doing – that is the preparation for
paradise. I teach my people to</p><p>sing, “Alleluia” – that is the preparation for paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>A poor man will be simply in a foreign land in paradise; he will not
be able to make any connection with the situation that has been depicted
as paradise. Rivers of wine, beautiful girls who always remain young...
and the whole work is just to go on playing on your harp and
singing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard... once it happened to a poor man. The poor man was a
porter in Munich in Germany, drinking as much beer as possible, speaking
language which is not included in dictionaries, fighting for any excuse
– just ready to fight. By some mistake, he entered paradise when he
died. It must have been a mistake – even angels of death are not
infallible. Somebody else was wanted, but they took him there.</p><p>He was so miserable there! He had been a porter on the station, and
he was very happy – the whole day working and then drinking, and then
finding some woman. And doing everything In paradise</p><p>there was nothing. Beer was not available. The women who were
available were so beautiful he was afraid even to approach them. He had
known only prostitutes, poor prostitutes; he had never known those
beautiful prostitutes of paradise.</p><p>He was handed a harp and told, “Sit on a cloud and just say,
‘Alleluia, alleluia.’”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is a strange place. I was far better in my station,
doing my job, waiting for the evening to</p><p>go to the pub, then searching for a woman. This is a strange place.
Sit on a cloud?”</p><p><br></p><p>He had never played on a harp, he had not even seen a harp in his
life. He was so angry, but what else to do? – he started making an
effort to play on a harp. It was not music, he knew nothing of music. He
wanted to punch somebody on the nose. He was looking all around for this
so-called God to ask, “What nonsense is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>In paradise you don’t sleep at all. It is always day, it is always
light. And he was habituated to using his language, so although he used
to sing, “Alleluia, alleluia,” in between he would say, “Fuck you all!”
and again, “Alleluia, alleluia.”</p><p>It was reported to the guard that this man is dangerous. He says
loudly, ‘Alleluia! Alleluia!’ and in between he inserts, ‘Fuck you all!’
He was sent back to Munich. He was so happy you cannot conceive.</p><p><br></p><p>I said to you I am not a saint. To me the word “saint” is more
obscene than “Fuck you all,” because fucking is natural. Everybody is
doing it – even the clergyman. What everybody is doing, how can it be
obscene? When the whole of nature is doing it, how can it be obscene?
When even your God was doing it, what is obscene in it?</p><p><br></p><p>But the word “saint” is obscene. You may not be aware of where it
comes from. It comes from “sanction” – the pope gives the sanction to
somebody, and makes him a saint. This is simply absurd. Who can make me
a saint? I don’t accept anybody’s authority. And a pope giving the
sanction – then sainthood becomes something like a certificate.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to Joan of Arc; Christians burned her alive. Christians
have committed so many sins in the world that if there is any hell, it
will be full of Christians: clergymen, bishops, archbishops, popes,
Jesus Christ.</p><p>Burning living people, and particularly women – it seems to be a
certain psychological revenge, because the priests of Christian
communities were prohibited from any relationship with a woman. They
were really enraged. They wanted to do something to hurt the woman,
because the woman was very attractive. Remember, whenever you are
attracted to somebody immensely, you also feel to destroy that person or
that thing. Why? – because your being attracted to it makes you a
slave.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why men and women cannot live together harmoniously. Both are
attracted to each other, and both are destructive to each other. All
these husbands and wives are continuously fighting, nagging, harming
each other in every possible way. The reason is, they are attracted to
each other. They cannot leave each other, and they cannot live together.
They are in a fix.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest, the clergyman, is in an even more difficult situation.
The woman attracts – attracts him more than anybody else, because others
have some experience of woman and he has none. He would like somehow to
force the woman to be destroyed, because deep in his heart is not Jesus
Christ – it is Mary Magdalene. He goes on repressing Mary Magdalene by
repeating some stupid prayer. But he knows perfectly well she is there,
so he wants to destroy the woman.</p><p>In the Middle Ages, Christians burned thousands of innocent women –
they just had to find an excuse. And the excuse was that the women were
in a conspiracy with the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians have been taught that the woman has been an agent of the
devil from the days of Adam and Eve. The serpent did not approach Adam,
he approached Eve. Since then the woman has been somehow in connection
with the devil. In the Middle Ages the Christians accused thousands of
women of having sexual relationships with the devil: “They are witches,
and they are dangerous to the society. They should be burned.”</p><p>They declared Joan of Arc also a witch. Of course she is one of the
most significant persons who has ever walked on this earth.
Single-handedly she fought for the freedom of her country, and attained
freedom for her country. Certainly it gave the clue to the clergymen
that she must be deriving all her power from the devil; otherwise a
fragile woman, a young woman – how can she be so powerful? This was the
reward that they gave to her: they condemned her as a witch and burned
her alive. This was the judgment of an infallible pope.</p><p><br></p><p>After three hundred years another infallible pope reconsidered the
case – because people were not agreeing with it. It was such an ugly act
in the name of God. You rewarded the woman who brought freedom to the
country by burning her alive? To keep these people on the side of the
church, after three hundred years another infallible pope – remember the
word “infallible” – declared that she is a saint.</p><p>Nobody asks, if both the popes were infallible Then it seems to be
impossible – how are you going</p><p>to manage? One declares her a witch to be burned alive; another
declares, after three hundred years, that she is a saint. Her bones were
dug out from her grave and worshipped.</p><p><br></p><p>Many nuns were burned alive, many priests and monks were burned
alive, but ninety percent of those who were burned alive were women.
Even nuns – they were forced to confess, they were tortured to confess
that they had had intercourse with the devil. Can you see how the mind
becomes perverted when you go against nature? And they were tortured so
much that they had to confess.</p><p>The same tactics have been used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin,
but the whole credit goes to Christianity. Torture a person – there is a
limit, and then the person thinks, that there is no point in being
tortured and again and again with the same question. It is better to
accept it and be finished with it.</p><p><br></p><p>They were tortured and asked, “Have you had any intercourse with the
devil?” Now nobody today can even imagine that there is a devil and
women are having intercourse with him. Of course because the devil is a
man – and he is not a homosexual – that’s why women were tortured. And
they were told, “You have to confess the reality.” Finally they
confessed; and their confessions are very significant to remember. Mr.
Clergyman, please remember what those nuns confessed.</p><p>After the confession they were burned, because they had admitted,
they had confessed that they had had intercourse many times with the
devil. But what was the proof? And Christian priests have been giving
them proof: the proof was that the woman said that the devil has a
forked prick, so that he can enter the woman’s body from both holes.
Great holy people! And the women – thousands in number – confessed. They
were nuns. And they were burned.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the devil has disappeared completely. After Sigmund Freud, he
thought it was better to leave this earth. The few men – monks – who
were burned, were burned because they were making sexual approaches or
contacts with nuns. You call this a religion?</p><p>And if these clergymen, priests, reach heaven, where beautiful men,
beautiful women, are all living in absolute freedom, with no fear of
sin, with no guilt I have not come across a single reference that</p><p>in heaven there are churches, and there are clergymen, and there are
congregations. All that stupidity happens only on this poor earth.</p><p>All the priests of all the religions are looking after the poor,
exploiting them, exploiting their poverty to convert them to their
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>I am taking care of the rich. Blessed are the rich, for theirs is the
kingdom of God. And of course, in heaven you will get a Rolls Royce.
Anything less than that would be a humiliation of paradise, of your God
himself. What do you think – which car does your God use? I think it
must be a Rolls Royce.</p><p><br></p><p>Why is this clergyman so worried about it? It is my problem. If I
have to suffer for being in a Rolls Royce and go to hell, I am perfectly
happy. In fact I don’t want to go to your heaven, because the best
people of the earth will be found in hell, if it is there.</p><p>Where will you find Gautam Buddha? He denied God; he must be in hell.
Where will you find Mahavira? He denied God; he must be in hell. Where
will you find all your great painters, singers, dancers, poets,
musicians? They cannot enter heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>They have committed so much sin in the eyes of the Christian priests,
they must be in hell. You will find all the geniuses in hell – if there
is any hell. Of course, there is none.</p><p>This priest, this clergyman, must have forgotten my watches, thinking
that the letter is becoming too long. But what is the problem? There are
a few people who write to me, but they don’t know at all about my
watches. This is the cheapest watch in the world. These are not
diamonds, these are stones, ordinary stones. It is made by my own
sannyasins, it is not a Piaget. My own sannyasins, Ajito and Bodhi, out
of their love make watches for me.</p><p>And I love everything beautiful. Look at this watch! I don’t make any
difference between a beautiful diamond or a beautiful stone. The
criterion is beauty. Yes, a few of my sannyasins allow me to use real
diamond watches. I have no objection.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jainism, which is one of the most ancient religions of the world,
in their heaven, mountains are made of diamonds, gold, silver. If in
your heaven you can have mountains of diamonds, can’t I have a small
watch? This seems to be absolutely consistent. Be rich, be luxurious, be
comfortable, because whatever you are here, wherever you go you will be
able to adjust to more luxury, to a higher standard of living.</p><p>Don’t listen to these idiot clergymen. If you live in a poor way.…
And that’s what all the religions teach – live in poverty; if you are
not poor you will miss everything after life. I can’t see the logic.
Here you practice poverty.…</p><p><br></p><p>Mahatma Gandhi was practicing poverty. In his ashram even mosquito
nets were not allowed; it is luxurious. And in India everywhere there
are mosquitos, and particularly in Gandhi’s ashram they had a great
gathering – naturally, so much food, so easily available.</p><p><br></p><p>What did Gandhi invent to prevent the mosquitoes? He cannot allow
them to be killed by Flit, because he is a non-violent man, he believes
in non-violence. Mosquitoes are not to be killed, and a mosquito net is
also not good, because it is a luxury. I cannot conceive, a mosquito net
is a luxury? So he told his disciples: “Before you go to sleep, put
kerosene oil on your face, on your hands, or any part of your body that
is exposed.” Kerosene oil.…</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi’s son, Ramdas, used to be my friend. I asked Ramdas,
“If even mosquitoes have enough sensibility not to come close to a
person who is painted with kerosene oil – it stinks, even a mosquito is
not ready, even though he may die without food – what about the man? How
can he sleep with this smell?” But those who did that were great
saints.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know – particularly this clergyman – that in
Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram there was a man, Professor Bhonsali, who lived
for six years eating only bullshit. And he was worshipped like a god. He
had done a great act of austerity – just eating bullshit for six
months.</p><p><br></p><p>This clergyman should try. At least for six days, eat bullshit, and
you will forget all your Mother Teresas and all your Jesuses. And then
you will remember me!</p><p>HE FURTHER STATES, “OSHO, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME PIECES OF HELL AND HEAVEN
HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM.” 7 7</p><p><br></p><p>On one thing I can agree with you: I may have given you pieces of
hell, that is my business. The other part I cannot agree with. I cannot
give you pieces of heaven, you must have been hallucinating.</p><p>I know what is actually the case. Whenever I said something which was
in agreement with his conditioned mind, he felt euphoric. It was not me,
it was your conditioned mind feeling nourished, supported. Those were
the pieces of heaven. And whenever I said something which gave you an
electric shock, of course those were the pieces of hell. You cannot
hallucinate and imagine shocks, electric shocks – that’s why I must have
given them to you.</p><p>You are hallucinating, imagining, projecting heaven. So whenever I
say something which falls in tune with your conditioning, you feel
great. You feel great that you are right, that your religion is right,
that your BIBLE is right.</p><p><br></p><p>You are certain that your religion is right. You are looking for
certainty, for guarantee. And strange – you are more blissful than me,
and you are asking for my authority? I have never asked for anybody’s
authority, I have never asked for anybody’s support. I have simply lived
on my own. I don’t belong to any religion, I don’t belong to any
philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>It simply shows that whenever your belief system is supported, you
will feel good, great; and whenever hammered, you will feel bad. But in
fact, those moments that you feel I have given you of heaven are
poisonous, because they are making you cling more tightly to your
conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>The moments that you call “of hell” are the real thing. Only those
moments, if you are courageous enough, if you have guts – which is very
rare in clergymen, because why should a man who has guts become a
clergyman? – if you have any guts, then forget all those moments of
heaven, and remember those moments of hell. They are going to help
you.</p><p>My work is surgical. I have to cut so much crap which is clinging to
you, and you are clinging to it. It hurts, I know. It hurts. You can
forgive me for hurting you – but don’t forget that this hurting is being
caused by your clinging.</p><p>If you really listen to me, and you see that something is so and drop
it instantly, you will not feel any pieces of hell, moments of hell. And
the moment you drop all that is painful to part with, a new phenomenon
will happen to you. The moments of hell disappearing will make you able
to see that your moments of heaven are only hallucination. You have been
drugged from your very childhood. All religions are nothing but opium.
And if you can drop both, you will be free for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying that you are more free than me, you are more free than
my sannyasins in Rajneeshpuram. Don’t befool yourself. You say that I
live in a prison. I don’t live in a prison. Yes, I live in my room
almost the whole day. But the reason why I live there is because the
world outside has nothing more to offer to me. And the world inside me
is so rich, so overflowingly rich, that I need not go looking outside.
Yes, roses are beautiful, but inside me I have seen bigger, more alive,
more fragrant roses blooming. Now, what do you suppose I should do?</p><p><br></p><p>I am the freest man in the whole history of humanity. It is out of my
freedom that I am inside my room. Nobody is preventing me. On the
contrary, my personal physicians, Devaraj and Shunyo; my caretaker,
Vivek; my secretary – they are all trying to get me somehow to go
out.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying here for you to go in!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there are guards around me, because I am not a suicidal person.
I am not as suicidal as your Jesus Christ was. He had absolute knowledge
that that day he was going to be caught. What was the need for him to go
to Jerusalem, unless he was attracted towards death? He had a very great
death instinct in him. I don’t have any suicidal instinct in me. Both
things disappeared together: the desire for eternal life and the desire
to commit suicide. They are two sides of the same coin. I threw away
that coin thirty-two years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Those guards around me are not placed by me but by my people. You
have to remember that I must be the most fortunate person to have so
many intelligent people around me. Just look at who Jesus had:
fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters. He had only one man, Judas,
who was a little literate and a little intelligent; otherwise, those
so-called apostles needed adult education.</p><p>I am here to share myself with you. I have no concern with the moment
that has passed, and I have no concern for the moment that is coming.
But my people would certainly like me to be with them as long as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It is their arrangement. Not only have they arranged the guards, they
have arranged every medical facility in my house, every surgical
facility in my house. Any moment, if anything happens, they don’t want
to lose time taking me to Portland or to Bend or to Redmond. And I never
interfere with anybody. If this is their joy, they should do it.</p><p>Who am I to interfere? If somebody wants to kill me, I will not
interfere even in that. But if somebody wants to save me, do you want me
to interfere in it? And these guards have done no harm to anybody in
four years. They are just standing there as a precaution. And it is not
me who is responsible for them standing there. But my people are free to
do anything they want to do for me.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been beautiful if Jesus had also had some intelligent
people around him. Only Judas was a little intelligent, and he betrayed.
Perhaps he did well, because he must have seen this suicidal instinct in
Jesus. He must have seen that Jesus wanted to be a martyr, he was not
going to listen to anybody. He wanted to be on the cross, because by his
teachings he had not been able to convert the Jews to Christianity. He
was hoping, perhaps, that what he had not been able to do, his
martyrdom, his crucifixion may do. And he was right – it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no Christianity in the world; it is only “crossianity.” The
cross made a great impact, aroused sympathy towards him, just as my Roll
Royces and my watches arouse in you jealousy, my clothes create
jealousy. But if I was hanging on a cross, then this clergyman would
have been at my feet praying to God.</p><p>It is strange but true, that you are sympathetic to misery, to
poverty, to sickness, to death. Have you ever thought what it means? You
are never sympathetic with somebody who is blissful, happy, joyous,
dancing, singing, has no worry at all, no tension. Have you felt any
sympathy with that man? Have you gone to that man and said, “I have
great sympathy for you”? You would look foolish. He does not need your
sympathy in the first place. In the second place, his being in a
blissful state creates jealousy in you, not sympathy.</p><p><br></p><p>The crucifixion of Jesus created great sympathy, and out of that
sympathy was born this whole cancer of Christianity.</p><p>I am not asking for your sympathy; otherwise I would be carrying my
cross on my shoulders. I do not care, because to ask for your sympathy
simply means that I am empty within, that I want to fill that empty
hollowness through your sympathy, your love, your compassion. No.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do people get angry with me? Why do they become arrogant,
aggressive towards me? The reason is simple. I am so blissful that only
great jealousy starts burning in their hearts. You have never loved
anybody who is going higher and higher in his happiness.</p><p>If your house is on fire, even your enemies will come to sympathize
with you, even those who were not on talking terms with you. But if you
make a beautiful marble palace, even your friends will disappear. The
jealousy That jealousy is all over the letter of the clergyman.</p><p><br></p><p>FINALLY HE SAYS, “BLESSINGS.” 8 8</p><p><br></p><p>Please forgive me, I cannot accept it. I have so much blessedness in
me, I am just blissed-out. What am I going to do with a poor man’s
blessings? And what blessings can you give to me? You don’t have them in
the first place to give. This is simply egoistic stupidity.</p><p>You should have asked for my blessings. I have them and I can give
them to you, or to anybody. In fact, I am simply throwing them to
everybody!</p><p><br></p><p>Please forgive me, this clergyman destroyed your whole morning.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s9>1 1</span></p><p><br></p><p>That explosion of bliss</p><p><br></p><p>9 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>J. KRISHNAMURTI HAS CRITICIZED YOU AND SAID THAT YOU ARE A
SELF-APPOINTED MASTER. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?</p><p>It seems that J. Krishnamurti has finally become senile. It is time
too, he is ninety years old. What he has said is absurd. Who was
appointed before me? Was Gautam Buddha an appointed master? Was Moses an
appointed master? Was Jesus appointed by somebody? There are things
which blossom on their own. It is not a government bureaucracy, where
you are appointed. And if a master is appointed by somebody else, he can
be dis-appointed any moment. Nobody can dis-appoint me.</p><p>It is not a criticism of me, it is a criticism of himself. He is the
only man in the whole history of humanity who was appointed by others as
a world teacher. And it is very strange – the people who appointed him
as a world teacher were themselves ignorant. They were waiting for the
world teacher to make them awake. These sleeping and snoring
Theosophists appointed J. Krishnamurti as the world teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that he refused. He refused the organization, he refused
the idea of being a world teacher. But his refusal seems only
superficial, he has remained a teacher all his life. What has he been
doing for almost a century? – teaching. But where is the appointment
order?</p><p><br></p><p>To know oneself is not something that anybody else can do for you.
And more particularly, how can sleeping people help the one who is
awake? They are dreaming; in their sleep they can only dream. Do you
expect these sleeping people to appoint the awakened one? That would be
hilarious.</p><p>Yes, nobody has appointed me. On that point he is not absolutely
wrong. But there is another point also, which is a little delicate. I
say nobody has appointed me, including myself. I am not a “self-
appointed master.” Whenever there is a master, he is recognized, not
appointed.</p><p><br></p><p>When the rose flowers, you don’t make it flower, but you can
recognize the fragrance. Even in your sleep you can feel that the night
is over and the sun has arisen. You are just hanging between sleep and
waking. You may take time to wake up, but somewhere deep down in you,
you know it is time to wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not appointed by anybody – to be appointed is an insult. And I
am not appointed by myself, because what is the need? – I know it.</p><p>The word “master” in the world of spirituality has a totally
different meaning. It is not the same as a schoolmaster. A master in the
spiritual sense is one who has mastery over himself, who does not
function unconsciously, whose every act – even the smallest gesture – is
conscious, alert. He may not have a single disciple – it doesn’t
matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see the point? The word “master” creates the idea of the
disciple, the follower. How can there be a master without a disciple, a
follower? But in the spiritual sense of the word “master” means mastery
of oneself. It has no relationship with any following; it does not
depend on the crowd. A master can be just alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I had started alone, and then slowly people started joining my
caravan. I was really surprised – I am still surprised. Surprised,
because how did these people recognize the fragrance, the flowering of
self- mastery? They are not awake, but one thing is certain: they are
not asleep either. Just the early morning hours You know, everybody
knows, that you are awake and still pretending to sleep. You</p><p>would have loved to sleep, but what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>I have never said that I am a master. It is something others have to
understand. I am not like Jesus who goes on proclaiming himself to be
the messenger of God, the only begotten son of God, and all that crap.
Of course, it is Christian crap. I am not like Mohammed, who says “I am
the messenger of God, and the last messenger. After me there is going to
be no change in the message.” Did God die fourteen hundred years ago,
when Mohammed declared, “I am the last prophet”?</p><p>I do not claim anything, and I am criticized for things which I have
never claimed. I am not a prophet, I am not a messiah, I am not a
messenger from any God – because there is no God. Yes, I am an alert,
conscious, ordinary man.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole beauty is that I have not proclaimed anything, and still
you have heard it. I have not said it, and you have understood it. I
have not knocked on your doors, I have not tried to convince you about
anything. I have never bothered about any respectability. I have just
lived in my own way, according to my own consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t claim that you are my followers. All followers are blind –
only the blind need to follow. Without any claim on my side, millions of
people around the world have come closer and closer to me. It is a
miracle.</p><p>I don’t count Jesus as a man of miracles. Whatever are called his
miracles are invented by the Christians. Secondly, even if he had done
those miracles, they are third-rate. Making bread out of stones.… If
this is true, there should not have been any Ethiopia. Half of the world
would not be dying. If he can change a stone into bread, then why not
change the whole Himalayas into a big bread? The secret is the same.</p><p>He turns water into wine. And I am always amazed – from Christian
pulpits this is declared to be a great miracle. This is a crime! What
about Jesus turning water into hashish, marijuana, LSD? He would be
behind bars! Do you think wine is not of the same category? In fact, it
is worse. LSD is far superior and less harmful.</p><p>Yes, if he had turned wine into water, I would call it a miracle, and
not illegal either. But I say to you, he has not done any of these
things, because if he had done these things – healing the people who are
sick, making the blind see, the lame walk, the dead come back to life
again – just average intelligence is needed to see it: if a man had done
all these things, do you think the Jews would have asked that he be
crucified?</p><p>If a man had done the miracle of raising the dead Lazarus back to
life, the whole of Judea would have fallen at his feet. That seems to be
absolutely natural. You can think yourself – if you see somebody raising
dead people to life, what are you going to do, crucify this man?</p><p>And how can you crucify a man who raises dead people to life? You may
have crucified him, but the man could have turned the crucifixion into
anything he wanted. The cross may have become a golden throne. If stones
can become bread, water can become wine, what is so impossible? The
cross becomes a golden throne That did not happen. Jesus could not save
himself.</p><p>I do not claim anything. I am just like you. But what can I do? If
you feel some fragrance arising out of my being, and you start moving
towards me from faraway lands – in spite of all the difficulties – then
I must say you are doing miracles. I am only a witness to what is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time for J. Krishnamurti to shut up completely. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE SAID THAT ALL YOUR WORDS OF THE PAST ARE NOT <span class=s10>IMPORTANT. SO</span> WHAT ARE ALL YOUR BOOKS FOR?</p><p>Jesus! I have never said that my books of the past are not important!
But you may have heard that. What I had said is that to me truth is not
something unchanging. Anything unchanging is dead.</p><p>Truth is alive, breathing, moving. So when I am saying something to
you now, don’t be bothered about the past – what I said twenty years
before. And I say to you, if I am still here tomorrow, the truth will
have become more potent, deeper, higher. My books of the past are not
unimportant.</p><p><br></p><p>I am just like a tree. When it comes to blossom, do you think now the
roots are unimportant, the trunk is no longer needed, the leaves are
unnecessary, because the tree has blossomed, the flowers have come? No,
you don’t say that. You know perfectly well that those flowers are
intrinsically connected with the hidden roots in the earth. It is all
one process. The flowers cannot exist without the leaves, without the
branches, without the trunk, without the roots. But when flowers are
there, don’t be bothered to compare them with the roots. Then you will
find great contradictions, inconsistencies.</p><p><br></p><p>There are. What is consistent between the roots and the flower? What
is consistent between the branches and the leaves and the flower? The
leaves may be green and the flower is red – so contradictory, so
inconsistent! The roots are ugly, the flower is so beautiful – what is
consistent? But when the flowers are there, you know perfectly well that
those roots underground are the base. The trunk, the branches are moving
– a movement towards the flowers, the leaves. They all help the
flower.</p><p>I have lived in many places, but I don’t own any house. I am a
houseless wanderer. I have always been a guest of somebody. But wherever
I have been, I have created beautiful gardens.</p><p><br></p><p>In one place the land was big. It was impossible for just me alone to
make the whole land green. I searched for a gardener, the best – because
less than that does not satisfy me. This gardener was receiving awards
every year, because every year there was a competition to see who brings
the biggest flowers, the most beautiful. From the whole province people
were participating, but this old man, a poor gardener, had been getting
the first prize for years. I asked him, “Would you love to be with me
and be my gardener?”</p><p><br></p><p>He had never lived in such a big bungalow – he was a poor man. He was
very happy, he had never had such a big piece of land. And I said, “All
the facilities will be provided, you don’t be worried. Whatever salary
you want, you just say. It is up to you to decide.”</p><p>A poor man, he said, “Thirty rupees per month would be enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “No. Thirty rupees for a man who creates so much beauty?
Sixty will be okay.” He could not</p><p>believe me, he thought I was mad – and perhaps he was right.</p><p><br></p><p>Sixty rupees in those days was a great salary; the headmaster of a
school or the head clerk of a big government office was getting it. And
I was alone in the big bungalow. I said, “You take as many rooms of this
bungalow as you want – free of charge. I am a guest, I don’t pay
anything; you are my guest, there is no problem. And every facility that
you need for the garden will be provided. Go and find out, purchase all
beautiful plants, flowers, trees, and make this barren land<span class=s6></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>It had remained barren for many years, because somehow the rumor
spread that the house was haunted. The owner could not sell it. Who is
going to purchase a haunted house? The owner was very nervous when he
offered it to me – he loved me. And I said, “That’s perfectly<span class=s6></span>that is a beautiful</p><p>building” – it was Victorian architecture – “I would love it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He thought perhaps I didn’t know that the house was haunted. He said,
“But one thing I have to say to you – I don’t want to keep you in the
dark – the house has been empty for years, and nobody purchases it,
nobody rents it, because the whole city know the house is haunted.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s great! In such a big house, to live alone does not
feel good. If a few ghosts are there, it</p><p>will be good company.”</p><p><br></p><p>The gardener brought all kinds of plants and flowers, and he started
working, because in the next competition he had to bring the greatest
rose flowers. But what did he do? On each rosebush he went on cutting
the buds. He would leave only one bud and cut all the other buds.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came to know of it, I said, “What are you doing?”</p><p>He said, “This is the only way to bring the biggest flowers, because
then all the juices of the tree start</p><p>moving into one flower to make it blossom. If there are many flowers,
then the juices are divided.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You forget about your annual exhibition. From now onwards I
will give you the award for not cutting a single bud! It is not
important that the rose should be big, it is enough that it is a rose.
And you are being murderous.”</p><p>I wanted to make it clear to you that the roses are there, but the
juice is flowing from the roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I have said in these thirty years – and I have been speaking
continuously, except for those few years when I was silent – every
single word is important, because they are all interconnected. You may
find contradictions, you may find inconsistencies. Don’t be afraid; life
is full of contradictions, full of inconsistencies. And I don’t know any
other god than life itself.</p><p>I have never said that my books of the past are not important. But
this goes on happening: I say one thing, you hear something else. I have
said only that what I am saying now is the highest flower on the that I
have been growing for thirty years. So if you have to decide, decide on
this moment’s statement, and don’t be bothered about inconsistencies,
contradictions.</p><p>And I have also said, remember this for tomorrow also. Tomorrow this
day will be old, gone. Newer flowers will be blossoming. Be always in
the present, and you will be always right. And don’t be afraid when
tomorrow you find an even better thing. Then don’t cling to the
yesterday. It was beautiful, but it was beautiful yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>It makes a very important implication clear. Why do people worship
dead saints, prophets, messiahs? They are very convenient; because they
are dead you can rest assured that they are not going to change their
statements. While they are alive you are always trembling – the man may
say something else tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>It is your incapacity to change, incapacity to remain a flow, that
makes you worship Jesus Christ when I am here! But Jesus Christ is
convenient – you can be certain about him. Not only that, you can read
whatsoever you want to read in his statements; he is not going to say to
you, “This is not what I said.”</p><p><br></p><p>All these theologians of different religions around the world, what
are they doing? They are making you more and more comfortable with the
religion you are addicted to. Yes, I use the word “addiction,” because
all religions are nothing but drugs. The theologians go on polishing,
making the statements more suitable to you. This you cannot expect
here.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say anything considering you, I say it because it is true! If
it hurts you, I am helpless. If it does not suit you, disturbs you, it
is your problem; I have nothing to do with it. My concern is to remain
flowing with existence, life, truth. And whatever existence wants to
speak through me, I will speak.</p><p>I never hesitate to contradict myself, because who am I to interfere?
It was a life force that said that, the same life force is saying this.
There must be some inner connection which you cannot see.</p><p><br></p><p>My books of the past are important, because they will be a test for
you – whether you can grow with me or you have stopped long ago.</p><p>It happened... a beautiful man, George Gurdjieff, had a great
disciple, P.D. Ouspensky. Nobody knew about Gurdjieff, but the whole
world know about Ouspensky, because Ouspensky was one of the best
mathematicians the world has ever known. Gurdjieff was a Caucasian...
who cares about the Caucasus? He was uneducated, but a tremendous man,
really terrific.</p><p><br></p><p>Ouspensky was in search of truth. He roamed around the world, he was
in India. He was searching for someone in whose eyes he could see that
the man knows. He was not looking for beautiful words, theorems – all
that he himself was capable of doing. And he searched all over India and
Tibet and could not find a man who was a living truth. He found great
scholars, he found famous religious leaders, but that was not his
search.</p><p>Ouspensky was really an authentic seeker. He was searching for a man
who was an embodiment of truth, who is not repeating words of some sages
who died thousands of years ago, a man who could say, “This is so.”
Whether religious scriptures agree with it or not does not matter. If
they agree, good for them; if they don’t agree, they are wrong. And
strangely enough, he found Gurdjieff in the same town, in the same cafe
where he used to go every day after his university classes. He found him
in Moscow. Life is very mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff was just sitting there. And the moment Ouspensky entered
and looked at the man – just like a flash, he knew, “This is the man I
have been searching here was that light, there was on that face
something unknown, mysterious. He fell in deep love with Gurdjieff. But
Gurdjieff was just as strange a man as I am. He was not an ordinary
scholar; he was not talking about what others have discovered, he was
saying only that which he had come to know.</p><p><br></p><p>Ouspensky lived with Gurdjieff for many years. Then the first world
war came, and Gurdjieff had to escape from Russia; Ouspensky also had to
escape. Ouspensky was welcome anywhere, any university would be proud of
having him.</p><p>He had written a book which has become almost the most important book
about not only mathematics, but about life and all its problems. He had
written a book called TERTIUM ORGANUM – the third canon of knowledge.
And in the beginning of the book he writes that the first organum was
written by Aristotle. Aristotle has a book named ORGANUM – knowledge,
wisdom. And the second book was written by Bacon, NOVUM ORGANUM – the
new wisdom. Both are very significant persons in the history of thought.
Aristotle is the father of all the logic that the West knows, and Bacon
is the father of all the sciences that have developed in the West.</p><p><br></p><p>Ouspensky said, “I am writing TERTIUM ORGANUM, the third canon of
wisdom, and I declare that</p><p>the third canon existed even before the first.” And it was not out of
any egoism – I have gone through</p><p><br></p><p>all the three canons – it was a simple statement of fact. Ouspensky
has transcended Aristotle and Bacon both. The book caused a great stir
in the whole world. London University invited him, because Russia was no
longer a safe place; the first world war and the communist revolution
were going on together.</p><p>Gurdjieff was hiding in a very faraway part of Russia, Tiflis. It was
almost another planet from London. And he asked Ouspensky to drop
everything and come back to Tiflis. Ouspensky loved the man so much, he
dropped his job, he dropped his work. He had opened a school in which he
was teaching Gurdjieff’s message. He closed the school and went into a
dangerous country where life was not safe. He arrived in Tiflis, and the
moment he entered Gurdjieff’s room, Gurdjieff said, “Good, you have
arrived. Now go back and resume your work.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was too much. Even Ouspensky, a man of such integrity, could not
stand it. But Gurdjieff’s methods, devices were such. This was a moment
of test, a test of trust. Ouspensky failed in that moment. He thought
Gurdjieff was simply insane: “I wasted everything that I had arranged,
traveled in a country where any moment I could have been killed – and he
does not even say, ‘Sit down, rest.’ He says, ‘Good that you have come.
Now just go back and resume your work.’”</p><p>He went back. Gurdjieff had impressed him immensely, so what did he
do? He dropped Gurdjieff, but he could not drop the Gurdjieff with whom
he had lived for years, or his teachings. A strange phenomenon happened.
For him Gurdjieff was divided into two parts. He continued to teach only
that part of Gurdjieff that was in tune with his logical mind. Beyond
that, Gurdjieff was his enemy.</p><p>Gurdjieff lived long, longer than Ouspensky. Ouspensky continued to
teach Gurdjieff’s teachings, but</p><p>those were the old teachings up to the point where Ouspensky dropped
out of the fold of Gurdjieff.</p><p>It is difficult to be with a living message, because the message goes
on moving in tune with existence. It does not bother about you. You have
to keep yourself running with the message, you have to forget all about
what was said in the past. The new, the latest, is always the right. And
it does not mean that what has preceded it was not important. Without it
this new phenomenon would not have been there at all.</p><p><br></p><p>In my thirty years’ life of talking from my heart to people,
thousands have come and gone. They still love me, but only up to the
point when they departed. After that they say, “Something has gone
wrong.”</p><p>Just the other day I heard about Amitabh – one of my sannyasins, very
much loved and respected by the commune. He just dropped sannyas a few
months ago and he is telling people, “Osho was right up to the moment I
left. Now he has fallen from his enlightenment.” Great idea! Nobody has
ever heard that anybody can fall from enlightenment. Amitabh has all the
credit for finding something new.</p><p>But it is absolutely idiotic – there is no way to fall from
enlightenment. Once you have known, there is no way to become ignorant
again. It is very difficult from ignorance to move towards wisdom. It is
very difficult – but only difficult, not impossible. To come back down
from wisdom to ignorance is impossible. It is just not the law of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>People, thousands of people, have walked along with me, but they go
only so far and stop. They were not coming along with me; they were
really finding nourishment for their own rubbish, knowledge. The moment
they found that I was saying something that went against their
knowledge, their religion, their party line, their ideology, they
stopped. They departed.</p><p>If you ask them, they will say, “Yes, there was a time when Osho was
right. He is no longer right.” But this is natural. Only a person who
has immense capacity to change, to go on and on, can find the truth of
life. And once you have found it there is no way to lose it, because you
find it in the very innermost being of yourself. You are it! How can you
drop it somewhere? How can you forget about it?</p><p><br></p><p>But the disciple who stops at a certain point certainly has to
console himself, that “Up to this point Osho was right. After that, he
has gone wrong.” He does not know that right is not a static thing, it
is a growing phenomenon.</p><p>You are very comfortable with Jesus – and he was born a Jew, he lived
as a Jew, he died as a Jew. He never heard the word “Christian.” He was
unaware even of the word “Christ,” because the word “Christ” is Greek.
He knew only one language, Aramaic; he was not even acquainted with
Hebrew. Aramaic was a local language of ordinary people; Hebrew was the
language of the priests, of the high-class people. Aramaic is just a
common form of Hebrew. In Hebrew and Aramaic there is no word like
“Christ,” the word is “messiah.”</p><p><br></p><p>His own people, the Jews, could not accept Jesus as a messiah,
because he was saying things that were disturbing them. His common way
of talking was, “It has been told to you in the past, an eye for an eye.
But I say unto you, if somebody slaps you on one cheek, give him the
other cheek also.” He was contradicting the old prophets. This was not
acceptable to his people.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus alive was crucified. Dead, he has the biggest following in the
world. This is a miracle. When he was living, nobody wanted to be
associated with him. Dead, even those who are not Christians, like
Mahatma Gandhi, Hazrat Mohammed – one is a Hindu, another is a
Mohammedan – are ready to accept him as a prophet. It is easier now. He
has stopped; you can manage to go up to the stoppage.</p><p><br></p><p>With me you will find it difficult – until I die. And don’t hope that
I am going to die soon. I am going to disturb you as much as possible.
If you can manage to live with a living message, and if you have the
guts to go on changing with the living message, you are blessed. Many
will come around me, but only a few will remain. Yes, after my death
many more will come, and everybody will remain!</p><p><br></p><p>Your mind is somehow very stubborn about changing, because change
brings difficulties. Change brings new things, and you have to begin
again and again and again. But be courageous. If you are not courageous
you are already dead. Just to go on breathing is not enough to be alive.
I define life as a constant change, and the capacity to go with it
wherever it leads you. If you have that courage, truth is not far away.
Only the courage is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me, that I have said that my old books are not
important You want to divide me in two</p><p>parts – my old books, and my present message to you – so that you can
choose. I will not allow you such a convenient way.</p><p><br></p><p>My old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you
will not be able to understand me. But remember, it is a constant flow
and change, so don’t be bothered with inconsistencies,
contradictions.</p><p>If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the
truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then
you can see, crystal-clear, that it is a single message from the roots
to the flower. It is a single organism.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A FEW MONTHS BACK YOU SAID, “IF THIS IS BAD LAND USE, THEN YOUR LAND
USE LAWS ARE BOGUS, AND THEY SHOULD BE BURNED.”</p><p>WALDEN KIRSCH, KGW TELEVISION CHANNEL 8 NEWS, HAS SAID, “THE OREGON
SUPREME COURT RULED THIS MORNING THAT RAJNEESHPURAM IS INDEED A LEGAL
CITY. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE CITY FOR
THEIR COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE, AND TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION,
RAJNEESHISM.” WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?</p><p>I do not care what the Supreme Court decides. This is the only legal
city in the whole world. There is no crime here, no rape, no theft, no
murder. Even in the middle of the night any woman can go anywhere in the
darkness without any fear. It is not a question – whether this city is
legal or not.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known many cities. People are living there side by side, but
they are not together. Those cities are just like a crowd, not a living
organism.</p><p>This city is a totally new phenomenon. It is a living organism.
People are not just a crowd here; they have chosen to be part, a living
part of the whole. There are no families in this city, this whole city
is a family! You cannot find this phenomenon anywhere else. Families are
small units keeping themselves separate from other families, fighting
with their neighbors – you know.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus had two things to say: “Love your enemy as you love yourself.”
That is not great, many have said it, but the second thing is really
great. He said, “Love your neighbor just as you love yourself.” And that
is very difficult to do. Have you ever heard of neighbors loving each
other? Not only ordinary neighbors, but great leaders, religious masters
– they too cannot stand the neighbor.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard A rabbi and a Christian bishop lived in one
neighborhood. Their houses were</p><p>opposite each other, and they were continuously hating, being
jealous, competing about everything.</p><p>The bishop purchased a Buick car; that almost caused a heart attack
in the rabbi. In the morning the bishop was pouring water on the Buick.
The rabbi could not contain himself. He asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “I am doing a baptism. The car is being transformed
into a Christian car. This was more trouble. The rabbi could not sleep.
Somehow he managed, and the next day purchased a Cadillac. Now it was
the turn of the bishop to get a heart attack.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the morning the rabbi started to cut the exhaust pipe with big
garden scissors. The bishop</p><p>could not believe what was going on. He said, “What is the matter?
What are you doing?” The rabbi said, “I am doing a circumcision – now
the car is really Jewish.”</p><p>This is the only place where you will find people from all over the
world – different races, different colors, different languages –
becoming one family. We don’t have any neighbor, so we don’t need Jesus’
advice to love your neighbor – we don’t have any.</p><p>But it is good that the Supreme Court proved itself, proved that
there is still hope of democracy in America, that there is a possibility
of some fairness. The Supreme Court’s decision is very decisive and very
historic in the sense that against all the bigots, against all the
politicians, against all the pressures, they still remained true to the
law. The decision must rejoice you, for the simple reason that it shows
we are not in the Soviet Union.</p><p><br></p><p>America should think over this decision, and try to remain democratic
whatsoever the consequences, because this is the only country that holds
any hope for humanity.</p><p>Rajneeshpuram was legal – it would have remained legal even without
the decision of the Supreme Court. We were going to fight to the very
end, because it is not only a question of a small commune; it is a
question of the very spirituality of this nation.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians are nothing but pollution. As a democracy becomes purer
and purer, more and more does the pressure of the politicians become
insignificant. Democracy comes to its uttermost flowering when
politicians disappear completely.</p><p>Our fight will continue, because those cunning politicians who were
trying to destroy this city – just because we want to live in our own
way, and we want to think in our own way, and we want not to be led by
those idiots – they will go on trying other ways to harass you. But
nobody can harass my people, because to harass somebody two parties are
needed: one who harasses and one who becomes harassed. We are not going
to become harassed. We have nothing to lose, nothing to fear – who fears
dead people? Their cities are nothing but cemeteries, legal
cemeteries!</p><p><br></p><p>I must thank the Supreme Court on behalf of all of you, that it has
saved so many innocent people from getting utterly disappointed.</p><p>Now we can grow – because in my vision, I have always seen the
commune consisting of at least 100,000 sannyasins. And it is going to
happen! No evil politicians can stop it happening. We are going to make
this place, which was just a desert, green, full of rejoicings, songs
and dances. I want Rajneeshpuram to become the Garden of Eden.</p><p><br></p><p>You will see God one day – if there is any God – knocking on your
doors: “Please let me come in!”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS BEYOND REBELLION, BEYOND ALONENESS, BEYOND MEDITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>You!</p><p><br></p><p>Next question. Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS A GOOD SANNYASIN?</p><p><br></p><p>I have never come across one, because it is a contradiction. A good
sannyasin – what do you mean? Can there be a bad sannyasin too? To be a
sannyasin is to be goodness itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay. Question 6 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IF ENLIGHTENMENT MEANS TO BE BEYOND ALL DUALITIES, NOT CHOOSING, THEN
WHY ARE YOU AGAINST WARS, POLITICS AND OTHER STUPIDITIES OF MANKIND?</p><p>Yes, enlightenment means choicelessness – but you are not enlightened
yet. For me there is no choice. If the third world war comes, I will be
just the same as I am. If the whole world is destroyed, it won’t change
anything in me – neither my bliss, nor my peace, nor my love.</p><p><br></p><p>But for you.… Because you are not enlightened, I have been talking
against wars, against superstitions, against stupidities. I am not
speaking to myself – do you think I am crazy? – I am talking to you. And
for you there is at every step a choice. Till you come to the moment of
enlightenment and choicelessness, you will have to choose; before that
there is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as a blind man carries a stick in his hand, groping for
his way. But if his eyes are cured, will he still grope with the stick?
He will throw the stick away.</p><p>Whatever I am saying to you is just giving you a stick till you are
ready to open your eyes. Then, throw the stick. Then there is nothing
good, nothing bad. Then whatever the enlightened person does is right.
And there is no question of choice, because he can see. He does not
choose. Choice implies thinking. He does not think, he simply sees his
way and moves on it.</p><p>My work is arduous. I have to speak from a point to you, who are
almost on another planet; the distance is vast. Remove the distance. Of
course I am not going to move close to you. The thirsty goes to the
well, not vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p>I am here, available. If you are thirsty, move closer to me. And soon
you will know that light, that insight, that explosion of bliss in which
there is no choice.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is choicelessness. But don’t misunderstand me. Before
that, you will have to move very cautiously, choosing the right against
the wrong, choosing the truer so that you can reach to the ultimate
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>12</span></p><p><br></p><p>Doubt: the methodology of the seeker</p><p><br></p><p>10 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD SWAMI PREMANAM SAYABOUTTHE DISCOURSESTHATTHEYARE BORING,
HE DOES NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM; THAT DISCOURSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME,
AND HE PREFERS WORKERS’ DARSHAN.</p><p>COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>Anam is a confirmed creep. But what he is saying has much truth in it
– not because the discourses are boring, but because he is not here.
Physically he is here, but his mind is roaming all over the place.
Perhaps he may be hearing, but he is not listening to me.</p><p>These discourses are my heart. I am opening myself to you, revealing
to you finally and exactly what I am. But there are people like Anam who
are not interested in this revelation. Then the thing appears boring.
But I am puzzled – if it is boring you, who is forcing you to be here?
Are you sitting here to torture yourself? I am not at all interested
whether you are here or not. If the discourses are boring, then you must
be enjoying your boredom. And boredom is not in the discourses, because
you are the only one who is bored.</p><p>Look at these people! Raise your hands, those who are not bored –
both hands!</p><p><br></p><p>Anam, have you seen these hands? You are a bored person, utterly
bored. You don’t have the</p><p>patience even to understand what I am saying. Are you British by
chance?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that whenever a joke is told, the French understand it
immediately. Their laughter is an immediate response. The British laugh
twice: first, when they hear the joke – not that they have understood
the joke, but just to be polite, not to offend you in any way. And the
second time, in the middle of the night they laugh again: they have got
it.</p><p>The Germans never laugh. And the Jews... if you tell a joke to a Jew,
he will not laugh, he will say to you, “This joke is very old, and
moreover you are telling it all wrong!” It is the same joke, but
different people are reacting differently.</p><p>What I am saying is the same for all of you, but everybody is
interpreting it in his own way. Most of you are rejoiced, your hearts
are open to me. Your ears are not only hearing; behind your ears you are
silently listening to me. How can you be bored? But Anam is bored. The
whole credit goes to himself, I am not responsible for it. And why does
he go on dragging himself here everyday – to be bored? Perhaps he is
some kind of masochist, he wants to be bored.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is significant, because I am the first person in the
whole history of human consciousness whose people are allowed to have a
hearty laugh in the temple. Otherwise in temples, churches, mandirs, you
go with a long face, looking very serious. This mandir does not belong
to those traditional temples and churches and synagogues. This is a
place of rejoicing, and if you are unable to rejoice, don’t come. Do
something else, don’t waste your time.</p><p>You are saying your time is wasted, Anam. Your whole life is wasted.
What have you done? Your whole life – just have a look backwards – has
been a wastage. What flowers have blossomed in you? It is really your
whole life, dry, dull, boring, which has made you incapable of enjoying.
And if you are not coming here, how are you going to use your time so
that it is not wasted? What are you going to do?</p><p><br></p><p>Here there is a chance that perhaps you may awake one day and start
growing. Then the time will not be wasted. Of course, in your sleep you
may have thought it was wasted, but when you wake up you will be
grateful.</p><p>But don’t come here. And remember always, I am a very unreliable man,
as unreliable as nature, particularly here in Rajneeshpuram – the
weather changes so quickly. If you feel bored, it is not unimaginable
for me to just leave this podium forever. But remember, all these people
will suffer because of you.</p><p><br></p><p>I said just the other day that I am not going to be silent, but that
was the other day. If anybody is bored, I am not interested in boring
anybody, I can just now stop speaking forever. But it looks very
undemocratic to me, that just because of one idiot, my whole people
around the world will miss my word.</p><p>So you have to decide, Anam. If you come here, get in tune with me,
with what I am saying; otherwise, there is no need to come here. Our
commune is a family of totally free individuals. You have decided on
your own to be part of it. You can leave not only the Mandir you can
leave the commune, and we will rejoice.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are saying you enjoyed in the past years the silent satsang
with the sannyasins. I am</p><p>amazed at people’s stupidity. You cannot remain silent for two
minutes! We had satsang on the</p><p><br></p><p>sixth, and I got so fed up with your insensitivity that I have
dropped it forever. In the future there will be no silent satsang in the
morning... because we were playing music and then there would be a gap –
just a little gap of two minutes. We would do the humming and then there
would be a gap of two minutes.</p><p>Devaraj was quoting some words from my past expressions to remind you
of what I am saying. I have been sowing the seeds for a long time. You
cannot see in the seed the flower. He was quoting the seeds to make it
clear to you that those same seeds have come to a flowering, and they
are going to flower more and more. After his quotation there was again
two minutes’ silence.</p><p><br></p><p>And what were you doing, Anam, in those silent periods? I saw people
coughing all over the place. That coughing is absolutely psychological.
Why are you not coughing now? I will speak for two hours and you will
not cough a single time. And in those two minutes of silence, not one
person, but everybody was coughing. Coughing has something to do with
your psychology. One man coughs, and it is infectious, suddenly you
realize that your throat is also ready.</p><p>While the music was there, you were engaged with the music. While you
were humming, you were engaged in humming. The most difficult parts were
those few moments of silence. Either you were coughing all over the
place – suddenly the Mandir became Koran Grove – or you were laughing,
which was disrespectful to the Mandir, to the commune. After music,
after humming, an intelligent person will fall into a deeper silence;
that is the purpose of that music. But no, you start laughing. The
reason is, you cannot stand to be in silence for two minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, Anam, you are asking for silent satsang. And I know you more
than you know yourself. You may think yourself a wise guy, but you are
simply crazy. You think you are a therapist – you need therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>And there may be a few other creeps who have crept into the commune.
It is good if they get lost forever. A single rotten fish will spread
its rottenness to other fish in the pond. And people in this commune are
so close to each other, so intimate with each other, that anything
contagious affects not only one person, it affects the whole commune.
That’s why I don’t call it an organization. It is not, it is an
organism, just as your body is an organism, not an organization.</p><p>If your body were an organization, scientists would have been
immensely happy, because then if you had a fracture in your leg, the
whole leg could be unscrewed – you would just have to go to the workshop
and they could screw on a new leg. If your head was going cuckoo, you
could go the workshop and they could change it. But man is not a
mechanism put together, man is an organism. Everything in man is
connected with everything else; the whole body is functioning in
tremendous harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>This commune is an organism.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want any bored person here. You will be immensely benefited –
become a Catholic priest, then your boredom will pay you. Here, you will
just look out of place.</p><p>And I am not saying this only to Anam I had given you the name Anam –
anam means anonymous,</p><p>nameless – because when I gave you sannyas I could see in your eyes
that you were not an</p><p><br></p><p>organism functioning in beautiful silent harmony: you are a cuckoo.
But I give sannyas to anybody – even to cuckoos, hoping against hope
that perhaps just through your being near me a miracle may happen.</p><p>And when I am talking to you, do you understand the process of
talking in deep love and intimacy? Perhaps you are not aware. You love a
person – you want to touch the person, hug the person, kiss the person.
Why do you do all these things? To get as close to the person as
possible. I cannot hug millions of people. Before they have stopped
hugging me, I will be dead. Kissing to me is unhygienic.</p><p><br></p><p>I can touch you only with my words. It is a touching experience, far
superior to the ways you know of touching each other. A word is a
bridge. If you allow yourself to become part of the communion, you
cannot be bored; you will be in immense rejoicing, you will be
blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody can force you to be blissful. Why get miserable sitting
here? Do something that makes you happy. And I don’t know what makes you
happy. If my words cannot make you happy, then take it for granted that
at least in this life you are not going to be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a great art to be blissful. One has to learn it.</p><p><br></p><p>Become more and more organic.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I am speaking, I am speaking; you are silent. The moment I
stop speaking, you start yakketty-yak, yakketty-yak; your mind starts
going round and round. You are not listening to me, Anam, that’s why you
feel bored. You are bored with yourself. In not listening to me, you are
simply listening to your own mind, and you know your mind perfectly
well. If you are listening to me, then your mind stops. Then who can be
bored? And how?</p><p>I have heard about a man who was sitting in a chair in a waiting room
on the railway station. Many other people were also waiting in the
waiting room. They all became interested in this man, because what he
was doing appeared very strange. Sometimes he would smile for no reason
at all. Sometimes he would burst into laughter. Sometimes he would throw
away something which was not there, but his hands, his face, expressed
the idea that he wanted to get rid of something. He was saying, “No, no”
– not in words, in gestures.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole waiting room fell into silence. What was this man doing?
And he looked rich, well- dressed, educated. Finally one man got up to
ask him, “What are you doing? – because we are getting more and more
curious. Now it is too much; and the train is late – we will have to
watch you for at least two hours more. It is becoming mysterious.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “There is nothing mysterious. I was just telling jokes
to myself. And whenever I came across an old joke, I threw it away – I
have heard it so many times. When something really juicy comes into my
mind, there is a smile. Sometimes just a smile is not enough, the joke
is so wonderful that I burst out into laughter. But all this I am doing
to myself. How are you concerned? You do your work.”</p><p>Anam, if you are bored, you are doing it to yourself. Please stop
doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying to you is of the utmost importance, because it is a
way of touching, but more subtle and sophisticated. A word comes out of
my heart, travels to you, and if you are available, reaches exactly into
your heart. Neither holding hands can do it, nor even kissing can do it
– even French kissing! Not even making love can do it. Making love is a
also a way of getting close, so close that you are in each other. But
what a communion can do, even lovemaking cannot do.</p><p>Genitals meeting is not a great meeting. It is the lowest form of
meeting – even buffalos are doing it. Only man is capable, at the
highest sophisticated level, of touching your very heart.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you cannot understand my words, forget forever the idea that
you will be able to understand my silence. Even while I am speaking, it
is there. I am not an orator, I am not a speaker. That’s why, speaking a
word, just in the middle of the sentence I will stop, will give a gap;
in that gap I am trying to reach you through silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t just listen to my words, listen also to the gaps. And any
orator will think that I am strange; this is not the way to speak. But I
am not interested in speaking, I am trying to contact you in thousands
of ways.</p><p><br></p><p>My talk is full of silence. If you sort it out, in two hours you will
certainly find for half an hour I have been silent. And it is a far
deeper silence, because the word makes you listen to me, and then comes
the silent period. In that silent period you are waiting for me to
complete the sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>And this cannot be done – I never do a thing – it is a happening. I
cannot speak in another way, because my purpose will be fulfilled only
by words followed by wordlessness.</p><p>Anam, I love you as I love everybody. Just think of it – I go on
throwing flowers on you, and you go on throwing mud on me? My own people
saying to me that my talk is boring?</p><p>My talk is so full of silence. Listen to both, and it is easier.
After a big storm there is a deep silence following it. This is the law
of nature: day follows night, life is followed by death, word follows
wordlessness. On both sides.… Then it is not a discourse, not oratory;
it is a way of reaching you, touching you at the very innermost center
of your being.</p><p>But if you are still bored, then just get up and get out, and get
lost. Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAY A SKEPTIC CANNOT BE A DISCIPLE, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT
YOU NEVER WANT US TO STOP DOUBTING. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SKEPTICISM AND DOUBT.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great difference between doubt and skepticism. Not only is
there a difference, they are diametrically opposite to each other.</p><p>Skepticism is already a religion, a belief, a conclusion; it is a
negative type of conclusion. The skeptic</p><p>has no philosophy of his own to contribute; all he does is argue
against anybody else’s ideology. But</p><p><br></p><p>don’t ask about his ideology, he has none. He has become a big no, he
has become negativity. He</p><p>does not believe in anything – but this is also a belief.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, he does not believe in God. We call him an unbeliever,
but it is not right to say that he does not believe in God; he believes
that there is no God. It is a belief. Because it is negative you are
confused. The theist believes in God; the skeptic does not believe in
God, but he is not a seeker, he is not creative, he is not positive. He
is not searching for the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>In ancient Greece there was a school, before Socrates, called the
Sophists. They were skeptical people. They had nothing to offer, and
they had everything, every argument, every weapon to destroy.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to say no. To say yes is very difficult.</p><p>You can say no to anything. If somebody says, “Look at the beautiful
sunset,” you can say, “I can see the sun is setting, but I don’t see
that there is anything beautiful. Prove to me what beauty is. How can
you dare to call this sunset beautiful? Unless you define beauty, you
cannot call anything beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>And beauty has escaped definition. For thousands of years people have
tried to define beauty, to define truth, to define love, but no effort
has succeeded, for the simple reason that these things are experiences;
you cannot explain them. But if you want to explain them away there is
no difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>The skeptic has already settled in his “no” attitude towards
everything. The man is not different from</p><p>any other believer; they have all settled. None of them is on the way
to seek.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you can understand the difference and the diametrical opposition
between doubt and skepticism. Doubt is not a conclusion, doubt is the
beginning of a journey, a pilgrimage. The skeptic has arrived and found
as an answer, no – to everything, everything that cannot be placed in
front of him, on the table, so he can dissect it.</p><p>Karl Marx has said,“Unless I can see God in a test-tube, in a
scientific lab, being dissected, I am not going to believe in him.”</p><p><br></p><p>God is not to be discovered in a test-tube, God has to be searched
for. Of course when you begin to search you will have to doubt thousands
of things until you arrive at a point where your doubt disappears.
Suddenly you are face to face with reality. You will be amazed: you will
not find a God, and at the same time you cannot deny that you have found
something, something which is even higher than God. I call it
godliness.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is the methodology of the seeker. Doubt sharpens your
intelligence. It is a challenge. You are neither saying yes, nor are you
saying no. You are saying only one thing, “I am ignorant, and I am not
going to trust unless I have experienced, whatsoever the case, unless I
arrive at something which is indubitable – howsoever I make the effort
to doubt it, my doubt goes on failing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reality is so vast, overwhelming, so tangible, so real, that even
this so-called real world, compared to that reality, looks like a
dream.</p><p>Doubt is something of tremendous significance. Only those who have
doubted to the very end have found what truth is, what love is, what
silence is, what beauty is. Skepticism finds nothing. It is utterly
empty, but it makes much noise. Empty drums make much noise. And you
cannot argue with a skeptic because he will go on saying no to anything,
to any value which you cannot place as an object before him.</p><p>But doubt – of course, it is a long way and a hard way – goes on
eliminating all that is not true. Ultimately only that which is true
remains. And nobody can deny truth when one is facing it, experiencing
it. Out of that experience comes yes: “Yes, Osho, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a belief. You have searched, gone into great anxiety,
anguish, despair. There were many moments when you wanted to stop,
because it looked as if the journey was endless. It is not. There is an
end; you just have to keep yourself going.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is surgical – it goes on cutting all that is absurd. But
finally the real remains, unclouded. Doubt removes the clouds.</p><p>The skeptic says no to the sun because it is clouded; he cannot see
the sun. He comes immediately to the conclusion that there is no sun, no
light. The doubter removes all the clouds, cuts his way through the
clouds. Not that he believes that there is something behind them – there
may be nothing – but he has to know whatever is behind the clouds. And
everybody who has gone far has ended with truth. It needs guts.</p><p>The skeptic is a poor man, just like the theists, just like all the
so-called religious people in the world. Skepticism is a negative side,
it is a negative religion. There is no difference between a skeptic and
a believer; they both agree that there is no need for search. One
believes there is a sun behind the clouds, another believes there is
nothing behind the clouds. But nobody is ready to take the long journey,
to pass through all kinds of nightmares, and to reach behind the clouds.
Few have reached.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you doubt, I don’t teach you skepticism. And remember, doubt
is not skepticism; it is search, it is seeking.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Socrates, this school of skeptical people was called Sophism.
They were traveling teachers, wandering teachers. They used to take a
big fee, much money, to make you a sophist. A sophist is one who can
take any side, he does not care for truth. If you pay him good money, he
will be on your side. Or, if the opposite side pays him big money, he
will be on the opposite side. As far as he is concerned he knows
nothing, but he knows the art of argumentation.</p><p>I have heard In a small church in a small town, the priest was very
much disturbed by an old man.</p><p>But the old man was the richest man in his congregation. He had
donated much – in fact he had built the church. He was paying the salary
of the priest, of course. He used to sit just in the front row in front
of the priest, but he was old and always went to sleep. The sleep was
not disturbing to the priest, but he snored – and really loud. The
priest was disturbed because the old man was disturbing the whole
congregation, and the congregation was disturbed because he was
disturbing everybody’s sleep!</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the congregation said to the priest, “Something has to be
done. This old man disturbs you – just in front somebody snoring, and
loudly. And this old man disturbs our sleep also.”</p><p>People in Christian countries remain awake late on Saturday night
because tomorrow is Sunday, they can rest. And early in the morning they
have to go to church. Perhaps they have not slept the whole night – and
church is the best place to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>So they said, “We come early in the morning just to have a good nap,
and this idiot wakes everybody. Rather than listening to your sermon, we
listen to his snoring – so please do something!”</p><p>The priest thought. The old man used to come with one of his
grandsons, a small boy; he used to sit</p><p>by his side. The priest thought, “Perhaps the boy can be bribed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He talked to the boy and he said, “I will give you one dollar every
Sunday if you go on waking the old man. Just with your hand go on
hitting him so he remains awake. The moment he snores you start hitting.
I will give you one dollar.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “Good. There is no problem, I will not let him sleep
anymore.”</p><p>And the next Sunday was beautiful. Everybody slept. The priest
repeated the same sermon that he had been... he had three or four
sermons ready. And the boy went on hitting the old man with his
hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “What nonsense! What are you doing
continually?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy laughed, but he did not allow the old man to sleep or
snore.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, the old man asked, “What is the matter? You disturbed my
whole morning. You have to tell</p><p>me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “It is a question of business. The priest has given me
one dollar to keep you awake, because you snore.”</p><p>The old man said, “Don’t be worried; if it is business, I will give
you two dollars. Just don’t disturb me the coming Sunday.”</p><p>The next Sunday came, and the priest was puzzled. He looked at the
boy many times, blinked at the boy that the old man had started snoring,
but the boy sat silently smiling. Nobody could sleep. Somehow the priest
finished the sermon, took the boy aside and asked, “What happened? Don’t
you want the dollar?”</p><p>He said, “What can I do? It is a question of business.” The priest
asked, “What business?”</p><p>He said, “The old man has promised to give me two dollars. Now it is
up to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Of course the poor priest knew that he could not win in competition
with that old man. If he gave three dollars – which was too much for a
poor priest – the old man would give four. He was bound to lose
completely by this strategy. The boy was not interested – he was not
interested in the priest, he was not interested in the congregation, he
was not interested in the old man. It was a sheer question of
business.</p><p>That was the attitude of the sophists. Even kings used to send their
sons, who were going to become kings of their country someday, to the
sophists to learn the art, so that whatever the case is, you can always
manage to win it. There is no question of right and wrong for a sophist;
the question is whose argument is stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>But it happened... a young man came to a very famous sophist teacher.
The young man was very rich, and the sophist teacher asked for an
enormous amount of money. The young man said, “Don’t be worried,
whatever you ask I will give, but on one condition. Half of the money I
will pay now and half of the money I will pay to you when I have been
victorious in some argument with somebody. That will be the test of
whether you have been really teaching me or just exploiting.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable, and the old sophist teacher knew that there
was no problem. “You are going to</p><p>win against anybody. I am the greatest sophist in the whole of
Greece, don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>Half the money was paid. After two years the young man was perfectly
trained in the art of argumentation; from any side he was able to win.
If he chose to support theism he was able to win, if he wanted to
support atheism he was able to win. He now had the knack of how to
present a case and how to argue about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher said, “Now your education is finished. Bring the other
half of my money that you had</p><p>promised.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “But I have not yet been a winner. You will have to
wait, that was the condition.” And the young man proved far smarter than
the great sophist. He never argued with anybody. Whatever you said, he
would say yes. But he would never enter into any argument, so the
question of winning never arose. One year pased, two years passed – but
the old sophist was not going to be cheated in this way. This young man
was trying to be really too much.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man filed a case in the court against the young man, that he
had promised to give him half of the money when his education was over
and he had not given it. The idea of the great teacher was really
marvelous. He thought, “If the court decides,”You will receive half the
money only when he wins a case,” I am defeated, the young man has won
his first victory.” So he planned that outside the court he would say,
“Now you have won your first victory, give me half the money.” But he
never got that money, he got defeated in the court.</p><p>He had thought of the other possibility: if he won the case –
although there was no possibility, but he was a great arguer – if he won
the case, then too, he would tell the young man, “You are going against
the court’s decision, you have to pay the money.” But he had not thought
about it – that the young man was his own student, and knew all his
tactics.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man argued perfectly, and in fact the case was clearly
stronger on his side: “Until I win my</p><p>first argument, I will not pay the other half.” The teacher was not
interested in winning the case.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is certainly true that this was the condition.” He
accepted it before the court, hoping that out of the court he would say,
“Now<span class=s6></span>”</p><p>He lost the case, the young man won the case, and after the court on
the steps he took hold of the</p><p>young man and said, “Boy, now you have won your argument, give me my
money.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “I am your student – you cannot deceive me. I
cannot go against the court’s decision; that would be contempt of court.
And if you insist, come back inside the court and ask before the
magistrate.”</p><p><br></p><p>This sophistry has continued down the ages; it has taken many names –
now it is called skepticism. The skeptic has no ideology, so you cannot
defeat him. He never proposes anything. If he never proposes anything,
how can you defeat him? He has no belief system. He is in a far stronger
position. You have a belief system; he can find loopholes in it and
defeat you.</p><p>The skeptic is bound to win against anybody who has a system of
beliefs. The skeptic gains nothing but only these futile argumentations
and victories. And the more he becomes articulate in arguments, the more
he is unaware that life is not to argue, life is not to say no, because
no means death. And just wasting your life destroying other people’s
arguments, what are you going to gain? You wasted your whole life.</p><p>I am not teaching you skepticism, I am teaching you the art of doubt.
Doubt does not say that it is not so. The doubt simply says, “I am
ignorant. I have not experienced it yet; hence, I will continue to doubt
till I achieve the authentic, the real. Then I will be all yes – but not
before that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man of doubt, only the man of doubt, some day becomes the man of
truth. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IF YES AND NO ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE SMALLEST BLADE OF GRASS IS
NEEDED AS MUCH AS THE MOST DISTANT STAR, WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THE
NEGATIVE RESISTANCE OF THE OREGONIANS TO YOUR VISION? HOW ARE WE TO
UNDERSTAND IT?</p><p><br></p><p>I welcome it. The antagonism of the Oregonians is our strength. Their
antagonism is a blessing to us. They may be thinking otherwise, but they
don’t know how the law of life functions. The more they try to destroy
us, the more indestructible this commune will be, because when you had
to face opposition, for the first time you bring your intelligence to
its highest peak. When you see that so much negativity is around you –
you are just a small island and all around is the ocean of Oregonians –
it gives you an opportunity to rise to the moment, to face it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a well-known fact that even the greatest scientists use only
fifteen percent of their intelligence. The average person uses only
seven percent of his potential. What is the difference between the
ordinary, average person and the scientists? Why does the scientist rise
to fifteen percent? Because he has taken upon himself a challenge to
find the truth about something.</p><p><br></p><p>He will be opposed by those dogmatic people who have already come to
a conclusion. They will say, “There is no need for you to work on it. We
know the answer, it is in THE BIBLE; just read THE BIBLE. One book is
enough. It is the holy book; God has given everything that is needed to
be known.”</p><p>But people like Copernicus, Galileo, Columbus, go against THE BIBLE.
THE BIBLE says the earth is flat. It looks flat. Science has to rise
above the average man’s idea that whatever you see is right. In all the
languages there are proverbs which say, “Don’t believe in hearing,
believe in seeing.”</p><p>If you look around you, the earth is flat, because our vision through
the eyes in not vast enough, and we are standing on the earth. There is
no horizon; it is your limited capacity of vision. When you start losing
your eyesight, the horizon comes closer to you; when you become blind,
there is no horizon. When you are young, you see the beauty of the
horizon. The horizon depends on your eyes, it has nothing to do with the
earth. The earth is vast, and man is so tiny and his eyes cannot see so
far.</p><p><br></p><p>But the scientist tries to find whether there is some place where the
earth and the sky meet. He doubts your knowledge of the past, he doubts
your scriptures. He wants to know it for himself; only then can he be
sure. He goes on and on and on, and finds that the horizon is an
illusion. There is no place where earth and heaven meet.</p><p><br></p><p>These scientists first started logically, rationally, to find out
what kind of earth is possible, and they decided that it is a globe, not
a flat piece of land. It was hypothetical. Columbus experimented on this
hypothesis. He was thought to be a madman. But never be afraid – even a
madman will find somebody more mad to help.</p><p><br></p><p>In thirty years, this has been my experience. I am a madman, but I
have never been without friends. They are certainly madder than me.</p><p><br></p><p>The queen of Spain supported Columbus. She said, “What is the harm? I
have enough money, he has enough argument. Let him have a chance, let
him go for for a journey around the earth. If the earth is a globe, then
finally he will come back to the same place from where he started.” It
is simple logic: if you move in a circle, you will come back to the same
place. “And if the earth is flat, we are not responsible; he is
insisting. If the earth is flat, then his ship will finally fall down at
the edge of the earth. That is his responsibility, if he goes to hell.
For me, it will be just a little loss of money – that does not
matter.”</p><p>Then it was a question of finding at least ninety people – three
ships were to go, because nobody was clear how long it would take to
come back. So much food, clothes for every season, enough people to take
these three big ships.</p><p>The queen said, “Don’t be worried, money can purchase anything,” and
she purchased ninety people. They were all Christians; they thought that
the earth was flat, but she was giving so much money that they thought,
even if the ship fell into utter darkness, they would be leaving enough
money for their family, at least for three generations – which they
could not manage to earn being here. They could not even manage enough
food, enough clothes, shelter. So ninety people were ready and they
sailed off.</p><p><br></p><p>The horizon was there, but again and again it changed its place. Two
months and twenty-seven days had passed, and there was the horizon still
at the same distance. This proved perfectly that the horizon is an
illusion. It is the limitation of our eyesight and our position standing
on the earth. You can see the sun is round, you can see the moon is
round because you are so far away that you can see the whole thing. But
standing on the earth itself you cannot see the whole earth.</p><p>Columbus was immensely happy. But they had taken enough food for only
three months. Those ninety people – they were not scientists, they had
not come to prove anything; they were just there for money. With their
Bibles they still believed that the earth was flat and that Columbus was
mad. But they had got so much money, who cared whether he was mad or
not?</p><p><br></p><p>But after two months and twenty-seven days, they became nervous. They
were almost having nervous breakdowns: “What is going to happen now?
Even if Columbus is right and THE BIBLE is wrong and we are not going to
fall off a flat earth, after three days the food will be finished. We
will be dying, starving; and that looks far uglier than sudden death. We
will die gradually.”</p><p><br></p><p>So they all gathered – when Columbus was going to sleep – on one ship
in the night, and they thought that the only sane course now was, “We
have tried to persuade Columbus to let us go back. He is not a man who
goes back, he goes only forward. Now we have come to the dangerous point
– in three days the food will be finished. So the only way is, to throw
Columbus into the ocean, get rid of him. Let him swim and find out the
truth – why should we lose our lives? – and we will go back.”</p><p><br></p><p>Columbus, seeing that all ninety people had gathered on one ship – he
was just going to sleep, but he was not asleep – he also went there.
Hiding, he listened to their decision that he was going to be thrown
into the ocean tomorrow. These fools would do it, and he was almost
helpless – a single man against ninety people. He came out of hiding,
went into the meeting – they were very shocked.</p><p>He said, “There is no need to be shocked. Your decision is perfectly
practical. I just want to make a suggestion. It took us two months and
twenty-seven days to reach this place. Do you think in three days you
will be back home?” Even those fools could understand; the logic was
simple. “You cannot go back in three days. But there is a possibility
that in three days we may reach India if we go on and on” – because that
was the idea. One route was open to India; going around Africa and
reaching India – that route was open. They had been been moving in the
opposite direction.</p><p><br></p><p>But they thought, “If we cannot reach Spain, at least we will reach
India.” That was the last known place; between Spain and India was the
whole known world. Columbus’ argument was so solid that they decided to
go on.</p><p>That’s how you are going on with me. You cannot go back! We have
already broken the bridge. The day you took sannyas, the bridge
collapsed. Now you can only go forward.</p><p>And I say to you, just as Columbus reached America in three days.… He
could not reach India. American was not in his mind; it was unknown, a
new land, but he thought he had reached India. That’s why the aboriginal
Americans are called Red Indians. It was Columbus who called them
Indians.</p><p><br></p><p>In three days’ time they saw green leaves floating in the ocean,
birds flying in the sky. And he said to</p><p>his men, “Now don’t be afraid. You can see the birds; trees are not
very far, you can see the leaves</p><p><br></p><p>floating in the ocean. The land is not so far, we will reach it in
three days. Or even if we have to fast for a few days, we are going to
reach.” And strange, within three days they landed.</p><p>The scientist is not skeptical; he has doubts about the outside
world. The truly religious person doubts about the inside world. Both
arrive. The point is that you should go on and on till you arrive,
because you may stop just one step before.</p><p><br></p><p>Columbus gave them a challenge: “In three days you cannot return. I
will allow you, you can go; I will swim, you need not throw me. I will
jump into the ocean myself, I will try to reach without you – but
remember, all you ninety are going to die, and a cowardly death. Be a
little brave, face the situation; come along with me. The earth is
round. We have seen in these past days that there is no horizon – we are
bound to reach land.”</p><p>This was a great challenge to their manliness, to their guts, and
they agreed with Columbus; otherwise there would have been no America.
It was Columbus who doubted THE BIBLE. It was Galileo who doubted THE
BIBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>We are surrounded by fanatical Christians. In America, Oregon is
perhaps one of the most backward, fanatical, unprogressive states. I
have chosen it knowingly, because here is the challenge. And you need a
challenge so that you can become sharp – and you can see it
happening.</p><p>We have in our commune the most intelligent group possible. Just in
the law department of the commune there are four hundred sannyasins.
There is no firm anywhere in the world which has four hundred legal
experts. And there is nothing to lose, we have everything to gain; just
remain courageous. And in four years’ time they have not been able to
make a dent. A small commune has already taken two cities of Oregon.
Wait, more cities will be following! Feel strong – you are, just you
have to remember it. And their opposition goes on hitting you, helping
you to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>And because we are fighting for truth, there may be some small
battles in which we are defeated, but the ultimate victory is ours – and
it is the ultimate victory that counts. Even the greatest warriors have
lost a few small battles. That does not matter. The decision, the
judgment of the Supreme Court yesterday, is a victory; it is not a small
thing.</p><p>The whole of Oregon, except for a few intelligent people, is against
this commune – for no reason at all. We have not harmed them, we don’t
intend to harm anybody. We are so absorbed in ourselves, we don’t care
whether Oregon is there or has disappeared!</p><p><br></p><p>The Supreme Court must have been under great pressure, but they
proved that truth cannot be defeated by any pressure – political lies,
religious fanaticism, just the animal heritage of being afraid of the
new, of the unknown. But the judges could see through all this.</p><p>There is a group in Oregon, “One Thousand Friends of Oregon” – they
were fighting against us. Now, if they have any dignity they should
start calling themselves “One Thousand Enemies of Oregon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Supreme Court and its judges have to be appreciated. They put
aside their Christianity, they put aside the fact that they are
Oregonians, they put aside all kinds of rumors and gossip against us,
and they tried to see the truth. And it was not a single judge – it was
the whole Supreme Court panel. And the decision was not from one man, it
was a unanimous decision of the whole Court.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth may take a little time for its recognition, but finally it has
to be recognized, for the simple reason that it is true.</p><p>Now, can you believe A city exists here, thousands of people are
living here – and for many years it</p><p>had been a wasteland. And it is not a small piece of property, it is
one hundred and twenty-six square miles. It is three times bigger than
New York, two times bigger than San Francisco. And this is the only city
that has supporters all over the world; otherwise, cities don’t have
supporters. It has millions of supporters, sympathizers, lovers.</p><p>In Oregon itself there are thousands of Oregonians who have every
sympathy for you and your commune. But they are afraid of their
neighbors, their community. We receive hundred of letters of support,
but they don’t want their names to be made public. So it is not that the
whole of Oregon is against you, it is only the mob – which has no
intelligence.</p><p>Let them be against us. Their being in opposition is going to help us
in every possible way. It is not only going to help us, it is going to
help democratic values. Our presence here is going to transform the
state of Oregon – because truth is a wildfire. Once recognized, it is
going to burn all opposition. And it is not only Oregon that I am
interested in – it is too small for my interest – we have to awaken the
whole of America, so that democracy is not just a word but becomes a
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The last words of George Gurdjieff were very strange, inconceivable,
but they were addressed to you. Dying, he opened his eyes and said,
“Bravo, America!” Nobody was expecting it. They were thinking he would
give some spiritual guidance departing from the world. And look at him –
he says, “Bravo, America”! But he was not addressing them, he was
addressing you, he was addressing me. He was able to have a vision; he
was one of the enlightened masters of this century.</p><p>America is certainly the very hope for the whole world, but not the
way it is now. Its hypocrisy has to be exposed, and it has to be made
aware: you are not fighting against Soviet Russia, you are fighting
against fascism, nazism, all the anti-democratic values. You are
fighting for individual freedom. Your fight is not just a war against
the Soviet Union, your fight is far more valuable.</p><p>We are fighting for the New Man to be born, and the New Man can be
born only in the new world.</p><p><br></p><p>America is the latest discovery of humanity; that’s why it is called
the New World.</p><p><br></p><p>Old countries have traditions, conventions; their past is heavy. it
is very difficult for them to get rid of it. America has no past– three
hundred years is not much of a past. India has been there, according to
Hindu scholars, for ninety thousand years. India can say she has a past
– ninety thousand years! It is very difficult in India to make a man
free from the programming that has been going on for ninety thousand
years. It is easier in America to deprogram people because they don’t
have much – only three hundred years.</p><p>We have to deprogram America from dirty politics, from fanatic
religions, from all kinds of hypocrisy. It is not a coincidence that
suddenly we have landed here. In nature, in existence, nothing
happens</p><p>accidentally. We have to do something really great for humanity’s
sake.</p><p>Gurdjieff was right: Bravo, America!</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>13</span></p><p><br></p><p>Sympathy is a dirty word</p><p><br></p><p>11 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YESTERDAY, THE WHOLE DAY I SAW MANY SANNYASINS GIVE SYMPATHY TO SWAMI
PREM ANAM AFTER YOUR DISCOURSE. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Sympathy is not compassion; it is just the opposite. Sympathy is a
kind of exploitation of the other person. When you sympathize with
somebody, you are higher, better, and the other is lower, falling,
degraded. Your ego gets immense satisfaction out of sympathy. But this
is how the unconscious mind functions. You don’t know exactly what you
are doing.</p><p>These sannyasins who sympathized with Anam must have been the same
people who had raised their hands here against him. Now, this is
strange. You raise your hands against him, and then you start feeling a
little guilty. When you see him, you want to compensate for the guilt,
so you hug him. And it is an enjoyable moment for you, because the other
is in need of your sympathy. You are the giver, the other is the
beggar.</p><p>If a few of you did it to Anam, it was ugly, inhuman, against the
dignity of an individual. You should have given him your compassion. In
the dictionaries they mean the same, but not in actual life.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion means making the other aware that he is going astray, that
what he has done is not good. You are not putting him down, you are
trying to raise him up. You are not saying, “You are alright as you
are,” you are making it clear: “Something is wrong in your attitude, and
being your</p><p><br></p><p>friend, being part of the commune, it is our duty to draw your
attention to it, so that you can drop that</p><p>attitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is right or wrong, only attitudes. And attitudes can be
dropped, changed. If you were really compassionate you would have made
it more clear to him again and again, all over the commune, wherever he
went. It should have been emphasized, “Your attitude is wrong, and you
are capable of dropping the attitude. We are in total support of you, we
love you, that’s why we want you to drop the attitude.”</p><p>Why did I waste my time on Anam? Do you think I was criticizing him?
Do you think I was saying anything against him? Then you have missed the
point. I love the person, but he can be even more lovable. I love the
person, that’s why I pointed out to him that his attitude will hinder
his growth. Yes, it looks a little hard. But only love can be hard,
because only love can change you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your sympathy was phony, because here you were raising your hands,
and with those same hands you were hugging Anam. Either your raising the
hands was phony, or hugging Anam was phony. You should not have double
faces, that here you show one mask before me, and when you meet Anam you
show another mask. Stop this stupid game, because in this game you are
the loser, a person who is not integrated, who is not one.</p><p><br></p><p>Circumstances may change, but an integrated person remains centered.
You can kill him, but you cannot make him a hypocrite. Anam gave a good
chance to you. I knew it when you were raising your hands – I knew how
many hands were going to hug Anam. Don’t try to be so split. If you
don’t want to raise your hands against him, don’t; raise them against me
– but be true to yourself. If you are really in favor of Anam, then
there is no need to be in favor of me. If you are in favor of Anam, then
you should stand with him. That is the integrated person and his
fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, whomsoever I love I am going to be hard with. I love you
all – any day the hammer can fall on your heads. And I want others to
remember to remind you, “Osho loved you so much; otherwise why should he
bother about you? He loved you, that’s why he picked up a wrong attitude
in you – to purify you, to make you more in tune with the commune, with
the way of life that we are living here.” You will not start doing
something that goes against me, my love.</p><p>The master is hardest on the best disciple – who cares about the
third-rate? I am reminded of a beautiful true story. In India, just in
this century, there was a world-famous painter, Nandalal Bose. He
learned painting from his teacher who was world-famous. The teacher was
none other than the father of Rabindranath Tagore, who won the Nobel
prize for his poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>One day Nandalal painted a beautiful picture of Krishna playing on
the flute. Whatever may be wrong in Krishna, one thing has to be
appreciated – that he has chosen the flute as his symbol, rather than
the cross. The flute reminds you of love, life, songs. The flute reminds
you of the beauties and the wonders and the mysteries of life. It is a
very life-oriented symbol. The cross is a death-oriented symbol.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, around Krishna there is always dance; he is playing on the
flute, and his female lovers are dancing around him. Many things are
wrong in Krishna’s philosophy, but I cannot say that his celebration is
wrong, that his dance is wrong, that his flute is not the right
symbol.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever hear of apostles dancing around Jesus, and Jesus
playing the flute? That is inconceivable. His whole attitude is
death-oriented. Just the other day I said to you that his own disciple –
who was the most intelligent amongst all of his disciples, perhaps more
intelligent than Jesus himself When he saw that Jesus was bent upon
dying, Judas went ahead of him, just like a</p><p>Jew: “He is going to die, he cannot be prevented; crucifixion seems
to be his goal – why not do some business in between?” For thirty silver
pieces Judas sold Jesus to the enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just Jewish – nothing was wrong with Judas. He was an
intelligent man, he used the opportunity. In other circumstances, can
you sell a dead human body for thirty silver pieces? And thirty silver
pieces two thousand years ago was a great amount of money. Red Indians
sold New York for exactly thirty silver pieces to the foreigners who had
invaded it. It was a good price. But Judas loved Jesus. Don’t be
surprised – he loved Jesus, he tried to prevent him, but when he saw the
impossibility, just like a good Jew, he earned some money.</p><p>But when Jesus was crucified, Judas could not forgive himself. Then
repentance overcame him and he started feeling guilty. And do you know,
within twenty-four hours he committed suicide. Judas is condemned all
over the world by the Christians. Nobody looks into that man’s suicide –
why did he commit suicide? He loved Jesus so much, he wanted him to turn
back, not to move towards Jerusalem where nothing but the cross was
waiting for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus did not listen to Judas, and Judas started feeling bad – he
should have made more effort, he should have persuaded him. If it was
needed, he should even have dragged him away from the cross. On the
contrary, he simply proved a Jew, he made a business of it: he sold his
own master. The guilt was so much that he committed suicide. The suicide
was just to compensate for what he had done.</p><p>Nandalal Bose made a beautiful picture of Krishna playing on his
flute, beautiful girls dancing around him. When he came to show it to
his master – Rabindranath was present there – the master looked at the
painting and said, “Nandalal, this kind of third-class painting is not
expected from you.” He threw the painting out of the house, and said to
Nandalal, “In Bengal, on the birthday ceremony of Krishna, thousands of
people paint Krishna’s picture. They are sold very cheap.”</p><p><br></p><p>In Bengal there are many painters who paint only Krishna. They are
called patias, because on a plate – patia and “plate” you can understand
are the same – on a plate of wood, either they carve or they paint. But
those patias, those painters, remain anonymous; nobody comes to know
about them. They are not thought to be great painters. Just by the side
of the road in Calcutta you can find them, selling pictures, paintings,
carvings, for almost nothing. They are poor.</p><p>The master said to Nandalal, “Listen, your painting is not even equal
to the paintings of the patias. Go to the patias and learn how to paint
Krishna.” This was so hard. Nandalal touched the feet of the master and
disappeared. For three years he was moving from one patia to another
patia learning the art, how to paint.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath could not tolerate this. He said to his father, “If you
want to know the truth, the truth is that his painting is better than
the paintings that you have made of Krishna. And your behavior is just
insane!”</p><p><br></p><p>The master laughed, and he said, “Rabindranath, I have to be very
hard on Nandalal. He is my best disciple, and he has much more capacity.
Yes, I know you are right – his painting is far better than my own
paintings, but he has yet much potential. If I had praised his painting,
that potential would have remained just a potential. I want to bring him
to his utmost flowering.” And there were tears in the eyes of the
master; he said, “The job of a master is not easy, and it is not easy
even to understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>After three years Nandalal appeared with a new painting of Krishna.
The master was thrilled. He said, “Now I can say to you, your first
painting was also great, better than my paintings – but this is superb!
Now nobody can transcend this painting. Now I am contented. You had
potential, but a challenge had to be given to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s potential blossoms only when there are challenges.</p><p>I said a few things about Anam. I know he has great potential, and he
is wasting his potential in stupid things. And you sympathized with him!
Do you want him to remain the same as he is? It is not compassion that
you gave him. You were not friends while you were hugging him, you were
enemies. You should have told him, “You have behaved wrongly – this is
not the way to communicate with a master. You are not making bridges
with the master, you are making walls. We have great love for you, but
no sympathy for your attitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>And if he had heard, from thousands of sannyasins, the same thing –
do you think something was not going to happen to him? I hit him hard,
and you hugged him hard and destroyed my whole effort. Receiving your
sympathy, he must have felt great, that everybody is favorable to him.
You have supported his wrong attitude, not him. I was working on him,
destroying his attitude; you did just the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Growth is not child’s play, it is a very conscious effort. And you
all have to be supportive to the person’s innermost being, but never
support any wrong attitude. Supporting the wrong attitude you are
poisoning him, and enjoying your ego. It is a double-edged sword: you
are killing him and you are killing yourself too.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to learn very clearly that if you support any wrong
attitude, sympathize with it, that means you are also carrying something
alike in you. Secondly, you are exploiting the man’s situation, and
becoming holier-than-thou. Thirdly, you are pumping more air into the
balloon of your ego. You are destroying both yourself and the other
person.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also very destructive, but my destruction is devoted to
creation. I am going to destroy so many things in you that unless you
are courageous enough, alert, aware of the fact that my destruction is
of all that which is wrong in you I am doing exactly what a sculptor
does.</p><p>Michelangelo can perhaps be said to be one of the best sculptors of
the whole history. He has made statues of Jesus so beautiful, so
alive... even Jesus was not so alive nor so beautiful. The case is
otherwise; there are ancient scriptures describing Jesus as an ugly man.
Perhaps it may be an exaggeration by his enemies, but there must be some
truth in it. At the best, he was just homely.</p><p><br></p><p>But Michelangelo has created such beautiful statues One of his
statues of Jesus a few years ago</p><p>was destroyed by an atheist. It was in St. Peter’s Cathedral in the
Vatican. Nobody had ever thought</p><p><br></p><p>that it had to be guarded! It was available for everybody to see.
Just to be close to that statue was an experience – but one atheist
destroyed it.</p><p>He was caught. Because he had destroyed one of the most beautiful
things that man has created, he</p><p>was asked, “Why have you destroyed it?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am against God, I am against Jesus, I am against
religion. That statue, although just a</p><p>piece of marble, was creating in many people something which can only
be called religiousness.”</p><p>And do you know how Michelangelo found that piece of marble, that big
rock? It was lying in front of a shop which had sold marble for years.
Nobody had asked for it. Just to create a space in his shop, the
shopkeeper moved the rock to the other side of the road, and it was
lying there.</p><p><br></p><p>One day Michelangelo, passing along that road, saw the rock. He
enquired of the shopkeeper, “To whom does it belong?”</p><p>The shopkeeper said, “Do you want it?” Michelangelo said, “Yes,
absolutely.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Take it – without any charge. I want to get rid of it.” And
out of that ugly marble rock, which no artist had even looked at... and
it was given to Michelangelo free, so some space would be created for
other rocks. It was a big rock, and out of that rock Michelangelo
created this statue, which was destroyed three or four years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>When the statue was completed, he asked the shopkeeper to come and
see. The shopkeeper could</p><p>not believe his eyes. He said, “You are a magician. What have you
made out of that rock?”</p><p>The answer of Michelangelo is worth remembering. He said, “I have not
created Jesus out of that rock. He was already there; I have only taken
away unnecessary parts that were hiding him. Only the unnecessary has
been removed, and the real which was lying within is now available to
you. I have not created the rock, I have only destroyed those parts
which were hindering the reality of the rock from your vision.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s my work. You come to me just like a rock, with no face of your
own, with no being of your own, with no centering, no grounding, no
integrity, no individuality. I have to cut much; perhaps the major part
that is hanging around you has to be cut.</p><p>It hurts, because you have been under the illusion that it is you.
But when you come to see – if you go on hanging around me – one day,
when all that is not part of you is eliminated and your reality is
revealed to you and to others too, you will feel grateful. And then you
will understand why I hit so hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I am chiseling, hammering all that is ugly in you, all that has been
given to you by your society, by your culture, by your civilization. I
want to discover in you your original face.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever I hammer on somebody, nobody is to show sympathy. Be a
little more compassionate. Sympathy is a dirty word; be a little more
compassionate. Help the man to understand that whatever I have said is
creative, is to bring out his nature, his purity. And if you all go on
making the man</p><p><br></p><p>aware, there is a possibility that he will start thinking, “If so
many people are saying it, there must be something in it.”</p><p>But your sympathy destroyed... you washed out all that I had done. So
when you see Anam again, take your sympathy back and tell him clearly,
“That sympathy was bogus, unconscious, and what has been said is not
against you” – what purpose have I to be against anybody? – “it was for
your growth. We were wrong to sympathize with you. Our sympathy will
strengthen your attitude, because you will think if so many people are
with you, you must be right.” So change it. Make it clear to him, “We
were wrong to sympathize, and you were wrong in your attitude.”</p><p>I was working for years individually, but then I thought, how many
people can I reach? – and I was continuously traveling up to 1970. So I
could go on saying things, but it was not going to bring a
transformation in people.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to create a commune, where whatever I say is not just lost, but
is echoed from everybody else too, from all sides and dimensions. And
the person finds himself thinking, “So many people, friends, lovers,
cannot be wrong.”</p><p>You have to help me in creating the New Man. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHATEVER THE QUESTION, YOUR ANSWER SEEMS TO BE THE SAME. HOW LONG
WILL THIS GO ON BEFORE WE UNDERSTAND?</p><p>As long as you wish. As far as I am concerned, this very moment it
can happen. It is not a question of time, it is a question of intense
understanding.</p><p>It is true: whatever the question, my answer is the same, because
there are not many questions, they are just phrased in different
ways.</p><p>But the question also is one: you don’t know who you are. You are
absolutely in darkness – unaware of your glory, your divinity, your
beauty, your truth. All the questions differ only in phrasing.
Naturally, I have to phrase my answers also according to your
question.</p><p>Somebody has counted through my books and found that I have answered
ten thousand questions. My answer is one. I have not answered ten
thousand questions, and I have not given you ten thousand answers. Your
question is one, but you have asked it in ten thousand ways. My answer
is one; just not to spoil the game I have answered you in ten thousand
ways, hoping that perhaps, sometime, in a certain moment of silence, in
a certain way, you may catch hold of the one answer.</p><p>How long you are going to miss, that depends on you. You have to
receive it. I cannot give it to you, you have to take it.</p><p>Gurdjieff’s disciples were very puzzled about his statements. One of
his statements which has been puzzling his disciples – there are still a
few disciples of Gurdjieff in the world – was, “Unless you are capable
of stealing the truth from the master, you will never get it.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing puzzling about it. I am saying “You have to take it”
just not to puzzle you. In fact, you have to steal it. It is just in
front of you. The doors are open, nobody is guarding it, but you are
keeping your eyes closed. It all depends on you. Open your eyes and see
the light. Turn your back towards darkness, turn your face towards
light. But you are standing just in the opposite way: facing a darkness
that centuries have made denser and denser, darker and darker.</p><p>If you go on looking at this darkness of millions of years, you are
bound to think you are blind. And what is the point of opening your
eyes, even if you are not blind? It is better to keep your eyes closed
and dream of some beautiful things. What is the point of looking into
the abysmal darkness? – and that is what your Christianity is, your
Hinduism is, your Mohammedanism is.</p><p><br></p><p>All the cultures and all the civilizations have been created to
destroy the individual in you, and to create phony personality in you,
and make you so much attached to the phony personality that you start
thinking, “This is my individuality.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have to hammer hard on your personality. It is going to hurt, but
there is no other way. If you want not to be hammered, drop the
personality yourself. Who is Anam? – just a personality. Who are you? –
whatever people have said about you.</p><p>Women are known all over the world for continually looking in the
mirror. The more idiotic of them carry a mirror in their bag too. What
do they go on seeing in a mirror? The mirror cannot reflect your
individuality – for that you need a master. The mirror can only reflect
your personality; it cannot reflect your being, your center, but only
your circumference.</p><p><br></p><p>And women go on looking again and again. Once is enough – but how to
be certain? Somewhere deep down you know perfectly well that that which
is mirrored is not you, but you want to be convinced that it is you. And
you go on decorating your personality – your hairdo, your lipstick. It
is very strange.</p><p><br></p><p>To have red lips out of health is totally different to just painting
them with lipstick. Who are you going to deceive? You cannot deceive
even yourself. And this is not only true of children and young people; I
see old women, who should have been in their graves by now, still
painting their lips, putting on false eyelashes.</p><p><br></p><p>Your personality is your creation. The society gives you all the
incentives to create it, because phony people can be enslaved. Phony
people can be Americans, Indians, Arabians, Chinese. Phony people will
go to the church, to the mosque, to the synagogue.</p><p>The real individual finds his synagogue, his mosque, his temple,
inside himself. He need not go anywhere. Whenever he wants to have a
taste of that indefinable phenomenon, he just goes in. And just to be
there is enough religion. More than that is not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>There is your silence, there is your peace. There is your blessing,
there is your ecstasy.</p><p>There is your love – the whole treasure, the whole kingdom of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>Hammering on your personality, I am trying to turn your attention
from the personality towards the individuality. So please remember,
whenever I hit somebody’s head, you are not to sympathize; you are not
to put ointment on his head. And the person who gets the hit should feel
grateful that he has been chosen, that he has been thought worthy, that
he deserved a hit from the master. So whatever you have done with Anam,
you have to undo. Anam has to be brought to his real, beautiful
being.</p><p>And I had to create a commune, because alone, how many people can I
hit? And their skulls are so thick that small hits once in a while don’t
matter. Here, you are thousands of sannyasins. Whatever I am doing, you
all have to take part in it, you all have to help me.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to be completely free from personality, because that
means you are free from religion, you are free from culture, you are
free from civilization, you are free from nationality, you are free from
other kinds of ideologies. They are all part of your personality. Your
individuality is just pure ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>So this should never happen again. And those who have hugged Anam
should say to him, “Give it back – and we are sorry that we did
something wrong to you. We love you, but we cannot love your stupidity,
we cannot love your insanity.”</p><p>Then only will the commune become a real organism, functioning in
tune. Then only can there be a strange and new music, an unknown
fragrance surrounding you and this holy land. This land is the same
everywhere. It is the people who live on the land, who by their living
meditatively, joyously, lovingly, consciously, not only transform
themselves, they transform the whole atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>Jerusalem is not the holy land; perhaps once it was. Mecca and Medina
are no longer holy lands; perhaps once they were. Bodh Gaya is no longer
a holy land. It was once, but twenty-five centuries have passed since
Buddha meditated, lived with his disciples in Bodh Gaya; it was a holy
land.</p><p>If you remove the barrier of the personality, holiness suddenly
explodes. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN MY HEART. IT POUNDS WHEN YOU ARE NEAR. IT
IS HAPPENING TO MANY OF US. WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p><p>This is the happening for which I am here, you are here. It has no
name. Call it just “happening.” It is</p><p>immensely beautiful. When your heart starts pounding, that means your
heart is close to my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a sign to you that the mind is left far behind, that you are no
longer thinking but feeling, that you are no longer doing anything; it
is happening. In the beginning you may get scared because it is so new.
You may think something is going wrong – why is my heart pounding? – but
only in the beginning. Just allow it, don’t try to stop it. Enjoy it,
rejoice in it. This is communion, heart to heart.</p><p>There comes a moment when your heart pounds, beats in exactly the
same rhythm, in the same frequency as my heart. Immediately there is a
meeting. And that meeting brings transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>The master cannot do anything. He can only create certain devices in
which the happening becomes possible. This commune is a device;
otherwise there was no need for it. You were living somewhere, everybody
was doing something. To take you out of your houses, your families, your
cities – what is the purpose? The purpose is that if so many hearts
start beating in the same rhythm and frequency, others whose hearts are
not beating but whose heads are circling may catch the fire. It simply
jumps like wildfire from one tree to another tree.</p><p><br></p><p>I know a few people are in tune with me. That makes it easier for
others to be tuned in with me. All these hearts together become a
tremendous force. If five thousand people can be in one rhythm, in one
frequency, they may create such great energy that it will start
spreading around the world.</p><p>That’s why I have created communes in so many countries. I want all
those communes to be exactly like this place, because I will not be
there. The governments are making it impossible for me to go
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>In India it was happening, just a very strange thing: in Poona the
people were exploiting my sannyasins. For those seven years I was there,
prices of everything had gone up ten times – only in Poona! A house that
was available for twenty thousand dollars was not available even for one
hundred thousand dollars. And seven thousand sannyasins were almost
always there, and at moments there were ten thousand, fifteen thousand.
All the hotels were full, overfull. People were renting houses, giving
enormous amounts of money. They were becoming paying guests, giving
enormous amounts of money.</p><p>So on the one hand the Hindu chauvinist mind was against me, because
whatever I am doing goes absolutely against any kind of chauvinistic
attitude – Hindu, Mohammedan or Christian – and on the other hand they
were very happy that I was there. They were pressurizing the government
of the state that I should not be given any land in the state; I should
be living in Poona. Poona knew if I moved to some other place, all the
beauty, the joy, the money – particularly the money – would
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The Maharashtra government was preventing my moving from Poona. They
found a way to prevent me. They would not say – politicians are cunning,
they would not say, “You cannot go out of Poona”; that is against
freedom. They continued to say, “You can find a place and you can go
there,” but in that place they would create trouble so that people in
that place would start being aggressive and protesting that I should not
be allowed to be given any land close to them.</p><p>The Maharashtra government was enjoying, and greatly, because they
have never seen so many tourists coming to Bombay airport. Now my
secretary has just been there; you cannot find any tourists. And poor
countries like India have much investment in tourism. So the Maharashtra
government was forcing the central government, saying, “You should not
give any place to Osho, because Maharashtra does not want to lose its
tourism.”</p><p><br></p><p>The central government was being wishy-washy, always saying “We are
giving you this land and that land.” It went on for seven years
continually. They would not allow us to purchase more houses in Poona
either, because they were afraid that if thousands of people who belong
to me started living in Poona, they would take it over. And certainly,
it would have happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Poona ashram was not in the name of the Foundation. We paid
prices ten times more than anybody else, yet the government did not put
those houses in our name. It was a very strange situation: we were
paying the taxes, we were paying the electricity bills – and the houses
were not in our name! We had given the money to the previous owners, but
the houses remained in the name of those owners.</p><p>They were afraid that if a great commune happened, Poona’s whole
character, its whole atmosphere, would change. And they were afraid of
that. Poona is a very Hindu-minded city. It is a strange coincidence
that the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi was from Poona, and the man who
attempted to kill me was also from Poona. This is strange, because both
these people belonged to the same political party. I have always been
against Gandhism, but the political party that killed Gandhi... the same
people tried to kill me. I am not a Gandhian, I am absolutely and
totally against Gandhi and his ideology.</p><p><br></p><p>But the moment the knife was thrown at me, I could see the hesitancy
in the minds of Poona people. On the one hand they wanted to exploit all
these people; on the other hand they were afraid these people would
destroy their so-called culture – which is already dead. There is
nothing to destroy; the dead culture just has to be dragged to the
crematorium.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who threw the knife must have been of the same dual mind. The
whole of Poona was of the same dual mind: they could neither allow me to
move out, nor could they allow me to grow vast. He threw the knife, and
the knife fell nearabout twelve feet away from me. I was surprised! One
can miss the target, but not by twelve feet.</p><p><br></p><p>It shows something in the psychology of the man. He represented the
whole Poona-Hindu mind. He wanted to kill me, and yet he wanted me to
remain there. So he did both things together: to satisfy himself and the
Poona people he threw the knife, but it fell twelve feet away from
me.</p><p>I cannot go to another country, they have taken precautions. In
Germany, they have put a lawsuit against me – I have never been in
Germany! They have filed a case in the court to prevent my coming; if I
go to Germany I will be arrested, and I will not be able to leave
Germany till the litigation is over.</p><p>It is natural: the creation of a new milieu for growing individuals
is bound to be opposed by everybody in the world. But there is nothing
to be worried about. In fact, their opposition keeps us growing stronger
and stronger. But they don’t know that. They are not intelligent enough
to know either.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians are always mediocre, because to be in politics you don’t
need any qualifications except that you can be cunning, a hypocrite,
expert in lying. And these things are not taught in any university, you
don’t get any degrees in them. Politics is the only job where no
qualification is needed. In fact, an intelligent person will not degrade
himself by getting into politics. He can do far more and better things;
why should he be sitting foolishly in a parliament, arguing about
trivia?</p><p>For months, what do these people in the parliaments and the
assemblies go on doing? It is just a kind of insane chattering club.
About small things they go on arguing. The whole world is on fire, and
they go on talking about land use laws. The attorney general of Oregon,
the governor or Oregon, the “One Thousand Enemies of Oregon” – they are
trying to prove that if Rajneeshpuram becomes a legal city it will go
against land use laws. Can you think... are these people sane?</p><p><br></p><p>This land has not been used for many decades: no use is perfectly
good use! We have made this land productive, and we are going to make it
more and more productive; this is misuse, it is against land use laws.
The Oregon Supreme Court has proved to be saner.</p><p>Anybody can see a simple thing, that we have made a wasteland a
beautiful oasis; they should be grateful to us. But the fear is that if
this commune becomes a great power, it is going to create a wildfire all
around. And they cannot ignore us. Nobody can ignore us.</p><p><br></p><p>But before they woke up to the fact, we had already made the commune,
the city was incorporated. Now there is no way of going back. And my
people are always going forward. We are going to make this place – for
the first time – a real holy land.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS? OR DO THINGS JUST HAPPEN AROUND YOU? CAN YOU
GIVE SOME EXAMPLES?</p><p><br></p><p>I have never done anything in my life. Even my shoes... Vivek puts
them on my feet. You can’t conceive of a more lazy man than me. You must
be thinking, why do I cross one leg over the other and never change it?
It is sheer laziness, it is not some yoga posture. I don’t even put the
watch on my wrist; that is Vivek’s job. She puts it on me, she
chooses.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never done anything in my life, but millions of things have
gone on happening around me. I cannot take the credit for those
happenings.</p><p>Existence is not an act, a creation by a God; existence is an
autonomous happening. Nobody is behind the curtain pulling the strings,
sending messengers, holy books; there is nobody. Existence functions as
an autonomous happening.</p><p>That day, thirty-two years ago, I became aware of the fact that even
my birth was a happening. I have</p><p>not had anything to do with it. In fact, nobody had asked me, “Do you
want to be born?”</p><p><br></p><p>My breathing goes on happening – it is wrong to say that I am
breathing. You are not breathing; otherwise you would have been dead
long ago, because what will you do in the night? When you are asleep,
the breathing will stop; or sometimes even in the day you may forget,
and you are finished.</p><p>I trust in existence – I am part of it. And the moment I became aware
that if stars go on moving without any mover behind them, if this whole
vast existence is possible without any doer I am just a</p><p>small, tiny part of this whole existence, why should I bother doing
anything? Let things happen. And so much has happened that sometimes
even I start wondering whether it has happened or somebody has done
it.</p><p><br></p><p>But I have been continuously aware – aware that I am not going to do
anything, because the ego is the doer. If you don’t do anything, the ego
disappears; doing is nourishing the ego. Shifting from doing to
happening, you have dissolved the ego. In doing you can fail, but in
happening there is no</p><p><br></p><p>way of failing. Whatsoever happens is right. So nobody can make me
depressed, nobody can make me disappointed, because in the first place I
am not trying to do something.</p><p>Do you think that when I speak I move my hands? No, my gestures are
just a happening, there is no doer behind them. My gestures are not the
gestures of a Christian missionary.</p><p>I used to go to visit<span class=s6></span>In Jabalpur there was
Asia’s biggest training center for Christian missionaries,</p><p>Leonard Theological College. Thousands of people were being trained
how to become a missionary. I used to go – the principal was my friend,
but that was just an excuse – I used to go there to see how stupid
people can be.</p><p>The professors were teaching the students how to speak – when you
have to speak slowly, when you have to shout loudly – and when you are
speaking what gestures are suitable: when you have to raise your hand,
when you have to hit the desk to make a point. I was simply amazed.
These are actors, these are not missionaries; they are being
trained.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how to speak; you cannot find a more amateur speaker in
the world. I don’t know what I am going to say the next moment. My hands
move on their own. In fact, the hands are extensions of your brain; your
right hand is connected with your left brain, your left hand is
connected with your right brain. They are in tune with my brain, so
whatever gesture is there, it is not my doing. And the brain is a
mechanism, it is not me.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am going to say, I don’t know; I simply allow it to be said.
That’s why it is so easy for me to go</p><p>on speaking for years – there is no problem. These are no prepared
speeches.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day Vivek was very amazed In the morning, after my
bath and taking my breakfast,</p><p>which is nothing much, just a glass of juice.… I am always in such a
beautiful relaxed state that although I have slept the whole night –
that was also beautiful – after my bath I can fall asleep again. I have
to come here, so I have to leave at eight-fifteen. Vivek came and she
saw me fast asleep. She woke me up, and she said, “It is now
eight-twenty. Your secretary is waiting outside, and you are sleeping!”
So just out of sleep I come here and start. But there is no doing in my
life.</p><p><br></p><p>You all have come to me, I have not called you. Just think, your
coming to me was a happening. Your being here with me is nothing like
doing. Anybody who is here with effort is not going to remain here long.
Only those who are here simply as a happening are going to be with me
forever. And to me, each moment is an eternity unto itself.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are with me without any effort, without any doing on your
part, you have fallen in tune with me, because I am just happening. If
you are also in the mood of happening, suddenly there is no duality
between me and you. Two happenings are not two; a thousand happenings
are not a thousand. If all the sannyasins here are here without any
effort and are just enjoying whatever is happening, then we are one
soul.</p><p>Why does one have to make an effort? – because deep down one does not
want to be here, that’s why one has to make an effort to be here. How
long can you repress your going away, and why waste your time in
repressing? If that is your destiny to go away, go away with joy, with
all my blessings.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is a happening to you, then there is no question ever of
saying, “Be here with all my blessings.” You will know it without my
saying it. I will be overflowing in you, you will be reaching me. And
this will be an absolutely invisible phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>14</span></p><p><br></p><p>We are here to be whole</p><p><br></p><p>12 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF BEING A RAJNEESHEE AND LIVING IN A
COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible. I am simply an individual who belongs to no
religion, to no caste, to no cult, to no nation. And I cannot belong to
anybody, for the simple reason that I am completely content with myself.
The desire to belong arises because you feel empty. In a crowd of any
kind – political, religious – you forget your emptiness; the crowd fills
you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible also because I am no longer seeking, searching for
anything – existence has opened all its doors to me. I cannot even say
that I belong to existence, because I am just part of it. If you are not
part of it, then in some way you create a relationship, a belonging.</p><p><br></p><p>When a flower blossoms, I blossom with it. When the sun rises, I rise
with it.</p><p>The ego in me, which keeps people separate, is no longer there. I am
dissolved – who can belong? I am not there. My body is part of nature,
my being is part of the whole. I am not a separate entity.</p><p>When you are a separate entity, there is fear. The universe is vast,
the problems are immense. You would like a family to belong to, a
community, a society, a culture, a religion. Alone you cannot</p><p><br></p><p>face the vast emptiness surrounding you. Alone you are so small in
comparison to the expanding universe – great fear arises.</p><p>But when you start belonging to a big crowd, the fear is diluted. So
people belong to the family, they belong to a society, they belong to a
culture, they belong to a church. And if even that is not fulfilling,
then they create Rotary clubs, Lions clubs, the “One Thousand Enemies of
Oregon.” The bigger the crowd, the bigger you start imagining yourself
to be. If you are a Catholic, you know there are six hundred million
Catholics – you become huge.</p><p>I have no fear, because the one that could have fear has disappeared
long ago. Even here, you are Rajneeshees, I am not. In fact, in my whole
life I have never belonged to anything. I have been just a guest
everywhere – even here I am simply a guest. Even my guesthouse is not
within the boundaries of Rajneeshpuram.</p><p><br></p><p>I am just an outsider, but to be an outsider and contented,
fearless... because death cannot destroy me, there is nothing to be
destroyed. My death has already happened thirty-two years ago; this is
my posthumous existence. Any moment the body can fall apart, and I will
be part of the whole. And remember, being part of the whole is not the
same as being part of a machine, an organization. The words are the
same, but in reality, to be part of the whole means to be the whole.
There is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>To be part of any kind of mechanism is not to be the whole mechanism.
In your machines, cars, you can change a part because the part is really
apart – you can take it out and put in another part. It was not the
whole machine.</p><p><br></p><p>But to be part of the whole is totally different. You are
irreplaceable. The stars are within you, just as you are within the
universe. The universe is within you; there is no demarcation line.</p><p>And this is my whole message to you:</p><p><br></p><p>Dissolve, be in a state of let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is no death, then there is no fear. Then you are not
alone, the whole universe is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody who is awakened to the truth becomes an outsider to all kinds
of collectivities. Gautam Buddha is not a Buddhist, Mahavira is not a
Jaina, Jesus is not a Christian. There have been very few individuals in
history who were part of the whole. Nothing less than that will do.
Everything else is just a poor substitute.</p><p><br></p><p>When I can have a friendship with the flowers and the trees and the
birds and the stars, when I can love the smallest blade of grass and the
biggest star – because they are mine and I am theirs – then what is the
need to belong to a small, tiny group?</p><p><br></p><p>I am making every effort so that you dissolve, so that you start
melting into the whole, so that slowly, slowly you forget yourself and
only remember the reality that surrounds you. Just as a dewdrop falls
from the lotus leaf into the lake and becomes one with the lake,
thirty-two years ago my dewdrop slipped from the lotus leaf into the
lake of wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>I am no more. Whatever I say to you is the voice of the whole; hence,
I am not worried about respectability or notoriousness. I am not worried
about anything, because the worrier is not there. I am not even
responsible. I have dropped myself into the whole; now the
responsibility is of the whole. This is exactly the case with everyone,
but you have to remember it. You have forgotten – you have been made to
forget it.</p><p>In this commune slowly, slowly merge, melt, if the universe seems too
vast and scares you. The purpose of the commune is to give you an
opportunity that does not scare you. Melt! Don’t be a part of this
commune, become the whole commune. Each individual in this commune is
the whole commune.</p><p><br></p><p>This will give you a glimpse of dissolving, and if with such a small
commune dissolving brings such great blessings, you will know the
secret, from where it is coming. Then why remain stuck? You know the key
– you can open the doors of the whole universe for yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>A commune is only a small experiment, a kind of rehearsal where you
can dissolve without any fear. Once you know how to dissolve, melt, you
have known all; the same has to be done with the whole. And the
paradoxical phenomenon is, when you dissolve in the whole, the whole
dissolves in you. You don’t lose anything; you gain the whole universe!
Perhaps you lose your chains, bondages, you lose your small, cozy,
egoistic existence. But when you have the whole existence melting in
you, who cares for small things?</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the only university. The other universities are teaching
you to become strong egos. They are not universities, because the
university should teach you to become one with the universe. That is the
meaning of the word “university.” I don’t know what kind of idiots go on
creating language. They create a university to strengthen your ego; they
are against the universe.</p><p>In my way of seeing, they should call all the universities of the
world – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, all the universities of the world –
they should stop calling them universities; they are multiversities.
There is nothing like unity with existence; they are making you more and
more solid, crystallized, separate from everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>This university is exactly what the word means. We are not here to be
part, we are here to be the whole. And when you can be the whole, it
will be sheer stupidity to remain a part.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t belong to anything, because to belong means separation. I am
in everything, and everything is in me.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY HAVEN’T PEOPLE FROM AFRICA COME TO YOU? MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO
COME ARE WHITE-SKINNED. TO ME, WHAT YOU SAY IS FOR EVERYONE. ARE THE
OTHERS AFRAID OF YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true, what I say is for everyone. But everyone is not ready for
it.</p><p><br></p><p>We have become accustomed to dividing the world into East and West.
It has to be changed – we should start conceiving of the world as
divided into North and South. East and West is not a true division,
because the eastern people and the western people are all different
shades of whiteness. They come from the same root, the same race – the
Aryans. Their languages can prove it very easily.</p><p>All the languages of East and West are sister languages; their roots
are derived from a single source, Sanskrit. The words may have taken
different shapes, changes – a little bit here, a little bit there – but
if you are careful you can figure out what has happened to each
word.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of a few words of East and West, and you will see they are
not separate people. You call man’s first beginning, Adam. Arabians call
him Dum, Indians call him Admi. Do you see any difference?</p><p>Sometimes words take such a turn that suddenly you cannot see they
are one. The first woman, you call Eve. In many languages she is called
Eve. In Arabic she is called Hava. Now “Hava” and “Eve” seem to be two
different words; they are not. “Eve” and “Hava” may seem very different,
but if you go through all the intermediate steps: Eve, Eve, Hava – just
one link, and you know this is the same language.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not true about South and North; their languages are not
connected at all. They are totally different evolutions happening on the
earth.</p><p>Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed, Moses, Jesus – they are all born
in the northern regions. All the religions are born in the North; there
is nothing comparable in the South. All the scientists are born in the
North; there is nothing comparable in the South.</p><p><br></p><p>The South is living at least five thousand years behind. They are
still living in the world of magic – science is very far away. Even your
so-called religions have not evolved there. If in the South there are
Christians it is because you have converted them, bribed them with
education, food, better clothing, better possibilities to rise higher on
the ladder of prestige, power, respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>In the South there are Mohammedans; they have also been converted –
at the point of the sword. Mohammedanism in a way is very straight and
direct. Why go in roundabout ways: teaching, feeding, giving clothes,
education, sending people to learn in England, in France, in America –
too long a route. They take a shortcut. They just put their sword on
your neck, and they say, “Decide. You can live only as a Mohammedan, so
choose between Mohammedanism and death.” It is not a question of
choosing between two religions, it is a question of choosing between
Mohammedanism and death. And naturally, one chooses Mohammedanism.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me why people from Africa are not coming to me. Now,
what can I do? You should go to Africa and ask those people!</p><p>But I can see why they are not coming. There is a gap of five
thousand years between you and them. I am saying, “between you and them”
– the gap between me and them is immeasurable, you cannot calculate it.
Even the northern white people find a great gap between me and them –
what to say about the poor black people of southern Africa? They are
still worshipping the magician, they</p><p><br></p><p>still believe in superstitions which were prevalent all over the
world in the past. They are still groping in the dark.</p><p>The southern hemisphere needs to be transformed. But it is so
difficult even to transform the northern people, who have been thinking
for thousands of years, have created great philosophies, theologies,
religions. You cannot name a single person from southern Africa who can
be compared to Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. You cannot, because it has
not happened. There has been no Kant, no Hegel, no Feuerbach. There has
been no Martin Heidegger, Jaspers, Jean-Paul Sartre. And to understand
me, you need this whole background.</p><p><br></p><p>It will look strange to you, that what I am criticizing continually
and destroying continually is a basic need as a background to understand
me.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot criticize Jesus to a southern African. What does it mean to
him? Jesus has nothing to do with him. I cannot criticize Aristotle, he
has never heard the name. So I can go on criticizing Aristotle, it is
not going to make any dent; it is not his heritage. That’s why they are
not coming.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you blossom, and your fragrance spreads, it will not be far in
the future that even the Africans will be able to walk along with you.
Right now, it is almost impossible. Your problems are different from
their problems; your background is different from their background;
otherwise, there is not much difference. As human beings there is no
difference except the color.</p><p>The black people of South Africa are a little richer in color than
the white people, because they have something more that you don’t have.
They have a certain color pigment – not very valuable, maybe one-third
of a dollar; that color pigment in their bodies is the only thing they
have more than you. And it is an absolute necessity there – the sun is
so burning hot that unless the body is black, it will not be able to
survive.</p><p>In India, I know India is something in between: the skin is not as
white as German nordics, but it</p><p>is not as black as southern Africans, because India’s climate does
not need that pigment which</p><p>prevents sunrays from entering into the body.</p><p><br></p><p>India was under British rule for two hundred years. For the people
who had come from England, it was a suffering; India was too hot. Delhi
is one of the hottest places in India, and that was the capital. So the
British government made another capital in Simla, in the Himalayas; it
was the summer capital. As the summer came, all the British people would
move to Simla – the whole capital. They could not even survive in New
Delhi. The moment India became independent, Simla was no longer a summer
capital; the Indian skin can take the heat of Delhi.</p><p><br></p><p>So the only difference is of a little color pigment. Scientifically,
I think it would be possible to inject you with the pigment and you
would become black; or to find some way to take out the black pigment
from the African, and he would be as white as you are – or even more,
because he would be fresh. But then he could not survive in Africa, or
he would have to make different arrangements to survive. Except for the
color there is no difference, they are human beings just like you. But
they have evolved in a different way from the North.</p><p><br></p><p>The North – particularly India – has created almost all the best
religions. Compared to Jainism and Buddhism, Christianity and
Mohammedanism look very childish. The reason was, India was</p><p><br></p><p>affluent, rich; there was no poverty as it exists now. Twenty-five
centuries ago India was known all over the world as a golden bird. It
attracted all kinds of thieves to exploit that gold. Those who came –
Moguls, Turks, Mongols, Hunas, Portuguese, French, English – they were
all thieves in search of the riches that were available in India.</p><p>India never attacked anybody – there was no reason. A rich man never
goes to steal in a poor man’s hut, that is absolutely absurd. If the
poor man goes to the rich man’s house to steal, it is absolutely
logical. India never attacked any country; it was attacked by almost
everybody. In twenty- five centuries they exploited everything India
had. They were parasites; they have left India almost in a the situation
of a skeleton. But in those good old days, India created the best
philosophers.</p><p>Yes, even now, when the West is so rich, affluent, its philosophers
cannot compare with the Indian philosophers of two, three thousand years
ago – Nagarjuna, Shankara, Nimbark. Even today Sartre, Jaspers, Russell,
have much to learn from these people. The country was so satisfied
physically that it started groping for some spiritual nourishment.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed was a poor man, illiterate; so was Jesus a poor man,
illiterate. Buddha was not a poor man and illiterate. He was a prince,
the only son of his father; soon he was going to be crowned. He was
educated in the best possible way, he was acquainted with all the wisdom
available. His intelligence was sharpened in every possible way...
because in India, philosophy has developed differently than it has
developed in Europe.</p><p><br></p><p>It was developed not by writing philosophic treatises, it was
developed by wandering philosophers arguing all over the country,
debating, discussing, winning. And the rule of the game was that whoever
wins in an argument becomes the master of the person who is defeated.
And the defeated person – not in any sadness, but with great joy –
surrenders to the master, because the question is not who is winning,
the question is: What is true? And if this man has a better insight into
truth, then there is no reason to be sad and sorrowful that you are
defeated. You have found a better mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Indian philosophers moving all over the country, arguing, sharpened
the mind of the whole nation. They were not just sitting in their rooms
and writing books, like Immanuel Kant or Wilhelm Hegel. That cannot give
you that sharpness.</p><p>I know it from my own experience. For thirty years I was traveling in
India – arguing, fighting, challenging. I know that under that
challenge, argument, your capacity, which ordinarily remains dormant,
becomes active. Your intelligence, under the pressure of challenge,
functions perfectly. It is a question of life and death.</p><p><br></p><p>The southern hemisphere is lagging behind – poor, uneducated. And the
gap is big – five thousand</p><p>years at least. That’s why it is very difficult for them to commune
with me.</p><p>Even negroes in America who have been here for two hundred years,
three hundred years They</p><p>go on writing questions to me, “You criticize Christianity, but you
never talk about the religions of southern Africa.” There is no religion
there – and I am not fighting magic, I am not a magician. Red Indians of
America go on writing questions to me, “What about our religion?” You
don’t have any. What you have is so primitive that I am not going to
waste my time on it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so difficult to convince the white races of the world. They are
the most progressive, yet to convince them to drop all programs and
conditionings is so difficult. And even if a man drops them, listens to
my argument, understands the argument, that understanding mostly remains
intellectual. And the question is: how am I going to reach your
heart?</p><p>The Christian clergyman was from Sweden. He was under great pressure
and trouble in Sweden because he was spreading my message there. He was
giving my books to people he thought would understand. He created a
great stir in Sweden – all the Christian churches condemned him and his
congregation, saying that he was trying to destroy Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>He continued to fight; in newspapers, on television, on radio, he was
arguing. But coming here this year, he fell flat on the ground and
forgot that he was giving my message to the Christians – because he had
never heard me speak against Christianity. He was thinking that what I
am saying I commented on Jesus and the Christians were surprised. I
received so many letters from</p><p>Christian clergymen around the world: “The way you have explained the
words of Jesus, we had</p><p>never thought we never knew that Jesus was such a great philosopher,
and that what he said has</p><p>so many implications.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now they all know: I was simply speaking for myself, my own ideas,
using Jesus’ name – for a simple reason. I have done that with Hindus,
with Mohammedans, with Christians – because from where else to get my
congregation? So first I spoke on Jesus, choosing only those parts which
I can support. Now I have my own people, and I don’t care a bit. Now I
am going to tell you the whole truth!</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing the whole truth, that clergyman freaked out. I can understand
his trouble. Now he will be torn apart in Sweden, because the Swedish
orthodox Christians will be against him, and he cannot any longer go on
propagating my word. And if he stops propagating my word, then the
people who have come to him because of me will be against him. I have
put him in a real fix. Now it is a question of either/or; he has to
choose. That’s why he said, “You have given me moments of heaven and
moments of hell.”</p><p>First I give everybody moments of heaven. When I see that you are
getting in tune with me, then I give you the moments of hell, because I
have to destroy all the garbage that centuries have poured upon you.
Unless you are completely free from all prejudices, you cannot open your
heart to me. And I am not interested in your head; I am searching for
your heart, because real religiousness is not a matter of the head.</p><p><br></p><p>Science is a matter of the head, it has nothing to do with the heart.
Religion is a matter absolutely concerned with your heart. Unless your
heart starts beating with me, in tune, nothing is held back, you are
totally and utterly harmonious with me only then can I bring you to the
vision where this</p><p>whole universe is yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you know there is no death, everything is eternal; nothing dies,
things only change forms. Then you know the universe is not static; it
is moving, alive, breathing. It is not standing still, it is progressing
every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>First, if you fall into a harmonious pace with me, then I am going to
throw you into a bigger harmony,</p><p><br></p><p>the biggest, so that you can move with the stars, with the trees,
with the rivers, with the oceans. Then only will you know what it is to
be blessed.</p><p>I feel sorry for southern Africa, but what can I do? They will not
listen to me. Even you are hearing me and not listening to me. And I am
a very pragmatic, existential man. I am not a Don Quixote. But if I can
transform the vision of millions of white people, there is a possibility
that those millions of people will create enough energy, enough power to
transform even those who are so backward.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot go anywhere – no country will allow me in. Secondly, I
cannot go anywhere because America will not allow me back in. They are
holding my green card and hoping that somehow, someday I may go out of
the country for some reason. Then they won’t allow me any entry
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Boys, forget all that. Green card or no green card, I am going to be
here, because I know where I can have people who understand me. They
will carry the fragrance.</p><p>I have come to a new arrangement. I cannot go, but I have communes in
Europe, in Japan, in Australia. I am starting a new program: we will be
exchanging sannyasins for three months from one commune to another
commune. Thirty sannyasins from Germany will be coming here; thirty
sannyasins from here will be going to Germany. These thirty people going
from here will take my fragrance there, and those thirty people living
for three months here will catch fire!</p><p>Politicians think they are very intelligent – I can manage without
going anywhere. From all over the world now, there will be exchange
programs. Sannyasins who are now in tune with me will be going there. In
fact, I am going there within those thirty sannyasins! And the thirty
that will be coming here, I will enter in their hearts too. And this
exchange program from commune to commune around the world will create,
in fact, one single commune around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>We will be the first to dissolve the idea of boundaries. In Germany,
or in Holland, or in England, or in Italy – anywhere – they will feel
part of Rajneeshpuram, and they will not miss me at all. But about
Africa, we will have to wait a little.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES? SOME OF GURDJIEFF’S
DISCIPLES QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THINGS HE HAD SAID THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD
AS LIES. HE REPLIED THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE THE TRUTH COULD BE UNDERSTOOD
ONLY IN TERMS OF A LIE. IS THAT THE TRUTH?</p><p><br></p><p>Absolutely true.</p><p><br></p><p>Who can know it better than me?</p><p><br></p><p>There are problems in expressing truth. First, when you experience
it, there is no word, there is no language. The mind is put aside. You
experience it in such a profound silence that to give it in the form of
words to others already makes it a lie. And a great master knows which
lies can bring you nearer to him.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot understand truth, that is certain, because truth is not
something to be understood; it has to be experienced. The master’s work
is not to make you understand what is true. His work is to create a
situation in which you can see the truth.</p><p>And if he speaks the truth right now, you will not be able to bear
the shock of it. So he has to go very slowly. He will lie, because you
can understand only lies. Unconscious people, blind people – they have
lived on lies for centuries, they can understand a lie. But the master’s
lie is a strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>When I commented on Jesus before, in five volumes of books, I was
lying. Jesus has not the meaning that I was putting into his words. But
to bring Christians closer, that was the only way. I was speaking on
Buddha, on Mahavira, on Krishna, because that was the only way.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth cannot be said in the first place; and if you try, people will
simply escape from you. You have to think about the people first, what
is possible for them to absorb. And then slowly slowly they can absorb
more and more. A time comes when you can start turning their vision
towards the truth.</p><p>It is a great and arduous job to take away your diseases from you;
you are clinging to them. I have to gain your confidence first. You are
a Christian or a Hindu or a Jew, you are clinging hard to your religion
– and I want you to drop it. The only possible way is to tell you that
whatsoever you are carrying is not crap, it is Christianity, it is
great! That helps you to come closer to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment I see you have come so close and so far, and the return is
not possible, then I start hitting you. And then you will not feel hurt,
you will rejoice that I have taken so much trouble in lying to you.
That’s the way you catch men in your net. Once you are caught by me,
once I see the certainty in your eyes that whatsoever happens you are
going to be with me, when I have made absolutely certain that if you
have to leave Jesus for me you will; that if it is a question of Krishna
and me, and you have to choose, there is no uncertainty, you are going
to choose me.…</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff is right. He had a tremendously clear insight into the
human mind. Perhaps in this century he was the most significant figure.
And when he says, “The master has to use lies to bring you to the
truth,” he is absolutely right, because that’s what I have been doing my
whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always a risky game. First talking to you about Jesus, his
enlightenment – and he was not enlightened. First giving beautiful
meanings to his words – which he was incapable of giving to those words.
Once you become certain that I am in tune with Jesus, you have fallen in
the trap.</p><p>I don’t care about Jesus, Buddha or Mohammed. I care about you! And I
will do everything that can make you alert, aware, conscious of the
reality within you and without you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE WORDS “NEGATIVE” AND “NEGATIVITY” ARE OFTEN USED IN THIS COMMUNE.
WHAT DO THEY REALLY MEAN? THEY SEEM TO REFER TO ANY DOUBT OR QUESTION
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMUNE.</p><p><br></p><p>No, they don’t mean what you are thinking. They don’t mean that any
questioning, any doubt, is negativity. I am teaching you doubting,
questioning. How can my commune call you negative? Negative, negativity
have a totally different meaning.</p><p>There are people who can only see the dark side; they are addicted to
seeing the dark side. These addicted people are negative people. It is
impossible for them to see the lighted side of anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt, question, but don’t become a negative being. A negative being
cannot see anything right. A negative person cannot see anything
beautiful; everything is dark, ugly, hopeless. A negative person is
always in despair. Doubt is not despair, it is enquiry. Questioning is
man’s birthright. Question as much as you can. Doubt, and don’t repress
it, bring it forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt and questioning are positive qualities. You are saying, “I want
to understand more clearly before I move, hence the question. The
question is not against the commune, the question is for the commune, so
that I can do better. If I go on keeping this doubt in me, I cannot
commune with other people totally. Let me be freed from this doubt, this
question.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why do I go on answering you? For what? Just so that your questions
drop, they don’t become a barrier; your doubts drop, they don’t become a
barrier, and you are light, you can fly... because doubts and enquiries
repressed make you heavy. When all doubts are dispersed and all
questions are answered, you start growing wings; you can fly, you are
light.</p><p>But a negative person is a totally different phenomenon. He is
determined to remain negative. He is determined to see only the black
side. They say, “Every black cloud has a silver lining.” The negative
person will say, “Every silver lining is surrounded by a black
cloud.”</p><p>I am reminded of a beautiful story. In a monastery, two monks were
walking in the garden, and they both were in the same trouble. They were
allowed to smoke outside the monastery, but they were not allowed to
smoke inside the monastery. Most of the time they were inside the
monastery, and they were chainsmokers; it was really a torture.</p><p><br></p><p>They enquired, “Why are we not allowed to smoke in the
monastery?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the answer came from the abbot, “The monastery is a place of
prayer. You cannot be allowed</p><p>anything that spoils the pure, divine atmosphere in the monastery. It
is not a movie hall.”</p><p>But just this much was not going to help; they were addicted to their
smoking. They said, “We should</p><p>try one time more – separately, not in the congregation.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next day one monk was sitting in the garden joyously smoking. The
other monk came and was</p><p>very angry, he could not believe it. He said, “What are you doing?
Have you asked the abbot?” He said, “Yes, and he allowed me.”</p><p>The other said, “This is simply injustice. I also asked him, and he
said no!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man who was smoking smiled and he said, “I know why he said no to
you and yes to me. I approached with positivity, you approached with
negativity. Your negativity became a’no’ in the</p><p><br></p><p>heart of the abbot. My positivity became a’yes’ in the heart of the
same abbot. Please tell me what you asked, and things will be
clear.”</p><p>The man who was angry said, “I asked, ‘Can I smoke while praying?’
And the abbot said, ’No!</p><p>Absolutely no.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The one who was smoking said, “I also asked him. I asked him, ‘Can I
pray while I am smoking?’ And he said, ‘Yes! Absolutely yes!’”</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>15</span></p><p><br></p><p>All promise for tomorrow are lies</p><p><br></p><p>13 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT DISTURBS ME WHEN YOU DON’T SEEM TO BOTHER ABOUT FACTS.</p><p><br></p><p>You must be crazy! Why should it disturb you if it does not disturb
me? It is true I have no respect for facts, for the simple reason that
the fact is not the truth. The fact is our opinion about the truth. And
what opinion can you have? – unconscious, blind, conditioned by
centuries of rubbish. Why should I pay any respect to all this
nonsense?</p><p><br></p><p>Something was a fact yesterday, today it is not. It was a fact for
Jesus, Moses, Abraham, that the sun goes around the earth. It is no
longer a fact, it is just the opposite: the earth goes around the sun.
So why should you be disturbed? As man progresses and becomes more
intelligent, has more scientific methods to probe into reality, facts go
on changing every day.</p><p><br></p><p>I have immense respect for truth, because truth is not man’s opinion.
Truth is a revelation. You are</p><p>not, when the truth is there.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot make an opinion about the truth. You can experience it,
you can taste it, you can be it, but you cannot have an opinion about
it, because the moment truth faces you, you are no more. The ego that
used to make opinions simply disappears, just as when you bring light
into a dark room the darkness disappears. In fact it was never there it
was only the absence of light. The moment the light is present, how can
the light and the darkness exist together?</p><p><br></p><p>And your opinion is simply a barrier in finding the truth. You
somehow have got the idea that fact and truth are synonymous; they are
not. Sometimes the fiction is more true than the fact. Just look at the
three hundred years’ growth of science. Everything has changed.
Aristotle’s logic was a great discovery, accepted by all for almost
thousand years. Now it is just garbage. Non-Aristotelian logic has taken
its place; someday it will also be in the garbage.</p><p>Man’s truth – what he calls fact – has no validity. It is the blind
man’s idea of light. Why should I have any respect for it? And the most
amazing part is: why are you disturbed? The psychology of it is very
clear. When I don’t pay any respect to the so-called facts, your
knowledgeable mind gets disturbed. You want me to be infallible, you
want me to be the greatest master in the world. Not that you are
interested in me, your interest is in being the disciple of the greatest
master in the world. Your desire is to belong to a master who is always
respectful of facts.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, in many different contexts this will happen to you. I have
said again and again, I am a fallible, ordinary man. And to be a
disciple of a fallible, ordinary man is disturbing. But that simply
shows your ego and its longing. You would like to make me a God, because
then you become also God’s disciple. Then there is a direct
communication line between God and you.</p><p><br></p><p>Forgive me, I am not God, and there is no one who is, no one who has
ever been. It is your psychology that has created the prophets, the
messiahs, the avataras. They fulfilled your desire. And naturally, it
was good business: they became messiahs, and you became the special
apostles of the messiah. Unless man drops this stupid psychology, it is
very difficult to get rid of messiahs, prophets, great masters, because
you are so insistent on being a great disciple. How can you be a great
disciple if the master is fallible?</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying in every way to destroy your psychology, which has
dominated humanity for centuries. It has made you almost unintelligent,
but the balloon of your ego goes on becoming bigger and bigger. You,
your individuality, your consciousness, go on diminishing in the same
proportion.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you want? Should I say things which satisfy you? Or should I
say things as they are, whether they satisfy you or hurt you? It is your
responsibility, it is not my concern. Listening to your question, I
said, “Aha! Back to zero again!” Are you ever going to grow or not?</p><p>The geometric philosophy of Euclid dominated for centuries; no one
ever objected. Just within a hundred years the whole Euclidean geometry
has become a fiction; a non-Euclidean geometry has taken its place. I
say to you, the non-Euclidean geometry is also a fiction. It is not
going to remain there forever as a fact. Nothing that man creates out of
his sleep can become the eternal truth. To know the eternal truth, man
has to disappear completely. He is the hindrance.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to continue hammering your psychological slavery. I am not
concerned about facts, I am concerned with your freedom. You have to be
freed from all that is not your experience. And remember, your
experience is not yours, it is only experiencing. I have immense respect
for experiencing. The facts, at the most, may be useful in the ordinary
world of objects, but they have no basis in reality.</p><p>Experiencing may not be of any use in the outside world – perhaps it
may create trouble for you, but flowers will start showering on you,
your being will be contented. You will feel an absolute certainty that
you have come home.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>LATELY I HAVE NOT FELT BLISSFUL, BUT HAVE BEEN HAVING MANY DOUBTS AND
QUESTIONS. AM I MISSING THE POINT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?</p><p>Yes, you were missing the point when you were feeling blissful. Now
you are getting it! All that blissfulness was just bullshit; you
projected it. Now you are disturbed: that blissfulness has disappeared
and doubts, enquiries, questions are arising. And I say, this is what
should happen to everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>If your blissfulness was existential, true, then there would have
been no way for doubts to arise. It was a hallucination. You were on a
honeymoon trip, and now the honeymoon is finished. You are back home
unpacking the same suitcases which just seven days before you were
packing with such great joy. And now, look in the mirror and see your
face again. What happened to that bliss? What happened to that
expectation? What happened to your sweet dreams?</p><p><br></p><p>A dream is a dream, whether it is sweet or bitter, and sooner or
later you have to drop it; you cannot carry it forever. Only truth can
remain with you forever. That’s why I say feel blessed, not blissful,
that for the first time your intelligence has started functioning, that
some kind of awakening is happening, that the morning is very close by.
Those questions, enquiries, doubts, are of immense value; your
blissfulness was not worth a penny. I say so because these doubts, these
enquiries, these questions, are the beginning of the pilgrimage to
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against drugs for this reason – because the drugs can give you a
false blissfulness, and can stop you questioning, enquiring, doubting.
Even a man like Aldous Huxley fell into the same ditch. When he took LSD
he thought, “This is what Buddha was experiencing, Kabir was
experiencing, and all the great masters of the world were experiencing.”
He thought, “We have found, for the first time, the shortcut to
paradise.” But within hours the effect of the LSD disappears, and you
are back again, the same man, the same miserable creature. LSD has not
transformed you.</p><p>Any hallucination – either created by drugs, or created by
programming your mind, or created by your hidden desires of being great
– is a hindrance to realizing the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat: now you are in the right state of mind. It is painful,
bitter, but this is the nature of existence. Truth in the beginning is
bitter, in the end, tremendously sweet – and sweet forever. The untruth
is very sweet in the beginning, but ultimately leads you into hellfire.
And then it is too late to come back to your original state and start
again. Very few people have that courage.</p><p>Frederick Nietzsche, although a madman, had many beautiful flashes of
light, love, truth. He says man passes through three stages of
consciousness. The first stage he calls the camel, the second stage the
lion, and the third stage – the ultimate – the child. He has chosen
strange names for these stages.</p><p>You are all camels, the ugliest animal on the earth! – nothing is
straight. Have you ever ridden on a camel? Then you will know. I have
suffered much, because in India in the desert of Rajasthan, the</p><p><br></p><p>camel is the only way to go from one place to another. Sitting on a
camel for a few hours, one starts believing that hell is real.</p><p>The second stage Nietzsche calls the lion... a strange coincidence,
because Buddha used to call his words “the lion’s roar.” The lion is one
of the most beautiful animals on the earth; strong, and capable of being
alone. The lion doesn’t live like a sheep, in crowds. He lives alone,
without fear. He is ready to take any risk.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to become a lion to be alone. That does not mean that you
have to leave your family, your friends, your society, your commune –
no. You can be alone in the crowd, there is no problem. In fact, you are
alone. The crowd may be big – you can forget your aloneness in the
crowd, but forgetting makes no difference. Here, you are thousands of
sannyasins Just become a little alert,</p><p>and you will find you are alone. I am talking to each of you
separately. Nobody can talk to a crowd.</p><p>And the third stage Nietzsche calls the child. He has chosen a
beautiful name for the third stage – the newborn baby, fresh, no ego, no
desire to be somebody special in the world, no programmed mind, no
conditioning. He is neither Christian nor American, neither Hindu nor
Indian; he is simply himself. And there is utter silence in his being.
He has not yet read all kinds of things – which are useless, but they
clutter your mind; a moment comes when you are just a junkyard. The
child’s consciousness is just a mirror. It reflects whatsoever comes in
front of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The child does not know names. Do you think if you bring a red
roseflower before the child he will be thinking in his mind, “This is a
red rose, a very beautiful flower”? No, he will be seeing the flower, as
you never have. The fragrance will be reaching him as it cannot reach
you because there are so many barriers. He does not know the name of the
color, of the flower. He does not know that it is beautiful. As far as
his mind is concerned, it is silent, but he experiences the flower in
its totality. Words are not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>A rose is a rose is a rose.</p><p><br></p><p>Names and labels are not needed. What is needed is clarity,
innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>The third stage, the ultimate stage , Nietzsche calls the child. And
that’s what I am trying to do: to make you a child again – fresh,
uncluttered, with no ideology, so that you can encounter existence
directly. But if you want to experience it directly, you will have to
cut out all that prevents you from experiencing directly. Doubt is a
great instrument, questioning is of tremendous help, because without
them there is no enquiry.</p><p>Remember that doubt, enquiry, questions, are not negative. They are a
search for the positive. They become negative only when you get stuck
with them, when you make your doubt your belief – then they are
negative. When your enquiry becomes an addiction, and you forget
completely what you are enquiring for, then you are in bad shape.
Otherwise, it is a blessing that your hallucinations are over.</p><p><br></p><p>What has actually been happening with my people in these thirty
years? I have been in contact with thousands. I was speaking on Mahavira
– only the followers of Mahavira felt blissful. I was</p><p><br></p><p>speaking on Jesus – Christians felt blissful, because they thought I
was supporting their ego, their programmed mind, their Christianity,
their Jesus. So this has been happening again and again. First, to gain
your confidence, I say beautiful things about Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha.
The moment I see that now it is time – you cannot go back, you have come
too close to me – then I start speaking the truth.</p><p>It hurts, but this hurting is healthy. It hurts because it uncovers
your wound. A covered wound you may forget, but it is there and growing,
and may become a cancer. Open it to the air, to the sun, to the moon, to
existence. The whole existence is a healing force. If it can give you
life, can’t it heal small wounds created by your parents, your teachers,
your politicians? It is a very small job for existence. You just have to
open your wounds. And in the beginning it will hurt.</p><p>You are asking me, “Am I missing the point?” No, sir! This is the
point, you are getting it. Now it is up to you: you can escape and hide
again in your illusory blissfulness, or you can give a lion’s roar and
take the quantum leap into reality, knowing perfectly well it is going
to hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not the end. It hurts only because of your clinging to
your past blissfulness. Once your past blissfulness is dropped,
understood as a dream, the hurting disappears, the despair disappears.
On the contrary, for the first time you have risen as a man; you are no
longer an animal. For the first time the night is over and the sun has
risen. And you have learned a great secret.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on using that secret, and the third state of consciousness is not
far away. It is within your reach.</p><p>The lion’s roar breaks you away from your past, and joins you with
your future.</p><p><br></p><p>To become a child again is the greatest joy, and the greatest
achievement, because it gives you innocence, freedom, clarity to see
things as they are.</p><p>I am reminded of a story I have loved always. A great king conquered
almost all the known world of his time, and then there was frustration –
what to do next? He had everything, and he was stuck. The old habit, the
old greed of gaining more and more, – and now he found suddenly that now
there was no more. His whole life’s training was for more and more and
more, and now he had everything, there was nothing more.</p><p><br></p><p>He was very sad. His wives, his advisors, all tried to cheer him up,
but he said, “It is futile. Unless I have something more to conquer,
what is the point of living any longer?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then a very cunning priest – in fact, I should not say both the words
together, because the priest means the cunning – appeared in the court.
And he said, “Don’t be worried, I have heard about your anguish – there
is still much more. For example,” he said, “I can bring you divine
clothes from God, which have never come to the earth. You will be the
first man, and perhaps the last to have them.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was silence, there was doubt. But the king said, “What can he
do?” He asked, “What is going to</p><p>be the cost?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “Then forget all about it. One who asks the cost is
not worthy of receiving them. They</p><p>are priceless. But just to satisfy your enquiry I will say that a few
billion dollars will be needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “There is one condition. You will remain in one of my
palaces, guarded inside, and do whatsoever ritual, prayer you want to
do. And the moment you bring the clothes here, the money will be
delivered.”</p><p>The man said, “There is no problem; as far as I am concerned it is
perfectly good. But I will have to deliver the money when I get those
clothes from God – and I am a poor priest, you have to give me money
now. And I will remain in your palace. Keep all the doors closed, keep
the palace fully surrounded by your military, so that you can feel
comfortable. And the moment I bring the clothes, I will knock on the
door; then the guards have to take me to the place where you live.”</p><p><br></p><p>After three days he knocked on the door. Nobody believed it,
everybody was thinking that he seemed to be either very cunning or just
insane. Who has ever heard of the clothes of God coming to the earth?
But they all waited. The king could not even sleep, he was so thrilled.
He was again blissful: a new horizon to be achieved, a new dimension
opening – and for the first time! These moments were historic.</p><p>After three days the man came with a beautiful box to the court of
the king. He put the box down and said to the king, “God was very
pleased, because you are the bravest man ever. He has sent the divine
clothes. Just two things have to be remembered. One, the clothes are
invisible, just like God. Secondly, you have to take your clothes off.
Give me your cap and I will give you the divine cap; put it on your
head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just as I was coming I said to God, ‘This is a little hard, that the
clothes will be invisible.’ God said, ‘I will make one exception: the
man who is truly born out of his own father – one who is not a bastard –
will be able to see them.’ This is a special concession.”</p><p>The box was opened. The king looked into it: it was empty – of
course, the clothes were invisible. His intimates in the court looked
into the box, and they all started cheering and clapping, and they said,
“What beauty!”</p><p><br></p><p>The king thought, “Strange! Now if I say that the box is empty I will
be condemned by my own people. They will say that I am not the son of my
father, that my mother was flirting with somebody else. It is better to
keep quiet and save my prestige.” He also said, “Great! You have done
something impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the people in the court saw that the box was empty, but the same
question was in their minds: “All the others are seeing them, only I am
not; something is wrong with me. It is better to keep silent – not only
silent, but to praise the clothes more than the others, to prove that I
am the son of my own father.”</p><p><br></p><p>If things had stopped there, the king would have been happy. But the
man was really a priest. He took the clothes out one by one and gave
those invisible clothes to the king to wear, and he acted as if he was
putting a new robe on him. At the end it became difficult, because he
asked about the underwear.</p><p>The king hesitated. He knew that there was nothing, that he was
standing almost naked, only the</p><p>underwear was left. But now it was too late. If he said, “You cheat!
You have taken so much money,”</p><p><br></p><p>that wouldn’t be right because the whole court was dancing with joy:
“You look so beautiful, just like God!”</p><p>The poor king had to part with his underwear too. Now he was standing
completely naked. And the priest said, “Because the clothes from
paradise have come for the first time on the earth, the whole capital is
standing outside the palace; they want to see their king in divine
clothes.”</p><p>Again the king thought, “What to do? If I say no, it is too late.” He
had to say yes. On a beautiful chariot the naked king was standing, and
the crowd lined the road on both sides – millions of people shouting,
dancing, clapping, saying to each other, “This is the greatest moment in
our lives! We have not seen God, but we have seen his clothes. This is
not a small thing.” And they were all seeing that the king was standing
naked, but they had heard the condition – that only those who are born
out of their own fathers will be able to see the clothes.</p><p>So everybody was seeing them, except a little child who had come with
his father. Sitting on his</p><p>father’s shoulder, he said, “Daddy, the king is naked!”</p><p>The father simply said, “Shut up, you idiot! When you become my age
you will not see the king naked. You don’t understand anything. And if
you say it again, I will beat you! Keep your mouth closed.”</p><p>But the child said, “It is strange! Everybody is seeing the clothes
except me.” Only the child was seeing the truth, and the crowd was
pretending to see. And if you pretend anything long enough, it starts
becoming a fact to you, you start believing in it. But it is poisoning
your whole potentiality.</p><p>Forget all those blissful moments that you had felt before here. Now
I am in a hurry, and I am going to open all your wounds. So only those
who have the courage of a lion will remain my sannyasins. The camels
have already left for Santa Fe!</p><p>And if you are courageous enough, like a lion, your beautiful
childhood innocence is not far away. It is yours just to take. Be
thankful to your doubts, your enquiries, your questions. They will lead
you to the truth.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR MEN AND WOMEN TO BE FRIENDS? IT SEEMS SO
ORDINARY, AND TURNS OUT TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. EITHER THERE IS AN UGLY
COMPROMISE – LIKE MAN AND WIFE – OR ELSE PASSION THAT EVENTUALLY TURNS
INTO HATE. WHY IS THERE ALWAYS UGLINESS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN?</p><p>It is very simple to understand. Marriage is the ugliest institution
invented by man. It is not natural; it has been invented so that you can
monopolize a woman. You have been treating women as if they were a piece
of land, or some currency notes. You have reduced the woman to a
thing.</p><p>Remember that if you reduce any human being to a thing – unaware,
unconscious – you are also being reduced to the same status; otherwise,
you will not be able to communicate. If you can talk with a chair, you
must be a chair.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage is against nature.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be certain only of this moment that is in your hands. All
promises for tomorrow are lies – and marriage is a promise for your
whole life, that you will remain together, that you will love each
other, that you will respect each other till your last breath.</p><p><br></p><p>And these priests, who are the inventors of many ugly things, say to
you that marriages are made in heaven. Nothing is made in heaven; there
is no heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>If you listen to nature, your problems, your questions will simply
evaporate. The problem is: biologically man is attracted to woman, women
are attracted to men, but that attraction cannot remain the same
forever. You are attracted to something which is a challenge to get. You
see a beautiful man, a beautiful woman; you are attracted. Nothing is
wrong in it. You feel your heart beating faster. You would like to be
with this woman or man, and the attraction is so tremendous that in that
moment you think you would like to live with this woman forever.</p><p><br></p><p>Lovers don’t deceive each other, they are saying the truth – but that
truth belongs to the moment. When lovers say to each other, “I cannot
live without you,” it is not that he is deceiving or she is deceiving,
they mean it. But they don’t know the nature of life. Tomorrow this same
woman will not look so beautiful. As days pass, the man and the woman
both will feel that they are imprisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>They have know each other’s geography</p><p><br></p><p>completely. First it was an unknown territory to be discovered, now
there is nothing to be discovered. And to go on repeating the same words
and the same acts looks mechanical, ugly. That’s why passion turns into
hate. The woman hates you, because you are going to do the same thing
again. To prevent you, the moment the husband enters the house she goes
to bed, she has a headache. She wants somehow not to get into the same
rut. And the man is flirting with his secretary in the office; now she
is an unknown territory.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, it is all nature. What is unnatural is binding people in the
name of religion, in the name of God, for their whole life.</p><p>In a better, more intelligent world, people will love, but will not
make any contracts. It is not a business! They will understand each
other, and they will understand the changing flux of life. They will be
true to each other. The moment the man feels that now his beloved holds
no joy for him, he will say that the time has come to part. There is no
need for marriage, there is no need for divorce. Then friendship will be
possible.</p><p>You ask me why friendship is not possible between men and women.…
Friendship is not possible between the jailer and the imprisoned.
Friendship is possible between equal human beings, totally free from all
bondage of society, culture, civilization, only living true to their
authentic nature.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not an insult to the woman to say, “Honey, the honeymoon is
over.” It is not an insult to the man if the woman says, “Now things
cannot be beautiful. The wind that has blown is no longer there. The
season has changed, it is no longer spring between us; no flowers
blossom, no fragrance arises. It is time to part.” And because there is
no legal bondage of marriage, there is no question of any divorce.</p><p><br></p><p>It is ugly that the court and the law and the state interfere in your
private life – you have to ask their permission. Who are they? It is a
question between two individuals, their private affair.</p><p>There will be only friends – no husbands, no wives. Of course, if
there is only friendship, passion will never turn into hate. The moment
you feel passion disappearing, you will say good-bye, and it will be
understood. Even if it hurts, nothing can be done about it – it is the
way of life.</p><p><br></p><p>But man has created societies, cultures, civilizations, rules,
regulations, and made the whole humanity unnatural. That’s why men and
women cannot be friends. And men and women either become husbands and
wives – which is something absolutely ugly; they start owning each
other.…</p><p>People are not things, you cannot have ownership. If I feel your wife
is beautiful, and approach her, you are angry, you are ready to fight
because I am approaching your property. No wife is anybody’s property,
no husband is anybody’s property. What kind of world have you created?
People are reduced to properties; then there is jealousy, hatred.</p><p><br></p><p>You yourself know that you are attracted to the neighbor’s wife;
naturally, you can guess about your wife too. Your wife knows perfectly
well she is attracted to somebody else, but she cannot approach that
person because of the husband: he is standing there with a gun! Love is
bound to turn into hate, and for the whole life the hate goes on
accumulating. And out of this hatred do you think beautiful children are
going to be born? They are not born out of love, but out of duty. It is
the wife’s duty to allow you to use her.</p><p><br></p><p>To tell the truth, there is no difference between wives and
prostitutes. The difference is just like the difference between having
your own car or going in a taxi.</p><p>You go to a prostitute – it is for a few hours, it is beautiful.
After a few hours it is finished; you have paid the woman. And now there
are male prostitutes also, particularly in California; California seems
to be not part of this world. A few hours of relationship is purchased,
and when you pay the woman or the man, everything is goody-goody. You
will not recognize each other the next day when you meet on the street;
there is no need, there has been no contract. You will not even say
hello, not even “Hi.” There is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>A prostitute is purchased only for a few hours; wives are a long-term
affair, it is economical. Royal families are not allowed to marry
outside royal blood: status, money, power.… Nobody can love anybody in
such circumstances, where the relationship is financial.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman is dependent on you because you earn. And for centuries men
have not allowed women to be educated, to be in business, to have jobs,
for the simple reason that if the woman has her own financial status,
her own bank account, you cannot reduce her to a thing. She has to be
dependent on you. And do you think anybody who has to be dependent on
you will love you?</p><p><br></p><p>Every woman wants to kill the husband. It is another matter that she
does not kill him – because if she kills him, what will she do? She is
not educated, she has no experience of the society, she has no way of
earning. The husband – every husband, I don’t make any exceptions –
wants to get rid of the woman. But he cannot get rid of her. There are
children, and he himself has promised the woman thousands of times that
he loves her. When he goes to his job he kisses the woman; there is no
love in it, just skeletons touching each other. Nobody is present.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has created a society in which friendship between man and woman
is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like my people to remember – even though you have to follow
the laws of the society; otherwise they will imprison you and punish you
and kill you... but remember, friendship is so valuable that whatsoever
the consequence, remain friends even with your wife, even with your
husband, and allow absolute and total freedom to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see any problem. If I love a woman, and one day she says that
she has fallen in love with somebody else and feels very happy, I will
be happy. I love her, and I would like her to be happy – where is the
problem? I will help her in every way so that she can be more happy. If
she can be more happy with somebody else, what hurts me?</p><p><br></p><p>It is your ego that hurts: she has found somebody else who is better
than you. It is not a question of better, it may be just your chauffeur
– it is just a question of a little change. And if you give full freedom
to each other, perhaps you can remain together for your whole life, or
for the whole eternity, because there is no need to get rid of each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage creates the need to get rid of each other, because it means
freedom is taken away – and freedom is the highest value in human life.
Make all the couples free, and you will be surprised, this very world
becomes paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other problems. You have children – what to do with
children? My answer is that children should not belong to their parents,
they should belong to the commune. Then there is no problem. The parents
can meet the children, they can invite the children, they can be friends
with their children; and yet the children are not dependent on them,
they belong to the commune. And it will destroy many psychological
problems.</p><p>If a boy knows only his mother, the mother’s personality becomes an
imprint on him. Now, his whole life he will be trying to find a woman
who is like his mother – and he will never find such a woman. A girl
will never find another man who is exactly a copy of her father. Then
you cannot be satisfied with any woman, any man.</p><p><br></p><p>But if the children belong to the commune, they will come in contact
with so many uncles and so many aunts – they will not carry a single
picture in their minds. They will have a vague idea of womanhood or
manhood, and to that idea, many people of the commune will have
contributed; it will be multidimensional. There is a possibility of
finding somebody, because you only have a vague idea. You can find
somebody, and that person will make your vague idea solid, a reality.
Right now you have a solid idea within you, and you meet a vague person.
Sooner or later there is disappointment.</p><p><br></p><p>And children belonging to the commune will learn much, will be more
friendly, will be more available to all kinds of influences. They will
be richer. A child being brought up by a couple is very poor. He does
not know that there are millions of people with different minds,
different kinds of beauty. If a child moves in the commune, naturally he
will be far richer. And he will have known so much before he decides to
be with someone that there is a possibility of a long friendship.</p><p>What happens now? You see a girl on the beach and you fall in love.
You know nothing about the girl, you know only her make-up. Tomorrow
morning when you get up and the make-up is gone, you</p><p><br></p><p>will say, “My God! What have I done? This is not the woman I married,
this is someone else!” But you cannot go against your word either. And
if you do, then the government is there, the courts are there to put you
back into your right place. This is a very ugly situation, sick.</p><p>People should be given freedom to know each other, to know as many
people as possible, because each person is so unique, there is no
question of comparison. Let the child drink from many sources, and he
will have some insight into who is going to be the right person to live
with.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody will fall in love; everybody will decide consciously that
“This is the one.” He has known so many people, he understands that this
is the one who has those characteristics, those qualities that he has
loved. And then too it is only going to be a friendship. There is no
fear; if tomorrow things change there is no harm.</p><p><br></p><p>The society should not live in a routine way, in a fixed way –
static, dormant – it should be a moving flux. One woman can give you a
certain kind of joy, another woman can give you another kind of joy. A
third woman will be a surprise. So why remain poor”? – just because
Jesus has said, “Blessed are the poor”?</p><p><br></p><p>Be richer in every dimension, and keep yourself open and available.
And whoever you are with, let the other person understand clearly that
“It is freedom between us, not a marriage license. Out of freedom we
meet, with no promises for the future – because who knows the
future?”</p><p><br></p><p>When I was a student in the university in my final master’s course,
one girl was very much interested in me. She was a beautiful girl, but
my interest was not in women at that time. I was crazy in search of
God!</p><p>After the examinations, when she was leaving the university She had
waited – I knew it – she had</p><p>waited and waited for me to approach her. That is the usual way, that
the man approaches the woman; it is graceful for the woman not to
approach the man. Strange idea... I don’t understand. Whoever
approaches, it is graceful. If fact, whoever initiates is
courageous.</p><p>When we were leaving the university she said, “Now there is no
chance.” She took me aside and said, “For two years continuously I have
been waiting. Can’t we be together for our whole lives? I love you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “If you love me, then please leave me alone. I also love you,
that’s why I am leaving you alone – because I know what has been
happening in the name of love. People are becoming imprisoned, chained;
they lose all their joy, life becomes a drag. So this is my parting
advice to you,” I said, “Never try to cling to a person for your whole
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>If two persons are willingly together today, it is more than enough.
If tomorrow again they feel like</p><p>being together, good. If they don’t, it is their personal affair;
nobody has to interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now, the problem of the children has always been raised. My
answer is that children should belong to the commune. They can go to
their parents, whether their parents are together or separate. And they
should learn from their parents that love is no slavery, it is freedom.
And they should move in the commune, tasting, enjoying different
qualities of different people.</p><p><br></p><p>So by the time they decide, their decision will be not just a foolish
type of “falling in love”; it will be a very considered, contemplated,
meditated phenomenon. There is a possibility they may remain together
for their whole lives. In fact, if there is freedom, there is more
possibility; more people will remain together.</p><p>If marriage disappears, divorce disappears automatically. This is a
by-product of marriage. Nobody takes note of the simple fact: why for
centuries have there been prostitutes? Who created them? Who is
responsible for these poor women? It is the institution of marriage.</p><p>You are bored with your wife; just for a change you go to a woman who
is not going to be a bondage – because one is enough, two will be too
much. It is just a temporary, few hours’ meeting. You can keep yourself
lovely for a few hours, loving for a few hours. She can keep herself
lovely and loving for a few hours. And moreover, she has been paid for
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Around the world millions of women are reduced to selling their
bodies. Who has done it? Your political leaders, your religious leaders.
I consider these people criminals. And not ordinary criminals, because
for centuries the whole humanity has been suffering because of these few
idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to start with yourself, there is no other way. If you
love somebody, then freedom should be the connecting link between you.
And if you see your woman tomorrow hugging somebody else, there is no
need to be jealous. She is being enriched, she is tasting a little
newness – just the way you go sometimes to a Chinese restaurant! It is
good. You will come back to your own food, but the Chinese restaurant
has helped you; you may relish your own food more.</p><p><br></p><p>But after a few days, again – that’s how the mind is – you are moving
towards an Italian restaurant... spaghetti. I cannot even tolerate
somebody eating spaghetti in front of me! But that is my problem</p><p>Life is so simple and so beautiful, just one thing is missing:
freedom. If your wife is being with some other people, soon she will
come back to you enriched, with new insight. And she will find something
in you she had never found before. And meanwhile, you need not just sit
down in your chair and beat your head. You also gain experience, so that
by the time your woman is back you are also new. You have also been to
the Chinese restaurant.</p><p>Life should be a joy, a rejoicing. And then only can there be
friendship between men and women; otherwise, they are going to remain
intimate enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s13>1 6</span></p><p><br></p><p>You have to grow inwards, that is your earth</p><p><br></p><p>14 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE GROWTH MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CALLED THE “NEW NARCISSISM” BY MANY, DUE
TO ITS EMPHASIS ON ASSERTIVENESS AND VALUING ONE’S OWN PERSONAL EGO. HOW
DOES YOUR WAY DIFFER?</p><p>There is no way. It is impossible to have a way, because you are
already there. You have never left home. This whole search for the way
is driving you crazy; you cannot find it because you are already there.
Wherever you go, you will go against your being, farther and farther
away. You have gone already too far.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time to drop the idea of the way. Life is not a becoming, not
some kind of process. It is being.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot ask me how my way differs from the growth movement,
because I have no way. I am not teaching you a way – really, I am taking
you away from all the ways.</p><p>But the question has some significance. The growth movement was
egoistic. It was the assertion of the ego repressed for centuries. Just
by being assertive and egoistic you don’t start growing. Or worse, you
start growing in a wrong way.</p><p><br></p><p>My movement is not egoistic. I am not here to make your ego more and
more strong – it is already</p><p>too strong. My movement is towards egolessness. That’s where I depart
from the growth movement.</p><p><br></p><p>And no one can grow by strengthening the ego. He will remain just an
imaginary being; he will not come to know his authentic reality.</p><p>The ego is not you, it is a pretender. People need it because they
don’t know who they are, and it is really difficult to live without
having some idea of who you are; hence the ego comes into existence. It
is a make-believe; it is constructed by you so that you don’t feel the
vacuum, so that somehow you can manage to drag yourself to your
grave.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to drop the ego and then see: you will be vast, there will
be no limit to you. That is growth. To become a tiny, pygmy ego is not
growth, it is just the opposite.</p><p>The growth movement should not be called a growth movement at all. It
is selling phony commodities to you; it is really cutting your very
roots. And if you become satisfied with the ego you will never search,
seek, for your self, because you will continue to believe, “This ego is
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan, for centuries it has been thought to be an art: great
gardeners have been cutting the roots of trees. The tree is placed in a
pot which has no bottom, so whenever the roots start growing, they just
have to take up the pot and cut the roots. There are
four-hundred-year-old trees only six inches high. I cannot conceive that
this is art – this is murder. And those poor trees cannot say anything.
If you don’t allow their roots to grow deeper into the earth, they will
not grow higher into the heavens, towards the stars. The deeper their
roots, the higher will be their growth.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about man. Nature functions in an absolutely
harmonious way. There are not many ways that nature grows. It may be a
tree, a bird, a man – it doesn’t matter, the principle, the law of
growth remains the same: Let your roots go deeper.</p><p>Of course, a tree is standing, does not move – it has no legs. There
are a few trees in Africa which, out of sheer necessity, have had to
move. The jungles in Africa are so thick, and the trees are so big that
there is no chance for new trees to grow; the sun never reaches them. It
is just a sheer question of life and death. And they start moving out of
crowded spaces to find some place where they can also have the sun, the
air, the moon, the earth. In Africa there are walking trees; they walk
in their own way, and are very intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>Forget the idea that man is the only intelligent being on the earth.
Yes, just as a tree is different from your body, it is different from
your intelligence. But it has its own kind of intelligence. It has been
found that the trees which move always in the direction where more water
is available, more sun is available, more air is available, more space
is available. How do they know which direction to move, which path to
take? And they never make any mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>They are not like Moses, who wandered for forty years with the poor
Jews dying in the desert, finding Israel, the holy land promised to him
by God himself. Forty years in the desert? Almost two-thirds of the Jews
died on the way before they reached the place. I certainly say that it
has nothing holy about it. But Moses was also tired and old. His people
were almost finished, and the remaining ones were getting angry with
him. They had lost all trust in him. He did not know where he was going.
And in a desert it is very difficult to find a path; there are no roads,
no paths.</p><p><br></p><p>But these trees are far more intelligent than Moses. They don’t
wander here and there, they simply rush exactly to the point where they
can survive, grow. In a few places where water pipelines are</p><p><br></p><p>close by, they don’t bother to go to a faraway place where they can
find a river or a pond. They are</p><p>very progressive, more progressive than Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p><br></p><p>They drop the idea of going to the river, which their parents have
always followed. They don’t care a bit about the past and the tradition;
they rush towards the pipeline. And they are strong enough to break
steel pipelines; they put their roots into the pipeline. Can you call
these trees unintelligent? They have a different kind of
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>But growth is possible only if you go deeper into your roots. You are
not a tree; hence, you are not to grow your roots into the earth – that
will be sheer death. You have to grow inwards. That is your earth. There
you have to spread your roots, because there is your nourishment: your
water, your sun, your air, your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have found the center of your consciousness, growth happens
of its own accord. It has not to be done, you have not to grow. It is
just as when the tree gets nourishment, it starts growing: fresh leaves
and flowers and branches suddenly start appearing.</p><p><br></p><p>The growth movement was not a growth movement. It started, of course,
in California. Any nonsense... if you find it, and you want to trace
where it started from, you have to go to California. It started in
Esalen.</p><p>One of the directors of Esalen came to me, because he had become fed
up. No growth was happening – and he was the director, so what about the
poor fellows he was directing? He became a sannyasin here in America,
and after one year he came to see me.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is one of my experiences: these people who become accustomed
to leading others, who become accustomed to the attitude that “I know,
and you do not; therefore, follow me”.…</p><p>This director was directing the whole show in Esalen for many years.
How many people he destroyed I don’t know, but he must have destroyed a
lot. Reading my books.… First his young daughter became my sannyasin,
because she was still unpolluted. She became my messenger in Esalen, she
turned many Esalen people to sannyas. It was she who insisted that her
father come to me, and he came.</p><p><br></p><p>To read my books, to listen to my tapes, is one thing. But to come to
me and look eye to eye – it is very difficult.</p><p>The man’s name was Dick, and he proved a dick! Just within a few days
he escaped without telling anybody. We looked for him – where had he
gone? From Esalen I received his letter saying, “Yours is too dangerous
a place.” He must have been thinking that growth is without risk, growth
is just a game, a gimmick. Perhaps you have to read something, do a few
stupid groups, and within a few weeks you are grown-up.</p><p>Growth is simple on the one hand – the simplest thing – and on the
other hand the most difficult thing, almost impossible. The reason why
it is so, is: it is simple if you have guts. It is so simple that
nothing has to be done, you just have to become a little more ingoing,
directed towards your inner reality. Just as you see things with open
eyes, you have to close your eyes and see what is there. It is so
simple.</p><p><br></p><p>It becomes dangerous because you have to lose many things. You have
to lose all your past, your knowledgeability, your so-called growth. You
have to lose everything that you have accumulated around you. It is all
junk! If you cling to it, growth becomes impossible.</p><p>That man ran away from me. He still reads my books, he still listens
to my tapes, but now I am so close, he has no courage to come back –
because there in Esalen he is the director, and here he has to be
nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Esalen is almost dead, it has seen its days of glory. People have
deserted it – only a few people once in a while go there – because they
could see the point: that in becoming egoistic they are creating a more
miserable life for themselves. What is the point of growing up? –
misery, agony, jealousy, competitiveness, violence... because if you are
assertive, violence is not very far away from you. It is just behind you
like a shadow; your assertiveness can become violence any moment. And
with a strong ego it is bound to become your very way of life.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not trying here to polish your egoistic mind. I am trying to
demolish, not polish. I am trying to help camels to become lions! Of
course, it is difficult for a camel to become a lion, but it is not
impossible, because I have made many camels into lions.</p><p>And once you become a lion, I have nothing to do. Your very lionhood
will make you a child: simple, innocent, clean, pure, holy. That is
growth. You have found the roots. And those roots are not just yours.
You cannot claim, “These are my roots,” because your ego is no longer
there to claim it. You have found the universal source of roots. You
know now, perfectly well, that it is the same existence that blossoms in
the rose, in the lotus, that moves the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same universe that is your energy too. You are not apart
from existence, you are part of it. And the moment you realize that you
are part of this beautiful universe, a great ecstasy surrounds you
twenty-four hours a day.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is not only a difference between the so-called growth
movement and what is happening here, they are diametrically opposite.
The so-called growth movement is preventing people from growing. It
consists only of camels. We are not interested in keeping you in the
lowest grade of consciousness – camels, ugly. Nothing is straight in a
camel; you cannot find a single straight line. Everything is as it
should not be.</p><p>The lion has a beauty, tremendous beauty. If you have seen any
statue, or a photograph or a drawing of the face of that great lion,
Bodhidharma, you will be surprised looking at his eyes. Those eyes look
so ferocious. The man was not like that, he was one of the most
beautiful men who has walked on the earth. It is symbolic: those are the
eyes of a lion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a well-known fact that when the lion kills some animal, his
method is hypnotism. He simply looks into the eyes of the animal, and
the animal becomes hypnotized, stuck, frozen. He cannot escape, he
cannot move. Trembling, he stands before the lion. The lion just has to
keep hold of his eyes; through the eyes he prevents him from escaping.
You will see in Bodhidharmas’s eyes the same flare, the same flame.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people escape from me. Their whole lives they will escape; now
this becomes their growth.</p><p>They waste their lives just escaping, and they can’t see a simple
fact, that they are just cowards.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an opportunity to go through a transformation. Of course
something has to be dropped, something has to be burned, something has
to be completely forgotten; only then do you allow transformation to
take place.</p><p>The master’s work is to transform camels into lions. Then things take
their own course: the lion becomes a child without any effort. The lion
has found the roots. The child is going to blossom into his being.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, the sannyasins have to drop everything – and dropping
everything you have saved yourself; otherwise you are going to be
drowned in all the mud that you have accumulated. Your parents, your
teachers, your priests, your culture, religion, society – they are all
pouring mud on you. And it is a very sticky mud, you become glued to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The decision to become a sannyasin is a very great, momentous
decision, because from that point you will have to leave everything that
you thought was yours, and you will have to move into a new dimension
where nothing belongs to you. On the contrary, you belong to the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see the difference? When you say, “This belongs to me,” this
is the language of the ego. And when you say, “I belong to the
universe,” this is the language of egolessness. Then you are in a total
let-go. If you belong to the universe, then it is the universe who is
going to take care of you.</p><p>I am saying it from my own experience. For thirty-two years I have
been the poorest richest man in the world. And I don’t have anything
that belongs to me, nothing belongs to me, but the phenomenon of
belonging to the universe has created harmony out of a great
contradiction. As far as belongings are concerned, I am the poorest man
you can find. Even a beggar has something which belongs to him.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to go to the university to teach. An old beggar was always
there. The railway station was just in between my house and the
university; the old beggar was always begging at the railway station,
and he knew when I would be passing. He would come to the road and stand
there. One day I was surprised – a young man was standing there, a young
beggar. I said, “What happened to the old man?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I got married to his daughter, and he has given me his
place as the dowry. This is the best place in our profession! The
railway station – so many new people coming and going – the university,
so many people coming and going... there is nothing comparable to
it.”</p><p>So I said, “What happened to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Now he has moved to another spot.” The city had two
stations, so he had moved to another station. And he was a very strong
fellow; he must have thrown out the beggar who was thinking that that
station belonged to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing belongs to anybody, but even beggars are richer than me.
Because I am not there, how can anything belong to me? And the moment I
disappeared, my consciousness became part of the whole. I lost
everything and I gained everything; hence I say, I am the poorest and
the richest man. In these thirty-two years I have lived like a king, and
I have not earned a single cent. The universe takes care. The universe
is benevolent.</p><p><br></p><p>You are this universe’s children. Just become a child, and your eyes
will be able to see the point. And from that moment, growth goes on
happening; you go on and on. And there are no borders to existence.
There are no borders to your growth either.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SAYING THAT THE WORDS OF THE MASTER BECOME MERE
WORDS AFTER THE MASTER IS GONE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER YOU ARE GONE?</p><p>Do you think my words are not already dead for you? First, think of
that. The master is there, his words are there, but are those words
alive for you? If they are alive for you, don’t be worried. You know the
secret.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not the words. The master can be there and the words can be
dead. So why can’t it happen the other way around? – the master is dead,
but the words are still alive. It all depends on you. It is not a
question of the master’s life or death, but how you relate to those
words.</p><p>Yes, it is simpler when the master is there, only in one way. Because
those words are spoken, they carry some flavor of the master’s heart.
They carry a few beats of the master’s heart towards you. It is simple
in this way. But on the other hand, when the master is alive, perhaps
the words will never become alive to you, because you start taking the
master for granted. Then the words are dead.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the second world war that Adolf Hitler declared that
he was going to destroy the Tower of London. Millions of people rushed
towards the tower – they had passed the tower thousands of times in
their lives, but had never taken the trouble to see it. People come from
all over the world to see the Tower of London, but Londoners take it for
granted. The moment Hitler said he was going to destroy it, suddenly
those people who had lived their whole lives in London became aware that
the Tower of London could not be taken for granted anymore. They rushed
to see it before this madman, Adolf Hitler, destroyed it.</p><p>The master is alive – but the disciple can take him for granted. You
can take me for granted. Then those words are already dead, because your
aliveness is not available. If you are capable of being alert, alive,
responsive, it makes no difference: the master may be dead, but his
words will go on resounding in you. Even the written words, which are
dead, can become alive in you; you just have to open your heart.</p><p>The question is not of the master’s life and death, the question
basically is of your response.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried about when I am gone. Those who are missing me
now will be missing me then too – no loss. Those who are living my
message now, they will go on living it. And if they go on living it,
they cannot help but spread it. I am not depending on books – all the
religions have depended on books – I am depending on you!</p><p>George Gurdjieff used to say – very sadly, of course – that if even
two hundred people are enlightened, they can make the whole world full
of light, full of life. Just two hundred people can transform the whole
character of humanity. He could not manage it, but what he said is
true.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to manage it! I will not leave you unless I have made
enough people enlightened so that they can make the whole world afire,
alive. I am depending on you, not on any books. Those books may be
helpful in some way to bring people to you, but my word will be
throbbing in your heart; only then can you help anybody who comes to
you.</p><p>And it is so simple. I have more than half a million sannyasins in
the world, and more than one million people who are just on the
borderline – a little push and they will be sannyasins. One million more
who are lovers but cannot drop their camelhood.…</p><p>On this big a scale, a worldwide scale, nobody has worked before.
Gautam Buddha remained confined to the small state of Bihar in India –
not even the whole of India. India has thirty states; Buddha remained
confined to one space, one state. He did great work, but it was
impossible to transform the whole quality of consciousness on the earth.
The same is true about Jesus, Moses – anybody who has been trying.</p><p><br></p><p>For a simple reason I have been able to contact millions of people
around the world: I am not confined to any tradition. I am not burdened
by the past, I am completely weightless. So anybody who is burdened –
and who is not burdened? – becomes interested in me, particularly the
young people who are fed up with all the nonsense that is being taught
in the churches and the synagogues, in the temples, in the mosques.</p><p>All these people, these churches, synagogues and mosques, are trying
to bridge the gap. You have heard the phrase “generation gap.” Between
you and the church, between you and the synagogue, there is not just a
generation gap, there is a gap of hundreds of generations. And in trying
to bridge it, they are proving themselves buffoons, because truth never
compromises. It cannot – with whom will it compromise? Compromising
truth means compromising with lies.</p><p><br></p><p>And all these people have become afraid that young people are no
longer interested; they don’t come to the synagogue, they don’t come to
the church, so something should be done that can attract young people.
Their whole business is going down.</p><p>I have heard about three rabbis.… And by the way, don’t let me drift.
Whenever I come across the word “rabbi” I immediately associate it with
rubbish. These three rabbis were meeting, discussing, talking about
great things. One rabbi said, “My synagogue is the most modern, because
we allow people to smoke in the synagogue. There is no harm in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The second rabbi said, “This is nothing, my synagogue is even more
modern: we even allow people</p><p>to make love in the synagogue. What is wrong with it?”</p><p><br></p><p>The third rabbi said, “This is nothing. My synagogue is the most
avant-garde.” The two rabbis said, “Just tell us what you have
done.”</p><p>He said, “My synagogue remains closed for Jewish holidays!”</p><p><br></p><p>They are trying hard, but it is just foolishness. They cannot catch
hold of the new spirit of man.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t give you any tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t give you any scripture.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t give you any discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>Those are all non-essentials. I simply concentrate my whole work on
making you more conscious. Consciousness is the key to transform the
whole of humanity.</p><p>And yes, Gurdjieff is right: if even two hundred people are aflame,
enlightened, the whole world will become enlightened, because these two
hundred torches can give fire to millions of people. Those people are
also carrying torches, but without any fire. They have everything, just
the fire is missing. And when fire passes from one torch to another, the
first torch is not losing anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened consciousness is an infinite reservoir: it can give
to you and yet it remains the same. Its quantity does not decrease,
because it is not a question of quantity at all; it is a question of
quality. Qualities can be shared without losing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>You can love as many people as you want – that does not mean one day
you will go bankrupt, and you will have to declare, “Now I have no
love.” You cannot go bankrupt as far as love is concerned. Yes, you can
go bankrupt as far as money is concerned. Money is a quantity; love is a
quality. What to say of enlightened consciousness? It is the highest
quality possible; there is nothing higher than that.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid, worried that if I am gone, then what will happen to
my words. I will not be gone before I have sown the seeds of those words
in you. They are not mine! They are nobody’s. They are coming out of
existence itself – I am simply a vehicle. You can become a vehicle.
Everybody is capable of becoming a vehicle. Hence, I am not depending on
old strategies; they have all failed. I am depending on living human
beings.</p><p>And that is the only way to save humanity without becoming a savior,
to save humanity without creating in them greed for heaven and fear of
hell. The only way to save humanity is to give them some taste of what
it means to be enlightened, a little fragrance, so they can feel the
invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am absolutely certain, utterly happy, that I have got the right
people: people who are going to be my books, my temples, my synagogues.
This is the reason I call this the first religion, because it depends on
living human beings, not on dead holy scriptures, traditions,
beliefs.</p><p><br></p><p>I am giving you the taste of my being, and preparing you to do the
same, on your part, to others. It all depends on you, whether my words
will remain living or will die. As far as I am concerned, I do not
care.</p><p>While I am here, I am pouring myself into you. And I am grateful that
you are allowing it to happen. Who bothers about the future? There is
nobody in me who can care about the future. If existence can find me as
a vehicle, I can remain assured that it can find thousands of people to
be its vehicle.</p><p><br></p><p>I am simply giving you a little opportunity to become vehicles of the
whole. Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I AM BRITISH, MISERABLE, UNENLIGHTENED, AND AN EX-SANNYASIN. IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE LEFT FOR ME TO ACHIEVE?</p><p>No, sir! You have done everything. You have done really more than is
possible. Now the only thing left for you is Krishnamurti Lake.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IF YOU DEPART ON THE 6TH OF JULY OF ANY YEAR, ARE WE ALL GOING WITH
YOU?</p><p>No, nobody is going with me. I am not Reverend Jim Jones, I am not
even a Christian. The day I go, your responsibility to live becomes
greater – to live me, to become me. All around the world all the
communes have to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to die with me. It is so easy that it is against my
sannyasins’ dignity. I will not give you such any easy job. You have to
live! And when I am not there, you have to live more consciously, more
carefully – because who is going to spread me all over the world?</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, dying is a very easy thing; it happens in a single moment.
Living is the real challenge. My leaving the body will be a challenge
for you, that now that I have left one body, I can be in all of your
bodies; that now I am not speaking from one mouth, I can speak from
millions of mouths.</p><p>Christians have been cowards, not accepting the responsibility of
Jonestown. They have created a religion which is death-oriented. My
religion is life-oriented, I do not believe in death. In fact, there is
no death. Nothing dies, it only transmigrates into new forms.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened person does not enter another life circle; he has
nothing left to learn. The world is just a school. If you go on
committing mistakes in unconsciousness, existence will give you millions
of chances to come back again and again until you get awakened and drop
your mistakes. That will be your last embodiment.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to be reborn in a body, because that would be just
idiotic. When I can live in the bodies of millions of my sannyasins,
what is the point of again getting caged in one body? In fact, the
enlightened consciousness simply spreads into all those who are
available and open. It becomes universal.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not going with me, but I am coming within you! Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SPEAK OF REINCARNATION. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT, AND I DON’T
WANT TO BELIEVE IN ANYTHING I DON’T EXPERIENCE. WHAT TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Who is asking you to believe in reincarnation? And why are you
concerned to do something about it? There must be some lingering belief.
If you don’t believe in reincarnation, that is the full stop. Why bother
about what to do?</p><p>Don’t believe in reincarnation! Just live this incarnation, and you
will come to experience that reincarnation is not theory, it is a
reality. Just live this incarnation. Do you believe in this incarnation,
or not? Reincarnation is either in the past or in the future, but you
are here, alive. Life is throbbing in you.</p><p><br></p><p>I know reincarnation is a truth. But I am not saying that you should
believe it because I say so. Never believe anybody else’s experience;
that is a hindrance. I can only say to you, just live this incarnation.
That will open doors and you will be able to see backwards, you will be
able to see forwards. And then it is up to you to believe in it or not.
How can you disbelieve it then? But before that Let it become an
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions are based on belief systems. I am giving you
absolute freedom to enquire, to doubt, because that is the only way to
experience on your own. And unless you experience on your own, there is
no value at all in believing.</p><p>You love me. Naturally, if I say reincarnation is a truth, out of
your love you may believe in me. Out of your love, how can you conceive
that I may be telling something untruthful to you? You trust me.</p><p><br></p><p>And this trust has been exploited for million of years, this love has
been exploited by every religion. I am not going to exploit in any way.
About whatsoever I have known I can open my heart to you, but remember
not to fall in the trap of believing. Love is good, trust is good – but
belief is poison. If you really love me, if you really trust me, then
make every effort to experience what I am saying to you. I want
enquirers, people who are capable of doubt, who are capable of asking
questions.</p><p>All the religions have repressed people’s questions, their doubts,
their enquiries. They say, “Don’t bring in all these things. We know.
For you, all that is left is to believe.” That’s why you see the whole
humanity in such a miserable, dark, dismal ignorance. The responsibility
goes to the religions.</p><p><br></p><p>Your love, I respect. For your trust, I am grateful. But these
beautiful things should not be used as a strategy to make you a
believer. I want you to be a knower. If you love me and trust me, then
go on enquiring, searching, seeking. Till you have found, never believe.
And I can say it with such certainty, because I know that if you enquire
you will find it; it is there!</p><p><br></p><p>The other religions have been telling you to believe, because they
are not certain that it is there. It is because of their own doubt that
they are repressing your doubts. They are afraid that if you start
doubting and asking and enquiring, you may not find any God, any
reincarnation, any truth. Then their whole business – and it is the
biggest business in the world – will simply disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned, not a single word from me has to be
believed, but to be experienced. And I am giving you the method, how to
experience it.</p><p>Become more meditative. Reincarnation and God, heaven and hell, do
not matter. What matters is your becoming alert. Meditation awakens you,
gives you eyes – and then whatever you see, you cannot deny.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned, reincarnation is a truth, because in
existence nothing dies. Even the physicist will say, about the objective
world, that nothing dies. You can destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki – so
much power science has given to chimpanzee politicians – but you cannot
destroy a single drop of water.</p><p>You cannot destroy. Physicists have become aware of this
impossibility. Whatever you do, only the form changes. You destroy a
single dewdrop, and there is hydrogen and oxygen; they were its
components. You cannot destroy hydrogen or oxygen. If you try, then from
molecules you come to atoms. If you destroy the atom, you come to
electrons. We don’t know right now if we can destroy the electron.
Either you cannot destroy it – it is the ultimate objective constituent
of reality – or if you can destroy it, then you will find something
else. But nothing can be destroyed in the objective world.</p><p>The same is true about the world of consciousness, of life. There is
no death. Death is only a change from one form into another form, and
ultimately from form to formlessness. And that is the goal – because
every form is a kind of imprisonment. Unless you become formless, you
cannot get rid of misery, jealousy, anger, hatred, greed, fear, because
these are concerned with your form.</p><p>But when you are formless, there is nothing that can harm you, there
is nothing that you can lose any more, there is nothing that can be
added to you. You have come to the ultimate realization.</p><p>Only Gautam Buddha has given the right word for this experience. In
English it is difficult to translate it, because languages develop only
after experience. It is just arbitrarily that I am calling it
“enlightenment.” But it is very arbitrary; it does not really give you
the sense that Buddha’s word gives. He calls it nirvana.</p><p>I can explain the word to you. Nirvana means ceasing to be.
Strange... ceasing to be. I could have used that word, but that would
make you afraid. Already people are so much afraid of me – I, who have
never done any harm to anybody.</p><p>Not to be is nirvana. That does not mean that you are no more; it
simply means you are no longer an entity, embodied. Yes, in that sense
you are no more, but that is the way – not to be is the way to be all.
The dewdrop drops into the ocean. You can say it has died, but those who
know will say it has become oceanic. Now it is the whole ocean.</p><p>Existence is alive at every stage. Nothing is dead. Even a stone –
which you think seems to be completely dead – is not dead. So many
living electrons are running so fast inside it that you cannot see them,
but they are all living beings. Their bodies are so small that nobody
has seen them; we don’t even have any scientific instrument to see the
electron, it is only guesswork. We can see the effect; hence we think
there must be a cause. The cause has not been seen, only the effect has
been seen. But the electron is as alive as you are.</p><p>The whole existence is synonymous with life. Here nothing dies. Death
is an impossibility.</p><p>Yes, things change from one form to another form till they become
mature enough that they need not go to school again. Then they move into
a formless life, then they become one with the ocean itself.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>17</span></p><p><br></p><p>The death of the mind is the birth of you</p><p><br></p><p>15 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS I’VE LIVED IN YOUR COMMUNES. YOU ARE HERE, ALL
MY FRIENDS ARE HERE; EVERYTHING I LOVE AND VALUE IS HERE. AND YET, I
OFTEN THINK OF LEAVING. WHAT’S WRONG?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what is wrong. You have all your friends here, all that you
love, all that you have aspired to. When one comes to a point of having
all, a great desire to escape from it arises – for the simple reason
that the mind wants more and more and more. If all is available, the
mind starts feeling restless; it has nothing to do.</p><p>It is a strange fact that poor countries and their people are more
satisfied and contented, compared to the rich countries and their
people, because the poor can hope and hopes keep them going. If you
reach the final rung of the ladder, you are suddenly at a loss; you
cannot hope anymore, there is nothing to hope for.</p><p>The mind and its functioning has to be understood; the continuous
desire for more has to be understood. It is very sick.</p><p><br></p><p>One should start looking into one’s desire to leave when everything
is available. Who is prompting this desire? The mind wants more, and
there is no more anymore. The mind is bound to create turmoil in you to
escape. And the dichotomy is that on the other hand you see, “All is
available here.</p><p><br></p><p>Where am I going to be and what am I going to gain by going there?”
It is sheer stupidity. But this</p><p>mind comes from the monkeys and is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to learn not to be identified with the mind. You have to be
just a watcher, and see all the buffoonery that the mind goes on doing
around you. Don’t applaud, don’t support, don’t negate – just watch.
Take no action against the mind because that is also part of the mind.
Only one thing in you is the door, and that is witnessing, because it is
not part of the mind. It is simple to understand: if you can witness
your mind, certainly you are not the mind. Anything that you can see in
front of you, you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole simple and open secret of meditation. Whatever the
monkey within you is doing, watch, with no judgment, because any
judgment is either going to be for or against; you have become party to
the foolishness of the mind. Neither for or against, just remain
watchful of what is happening and this desire to leave will disappear,
because you will be able to see that what you wanted is here. So where
are you going? And this mind will be with you wherever you go, and it
will not allow you any rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind always wants to go on and on, because that is its very
lifeblood. Stopping, even for a single moment, the mind dies. And the
death of the mind is the birth of you. While the mind has power over
you, you are not born yet.</p><p>All the great masters in the East were either kings, or princes who
were going to become kings. Buddha, Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Bahubali –
what happened to these people? Not a single poor man in the whole
history of the East has become a great master, for the simple reason
that he still has hope.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope is your opium. It keeps you going. It is just there, you have to
stretch your hand a little bit more. It is hanging just before you: a
little effort and it will be yours. It is not going to be so; it will
always go on hanging just there. It will not be too far because that may
create the idea, “Perhaps I cannot manage to go that far. I don’t have
the strength. The journey is very long.” So your hope is not very far
away, just close enough so that it would be foolish not to get it. By
the time you get it, it is still there in some different form.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why religions in the East – particularly in India – have a
flavor that religions which are not born there don’t have. In India,
three religions have existed for thousands of years: Jainism is the
oldest, then Hinduism, then Buddhism. Jainas have twenty-four
tirthankaras, the great masters. But strangely enough, all twenty-four
came from royal families. Either they were already kings or they were
going to be kings sooner or later. And they escaped – they had
everything, just at their fingertips they had the whole world. That was
the problem; they had to escape.</p><p><br></p><p>In Buddhism there is a strange story – but worth understanding,
because it is the story of each of you. When Buddha was born, the great
astrologers said to the king, “We are afraid, but you have to be made
aware of it: this newborn baby is either going to become a chakravartin”
– a chakravartin means one who rules over the whole world – “or he is
going to become a beggar who owns nothing.”</p><p>... two extremes.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was old and this was his only son, born in his old age. He
asked the astrologers how to prevent him from becoming a beggar and
renouncing the world. Those astrologers had no idea of</p><p><br></p><p>mind and psychology. Astrologers may have ideas about faraway stars,
whose light takes millions of light years to reach the earth.… And what
a foolishness, that man thinks his fate, his destiny, is determined by
all these millions of stars so far away!</p><p>There is a reason why astrology has remained significant: it gives
you great satisfaction that the whole universe is interested in you.
Even the faraway stars are trying their best to do something to you; you
are not an ordinary person, you are not nothing. Those faraway stars are
not even aware of you, cannot be, but your ego feels tremendous
satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrologers have been exploiting this since the very beginning of
man. Of course, they exploit you, you have to pay for it, but it seems
worth paying them; they are giving you a big ego. You are bigger, far
more important, than the biggest star in the sky. They are all just
revolving around you!</p><p><br></p><p>But those poor astrologers were not even as intelligent as Sigmund
Freud. They told the king, “If you want him not to renounce the world,
then a few arrangements have to be made.”</p><p>In India there are three clear-cut seasons in the year. Since the
atomic explosions around the world, that has changed; otherwise, every
year on the same day the rains will begin, and on the same day they will
stop. On the same day the winter comes, and after four months on the
same day it stops. For centuries it has been absolutely certain. Now it
is not so, but in Buddha’s time it was certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s father made three palaces, one for each season. For summer,
a palace in the hill station: cool, beautiful, green. Every care was
taken that Buddha would never become disappointed with the world. For
winter, a warm and cozy atmosphere was made in the palace.</p><p><br></p><p>The astrologers told the king, “From the very beginning let him be
surrounded with beautiful girls, so by</p><p>the time he becomes a young man he has all the beautiful girls of the
land.”</p><p><br></p><p>They even went into details: that he should not see any old man,
because in his seeing an old man the question could arise in him, “Is
this the destiny for everyone?” Never allow him to see a dead body. Keep
him absolutely unaware of the realities of life, keep him in a
dreamland. Their argument was, when he has everything, why should he
renounce?</p><p>The greatest physician of the country was looking after him. Even the
gardeners in the king’s garden were told that Buddha should not see a
flower withering away or a leaf turning pale. In the night everything
that indicates death had to be removed. He should see only beautiful
flowers which are always young. He should see only green leaves which
are always green.</p><p><br></p><p>And this the king could manage. He managed it – and his management
backfired. Those idiotic astrologers had no idea of a simple fact: that
if you give a man everything and keep him unaware of all that is ugly
around, soon he is going to be fed up with it. Soon he will start
thinking, “Is this all? Then tomorrow is going to be the same, and the
day after tomorrow is going to be the same. What is the point?” He will
become bored.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what happened. Buddha became bored with unchanging
beautiful women, unchanging beautiful flowers. How long can your mind
keep silent? The astrologers were the reason why Buddha renounced the
kingdom. If he had been allowed to live just the ordinary life of every
man, perhaps</p><p><br></p><p>there would have been no Buddha. In a way, the idiotic astrologers
unknowingly did a great service to humanity.</p><p>The story is beautiful. There used to be an annual festival in the
capital, and the prince who was going to be king used to inaugurate it,
declare it open. It lasted for a few weeks – all kinds of things, all
kinds of athletic games, shows. Buddha was going to inaugurate this
youth festival in his twenty- ninth year.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way every care was taken – but existence has a way to reach
you. You cannot remain completely closed in a grave, unless you are
dead. If you are alive, there are bound to be loopholes from where
existence will enter and make you aware of the reality. The astrologers
and the kings could not be more intelligent than existence itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Every care was taken that on the way from the palace to the festival
stadium, no old men should be seen, no dead bodies should be carried –
nothing that could create a questioning in Buddha. But you cannot avoid
reality for long. As the chariot was going towards the festival grounds,
Buddha saw an old man. The old man was deaf and he had not heard that
today he was not to pass on this road, he was to remain in the house or
go somewhere else. He was deaf, he could not hear it, so just as usual
he came out of his house; he was going to purchase something from the
market.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha, for the first time in twenty-nine years, saw an old man just
on the borderline of death. He asked his charioteer, “What is the
matter? What has happened to this man? I have never seen anything like
this!”</p><p><br></p><p>The charioteer loved Buddha just as his own son. He could not lie. He
said, “Although it is going against the orders of your father, I cannot
lie to you. You have been prevented from seeing people getting old.
Everybody gets old – I will get old. This is the way of life.”</p><p>Buddha immediately asked, “Am I also going to be old one day just
like this man?”</p><p><br></p><p>The charioteer said, “I have to say the truth to you: I would like
that this should not happen to you, but it is the law of nature; nothing
can be done. Just as from childhood you have become a young man, from
youth you will become one day old too.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then, just then, somebody died. Now you cannot prevent death. You
cannot order death, “You are not to happen on this road, you can happen
anywhere else.” Death is not in your hands. Somebody died, people were
crying, and the dead body was there.</p><p>Buddha asked, “What has happened? Why are people crying?” He had
never seen anybody crying, he had never seen anybody with tears; he had
never seen anybody dead. He asked, “What has happened to this man? He is
not even breathing!”</p><p><br></p><p>The charioteer said, “This is the second stage. First you saw the old
man. Soon death will come to him too. It has come to this man.”</p><p>Buddha asked, “Am I also going to die one day?”</p><p><br></p><p>The charioteer – afraid of the king, but he must have been a man of
some integrity – said, “Truth is truth, nobody can deny it. Your father
the king is going to die, I am going to die, you are going to die. Death
begins the day you are born. After birth there is no way to escape
death.”</p><p>And just then they passed a sannyasin. Astrologers had said to the
king, “Your son should not be allowed any contact with sannyasins,
because those are the people who have renounced everything. Those are
the people who teach that this world is illusion, that all your desires
are going to lead you nowhere, that you are simply wasting your life,
and death is coming close by every moment. Sannyasins have to be
avoided.” And for twenty-nine years Buddha had no notion that there are
people who are trying to find something which is beyond life and
death.</p><p><br></p><p>This red-clothed sannyasin looked very strange to him – just as when
you move into the world outside the commune you look strange to people.
They are living a life of dreams. You suddenly come, and you shock them!
Questions, enquiries: “What has happened to you? Why are you wearing a
red robe?”</p><p><br></p><p>And a man who has not seen a sannyasin his whole life, for
twenty-nine years, is bound to be more enquiring. He said, “And what
about this man? I have seen people, but nobody wears a loose robe like
this, with a begging bowl in his hand. What kind of man is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>The charioteer said, “This man has understood that beauty is going to
turn into ugliness, that youth is going to turn into old age, that life
is going to turn into death, and he is trying to find, ‘Is there
something eternal? Is there something which is not affected by youth, by
old age, by death, by disease?’ He is a sannyasin, he has renounced the
ordinary world. He</p><p><br></p><p>is a seeker of truth.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were just reaching the stadium. Buddha said to the charioteer,
“Turn back – I am not going to the youth festival. If youth is finally
going to become old age, disease, death, and if this is going to happen
to me, then I have lost twenty-nine years uselessly. I have lived in
dreams. I am no longer young, and I am no longer interested in being the
prince. Tonight I am going to renounce this world and be a seeker of
truth.”</p><p>What the astrologers had thought looked like common sense... but
common sense is superficial. They could not think a simple thing: that
you cannot keep a man for his whole life unaware of reality. It is
better to let him know from the very beginning; otherwise it will come
as a big explosion in his life. And that’s what happened. That very
night Buddha escaped from the palace where everything was available.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, all these three religions’ great masters come from royalty.
That’s why there is a great difference, almost unbridgeable, between
Christianity and Buddhism, between Mohammedanism and Jainism. The
difference comes because Jesus is not a prince. He comes from a poor
family, he is the son of a poor carpenter, Joseph. He knows all, nothing
is hidden from him. His religion is going to be the poor man’s religion.
No wonder all around the world poor people go on turning into
Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, I have traveled continually trying to find a single rich
man who became a Christian, and I have not found one. Those who become
Christians are orphans, beggars, starving people. Of</p><p><br></p><p>course they cannot understand Buddhism because Buddha does not turn
stones into bread, and that’s what they want. Buddha does not change
water into wine; on the contrary, he prohibits you because any alcoholic
drug is going to destroy your meditativeness. He is not going to raise a
dead man from the grave and bring him back to life. What is the point –
he will go again. Why give him trouble?</p><p>Do you know what happened to Lazarus?</p><p><br></p><p>Even if Jesus raised him from the dead – which is nonsense<span class=s6></span>For the argument’s sake if we accept</p><p>that yes, he was raised from death back to life, then what happened
to him? Where is Lazarus? He will have to die again so what is the
point? Maybe a few years more of misery and poverty, sickness, anxiety
and anguish – and you call it a miracle? And again he will be back in
the grave. At least in the grave he will be without anxiety, without
poverty, without sickness, and without any fear of death. It has already
happened, now it cannot happen again. Jesus really was unkind if he did
raise Lazarus from death.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha would not do it. It is not a miracle, it is foolishness. A
similar case happened in Buddha’s life: a young child died; the father
had died, and the woman was living only for this child. That young child
was her whole life and her only hope; otherwise, there was nothing for
her to live for. And the child died. She was almost on the verge of
going crazy. She wouldn’t allow people to take the child to the
crematorium. She was hugging the child in the hope that perhaps he might
start breathing again. She was ready to give her life if the child could
live.</p><p><br></p><p>The people said, “This is not possible, it is against the law of
nature.” But she was in such misery, she could not listen to anybody.
Then somebody said, “The best way is, let us take this woman to Gautam
Buddha who, just by chance, is in the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>This appealed to the woman. A man like Gautam Buddha can do anything,
and this is a small miracle – nothing much – that the child starts
breathing again. She went, crying and weeping, put the child’s dead body
at the feet of Buddha, and asked him, “You are a great master, you know
the secrets of life and death, and I have come with great hope. Make my
child alive again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “That I will do, but you have to fulfill a condition
before I do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “I am ready to fulfill any condition. I am ready to give my
life, but let my child live.”</p><p>Buddha said, “No, the condition you have to fulfill is very simple.
You just go around the village and find a few mustard seeds from a house
where death has never happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was in such despair, she went from one house to another. And
those people said, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want,
but those mustard seeds will not help you. Not only one, but many have
died in our family; perhaps thousands have died.”</p><p>By the evening, a great awakening had happened to the woman. She had
gone through the whole</p><p>village, and the same reply<span class=s6></span>They were all
ready to help her but they said, “These mustard seeds won’t help. Buddha
has made it clear to you, ‘Bring the mustard seeds from a family where
nobody has ever died.’”</p><p><br></p><p>By the evening, when she returned, she was a totally different woman.
She was not the same woman who had come in the morning. She had become
absolutely aware that death is a reality of life – it cannot be changed.
And what is the point? “Even if my child lives for a few years, he will
have to die again. In the first place it is not possible; in the second
place, even if it were possible, it is pointless.”</p><p>Now there were no more tears in her eyes, she was very quiet, serene.
A tremendous understanding had come to her: that she was asking for the
impossible. She dropped that desire. She came and fell at Buddha’s
feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Where are the mustard seeds? I have been waiting the
whole day.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman instead of crying, laughed. She said, “You played a good
joke. Forget all about the child, what is gone is gone. Now I have come
to be initiated and to become a sannyasin. The way you have found the
truth which never dies, I also want to find. I am no longer concerned
with the child or anybody else. My concern is now, how to find the truth
which never dies, which is life itself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Forgive me that I had to ask you for something I knew
was impossible. But it was a</p><p>simple device to bring you to your senses, and it worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>I call this a miracle. Lazarus being raised from the grave is not a
miracle; it is just a bogus story created by the Christians to make
their master appear as the greatest master in the world, who can do such
miracles, who can walk on water. Nobody can walk on water. I find it
difficult even to walk on the ground! Do you want me to walk on water? I
will become enlightened again!</p><p><br></p><p>One very rich, super-rich Jew was visiting Jerusalem in the holy
land, Israel, and he was going around seeing all the places. He saw Lake
Galilee where Jesus used to walk on water. He did not believe it – he
was a Jew, he was not a Christian. But he told the boatman that he would
like to go around the lake – it is a really beautiful place.</p><p><br></p><p>The boatman was a Christian. He had no idea that this man is a Jew
because Israel is a holy land for Christians too, and Christians are
coming daily to the boatman to take them around the lake where Jesus
walked. This water is no longer ordinary water; this lake is no longer
an ordinary lake. Jesus walking on it has made it something holy,
something divine.</p><p><br></p><p>But he could not see that the man was a Jew, not a Christian... only
Christians used to come there. One thing he could see: that he was
American, rich – he has come in a big limousine. So he raised his price.
Ordinarily he was asking only one dollar to go all around the lake; he
asked for twenty dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jew said, “My God, twenty dollars! Now I know why Jesus used to
walk on water – for the first time I have discovered the truth. From
where would that poor guy get twenty dollars? Of course he had to walk
on water! I am not going to walk on water, and I am not going to give
you twenty dollars either!”</p><p>Christianity and Mohammedanism are the two religions born outside of
India. Mohammed was also a very poor man, uneducated, just capable of
somehow managing two meals a day. He was a</p><p><br></p><p>shepherd – not metaphorically, as Jesus goes on calling himself the
shepherd and you the sheep. Mohammed was actually a shepherd; that was
his job.</p><p>Mohammedanism and Christianity are the two religions created by poor
people. They don’t have that elegance, that delicacy, that flavor, that
comes from meditation. They don’t have even the word “meditation” in
their vocabulary. They are the religions of prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer makes you a beggar; meditation makes you a master. Prayer is a
degradation: you are humiliating yourself, falling on your knees,
folding your hands towards the sky, knowing nothing of what you are
doing. And what do you ask in your prayer? “Give us more wealth, give us
more life, give us more health.” What else can you ask?</p><p><br></p><p>And religion is not for those who ask. Religion is for those who
give. But to give in the first place you have to have. You have to
experience the life that is flowing in you; you have to experience the
consciousness that you are. Then suddenly you are no longer a beggar and
prayer becomes absolutely absurd. There is no one to whom the prayer can
be addressed, and there is no need – even if someone is there – because
meditation opens the doors to your own treasures.</p><p>Unless you are in a meditative state, this mind of yours will go on
being a beggar. You may have everything, but the mind wants more. That
is what I mean by being a beggar: always wanting more, more, more And
there is no end to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation does not desire for anything. There is no idea of more.
Meditation simply wants to know, “What is in me? If I can discover my
own center, I have discovered the center of all” – because the center of
you is not only the center of you. On the circumference we are
different, but at the center... there is only one center, it is
universal. It is at the center that I and you and everybody meet and
become one.</p><p>It is easy to understand your desire, that you have everything here –
but that is the trouble. What do you want? – that things should be taken
away from you so you can start again and not feel stuck? No, more and
more will be given to you. And that is creating a dichotomy, because on
the other hand, you would not like to lose what you have got. That is
the schizophrenic nature of the mind.</p><p>All minds are schizophrenic. Mind as such is sick. Mind creates a
split in you: you would like to have all this, all that is available
here, so you cannot go away. And you have everything that you wanted
available to you, and the mind wants more. You have to decide and choose
between mind and meditation. Mind is a beggar, and meditation is a
master.</p><p><br></p><p>Become master of your own self. And I would like you to become more
and more rich in every dimension, because I accept life in its totality.
I would like my commune to be the richest, to be the most intelligent,
to be in the best of health. I would like my commune to change into
paradise. But that is possible only if you drop this crazy mind which
goes on asking for more. And it is only a question of simply
understanding and shifting your energies from the mind to the witnessing
consciousness. Don’t be identified with the mind, because you are not
it, you are the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Without knowing it, your question itself makes it clear that you are
a witness. You are witnessing that you have everything here, there is no
need to go anywhere – and anyway you cannot go. This</p><p><br></p><p>is your home, these people are your people. You cannot find so much
love and life and laughter anywhere in the world. So you cannot go. But
once in a while the mind will create the disturbance and say, “Here you
are just stuck. Nothing is happening.”</p><p>I am answering the question because it happens to many people, and
they go on writing to me, “What to do? I would just like to go in the
outside world for a few days, the mind is going crazy. I don’t want to
miss anything, and I know I am not going to get anything there, but what
to do with the mind? It says, ‘Just go for a three week holiday. Go to
the beach.’” And during all those three weeks on the beach, your mind
will say, “What are you doing here? You are an idiot! All that was
beautiful, lovable, you have left behind.”</p><p>In fact, we are constantly enjoying a holiday. Where can you go? If
there is anything missing here, we are able to create it, to bring it
here. Rather than you going to the beach, we can bring the beach here!
And that will be far better, because one person going on a holiday...
you will miss your friends, and you will miss this great family.</p><p>And you will find you are just an outsider there. You will not be
able to mix with the people outside the commune. You have changed so
much that you and they are living in two different worlds. They will not
be able to understand you, nor will you be able to understand them.</p><p>Drop the mind. Move towards the witness. Then you will be immensely
attuned with the milieu here. If anything is missing, so many
intelligent people can create it. And we have to create something that
the whole world feels jealous of!</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ON MY WAY FROM THE CITY OF RAJNEESH TO RAJNEESHPURAM, I SAW MANY
SIGNS ALONG THE ROAD WHICH ARE AGAINST YOU. THE LAST ONE, JUST BEFORE
THE TURN TO RAJNEESHPURAM, SAID, “ALL YOU WHO ENTER HERE SHALL GIVE UP
HOPE.” IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING TO HOPE FOR?</p><p>Those fanatic Christians are writing all these things, but they don’t
know that these things are not against me. They have written what I am
teaching you! You are entering here; there is no hope, no hope even of
getting out from here!</p><p>Those idiots who have written that will be thinking that this will
stop you entering Rajneeshpuram. In fact it is an invitation, because
hope brings hopelessness, sure and certain. All hopelessness in man
exists because he hopes.</p><p>You have heard the proverb: Man proposes and God disposes. There is
no God who disposes. Man certainly proposes, and hopes that it will be
fulfilled. Nature has no obligation to fulfill your desires, crazy
demands. Existence is available only for those who have dropped hope,
because every hope is against existence.</p><p>Do you see the point? Every hope is against existence. Every prayer
is against existence. You are asking for something that existence has
not given to you. You are trying to get something that existence is not
willing to give you. Perhaps you don’t deserve it.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t teach you hope, because to teach hope means that following
the hope, just like a shadow,</p><p>with be hopelessness. I teach you to enjoy whatsoever is.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope is always in the future, and you are always in the present. How
can there be a bridge between the hope and you? Existence is here, hope
is there – the bridge is not possible. Every hope is going to be
frustrated. If you enjoy being frustrated, if you love to be hopeless,
then you can hope as much as you like.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to be blissful, to be blessed, then all hopes have to be
dropped. Just visualize for a single</p><p>moment that you don’t have any hope. Immediately you can see
hopelessness also disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very significant question. If you ask for the meaning of life
you will feel meaninglessness. Jean-Paul Sartre feels life is
meaningless. Life is neither meaningless nor meaningful, life simply is.
But if you try to find some meaning in it, naturally that meaning is not
there. You are the creator of your meaninglessness. And then despair,
anguish.…</p><p><br></p><p>Life simply is. Enjoy it! Why hope? When life is here, you are
wasting your life and time in hoping, and then one day you will find
those hopes cannot be fulfilled. Then you will suffer hopelessness. This
is all your own creation: hope, hopelessness; meaning,
meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have any hope. That does not mean hopelessness. Hopelessness
is the other side of hope. Throw away the coin of hope and the
hopelessness is thrown away too. You cannot save one – you cannot have a
one-sided coin – the other side will be there. You can go on deceiving
yourself, but for how long? And whom are you kidding? Just wasting your
life.…</p><p><br></p><p>People have been asking me, “What is the meaning of life?” Now, if I
say there is no meaning, they feel sad. It is not life that is making
them sad, it is their stupid question – “What is the meaning of life?” –
that is creating the sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t ask for the meaning. Why should there be any meaning? What is
the meaning of a roseflower? But it blossoms, releases its fragrance.
What is its hope? Is the roseflower hoping that somebody will come and
say, “How beautiful!” That somebody will pass by and say, “What
fragrance!” No, the roseflower even flowers in a place where nobody
passes by, nobody sees it, nobody feels it.</p><p>In the Himalayas there is a place, a valley, which is called the
Valley of the Gods, for the simple reason that it is impossible to go
deep down into that valley – steep hills surround it. But in that valley
where nobody goes – there is no way to go, no path, and it is so deep
that you can only see it from the hilltop – in that valley there have
been growing for millennia, beautiful flowers. I have seen it. I think
there must be many flowers which are not even known to us, which are not
even named by the scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>The valley is completely just flowers and flowers. For whom are they
blossoming? For whom are they waiting? What is their hope? There is no
hope, there is no desire. They are not waiting for somebody, they are
simply enjoying themselves blossoming to their completion. They are
enjoying the sun, they are enjoying the hills, they are enjoying the
other flowers blossoming all around. They are enjoying the moon in the
night, and the stars in the night. But remember, there is no meaning and
there is no hope.</p><p><br></p><p>Destroy all hope in you and you will never be hopeless, you will
never feel hopelessness. Drop the enquiry into the meaning of life and
you will never feel it is meaningless. I am not saying that you will
start feeling it is meaningful, no. You will be freed completely from
meaning and meaninglessness, from hope and hopelessness. And there is no
need for them. You can just enjoy.</p><p>And the whole existence is enjoying except man. Something is crazy
about man. The trees must be laughing at you; the rocks must be
thinking, “What has happened to you? Why this sadness?” The birds must
be thinking, “This whole humanity has gone mad.” And it has gone
mad.</p><p>Sanity is to enjoy the moment. Whatever it brings to you, relish,
rejoice. I teach you the moment and its joys, and I want you to
completely drop dreaming about hopes. Your dreams about hopes have
helped you to be exploited by the priests. They give you the hope; they
say, “This life is hopeless, but there is a life beyond the grave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange... everything is beyond the grave and nobody comes back from
the grave to say, “Yes, the priests are right.” Not a single man has
come back from the grave to say, “These priests are perfectly right: all
that you are hoping for, desiring for, is abundantly available in the
kingdom of God – but that kingdom of God is beyond the grave.” My
kingdom of godliness is here, now, this very moment. Who cares about
tomorrow?</p><p><br></p><p>Only people who are living in despair cling to hope. That hope keeps
them dragging on: “If it is not happening today, it will happen
tomorrow; it is just a question of a little more waiting.” But you are
waiting for Godot, who is never going to come.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, existence is pouring on you all its treasures this very
moment, but you are not here! You are digging in the future, and the
future is only a projection of your mind.</p><p>Those who cannot think of the future start thinking of the past. Old
people are afraid: death is coming, tomorrow is death! And their whole
life and its experience has raised many doubts in them: who knows
whether after death all that you wanted will be available? There is not
a single eyewitness. The old man starts being afraid of death. He turns
his eyes towards the past which he has lived – he starts remembering the
beautiful days of youth, the wonderful days of childhood.</p><p>And I tell you, he is inventing it. When he was a child, he was as
miserable as anything. When he was a young man, he was burdened with all
kinds of miseries and problems. Now that death is coming near, he cannot
look forward – there is only the darkness of the grave. He turns his
back towards the grave and starts looking at the past, which he has not
lived, which he has missed! A strange phenomenon... when you are a child
you are wanting to grow up and become a young person because young
people are enjoying so much.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to go for a morning walk, and there was a post office nearby.
I knew the postmaster, I knew his family. One day, early in the morning
– it must have been five o’clock, it was still dark – I saw a small boy
with a mustache passing by my side. I could not believe that a small
boy... I ran after him and caught hold of him, and he said, “Please
don’t tell my father.”</p><p>But I said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Whenever I see somebody with a mustache, I feel so bad that
I don’t have any mustache. I have purchased this, but don’t tell my
father. I enjoy it very much.”</p><p>I said, “What else do you enjoy? I will not tell your father.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Promise?” I said, “Promise.”</p><p>He took out a pack of cigarettes. He said, “I enjoy cigarettes,
although I start coughing and the taste</p><p>is bad. But what to do? One has to enjoy. So many people smoking And
I am waiting to come of age, but it is coming so slowly.”</p><p>In old age this boy will remember, “Wonderful were the days of my
childhood,” and that will be simply</p><p>imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is real is here.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are a child, or a young man, a young woman, or an old
man, or on your deathbed, all that is to be experienced is here. And
here is the only time, and the only place. There is no “there” anywhere,
past or future. There is no “then” past or future. It is always here,
now.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin – of course
he is from California. He is a man but he wants to wear the clothes of a
woman. He says he enjoys it so much but he is afraid that somebody will
find out. So, closing his doors, he puts on women’s clothes. He was
asking me, “Is it okay? And can I move in the commune in women’s
clothes?”</p><p><br></p><p>No woman is enjoying her clothes, and this guy is enjoying women’s
clothes! I receive letters from women saying that they want to change
their sex, they want to become men. What can you say to these fools?
Can’t you see the men all around you? And it is happening in the world:
men are changing their sex, becoming women; women are changing their sex
and becoming men. What could be the cause of this?</p><p>You cannot enjoy whatsoever you are, wherever you are. You are always
thinking that the other guy is smarter, that men are enjoying, that
women are enjoying. You are all in the same ship – and nobody is
enjoying. And of course, once you have changed your sex from a man and
become a woman, you cannot say that now you are not enjoying it; that
would look very stupid. You went through such a process – painful
operations, plastic surgery – and now to say that it was useless would
not be right. You brag that you are enjoying, that it has been a great
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot conceive that a man becoming a woman or a woman becoming a
man can be a great experience. It is bragging. You have done something
stupid; now to accept the stupidity of it is embarrassing, it is better
now to go on pretending. But I know... People who have changed their sex
have written to me that there is nothing great in it, it is the same,
you just change one place for another place. But you are the same,
because you are not your body, you are not your mind. You are
consciousness, and no plastic surgery can change your consciousness –
your consciousness will remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to become blissful is to raise your consciousness from
its dormant position. It is fast asleep, because you have never bothered
about it. You are searching all over the world, leaving only one spot
that is deep within you, and the key is there.</p><p>My whole effort in creating communes all around the world is to make
you aware of this tremendous gift of existence, these flowers that are
showering continuously on you. But your eyes are focused somewhere
else.</p><p><br></p><p>You are closed to the present; that is the only misery, the only
hell. Be open to the moment; that is the only heaven and the only
blessed state.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>18</span></p><p><br></p><p>Silence does the miracle</p><p><br></p><p>16 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ARE THESE ILLUSIONS OF GOD AND EGO ONE AND THE SAME?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The moment ego is found illusory, immediately God also
disappears. Ego is an imaginary center in individuals, and God is the
imaginary center of the whole universe. They are related to each other,
dependent on each other. Neither God can exist without ego in you, nor
can ego exist without God there above, in heaven. God is the ego of the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a coincidence that all the religions emphasize both
together – God and you. They try to make your ego more and more – at
least in appearance – a reality. To make the ego they have all kinds of
disciplines: you have to do this, you have not to do this – because the
ego cannot exist when you are not doing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if you have a torch of fire in your hand; if you go on
moving it round and round fast enough, you will see a circle of fire –
which does not exist. It is illusory, you just cannot see the gaps. It
is just a single fire, a flame, but moved fast it becomes a circle. That
circle is simply not there. Stop moving your hand and the circle
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions go on teaching you, “Do something – fast,
exercises, prayers; go to churches, mosques, synagogues. Read the holy
scripture every day.” These are all methods to create the ego in you.
The torch goes on moving and goes on creating the illusory circle.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you start feeling that you have a center in you, it becomes
very easy for you to believe that there must be a center to the whole.
If each individual is moving on a center, then the whole existence must
be moving on a center, and that center is God. Ego strengthened in you
creates the belief, the faith in – God, and makes it look very
logical.</p><p>What I am doing here is just the opposite. I want you first to learn
moments of non-doing, moments when you simply are, not doing anything –
the torch has stopped moving in a circle – and you are amazed. The
moment you are silent, not doing anything at all, suddenly, in a
strange, mysterious way, the old you has disappeared, evaporated, and a
new feeling of being arises.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is separate from others, has to be. It has its own territory.
The bigger the territory, the bigger ego you can have. If you become the
president of America, of course your ego becomes millions of times
bigger. You have much money, and you go on and on accumulating money –
that feeds the illusion; your territory, your power, goes on
increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to know a state of utter nothingness. That is your
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The child is not born with an ego. Ego is being taught by the
society, religion, culture. You must have watched little babies: they
don’t say, “I am hungry.” If the baby’s name is Bob, he says, “Bob is
hungry. Bob wants to go to the toilet.” He has no sense of “I”. He
indicates himself also in the third person. Bob is something that people
call him, so he also calls himself Bob. But a day will come... as he
grows you will start teaching him that this is not right. “Bob is the
name for others to call you; you have to stop calling yourself Bob. You
are a separate personality, you have to learn to call yourself ‘I’.”</p><p>The day Bob becomes “I,” he loses the reality of being and falls into
the dark abysmal pit of an hallucination. Once he calls himself “I”
there is a totally different energy functioning. Now the “I” wants to
grow, it wants to become big; it wants this, it wants that. It wants to
rise higher and higher in the world of hierarchies. It wants a bigger
territorial imperative.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody has a bigger “I” than you, it creates an inferiority
complex in you. You make every effort to be superior-than-thou,
holier-than-thou, bigger-than-thou. Now your whole life is dedicated to
one stupid thing – which does not exist in the first place. You are on a
dream path. You will go on moving, making your “I” bigger, and bigger.
And it creates almost all your problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Alexander the Great had immense problems. The “I” within him
wanted to be the world conqueror, and he had almost conquered the world.
I say almost for two reasons. In his time, half of the world was not
known, America was not known. Secondly, he entered India, but he could
not conquer India; he returned from the boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not very old, he was just thirty-three. But in these
thirty-three years he had been simply fighting, fighting, fighting. He
had become sick, bored with the fight, killing, murder, blood. He wanted
to go back home and rest, and even that was not fulfilled. He could not
reach his home in Athens. He died just one day before he was supposed to
reach Athens; Athens was only twenty-four hours away.</p><p><br></p><p>But his whole life’s experience – growing richer, bigger, more and
more powerful, and then also feeling an utter helplessness, not even
capable of postponing his death for twenty-four hours And</p><p><br></p><p>he had promised his mother that once he had conquered the world he
would come and put the whole world at her feet as a gift. No son had
done that for any mother before, so it was something absolutely unique
that he was going to do.</p><p>But he felt helpless, surrounded by the best physicians. They all
said, “You cannot survive. This twenty-four hour journey... you will
die. It is better to rest here, perhaps there is a chance. But don’t
move. We don’t see much chance even for resting – you are drowning. You
are getting closer and closer, not to your home, but to your death; not
to your home, but to your grave.</p><p><br></p><p>“And we cannot help. We can cure sicknesses, we cannot cure death.
And this is not sickness. You are almost like a spent cartridge. In
thirty-three years you have spent all your life energy in fighting this
nation, that nation. You have wasted your life. It is not sickness, it
is simply that your life energy is spent, and spent uselessly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was a very intelligent man. He was a disciple of the great
logician and philosopher, Aristotle; Aristotle was his private tutor. He
died before reaching the capital. Before his death he told his commander
in chief, “This is my last wish, and this has to be fulfilled.” What was
his last wish? A very strange wish. The wish was, “When you carry my
coffin to the grave, you have to keep both my hands hanging out of the
coffin.”</p><p><br></p><p>The commander in chief asked, “What kind of wish is this? Hands are
always kept inside the coffin.</p><p>Nobody has ever heard of a coffin being carried to the grave with the
hands hanging out!”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “I don’t have much breath to explain to you, but in
short, I want to show to the world that I am going with empty hands. I
was thinking I was becoming bigger and bigger, richer and richer, but in
fact, I was becoming poorer and poorer. When I was born I had come into
the world with my fists closed, as if I was holding something within my
fists. Now at the moment of death, I cannot go with my fists
closed.”</p><p><br></p><p>To keep your fists closed you need life, some energy. No dead man has
been able to keep his hands closed. Who will close them? A dead man is
no longer there, all energy is gone – the hands open of their own
accord.</p><p>“Let everybody know that Alexander the Great is dying with his hands
empty, just a beggar.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t see that anybody has learned from those empty hands,
because people after Alexander</p><p>have continued to do the same in different ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s ego is the source of all his problems, all the wars, all the
conflicts, all the jealousies, fear, depression. Feeling oneself as a
failure, continuously comparing with others makes everybody hurt – and
hurt tremendously, because you can’t have everything. Somebody is more
beautiful than you, that hurts; somebody has more money that you, that
hurts; somebody is more knowledgeable than you, that hurts. Millions of
things are there to hurt you, but you don’t know, it is not those things
that are hurting you, because they don’t hurt me. They are hurting you
because of your ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is constantly trembling with fear, knowing perfectly well that it
is an artifact, an artificial device created by the society to keep you
running, chasing shadows. The politicians are happy, they want</p><p><br></p><p>you to go on running. This game of the ego, reaching higher and
higher, is politics. The priest is happy, you go on asking for his
blessings.</p><p>One of my friends was a cabinet minister in Indira Gandhi’s time.
When his election was coming near, he was very much afraid whether he
was going to win again or not. And now, being a cabinet minister, he was
hoping someday to become the prime minister. And to lose the election
and again be just nobody was very painful.</p><p><br></p><p>He came to me. He said, “I have never asked anything from you, but
this time, you bless me. I want to win this election. There is every
possibility that I will go higher in the cabinet. Perhaps I may become
the deputy prime minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have come to the wrong place” – because in India people
go to the saints for blessings. I said, “You have come to the wrong
place. If I really give you a blessing, you will fail utterly in your
election.”</p><p>He said, “What do you mean? What kind of blessing is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Your becoming a cabinet minister, a deputy prime minister,
or even a prime minister, is not really a blessing to you. You are going
in an hallucinatory direction. My blessing will bring you back to your
reality.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, many couples, when they got married, used to come for my
blessing. And Vivek used to tell them, “Don’t ask for his blessing,
because his blessing means divorce” – because she had seen, year by
year, whoever had asked for my blessing was finished, asking for my
blessing was the end of the relationship. But they could not understand
it. They had come to ask the blessing that for their lives they remain
devoted to each other, that their love goes on growing, their love
should not know any end, it should be endless.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is illusory. Everything that is born, dies. And the more
beautiful a thing is, the more delicate it is. Love is a beautiful
flower; it withers very easily. Yes, a relationship you can carry – that
is legal, social – but it will be a burden when the love between you has
stopped flowing. You will torture each other in every possible way.</p><p><br></p><p>My blessing can be that you enjoy the moment to the fullest, and if
in the next moment you feel the bridge has collapsed, then say good-bye
to each other – at least in a friendly, compassionate way.</p><p>The ego and all its games... marriage is its game, money is its game,
power is its game. All the games are the games of ego. The society up to
now has remained playing games; it is an ongoing Olympics all over the
world. Everybody is fighting his way upwards, and everybody else is
pulling his legs down, because at the Everest peak there is not enough
space for you all to stand.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a cut-throat competition. And it becomes so important to you,
that you forget completely that this ego was planted in you by the
society, by the teachers. From the kindergarten to the university, what
are they doing? – strengthening your ego. More and more degrees go on
being added to your name, and you start feeling bigger and bigger and
bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is the greatest lie – which you have accepted as a truth. But all
vested interests are very much in favor of it, because if everybody
becomes aware of egolessness, this whole Olympics going on around the
world will simply come to a standstill. Nobody will want to climb
Everest, they will enjoy wherever they are. They will be rejoicing.</p><p>The ego keeps you waiting: tomorrow when you succeed, you will
rejoice. Today, of course, you have to suffer, you have to sacrifice. If
you want to succeed tomorrow, today you have to sacrifice. You have to
deserve success, and for that you are doing every kind of gymnastics.
And it is only a question of a little time to suffer, and then there is
rejoicing. But that tomorrow never comes. It has never come.</p><p>Tomorrow simply means that which never comes. It is postponing
living. It is a beautiful strategy to keep you suffering. Politicians
want you to suffer, priests want you to suffer, your educational system
wants you to suffer. They all teach you that sacrifice is great:
Sacrifice – only then will you be able to find something to rejoice in;
sacrifice is the way.</p><p><br></p><p>I say it categorically, No! Sacrifice is the invention of the cunning
people. There is no need to sacrifice anything because all that you need
to rejoice is already here within you.</p><p><br></p><p>But the ego cannot rejoice in the present. It cannot exist in the
present; it exists only in the future, in the past – that which is not.
The past is no more, the future is not yet; both are non-existential.
Ego can exist only with the non-existential, because it itself is
non-existent.</p><p><br></p><p>In the present, pure moment you will find no ego in you – simply a
silent joy, a silent and pure nothingness.</p><p>But the priest is afraid: if you come to know this nothingness, you
will know immediately there is no God, because if you can exist without
any crystallized center, why cannot the whole existence exist the same
way?</p><p><br></p><p>God is nothing but your ego multiplied by everybody else’s ego. God
is the biggest ego in the world. God is the greatest hallucination man
has suffered, and is still suffering. If you want your ego, then you
have to keep your belief in God intact. They remain together, they go
together.</p><p><br></p><p>Many questions have come to me, asking why I insistently destroy
people’s belief and faith in God. It is pure arithmetic: without
destroying God I cannot help you to destroy your ego. If there is no God
and existence can remain flowing, moving, growing, expanding; nobody is
controlling it, nobody is maintaining it, it is autonomous.…</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean when I say there is no God. I am saying existence
is autonomous. Trees are growing of their own accord, birds are flying
of their own accord, the sun is rising of its own accord. And it is
beautiful that nobody is behind this beautiful existence, turning it
into a puppeteer’s show. That’s what the religions teach – all the
religions without exception – that you are only a puppet. With God
there, you cannot be anything more than a puppet. The strings are in his
hand.</p><p>They have a proverb in India that not even a leaf moves without God’s
permission. Nothing happens without God’s permission, so this whole
existence is a permanent slavery. And it is very strange, the</p><p><br></p><p>same people who say, “Not even a leaf moves without his support<span class=s6></span>” Then how do people commit</p><p>murder? Then how do people commit rape? Then how do people become
thieves? If not even a leaf moves without him, the murderer is not
responsible, the rapist is not responsible. If anybody is responsible,
it is the puppeteer.</p><p><br></p><p>But strange... you will be punished for an act over which you have no
control. You will be thrown into hell because God managed to make a
murderer of you. It is God who manages Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir
Shah, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini. It is God. If one million
Jews are killed by Adolf Hitler, religions have no guts to say the
truth: that it is God who is pulling the strings of Adolf Hitler – the
poor puppet – and he is killing people.</p><p>Religions want you to be responsible for your acts on the one hand,
and on the other hand, God has created you, and everything that is in
you is created by God.</p><p>I have asked many saints, “How do you reconcile this contradiction?”
and I have never received any answer. They said, “It is beyond human
comprehension.” You can comprehend God, that he created the world. You
can comprehend that a particular sin will throw you into hell, another
particular act will take you to heaven. You can comprehend everything
else.…</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen in India, in temples, there are maps hanging which show
where hell is, where heaven is, where God lives, his house. These idiots
who made these maps didn’t know anything about America, because those
maps were made thousands of years ago. Even now they are hanging –
without America! They knew about heaven and hell, and they didn’t know
anything about this very earth on which they were living.</p><p><br></p><p>Your ego is just an idea implanted in your mind. It is poisonous.
Your ego keeps driving you madder and madder.</p><p>What I call meditation is nothing but a great decision on your part
to have a few moments at least when you are not doing anything – not
even thinking anything, because that is also an act. You simply are. In
that simple existence you will find no ego inside you, and it will bring
such clarity. Because all the turmoil of the ego is no longer there,
your vision takes wings, you can see that God is nothing but the ego of
the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can exist, breathe, be, and there is no sense of “I,” it makes
clear to you that there is no need for any God, that there is no need
for this slavery under which we have all lived for millennia, that you
are not a puppet, that you are an individual. And nobody is responsible
for your acts, remember. That is very significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did people decide to remain slaves for so long? Why did they
continue to believe in God, repressing their doubts and queries? – for
the simple reason that the presence of God makes you irresponsible. He
is the all-knower, he is everywhere; you are just to follow his
commandments.</p><p>And there are people like Moses who say that they have seen God,
heard him, and they bring stone tablets with commandments written on
them. They say, “This is God’s own handwriting.” Of course, he knew only
Hebrew, that’s why he wrote the commandments in Hebrew. And he gave his
commandments to Moses because the Jews are his chosen people.</p><p><br></p><p>This fiction that Moses created is responsible for all the miseries
Jews have suffered all through history. If you carry the idea that you
are the chosen people of God, then naturally you are superior to
everybody. As a by-product you are making everybody your enemy. And the
Jews are still carrying the same idea. God has been used by priests and
prophets and messiahs to keep you deluded, deceived. But why did you
accept all kinds of nonsense? There is a reason: it relieves you of all
responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are with me, I make you responsible for every act. And if
there is no God, and you are a free individual, naturally you have to be
very alert and awake, because there is no one protecting you from on
high. Even Jesus was under that delusion. On the cross he was crying,
“God, my Lord! Have you forsaken me?” He was thinking that God was
behind him; that was giving him an illusory strength and power. His
authority was because he was God’s messenger.</p><p>Jesus was fully convinced that on the cross God was going to come
down and prove to the whole world that Jesus was his only begotten son;
and those who were crucifying him would suffer in hell for eternity, and
those who were with him would be raised in glory to heaven, to enjoy it
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>These deluded people are your messiahs. These people need psychiatric
treatment! Instead of putting them in a madhouse, you have been
worshipping them. Why? The same reason: they relieve you of a great
thing – responsibility. They take your responsibility on their own
shoulders; and of course, they have a direct communication line with
God.</p><p>I want you to be silent, meditative, searching inside yourself,
looking... is anyone there? And you will be surprised – there is no one,
just pure existence, autonomous. There is no entity in you. You are part
and parcel of the whole existence. You are connected to the trees and to
the rivers and to the ocean in a thousand and one ways – visible,
invisible. You are not separate.</p><p>Can you remain alive without breathing? Perhaps for a few seconds you
can manage, because you have a certain storage of oxygen in your lungs.
So it is not a big deal that you can keep your nose closed and you can
dive in water for a few seconds. But soon you start feeling suffocated;
a little more and you will be finished. What are you doing when you
close your nose? You are disconnecting yourself from the atmosphere, the
air, that surrounds you. It is invisible, but it is very tangible. You
can feel it with your hand. You are constantly taking it in, sending it
out. It is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Eighty percent of your body is water – and not just water, but sea
water. That’s why you are constantly in need, not only of ordinary
water, you have to have sea water. That’s why salt is one of the most
necessary things in the world. In your body, inside, it is exactly the
same combination of salt water and other chemicals as in sea water.</p><p><br></p><p>When you go to the beach, why do you feel a sudden joy? The salty
breeze, the vast ocean. the waves. Why do you suddenly feel more alive?
Because you are part of it. Eighty percent of you is</p><p>part of the ocean! There is a certain need for your body, once in a
while, to be close to the ocean so you can renew your love affair with
it.</p><p>Why do you feel good looking at the green trees? When you go to a
lush, green forest something in you starts dancing. The cool breeze, the
green color surrounding you Do you know that trees are</p><p>constantly supplying you with oxygen, that you are constantly
supplying carbon dioxide to the trees, that you are not separate – you
are connected by very invisible bridges.</p><p><br></p><p>On the full moon night, you can see the ocean is affected: its waves
are bigger, as if it wants to touch the moon. Something in the ocean is
stirred by the full moon. It is now an established scientific fact that
your great oceans – the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian ocean – all
your great oceans are really the places from where the earth was removed
to make the moon.</p><p>In the beginning the earth was not solid, and when something is not
solid and is moving, spinning, it will throw off a few parts of itself
automatically because they are loose, they are not solid. The earth has
thrown off millions of its parts. When you see a star falling in the
night, it is not a star, it is just some part of the earth that has been
floating beyond the gravitation of the earth and has come back into the
area of gravitation. Two hundred miles around the earth is its area of
magnetism. Every night thousands of those stones enter, and this has
been going on for millions of years. Still they are not exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest part thrown off by the earth, was the moon. Of course, if
such a big part drops out, it leaves big holes on the earth. These holes
became oceans, water collected in them. On the full moon night something
in the earth remembers, something in the ocean stirs. They are still in
communication.</p><p><br></p><p>And you must remember that on the full moon night you also feel very
good. Poets for centuries have been writing poetry about the full moon.
Singers have been singing, musicians have been playing on their
instruments to the glory of the full moon. Why does this full moon
attract you? Because you are also eighty percent ocean.</p><p>More people go mad on the full moon night than any other night. More
people commit suicide on the full moon night than any other night. More
people have become enlightened on the full moon night than any other
night. It cannot be just coincidence – for millions of years the same
thing.…</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha was born on full moon night; he became enlightened on
full moon night – the same full moon night, the same month. And he died
on the same full moon night, the same month. He must have been really in
deep communication with the moon. It is not visible; everything need not
be visible.</p><p><br></p><p>We are connected with the whole universe. The moment your ego
disappears, this connection with the whole becomes absolutely certain.
There is no need to worship – you are then worshipping yourself. There
is no need to pray. To whom are you praying? Then what is left for you
is to rejoice, to enjoy all the gifts of existence. They are your
inheritance! They belong to you, you belong to them.</p><p>There will be a totally different humanity if all the egos disappear.
This whole earth will become a disco – Zorba the Buddha. People will be
dancing, singing, enjoying. And there is so much to enjoy that who
bothers about having a big post in the government? A few idiots may do
that, but nobody will be jealous of them. And if you are not jealous of
them, their joy at holding the big post of the president or the prime
minister will be finished. Nobody cares! Ronald Reagan passes by and you
don’t even say “Hi.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later those idiots will also come to their senses. What has
happened? Nobody is recognizing them, nobody is bothering who they are.
And everybody is so blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego disappearing, God disappears. Ego disappearing, hope disappears,
despair disappears. Ego disappearing, there is no hell, no heaven. Ego
disappearing, you become part of the universe, as you really are.</p><p>To me, this is enlightenment, this is liberation. Nobody can do it on
your behalf. That’s why I say people like Jesus are talking nonsense –
that they have come to save others, they are saviors. And it is not only
Jesus, all the religions have their own buffoons.</p><p>Nobody can do it for you, you will have to do it for yourself, you
will have to take the responsibility. Whatever the society has forcibly
implanted in you, you have to undo it.</p><p>Silence does the miracle. That’s why I say, yes, absolutely yes: your
ego and God are not separate. God is the ego of the whole; your ego is
the ego of the part. And the vested interests would like you to continue
carrying the ego, because if the ego disappears, God disappears. All
churches, all temples, mosques, gurudwaras, will have to be turned into
discos where people come to dance and sing and play. That will be true
religion.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY IS IT THAT WE WANT APPROVAL?</p><p>It is simple. from the very beginning a child is told what is right,
what is wrong. He is never given freedom to choose on his own. He is
taught principles; he is not allowed to enquire and to find out himself.
And of course, whenever he does anything on his own, he is disapproved
of by the family, by the society, by the school, by everybody. He
becomes shaky. Just to do anything on your own is not accepted by the
society. You need approval for everything.</p><p>When I was a small child, as far back as I can remember, I could not
understand it. I said, “It is my</p><p>life, I am going to live it. You have lived your life. Why should you
impose things upon me?”</p><p><br></p><p>There used to be an annual fair a few miles away from my town. I went
there without asking my family. For three days I enjoyed the place. It
was by the side of a very big and beautiful river, and there were so
many magicians and dancers and dramas Those three days just passed so
quickly.</p><p>When I came back home, everybody was angry. My father asked me, “If
you wanted to go to the fair, why didn’t you ask?”</p><p>I said, “Because I wanted to go. If you are honest enough, tell me:
if I had asked would you have said yes? Just be honest, at least once.”
And I looked into his eyes. For a moment there was silence. I said,
“Your silence has said much.”</p><p>He said, “Perhaps you are right; I would not have allowed you to go
there because there is gambling,</p><p>prostitutes, and all kinds of ugly things. I would not have allowed
you to go there.”</p><p>So I said, “Things are clear. I wanted to go – that’s why I did not
ask. And from now on,” I told him, “remember, whatever I want to do I
will not ask you. Whatever I don’t want to do, perhaps I may ask you,
because I am always contrary.”</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to cross the river – in the rainy season it becomes so big,
it is a mountainous river. In summer it shrinks and becomes small. In
rainy seasons, suddenly it becomes vast.</p><p>I wanted to swim. I went – it was risky. When I came back home...
because it took me six hours to go to the other side. You cannot swim
straight in a mountainous river; the water is going down so forcefully
that you can reach to the other shore only three, four miles down. Then
four miles you have to walk – not four miles, you have to walk eight
miles. And then again you can swim back to the place from where you had
started. They thought I must have drowned because by the time I reached
home they were all searching with boats, looking for my dead body.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We could not believe that you would do it. You should
have asked!”</p><p>I said, “I wanted to do it. Whether I die or remain alive does not
matter. Whatever I want to do, I am ready to pay for it; it is my
responsibility. I am not to be dominated, I am not a puppet.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had to struggle constantly with my family – and they were all
well-wishers. I had to fight constantly with my teachers, with my
professors, with my vice-chancellors – and they were all well-wishers.
Their intention was not bad, they wanted to help me. But to everybody I
made it absolutely clear all through my life that I didn’t want to be
helped, because that creates dependence.</p><p>One of my professors – he is now retired, so I can say the truth...
Professor S.S. Roy retired as head of the department of philosophy in
Allahabad University. He was my professor, and he was very much
concerned; he loved me, he wanted me to become somebody. And I told him,
“I am not going to become somebody, I don’t have that desire. I want to
become nobody.”</p><p>He said, “Don’t talk like that. The examinations are coming, and I
know you don’t have any textbooks.”</p><p><br></p><p>I never purchased any textbooks. I purchased thousands of books – in
my library when I left India, there were one hundred fifty thousand
books of rare value – but I never purchased a single textbook.</p><p>He knew it. Just when the examinations were to begin, he called me.
“Tomorrow morning,” he said, “your examinations are to begin, and this
is the questionnaire that you have to answer. So please sit with me and
answer me, because I want to know I have set these questions, this paper
has been</p><p>made by me, so you answer me, one by one, so that I am certain that
you will not fail – at least in</p><p>my paper. It will be a shame if you fail in my paper.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried.” I took that questionnaire and just
threw it out the window, tearing it into</p><p>pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am going to answer the questions. Whether I pass or fail
does not matter. What matters is that I do not want to be dependent –
that will keep me burdened my whole life. You love me, I can understand
it, but your love is not very much if it cannot understand what I have
done. I have</p><p><br></p><p>not seen those questions; I want to see them tomorrow morning in the
examination hall. And finally</p><p>those copies will be coming to you; then you can see my answers.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I gave you the whole paper – which is illegal, criminal; I
risked my prestige for you. But I should have known before, because I
know the type of a person you are. I can understand,” he said, “you
don’t want to be obliged.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true. Neither do I want to be obliged, nor do I want
to oblige anybody else in the world. Everybody should be on his own,
choose his way. I would rather go to hell, but not losing my freedom,
than to heaven, being directed by somebody else.”</p><p>You are asking why we go on seeking the approval of others. It is
because you are uncertain of yourself. You have been brought up in such
a way that uncertainty has become your very second nature. Somebody with
authority, power, prestige, approves of you, then you feel good, then
you know that you must be right. You cannot decide on your own, because
from the very childhood whatever you did on your own was found wrong and
you were punished for it. That child is still there; just your body has
grown. But your mind is somewhere in your childhood, still seeking
approval.</p><p><br></p><p>Someday you have to stop it. The day you stop it, you start growing.
If you don’t stop it you will remain a child even when you are dying – a
hundred years old and you will still be a child. Even while dying you
will need approval.</p><p><br></p><p>At the death moment, when it is coming close, immediately the priest
is called, the bishop comes, the maulvi is called, the pundit comes; and
they start giving you great advice for the future life. They won’t allow
you even to die freely. They have not allowed you in your life to live
freely, how can they allow you to die freely?</p><p>In fact, you also would not like to die freely, because you don’t
know; now you are entering into an unknown dimension. You need someone
who knows, who can give you courage, who can say, “Don’t be worried,
only the body dies; your soul will still remain.” If you are a Hindu the
advice will be different, but the basic thing is the same – that you
cannot die in freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it happens, a person suddenly dies. The person is dead; by
sheer accident he died in freedom without any priest around. But these
priests of all the religions are really the jailers of your
consciousness. The person has died but the ritual will be done. If you
are Hindu, the mantras of the VEDAS will be recited – and the man is no
more! Water from the holy Ganges will be poured in the mouth of the
corpse, because Hindus believe that the water of the holy Ganges takes
you into heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>They have this fiction that the Ganges is really a river of heaven.
One great ascetic, Baghirath, prayed to God, did all kinds of
austerities possible, tortured himself as much you can imagine, and
prayed, “I will continue my austerities until you send the Ganges to the
earth.” And he succeeded: the Ganges came down from heaven to the earth.
That’s why its water is heavenly, it is pure.</p><p>If you drink it before death it will take you to heaven. So in every
Hindu family they preserve the Ganges water. Who knows? – any time
somebody can die. It is good if he drinks it before he dies. If by
accident he misses, then no harm – you can drop a little water into his
mouth, hoping that he will go to heaven. Even after death you are not
going to allow freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom comes as a by-product of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you start knowing your inner being, you have then the insight of
what has to be done and what has not to be done. And it comes from your
own still, small voice. It can be heard only in silence. For the first
time you start moving in freedom, living in freedom. And remember, the
slave – particularly the psychological slave – cannot know of any
rejoicing, any blessing. He wants approval. Approval of whom?</p><p><br></p><p>I asked my father, my teachers, my professors, “Are you certain what
you are saying is right?” – because in the world there are so many
cultures, so many religions, and they are all certain and they are all
contradicting each other. They cannot all be true. They all can be
false, but they cannot all be true. And how to decide who is right?
Perhaps one is right, but how to decide?”</p><p>And I have never received an answer that satisfied me. Then I told
them, “Then let me alone. You yourself are uncertain. You start quoting
the VEDAS, THE BIBLE, the KORAN; you are seeking approval. But what are
the grounds for the certainty that Mohammed was not mad?”</p><p>A very simple person can see that these things that Mohammed is
saying cannot be right. Mohammed says every man can have four wives.
Now, in the world there are not four times more women than men, they are
equal. Nature keeps the balance. If one man marries four wives, he takes
away three men’s right to be married. Now three persons have to remain
celibate their whole life; they have been forced to remain celibate.
They are bound to become perverts; they will find some way to express
their sexuality. I don’t see that Mohammed is saying anything which
makes sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus say that when the husband dies, the wife has to jump into the
funeral pyre of her husband; then only does she prove that she was
sincere towards her husband. For thousands of years, millions of women
had to jump alive into the funeral pyre of a husband who had done
nothing except beat them and make them pregnant continuously. And they
were treated just like cattle.</p><p><br></p><p>She should rejoice that that dodo is dead. On the contrary, she is
forced.… And they had made arrangements, because alive... just think of
yourself jumping into the fire – you will try to come out of it. So
there were brahmin priests around the fire with burning torches to push
her back. And so much purified butter was poured into the funeral pyre
that there was smoke surrounding the whole area, so nobody could see
what the priests were doing.</p><p>In the second circle, there was another group of priests who were
chanting the VEDAS so loudly that the poor woman’s screams would be
lost. Yes, you can find the authority for this in the Hindu scriptures,
but the very thing is ugly, inhuman. And whoever has written that was
not a man of sanity. He was a male chauvinist; he was not interested in
human values.</p><p>If the woman refused... and a few women were courageous enough to
refuse, they didn’t want to die. Yes, they loved their husband, but that
does not mean that they had to die with the husband. They loved him, but
they were not going to commit suicide. These women were treated very
badly. They could not marry again. Manu, the greatest Hindu authority on
all kinds of things, says they cannot marry again.</p><p><br></p><p>Strange – a man can marry again, and a man is not asked to jump into
the funeral pyre of his wife. Anybody can see the point, that this is
simply fascist on the part of men. This Manu is not a man of truth, a
man of silence, a man of wisdom. You will be surprised, Manu’s book is
five thousand years old. Even Hindus who believe in it feel a little bit
ashamed because there are many things in it which make them feel
ashamed.</p><p>But Friedrich Nietzsche – who was the philosophical source of Adolf
Hitler’s fascism – respects Manu as he respects nobody else. Adolf
Hitler declared Manu one of the most significant authorities as far as
morality is concerned. And these are not Hindus. You can see the
relationship: these are fascists, and Manu approves of all kinds of
fascism.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu widow remains alive in a very ugly way – if she chooses to
remain alive. Her hair is cut so that she does not look beautiful. She
cannot use any ornaments, because the man for whom she was supposed to
look beautiful is dead. She cannot use any colored clothes, only white.
All her hair, which is one of the most beautiful parts of a woman – is
shaved. That hair gives a certain individuality to each woman.</p><p><br></p><p>She cannot use any cosmetics, she cannot use any ornaments. Even the
cheapest glass bangles have to be broken. She has to hit her hands on
the earth, on the wall, on the stone, to break the glass bangles. It
brings blood to her hands. She cannot go in any place where celebration
is happening. She cannot participate in any marriage, she cannot
participate in any festival. She has to remain isolated, and she has to
be treated just like a servant.</p><p>She does all kinds of things like a servant – utterly degraded,
deprived of her humanity. You cannot see such humiliation anywhere. It
would have been far better to have jumped into the fire – within minutes
things would have ended. Now this woman has to suffer perhaps fifty
years, sixty years. She will be just a living corpse.</p><p>If you ask the professor, as I used to ask, “What do you say?” –
because Hindus believe Manu is a Maharishi, a great seer. And I say, “he
must be the greatest blind man ever! Seer, my foot! This is the law that
he has given to the Hindus. You go on finding approval in scriptures –
and you don’t know who wrote those scriptures, what kind of people they
were.”</p><p>Neither any man can be the source of approval, nor can any scripture
be the source of approval. You have to listen to your own inner voice,
and move accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the way of the sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s14>19</span></p><p><br></p><p>Deeper and deeper into the mysterious, the miraculous</p><p><br></p><p>17 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>OUTSIDE, THEN INSIDE – BEAUTY, UTTER BEAUTY. IS THERE MORE?</p><p>There is no end to it. There is infinitely more. You cannot exhaust
it.</p><p>But one condition has to be remembered: You should not ask for it.
You should not see it, because it comes on its own. It is not a desire
from your side. Desire kills it. It is the abundance of existence that
simply goes on flowering towards you if you are available.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remain available, and there will be more and more and more. But
from your mind, the idea of getting more has to be dropped entirely. The
moment you ask for more there will be less. If you become too ambitious,
there is every possibility you will lose it completely.</p><p>So it is a slightly delicate matter. You keep your doors and windows
open and enjoy whatsoever happens. And so much happens that you cannot
conceive more is possible, but when more happens you will be surprised.
And this more goes on happening. BUt remember the word “happening.” It
is nothing like an effort, a plan, a project on your part. You have to
be just an empty receiver.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as water flows downwards towards the ocean, beauty, truth, love
– all that is valuable in existence – flows towards a person who is
nobody.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I WISH THERE WAS ONLY YOU AND NO COMMUNE. I FEEL WINGS WHEN I SEE
YOU, BUT AGGRESSIVE AND HELPLESS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNE. AND
THIS MAKES ME FEEL UNHAPPY AND ASHAMED. EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS SO CLEAR
TO ME, AND YET I HAVE THE FEELING THAT I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL.
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME?</p><p>Much is the matter with you.</p><p><br></p><p>There are half a million sannyasins around the world. Everybody wants
the same thing you are asking, that he should possess me totally, that
there should be nobody else who shares me. But please, think of me too.
Just you and me Are you bent upon boring me to death? And remember,</p><p>this is the desire of every sannyasin. You have to understand it. Why
this fear and helplessness with the commune?</p><p>The commune is nothing but my expanded being. If you really love me,
you will automatically love the commune. If you are feeling beautiful
winds blowing when I am with you, then in the commune you will feel even
more, because I am there in many forms. I have lost my personality
completely. I am just an opening. Whoever enters into me also becomes
part of the infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are somehow fearful and detest the commune, that simply means
you have not yet come close to me – not at all. You say you feel you
understand me clearly, every word that I utter, you understand it, and
yet you have the feeling that you don’t understand me at all. Your
second part is right, you don’t understand me at all. You only
understand the words that I speak. And the words that I speak are just
simple, ordinary, day-to-day use words. Anybody can understand those
words. I am not a scholar, I am not a theologian. I am not crazy enough
to be esoteric.</p><p><br></p><p>I am speaking to you – not even giving a discourse. It is just a
heart-to-heart talk. Words you understand – that gives you the
misconception. To understand my words is not the real thing. There is
something more between the words, between the lines, in the moments when
I suddenly pause in the middle of a sentence. If you understand those
pauses, those moments of silence, those gaps between two words, no
dictionary is needed. No dictionary can manage to explain those gaps,
those intervals.</p><p><br></p><p>That wordlessness is my real message.</p><p><br></p><p>I am using words only to create wordlessness as a contrast. Forget
everything that I have told you, but remember all those moments when I
was silent. It is a strange way of speaking – nobody speaks that way.
But when I stop, you are also in a stop waiting, awaiting what I am
going to say. Catch</p><p>those wordless moments. I am there, and you will find yourself also
there.</p><p><br></p><p>THE BIBLE says, “In the beginning there was the word.” This is sheer
stupidity. In the beginning – if there was any beginning – there was
wordlessness. THE BIBLE says, “And the word was with God.” What kind of
reasoning is this? First you say, “In the beginning there was only the
word.” Then from where does this God come? And THE BIBLE says not only
this, it says, “The word was with God and the word was God.” It is just
the opposite of reality.</p><p>In the beginning there was wordlessness – and there was no God with
wordlessness. And the question of God being one with wordlessness is
absolutely stupid, because “god” itself is a word and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>That silence was not only in the beginning; it is in the middle too,
it is in the end too. It is always. It surrounds you twenty-four hours a
day. But the difficulty is, not only a single word but millions of words
are with you. They make a very thick wall between you and existence. You
are encaged in words – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. The
sermons in the churches, in the synagogues, are just words.</p><p>I am not giving you a sermon, I am simply creating a device, using
two words to make you aware of the pause in between; only then will you
understand. And it is not a question of understanding me, understanding
is simply understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>When you bring a lighted torch into a dark room, it shows you the
whole room, all that is there: the paintings on the walls, the
furniture, the floor, the ceiling. Understanding is a quality in you. It
has not to be connected with me. It is not linear, it is
multidimensional. The moment you understand, the whole existence is an
open book for you. Then all the mystifications of the religions
disappear. Remember, I am saying “mystifications,” I am not saying the
“mysteries.”</p><p>In fact, when all the mystifications of the religions disappear and
you suddenly find yourself just in a moment of understanding, life is an
open book, but tremendously mysterious. When mystifications are no
longer there, then there is mystery. Then each moment of your life is a
mystery, and every moment of your life goes on leading you deeper and
deeper into the mysterious, the miraculous.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have committed a great crime against humanity. They
have tried to explain to you what is not explainable. In their effort to
explain to you the mystery of life, they have really explained it away.
By inventing a God they destroyed the mystery of creativity. They
created a God as creator; they continually conditioned you that
existence is the creation. But existence is not schizophrenic, it is not
split in two – the creator and the creation – it is simply
creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say to you that sometimes poets, singers, dancers, have come
very close to the mystery – but I don’t recall any saint, theologian,
philosopher having come close to the mystery of existence. In fact,
their whole attempt is to demystify existence. They are trying to put
before you a certain dogma which explains everything and leaves nothing
for you. Those are mere words, empty, ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want to give you words; you are already burdened too much. I
want to take all words from you. And I am using words for a very strange
reason – because if you have a thorn in your foot, you have to use
another thorn to take it out. I am destroying your words by my words,
and giving you a chance continuously to listen to the pauses, the silent
moments.</p><p><br></p><p>You are right that you feel you understand my words – anybody can do
that. I don’t use big words, I don’t use any jargon. And you are also
right that the feeling arises that you don’t understand me at all. You
will have to choose. Either you go on understanding my words and become
a great pundit, a scholar... and a scholar is farthest away from
existence. You may become very knowledgeable, but your knowledge is just
an effort to cover up your ignorance.</p><p>But if you choose the silent periods, then suddenly all the mysteries
of life become available to you – not as explanations; you don’t get
reality as an answer, you get it as an experience. And with that mystery
you also become a mystery.</p><p>This is not ignorance, this is innocence. You become the child.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND I FEEL REALLY
ATTRACTED TO DEATH. THIS DISTURBS ME, BUT AT THE SAME TIME GIVES ME JOY.
WILL YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT?</p><p>This is great! One can commit suicide only once, and you have
attempted many times – and you are still alive. Those attempts were not
true, they were all bogus, and you knew it even then.</p><p>I have heard.… Mulla Nasruddin wanted to commit suicide. Being a man
of great cleverness, he made all the arrangements, left no loopholes.
Perhaps nobody else had attempted suicide in that way.</p><p>He went on top of a hill, taking a pistol with him. Just underneath
the hill, deep down, was a river, very dangerous, deep, and surrounded
by all kinds of rocks. On the hill there was a tree – he had also
brought a rope. Not to take any chances, he figured out all the possible
things so that suicide was absolutely certain. He also carried with him
a big container full of kerosene oil.</p><p>He hanged himself from the tree, but because he was going to do many
more things, he could not take his feet from the earth – because then
how was he going to do other things? So he was hanging from the tree and
standing on the earth. Then he poured kerosene oil over himself; he had
brought a lighter too. He created a fire, the kerosene oil was burning
all around him. But he was not a man to take any chances, so he also
shot a bullet into his head. But the bullet cut the rope, he fell down
into the river, and the river water destroyed the fire!</p><p>Desperately, he was coming back home when I met him. I asked, “You
are still alive after all that arrangement?”</p><p>He said, “What to do? I know how to swim!” Everything failed!</p><p>You say you have attempted suicide many times. One thing is certain:
you don’t want to commit suicide, you want to play with the idea. And
you feel also that there is fear about death and there is also a certain
joy. This is not only your situation. It is a very common human
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a torture, a burden; it is anguish. One wants to get rid of
it. To get rid of it means getting rid of all the anguish, the despair,
the hopelessness, the meaninglessness – this wife, this husband, these
kids, this job. Hence there is an attraction towards death, because
death will put an end to all your misery. But it will also put an end to
you – that creates fear.</p><p>You really want to live, and live forever, but you want to live in
paradise. And you are living in a hell! You want to get rid of the hell,
you don’t want to get rid of yourself. And I want to emphasize that you
are your own hell. So suicide is attractive from one side in that it
will put an end to all your miseries, but on the other hand there is a
great fear: it will finish you too.</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t there some way that the miseries can be finished and you can
live more intensely?</p><p><br></p><p>I also teach you that a certain suicide can help you – the suicide of
the ego, not of you. Let the ego die, and then see that with it all
problems disappear. You are left full of joy, blessedness, and each
moment goes on opening new doors to new mysteries. Each moment becomes a
moment of discovery – and it is an unending process.</p><p><br></p><p>You have attempted so many times to commit suicide. This time you
commit suicide my style. And anyway, you have failed so much that you
must have become very much of an expert in failing. And deep down you
don’t want to die because you are afraid of death – which is natural.
Why should one put an end to one’s life when life has not even been
lived? You have not even tasted it, you have not explored the
multidimensional beauties, joys and blessings of life.</p><p>Naturally you are afraid. But still you go on attempting it, because
you don’t know how to get rid of all the miseries. Suicide seems to be
the simplest way. You are in a split: half of your mind says, “Commit
suicide and be finished with all this nonsense – enough is enough.” The
other part tries to sabotage your effort, because the other part wants
to live. You have not lived yet.</p><p>Suicide is not going to help. Only more life, more abundant life, is
going to help. So this time kill the ego, and see the miracle happen.
With the ego gone, there is no misery, no anguish, and no need to commit
suicide. With the ego gone, all the doors that were closed by the ego
suddenly open and you are available to the sun, to the moon, to the
stars.</p><p>And it is easier, because to kill the ego you don’t need a pistol,
kerosene oil, a rope to hang the ego, fire to burn the ego, and if
everything fails, then a deep mountainous river underneath to finish the
ego. You don’t need any of these things, because the ego is only a
creation of the society, of the religions, of the culture. It does not
exist in fact. You have only to look deeply into it; it is a shadow. You
have to look into it, and it is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is simply a method of looking into what this ego is. And
whoever has ever looked in has not found it. Without any exception,
throughout the history of man, whoever has looked inwards has not come
across any ego.</p><p>This is the suicide of the ego. Nothing has to be done, just a little
turning in. And once you know it is not there, then all the sufferings
that you were carrying because of a non-existential ego disappear. They
cannot have any nourishment anymore. All these things have been created
in your mind by conditioning, by programming; that’s what the society
has done to you. We have lived the whole of history in an ugly way.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my professors did not agree with me, that something can be
created by other people when it is</p><p>not there at all. So I said, “I will show it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was very much loved by the man; his wife was also very loving
towards me. I went to his wife and told her, “Tomorrow morning when the
professor gets up, you have to pretend that you are shocked, and say to
him, ‘What has happened to you? When you went to bed you were perfectly
okay; now your face is looking pale. Are you sick or something?’”</p><p><br></p><p>The next morning the professor simply denied it. He said, “What
nonsense are you talking? I am perfectly okay.”</p><p>I had told his gardener, “When he comes into the garden, you simply
say, ‘My God! What has happened to you? You cannot walk, you are
wobbling. Something is wrong with you. Just go inside and rest and I
will go and call the doctor.’”</p><p><br></p><p>And I had said to both these people, “Whatsoever he says, exactly in
his own words, you write it</p><p>down. I will collect those notes.”</p><p><br></p><p>To the gardener he said, “Yes, it seems something is wrong. Perhaps I
should rest, I should not go to the university. But I don’t see any need
to call the doctor.” He was perfectly healthy and there was no problem,
so finally he decided that at least for half an hour or an hour he would
go to the university.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way I had said to many people whom I trusted On the way there
was the postmaster. I told</p><p>him, “Even if you are busy, don’t miss: when the professor passes by
you shout at him, ‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Are you mad?
Your body is absolutely sick! You come into my house, rest. I will call
the doctor.’” I collected all these notes. The professor said, “Yes,
since last night I have this feeling that something is going wrong. I am
not exactly sure what is going wrong, but something is wrong. I feel a
certain trembling inside, a fear, as if I am not going to last
long.”</p><p><br></p><p>His house and the university philosophy department were almost one
mile apart, and he had always walked – but that day, in the middle, he
stopped another professor’s car and told him, “I don’t think I will be
able to reach the university department.”</p><p>The university was on a hilly place, up and down. From his house it
was an uphill task to reach the department; the department was on the
top of the hill and his house was in the valley.</p><p>He said, “I am huffing, huffing<span class=s6></span>my body is
trembling. I think there is fever, and there is much more</p><p>which I cannot figure out.” So he wanted a lift.</p><p><br></p><p>And the professor who had passed him was sent by me: “Just when he is
in a very bad situation, you stop your car and ask, ‘What is the
matter?’” In the car he said, “You should not have come, you should have
called the doctor. Your eyes look as if they have lost all luster. Your
face looks dry, faded; you look like a faded painting. Just in one
night! Had you a heart attack in the night? It must have been
serious.”</p><p>And he said, “It seems that I had a heart attack and I was not aware
because I was asleep, but now I</p><p>know. All the symptoms are showing that my life is at the very
end.”</p><p>When he entered the university department, the peon who used to sit
in front of the department I</p><p>had told him, “When he comes, you simply jump and hold him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But he will be very angry. And what kind of thing are you
asking? You have never asked anything before.”</p><p>I said, “We are doing an experiment – me and the professor. Don’t
interfere, you simply do what I say. You just hold him and tell him,
‘You are going to fall.’” He did that and the professor thanked him. And
the peon had no need to tell him that he was going to fall; the
professor said himself, “If you had not been here I would have
fallen.”</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the department I was waiting for him. I said, “Jesus! You look
like a ghost! What calamity has happened to you?” I took hold of him,
put him in a reclining chair.</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “Just one thing I want to tell you. My children are
small” – he had only two children – “my wife is young, inexperienced. I
don’t have any family; my father is dead, my mother is dead. I don’t
know anybody who can take care of them when I am gone. I can think only
of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried. I will take care of your children,
your wife – better than you are doing.</p><p>But before you decide to leave the world, I have to show you a few
notes.” He said, “A few<span class=s6></span>what notes?”</p><p>I said, “I will have to go and collect them.” He said, “From
whom?”</p><p>I said “From your wife, from the gardener, from the postmaster, from
the professor who drove you</p><p>here, from the peon who saved you from falling.” He said, “But how do
you know?”</p><p>I said, “It was all planned. And you say that man cannot be deceived
by something nonexistential?”</p><p><br></p><p>I went down, collected all the notes, and I showed him them one by
one. And I said, “Look how you are getting caught up. To your wife you
absolutely denied there was anything wrong. To the gardener you said
‘Perhaps something is wrong.’ But it was”perhaps,” you were not certain
yet. But the idea was getting in. To the postmaster you said, ‘Yes,
something must have happened. From the very evening I was feeling bad,
sick, apprehensive.’</p><p>“With the professor in the car you accepted that you must have had a
heart attack while you were asleep. You were feeling so weak” – and he
was a strong man – “that you could not conceive yourself walking uphill
to the department. And to the peon who jumped and took hold of you, you
said, ‘I am grateful to you. I was just going to fail, to collapse.’ Now
this is a simple idea,” I told him, “that has been implanted in
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now do you see the point? This man can even die, you just have to
keep on going. I was only proving a point on which he was not agreeing,
so this was only an argument – I did not want him to</p><p><br></p><p>die. Otherwise, I would have talked to the doctor and had him say to
him, “Your days are finished, so whatever you want to do – write your
will or anything – do it quickly. It is not something that I can help
with, your heart is simply finished; any moment it is going to stop.” I
could have killed that man just by an idea.</p><p>Seeing the notes, immediately he was back, perfectly healthy. He
walked down the hill laughing, and told the peon, “You should not listen
to this man, he is dangerous. He almost killed me!” He told the other
professor, “This is not right, that you suggested to me that I must have
had a heart attack.” He told the postmaster, “You are my neighbor, and
is this right, to push me towards death?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very angry with his wife. He said, “I can think that he
persuaded other people – he has everybody impressed by him – but I
cannot believe that my own wife deceived me, listened to him. We were in
an argument; it was a question of my prestige, and you destroyed it!”
But the wife said, “You should be grateful to him. He has given proof
that man can be programmed for something which does not exist at
all.”</p><p>You think you are a Christian? It is just an idea implanted in you.
Do you think there is a God? An idea implanted in you. Do you think
there is a heaven and hell? It is nothing but programming. You are all
programmed.</p><p><br></p><p>My work with you is to deprogram you. And I am showing you all the
notes – day after day, continuously – that these are the things that
have made you almost dull, stupid, even attracted towards suicide,
towards death. My religion is unique in this way: all the religions of
the past have programmed people; I deprogram you, and then I leave you
alone, to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>People have been asking me, “What is your religion? What is your
philosophy? Can’t you give us something like a Christian catechism so we
can understand that these are your principles?”</p><p>I have none, because that will be programming you again. When a Hindu
becomes a Christian, what happens? The Christians deprogram him as a
Hindu, and reprogram him as a Christian. There is no difference. From
one ditch he has fallen into another ditch. Perhaps the newness of it
may keep him happy for a few days, but soon he will start looking for
another ditch. Now he is addicted to ditches! And in this way he is
simply digging his own grave. That is the final ditch into which he will
fall.</p><p><br></p><p>I deprogram you, and I don’t give you any other program. I leave you
alone, empty, just a zero. In</p><p>that zero, the ego disappears and all the blessings start showering
on you. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SOMETIMES DURING DISCOURSE MY VISION BECOMES UNFOCUSED. I SEE YOU
CHANGE: WITH OTHER FACES, OTHER CLOTHES, AND OTHER BODILY GESTURES. IT’S
A STRANGE FEELING. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?</p><p><br></p><p>It is nothing. It is not a strange phenomenon, it is just the
Oregonian sun and its heat.</p><p><br></p><p>You should simply go to Pythagoras – you need medical treatment. And
of course, I am not a medicine man. First, get medical treatment, and
when you start seeing me the way everybody else is seeing me, then if
you have any question I can help.</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DO YOU SEE EXPERIMENTS ON HUMAN LIFE, SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL BIRTH AND
THE EXCHANGE OF HEARTS AND BRAINS, AS AN ADVANCE, OR AS AN ACTION
AGAINST NATURE?</p><p><br></p><p>It all depends who is going to do it. If the politicians are going to
do it, or the so-called religions are going to do it, then it is against
nature. They cannot do anything natural, they are against nature. But if
it is being done by an international academy of scientists – I say
International academy of scientists – it can be a tremendous,
progressive step, and it will not be against nature. It will be nature’s
growth.</p><p>But it all depends on who is doing it. The experiments themselves are
neutral. No experiment has any vested interest, it is neutral. You can
use poison to kill you; the same poison can be used by medical people to
save you. It all depends who is doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the discovery of atomic energy was a step of
tremendously great progress, a quantum leap. We had found a key to
transform the earth into paradise – so much energy in such a small atom.
And they are in everything... just in a dewdrop there are millions of
atoms. Any atom, if it is exploded, releases so much energy that you can
make the whole earth live in luxury. Or you can create Hiroshima and
Nagasaki – thousands of people dead within seconds.</p><p>But because atomic energy, after its invention, went into the hands
of the politicians, it became a servant of death. Now there are even
more advanced nuclear weapons which can destroy the whole earth. The
already existing weapons are enough to destroy this earth seven times.
One simply wonders why nations are going to develop more and more
nuclear power. Seven times destroying the earth is not enough? In fact,
you can destroy the earth only once.</p><p><br></p><p>But scientific progress falls into the hands of the politicians
because only they can provide enough finance to make these discoveries
possible. The scientists of the whole world should think it over: their
genius is being used by idiots! The scientists should disconnect
themselves from any nation – whether it is the Soviet Union or America.
They should create an international academy of sciences. And it is not
difficult. If all the scientists of the world are together, finances can
be made available, and these discoveries can help man tremendously.</p><p>The international academy of scientists can be in this international
city. We can give them land, and every possible support. But they should
be the decisive factors in what is going to happen through their
experiments. And it is time the scientists should recognize their great
responsibility. If a third world war happens then the scientists will be
the greatest criminals, because they supplied all kinds of inventions to
the politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Science should not be the monopoly of any nation, any country. The
whole idea is stupid. How can science be monopolized? And every country
is trying to monopolize the scientists, keep their inventions secret.
This is against humanity, against nature, against existence. Whatever a
genius discovers should be in the service of the whole.</p><p>You are asking whether discoveries like changing human hearts or
human brains are progressive steps. They are of great importance to
bring a new humanity on the earth. If Einstein’s body is no longer
capable of living, do you think it would not be good if his whole brain
is transplanted into a young, healthy man? The new man will become an
Einstein, because all the genius of Einstein is transplanted to a
younger body.</p><p>This way bodies may go on changing, but we can keep the genius of
Albert Einstein growing for centuries. And if a man in a seventy-year
life can give so much, you can imagine if his brain continues for
centuries how much benefit it will be for humanity, for the whole
universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This is really a wastage: the container gets rotten, and you throw
the content also. The body is only a container. If the container has
become dirty, old, unusable, change the container, but don’t throw away
the content. The genius mind can live for eternity in different bodies;
that is nothing against nature.</p><p><br></p><p>You heart, if it starts failing, and if you are of immense value to
humanity... what is the fear of exchanging the heart? Somebody may be
dying from cancer, but his heart is perfectly healthy; that heart can be
planted in a man who is talented, a genius, and is healthy, but whose
heart is not strong. This is simple; there is nothing in it against
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>But with politicians and the power in their hands, of course every
advance has gone against nature. Everything that human genius has
discovered, invented, finally is in the service of death. So are the
priests. Now science is no longer a child, that it has to depend on
others. Science is now grown-up enough, it is adult. Just a little
courage.…</p><p><br></p><p>I give the invitation to all the scientists of the world; we have the
place, we have intelligent people here to help you in every possible
way. And if you want to make an international academy here, we are
capable of managing finances for you.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be a great revolution in the history of man. The whole power
will be in the hands of the scientists, who have never done any harm to
anybody. And once all the power is in the hands of the scientists,
politicians will fade away of their own accord. They have been
exploiting scientists for their own purposes, and to be exploited by
anybody is not an act of dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientists should recognize their dignity, they should recognize
their individuality. They should recognize that they have been exploited
down the ages by the priests and the politicians. Now it is time to
declare that science is going to stand on its own feet. This will be a
great freedom.</p><p>Then all these experiments, such as laboratory babies, will be of a
different caliber, because you can arrange what kind of genius you want.
Up to now it has been just accidental, and because it has been
accidental, ninety-nine percent of the people have nothing to
contribute. They contribute only problems to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what has Ethiopia contributed to the world? What have the poor
countries contributed to the world – or even the rich countries? Except
problems, wars, there is no contribution on their part.</p><p>But if you can give birth to a child in a scientific lab It is
possible, there is no problem in it. The male</p><p>semen and the woman’s egg can meet in a tube. There is no need to go
on in the old bullock cart way. We can look and we can have the whole
picture of what this child is going to be. If we want more poets, we can
create more poets. If we want more musicians, we can create more
musicians. And we can create only geniuses; there is no need for
mediocre people – they have had their day.</p><p>We can give the child strength, long life. We can make sure that he
never becomes sick, that he will never becomes old. It is just a
question of managing and finding the right egg and the right male
contribution to the egg. What we have been doing is just utterly
unintelligent.</p><p>And this will free man also from guilt, possessiveness, jealousy,
because you will not be producing children. Sex, for the first time,
will be simply fun! Children will be produced in the lab. They will
belong to all. And because you are not going to produce children in the
old way – it should be illegal and criminal to do so, you will be behind
bars if you do it – then many problems of your life will be simply
dissolved.</p><p>Why is the man so insistent ? Throughout the ages the insistence has
remained there: he wants to</p><p>be certain that the child born out of his wife’s womb is his. Why?
Who are you anyway? It is a question of property, because your child
will become the inheritor of all that you have accumulated. You want to
be certain that it is your child, not your neighbor’s child.</p><p>Women have been kept almost imprisoned, for the simple fear that if
they start mixing with people it will be difficult to decide whose child
it is. Only the mother will know, or even she may not know.</p><p>Once production of life goes into the hands of science, sex will be
transformed. Then you are not jealous, then you are not a monopolist,
then monogamy is absurd. Then sex is just fun, the way you enjoy tennis.
And you don’t bother that the partners should remain monogamous – two
bodies enjoying each other.… And there will be no fear that the wife may
get pregnant and there will be problems, financial and other.</p><p>Sex will no longer be a problem for the world population; it will no
longer be a problem for the priest. In fact, if children are produced in
the scientific lab, many of the troubles of the world will dissolve. And
we can create the best people: beautiful, healthy, capable of living as
long as we want. Old age is not necessary – a man can remain young,
healthy, without sickness.</p><p>All these hospitals and so many people, so much money involved Do you
know? America spends</p><p>more money on laxatives than on education. Great idea! Who cares
about education? The question is laxatives!</p><p>But the basic thing should be remembered. Scientists have to be
courageous enough and declare that they don’t belong to any nation, to
any religion, that whatsoever they will be doing will be for the whole
humanity. And I don’t see that there is anything impossible in it.</p><p>I am absolutely for those progressive inventions which can make man
happier, live longer, be younger, healthier, and which make his life
more of a play, fun, and less of a torturous journey from the cradle to
the grave.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>20</span></p><p><br></p><p>Only an egoist can be humble</p><p><br></p><p>18 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IF YOU ARE ONLY A FALLIBLE, ORDINARY MAN, AND NOT A GREAT MASTER, WHY
ARE WE CALLED “THE CHOSEN FEW” WHO ARE GOING TO BE MESSENGERS OF
RAJNEESHISM FOR THE WORLD AT LARGE? DOESN’T THIS FULFILL OUR EGOS?</p><p><br></p><p>I have no ifs and buts in my philosophy of life. It is not a question
of “if.” I am not a great master but</p><p>an ordinary, fallible man – it is the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be chosen by an ordinary fallible man – I cannot conceive how
it can fulfill your ego. If you were chosen by a great master, then
certainly your egos would be fulfilled. But in your being chosen by an
ordinary, fallible man, your egos will be completely destroyed. The
fallible man will most probably choose the wrong person. The ordinary
man is bound to choose ordinary people. It is impossible for you to feel
extraordinary.</p><p>I want you to realize a simple thing: in existence there is nothing
higher, nothing lower. There are no separate entities to be compared –
it is one existence. And to be part of it you cannot remain
extraordinary. You are dividing yourself from the beautiful ordinariness
of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who have called themselves the great masters, prophets,
messiahs, are simply egoistic. Naturally, these people attracted other
egoistic people.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus declares he is the only begotten son of God. He chooses his
twelve apostles – all idiots, but their egos are tremendously fulfilled.
Chosen by the only begotten son of God, they become extraordinary in
their minds. The moment Jesus was departing, the last night, do you know
what the disciples were asking him? They were not concerned that
tomorrow he is going to be crucified, they did not ask a single question
about that. They did not ask, “What can we do to prevent it?” Not a
single one of them said, “I am ready to be crucified in your place.”</p><p><br></p><p>What they asked is simply disgusting. They asked, “Lord, when you
reach paradise, of course you will be sitting at the right hand of God
the father. Please tell us, what will be our positions? Who will be next
to you?”</p><p>Do you think these people are sane, sensible, reasonable? These
people are madly egoistic. They are with Jesus not because they love him
but because they are going to use Jesus as a ladder to reach paradise,
to the highest possible post there. Of course, they allow Jesus to be at
the right hand of God, but who will be next to him? – and then? – all
twelve apostles.… I do not see any love, any gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>They have not come for that. They were attracted by Jesus’
proclamation that he is the messenger, the prophet, the son. And a
fisherman is asking, “What will be my place in paradise?” A fisherman
has no place in this world. He is trying to console himself; he is
trying to believe that Jesus is the son of God, because on that belief
depends his ego. Without Jesus being the only begotten son of God, he is
only a fisherman. But if Jesus is the son of God, and the fisherman is
by his side, naturally he becomes extraordinary, the most superior
person possible. He has bypassed all the rabbis, all the saints, all the
prophets, all the priests. This is the inner functioning of their
mind.</p><p>You can be with me only if you don’t have such idiotic ideas about
yourself. To me, being a fisherman is far better than being a stupid
apostle. And who cares about God? He is not even a fisherman, he is not
even a carpenter – who cares to be on his right side or left side? In
the first place he does not exist, so there is no left, no right.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be with me for a simple reason only.</p><p><br></p><p>They were doing business. They were all Jews, and it was a good
bargain. Just to hang around this crazy man and then to gain all the
glories of heaven – it was a good bargain!</p><p><br></p><p>With me, you have only to lose; you cannot gain anything. You are in
a game where you can only be a loser. You will have to lose your ego,
you will have to lose your jealousy, you will have to lose your fear.
You will have to lose all kinds of crap that you are filled with. You
will have to be empty – and emptiness cannot claim the ego. There is no
place in emptiness, in nothingness, for the ego. You can be with me, not
for anything that is going to be profitable in the future; you can be
here only for this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not promise you anything. All your prophets and messiahs and
avataras have been lying – because all their promises are simple lies
and nothing else. They have been befooling you, cheating you, exploiting
you, knowing your weakness. This is your weakness: the ego. Anybody can
exploit you, he just has to make your ego a little bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, we have a proverb, “In time of need one has to call a
donkey ‘Daddy.’” Knowing perfectly well that he is a donkey, in time of
need you have to call him Daddy. Of course the donkey feels great. It is
a mutual phenomenon: you are calling him Daddy for your profit, and he
is readily available because nobody has ever called him Daddy. Everybody
has been, up to now, calling him donkey.</p><p>I was expelled from one of my colleges. I have been expelled many
times, but this time it was very difficult for me to get into another
college. The city I was living in had almost twenty colleges, but now
everybody was aware that it was better not to let me in, because I made
expulsion difficult, almost impossible. And the trouble was that I was
always right! All their expulsions were absolutely wrong, and they
accepted it.</p><p>The principles told me, “We are sorry, and we know that you are
right, but what can we do? It is difficult, we are in a great fix.”
Once, a professor who had been in the college for thirty years, one of
the most important professors of the college, known all over India, had
written a letter: “Either this student should not remain in the college,
or accept my resignation. We both cannot be in the college
together.”</p><p><br></p><p>The principal told me, “I know, I understand your argument. It is
absolutely valid” – because the professor was teaching logic and not
allowing me to argue!</p><p>“What kind of professor is he?” I asked him. “Particularly in the
subject of logic, argumentation is absolutely appropriate. He is not
teaching me love, he is teaching me logic. And if I find loopholes in
his logic, what is wrong in it? He should correct himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The principal said, “I understand. He is behaving arrogantly, knowing
that we cannot lose him. He is one of our best, most well-known
professors; he attracts students to the college. He knows that I can be
blackmailed, and he is blackmailing me; but I am sorry, I have to expel
you.”</p><p>No college was ready to accept me because the same was going to
happen everywhere; it had happened in a few other colleges before. But I
have my own way of doing things. I went to one principal who was thought
to be a crackpot. And why was he thought to be a crackpot? Because in
the early morning from five to seven he was praying to the mother
goddess Kali. He himself was a big man, black, ugly, and he was a
devotee of the mother Kali – kali means black. And the pictures or the
statues of mother Kali are really unbelievable. Who is going to worship
this woman?</p><p><br></p><p>She has in one of her hands a freshly-cut head of a man, blood
dripping, and in another hand, a sword ready for anybody she comes
across. And she is dancing on the chest of her husband! Twelve skulls of
human beings make her garland. She is ferocious, blood-thirsty. She
seems to be more representative of death than life.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a devotee of the goddess Kali and he got almost in a frenzy
When he prayed, he would</p><p>pray so loudly – and his voice was not musical. The whole
neighborhood was tortured. Nobody could sleep in the morning when it is
so beautiful to turn over and go to sleep again. You would go on tossing
and turning, and he would shout his prayers and dance.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached his home – I did not go to the college, to his office – I
reached his home at four o’clock early in the morning. He was just
coming out of his bathroom. He said, “Why have you come here?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I wanted to meet you in your temple, not in that ordinary
principal’s office. Here you are your reality. There you are nothing but
a principal. There are millions of principals in the country, but there
is not a single other devotee of your caliber. I wanted to meet you and
see you at your best.”</p><p>He smiled, he put his hand on my hand. He said, “You are the first
person to recognize me. Nobody recognizes what I am doing. All the
neighbors are against me, all the professors are against me, all the
students are against me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It will be a great privilege for me if I can sit and just
watch your devotion, your dance, your musical singing.” And that day he
did his best! After he was finished, I told him, “You have converted me:
I have become a devotee of the mother goddess Kali. Now I will see you
in the office.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “There is no need. I know you have been expelled – and a
person like you with such great insight! You need not bother; you are
admitted to the college. You need not apply for it. You are my most
respected student.”</p><p>And he kept his word: he permitted me in his college, he gave me a
scholarship. And whenever there was any occasion – and he used to find
occasions to torture the professors and the students by his long, boring
speeches – he would always mention me. He would say, “Perhaps nobody
else is understanding me, but I am certain that there is one person” –
and I was always sitting in front – “who understands me, and that is
enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot be close to me when I say I am an ordinary man. And it is
not “if.” Don’t try to deceive yourself, baby. I am really an ordinary
man. Unless you are also ordinary, there is no possibility of communion
between me and you. If you are extraordinary you will be so high, above
the roof of the Mandir. If you are also simple and ordinary, you will
understand the beauty, the grace, the innocence of it. Your ego will
disappear.</p><p>But because of your “if” the whole problem has arisen in your mind.
Deep down you want to believe that I am extraordinary. You may be
arguing within yourself that I am just being humble in saying that I am
ordinary. I am not a humble man. Only an egoist can be humble.
Humbleness is just the ego standing on its head. I don’t have any ego –
how can I be humble? There is no way.</p><p>You must be arguing within yourself that this is my way of teaching
you humility, simplicity, egolessness, but I am not ordinary. Please,
don’t deceive yourself. I am just as ordinary as you are, with all the
weaknesses, with all the frailties. This is to be emphasized
continuously because you will tend to forget it. And why am I
emphasizing it? So that you can see a very significant point: if an
ordinary man – who is just like you – can be enlightened, then there is
no problem for you either. You can also be enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions of the world have created a totally different
situation. Krishna, the Hindu god, is an incarnation of God himself. You
can listen to him, you can appreciate him, you can worship him, but you
cannot imagine that you can become another Krishna! He is not an
ordinary mortal, he comes from on high – you cannot even imagine the
height from where he comes. You are ordinary creatures of the earth. He
has come to give you a message, he has come to save you; he is your
savior.</p><p><br></p><p>You know yourself perfectly well – how can you imagine yourself a
savior? You know your weaknesses – you cannot drop smoking, how can you
be a savior?</p><p>If you want me to prove my ordinariness.… There are a few
difficulties; otherwise I would start smoking. It is just that I am
allergic. That means you are in a far better position than me. I cannot
smoke, I will immediately start coughing and will have an asthma attack.
You are in a far better position. I can start doing everything that you
do – I am just lazy. You have to tolerate me. But my point has to be
understood completely, without any ifs and buts.</p><p>I belong to you. I am part of you.</p><p>My place is amidst you.</p><p><br></p><p>That will destroy your egoistic trips and numbers. It will give you a
great rejoicing that one need not be an incarnation of God to be
enlightened; one need not be a special messenger of God, like Mohammed,
to be enlightened. One need not be in direct communication, with a
private line to God, and still you can be enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is the barrier. I am exposing my whole heart to you. I was
not born out of a virgin mother, I was born just as you were born. I was
not born while my mother was standing, she was lying down just as your
mother was lying down.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha was born, his mother was standing, and he dropped onto
the earth, standing. I have never done anything like that. Not only did
he drop from the womb standing, he walked seven feet, seven steps –
symbolic, esoteric. The number seven is very esoteric. And on his last
step, he stood there – just born, standing, walking – he stood there and
declared to the whole universe, “I am the most supreme enlightened
being!”</p><p>Now, I have not done anything like that. Even if I had been told to
do it, I would have refused. It looks so foolish. Now, how can you
imagine yourself walking side by side with Buddha? Impossible, he is
superhuman – you are an ordinary creature.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed died, but in a special way. He is no ordinary man, he is the
last prophet of God. After him there is not going to be any prophet. He
closed the door because he has given the final message. Now there are
going to be no further additions, impressions, no editing, nothing has
to be added. He has given the essential and basic and the most profound,
final message to the world. He cannot die in an ordinary way.</p><p>When he died, he flew with his horse upwards. People saw him going
beyond the clouds, and then he disappeared. Even the horse went with
him. It was no ordinary horse, it was Prophet Hazrat Mohammed’s horse.
You cannot even compare yourself with Mohammed’s horse – you are just a
donkey!</p><p>These people were pure egoists, creating stories about themselves,
and then their followers went on and on creating more and more stories
to make their prophet higher than other prophets. Over</p><p><br></p><p>the centuries, so many extraordinary miracles have accumulated around
these prophets – that impresses people. Becoming a Catholic, you become
special.</p><p>But to be with me you have to become ordinary, you have to come down
to the earth. You have to be human. And the moment you understand
humanity, its frailty, its weaknesses, you will understand other human
beings more clearly. You will not be so unkind if somebody commits a
mistake; you know it is human. If somebody goes wrong, you will not be
too hard. You will say, “So what? I am also prone to go that way.” If
somebody drinks alcohol, smokes cigars, plays cards.…</p><p>Prophets are not allowed to do such things. Prophets are not allowed
to do natural things even. Mahavira, the Jaina prophet, is not allowed
to perspire. I am very much worried about the man, because perspiration
is a natural device to keep your temperature exactly the same, normal.
If perspiration stops, Mahavira will explode into flames; his
temperature will go higher and higher.</p><p><br></p><p>Perspiration is a natural way to keep the heat from entering you. You
perspire, and the sunrays are prevented by your perspiration. The
sunrays become engaged – they are foolish – they become engaged in
evaporating the perspiration. They forget you, they leave you alone, and
your temperature remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>You have holes all over your body: seven million small holes, with
glands ready to perspire any moment. If Mahavira never perspired, I can
think only of one thing – that we should forget the idea that we have
invented plastic. Mahavira’s body must have been a plastic body; only a
plastic body cannot perspire.</p><p><br></p><p>Plastic is very stubborn. Now the scientists of the whole world are
worried: so much plastic is being thrown into the ocean, into the
rivers, into the earth, and there is no way for plastic to dissolve into
earth or into water. It is accumulating there because it is not a
natural product.</p><p>If a tree falls down, soon it will disappear into its basic elements:
the water will move into the water, the earth will move into the earth,
the air will be released into the air, and the tree will disappear. But
plastic is not going to disappear; it is going to remain there,
preventing natural cycles of rejuvenation. And each year there is more
and more plastic, because it is cheap. You need not keep it: you use the
content and throw the container; it has no value.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira’s body does not perspire. What about other things? He does
not urinate... because a man who does not perspire, do you think he will
urinate? What happens to the water that he drinks? His bladder must be
getting bigger and bigger and bigger – at bursting point. Any moment he
can create a flood! He does not defecate. Now, he must be unique, the
only person in the whole history – past, present, future – at the top of
the line of those who are constipated. You cannot defeat him.</p><p>One man has tried. The greatest length known to humanity is... one
man in England – of course, it has to be in England – remained
constipated for eight months. This is the longest period. Only an
Englishman can manage that. But what about Mahavira? – for eighty-two
years!</p><p><br></p><p>All this nonsense, all these lies are invented for a simple reason:
to humiliate you, to make you feel unworthy, to make you feel guilty, to
create an inferiority complex in you. And if an inferiority complex is
created in you, you start going towards something which is superior. You
want to become the</p><p><br></p><p>president of the country, you want to have all the wealth of the
world, you want in every direction and dimension to be something special
and higher. From inferiority to superiority is the journey of the
ego.</p><p>I want you to understand that you are perfectly okay as you are. Just
relax in your simple ordinariness. Don’t try to change it. Don’t try any
discipline to improve yourself. Just relax and accept.</p><p><br></p><p>If the sun accepts you.… Do you think presidents get more suntan than
you? Do you think trees look greener to the presidents than to you? Do
you think the world is in any way different to the kings and the queens
than to you? If this existence accepts you, then who is the priest to
condemn you? He is against nature, against existence. And because of his
continuous condemnation of your ordinariness, he goes on destroying
you.</p><p>I respect you, not because you don’t perspire. I respect you, not
because you were born of a virgin girl. I respect you, not because you
were born standing, walked seven steps and declared, “I am the most
enlightened man ever!” I respect you because you are simple, ordinary,
vulnerable, fallible.</p><p><br></p><p>If existence is ready to accept you, who I am not to accept you? All
the religions have been rejecting you. And it is a strange phenomenon:
they go on condemning you, rejecting you, humiliating you – and you go
on falling at their feet, worshipping them.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not worship me, you need not fall at my feet. You need not
in any way think of yourself as my followers. You are my fellow
travelers.</p><p>As long as it suits you to be with me, be with me. The moment you
feel it is time to depart on some crossroad, then go to Santa Fe. I have
nothing against Santa Fe. Santa Fe is my commune – just a few camels
have gathered there.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WOULD YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GACHCHHAMIS? HOW CAN WE
KEEP THEM FRESH AND ALIVE AND PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING LIKE THE
MEANINGLESS, STEREOTYPED RITUALS PRACTICED IN OTHER RELIGIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you, not on the gachchhamis. If you are alive, if you
are full of love, if you are as curious as a child – wondering about
everything in life – if you are alive, flowing, then whatever you do
will remain alive. You are trying to throw the responsibility on the
gachchhamis.</p><p>Please remember: everything, if you do it as a duty, will be dead.
Everything, if you do it out of love, will be alive – you are pouring
yourself into it.</p><p><br></p><p>When you wake up in the morning do you say, “Shit! Again?” Then your
day is going to be what you want: it is going to be shit. But if you
wake up in the morning, just the way a child opens his eyes for the
first time, looks all around: such an immensely beautiful world – so
many colors, so many birds</p><p><br></p><p>singing, the sun and the moon and the stars... and the people, each
individual and unique. The child makes everything alive.</p><p>See a child trying to catch a butterfly – those colors of the
butterfly, the beauty of it! He is running. Most probably he will not be
able to catch it, because butterflies are clever enough. They will sit
and create the desire in the child, that now is the moment; and as he
reaches close by, again they are on the wing. But the child is enchanted
with flowers, with seashells, with anything! Colored stones on the
beach.…</p><p>In my childhood, my mother had to take all kinds of things from my
pockets. Now I have no pockets, then I used to have four: two on the
side, two in the front – and long pockets. I harassed the tailor, “The
pockets have to be as long as possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But that looks odd. And your father says something else to
me, ‘Don’t listen to him.’ And it</p><p>is not beautiful to have that long a pocket, four pockets. And what
do you do with those pockets?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There are so many things to collect in the world – beautiful
stones by the riverside. It is so</p><p>challenging.”</p><p>My mother had to empty my pockets before I went to sleep, because
otherwise all those stones would be on the bed and I would not be able
to sleep. But she had to keep them, because in the morning the first
thing I would ask was, “Where have all those stones gone?” I had piles
of stones, seashells; and collecting all these things I was more happy
than King Midas must have been.</p><p><br></p><p>Midas had the blessing of gods. He had been praying for it; so
remember always, sometimes prayers just by accident come true. He was
praying that the power should be given to him that whatever he touches
becomes gold. And then he was caught. He was the most miserable man the
world has known.</p><p><br></p><p>He would touch his food and it would become gold. Even his own
children would not come close to him, because he had touched one of his
boys; he was standing there – a golden statue of course, but dead. The
people of his court escaped. His own wife was not ready to sleep with
him – not even in the same room, because who knows? In sleep he may
touch you, and you are finished!</p><p><br></p><p>That man was deserted by everybody, and he was surrounded with
nothing but gold. His palace was gold, his streets were gold, the trees
of his garden were gold. It was all gold, and Midas was the most poor
man in the world. Not a single friend; even his own wife and children
finally escaped. He died in utter misery and starvation, because water
he could not drink, food he could not eat. Whatever he touched
immediately became gold. He had to carry the great weight of his clothes
– because they all became gold. Now he understood what he had asked for.
This was a golden poverty, golden death. But it was not alive.</p><p>Remember that: it depends on you, it is your touch that keeps things
alive or dead.</p><p><br></p><p>The gachchhamis have to be understood. The first thing: they are not
prayers, because there is no God to whom you can pray. The gachchhamis
are your decision. And because you are so asleep, you have to go on
reminding yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The first is, buddham sharanam gachchhami: I go to the feet of the
awakened one. It does not say, “I</p><p>go to the feet of Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Gautam Buddha” – no.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddham is not Gautam Buddha. Gautam Buddha’s original name was
Gautam Siddharth. When he became awakened, then Siddharth was dropped
and the world has know him since then as Gautam Buddha. “Buddha” is
nobody’s property. It simply means the sleep is over, you are no longer
dreaming, no longer hallucinating; you are simply awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Reminding yourself, “I go to the feet of the awakened one,” is not
worshipping, because the awakened one is not any person in particular.
There are no feet of the awakened one. It simply says, and reminds you,
that you are surrendered to the fact of awakening, that this is your
decision, this is your commitment.</p><p><br></p><p>The second line of the gachchhamis is, sangham sharanam gachchhami: I
go to the feet of the commune of the awakened one. Why? Because the
awakened one is no longer an individual. He becomes spread over all
those people who love him.</p><p><br></p><p>My commune is me. So anybody who tries to divide – he loves me but he
does not love my commune – has not understood it at all. And he does not
love me – he is befooling himself. If he loves me, then it is natural
that he will love those who love me. The commune is all those people who
are seeking and searching to be awakened. At least one decision they
have made, that they love the awakened one and they would like to have
the same quality to their consciousness. Howsoever long the journey may
be, they are determined to reach the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>In the commune there will be all kinds of people: a few will be
camels, a few will be lions, a few may have become children. It is a
good hit for your ego. To go to the feet of the awakened one may again
create from the back door the same ego. But to go to the feet of the
commune, where there are camels Sometimes you will touch the feet of the
camel. Sometimes the lion will roar at you when</p><p>you are trying to touch his feet; he may make a breakfast of you. And
the child.…</p><p><br></p><p>No culture, no society, no religion, has respected the child. Every
culture is trying to make the child behave in the ways of the old people
because they know what is right; how can a child know what is right? A
child has to be trained, nurtured. He is thought by all the
civilizations of the world to be a savage, a primitive. He has to be
cultured, he has to be made civilized. They are all cutting and pruning
the child and trying to make him a good citizen.</p><p>The old man has been respected by all the cultures, all the
religions, all the societies. Why? Just because he has lived seventy
years, eighty years, ninety years? All old people become cunning.
Naturally their experience of life makes them cunning. The more cunning
you are, the more successful you will be. They all become suspicious,
mistrusting, because the more you trust, the more you will be exploited.
You have to continually go on mistrusting everybody, so nobody can
manage to exploit you.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man has learned that life is a struggle, a struggle to
survive. It is a continuous war against the whole world. Everybody is at
your neck – before he cuts your neck, you have to cut his. There is no
time, you cannot wait; you have to be the first to cut, to destroy the
other. And this old man has been respected by everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I am telling you, respect the child, because the child is innocent,
trusting, loving, enjoying the small things of life. He has no desire to
rise higher on any ladder of success. He is utterly contented – you have
not yet poisoned him. Your educational system has not yet put his mind
on the way of ambition. The child has no ambition. And the awakened one
regains his childhood.</p><p>The awakened one comes back to a greater childhood, to a greater
innocence. The child’s innocence was not his achievement, he was simply
ignorant of the ways of the world; but the awakened one has passed
through the whole life’s experience, the whole expanse of good, bad –
and still, by becoming awake, he has dropped it.</p><p><br></p><p>The child was going to be corrupted sooner or later. The awakened one
cannot be corrupted. The child’s innocence was really ignorance. The
awakened one’s innocence is not ignorance, it is his wisdom. But it is a
circle, complete. As a child he started, moved around the world and its
experiences – miseries, sufferings, anxieties, anguishes – and has come
back to the same point again. The circle is complete, he has become a
child again.</p><p>So in the commune there will be many camels – the new arrivals are
bound to be camels, some old stubborn guys are going to be camels. There
will be lions who have dropped their camelhood. And there will be a few
children – innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>To go to the feet of the commune simply means to destroy your ego
completely. It is so easy to go to the feet of the awakened one; it is
more difficult to go to the feet of the commune. More difficult, because
your ego will hurt; but more important, because that ego has to be
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third gachchhami sutra is: I go to the feet of the ultimate
law of the awakened one.</p><p>The ultimate law is just to be silent, utterly at ease, without any
condemnation of any part of your being – a total acceptance.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been asked hundreds of times<span class=s6></span>One day a
woman came and said, “You have given sannyas</p><p>to my husband. Do you know that he is a drunkard? Have you told him
to stop drinking?” I said, “Why should I tell him to stop drinking?”</p><p>She said, “But what kind of a sannyasin is he?”</p><p>I said, “Anybody who comes to me is bound to have weaknesses,
frailties. I have no condemnation. You think your husband has not told
this to me? This was the first thing. With tears he has told me, ‘Please
let me tell you that I am a drunkard. I have tried my hardest to stop
drinking before I came to you for sannyas, but it is impossible. In this
life it is not possible for me to stop drinking.’”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “Let me take a chance. If you refuse, it is perfectly
okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But if you give me sannyas knowing perfectly well that I am
a drunkard, then<span class=s6></span>You know</p><p>better.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to the woman, “Your husband has exposed himself – that is
simplicity. He was not hiding anything. And there is nothing to be
worried about. Sannyas is the beginning of transformation. It</p><p><br></p><p>does not ask you All the religions have asked you first to fulfill
certain conditions and then you</p><p>can be a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a totally different kind of man. My approach is utterly
different. I say become a sannyasin without any conditions and sannyas
will transform you slowly, slowly, and will bring into existence all
those qualities that other religions were asking before sannyas. Before
sannyas, those qualities are not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>“If I say to this man, ‘First you stop drinking alcohol completely,
only then can I give you sannyas,’ he will not be able to . He has tried
his whole life – and the more you fail again and again, the more you
know that it is completely useless to try. You know you are going to
fail. I don’t make any conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have given sannyas to your husband. Don’t be worried, because my
sannyas is not renouncing the wife or the children or the house or the
business of the world. I am bringing a totally new conception of sannyas
into the world.</p><p>This request for sannyas is only the decision of a sleeping man.
Perhaps in a moment when the sleep is not so thick, and he is just on
the borderline from where he can be awakened You know in</p><p>sleep sometimes you are fast asleep, in a deep sleep; and sometimes
the sleep is thin – you can even hear voices, people talking, vehicles
moving on the road. You are still asleep, but very superficially. In
these superficial moments of sleep a person hears about sannyas, and the
alchemy of it, and the transformation that is possible through it.</p><p>“I give sannyas without any conditions. This is enough, that the man
has asked to become a sannyasin. He is far better than those who don’t
drink, than those who don’t smoke, than those who don’t gamble. He is
far more courageous, and far more simple.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a few days the man came and said, “You have created a trouble
for me” – because in India if people see a sannyasin they simply fall at
his feet. A sannyasin passing by, you have to touch his feet. He has
done something that you also desire to do but are not strong enough to
do – he has done it. But those people were not aware that he is my
sannyasin. And I had chosen the red color particularly for that purpose,
because in India that has been for centuries the color of the
sannyasin.</p><p>The drunkard said, “I am now really in a difficulty – people touching
my feet, and I am a drunkard, a third-rate man! Now I have to do
something. This is just too heavy for me, that a brahmin is touching my
feet! And I cannot go to the pub, because in this dress if I go to the
pub I tried first not to go,</p><p>but the temptation was too much. So one day I went there, and even
the manager of the pub touched my feet. He said, ‘You have become a
sannyasin? It is a miracle!’ I had gone to ask for alcohol, but I said
that I had just come to see the old friends, and came back home without
any drink! Now what am I to do?”</p><p>I said, “Now it is your business. My business is finished. You asked
for sannyas – I gave you</p><p>sannyas. Now, you have to work it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are dangerous! You trapped me: you said there are no
conditions.” I said, “There are no conditions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he said, “all the conditions are coming in . Even my wife has
stopped sleeping with me” – because no woman in India will sleep with a
sannyasin; that is thought to be a sin. He said, “My wife used to
quarrel with me continuously. Once in a while when I was too drunk and
people carried me home, she had even beaten me. Now she touches my feet
every morning. And I think, ‘My God! I have lost my wife. And Osho was
saying you are not to renounce, but this is renunciation. I have not
done anything – she has renounced me!’</p><p><br></p><p>“My children had never paid any respect to me. They all were against
me, they were in favor of their mother. They thought that I was
destroying the whole family, their future, their education, because I
was wasting the money that I earned on alcohol. Now before going to
school, they all touch my feet, they ask for my blessing. And just the
other day a man got married in my neighborhood and the couple came to
ask for my blessings. That was too much!”</p><p>I said, “Now, you try whatever you can” – and he did try. It became
clear to him that in his whole life nobody had respected him, nobody has
accepted him as a human being, nobody had thought that he was
intelligent. Now it is difficult to go back. He has to go forward
whatsoever the troubles, whatsoever the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>And he turned out to be not only a lion, but a child too. He is a
poor man, but somehow he managed this festival to come here. I enquired
how he managed. He sold his house, he sold his land. He arranged for
some other sannyasin to give the guarantee bank balance because he had
no bank balance. And there is no need for him to go back, because all
that he had he has sold. His children are grown-up and he had come here
with his wife. He is now old.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “At least once more I wanted to see you, because time is
fleeing fast. I am old enough – seventy-five – any day I may be gone.
But I didn’t want to leave this world before I had seen you once more,
so I have risked everything.”</p><p>I was surprised because the wife was also a sannyasin; I had given
sannyas only to him. I asked,</p><p>“What happened to your wife?”</p><p>He said, “I have given sannyas to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate law is to be innocent, simple, incorruptible, trusting
in life and existence and just floating with the river – not fighting
against the current, but going with the river wherever it is going, just
being in a let-go. The moment you are in an absolute let-go, the
ultimate law of life is clear to you. It is let- go, totally – no
conflict with existence, a merger, a communion.</p><p><br></p><p>The gachchhamis are not a prayer; this is simply your determination.
But because you are asleep, asleep in different stages – somebody asleep
in the stage of the camel, somebody asleep in the stage of the lion And
there are more stages in between. These three are just to make it
convenient</p><p>for you to understand, because between the camel and the lion there
will be many steps; it is a growth. Between the lion and the child there
will be many steps; it is a growth. It is your whole program of
sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>The gachchhamis are a continuous reminder. But whether they will
become dead, stereotyped or not, is not in my hands. It is up to you.
You have to keep them alive, and the only way to keep them alive is to
live, yourself, more abundantly, more intensely, more totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Your intensity, your totality will give more life to the gachchhamis.
Your each single remembrance of the gachchhamis will be a step forward
towards the ultimate law, when you are born again, when the child in you
is back. The world had taken it away, but now you have found your lost
childhood. Now nobody can take it away.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>21</span></p><p><br></p><p>The master is nothing but a sculptor</p><p><br></p><p>19 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN I READ YOUR BOOKS I HAVE FELT GREAT LOVE FOR YOU. NOW THAT I AM
HERE I FEEL LESS LOVE. SITTING IN DISCOURSE I FEEL MORE BACK PAIN THAN
LOVE. AND LATELY I’VE BEEN FEELING A LOT OF FEAR, EVEN HATRED, OF YOU. I
FEEL UNSURE OF YOU, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT “MY SANNYASINS.” IT
SEEMS THAT YOU EXPECT THE TOTAL YES, WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT AGAINST.
I’VE SEEN MANY LOVING, AWAKE PEOPLE HERE WHO FEEL DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT
HELPS ME, BUT IT WILL NOT LAST WHEN I HAVE GONE.</p><p>I am wondering how to address you: Mr. Camel, Mrs. Camel, or Miss
Camel? Perhaps the last is the best: you have been missing
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>You say when you were reading my books you loved me extremely. That
is dangerous, because your love is carrying, just as a shadow to it,
hatred. Extreme love is going to be followed by extreme hatred. So what
is happening to you is simply natural. It shows the quality of your
love: you don’t know what love is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is easy to love me reading my books, because books are dead. I am
not. It is easy to love the books because you can interpret what is said
in the book according to your mind. You can manage to read only that
which strengthens your ego, and bypass that which destroys your ego.
Books have</p><p><br></p><p>never been known to make anyone enlightened. What can books do? You
are the master of the book; it is in your hands to manipulate it in any
way you want.</p><p>So if you want to continue loving me extremely, please don’t come
near me. Then I am almost dead for you; those books are far more
valuable to you, they support you. You choose to hear, to read only that
which is in tune with your mind – and your mind is the problem. Your
mind has to be hammered. All your defenses have to be destroyed. And
when you come to me you are taking a risk. If you really come to me, you
will return a totally different man, with no ego, no defenses.</p><p>Against whom are you creating defenses? We are one with existence.
That oneness proves that there are not any real egos; all are phony.
Coming close to me you will become aware that your ego is phony, that
your defenses are just useless – they cannot prevent me from reaching
you. And the moment I start entering you, there is great disturbance;
hence you feel fear. Love disappears, fear comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Camel, you missed.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is fear, that is only a passage from love to hatred. You
never fear a person you love; you cannot fear a person you love. You are
absolutely open, vulnerable, without any defenses to the person you
love. That’s the meaning of trust. And if your love cannot create that
trust it is just something phony; you are living with an idea but not
with reality.</p><p>The ego is not you. And to discover yourself, the ego has to be
completely destroyed. That’s the</p><p>only way. The master is nothing but a sculptor.</p><p><br></p><p>Michelangelo was asked by a shopkeeper, “In this ugly rock, a marble
rock, which had been lying</p><p>there for almost a decade First I used to keep it in my shop, but
nobody bothered about it. In fact, everybody laughed at me: ‘What can be
made of this?’ Finally I threw it on the other side of the road. How did
you manage to see something in this rock?”</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know what Michelangelo said? He said, “Jesus called me from
the rock, and asked me, ‘Please, free me from this rock. I am encaged.’
I saw Jesus clearly in the rock. Just a little hammering is needed – a
few chips here, a few chips there – and Jesus can be discovered.”</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly that is the work of a master. You come to him as a rock, but
he goes on seeing in you something which you have not even imagined. He
is dashing directly towards that which is your essential reality. He has
to cut off pieces of rock here and there, and bring you to your real
shape.</p><p>Books cannot do that. You have purchased those books; you cannot
purchase me. You can manage to do anything to those books you want.</p><p>I never liked in my whole life to read a book from a library or from
somebody else, for the simple reason that people go on doing nasty
things to books. They will underline, they will make notes on the
margin. You can do anything to a book; the book cannot say, “What are
you doing to me?” A secondhand book is one of the most ugly phenomena in
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The book is absolutely in your hands. I am not in your hands; on the
contrary, you are in my hands. That creates fear, that creates a
trembling inside. That makes you alert that you are coming to a</p><p><br></p><p>dangerous place – one step more and you may be gone, and then you
will never be able to find yourself again.</p><p>The real work of the master is really murder: murder of that which
you are not. The master takes away all that which is not really there,
and strangely, gives you that which you have always been.</p><p>Fear is natural, it is a good sign. And when you fear someone, hatred
arises – a natural consequence, a simple, logical process. The person is
trying to destroy you. He is changing, transforming the way you think
you are. He is killing what you think is most valuable in you. Hatred,
extreme hatred... you began with extreme love, and you end up with
extreme hate.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to understand the whole process. This happens to
everybody. People who come to me either come through reading my books or
listening to their friends talk about me. They come here with a certain
image of me, certain expectations of me. They don’t come clean, clear.
And when they come here and they don’t find their expectations
fulfilled, great hatred arises. But this is in a way natural to the
state of sleep. Nothing is wrong with it; you just have to understand
the process and you will be free of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You meet people who have gone a little ahead of you – and that’s one
of the reasons for creating a commune. The gap between me and you may be
too big, and you may not be able to just take a jump over the gap. The
commune gives you a chance to jump in installments.</p><p><br></p><p>You meet somebody who is no longer a camel. He may not yet have
become a lion, but certainly he is no longer a camel; he is in the
process of transformation. That gives you courage that if the camel dies
that does not mean your death. And in fact, with the death of the camel
begins the birth of the lion.</p><p>You meet somebody whose lion is starting to roar, to declare to the
whole world its freedom, courage, fearlessness. By chance you may come
across a person who is just in the process of changing from a lion to a
child. To see that is a miracle! The ferocious lion, the dangerous lion
is turning into an innocent child. It gives you the hope that if it is
possible for somebody else, it is possible for you too. And you may come
across, by chance, the person who has become a child. That will give you
immense trust, confidence – also a challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>You are meeting people here, you say, and listening to them you feel
clarity, but you are afraid that when you are gone that clarity will be
gone also. Remember, if you feel this clarity is going to be lost when
you are gone from here, then it is not clarity; you are simply
hypnotized. Not that somebody is hypnotizing you – people here in the
commune are living their lives, nobody is interested in hypnotizing
anybody else. Who has time?</p><p>This life is so short – to love, to live, to be – it is so short for
a man who is seeking and searching for his inner truth. It is so long
for those who are simply dragging, waiting deep down for death to come
and release them.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions are death-oriented. They are focused beyond death,
they are turning their followers’ eyes beyond death. They are saying to
them, “Don’t be bothered with life. Somehow manage to remain alive till
the grave; don’t fall before you reach the grave. Just on the minimum
level, remain alive.” That is not life, but vegetating.</p><p><br></p><p>If your clarity is authentic and not just the influence of a person
who is a lion or a child, then it will remain with you – not only
remain, it will grow. So be very alert not to be impressed, not to be
influenced – those are poisons. They will give you false illusions of
clarity, enlightenment.</p><p>I have a disciple in Germany who had become enlightened many times.
But the trouble was, whenever he came back to see me, his enlightenment
would disappear. He was very angry. He said, “Whenever I am back in
Germany I become enlightened, and I feel very grateful to you. Just to
pay my respects, I come here, and my enlightenment is finished!”</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightenment that sannyasin was having was his autohypnosis. You
can hypnotize yourself. Reading my books you can say, “This is the
truth, and this is the truth I have always known. I had just forgotten
it. The book has brought it back to me.” But this bookish enlightenment
is not the true thing. You will have to face the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Meetings with the camels will be very comfortable, because they are
just like you. They are not strangers; you can understand their
language, they can understand your language. You can see beauty in them,
they can see beauty in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Meeting with the lion is a little difficult, but after all, a lion is
also an animal. There is a certain connection between the camel and the
lion. The gap is not very big, you can take the jump. But at least you
will be very much impressed – even if you remain a camel, you will be
very much impressed. These lions become prophets and messiahs to you,
because you know that you are a camel and only a lion can save you.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the lion roars, you know he has power. You are getting
hypnotized, but this hypnosis is of no use; it is a kind of
intoxication. When you go back home to meet your family of camels there,
you may start doubting whether you have really seen camels turning into
lions. Your logical mind will say it is absurd: how can a camel become a
lion? There is no way from being a camel to become a lion. Lions are
born out of other lions, they are not born out of camels.</p><p>It is because of this logical training of the mind that Hindus don’t
believe in converting anybody, Jews don’t believe in converting anybody.
In fact, for centuries Hindus have kept their doors closed. They say a
Hindu has to be born from other Hindus.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way that a Mohammedan can become a Hindu; it is simply
impossible that a Christian can become a Hindu. In fact, even within the
Hindu fold there are four castes; nobody can move from one caste to
another. A sudra is born a sudra, and he will die a sudra – he cannot
become a brahmin. A warrior, a chhatriya, is destined to remain a
chhatriya, – he cannot become a brahmin. The brahmin is the highest
caste. Brahmins are born, not converted.</p><p>Jews also, for centuries, have believed that they are the chosen
people of God. Now, it is up to God to make somebody a Jew. How can you
convert anybody? – it is not within your power. And you are a superior
race. Now, how can you change a man belonging to an inferior race? You
cannot change his blood, you cannot change his bones, you cannot change
his marrow, you cannot change his soul.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two most ancient religions. Both have denied
conversion. New religions, of course –</p><p>Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism – have to convert people;
otherwise, from where are they</p><p><br></p><p>going to get numbers, congregations? If a Buddhist is only to be born
from Buddhists, where are the Buddhists? Conversion is the idea of new
religions to expand their empires.</p><p>Back home you will start thinking perhaps you hallucinated here,
perhaps you were hypnotized: you saw things which don’t happen in the
natural course of things. Camels are born camels and die camels. So you
start suspecting, doubting; your clarity is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is impossible for a lion to become a child. Perhaps a camel
may manage – camels are cunning and clever, very political and
diplomatic. The camel may go through plastic surgery, he may go to
Leeladhar and let himself be transformed into a lion. But even plastic
surgery will not be able to make a child out of a lion. This is a bigger
gap.</p><p><br></p><p>Animals – camel and lion both, howsoever different in shape – were
animals, they belonged to the same category. But the child is not an
animal. The jump is from animal to human being – and not an ordinary
human being, but innocent, awakened, pure of heart, full of trust. No
plastic surgery can do that, so you must have dreamed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Back home amidst camels and their scholars and their logicians, you
will feel yourself stupid even to say that you have seen lions, that you
have seen the child being born as a transformation of the lion. Nobody
is going to believe you, they will think you have gone nuts.</p><p>The gap between the camel and the lion is not very big, but the gap
between the lion and the child is very big. And unless you are a child
you cannot love a master. Now comes the biggest gap, because to love a
master you will need certain qualities in you.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens in ordinary love? Try to understand. You fall in love
with a man or a woman. The qualities are in the woman with whom you have
fallen in love: she is beautiful, she is young, she is juicy. You are
falling in love without thinking at all about yourself, that you are not
beautiful, that you are not young, that you are a completely dry bone,
there is no juice. No, when you fall in love you are completely focused
on the object of love, you are not thinking about yourself. This is the
ordinary love which is going to change any moment into hate.</p><p><br></p><p>The love I have been talking about is the love where the whole
structure is just the opposite of your love. You don’t fall in love with
a master because the master has charisma, because the master has some
influence, he catches hold of your heart; or because he is convincing –
whatsoever he says seems absolutely right. No, if this is the way, it is
not going to last long.</p><p><br></p><p>The love I am talking about means you have to think of your
qualities. Are you as innocent as a child, as trusting as a child, as
open as a child, as silent as a child? If your love arises out of your
child, your innocence, then whether the master lives or dies will not
make any difference. Whether the master says this or contradicts that
will not affect your love. The master may be contradicting himself
continually. That will not affect your love because it was not dependent
on the master’s statements.</p><p><br></p><p>Your innocence is not an ordinary thing, it is something immensely
valuable. In your innocence you will be able to see that in the
contradictory statements of the master there is no contradiction, that
there is a hidden connection between them, that in fact they are not
contradictions but part of each other – complementaries, not
contradictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Can light exist without darkness? Can darkness exist without light?
Can man exist without woman or vice versa? Can life exist without death
or vice versa? These are not contradictions, these are complementaries.
They are two sides of the same coin, they are always together.</p><p>Only very mediocre minds are consistent. Idiots are absolutely
consistent, they never contradict; in fact they never say anything, so
there is nothing to contradict. Their whole life is a simple
consistency: they remain idiotic, they keep their quality of idiocy just
the same. From the cradle to the grave they are the most consistent
people in the world, nothing changes in them. They are really dead; they
don’t have any intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>The more intelligent a person is, the more he has to contradict
himself, because each moment his vision is growing, each moment his
insight is deepening, each moment brings new facts, new truths. And he
is not a coward who closes his eyes to that which is opening up in front
of him. And he is under no obligation to the past – that which he had
said in his childhood he has to repeat when he is a young man, when he
is old, to remain consistent.</p><p>Intelligence is such a growing, expanding phenomenon, and each small
truth discovered changes the whole map. You cannot go on keeping the old
intact; the old has to be dropped and the new has to be accepted. Do you
know, all the religions insist that that which is old is gold. The older
it is, the golder it is. Each religion tries to stretch its oldness as
far back as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>When Christians came in contact with Hinduism they felt very
inferior, because the Christian religion says God created the world four
thousand and four years before Jesus was born – there is no past beyond
that. In fact, you can go back only to Jesus Christ; you cannot even go
beyond him, because beyond him is Judaism. Christianity is only two
thousand years old. In India Christians came across scriptures ten
thousand years old. They were simply confused – what to make of it?</p><p><br></p><p>They had tried their best to bring everything within six thousand
years. That’s why they go on insisting that the Hindu religion is five
thousand years old. But the evidence is not in their favor. They may go
on teaching that to the Christians – who are already convinced, there is
no need to bring evidence before them – but all the evidence shows that
Hinduism is at least ninety thousand years old.</p><p>In the most ancient Hindu scripture, the RIGVEDA, there is a
description of a configuration of stars which, according to the
astronomers, really did happen ninety thousand years ago. And since then
that certain configuration of stars has not happened again. And it is
described in full detail; the RIGVEDA is certainly ninety thousand years
old – it may be older, but that much is certain. In no other scripture
of the world is that configuration described, because they all were
latecomers.</p><p><br></p><p>But Hinduism finds it difficult to prove that it is older than
Jainism, because the Jainas’ first master, Adinatha, is referred to with
great respect in the RIGVEDA. Now, contemporaries are never referred to
with such respect – contemporaries are criticized.</p><p>Jesus was crucified by Jews, and now the great rabbis and the pope
are trying to come together and forget the past. The pope has informed
all his congregations around the world, “We have to drop this
anti-Jewish attitude that we have carried for two thousand years
unnecessarily. One Jew, the high priest, was responsible. For his
responsibility you cannot make all the generations that follow
responsible.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Jews are also willing – there is no problem, Jesus is no longer
a disturbance. But to the contemporary Jews he was a nuisance. No
contemporary Jewish scripture even mentions the name of Jesus. There is
no information about his crucifixion. It was such a big event, killing
an innocent man, who may have been a little bit out of his mind, but
that is not a crime. Everybody has the birthright to go out of his mind,
there is no problem in it. If Jesus needed anything, he needed sympathy;
he needed treatment, not crucifixion.</p><p><br></p><p>But the contemporary Jews were very much disturbed, because he was
proclaiming himself the messiah the Jews had been waiting for. “I am the
one,” he said, “for whom you have waited so long. Now I have come to
save you all.” A carpenter’s son, uneducated, coming from a small
village, Bethlehem They have seen him cutting wood, chopping wood,
working with his father in his small</p><p>workshop making benches and chairs, and suddenly has this boy gone
mad? He has become the</p><p>messiah who is going to deliver everybody from all their sins!</p><p>Jainas say, “If Adinatha is so respectfully mentioned in the RIGVEDA
even though he was against the brahmins, against the brahmin religion
How can the RIGVEDA mention his name with such</p><p>respect?” The logic seems to be significant. They are saying that
Adinatha must have preceded the RIGVEDA by a few centuries, and by that
time he was no longer a contemporary. Now his name can be mentioned with
respect, he cannot do any harm. Jainism also does not believe in
converting anybody. A Jaina is born a Jaina; you cannot become a
Jaina.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is trying to take their religion as far back as possible.
Why? What is the argument behind it? The older the religion is, the
truer. But new religions like Mohammedanism, which is only fourteen
hundred years old, and Sikhism, which is only five hundred years old,
are in great trouble. They have also been trying to find something
against all these old religions which prove their truth by their age –
as if religion is like wine; the older it is, the better.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedans say the latest religion in the world is Mohammedanism.
And of course, when man was primitive, God gave the RIGVEDA to the
world, because people could not understand more than that. Its age only
proves that it was given to primitives, aboriginals who were just coming
out of the trees and trying to learn to walk on the ground. Naturally,
God could not give them the ultimate truth; nobody would have understood
it.</p><p>Now is the time, they say. Now means fourteen hundred years ago, when
God decided man was grown-up enough, and he sent his last messenger –
because now there will be no need to improve upon it; he has given his
final judgment.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedanism, Sikhism try to prove.… Sikhism says, “Even
Mohammedanism is old. We are only five hundred years old. There must
have been some confusion because God has sent the latest message now
with Nanak, the founder of Sikhism.”</p><p>That message too, is now five hundred years old. Do you want me to
say that I bring you the last message? I am not going to say it. I am
not going to be in the company of all these fools who have been trying
somehow to make their religion look bigger, higher, truer.</p><p><br></p><p>I say to you that I am not bringing anybody’s message – because there
is nobody! I want you to understand that I am simply trying to share my
experience with you. It is always fresh, always young; it is always in
the now, in the here. That is a fundamental quality of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>And I’m not saying that after me there will be nobody who will
experience it. On the contrary, I am saying to you that if you
understand me, there are going to be millions of people after me who
will go on and on and on discovering more and more. Even if they have to
contradict me, don’t bother about it – let them contradict. Who am I? I
am not closing the doors. I am not putting a lock on the door and taking
the keys with me. My house is without doors. It is open from everywhere
– and I want it to remain always open.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, people who will be coming will make new arrangements of
the furniture in the house. They may plan a new architecture for the
house, they may make new plans for the garden. I leave it to them, but
the process will be the same.</p><p>This is a great jump, from the child to the master. The child is
innocent, full of love. He falls in love with a master because something
in his innocence, in his lovingness, in his openness, resounds with the
heartbeat of the master. He in fact does not go into a relationship with
the master, he becomes one with the master; hence it is a great jump.
You are completely disappearing. But don’t be worried, the master has
disappeared long before you, and in disappearing he has found
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are courageous enough to disappear in the master, you will
find yourself for the first time. Then you can move amongst camels – in
fact, you can ride on them. You can play with lions, you can commune
with children. You can commune with flowers, with rivers, with
mountains. Now there is no barrier for you. Now you are as big as the
whole universe.</p><p>P.D. Ouspensky, in his great contribution to humanity, TERTIUM
ORGANUM I have come across</p><p>more books perhaps than anybody else in the whole world, but TERTIUM
ORGANUM has a beauty that no other book has. Your bibles and gitas and
korans and talmuds, all are far behind.</p><p>In TERTIUM ORGANUM Ouspensky states one thing which is tremendously
beautiful for you to understand. He says, “In ordinary mathematics” –
and he was one of the greatest mathematicians of this century – “in
ordinary mathematics, the part is smaller than the whole, the whole is
bigger than the part. It would be absurd in ordinary mathematics to say
that the part is equal to the whole.” And this is coming from a
mathematician. He says, “But I have discovered a new mathematics, a
higher mathematics, where the part is equal to the whole – not only
that, sometimes bigger than the whole.”</p><p><br></p><p>It looks mysterious, not logical – certainly against Aristotle. But I
say to you, he is talking about the mathematics of consciousness. When
you dissolve, you don’t become just a part of the whole, you become the
whole. And there is every possibility that you go on growing and become
bigger than the whole, because growth is the ultimate law of life.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be difficult logically to understand it. It is something to
be experienced. Since the moment I found the ego evaporating from me, I
have not felt part of the universe, but the universe itself. And yes, I
have found many moments when I am bigger than the universe – because I
can see the stars moving within me, the sunrise happening within me, all
the flowers blossoming within me.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t believe in it because I am saying it. Take the jump from
the child to the master. Miss Camel, it is time: you should stop
missing!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHY AM I SO AFRAID OF BEING FREE?</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is. Freedom is a great risk. People talk about freedom, but
nobody really wants to be free. It is pure talk. Everybody wants to be
dependent, everybody wants somebody else to take the responsibility. In
freedom you are responsible for every act, every thought, every
movement. You cannot dump anything on anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch a Freudian psychiatrist, psychoanalyst. The patient is
lying down on a couch, the psychoanalyst is sitting behind so the
patient cannot see him. He is sitting behind the couch; he can see the
patient, but the patient cannot see him. Some psychoanalysts use
curtains so that the patient feels he need not keep his secrets to
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>And what happens – in all psychoanalysis sessions all over the world,
what is happening? The patient goes on dumping everything either on the
mother – mostly on the mother – or on the father. But he is not taking
any responsibility upon himself. He is trying to prove that he is
absolutely innocent; everybody else is at fault and driving him to do
things that he never wanted to do in the first place.</p><p>Perhaps there is some truth in it, that’s how it is happening:
mothers are driving their children... mothers are trying to make their
daughters real ladies – British ladies! American won’t do. In fact, in
America the lady has disappeared. In California there are only women, no
ladies. The father is trying to make his son a real man, a gentleman. So
there is some truth in it.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you are grown-up and you see the whole scene, what has
happened, you can simply drop it – just like that! But you don’t want
to, because then you will be responsible. If right now you do something
wrong, you can always point towards somebody who is responsible for
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is afraid of freedom. That’s why all around the world,
layers of slaveries exist in you. Every person is a multiple slave. He
is a slave to the parents, he is a slave to the religion, he is a slave
to the state, he is a slave to the neighbors – all kinds of slaveries
which are not visible.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was a student in the university, I had a roommate with me for
the whole year, and I had never thought that something was wrong with
his speech. Then his father came to meet him and he started stuttering.
I was amazed; I said, “What is the matter with you? Since your father
has come you have been stuttering, you cannot speak the way you have
always been speaking.”</p><p>He said, “From my very childhood he has been teaching me how to
speak, what to speak, what not to speak, whom to speak to, when to
speak. He confused me so much that I lost my own sensibility, and
stuttering started.” He said, “I was amazed myself when I came to the
university: leaving the house behind, my stuttering disappeared. And
whenever I go to my house and to my family and to my town, the
stuttering starts again.”</p><p>I asked him, “When you go to the temple and pray to the father, God,
what happens?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The same thing, stuttering comes in. The very word”father”
is enough – any father-figure.”</p><p><br></p><p>When he was called for something by the vice-chancellor of the
university, I went with him. He asked</p><p>me, “Why are you coming?”</p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried. I will be just outside the room
waiting for you.” “But,” he said, “there is no need.”</p><p>I said, “I will explain it to you afterwards.”</p><p><br></p><p>And inside the room of the vice-chancellor, he was stuttering. I had
to enter without asking permission. Both were shocked. He was shocked
because he was stuttering. The vice-chancellor was shocked also: “Don’t
you know that you have to ask permission? And I am talking to
somebody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The situation was such that I had to come in suddenly. I
wanted to catch him stuttering before you for two reasons: I want to
make it clear to him that it is not that something is wrong in him. Any
father-figure, any authoritative figure causes his stuttering. And you
are the highest authority in the university, so I wanted you also to
know: please come down, don’t make poor students stutter; you are not a
big daddy. That’s why I had to come in without asking, and suddenly. And
I have caught you both red-handed. You are being authoritative, and that
is ugly. You are imposing something on the poor student, who is already
burdened with his daddy.”</p><p>The vice-chancellor said, “Perhaps you are right – I was shouting at
him. I will never do such a thing to anybody again; I don’t want my
students to stutter. When he started stuttering I was puzzled, ‘What is
the matter? Perhaps this is his habit.’”</p><p>I said, “It is not his habit. He has been living with me for the
whole year, and he has not stuttered a single time. But when his father
came, immediately things changed. Since then I have been watching: in
the temple when he prays to God the father, he stutters. I wanted to see
what happens between you and him. He is stuttering – you must have been
behaving authoritatively. There is no need. You have to be more human,
you have to be more friendly, you have to be more loving. You are not
his father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this student came out with me, and he said, “My father is
responsible.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “No, you are a coward. Every father is trying to improve upon
the son, because the son is going to take his place sooner or later.
That does not mean that the whole humanity is stuttering. You are a
weakling, and you are avoiding that responsibility. Just accept that you
have been a coward; otherwise, what is so great in your father? I have
seen him. In fact, you are taller than your father. If you wrestled with
him you would win, because he is getting old and you are in your prime,
healthy and young.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that old, small man makes you stutter! Still you throw the
responsibility on him. This is slavery,</p><p>mental slavery. But it gives you a relief that you are not the cause
of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Who is forcing you to go to the church, to the temple, to the
synagogue? Yes, when you were a child you were taken, but now? Still you
are continuing the old routine. And if you are forced to</p><p><br></p><p>explain, you will say, “It was my father who dragged me to the
synagogue. It was my Jewish mom who dragged me to this or that.”</p><p>You don’t see it as a slavery. It is a slavery. You have not been
fighting against it. Yes, I know, small children are dependent on the
parents, and the parents take every advantage of your dependence. They
know you cannot rebel, they know you cannot go anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>I figured out in my very childhood what makes them so authoritative:
“Perhaps they think I cannot rebel. Perhaps they think I cannot get food
if I go against them. Perhaps they think I will be lost in this vast
world without their protection.” So I had to do all these things; only
then would they understand that authority was not going to work with me.
I made it clear to my father, “One thing is absolutely certain: if you
want me to do something, please don’t say it authoritatively.”</p><p>He said, “Then in what way has it to be said?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have to ask me, ‘Will you please do it?’”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This seems to be too much. I have to ask my own son, ’Will
you please do it?”</p><p>I said, “You will have to say this. If you say to me ‘Go and do it!’
I am the last person to do it. I would prefer to die hungry, but I will
not do it. And if you ask me, ‘Will you please do it?’ I can even climb
Everest – there is no problem. I am doing it, it has not been forced
upon me. I don’t want to live like a slave in my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>One day my father was not at home. My uncle told me, “Lately I have
been seeing that you come in at any time of the night. You have to be
back home before nine o’clock” – because in India nine o’clock is really
night. It is not evening; the sun-sets at six, and then suddenly
everything becomes dark.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t know the contract between me and my father. You
can be certain I will never enter</p><p>the house unless nine o’clock has passed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had no children; he was just married and he was very cocky. In
fact, the Indian word for uncle is kaka – and he was trying to be the
master of his wife. He said, “I repeat it again. If you don’t come
before nine, then I am not going to open the door.”</p><p>I said, “That is settled. I will remain outside the door the whole
night, but I am not going to accept authority in any way.” And that’s
what happened. He was thinking that in one hour, two hours, I would drop
the idea of remaining for the whole cold night outside.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact he became worried. My father was not in the town, and if I
became sick or something happened to me... The night was really cold and
it was getting colder. And he could not sleep either, because he was
waiting for me to knock. Finally, nearabout twelve, he opened the door
and he said, “Forgive me, just come in. Don’t create trouble for
me.”</p><p>I said, “I am not creating trouble for anybody. I am simply keeping
myself trouble-free.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the school, in the college, I always loved to be a little
mischievous. I felt those students who were not mischievous to be just
dull and dead. So I would do something Just sitting in the class I
might</p><p>start what you do in darshan or satsang – I might start “Om-m-m” with
closed mouth. Now “Om” is a religious, sacred word to the Hindus. Nobody
can say that this is wrong to do; but in the class when the teacher was
teaching, and he was writing on the board and his back was towards
us.…</p><p>He turned suddenly, looked all around – everybody was silent – and he
asked, “Who was making this sound of Om?”</p><p><br></p><p>And I would always stand up. I would say, “I did it. It is a sacred
sound.” He said, “I know, but in a class when I am teaching you
something<span class=s6></span>”</p><p>I said, “You cannot teach anything higher than Om! And why are you
getting so freaked out? You should have continued your work. Om would
have remained in the background; it is not a problem.”</p><p>He would drag me to the principal – it was almost an everyday ritual.
The principal would say, “So you have come. Can’t you leave these
professors at ease even for a single day?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Today I was doing such a spiritual thing. And I could have
remained silent when he asked who had done it. I know perfectly well
that nobody in my class can point his finger towards me, because they
all know that I will create trouble for them, they are perfectly aware
of it. There was no way for him to find out. I stood up myself. In fact,
he should be respectful towards me: I did it, I accept it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Many professors have asked me, “Why<span class=s6></span>? You are
such a nice guy in every possible way, we cannot</p><p>find a better student. But once in a while, what goes on? You start
doing something which is</p><p>unexpected.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not unexpected, at least as far as I am concerned. It
is absolutely prepared.” “But why do you do it?” they would ask.</p><p>I would say, “For a single reason, that I don’t want to become a
slave in any way. I want to keep my freedom intact whatsoever the cost.
If I feel like chanting ‘Om’, then I don’t care what happens to me. I
chanted it, and I have not harmed anybody; I have simply saved my
freedom. And I take the whole responsibility for it!”</p><p><br></p><p>In the school, the headmaster stopped even asking why I had been
brought, because it was an everyday affair – sometimes twice a day –
that I would be brought to the headmaster. In the beginning he used to
enquire, “What has he done? What happened?” – this and that. After a few
days he stopped enquiring, he simply gave me the punishment.</p><p><br></p><p>He would say, “Go around the whole building seven times.”</p><p><br></p><p>I would say, “Yes, that’s okay, but I will go nine times – not less
than that.” He said, “Are you mad? This is a punishment, we are not
rewarding you!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is my way of changing the quality of the punishment. I
am enjoying it – the wind is cool, the trees are beautiful. Why seven?
At least I cannot accept your order. I will go nine times; then I am
free of your authority, I am doing it on my own, and I’m enjoying it!
And you should remember that to be authoritative is ugly – you have to
understand me, why I did it. You don’t care to understand. You simply
listen to the teacher, you don’t even give a chance for me to
explain.”</p><p>That day he said, “Okay, what do you have to say? You were keeping
your hand on a boy’s shoulder in the class. In the classroom some
discipline has to be maintained, and you know it. The classroom is not
some place of entertainment – a park, a cinema hall. There you can walk
with your hands on someone’s shoulders, but not in the class.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I walked in the class with my hand on another student’s
shoulder simply to make this teacher freak out – because in the class he
continually says smoking is bad, and I have caught him red- handed,
smoking. Now this man should apologize to the whole class, because he
was lying to them when he said, ‘Don’t smoke.’ He himself smokes. He
says to the students, ‘Don’t go to the movies,’ and one day when I was
entering the movie house for the second show, he was coming out from the
first show.</p><p><br></p><p>“When I asked, ‘What are you doing here?’ He said, ‘I am your
teacher, you are not my teacher. You have no right to ask what I am
doing here.’ Is this a human way of behaving? I deny all kinds of
authoritativeness. And still he goes on telling the students, ‘Don’t go
to the movies, don’t waste your time. Don’t destroy your eyes’ – this
and that. And he is a regular visitor to the movie house.”</p><p>The movie house belonged to one of my friends’ father, so I had told
the friend, “Keep me informed how often he comes to the movie.” He was a
regular visitor, and a chain-smoker outside the class.</p><p>“I had to do something so that he can bring me to you, and I can
expose his reality. Now what do you say? Should I do nine rounds around
the school or he? As far as I am concerned, we both can go together, it
is perfectly good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Since that day, that headmaster stopped punishing me. He would always
ask, “Why? What was the reason?” And he was always satisfied with the
reason. In fact, teachers stopped sending me to the headmaster, because
there they found themselves guilty of doing something wrong. By and by,
they stopped preventing me from doing anything, because if I am doing
something, that means there must be much more to it – what can a teacher
do?</p><p>My headmaster changed and a new headmaster came into the school. And
the first day I went, he took his cane and he said, “I am a strict man,
and from the very first day I make it known to the school that I am
going to beat you badly.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can do it – but can you see, just there on the other
side of the road is the police station. And corporal punishment is
illegal – you start beating me and you will be behind bars! The court is
not far away, and I am a great friend of an old advocate who is the best
advocate in the town. And I have told him that this is going to happen:
‘I have heard about this man, that he beats students.’ And he has
promised me, ‘Let him do it – you come immediately to me and we will
file a suit against him in the court.’ So I have made my position clear
to you. Now, start beating.”</p><p><br></p><p>His cane fell from his hand. He said, “Are you a student or some
government agency?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am a simple student, but I don’t want any
authoritativeness over me. If I do anything wrong, I am ready for any
punishment. But just punishing me to prove your authority? I am the last
one to accept it.”</p><p>“And I was not wrong – the teacher has brought me to you.… It is
revengeful, because the other headmaster had stopped punishing me.
Rather, he had started telling the teachers, ‘It was not right on your
part.’ And today I have not done anything. Just when the teacher called
me, I was sitting on the bench with my legs on top of it. I don’t see
that it is a crime, I was simply relaxed. In fact, children should be
provided with chairs which are comfortable, with foot-rests so they can
relax.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you are relaxed you can understand things more easily. But in
Indian schools the benches are hard – it is just a copy of British
benches; in British schools the benches are hard. You have to sit on
those hard benches for six hours and it starts hurting.</p><p>“Something is wrong with you people. You are not teaching us but
torturing us, and under torture no teaching is possible. So I want to
know what wrong I have committed. Have I given a wrong answer to his
question? No, I was just keeping my feet on top of the table. These are
my feet. If I drag his feet and put them on the table, you can punish
me. But if you think this is a crime, you start punishing me, and I will
see you in the court.”</p><p><br></p><p>One has to understand one thing: What can happen? At the most, death
can happen. Remember a simple maxim: Hope for the best, and wait for the
worst. Then nobody in this life can disappoint you. Nobody can make you
a slave, physically or psychologically.</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu is a slave, a Christian is a slave, a Mohammedan – all these
religions are psychological slaveries, because they give you consolation
that if you follow and believe and have faith, then nothing wrong is
going to happen to you. They give you all kinds of strategies to remain
dependent. They teach you prayer – prayer is just begging.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t teach you any prayer. To whom are you praying? You have not
even asked the people who have taught you prayer. Kneeling down on your
church floor, you are humiliating yourself. I am not for egoist
assertion, but neither am I for humiliation to be accepted as humility,
humbleness. I want you to be simple, without any ego and without any
humbleness – straightforward, clear.</p><p><br></p><p>And freedom is such a great value – perhaps the greatest value in
life. It cannot be lost for anything. Even if death is the consequence –
I would rather accept death than accept anything that goes against my
freedom.</p><p>India was under the British Raj for almost three hundred years. My
whole family was in the freedom movement; they all have been in jails. I
was too young, but I was continually arguing with my father, with my
uncles, “Don’t blame Britain for your slavery. Such a vast country,
almost a continent, cannot be made a slave by a small country like
England. Somewhere deep down you are afraid of being free, somewhere
deep down you are ready to accept slavery. And still you go on throwing
the responsibility on Britain. But you have been a slave before too” –
India has been in slavery for two thousand years. Masters changed,
slavery remained.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is such a simple thing to see that if anybody wanted to make you
a slave, you became a slave, as</p><p>if you were just waiting for it, for somebody to invade you, somebody
to come and enslave you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told my family, “I don’t accept the idea of Mahatma Gandhi, that
Britain is responsible for India’s slavery. India itself is responsible
for its slavery; otherwise, just in a single hour, all the British
people can be thrown into the ocean. India just has to understand that
freedom is our birthright. How many Britishers are there? Not many.”</p><p>Is your mental slavery somebody else’s responsibility? No. You don’t
want to be responsible for your own acts, you don’t want to be
responsible for your way of life; that’s why you are afraid of being
free. Drop this fear. This fear is worse than anything that can happen
to anybody.</p><p>I teach you responsibility. But remember, don’t misunderstand me,
because all around you people are using the word “responsibility” with
an absolutely different meaning – in fact, diametrically opposite to the
meaning I see in the word responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>They say, “Be responsible to your parents.” That is not
responsibility, that is slavery. They say, “Be responsible to your
church, to your religion, to your faith.” That is not responsibility,
that is slavery. They say, “Be responsible to your nation.” That is not
responsibility. These are all beautiful words to cover up an ugly fact:
slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>When I use the word “responsibility,” I use it the way it should be
used. Responsibility means that whatever you do, it is your response. If
I ask you, “Does God exist?” and you say, “Yes, because it is written in
THE BIBLE,” your answer is not a responsible answer. It is out of your
Christian slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you say, “I don’t know. I have never come across God yet,”
this is your response. You are not repeating some catechism – Hindu,
Mohammedan, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish – no. You are facing the
question directly and responding to it. Responding on your own is the
meaning of responsibility.</p><p>Freedom brings responsibility. Responsibility helps you to become
more and more free. And only a person who knows the taste of freedom,
who knows the beauty of responsibility, is worthy of calling himself a
human being; otherwise, you are camels and nothing more.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>22</span></p><p><br></p><p>You are the only hope</p><p><br></p><p>20 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ARE YOU A MESSIAH, A PROPHET, OR A REINCARNATION OF GOD?</p><p>I have never expected that one of my sannyasins would ask such a
bullshit question!</p><p><br></p><p>I am simply myself. I am not a messiah, because there is no God to
send messengers to the world. Moreover, I don’t want to be crucified. To
prove that you are a messiah of God, crucifixion is absolutely
necessary. Not that I am afraid of death, but I would like a
comfortable, luxurious death. Not carrying the cross on my own
shoulders, not even on your shoulders – the cross will be carried on a
Rolls Royce limousine.</p><p>I am not a prophet either. I don’t know what is going to happen in
the next moment. I don’t know even what I am going to say in the next
moment. The future does not exist for me. That’s exactly the meaning of
the future: that which does not exist. And the prophet is one who
prophesies, predicts. This is the most cunning business in the whole
world.</p><p>And how can I be an incarnation of God? God is invented by those
people who want to be incarnations of God. Their God is phony –
American, plastic. And all those prophets, messiahs and messengers of
God, incarnations of God, what have they done to the world?</p><p><br></p><p>Look... in five thousand years, all these people have turned the
earth into a big madhouse. What kinds of things have they been telling
you to do? What kind of belief systems have they imposed</p><p><br></p><p>upon you? They have humiliated you, degraded you, turned you into a
subhuman species. All these messiahs, prophets, gods – they have made
life impossible, love impossible, laughter impossible. They have made
the whole earth a big graveyard.</p><p>And they have all been fighting with each other. Millions of people
have been killed because of these few criminals. Somebody is a Christian
– that means he is conditioned by the ideology of Jesus Christ. That
man, Jesus, was a crackpot! He was trying to save the whole world; he
could not save himself. He was telling people things which are
absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>He was telling the people, “Blessed are the poor.” As a corollary he
must have said, “Blessed are the ugly, blessed are the blind, blessed
are the deaf, blessed are the crippled.” All the blessed people are in
the hospitals. The most blessed of all are in Ethiopia. There is going
to be a tremendous fight on the day of judgement to decide who is the
most poor – because of course, if the poor are the blessed, then the
poorest is the Blessed One.</p><p><br></p><p>Forget it! No American can enter paradise. Nobody who has at least
two meals every day can enter paradise. You are all going to be defeated
by Ethiopians, by Indians. The western world has no hope!</p><p><br></p><p>But why did Jesus say, “Blessed are the poor”? He himself was poor,
uneducated, uncultured. There was no way for him to rise higher in any
hierarchy, to become richer, affluent, to have all the joys and comforts
of life. It was not possible for him, he was not capable of it – and he
saw millions of other people in the same boat. It was a
self-consolation: Blessed are the poor. I wonder why he did not say,
“Blessed are the poor carpenters”? He consoled himself, he consoled the
poor people.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know who was attracted to his teachings? – not a single man
who was rich, educated, who was living life joyously. He attracted
miserable people, poor people, starving people – and even they did not
come in multitudes.</p><p>Those who came to Jesus, you can count on your fingers. But they were
feeling great – this man has opened a door for their egos. This man is
the only begotten son of God; they had to believe it, because unless
they believed that he is the only begotten son of God, then what about
his promises about paradise? They believed in him – not truly; they
simply wanted a consolation, sympathy, and a hope that some day they
will take revenge on the rich, on those who are enjoying life and its
beauties.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, it was not possible even for Jesus to give them those
blessings here, now. They had to wait for death to come. Everything he
promises is after death. You can see the strategy. Nobody comes back and
says what there is after death. You can see the strategy. You can befool
people: just keep them drugged about the future life after death. And
those poor people, of course, wanted to live blissfully. They had failed
here; now comes this man – a carpenter, Joseph’s son – and gives them a
great hope, a promise.</p><p><br></p><p>But all those twelve apostles were simply idiots. Not a single one of
them had enough intelligence to wonder what was happening. Jesus turns
stones into bread, why can’t he turn all the mountains into great loaves
of bread? He knows the secret, and once you know a secret, it is only a
questions of using it on a bigger scale. There would have been nobody
poor.</p><p><br></p><p>He changes water into wine – why not change all the oceans into wine?
Nobody will feel thirsty ever again. He raises dead people from their
graves. But why only one person? Why only Lazarus? In Jesus’ lifetime,
many people must have died; he should have raised all of them. And if he
can raise a person who has been dead for four years, he can raise a
person who has been dead for four thousand years – Moses, Abraham,
Ezekiel. He could have raised all the prophets, at least, back to life.
But all these are stories invented to prove that this man is no ordinary
man: he is a messiah, he has extraordinary powers.</p><p>I don’t claim any powers, extraordinary or ordinary. I am a simple
human being. I don’t want to put myself on a high pedestal and condemn
you all for your sins, curse you all for your sins, and bless only those
few who have faith in me.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about other messengers of God, incarnations of God.
For example, Krishna is a Hindu incarnation of God – not a partial
incarnation, God has come in his wholeness on the earth to save it.
Strange, nobody seems to be saved. In fact, Krishna was the cause of
destroying the very backbone of India, because he forced his disciple
and friend, Arjuna, into a war.</p><p><br></p><p>Five thousand years ago that war happened. The whole responsibility
goes to Krishna – because Arjuna, the warrior, seeing millions of
people, started thinking, “What is the point of it all? – killing all
these people just to sit on a golden throne? There will not even be
people to see that you are sitting on a golden throne. What is the
point?”</p><p>Arjuna was far more intelligent than your incarnation of God,
Krishna. Arjuna said, “This war seems to be absolutely meaningless. I am
going to the Himalayas to meditate. Let my cousin-brothers rule, but at
least there will be life. I am not going to take this great
responsibility of killing so many people for my own glory, to become
Arjuna the Great.”</p><p>But Krishna is very clever, very cunning. He goes on arguing,
convincing, persuading Arjuna. And finally he says to Arjuna, “You don’t
understand that God wants this war, because without him not even a leaf
in a tree moves. You are not responsible if people are killed; it is
God’s will.”</p><p>And when you bring God in and relieve people of their responsibility,
it becomes difficult to refuse. I would have certainly refused it, but
Arjuna had a conditioned mind. Krishna says, “God’s WILL!... the war has
to happen whether you participate or not. By not participating you will
fall in the eyes of God. The war will happen.” His actual words are,
“You see these millions of warriors on both the sides gathered, alive?
In fact, they are just waiting to die. They are dead, you are not
killing them. You cannot do anything on your own; you are just a puppet
in the hands of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>God is the greatest lie that these people have been teaching. And in
the name of God you can convince people to do any stupid thing.</p><p>If I had been in the place of Arjuna I would have said, “Perfectly
okay, I am going to the Himalayas. How can I go to the Himalayas if God
is not willing me to go there? Let him kill these people through other
puppets.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was so simple. But Krishna goes on forcing him: “You are born in a
warrior family, you are a warrior</p><p>by nature, from your very birth. This will be dropping out. It will
be ugly, shameful to you and</p><p><br></p><p>to your whole family and to your forefathers. Don’t be a coward!
Prove your mettle – the opportunity has come!” And he forced Arjuna into
a war which is called Mahabharata, the Great Indian War. It must have
been something like the third world war which is looming on the horizon.
And there are so many Arjunas; only one Krishna is needed to convince
some Arjuna to start it, to be the pioneer.</p><p>It must have been of tremendous proportions, because since that war,
India has never been able to regain its strength. It has been going down
and down; it lost courage, it lost the joy of life. It became too
concerned about death. Any religion which is concerned too much about
death is fundamentally wrong. And all the religions are
death-oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say, all these messiahs, prophets, incarnations of God are
simply clever, cunning politicians. They have destroyed humanity, they
have poisoned you in every possible way. Whatsoever you enjoy is a sin,
and whatsoever you suffer is virtue. Look at their logic! They have made
you all into sado- masochists. You cannot recognize it, because all
around you are the same kind of people. Just in names they differ –
Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, Buddhists – but fundamentally what they
have done, and are doing, is exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>If you relish life, you are condemned. If you renounce life, you are
respected. If you enjoy the beautiful treasures that existence makes
available to you, you are going into the abysmal depth and darkness of
hell. But if you torture yourself... you stand on your head in the hot
sun of Oregon doing yoga exercises – which are nothing but inventions of
somebody who must have been a masochist – torturing yourself. You fast;
the longer you fast, the more spiritual you become.</p><p>I don’t see any connection between food and spirituality, between
hunger and spirituality. And if hunger is spiritual, rejoice about
Ethiopia! Those people are becoming holier and holier every day. Strange
that the missionaries – the pope, Mother Teresa, and their kind – are
appealing that “Ethiopia should be saved; people are starving, people
are hungry, people are dying in thousands.” This is contradictory.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethiopia today is the most holy land in the whole world. And if
thousands are dying, they will be entering paradise; they are the
poorest people in the world. Christians, particularly Catholics, should
rejoice all over the world that Ethiopia has become the real holy land –
it is no longer Israel. But they are asking for help, for food, for
people to come and save these dying, hungry people. For what? to convert
them to Catholicism?</p><p>These religious leaders need the world to remain poor; otherwise they
are out of a job. Mother Teresa receives the Nobel prize because she
takes care of orphans. Orphans are absolutely needed; otherwise Mother
Teresa loses her Nobel prize. It is necessary to create more orphans so
more Mother Teresas can be there. They become respectable, they receive
prizes, honorary degrees. They are welcomed all over the world, they are
thought to be great saints.</p><p>And to create more orphans, birth control methods should not be used.
Abortion should be illegal, criminal. If birth control methods are used,
and abortion is legal, then from where can you get the orphans? Those
orphans give business to the priests, to the pope. And those orphans are
your power, because you will convert them to your religion. It is a
simple politics of numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>I would say: if you don’t want poor and hungry people, starving
people and dying people, and</p><p><br></p><p>countries like Ethiopia, then you have to get rid of all your
messiahs, your prophets, your incarnations of God, because they are
basically, originally responsible for all this misery, suffering,
pain.</p><p>No, I absolutely deny having any kind of relationship with these
people. I am a simple human being, just the way you are. I am not
special in any way.</p><p>This is something momentous and historical that is happening here,
because never before have people gathered around an ordinary, simple man
who has no extraordinary powers, who has no miracles to his credit, who
does not walk on water Really, I find it difficult even to walk on
earth. I</p><p>am bobbily, almost a drunkard! Somehow I manage.</p><p><br></p><p>The day humanity is completely finished with these exploiters in the
name of religion, this very earth can become a paradise. There is no
need to wait for death. What has death to do with paradise? Paradise is
the way you live. Paradise has something to do with life, not with
death.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t listen to these people, just simple reasoning will show
you that this much population on the earth is impossible – we have
already crossed the borderline. Starvation is natural; nature is trying
to keep the balance, and you don’t allow nature to keep the balance
because you need more Catholics!</p><p>Why are people dying in poor countries? In the first place, why are
those countries poor? – because poverty has been praised, poverty has
been explained away by beautiful theologies.</p><p>Hindus say you are poor because in your past life you committed great
sins. It seems to be a very delayed result. The cause was in some past
life far away, and the effect comes now. You put your hand in the fire
and wait for the next life for it to get burned! Cause and effect are
connected; the cause is nothing but unmanifested effect. You cannot put
them so far apart, and you cannot put death in between than. But Hindus
have been doing that, Jainas have been doing that, Buddhists have been
doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>You give beautiful explanations to the poor, you give them
respectability. Mahatma Gandhi used to call the most poor people in
India Harijanas, the people of God. If to be poor, to be condemned by
the whole society... because Hindus don’t even touch them, they are
called untouchables. You will be surprised, they don’t touch these
people because there are so degraded; they don’t even allow their
shadows to touch them. If an untouchable passes by and his shadow
touches your body, you have to take a bath immediately to cleanse
yourself – you have been polluted.</p><p><br></p><p>And Gandhi calls them the people of God! If poverty, humiliation,
oppression, exploitation, make you people of God, then why should one
try to become rich? Because in the kingdom of God, even a camel can pass
through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man. Strange, camels are
holier than a rich man. Only the poor can enter there.</p><p><br></p><p>If that is the truth, then let this whole world be poor, suffering,
starving, dying. What is the need of serving the poor, giving them food,
hospitals, schools? What is the need? You are destroying their license
to heaven!</p><p><br></p><p>No, I don’t belong to this company. I absolutely disconnect myself
from all the religions of the world</p><p>that have existed before, because I say to you, they were not
religions. They were cunning strategies</p><p><br></p><p>of clever people to exploit you, to keep you in your ugly situation,
your disgusting state. These religions have not allowed you to make the
earth the Garden of Eden. I don’t have a God above the roof of Rajneesh
Mandir, so I cannot ask him, “Father, forgive these messiahs and
prophets and incarnations of you, because they do not know what they are
doing!”</p><p>I cannot pray in this way for two reasons: one, there is no God above
the roof – maybe some electrician working Secondly, I cannot say that
these prophets and messiahs and incarnations of</p><p>God do not know what they are doing. They do know! They are perfectly
aware of what they are doing. They are cheating you, they are keeping
you repressed; they are forcing you to remain attached to the past, to
the dead traditions, conventions, beliefs which have no evidence. They
are preventing you from rebelling against this whole nonsense!</p><p><br></p><p>To me, the truly religious person is a rebel, and his religion will
be rebellion against this state of affairs. I don’t want you to become
faithful, I want you to doubt intensely all that you have been taught to
believe.</p><p>I don’t say, “Remain contented as you are because contentment is a
great virtue.” Contentment is a great virtue, but these people are using
the word very cunningly. The real contentment comes only when you are
utterly happy, rejoicing, when you are so full of joy that you want to
dance and you want to sing, and you want to share – because you have so
much that if you don’t share it will become a heavy burden on you. Then
there is contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>But these people have been telling you, “Remain contented as you
are.” They are agents of politicians, they are agents of the status quo.
They have not allowed you to think of passing through a great revolution
so that we can have a better earth, a better humanity. They are not
concerned with humanity at all.</p><p>No, I am not a messiah. And it is very difficult too, to become a
messiah. First you have to be given birth to by a virgin girl – and who
wants to be a bastard? Strange things are expected of you ... Mahavira
does not perspire – I cannot manage that. Mahavira remains naked. There
is nothing wrong in remaining naked, particularly in a hot country like
India, but in winter when it becomes so cold, I don’t see any point.
Yes, when the sun is there and it is hot, it is perfectly good to be
nude – even in your office, sitting and working nude should be thought
rational. But in winter when things are getting frozen, to remain naked
I cannot do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, I cannot enter in this club of messiahs, prophets and
incarnations of God. But I am not sorry for that. I am immensely happy
that I was not born from a virgin girl; I am happy that I am the son of
my own father, not of somebody who is on the roof. I see utter ugliness
in all these people. But they have made it philosophical, and it is all
garbage, simply shit! But you can wrap around it beautiful philosophy,
theology, and it becomes a commodity of great price.</p><p>I am not with them, I am against them. And I am against them totally,
because I never do anything partially. If an enlightened man – one who
is alert, awake, conscious of reality – can do things like Krishna or
Mohammed or Jesus did, then I don’t want even to be enlightened
anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed married nine wives. It is criminal – the wives are not human
beings, they are just cattle. But Mohammed is nothing compared to
Krishna, who had sixteen thousand wives. And these were</p><p><br></p><p>not women who had fallen in love with him: otherwise, I have no
objection to it. These women were already married to somebody else. They
were hijacked, forcibly taken away from their children, from their
husbands, from their families.</p><p>Sixteen thousand women? But a perfect incarnation of God cannot just
have one wife like an ordinary man! I don’t think that he could have
even remembered the names of sixteen thousand women. And I don’t know
whether those sixteen thousand women made love to Krishna. If it
happened, he must have been the most spent man in the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>Even one woman is more powerful than man as far as her capacity to
have sexual orgasm is concerned. A woman can have multiple sexual
orgasms. A man is very poor in comparison, he can have only one – that
too is not necessarily an orgasm, because for the orgasm to happen you
need a little time, a little foreplay. You need to not be looking at
your watch while making love.</p><p>But everybody is in such a hurry, without knowing where they are
going. You are only concerned whether you are going with the topmost
speed or not. Within seconds, the man’s love is finished. He turns to
the other side and goes to sleep and starts snoring, and leaves the wife
weeping and crying, because it has not even started and the man is
finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Sixteen thousand women? – a sure way to commit suicide. No, I cannot
do that. And don’t think that this must be simply mythological, it is
not. It is a historical fact. I used to think it must be just
mythological, but when I went to Hyderabad, a Mohammedan state in India,
the Nizam of Hyderabad – the king of Hyderabad state – had five hundred
wives in the twentieth century! I told the Nizam, “It is good I came
here, met you and came to know about your five hundred wives. Now I can
believe in Krishna and his sixteen thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sixteen thousand are only thirty-two times more. And if it can happen
in the twentieth century, then five thousand years ago you can think
anything is possible. Man is still so superstitious; how much more
superstitious must he have been five thousand years ago. But this was a
certificate... because it is written in the Hindu scriptures, “When God
comes on the earth, he will have sixteen thousand wives.” The scripture
has to be fulfilled; only then will you be recognized by people as the
complete incarnation of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Because Rama, another incarnation of God, had only one wife, he is
thought to be a partial incarnation – just a little bit of God in him.
Strange, I think... is it the quantity of women that is used as a
criterion of how much godliness is in you? Then I don’t want this type
of godliness. The woman is not a measurement. The woman is just like
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever thought about the word “woman”? It simply means a man
with a womb. She has something more than you. If it is to be decided who
is more, then the woman is more: she is a man with womb. And a womb is
not an ordinary thing; it is something of immense value, because all
life comes out of the womb.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has always felt inferior to woman. Because he has felt inferior
to woman, he has tried in every way to repress woman and make himself
superior. It is a simple logic: only the inferior man wants to be
superior. The superior is already superior, there is no question of
wanting it. Unless man frees woman completely from all bondage –
religious, political, social – he will never get rid of his own
inferiority complex.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom of woman is going to be the freedom of man too. It is not
only woman’s liberation, it is as double-edged liberation. And science
has given you all the means to be liberated now. The greatest revolution
in human history, after the discovery of fire, was the pill. That makes
you equal, unafraid of getting pregnant, unafraid of becoming dependent.
And sex loses all the stupid ideas around it; it becomes simple, fun –
neither sin nor virtue, but simply fun.</p><p>I am the beginning of a totally new religious consciousness. Please
don’t connect me with the past. It is not even worth remembering. It
will a great blessing to humanity if we burn all the past histories,
destroy the whole past, and give man a fresh beginning, unburdened. Make
him again Adam and Eve, so that he can start from scratch – a new man, a
new civilization, a new culture.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>My God! My business? I am busy without business.</p><p>I have heard.… One Sunday morning a hippie-type young man with long
hair entered the biggest church of New York. It was very early; the
people of the congregation had not started to come, but the bishop was
there. Looking at this man, he asked, “Who are you? And what is your
business to be here?” The hippie-type person laughed, and he said,
“Can’t you recognize me? I am Jesus Christ.”</p><p><br></p><p>And of course, Jesus Christ must have looked like a hippie – there is
a similarity. Perhaps he was the first hippie. It is no coincidence that
hippies go on turning into Jesus freaks; they have found the way.</p><p>The bishop got a little puzzled because he had never imagined in his
life that Jesus Christ is going to appear in his church one morning.
Now, how is he supposed to behave? He immediately had a long phone call
with the pope. He said, “I am puzzled, confused, I don’t know what to
do. A man here says he is Jesus Christ. And he says that he had promised
to come back, and he has come back. What am I supposed to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope was puzzled. For a moment there was silence, and then the
pope said, “The most I can think of is, look busy. Who knows, he may be
the Lord. Just look busy. And by the way, inform the police too.”</p><p>I don’t even look busy. I am just doing nothing, and spreading this
infectious at-ease to everybody. My whole message is: Sitting silently,
doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself. You cannot call it a
business. But in the world you have to give some name – then I can call
it a great show business.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, from my very childhood I wanted to create a big circus. And
it has happened; I am running the biggest circus around the world!</p><p>I take life nonseriously.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a circus, it is a carnival.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice!</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus says rejoice, those words do not sound right on his lips.
Just look at his face – so British, so long, as if he has always been on
the cross, crucified. He is so serious that there exists not a single
description or any picture or any statue in which he is smiling or
laughing. He was a serious businessman.</p><p><br></p><p>I am utterly nonserious. I don’t care whether this circus continues
or stops; it does not matter. To</p><p>me, what mattters is this moment. This pause between me and you is
the bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying don’t work, I am saying transform your work into
worship. Transform whatsoever you are doing into art, into music. Let it
be a dance, not a burden and a duty. Let it be love, not marriage.
Marriage is a serious affair; business people do it, with all the
business considerations – financial, educational, social status. These
are the considerations for marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>Love can even fall in love with a wildflower. Love is not serious, it
is sincere; it is truer than anything in life. But all other religions
have been doing business, great business, and doing it seriously. All
their so-called missionaries are nothing but salesmen. In their
theological colleges they are taught for six years nothing but
salesmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of one person, Erhard, who created a little stir called
EST. In the beginning the word “EST” meant Erhard Seminar Training. But
later on, he found out from somebody that in the Greek language, EST
means “is.” Then the meaning changed, he dropped the old meaning: he
started talking about “is-ness.”</p><p><br></p><p>But before he started EST he was a salesman of dictionaries and
encyclopedias. That is one of the most difficult jobs, to sell
encyclopedias. Who wants encyclopedias? And even those who have them,
they keep them just so that their drawing room looks a little literate;
nobody turns the pages of the encyclopedia. And they are costly: thirty
volumes, thirty-two volumes, thirty-six volumes – they cost a
fortune.</p><p><br></p><p>This man selling encyclopedias was successful. He thought, “Even if I
go on selling encyclopedias my whole life, how much am I going to get?”
He gave it a little serious thinking, and he said, “If I can sell
encyclopedias, why not do the real serious business of religion? Why not
give people something which doesn’t exist – growth. Growth is just an
American name for God.</p><p><br></p><p>People are fed up with God; enough is enough. They don’t want to
think about God. But growth? – they immediately become interested. Just
two weekends for two hundred and fifty dollars or so, and growth happens
to you. In fact he left all other competitors far behind. Esalen started
dying because the people were going to Erhard.</p><p><br></p><p>And you must know that Erhard is not his real name. The name sounds
German. Whenever you want something to sound solid, real, a German name
is good; it is just like steel. He is a Jew. He must have thought, “Who
is going to get this commodity of growth from a Jew?” From the very
beginning they will become suspicious, doubtful. A Jew selling growth?
Jews have been selling</p><p><br></p><p>all kinds of things, but about religion they have been failures. They
missed the biggest business when they crucified Jesus. They repent; they
don’t say it to anybody, but they know they missed the greatest
business.</p><p>Nobody is going to purchase growth or such phony ideas from a Jew. He
changed his name into a German name – solid, it makes sense. Then this
man started teaching people other things. Once the business started
moving he started bringing new commodities in: relationship, friendship,
and all kinds of “ships.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had escaped from his own home, leaving his wife and children, old
father, old mother– who were all dependent on him. And he is teaching
other people how to relate, how to make your love flower, how to be an
authentic individual. But now everything has become known about him, and
EST has died.</p><p><br></p><p>If you become aware of all the religions and what they have done to
man, there will be no need to kill them. Just a kick, a good kick, and
the pope is gone. They are already dead, they just need a kick; they
will fall down of their own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>You can call that my business. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THE THIRD WORLD WAR? IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN OR
NOT? WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO PREVENT IT?</p><p>Don’t do anything to prevent it, because this humanity that you see
around the earth is not worth anything. A good third world war will at
least clean this planet of human garbage: cathedrals, temples, mosques,
White Houses where only lies are manufactured. Perhaps that’s why it is
called the White House – because we know the phrase “white lie.” Lies
are always white; they have to be painted white.</p><p><br></p><p>All these politicians, with no awareness, no love, and with all the
nuclear weapons in their hands.… The world right now contains so many
nuclear and atomic weapons that this poor humanity can be killed seven
times – although that is not needed, once is more than enough. And they
go on piling them up.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not a pessimist. I am saying it to you just to emphasize the
fact that it is not a question of the third world war, it is a question
of a change in human consciousness. You cannot prevent the third world
war with the same mind as human beings have today – and there is no need
either. But human consciousness can be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>You can become the beginning of a new mankind. And the very newness
of your consciousness will be contagious. If sannyasins go on growing
around the world as they are growing, there is every possibility there
will be no third world war. My sannyasins are not politicians. My
sannyasins have no political aspirations; only idiots have those kind of
aspirations – chimpanzees and others.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins are learning to live right now, intensely, totally,
burning the torch of life from both ends together. If you can make the
people around the world dance and sing and celebrate You</p><p>may not see the connection between the third world war and what I am
saying, but there is a great connection.</p><p>The third world war is possible only if humanity feels suicidal, if
people lose all interest in life and become so frustrated that they
don’t want to live – for what? For Ronald Reagan to become the
president? For Ethiopia, so that thousands will die every day? For
India, which goes on producing children? The Indian woman is
continuously pregnant. Half of India is starving; soon it will be a
second Ethiopia, far bigger. If you cannot manage Ethiopia, it is
impossible to manage India. And the same is going to happen to other
third world countries.</p><p><br></p><p>What is there to save? – your football matches? the Olympics? What is
there in people’s lives? They are living empty, hollow lives. In fact,
the third world war is coming closer and closer because people are
feeling more and more hollow, without any meaning. They will certainly
be happy that the whole world is finished. But if we can create a little
joy in people’s lives, a little silence, so that what they think of as
hollowness is no longer hollowness; it is serenity, it is silence, it is
emptiness, but intensely full, overflowing with joy.…</p><p>I don’t have any dogma, any creed, any cult to spread. I want you to
be carriers of joy – in small things. Life does not consist of big
things.</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander the Great is just a fool. You have another fool in America
– Muhammad Ali the Greatest. There is nothing big in life, because
nothing is small either. There is no question of thinking in terms of
great, not great. There is no need to think in terms of mundane,
spiritual; materialistic, spiritualistic. All these divisions are false.
Life is one single whole. It is material, and at the same time it is
spiritual. It is mundane, and at the same time the holiest thing
possible.</p><p>If you can become the carriers of my at-ease – that is just the word
I have invented against dis-ease</p><p>– if you can do this.… And it is not much, just rejoice in small
things: a cup of tea sipping it, feel blessed, because who knows?
tomorrow moring you may not be there, the third world war may have
happened. When you go to sleep, say goodbye to the stars and to the
universe, because who knows at what time Ronald Reagan may go berserk.
When you wake up in the morning, greet it. Greet the sun, greet it the
way the birds are greeting it with their songs, greet it the way flowers
are greeting it by releasing their fragrance.</p><p>Dance! Don’t be bothered that you will be thought crazy. Once you are
my sannyasins you are crazy. And craziness gives such great freedom that
the so-called sane people cannot even understand. You can dance for no
reason at all. You can laugh although no joke has been told to you. You
can do anything, because you are a recognized crazy man.</p><p>Why have I given you this red uniform? So it will be recognized:
“This man is crazy. He talks to himself, he laughs when there is nothing
to laugh at. Watching the sunset, we have seen tears of joy flowing from
his eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave you the mala with my picture to be certain; I don’t want to
take any chances. I want you to be</p><p>recognized in the world as the craziest people around. And slowly you
will be surprised: the people</p><p><br></p><p>who call you crazy will become curious. They also want to laugh, but
their mouths are tightly closed by the society. They also want to dance,
but their culture does not allow it, or allows it only in certain
situations, certain occasions.</p><p>In my childhood I was very much interested in going to the
crematorium. Anybody dying in the city... I was always going. Whether I
knew the man or not was not the point. My father asked me, “Are you
crazy? That man was a beggar. Why did you go with him and waste your
time?”</p><p>I said, “I have become immensely rich going with the people carrying
a dead body to the crematorium. I have seen many things which I would
not have seen. I have seen that the body they are carrying, and the
people who are carrying it, both are dead. It was a shock in the
beginning.</p><p>“And I have seen these people The body is on the funeral pyre, and
they are sitting around it far</p><p>away – because the fire creates so much heat, particularly in India –
talking about film actresses. Somebody is looking at PLAYBOY others are
gossiping about people who are not present there, telling all kinds of
lies, but nobody is concerned with the person who has died. In fact,
whatever they are doing is an effort to create a barrier between them
and the burning body. Nobody is thinking that one day their body will be
on the funeral pyre and people will be reading PLAYBOY. They don’t want
to see it; it is escapism.”</p><p>One of my teachers died. He was a funny man, very fat, and he used to
have a very ancient type of turban – very big, maybe thirty-six feet
long or more. Thirty-six feet is normal for the old, ancient turban. His
face was also such that you could not remain looking at him without
smiling. And he was my Sanskrit teacher.</p><p>He was a simple man – in fact a simpleton. We had been playing all
kinds of tricks on him, and he was never able to find out who had done
it; he never punished anybody. We had been really hard on him. He would
fall from the chair, because we had managed to cut the legs of the chair
before he came. He would fall from the chair, his turban would fall all
over the class, and there would be great laughter. But he would start
putting his turban back on and writing on the board again, not getting
disturbed. He was really a nice fellow.</p><p>He died. We used to call him Bhole Baba. That was not his name. Baba
is simply used for grandfather, a respectful word. Bhole means a
simpleton, so innocent that anybody can deceive him. I have completely
forgotten his name, because we never used his name; we always used Bhole
Baba. I have been trying to figure out what was his real name, but I
cannot find it anywhere in my mind.</p><p>When I went to his house with my father, his wife came running from
inside the house, fell on the chest of that poor fellow, and said, “Oh,
my Bhole Baba!” I could not contain my laughter. My father tried telling
me, “Keep quiet!”</p><p>I said, “The more I try to keep quiet, the more it is becoming
difficult. I cannot contain it; let me laugh!” But everybody was
shocked: somebody is dead, and you are laughing so loudly. I said,
“Please, don’t be shocked. If you knew the whole thing as I do, you
would all be laughing.”</p><p>And I told the whole thing, that he was always getting irritated by
being called Bhole Baba. And we used to write on the blackboard every
day, “Welcome, Bhole Baba”. And the first thing he would do was, he
would erase it. And now the poor man was dead and his own wife...</p><p><br></p><p>When I told them this, everybody started laughing. And the wife also
became silent and said, “It is really strange for me to call him Bhole
Baba, because I used to tell that boy not to call him Bhole Baba, that
it is not his name.”</p><p>And who was the boy? Mostly I was the boy who always going past his
house, would knock on the door and say, “Is Bhole Baba inside?” And the
wife knew me. With the door closed she would say, “No, he is not inside”
– he was always inside – “But remember, don’t call him Bhole Baba! If
you stop calling him Bhole Baba, I can open the door and you can find
him inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps continually hammering, “Bhole Baba, Bhole Baba,” then at the
moment of death<span class=s6></span>Of</p><p>course, a Hindu wife is not supposed to say her husband’s name. She
cannot, that is thought to be disrespectful – just the male chauvinistic
mind. The man can call her by her name, but the woman cannot call her
husband by his name. So perhaps... there was no time to figure out what
to say; Bhole Baba came in handy.</p><p><br></p><p>But even the wife started laughing, thinking that this was really
hilarious. “My whole life I have been telling you and other boys who are
your friends... who you have been telling that whenever they pass the
door, they should knock and enquire, ‘Is Bhole Baba inside?’”</p><p>The death became a laughter. But back home, my father said, “I am not
going to take you to another</p><p>death, another cremation – not with me, at least. What you have done
is not right.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Everybody laughed – even the wife who was crying, started
laughing. You should all be</p><p>grateful to me that I made even death nonserious, fun, a joke.”</p><p><br></p><p>If my people go on being nonserious, laughing, dancing, singing, not
finding any reason for it – life is enough reason for it – we can make
the whole world aflame with laughter. Nuclear weapons can be destroyed
by a laughing, smiling, dancing humanity. But as humanity is now, there
is no hope.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the only hope! So don’t keep your joy to yourself, spread it,
make it available to anybody. Don’t even think whether he is introduced
to you or not. Don’t be British, be human! These are the only two kinds
in the world.</p><p>The third world war can be completely stopped – should be stopped.
But it is not going to be stopped by the pacifists and their processions
and their screaming and shouting for peace. They are not the people to
stop it. They are really showing by shouting and screaming that they are
not peaceful men. They may be pacifists, but they are ready to fight for
it!</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a pacifist, I am at peace.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never participated in any protest of any kind. I have never
been a part of any organization of any kind, and I would like you not to
be pacifists, but peaceful, radiating your silence around you. It is
invisible but it stirs hearts. Radiate your love – not even to your
wife, which is the most difficult thing, so I am leaving it for later
stages. Radiate your love – not even to your neighbors, that is too
difficult. Radiate to strangers.</p><p><br></p><p>Start radiating your being to a tree. Hug it. Have you ever hugged a
tree? If you have not hugged a tree you have missed something of
grandeur. If in a silent, deep, peaceful moment you hug a tree,</p><p><br></p><p>you will find it is not a one-sided hug; the tree is responding. And
the response is so tangible, that the tree is happy. Dance, and the tree
will also rejoice with you; it may become greener, may bring more
flowers.</p><p>Have you not watched this happening to this desert, this Big Muddy
Ranch? When I came here it was really a sad place: no flowers anywhere,
no trees except the juniper. The juniper seems to be German. And those
junipers were also very few, not thick, somehow surviving like human
beings, at the minimum. Now, after just four years of our being here –
and we have not done anything to those junipers – they are greener,
thicker, bigger. You can feel their joy.</p><p><br></p><p>We have changed the desert into an oasis. And soon the whole Muddy
Ranch will be green. Your laughter is nourishment even to the trees.
There were no birds when I came here, not a single bird. Now birds have
started coming. Life is such an organic whole. In my garden there must
be nearabout eighty peacocks. Near my house we have made a small river
out of rainwater. There are beautiful swans.… Your joy, your love, your
peace does something without your knowing to everything that is around
you.</p><p><br></p><p>So I cannot say, “Go and become pacifists. Take the flags and the
banners and go to Washington or to Moscow and scream against nuclear
weapons.” Nobody is going to hear you. Those politicians are deaf; those
politicians are just dodos. That is not going to help. But doing
something totally different, which has nothing to do with the third
world war<span class=s6></span>That’s why I said, “Please don’t try
to</p><p>prevent it,” because that would be directly making an effort to
prevent the third world war. You cannot do it; things have gone too
far.</p><p><br></p><p>The third world war is the conclusion of all the religions and the
politicians and all the cultures of the past. It is a logical
conclusion. It is only a question of time – and the time, too, is not so
much. Things are moving. The way they are moving, before this century
ends, the world will be finished.</p><p>But you can help the world to continue. I am not concerned with the
war directly, I am concerned with something else, some other energy as
an antidote. Be meditative, be loving, be silent, be sharing – and
spread your craziness.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon the same people will start doubting their sanity; you just have
to go on spreading your craziness. It takes a little time to hammer the
fact, but the so-called sane people will not be incapable of seeing.
What is the point of being sane if you cannot love, you cannot dance,
you cannot sing, you cannot even whistle? What is the point of being
sane? They will say, “Let this sanity go to hell, or to Oregon, but we
are no longer going to be sane. We are going to be human, alive,
thriving, so full of life that it starts touching others and
everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you know it by your experience. What I am saying is not giving
you a belief, it is your experience too. Just don’t be miserly and hoard
it. Remember the law of existence: the more you give, the more you
get.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>23</span></p><p><br></p><p>Persecution cannot do any harm to you</p><p><br></p><p>2 1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE WAY YOU WALK, IT SEEMS AS IF YOU ARE DRUNK. WHAT IS THE
TRUTH?</p><p><br></p><p>Man, I am drunk! But not drunk with ordinary alcohol, marijuana,
hashish, opium, LSD. I grow my own marijuana within me. No government
can interfere with it. My source of drunkenness is my silence, my love,
my centeredness, my rootedness in myself. Yes, I walk like a drunkard
because I am a drunkard. You have observed truly.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know the inner serenity, a gap between you and your body
arises, a gap between you and your mind arises. That creates my bobbily
walking. Nothing can be done about it. It is not a medical question, it
is natural to anyone who is enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Mostly enlightened people die immediately after enlightenment, for
the simply reason that they cannot manage any connection with their body
and mind. It is very rare that somebody goes on living after
enlightenment. But one has to compromise.</p><p>That bobbiling is the compromise. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>MOST PEOPLE, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, EQUATE DEMOCRACY WITH THE FREEDOM TO
CHOOSE THEIR POLITICIANS, YET YOU SEEM TO ENVISAGE A COUNTRY WHICH IS
BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND POLLUTION-FREE, BECAUSE YOU SEE POLITICIANS AS
POLLUTION. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?</p><p>Just the very existence of nations, countries dividing humanity into
stupid parts, is the whole game of the politician. And this I call
pollution. It is poison to humanity. That’s why you don’t see really
authentically alive people in the world.</p><p>You are asking, “People generally understand democracy to mean the
freedom to choose politicians.” Do you see the idiotic understanding of
the people? It is choosing between poisons. The bottles contain the same
poison – on one is written “Democratic,” on another is written
“Republican.”</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians have been befooling you. They have managed the whole
strategy in such a way that you never become aware what is happening.
You choose one kind of poison for five years; for those five years you
have to suffer that poison. After five years you are fed up with this
kind of poison. You change to another bottle – Republican, Liberal,
Democratic, Communist, Socialist. They are all available in all shapes
and sizes, whatsoever suits you. But you will fall in the same ditch.
Maybe there are minor differences between poisons, but poison is
poison.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not see democracy as the freedom to choose between the
politicians. To me, democracy means there are no longer any politicians
around. You individually choose somebody you feel is the right person;
there are no political parties. In a real democracy, political parties
cannot exist; there is no reason why they should exist. People are
intelligent enough to choose on their own. The politician need not go
and convince the people, “I am the right person and the other is wrong.”
And the other is also doing the same, and the poor people in their utter
confusion somehow choose somebody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never voted in my life, for the simple reason that all those
politicians and political parties are basically the same. They want to
exploit you, oppress you. And it is a good strategy that after five
years when you get fed up with one party, you can choose another.</p><p>People’s memory is not very strong. So for five years it is the
Republican party sucking you, doing everything that is wrong, deceiving
you and the whole world. After five years, it is the Democratic party
doing the same thing behind a different label. And when for five years
the Democratic party is ruling, you get fed up with them, and you forget
completely that those Republicans had done the same before. Five years
is enough time for people to forget. And you go on moving between two
parties.</p><p><br></p><p>There may be more parties in other countries, but basically two
parties are in a deep conspiracy against the people: “Five years we
exploit them, then we will give you five years to exploit them. And
again we will come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>In a real democracy what is the need of political parties? The real
need is to make people more alert, more intelligent, so they can choose
individually, not impressed by propaganda.</p><p>And what small things impress you! Why was Nixon defeated by Kennedy?
You will be surprised and shocked, because it will prove to you how
idiotic you are: It was the television that made the</p><p><br></p><p>whole difference. On television, the supporters, the advisors of
Nixon, had insisted that he wear dark clothes “so your figure comes out
clearly, strongly, because millions of people will never see you in
person; they will only see you on the television.”</p><p>Nixon did not listen to them. He came in a gray suit, and that
decided his defeat. Kennedy came in a dark, black suit. When they were
together you saw that Nixon looked gray, weak, while Kennedy looked
clear, strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Television has changed almost the whole political phenomenon. Before
television, you were coming in contact with the real person. Now when
you come in contact with a person, experts have decided his hairstyle,
make-up, the color of his clothes. They have taught him how to walk, how
to stand, how to look exactly into the eyes of the people; what to say,
how to say it, when to make a gesture with his hand; when to almost
shout, and when to almost whisper. Now it is in the hands of the experts
to program him.</p><p><br></p><p>Nixon was not ready for it, and I think any man who has any sense of
integrity will not agree to all this nonsense. He is not an actor. But
Kennedy followed the advice of the advisors. He came on the television
very strong, very clear, standing the way a strong person stands,
speaking the way a strong person speaks. He was chosen. It has nothing
to do with politics – just two poison bottles, but one has a beautiful
container, more modern. The other is an old container, out-of-date.</p><p>Nixon looked lousy on the television. That decided his fate, and also
made him learn that television has changed the whole situation. The next
time he came like an actor, played his role well, and was chosen. And he
proved to you that he was a poison.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very strange, nobody assassinated Nixon. Kennedy was
assassinated. Then his brother, another Kennedy, was assassinated
because he was also fighting to become the president of the country. And
now the third brother, the last brother, is being threatened: if he
tries to become the president, he will be gone the same way the two
others have gone. You call this country democratic?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, in the constitution it may be written that everybody has the
right to run for any office, but the third Kennedy is being threatened,
and he knows that the people who are threatening him mean business. His
mother is very old – ninety years old; he had to listen to her. She has
suffered her whole life. She has lost two of her sons and she does not
want to lose the last one; otherwise the whole family tree will be
destroyed. She has taken a promise from the third Kennedy that while she
is living he will not run for president.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this politics or mafia? Is this democracy? It is not. The only
difference between a communist country like Russia, and America, is
superficial. In Russia, one party rules forever. In America, they give
you a chance to choose which political party you want to be exploited
by. But what is the difference? – you are going to be exploited. The
exploiters go on changing, but the exploitation remains the same. What
does it matter? One party exploits you forever, or two parties make a
pact and in rotation they exploit you? But your exploitation is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>My concept of democracy is people deciding on their own, without any
political propaganda from anybody. Choose the candidates you like. In
fact, the candidate approaching the people and asking, “Please choose
me,” is ugly, disgusting. If he is of any worth, people should reach him
and ask him, “Please take this responsibility for us. We want you to be
in the parliament.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then a different quality of people will be coming into the assemblies
and the parliament, people who will not have any political leadership of
the party, its program. They will be free individuals acting out of
their intelligence. They can choose the president, the prime minister –
anybody. And they will be deciding on every issue according to
themselves. People have given them immense respect by sending them to
the government; they cannot be exploiters.</p><p>A real democracy will choose the wise people. They are all around.
But remember, a man of wisdom is not going to beg you for a vote. He is
not going to kiss your children and shake hands with you. He is not
going to act on the television screen so that he appears to be the way
you would like your president to be.</p><p><br></p><p>The wise man is not interested – in fact, he will not be inclined to
be dragged into this mess. You will have to persuade him. The whole
scene changes – not the politician persuading you, but you persuading
someone to represent you. More fresh blood will be coming into the
government.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, democracy can exist only if the countries are
dissolved. With so many countries preparing to fight with each other
continuously, of course you choose the most cunning politician you can,
because he will be safer. You want him to be smarter, more cunning than
the Soviet premier. The same is the situation in every country.</p><p><br></p><p>The wise people remain out of politics. It is so dirty, stinkingly
dirty. And it will remain dirty till nations dissolve and we have one
world where there is no question of any war, no question of preparing
for war.</p><p><br></p><p>You can divide history in two parts: one, when people are really
fighting, killing, burning people – innocent people who have not done
anything wrong to you. In fact, you don’t know whom you are killing. Or
the second part of history, when you are preparing for the next war. Of
course, a little time is needed between two wars, and if the wars are
going to be world wars, then at least ten or fifteen years’ gap is
needed.</p><p>Now we are on the verge of a third world war. Albert Einstein was
asked once, “Can you say something about the third world war?” He said,
“No, but I can say something about the fourth world war.”</p><p><br></p><p>The questioner was simply surprised. He said, “If you cannot say
anything about the third, what can you say about the fourth?”</p><p>He said, “The fourth is not going to happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>The third world war is going to finish all living beings: men, birds,
animals, trees – anything that is alive it is going to be destroyed
completely. And your politicians are preparing for it.</p><p>The world needs to be free from politicians, only then can it be free
from pollution.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need for nations? Why can’t we have the right to move
freely around the earth? This is our earth! Now I have been here for
four years, and I am still a tourist. It seems I am going to die as a
tourist. The government agencies who are responsible for deciding are in
a difficulty. If they say</p><p><br></p><p>no to me, I am going to fight the courts up to the Supreme Court.
That will give me enough time – almost twenty years. So they are afraid
to say no. Yes, of course, they cannot say. So they are in a dilemma,
just waiting for some miracle to happen. But I am not a miracle man!</p><p>But who are these men to decide? They are also foreigners, America is
not their country. Perhaps they came four generations ago and I came a
little later, just four years ago. But they are invaders – I am not an
invader. I have come to the country as a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Man should have a birthright of free movement around the earth, and
one day a birthright to move around the stars. We have to dissolve all
the boundaries and all the nonsense that exists because of these
boundaries. Anybody who divides man, for any excuse, is unforgivable.
Black and white And</p><p>what about me? – neither black nor white.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, we have a beautiful joke.… When God created man – of course
he was an amateur, he had never created before – so when he put the man
made of mud into the oven, he pulled Him out a little too soon. These
are the white men, uncooked. And it is natural – because he saw that
this is an uncooked man, next time he waited a little longer, went to
the other extreme, and when he pulled the man out, he found a Negro. He
said, “This is going to be a difficult job.” So he decided on a time
exactly in the middle. That’s why there are people like me neither
uncooked nor cooked too much.</p><p><br></p><p>But what difference does color make? What difference does sex make?
Why should woman be treated differently than man?</p><p>In China, for centuries it was thought that the woman has no soul.
Great thinkers! Great discoverers! They have not bothered about
themselves, whether they have any soul or not, but they decided
unanimously that the woman has none. She is a thing to be possessed.
Therefore, for centuries in China if a husband killed the wife it was
not murder, it was not something against the law. You could not drag the
man to the court as a murderer, because the idea was that the woman was
a thing. If you destroy your chair it is your business, if you want to
put your house on fire, it is your house. The wife belongs to you, you
can do anything to the wife.</p><p>And they did everything to the woman. From her very childhood the
Chinese girl was given iron shoes, so that her feet remained very small.
That was their idea of beauty. In fact, they crippled the woman. Of
course, her body want on growing, but her feet remained small. They
thought they looked very dainty – they were simply out of proportion.
The feet should grow in proportion to the body, because they have to
take the whole load of the body. It was difficult for the Chinese woman
to dance or to walk properly.</p><p><br></p><p>All kinds of ugly things around the world just because one is man,
another is woman. And what is</p><p>the difference between a Christian and a Jew and a Hindu and a
Mohammedan? Just their conditionings are different; otherwise, they are
exactly the same people. But they have been labeled by their
conditioning as Jews, as Christians, as Mohammedans. You are not a
thing. You should refuse to be labeled.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to rebel against all these stupidities, because stupidities
have divided the world. And divided, naturally everybody is afraid of
everybody else. Your neighbor starts doing gymnastics; you get paranoid.
Why is this man trying to become stronger? – you join a gymnastics
course</p><p><br></p><p>immediately. Seeing you – that you are going for a gymnastics
program, you have joined the gym –</p><p>the neighbor becomes afraid. He starts making better efforts, because
it is going to be a tough fight.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is happening around the world. In Pakistan they have
American soldiers. Now, it is absolutely natural for India to invite
Soviet soldiers. The American politicians say, “Expel Soviet soldiers
from India, remove them; then we will remove the American soldiers from
Pakistan.” But who is going to remove them first? Both say, “You remove
them first, because we don’t want to take the risk.” Nobody is removing
soldiers, nobody wants to remove them.</p><p>If you look clearly, the way I see<span class=s6></span>Because I
am nobody; I don’t belong to any nation, I don’t belong</p><p>to any religion, I don’t belong to any political party. I am simply
an individual, the way existence created me. I have kept myself
absolutely uninfluenced by any idiotic ideology – religious, political,
social, financial. And the miracle is that because I am not burdened
with all these glasses on my eyes, and curtains before me, I can see
clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>The world can be a paradise any moment it decides! It will just have
to drop a little crap: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, American, Russian.
Politicians will not help you to do it, they will hinder you from doing
it. Priests will not help you to do it, they will hinder you from doing
it. All their greatness – the president of America, the premier of the
Soviet Union, the infallible pope in the Vatican what</p><p>will happen to these people?</p><p><br></p><p>If you drop all your conditionings, and if you remove all the lines
from the map, you burn all your identity cards, your passports, your
visas, and you start moving around the world absolutely freely – it is
our world – what will happen to these idiots who are sitting on your
head? They will create every difficulty.</p><p>But the time has come to face the fact; otherwise, you are on the
very verge of a total global war which will destroy everybody. Before
that happens, get free of all poisons – nations, politicians, priests,
religions – and the world will be pollution-free.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not the ordinary pollution that exists in L.A.; that is
nothing. That too exists because of vested interests. A car can be
created which does not pollute the air, but what will happen to all the
manufacturers of hundreds of cars around the world? Their factories will
go bankrupt. Right now they are billionaires; they will be beggars
immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not know that many inventions which are going to help
humanity are prevented; their copyright is purchased by somebody whose
vested interest will be interfered with. And the poor scientist, if he
gets enough money, how can he refuse? There are hundreds of inventions
which have been prevented. Money has been paid, and humanity goes on
suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to declare his freedom. it is not a question of a nation
being free, it is a question of every individual on the earth being free
from all the jargon that the past has left within you.</p><p><br></p><p>The cars pollute the air but the politicians and the priests pollute
your very soul.</p><p><br></p><p>The air can be cleaned, the cars can be changed. If man is capable of
reaching to the moon I</p><p>don’t see why the scientists who can reach to the moon cannot make a
fountain pen which does not</p><p><br></p><p>leak! It seems simply absurd. Man has come to a maturity, and now
decisions have to be made by free individuals – not Americans, not
Russians, not Indians. We can make this earth pollution-free, outwardly
and inwardly.</p><p>That’s my message to my sannyasins: First, be free, and then let
others taste your freedom and the joy it brings with it. It is not a
difficult job at all. People are waiting for some savior to come and
deliver them from all this misery. The savior is not going to come, but
half of their waiting is right: they are waiting to be transformed. If
they go on waiting for the savior they are waiting for Godot, who has
never come, who will never come. They have to drop this idea that
tomorrow somebody is going to come and deliver them from their
suffering, misery. No, it is not going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to become the savior of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach selfishness, because to me to be selfish is not wrong, it is
natural. Everybody should be selfish, self-centered, not waiting for
anybody’s help. Declare your freedom individually. And that’s my
movement. You are here, not as a society, not as a community, you are
here as an individual. There is nothing higher than an individual and
his freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be a little courageous. And to suffer for freedom is not
suffering, it is a joy. To suffer for individuality is not painful; it
is a pleasure, because you are moving towards a blissful state. Just a
little courageousness – I don’t ask you for great courage. Just a little
courage, and the world can be free of politics and pollution. The world
can be free of fights, murder, massacre, burning people alive.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at history, it is so ugly. In my university, one day I
went into the history department. I was looking around and getting
introduced to all the subjects, so I could choose. And that was my last
day too, because immediately I was fighting with my professor. I told
him, “If this is history that you are teaching, then don’t poison
people’s minds. It is better they forget all about the past. Don’t go on
pouring rubbish into their heads, because then there will be no space
for the present and no space for the future.” There is no need of
history. All history is bunk!</p><p>It can happen in a single moment of understanding. That is the only
miracle I know. All other miracles are inventions or gullible people, of
stupid followers, of cunning scholars. But one miracle is part of
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see something clearly, then don’t wait for the next moment. Do
it right now, drop all nonsense.</p><p>And you will see the birth of a new man in you. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I HEARD YOU SAY THAT MOSES WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERSECUTION OF THE
JEWS, BECAUSE HE CREATED THE CONCEPT OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE. WHAT’S THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE JEWS AND US? I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSES
AND YOU, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PHENOMENON OF A RISING ANGER AND HATE IN THE
OUTSIDE SOCIETY? ARE WE, OR YOU, RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR PERSECUTION?</p><p><br></p><p>Baby, you don’t know the difference between me and Moses. If you had
that much intelligence there would have been no question at all. What do
you know about Moses? And what do you know about me? What difference do
you know?</p><p>Moses was a politician, not a prophet. He was taking his people from
slavery to find a new land where they could live without slavery. But to
convince slaves that you can be free is difficult; hence, he invented
all kinds of incentives: “It is God’s wish,” and, “I have spoken with
God face to face, and he has said to me that the Jews are the chosen
people, my people.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange, God’s people were slaves for centuries, making pyramids in
Egypt. What was this God doing all the time? His chosen people were
being murdered mercilessly, continuously beaten. It is now a
well-established fact that the pyramids are made of such big stones that
unless there were better cranes than we have, there was no possibility
of lifting them. How did they manage to move those big stones, going
higher and higher into the sky?</p><p><br></p><p>They were not managed by cranes, they were managed by “God’s chosen
people,” followed by the Egyptians with their whips, on their horses,
continuously whipping the people who were carrying the stone. And when
somebody has to choose between death and life, he is ready to do
anything. What was God doing all this time before Moses? It seems that
the post reaches God after thousands of years – a very inefficient
postal service. It must be managed by Indians – so lousy, so lazy.…</p><p>I lived in Jabalpur for many years. Katni is a small place eighty
miles away from Jabalpur. One letter came from Katni to Jabalpur in
thirty-six years! Even if the envelope had walked, it would have come
long before. By the time it reached Jabalpur, the man to whom the letter
was written was dead. So it was returned to the sender, but by that time
the sender was dead! But the postal service between God’s chosen people
and God seems to be even more lousy.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing in this whole idea of the chosen people of God.
Everybody is chosen; otherwise you would not be here. Everybody – not
only man, but animals and birds and trees – is chosen by existence;
otherwise, there is no reason why they should be there. They are,
because existence wants them, needs them.</p><p><br></p><p>Moses bluffed those poor slaves. And it is very easy. When you say to
a poor man, “You will be rewarded immensely after death, it is just a
question of a few years. Be patient and these rich people who are
enjoying here only for a few days will suffer in hell for eternity,” he
does not argue, it is so consoling.</p><p><br></p><p>When Moses said to the Jews, “You are the chosen people of God,” they
accepted it without any argument. I have not heard anybody arguing with
Moses: “On what grounds are you saying we are the chosen people of God?
Then why did we suffer for thousands of years? Why were our women raped
by the Egyptians? Why were our people killed by the Egyptians? And why
has God given only one work to His chosen people?” – to carry huge
stones, almost an inhuman job. If this is what it means to be chosen by
God, they should have refused; “We don’t want to be chosen. Now choose
somebody else!”</p><p>But poor people – slaves, hungry, starving – don’t argue; they want
consolation. They were immensely happy. They did not ask, “What evidence
do you have that you encountered God?</p><p><br></p><p>Was there any eyewitness? What proof have you got that these ten
commandments that you are bringing from God are written by God and not
by you? because they are in Hebrew. Is Hebrew also the chosen language
of God, amongst three hundred languages in the world?”</p><p>Nobody argued. In such a position nobody argues; people simply
swallow it with relish. They followed Moses out of Egypt – but soon they
became worried, because their leader seemed to be as lost as they were,
in the vast desert of the Middle East. But leaders have to go on
pretending that they know what they are doing: “You simply believe us,
you follow us.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took Moses forty years to reach a place, Israel – which is not
much of a place. If he had encountered God himself, if he had had that
clarity of consciousness, he should have moved just in the opposite
direction, towards Kashmir – which can be called a paradise on earth.
But Israel and the whole surrounding area is just desert. If he had had
any insight and the extraordinary powers of a prophet, he would have
chosen the countries which have oil – Israel has no oil. Then perhaps
Jews would have been the richest people in the world, just as Saudi
Arabians are today. And Saudi Arabia he had by-passed.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you know about Moses? He was lying, purely lying to his
people, pretending that he knew where the holy land was. And why did he
stop at Israel? Had he found the holy land? No, but he was getting old,
his people were dying of starvation, dehydration – no water, no food.
Only one-third of the people survived; two-thirds had already died in
this search for the holy land.</p><p>And the one-third that survived were almost of a different
generation. There was a great gap between these people and Moses. These
were small children when the journey started, the search for the holy
land. They had no idea of the slavery of Egypt, they had no idea what
had been happening to their race for centuries, they had no idea whether
this Moses had really encountered God or was just a pretender.</p><p>The new generation and the generation gap begins with Moses and the
Jews. You will be surprised to know that Moses felt so frustrated that
he himself escaped from Jerusalem. Of course, he found an excuse. He
said, “One of our tribes is lost somewhere in the desert, and I have to
find them.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was true. A few of the Jews, seeing the situation, had turned in
the other direction – that is natural logic: “If this direction goes on
and on into desert, perhaps going in the opposite direction we may find
good land.” And these are the people who live in Kashmir now. They are
Jewish, forcibly converted by Mohammedans to follow Mohammedanism. Moses
finally reached Kashmir. He was very ancient at that time; he could not
live much longer, and he died in Kashmir in India.</p><p>A great coincidence: Moses died in India, Jesus died in India, Buddha
died in India, Mahavira died in India, Krishna died in India. The
founders of almost all the great religions of the world were either born
in India or at least managed to die in India. Just to disconnect myself
from all that rotten lot, I left India. It was not in my hands not to be
born there, but it is in my hands to be assassinated in Oregon.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you know about Moses? And what do you know about me? You know
nothing, so please be clear about it. Yes, your question is relevant.
Moses is responsible for the persecution of Jews down the centuries,
because he declared them to be, and convinced them that they are, the
chosen</p><p><br></p><p>people of God, that they are born higher than anybody else; all human
beings are lower than them, they are a superior race. Or course, the
implication is clear: they are here to rule, not to be ruled. They are
here to dominate the whole world, and not to be dominated.</p><p>This idea made them fanatics, and naturally, anybody claiming
superiority over everybody else creates persecution. They have been
persecuted down the ages; they are still being persecuted. Moses is
responsible. He implanted that idea, and these poor people have carried
that idea for three thousand years. It is very difficult for them to
drop it. The Jewish nose keeps itself higher than that of anybody
else.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me: if my people are going to be persecuted, who is
going to be responsible – I or they? My whole effort is that whatsoever
I am doing I am responsible for. If I am persecuted and assassinated, I
am responsible for it. But if you are persecuted and assassinated,
remember, it is your responsibility, not mine. Why in the first place
did you join me? I will not allow you to shirk away from your
responsibility. I will not take your responsibility on myself.</p><p>I am responsible for whatsoever I am doing, and whatsoever happens to
me. You are responsible individually – because I don’t believe in any
collectivity. Every individual has to accept his responsibility for
whatsoever he is doing, whatsoever happens to him.</p><p><br></p><p>I had started alone. Then people started coming by and by, and my
caravan started becoming bigger and bigger, and now it is all around the
earth. But those people I respect. They have joined me on their own
decision; I have not persuaded anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have not given you any promises of a holy land. I have not given
you any incentives after death. I have not given you any guarantee that
if you are with me, soon you will be with God. I don’t give you
promissory notes, and I don’t take any responsibility on your behalf,
because I respect you. If I take the responsibility on myself, then you
are slaves; then I am the leader and you are the led.</p><p><br></p><p>No, I am not the leader, and you are not the led. We are fellow
travelers. You are not behind me but by my side – just together with me.
I am not higher than you, I am just one amongst you. I don’t claim any
superiority, extraordinary power, and all kinds of nonsense which Jesus,
Moses, Mohammed, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, all are to be condemned for.
Do you see the point? To make you responsible for your life is to give
you freedom.</p><p>A few of the sannyasins – for trivia, absurd reasons – have left the
caravan. I am not at all angry with them. They had joined; it was their
responsibility. They have left; it is their responsibility. If they want
to come back, it will be their responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Every single sannyasin is responsible, remember. You cannot dump your
responsibility on me. I am simply taking my own doings, sayings,
happenings on myself. If you feel that because of me you are persecuted,
drop sannyas. Why should you be persecuted for me? Who am I?</p><p>But if your sannyas is your love affair with me, then take the
responsibility: be persecuted. And persecution cannot do any harm to
you, for the simple reason that we are not fanatics, we are not
dogmatic. My people are open, vulnerable, available.</p><p><br></p><p>Some Jesus freaks come on the county road to save my people. They
take real trouble coming down to save my people, and nobody listens to
them. Or, if sometimes somebody stands there, he simply laughs and walks
away. This is a new experience for those people. Either people start
arguing with them or agreeing with them. They know those two kinds:
arguing, agreeing.</p><p>This is a different kind of species: they listen, they laugh and go
on their way. The reason is obvious: you cannot save somebody who is
already saved. Saving somebody twice is not possible – that’s why they
simply laugh at the whole absurdity of the idea. But remember, I have
not saved you. I am very clear about it: if you are saved, you are your
own savior, and persecution cannot destroy you.</p><p><br></p><p>Persecution is going to happen; it is already happening. But you are
intelligent people; you can fight the persecution through legal means in
the courts, in the Supreme Court. I have given you no dogma, nobody can
criticize you – and I have made you capable of criticizing everybody
else in the world. So what can persecution do to you? Anybody who comes
to persecute you is going to become a sannyasin! Let them come.</p><p>They are very much afraid even to visit the commune. They are
continuously talking about the commune, they are continuously talking
about me – knowing nothing, just gathering things from gossips. But
their interest is clear. Why don’t they come here? They don’t have guts
– particularly the Americans don’t have any guts. It happens when you
are rich enough and you have all the comforts of life: you start losing
guts because you become afraid – anything can take you away from your
comforts and your television.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are rumors about me that I am hypnotizing people. When I
used to go driving on the highways, sometimes I was stopped by a police
car, but the police officer would not look directly into my eyes –
afraid of getting hypnotized!</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is hypnotizing anybody here. In fact, we have a program of
dehypnosis, which exists nowhere else in the world. We are teaching our
people how to dehypnotize themselves – because the society has
hypnotized you already. What is your Christianity? What is your being
American? What is the reason for your being a Hindu?</p><p><br></p><p>Society starts hypnotizing you when you are a child and you don’t
know what is happening. By the time you are adult, you are already full
of bullshit. Now you go on carrying that bullshit as treasure. You are
afraid if you lose this bullshit, you will find emptiness within –
something is better than nothing. And you have become accustomed to the
smell of the bullshit; perhaps not only accustomed, but enchanted.</p><p>I have heard about a fisherman’s wife who used to come from her
village to the nearby, bigger town, to sell fish. One day after selling
the fish, when she was returning back home, she met one woman, a
childhood friend. The woman said, “We have just moved to this town and
it will be a great joy if you spend the night with us, and in the
morning you can go.”The house was beautiful, with a big garden around
it, beautiful flowers and their fragrance. The woman’s friend did
everything to please the guest. She put roses around her bed – the whole
room was full of rose fragrance. But the woman was tossing and turning;
she could not sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the host asked the guest, “What is the matter? Is there some
problem? Is something</p><p><br></p><p>uncomfortable? As far as I see, I have made everything as comfortable
as possible. But tell me, because I don’t want you to remain awake the
whole night.”</p><p>The woman was a little ashamed in answering the host. She said,
“Please forgive me. Just give me back the clothes and the bucket in
which I had brought the fish; unless I smell fishes I cannot sleep. And
please remove these roses, they are such a disturbance.”</p><p><br></p><p>The roses were removed, her bucket and clothes were given back to
her. She kept the bucket by her side, made the clothes damp with water,
put those clothes on her face – and then she was fast asleep, snoring.
Fish have a disgusting smell, but not to the fisherman. He knows nothing
better than the smell of fish.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult for you to drop everything that the past has given to
you and just be free. And then you will see that everything you do, and
everything that is being done to you is your responsibility. You will
never dump things on others – that is childish; that is the way of the
retarded.</p><p>Just the other day in the World Press Conference, I could not
communicate with only two people, they were from Africa. The first one
could not manage to say what he wanted to ask me. Somehow it was figured
out what he was asking. He was asking why Africans don’t come to me.
Now, is it my responsibility? Is it my business, my concern why Africans
don’t come to me? Ask the Africans!</p><p><br></p><p>They know only the smell of fish; roses are not going to satisfy
them. And I am offering roses to you, so only those who can understand
the fragrance of roses can be here with me. I am offering you the best
of everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who can understand Mozart’s music or Wagner’s music, the
people who can understand Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, the people
who can understand the beautiful poetry of Rabindranath, Khalil Gibran,
the people who can understand Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov,
Gorky, and can find the beauty, the truth in these people – they can
understand me. Then there is a possibility of communication. I was not
wanting to be rude to the poor African, but this is the truth, the naked
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>It was happening in India too. We had become an island; people from
all over the world were coming there – except the Indians. Strange, but
not really: Indians cannot understand anything which is so superior, so
delicate. In two thousand years of slavery, they have forgotten all. In
two thousand years of slavery, they have learned only how to polish the
boots of the British, of the Moguls. Now these boot-shiners cannot
communicate with me. Yes, they can hear what I say, but they will not
understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>This happened with the second African. He asked the question, and he
was looking all over the place. I was answering his question in front of
him, and he was not looking at me. Poverty, no education... Africa is
far behind. The gap is big.</p><p>When I was answering his question, he was looking all around, finding
himself in an awkward situation, because what I was saying was beyond
his grasp. And the moment I stopped answering the first question, he
immediately came up with a second question. Perhaps while I was
answering his first question he was thinking and preparing the second
question. He was not listening to me,</p><p><br></p><p>because the second question was not connected with the first question
at all. The second question was not connected with my answer at all.</p><p>If he had listened to me, he would have asked something in response
to my answer. But he must have crammed two questions, and he must have
been trying to keep remembering what he was going to ask next. And he
did not want to be disturbed by my answer! If he gets interested in my
answer, he may forget the second question. Now, what can I do if
Africans don’t come? It is their responsibility.</p><p>Scientists now have agreed on the fact that man was born in Africa.
Naturally, Africa has the biggest chimpanzees, monkeys; only those
chimpanzees and monkeys can turn into men. Indian monkeys are too small,
they won’t do. Man was born in Africa – but why is Africa so backward?
It is not only that their skin is black – because black skin has its own
beauty, as white skin has its own beauty. More important is that they
are living in darkness, in a total, black night. What has happened?</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligent people.… If man was born in Africa, the intelligent
people left Africa thousands of years ago, because it was not a land
worth living in. And the intelligent man is always searching for
something better, so the man of intelligence left Africa. Only the
retarded who were still very close to the chimpanzees remained
there.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not condemning, I have all compassion for them. I would like
them to come up and be equal to the whole humanity. But what can I do
except tell it to them? They have to take the responsibility on their
own shoulders. And the backward people are the last to accept
responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question makes you a confirmed retarded person. Drop thinking
such questions. Without responsibility you are not a real human being.
Come of age, grow up. And remember always, growing old is not growing
up. Even donkeys grow old, but they don’t grow up. Only man has the
prerogative, the privilege of growing up. Become more conscious, more
alert, more meditative, more silent, and you will see what I am
saying.</p><p>Everybody is responsible for himself. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AGAIN THIS TIME, MANY OF US FEEL THAT
YOU ARE TAKING US INTO ANOTHER PHASE OF YOUR WORK. IS THIS TRUE?</p><p><br></p><p>Absolutely true. I had to give a three year gap and remain silent for
so many reasons.</p><p>One of the reasons relevant to your question is that I had been
speaking on Jesus, on Krishna, on Buddha, on Mahavira. I was speaking on
all other traditions of religion: Hassidism, Zen, Sufism. I had spoken
on almost all important people who had contributed something to human
consciousness: Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Bodhidharma, Bokuju,
Socrates, Pythagoras, Zarathustra, Kabir, Shankara, Dadu, Milarepa,
Marpa Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu. I covered almost the whole world. Wherever
I found a man who has contributed to human consciousness, whether it was
Greece –</p><p><br></p><p>Heraclitus, Diogenes, Dionysius – or it was Tibet, or it was China,
or it was Arabia, it did not matter to me.</p><p>I was speaking on these people for a certain reason, a simple device.
I had no people of my own. I had to throw my net far and wide. When I
spoke on Jesus, Christians were happy, immensely happy; they started
coming to me. Even priests, bishops, became sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was laughing all the time inside, that what I was saying was my
own, it had nothing to do with Jesus; Jesus was just an excuse. I used
his words, but put my meaning into them. And those people were thinking,
“We have never understood Jesus rightly, we were thinking something
else.” In fact, they were right; I was changing the wine, keeping the
bottle.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I had enough people who were capable of listening to me
directly, and I didn’t have to drop things which are ugly in Jesus, ugly
in Mahavira, ugly in Mohammed... because in the beginning I was not in
the position to offend these people. To offend these people in the
beginning would have been a disaster: you would not have been here, I
would not have been here.</p><p><br></p><p>So I used those devices, and then I stopped speaking just to give a
gap – so that those who are only interested in me because I speak on
Jesus will leave. Those who think that I am supporting Hinduism by
speaking on the GITA will leave – because silence is not a discourse on
the GITA.</p><p>This was a beautiful experience. A few people left, just enough to be
counted on your fingers. But more than half a million people are now
ready to listen to me. Now I don’t care. I can call Jesus just what he
is: a crackpot. I can call Mahavira just exactly what he is: a
masochist. Now I know that you can understand me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a preparatory period. I was not thinking that I was going to
catch so many fish, but truth has its own mysterious ways. I have with
me, with great love, trust, friendliness, more than half a million
sannyasins. But that is not the whole number who are getting close to
me. There are at least two million people who are in great sympathy with
what I am saying, but they don’t yet have courage enough to come out and
declare, “I have dropped the past and I am ready for the present.”</p><p><br></p><p>And there are at least one million people who are just fifty-fifty:
they read my books, they go to church too. I know that if they go on
continuing to read my books – particularly now that I am creating the
new BIBLE and THE LAST TESTAMENT You have heard about the Old
Testament</p><p>and the New Testament; I am creating THE LAST TESTAMENT. If they go
on reading what I am saying now, things will be settled. Either they
will burn my books and take shelter in a church, or they will burn the
Old Testament and the New Testament and be my people.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now they are in a split. But I don’t see how any intelligent
person can choose – if he understands me – anything two thousand years
old, three thousand years old, five thousand years old, unless he is a
junk collector.</p><p>Yes, it is totally a new phase, because I have found my people and
now I can open my heart totally. Now all the cards are open on the
table!</p><p><br></p><p>I have nothing to hide from you, because I know your love will be
able to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>24</span></p><p><br></p><p>Go to your bathroom dancing</p><p><br></p><p>22 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT CELIBATE, I WAS SHOCKED. I GUESS I
THOUGHT YOU HAD TRANSCENDED SEX. WHY DID THIS DISTURB ME?</p><p>I was also shocked, because I was thinking you all would be shocked
and only one camel got the shock. But his question is meaningful.</p><p><br></p><p>You were shocked, Mr. Camel, because you had certain expectations of
me. It is strange – I don’t expect anything from you, and you go on
expecting how I should be, what I should do, what I should not. I am
giving you total freedom, and you want me to be a prisoner of your
expectations?</p><p>You were shocked because of the long, ancient tradition of a very
surprising phenomenon: masters have been imposing their ideas on their
disciples; in return the disciples were imposing their ideas on the
masters. And it was not that the master was really a master – because he
followed his own followers, he fulfilled their expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>If he does not fulfill their expectations all his respectability is
gone, the followers will disperse. In fact, the same people who had
respected him like a god will treat him like a dog. He will be condemned
and cursed. And your old so-called masters were not courageous enough to
remain free. What could they give you? They were imprisoned by you.</p><p><br></p><p>You both were doing the same thing. The follower was fulfilling the
master’s ideas; otherwise he would be condemned – that is clear. The
other thing is a little more subtle: the followers had certain criteria,
expectations, and their so-called masters – they don’t deserve even to
be called “so-called” masters – were fulfilling their expectations for
centuries; it was a mutual slavery. That’s why you were shocked. It has
nothing to do with my celibacy or my love. It has something to do with
your rotten mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Who are you to expect anything from me? We have no contract, no
bargain.</p><p>You are here out of your own freedom, I am here out of my own
freedom. Freedom is the only bridge between us. I don’t expect anything
from you, still, what stupidity... you expect anything from me? I should
follow your idea of enlightenment? Are you enlightened? An enlightened
man should follow the idea of the unenlightened, how he has to behave?
Do you see the absurdity of it? But the follower’s ego is fulfilled: his
master is celibate, his master is this, that.…</p><p><br></p><p>Every religion has created different kinds of expectations. The Jaina
master has to remain naked, only then will Jainas recognize him as
enlightened. I don’t see any relationship between nakedness and
enlightenment. Do you see any relationship?</p><p>The Buddhists will not allow Gautam Buddha to touch a woman, to hold
her hand and have a little dance with her, because the enlightened man
does not touch a woman. In fact, he is expected not even to see a woman.
The buddhist master walks looking only four feet ahead of him, so that
his eyes are glued to the earth. At the most he may be able to see the
feet of a woman, but not the face.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindus have their expectation. The Hindu master is not supposed
even to sit on the place where a woman has been sitting before. Even
that part of the earth has become dangerous, because the woman has left
her vibrations there, and those vibrations can destroy his celibacy.</p><p><br></p><p>All these people were fulfilling the desires of their followers. I
don’t care a bit what you expect; that is your problem. I am going to
shatter all your expectations of me. I am totally a free man. I don’t
care even about whether you think me enlightened or not. I am, why
should I care?</p><p><br></p><p>When I became enlightened I also had the idea, which has been there
for centuries, that after enlightenment one transcends sex. So for a few
days I waited for the transcendence. It was not coming; on the contrary,
the grass was greener. The women were more beautiful than ever before,
because my eyes were clear.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been traditionally understood that if an enlightened man makes
love to a woman, his enlightenment is finished. So I was a little
hesitant. But then I thought that if enlightenment is such a weak thing,
it is not worth having. How can making love to a woman destroy
enlightenment? And if it does destroy it, that means the love between a
man and a woman is a far bigger, stronger and more vital force than your
bogus so-called enlightenment.</p><p>And I am always attracted towards the unknown, untried, unexplored. I
said to myself, “For five</p><p>thousand years the enlightened people have perpetuated the idea. I
have to experiment and to see.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I have loved many women – my enlightenment has not changed. I
have created a historical event! In the future, no enlightened man
should be expected to be celibate. I have risked much. But in a way,
after enlightenment something is transcended – it is not sex, but
sexuality. After enlightenment I have not been able to look into the
eyes of any woman with sexuality.</p><p>It is nothing on my part, I cannot take the credit for it. The whole
experience of enlightenment has changed many things. Even making love to
a woman is now totally different, absolutely different, has no
connection with the love when I was unenlightened. It was not love, it
was just a biological, chemical, hormonal attraction. It was just a kind
of slavery; it was a need, and you were possessed by the need. That need
has disappeared. Now making love to a woman is just pure fun – and I
have never heard that after enlightenment fun is transcended.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, only after enlightenment can you love. Before that you were
just animals, camels. Have you seen two animals making love? Watch
carefully – you will be surprised. They both look so sad, so depressed.
A clear perception is there that they are feeling the bondage of
biology, they are feeling the slavery of biology. Animals don’t enjoy
making love. They have to do it; it is something that they cannot avoid
– they are not conscious enough. When the season comes, they have to
mate.</p><p>Man, even though unenlightened, has changed one thing: there is no
season for mating for him, the whole year he is free to love. A certain
freedom has come to humanity which is not available to the animals.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very strange to see animals: for one month or two months they
become attracted to each other and then for ten months they are
celibate; for ten months they remain enlightened! Just for two months
those poor guys, under the impact of biological forces, have to make
love. It is almost as if somebody is holding a gun behind you and
telling you to make love. The biological gun is not visible, but it is
very powerful. How can you enjoy? How can you be blissful?</p><p>No animal is happy making love. Only man has risen a little higher,
and that height has made him capable of being freed from one thing: the
biological period of mating. But still, it is biology that goes on
forcing him to make love all the year round.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, people make love only in the night. In the West, they
have a little more intelligence, they make love early in the morning –
of course they also make love in the night. The western mind has grown a
little more towards freedom. Why make love in darkness? The reason was
always because making love was a kind of enforcement, and the faces of
the lovers looked distorted. It was better not to see the faces of each
other. Not to spoil the game, the darkness was good. Under the blanket
of darkness they could manage to believe that everything was going
right.</p><p><br></p><p>It needed a little more intelligence to ask why you should remain
bounded by the night. Animals are</p><p>bounded by a certain period in the year. Man’s intelligence freed him
for the whole year.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East they are bound to make love in the night, silently –
nobody should know about it. In the West, intelligence has grown a
little better. Why in the night only? In fact, a man who is tired after
the whole day’s work, worries, tensions, anxieties – what kind of love
is he going to make? His love is more or less like a sleeping pill. It
gives him good sleep, it gives him relaxation. The whole day he was so
burdened that his heart was not functioning normally. Making love, he
loses energy; the heart starts cooling down, calming down.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is a medically-established fact that people who make love
never have heart attacks. The longer in their life they go on making
love, the more powerful, relaxed their heart remains. Have you heard, in
the millions of years of the past, that anybody has died while he was
making love?</p><p>People have died in every kind of situation. People have died eating,
people have died sleeping, people have died working, people have died
walking, people have died talking, but strange – people have never died
making love. It establishes something: that love is a relaxation. It is
good for sleep and good for your heart, but after a tiring day it cannot
be much of a joy. Just a last thing to do somehow, quickly, and then
turn your back and go to sleep – a kind of duty.</p><p><br></p><p>Morning, perhaps, is the best time to make love. Energies are fresh,
you are rested, there is no anxiety burdening you, it is the beginning
of the day. And to make love in the beginning should be considered
something auspicious, holy; you cannot begin the day religiously without
making love. But still you are in a biological bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>After enlightenment, love is no longer a need. In that way there is a
transcendence. Love becomes just like any game: playing cards, playing
tennis.… I have loved many women, and I am the first enlightened person
in the world who is being absolutely truthful to you. You could have
never found out whether I am celibate or not. I thought, although I have
not said I am celibate, you would consider me a celibate. I have not
participated in this lying positively, but negatively I am responsible.
And now I am not going to hide anything from you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Gautam Buddha’s most intimate disciple, Ananda, asked him,
“Osho, can you tell me the</p><p>essential quality of your philosophy in a very short statement?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “My philosophy is like a fist; it is a secret. I have
not told you everything. The most precious is hidden.”</p><p>If you ask me, I will say my philosophy is both hands open before
you. I am not going to keep anything private, anything secret. For the
first time, an enlightened man is trusting the people who love him. But
I would not like to be loved by you according to your conceptions, your
conditions. I don’t need that kind of love, it is poisonous. I would
like you to learn to be open to me the way I am open to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a fist, but an open hand – and not only one hand, but both
hands. And if you can love me still, then that love will be
meaningful.</p><p>It is a strange phenomenon that you have never considered. Why do you
want the enlightened man, your master, to be naked, to be celibate, to
be eating one time only in a day, sleeping on a hard bed, not allowing
women any closeness, eating only certain things?</p><p>If you see Gautam Buddha drinking even a Coca Cola, you will not
anymore consider him enlightened – he has not even transcended Coca
Cola. I don’t drink Coca Cola, but I love it. I cannot drink it because
of my physicians; Devaraj is after me, Shunyo is after me. I cannot
drink Coca Cola, I had to transcend it. But it is not enlightenment that
helped me to transcend it, it is diabetes!</p><p><br></p><p>Your old religious leaders were captives of your expectations. I am
nobody’s prisoner. And I feel very light, because I am not burdened. I
can say to you everything; there is nothing being withheld. All your
masters were withholding things from you. I do not consider them
authentic, open, sincere. Even to their own disciples they were not
true.</p><p>If enlightenment does not make you transcend hunger, thirst,
urination, then why should it make you transcend your sex? Sex is part
of your whole being, it is not something separate. You eat, you drink,
you exercise. Your body has nothing to do with your enlightenment; the
body will go on functioning in the same way. It will create blood, it
will create semen. How can enlightenment make you transcend sex? You
will have to stop eating, you will have to stop drinking. In fact, you
will have to stop breathing; only then will there be a transcendence –
in your death.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is a natural phenomenon. Yes, it takes fourteen years to make
your sexual energy mature. And if you enjoy it blissfully, without any
condemnation, without any Christ standing between you and your
beloved.…</p><p>I think this is very disgusting of these enlightened people – always
poking their nose into your affairs, always watching you from the
keyhole, what you are doing. And naturally, because they go on watching
you from the keyhole, you also go on watching them even more carefully,
because you may be following a wrong man. You have to be certain that
his is a twenty-four carat enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>It fulfills your ego that you are a follower of an enlightened
master. That’s why, Mr. Camel, you got shocked. I am sorry for you. You
are a fellow traveler of a simple, natural, authentic, open person. You
are not my followers, because to make you my followers I would have to
follow you! Then I would have to keep continuously alert that something
is not found out by you.</p><p><br></p><p>Celibacy is unnatural – at least, up to the age of forty-two. Between
fourteen years and forty-two, celibacy is absolutely unnatural, and if
you force yourself to remain a celibate, you will become just a pervert.
Your sexual energy will find ways. It is very simple.…</p><p><br></p><p>How long can you keep your bladder full? Sooner or later either you
have to rush towards the toilet or the bladder will drop any idea of
your support and will start functioning on its own. Semen is a similar
phenomenon. It is manufactured in you, by your food, by your breathing,
by your exercise, by your very living. How long can you hold it? And
holding it is such a painful job! That’s why you see your saints so
sad.</p><p>It is natural, if your bladder is full and you are afraid that, “Now
I am coming near the boundary when there will be no control<span class=s6></span>” Semen is a natural by-product of your life. Yes,
after enlightenment there</p><p>is a tremendous change. To me, that is transcendence. That does not
mean you stop making love. That simply means it is no longer a need, you
are no longer a slave to it. Just, in moments when you want to play with
the energy that you have, you can make love. And if the other person is
also of the same quality, or even is moving in the same direction, your
love will become meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>All other religions have forced you to become perverts. In your
monasteries there is masturbation but no meditation. And I want to say
the thing as it is: Transcendence simply means slavery is transcended.
Now I am not making any love to anybody, for the simple reason that I am
no longer healthy, my body is fragile. It is not ready to play tennis!
It is nothing spiritual – if I get my health back again, which I have
wasted for you.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of me for thirty years continuously wandering in India,
and in return getting stones, shoes and knives thrown at me. And you
don’t know Indian railways, waiting rooms, you don’t know the way
Indians live. It is unhygienic, ugly, but they are accustomed to it. I
had suffered for those thirty years as much – perhaps more – than Jesus
suffered on the cross. To be on the cross is a question only of a few
hours. To be assassinated is even quicker. But to be a wandering master
in India is no joke.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the healthiest person you could find. Before I started these
journeys, knowing perfectly well my health was going to be destroyed I
had to eat all kinds of food, and in India the food pattern</p><p>changes just within a few miles. I had to live with dirt,
uncleanliness, and I had to be ready for all these rewards – stones,
shoes, knives being thrown at me. And India is a vast country, almost a
continent – I was always on the train.</p><p>There are places which take forty-eight hours to reach by the train.
And aeroplanes reach only to a few capital cities. If you want to reach
the people you have to go in a train. And if you want to enter the very
central parts of the country, you have to use even worse trains. Of
course, I went on and on destroying my health, knowing perfectly well
what I was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>But what I had found I wanted at any cost – at the cost of my life –
to share with a few people, to make them afire. My body may die in the
effort, but I have made a few other bodies lighted with the same flame,
and they will go on spreading the fire around the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>People used to say to me, “Your body is like a marble statue.” It
was. My weight was one hundred and ninety pounds, and it was not fatness
– I have never been fat. It was immensely solid, like a rock. I was
never sick, I was unaware what it means to be sick. But as my body went
on deteriorating, I became aware what headache is, what migraine is,
what stomach upset is, what finally became my diabetes and my asthma.
Now I am only one hundred and thirty-one pounds, down from one hundred
and ninety.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I don’t have any energy for any game. Whatsoever energy I have
got, I want it to be devoted to you and to my people around the world. I
want to say so many things to you, and life is so short – one cannot be
certain even of tomorrow. But I am determined that death will have to
wait till I have fulfilled my task, because it is no longer my task; I
have disappeared long ago. Now it is existence meeting you, existence
trying to reach you. I am only a vehicle.</p><p>But one fact I have proved absolutely and forever– that making love
does not destroy enlightenment. On the contrary, it makes it richer,
more beautiful – new flowers in it, new colors in it, new fragrances in
it, new laughter, new smiles. The whole idea that the enlightened man
cannot make love is absolutely wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>But you got shocked because of your expectation. You are
unenlightened, you don’t know enlightenment. First, to become
enlightened is so arduous – the camel changing into the lion, the lion
changing into the child. And when you have passed this whole long track,
you are not courageous enough to do something that may spoil the whole
pilgrimage.</p><p>But, forgive me, I am a different type of man. When I became
enlightened, I wanted to test it in every fire: if it passes through all
fire tests, then only is it real. Otherwise, I was hallucinating, I was
just</p><p><br></p><p>imagining that I had become enlightened. And I can say to you now
that I have done everything that no enlightened person is expected to do
– even things in which I was not interested at all, but just to test
that I was not hallucinating.…</p><p>After my enlightenment I smoked my first cigarette. I had never had
any interest in doing such a silly thing. When you can breathe fresh air
and exhale, why should you pollute it with smoke, with dangerous
nicotine? But I did smoke, for almost one month. It was difficult, I was
coughing; it was a hard thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with one of my friends. He was puzzled; he said, “You
are mad! You were never</p><p>interested in cigarettes, and now you are smoking continually.”</p><p><br></p><p>Coughing, tears coming to my eyes, I said, “I have to see whether the
cigarette is stronger than the enlightenment. I have to give it a
chance.”</p><p>I have done everything after enlightenment which has been thought
would destroy enlightenment. And I tell you now that nothing can destroy
enlightenment, because enlightenment is not just an experience, it is a
transformation. It is not that it happens once and you see the light,
and then the whole of your life you remember with joy that vision, that
opening of the window to existence. It is not like that. Enlightenment
transforms you. You are totally a new man.</p><p>But of course, if I start smoking here while I am speaking to you,
many camels are going to be shocked. But I am an unreliable man, I live
moment to moment. If it happens to me, tomorrow you will see a table by
my side with the best cigarettes in the world – what is it?
Five-Five-Five? – and a bottle of champagne, and my Gudia, one of the
most beautiful girls I have come across, pouring champagne into the
glass for me. I can do that, it is just a question of the idea arising
in me. Then nobody can prevent me.</p><p><br></p><p>I have found freedom in dropping being respectable. Respectability is
a social strategy to keep you imprisoned. Around the world there are so
many rumors.… I don’t care a bit. Sometimes I have been told by my
friends and lovers, “Why don’t you contradict them? These are absolutely
absurd, they destroy your respectability with people.”</p><p>I said, “I don’t want to be respected by anyone, because if he
respects me he will expect me to remain respectable” – and that I cannot
promise. It is better to be notorious, because it gives you immense
freedom. I am a notorious man. Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Lao
Tzu – none of them was courageous enough to drop the desire for
respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on condemning me. The moment I come to know that they are
condemning me for a certain thing, then I go on doing the same thing on
a bigger scale. I had only one Rolls Royce. They started condemning me,
so I told my secretary, “Arrange for two.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India it was very difficult, because the Rolls Royce after 1965
became a banned item, it could not enter the country. I was the only man
who managed to have two Rolls Royces enter the country.</p><p>When I came to America, I said to my secretary, “Now there is no
limit.” I had seven, and they were</p><p>condemning me – a spiritual man, an enlightened person, having seven
Rolls Royces when people</p><p><br></p><p>are dying of starvation? Now I have ninety. Now they don’t condemn
me. They know that if they</p><p>continue condemning me, I will go on having more and more Rolls
Royces until they are satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>I have my own individuality. I don’t need anybody’s respect, because
I am so full there is no space for anything else. And it has been a
tremendous experience to be so notorious and yet to be loved by millions
of people. That gives a great hope, that even an ordinary man can be
loved; you need not to be extraordinary to be loved.</p><p><br></p><p>How much love I have received! I don’t think anybody before me has
received so much love. And certainly I have received more hostility,
anger, condemnation than anybody else. I am richest man in the world – I
receive everything!</p><p><br></p><p>Love I have received – nobody can come even close to me. Hatred I
have received – nobody can come close to me. And just for a single,
simple thing: that I dropped the idea of respectability.</p><p>If you ask me, my enlightenment made me transcend only one thing, and
that is the opinion of others. That is their business. They cannot
disturb my sleep by their opinions. And I don’t have to be concerned
about what they are thinking. I am living absolutely alone, but utterly
fulfilled.</p><p>You ask me why you were shocked – because you are still a camel. The
lions were not shocked. They must have roared! They must have found a
synchronicity between me and themselves. They must have been rejoiced
and danced: “Our master is not celibate, so we need not be unnecessarily
depressed that we are not celibate.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have reached the stage of being a child, they must have
enjoyed knowing that at least in this whole world there is one man who
can say everything truly without taking an oath that, “Whatever I say, I
will say only the truth.”</p><p>I am not one who has taken an oath to speak the truth. I simply want
you to understand what a beauty it is to be truthful, authentic, just
the way you are. I have put my heart in front of you. Now it is up to
you whether to be shocked, or to rejoice. It will depend on your mind.
But you cannot influence me; nobody in my whole life has influenced me.
Anybody who has tried has found that he was forcing me to do just the
opposite. Slowly, slowly people dropped the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, Jainas were a great majority of my lovers, but the day I
spoke on sex that majority – camels – simply disappeared. Yes, a few
remained, a few of them are even here. They proved to be lions; they
could see and connect themselves with my truth.</p><p>There were many Gandhians – until the day I spoke against Gandhi and
said that he was the most cunning politician, not only of this century
but of the whole history, that all his religion was mumbo- jumbo; it was
a curtain to dominate the whole country. And although he was saying that
he was in search of truth, he was continually lying, just like a
politician.</p><p><br></p><p>He was saying that when the country becomes free, all the armies will
be dissolved; there will be no military, there will be no weapons,
because a nonviolent country has no need of such things. One American
author, Louis Fisher, asked him, “If you dissolve all the armies and the
military, and you don’t have any weapons, and somebody attacks you, what
will you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “We will welcome them. We will say to them, ‘There is no
need for any bloodshed. If you want to live here in this country, come,
be our guests. You are welcome.’”</p><p>But this was before freedom came to India. When India became
independent, everything changed. The army was not dissolved, but
increased. The military was not dissolved – now India has one of the
biggest military forces. Weapons were not dissolved. India has atomic
plants and is now making every effort to have nuclear weapons – at the
cost of half of the country dying, without food! India is exporting
wheat to other countries, because the politicians need money to make a
nuclear plant. And these are all Gandhians.</p><p><br></p><p>When Gandhi was alive, after independence, Pakistan attacked one part
of Kashmir. India had to fight with the invaders, and you cannot believe
that Gandhi blessed the first fighter planes to go and destroy
Pakistanis – who were Indians just a few days before! Where had his
nonviolence gone? He was blessing fighting planes, sending them to
destroy the same people for whom he had been fighting for freedom his
whole life.</p><p>When I said that his nonviolence was a political strategy It was
clear that to fight against the British</p><p>government with weapons was impossible. From where are you going to
get all those weapons against the empire? – perhaps the biggest empire
that has existed ever. It was said that the sun never sets on the
British empire. It was true: if it sets in one country, it rises in
another, but as far as the whole British empire is concerned, it never
sets. This was the biggest empire of man’s history. Against this empire
how can you fight?</p><p>And not only can you not fight, you don’t have the means to fight.
You don’t have even men to fight – Indians are so lousy, so cowardly, so
superstitious, and so faithful to the idea that nothing happens without
God’s will. “It is God’s will that Britain is ruling our country. To
fight against Britain and its empire is to fight against God’s will.”
That was the Indian conditioning.</p><p>Naturally Gandhi invented a new strategy – nonviolence, which was
always respected by the Indians as the most significant religious
quality. But his nonviolence was not that of a religious man.</p><p><br></p><p>I am nonviolent. You see the guards around me with weapons and now
they are being criticized.</p><p>Remember, that criticism will create more and more guards and more
and more weapons. But I know that those weapons are just toys. Against
nuclear powers, you are carrying a small gun. I know it, I know it makes
no sense, but the gun is not the point! And I have not arranged those
guards either. I don’t know even who my guards are, what their names
are.</p><p><br></p><p>It is you, the people who love me – a person who never fulfills any
of your expectations – you are worried about my life. It is your love;
otherwise those guards are just of no use. Just a bomb will finish it
can become another Nagasaki, Hiroshima. But I am nonviolent.</p><p>People have been asking me, if I am nonviolent then why are these
weapons here? Those weapons are your love, and I respect your love,
knowingly perfectly well those weapons are toys. But I know the person
who is carrying the weapon is carrying it out of love. There is no other
reason. I cannot tell him to throw the weapon, because that would be an
insult to his love. I cannot insult love, I have tremendous respect for
love.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to come out of your shock; otherwise the bridge between me
and you will be broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember perfectly, I am not going to change in any way. If change
has to come, it has to come to you and your mind, because it is your
disturbance, your shock. It is your problem – take the responsibility
for it. See the simple fact that you were carrying some expectations –
that means some chains for me. It is time: throw those chains.</p><p>I am an absolutely free man. There is no bondage for me. I can do
anything, you just have to suggest it to me!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I LOVE YOUR VISION, BUT WHENEVER I LISTEN TO YOU SPEAKING ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF THE WORLD, I FEEL LIKE POLITICIANS AND PRIESTS ARE TOO
POWERFUL AND TOO DEEPLY ASLEEP FOR OUR SONGS AND OUR LAUGHTER TO TURN
THE WORLD AROUND. IS THIS SKEPTICISM?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not skepticism – for that a little more intelligence is needed.
It is simply stupidity.</p><p>I also know that the powers of the politicians and the priests are so
vast. What can our laughter, our song, our dances, our love, do against
these big powers?</p><p><br></p><p>I have to tell you one thing, that if an atom of hydrogen gas can
release so much energy that it becomes the hydrogen bomb, a hundred
times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima or Nagasaki,
why do you think that authentic love – which is the most precious thing
in the world – that a real rejoicing, that a total laughter when you are
not laughing but you are laughter, that a dance in which the dancer
disappears cannot release a totally different kind of energy?</p><p>All these priests and politicians have the energy derived from
matter. I am trying to tell you that if material energy can be so big,
spiritual energy can be a million or billion times bigger. It just has
not been tried, ever. This is a good opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the “opportunist” has been used always in a condemnatory
sense. I want it to be freed from that association. A really intelligent
person is always an opportunist. To me, an opportunist means one who
takes the challenge of the opportunity and risks himself.</p><p>What are we going to lose? If my sannyasins all around the world go
on spreading songs and dances and love, these politicians will look
stupid. Right now, they cannot be much bothered with the humanity that
is there. If it is destroyed, so what? – it is not worth anything. But
if we can make the earth blossom with new people, the politicians will
have heart attacks. The very idea of destroying these people, this
earth, will become inconceivable.</p><p><br></p><p>And the man of laughter, the man who can dance in tune with the wind
and the sun and the moon, is far more powerful than any nuclear weapon
can be, because his is life energy. They are playing with dead matter.
If dead matter can release so much energy, a living being... it is
inconceivable how much energy he can release.</p><p><br></p><p>We can create of this whole world a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>And I tell you, your politicians will commit suicide, because they
will be the only sad people, they will be the only ones who are unfit.
And I don’t think, howsoever idiotic they are, they can think of
destroying the laughter, the songs, the beauty of love, the innocence of
a child, and the authenticity of enlightened people.</p><p>Just take the challenge of the time. They are going to destroy you
anyway – why not celebrate before they do it? Let them create death for
the whole earth. But what are we going to lose? We will die laughing,
dancing, singing. We are not going to be like Hiroshima or Nagasaki.</p><p>In the first place, it is impossible. If we really work for the New
Man to go on spreading like wildfire, it is impossible for them to
destroy this earth. Even their conscience – which is not much – will not
allow them to destroy this beautiful garden of people.</p><p><br></p><p>And the laughter is not American or Soviet, it is not Indian or
English. Rejoicing has no nations.</p><p>Songs, dances, and disappearing into your dances and your songs,
don’t belong to any religion.</p><p><br></p><p>The New Man will declare this whole earth his own. Politicians will
simply fall by the way. They will not be able to figure out what to do
with these people. They know how to deal with the sad slaves – slaves of
theologies, political ideologies, they know how to deal with them.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is to create a man that they simply have never seen. They
will simply stagger and fall wherever they are. And I don’t see that a
world full of flowers and fragrance can be destroyed. But just for
argument’s sake, even if it is destroyed, that is the best way to go
away from this earth to some other planet – dancing, singing, rejoicing.
Yes, they can destroy your body, but they cannot destroy your spirit.
And I am trying to create a man who has spirit, ecstasy.</p><p>You can ride upon your ecstasy to other planets; rockets are not
needed. And remember, only bodies die, the soul within you is immortal.
No nuclear weapons can destroy it. You have something indestructible in
you; you just have to become aware of it, and you have to make others
aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not concerned about the future. I am concerned with you, with
people who have been given a chance of drinking the wine of life,
squeezing the whole juice of it every moment. The future makes no sense
to me, but it is going to come whether it makes sense to me or not.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not worried about myself. I died thirty-two years ago, and
the one who is speaking to you is beyond any nuclear weapon. I would
like you also to be beyond nuclear weapons. And these are the methods:
the laughter, the joy, love, rejoicing, making your life a beautiful
garden.</p><p>The last moment of your life is very decisive. Nothing is more
decisive in your whole life. The last moment of your life... if it is a
dance, you will join other dancers in some other planet. If it is love,
you will join some planet where love is no longer sin, where love is
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>So what I am saying to you is double-edged. On the one hand it can
stop the third world war; on the other hand it can take you to the right
place amongst right people. Whatever happens in the future is not my
concern. My concern is with this moment, because the next moment may be
the last moment on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this: when you go to sleep, say goodbye to life with great
gratitude. It has given you so much – never forget it. I don’t say to
you, go to sleep praying to Jesus Christ on your knees, or Gautam Buddha
or some other guy. I say to you, go to your sleep with a thankful heart
for all that life has given to you: all the laughter, all the loves, all
the beautiful flowers, the songs of the birds, the colorful rainbows,
the amazing sunsets, sunrises. It has given you so much that if there is
not going to be tomorrow you have not missed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Let there be no tomorrow; you are already fulfilled. And if by chance
you wake up again tomorrow morning, don’t start with any mantra-chanting
or prayer – these are all irreligious ways. Again, start the day with
gratitude, love, joy.</p><p>People say that you should not get out of the bed with the wrong leg,
wrong foot, because then you spoil your whole day. As for as I know,
legs have nothing to do with your day. I would like you, when you get
up, to get up with laughter. Any leg will do, but go to your bathroom
dancing!</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>25</span></p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the fact, drop the fiction</p><p><br></p><p>23 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEARN GRACE, BEAUTY, ETIQUETTE.

were not able even to see why you should respect this man. You had no
reason to respect the man, but you were forced. You were dependent, you
were too small to fight against it. That resentment is always underneath
your respect. Just a little scratching and your resentment will come up,
because it is as old as your respect, etiquette, grace. Each time you
have been trained for these things, resentment has been created in you
side by side, just like a shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>These are not things to be taught, these are qualities to be caught.
And when they are caught there is no resentment; when they are caught
they are spontaneous, natural. You don’t have to do them, they happen of
their own accord. But this has not been the case up to now. For millions
of years you have lived with a duality, a thick layer of resentment –
which is deeper, more underground – and a thin layer of forced grace,
sensitivity, aesthetics, respect, love.</p><p>The basic thing, the fundamental thing is to understand that when you
drop your grace – the learned one; when you drop love – the learned one,
remember also to drop the resentment. That too is learned. You have
learned it on your own, against all those people who had power over you.
If you don’t drop it then I can go on telling you, “Be naturally
graceful,” and you will think, “It is good, there is no need to make any
effort to be graceful.” Your thin layer will disappear – but where will
the resentment go?</p><p><br></p><p>That resentment will become your behavior. Instead of respect, you
will start disrespecting anybody and everybody. Instead of the arousal
of a natural love... the bogus love has gone, now you have only hate.
That’s why societies and cultures are afraid. They are trembling always
because they are depending on something which is not natural.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to understand that when you drop the learned thing, the
conditioned thing, don’t forget to drop with it the resentment that had
come with it; otherwise, you will become ungraceful, and to be
ungraceful is ugly. You will become disrespectful and to be
disrespectful is not human. It is falling below the human.</p><p>You have got this whole beautiful existence. You don’t deserve it;
nobody deserves it. You had not even asked for it. You have suddenly
found yourself amidst these beautiful millions of stars, the flowers,
the birds. And if you are disrespectful, you will be blind to all that
commands respect, you will turn your back to all that which commands
respect.</p><p>It does not demand. It does not say to you, “Respect me, I am your
father.” But silently have you not felt sometimes the flowers, without
saying a word, are commanding your respect, your love, your grace? And
the same applies to other human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>We are all strangers to each other. We come into the world alone, and
if you are not graceful, not loving, not sensitive, you will find
yourself in a state of loneliness, abandoned. Who cares about such a
person? That will strengthen your resentment even more, and will make
you more and more ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic fault has been made by the society, the culture, the
religion. Nothing can be done about it, except one thing, of which you
are capable: seeing the fact, drop the fiction. But always remember that
behind the fiction you have been always carrying antagonism to it.</p><p>From my very childhood I was wild. My whole family was trying to make
me cultured, graceful, respectful, but they failed. Fortunately, they
failed. I had decided one thing: that if something is natural, it will
come on its own. There is no need to learn it, to rehearse it.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, there are joint families. In one family there may be fifty
people, sixty people. Every old person in the family has to be
respected. And I know that this old guy needs to be beaten, rather</p><p><br></p><p>than respected; there is no reason why I should respect him. Just
because of his age? But then, I don’t see any relationship between
respect and age. There are trees four thousand years old, there are
animals who live longer than man.</p><p>Nietzsche has described these three stages: the camel, the lion, the
child. He has taken only the evolutionary part and described these three
stages. He has forgotten that there are exactly the same stages below
the camel – the camel is not the lowest animal in the world. Of course,
considering Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution, I say the monkey
is below the camel; otherwise there would be no man.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche is not talking about the actual camel, he is talking about
man – that he can be a camel. And if man is born out of monkeys, then
certainly the monkey will be a lower stage than the camel. And you can
easily recognize amongst yourselves how monkeyish is your behavior. That
destroys your grace, that destroys your serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Below the monkey is certainly the donkey, who is absolutely thick.
You cannot teach a donkey any tricks. Have you seen any circus where
donkeys are doing something? – impossible. Elephants are there, horses
are there, monkeys are there, but everybody has forgotten about the
donkey – such an important personality, more famous than the monkey and
the camel.</p><p><br></p><p>Donkeys are absolutely stubborn – no intelligence; you cannot teach
them anything. You can go on loading the donkey with your holy
scriptures; he will carry the weight, but will never understand the
meaning. And of course, below the donkey there is only the Yankee. And
you all know about the Yankee; there is nothing to be said about the
Yankee. You have to start from the Yankee – at least become a
donkey.</p><p>The Yankee is absolutely phony. The donkey is at least authentically
real. He may not listen to you, but he follows his nature, his instinct,
without any interference from anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>In my village there were many donkeys – of course, in every place
there are many donkeys – and I loved to ride on donkeys. In India, that
is not right. In other countries, for example in Judea, Jesus was riding
on the donkey always, it was acceptable. But in India, the donkey is
thought to be the worst kind of animal – they don’t know about the
Yankee. After even just touching the donkey you have to take a bath.</p><p>I became enchanted with the donkeys. Why should the poor animal be
abandoned? I started finding donkeys in the night, and I would ride on
them. And I was amazed to know that it is wrong, the idea that the
donkey is without intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ride on the donkey, he will never move in the middle of the
road. He will go to the sides and move so close to the walls of the
houses that your whole leg is almost crushed. It is very difficult to
keep him in the middle. Right or left – either he is a rightist or a
leftist, but never has the donkey listened to the advice of Gautam
Buddha, that exactly in the middle is the right path.</p><p>And then I recognized that they are intelligent people. To get rid of
me – he has no weapons, but he has found a way. If I see my leg being
rubbed against a stone wall, I am bound to jump off and leave the donkey
to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was trying all the donkeys of the town. Slowly, slowly they became
really acquainted with me, and then I could see even a deeper layer of
intelligence. They became aware even of my footsteps in some miraculous
way. The donkey may be fifty feet, a hundred feet away, and I would move
very slowly, very cautiously so that he did not become aware that I was
coming – but he immediately would start running. He knew my steps, he
felt in some way my presence.</p><p>Other people would be just passing by him and he was not worried. And
I was a hundred feet away, taking every care not to disturb the poor
fellow, but he would start escaping. He knew who was coming, he knew
what my purpose was. He knew there was going to be trouble, because when
I saw that these donkeys are cunning, not so dumb as people think, I
started to take them into the fields where there were no walls. Then the
donkey, of course, was at a loss. What to do? Whether he was rightist or
leftist, it did not matter; there were no walls.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I started taking them to the the fields outside the town,
they became very sensitive about my presence. Even donkeys have a
certain intelligence.</p><p>Camels, howsoever ugly they look, are very gentlemanly. And in the
deserts they are very friendly – to the point that if you are dying of
thirst, they are ready to sacrifice themselves. When in the desert a
camel is killed – because he keeps a reservoir of water inside
himself.…</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard from people who own caravans of camels that when you
kill a camel in the desert the camel makes no resistance, he simply
allows you to kill him. He is perfectly aware that this is the moment to
be of some service to you. In some unknown way he feels you have been
thirsty for days and you cannot survive unless he gives you his water
reservoir.</p><p><br></p><p>A camel can move in the desert for six weeks without any trouble,
needing no water. That much water he keeps within himself for emergency
purposes. I could not believe it, that he does not resist being killed.
I enquired, “If you kill a camel where there is no emergency or any
danger to your life, does the camel resist?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You say resist? He will kill you! He knows that there is
no need for him to be sacrificed; this is simple murder.” And a camel is
a big animal, huge, of great power, he can simply crush you under his
feet, no weapons are needed. But deep in the desert, lost in the desert,
he does not resist. That is something really to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>The camel is graceful to the point that he can sacrifice himself. He
is respectful and loving, so much so, that he is ready to die so that
you can live. He puts your life above his. He is not egocentric.</p><p>And in man you will find all these animals. I am not talking about
the real monkeys, donkeys, camels, lions, the child, so don’t get
confused. The real child is so nasty that even after enlightenment I
cannot sleep in the same room as a small child. The whole night he will
disturb you. In the day he sleeps perfectly well, but as the night comes
– of course, his sleep is over, now he is ready to torture you. He finds
excuses: “I want to go to the toilet. I am thirsty. I am hungry. I am
feeling too cold, I need one blanket more.”</p><p><br></p><p>So when I am talking about these stages, I am talking symbolically.
To me, when I say the child it simply means innocence, simplicity, no
desire for any power, no hankering to dominate anybody, and a tremendous
beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen any child who is ugly? All children are beautiful. But
what happens to all these beautiful children when they grow up? They all
disappear. They start becoming cunning, cruel, diplomatic, political.
They lose their innocence, they lose their grace, they lose their
beauty.</p><p>Amongst you, all kinds of these people are there. And it is not that
you can define somebody as the camel. In fact, in each person they are
all mixed up. Each person has all these qualities, from the Yankee to
the child.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is afraid that if you are left alone You will turn into a
Yankee, a monkey – at the most</p><p>a donkey, or perhaps if you are fortunate enough, a camel. But beyond
that your parents, your civilization is afraid. You cannot be left
alone; you have to be trained, and their training has proved poisonous.
With all good intentions they have destroyed your spontaneity. With all
their well- wishings, they have made you a hypocrite.</p><p>I am all for naturalness.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is significant, because when you listen to me say that I
am all for naturalness, you immediately drop what you always wanted to
drop. But you don’t become natural. You have forgotten the resentment.
By dropping your etiquette, by dropping your grace, by dropping your
cultivated beauty, by dropping your make-up, you are not simply going to
become natural. There is something more between your phony self and your
real self: your resentment. And you have thick layers of resentment,
because for your whole life you have resented.</p><p><br></p><p>And the resentment was yours. The grace was imposed by others – it is
easy to drop it, you always wanted to drop it – but the resentment was
yours. It is closer to you, it is more difficult to drop it. But unless
you drop your grace, cultivated beauty – just make-up; unless you drop
your nice etiquette – behavior which is just diplomatic – unless with
all this that has been forced upon you, you remember to drop the
resentment because now there is no need for resentment.</p><p><br></p><p>You are getting free of all those things which were the causes of
your resentment. You can easily get rid of things that have been forced
upon you, but the things that arose within you – there comes the real
problem. You have to drop your resentment. If you cannot drop it, the
natural flow of your energies will not be available.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been happening in all of history: many people have dropped the
forced values. Just a few years back you had hippies all around – they
had dropped the forced etiquette, the forced niceness, the forced
cleanliness. They had been told, “Cleanliness is next to God, only God
is above cleanliness.” They were forced to take baths, they were forced
to do this, that. They were forced to go to the school, to the college.
They dropped all that, but they did not drop the resentment.</p><p>Hippies did not flower into beautiful human beings. Their resentment
burned them. They went just to the opposite pole; they stopped taking
baths. Dirtiness became next to God, uncleanliness became a value. The
more unclean, the more dirty you were, the greater you were considered
to be by other hippies who were not so courageous as you were. Once in a
while they took a bath, once in a while they cleaned themselves. It
created guilt in them. Just see the phenomenon!</p><p><br></p><p>Many hippies have visited me. I felt really sorry for them. They were
going on a right path, but somewhere the path turned to the polar
opposite. Their resentment was so strong that they started</p><p><br></p><p>doing exactly the opposite of what they were taught to do. They
dropped out of schools, out of colleges, out of universities, because it
was not their own choice.</p><p>But do you know what happened to the hippies? You don’t find them.
After the age thirty-five they come back to the society, become again
what they have been taught. Their long hair disappears, their beards
disappear, their mustaches disappear. All the hippies who have reached
nearabout the age of forty are now perfectly accepted gentlemen in the
society. They are good businessmen, good salesmen, successful.</p><p>This was bound to happen. You cannot live in resentment for long; it
is a fire, it will burn you. So you don’t find old hippies – seventy
years old. You don’t find old hippies. In fact, that should have been
the case: as a hippie gets older, he should become even hippier. But
something happens by the time they start crossing the borderline of
thirty-five.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a day when hippies declared, “We do not believe anybody who
is more than thirty years old.” There was a truth in it. But you cannot
stop your age at thirty. It isn’t like a clock that you can stop at any
moment; it goes on growing whether you are a hippie or not. And by the
time they are close to thirty-five, the exact middle point in life –
after thirty-five they will start declining, their energies will start
getting lower and lower – they become afraid. How are they going to
live?</p><p><br></p><p>Then suddenly they want to be married, to have a stable life, to have
some profession, some job, some money. Old age is coming close – they
don’t want to die on the streets. It was perfectly good when they were
young, they had energy enough. That energy has been burned by their
resentment.</p><p><br></p><p>They thought they were being revolutionaries; they were not, they
were simply reactionaries. They were reacting to their parents, to their
society, to their education. Reaction is not revolution, revolution
needs much more meditative understanding. Then you don’t go to the other
pole, the other extreme; then you remain just exactly in the middle. And
only in the middle will your natural being show. But there will be a
gap. Before the natural starts flowing in you, you will have to get rid
of all the hindrances to it.</p><p>I can understand your question. You say, “It hurts to see sannyasins
becoming disrespectful.” But the commune has to be patient with any
sannyasin who is disrespectful, ungraceful, behaves in a cruel way,
talks just to hurt you. The commune has to be patient: that person is
going through a great change. Patience and help – both are needed for
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if he is not respectful to you, you all have to be respectful to
him. He needs it – this is the moment. He may not be very loving to you,
or may be even hateful to you. He is sick, he needs all your
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s the function of the commune. If five thousand people go on
pouring their love on the person who replies with hatred, how long is he
going to survive? He behaves disrespectfully, and five thousand people
don’t take any note of his disrespectfulness; they go on being
respectful to the person. Soon he will drop his resentment.</p><p>These are not the people who had forced him to do certain things
against his will. These are a totally different kind of people: you
disrespect them, still they smile and are loving and respectful to you.
They are not your parents, they are not your teachers. They are not your
old rotten society.</p><p><br></p><p>My communes are harbingers of a new man, a new world.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to be very aware, because if somebody is disrespectful
towards you, it is a little difficult to be respectful to him. But be
respectful out of love for humanity, out of compassion for your brothers
and sisters, and understanding the fact that that man is not being
disrespectful to you – he is being disrespectful to his parents, to his
teachers, to the priest. You are just an excuse. It is just a
coincidence that he has found you; otherwise, he would have been
disrespectful to somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t take it personally. Living in a commune, remember you are not
personalities. Certainly you are individuals, but don’t take anything
personally. The person is sick, he needs hospitalization. He needs more
love than anybody else, he needs more warmth than anybody else. This is
the way the commune becomes the crucible of transformation.</p><p>The sannyasins who are living outside the communes don’t have this
opportunity. If they can manage to be in the commune, they should be in
the commune, because there you have the possibility of dropping all
garbage, all your resentment, and becoming your natural self again.
There you can find your original face again.</p><p>But there may be thousands of sannyasins who cannot manage for
hundreds of reasons to be in a commune. For them I would suggest, if you
cannot be a permanent resident in a commune, at least every year make it
a point – six weeks, eight weeks, twelve weeks – to be in the commune.
Learn the flavor of the New Man. Then perhaps even in the outside, old,
rotten and dead society you may be able to protect yourself from their
rottenness.</p><p>Just the other day one journalist had asked me, “Cannot your commune
and the neighbors live in coexistence?” I simply said, “No!” I don’t
think he will be able to understand my no, there is every possibility he
will misinterpret it. But my no has tremendous implications in it.</p><p><br></p><p>It means... he was asking, “Can you sleep in the same room in
coexistence with a corpse?” It will be difficult to sleep if the corpse
is also sleeping by the side on the double bed. You may have loved the
corpse before, but now that you know it is a corpse you will be in a
nightmare, waiting for the morning, to get out of this room.</p><p><br></p><p>I said no, because the old society and the New Man cannot coexist.
The old, the dead will have to give way for the new, for the fresh.</p><p>We are not hostile towards them, for the simple reason that we are
the new, and the victory is ours! They are hostile; deep down in their
unconscious they understand that they’re dying and you are living, that
they are getting more and more rotten and you are getting more and more
juicy. They are hostile. It is natural, because they have to empty the
space for the New Man to take over.</p><p>Somebody else had asked me, “Do you intend to take over Oregon?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “No. Oregon is too small a thing. I would love to take over
the whole world.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying it on behalf of the new. I am saying it on behalf of the
sun that is rising on the horizon. And it is not just a coincidence that
I come from the East. In the West the sun is always going down, it is
always sunset. The sunset represents death; the sunrise is the beginning
of a new life.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a coincidence that all that is great, beautiful, truthful,
has arisen out of the East. India could not produce Adolf Hitler, Joseph
Stalin, Benito Mussolini – just inconceivable! India could produce
Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, Nagarjuna. We are not separate from
existence, we are very deeply connected. The countries of sunrise have
given the best to humanity.</p><p>India has never invaded any country. Such a big country could have
produced the biggest empire in the world. If England can do it – which
is just equal to a district of India, not even a state – why could India
not create a great empire? On the other hand, the greatest emperor in
India – and of course the greatest emperor in the whole history of man –
Ashoka, renounced his empire. Not only did he renounce his empire, he
sent his son and daughter as messengers of peace to different
countries.</p><p>His daughter, Sanghamitra, went to Ceylon. Now Ceylon is Buddhist –
then Ceylon was thought to be one of the most violent parts of the
world. To convert Ceylon, Ashoka sends his beautiful only daughter? He
understood human psychology: only something beautiful, something with
freshness can help those barbarians then in Ceylon. It was a risk, but
worth taking.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are not living in my communes, start making efforts to move
towards the communes. And nothing is impossible if you want to do it.
What can prevent you? What is there left in the old society? Why are you
hanging around there? You are being just as stupid as dogs are.</p><p><br></p><p>You give a dog a dry bone and he will start chewing it, and will
enjoy it very much. Nothing comes out of the dry bone, there is no juice
in it. But the dry bone makes wounds in his mouth and blood starts
coming out of those wounds. He sucks his own blood, thinking it is
coming from the dry bone.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be foolish! The society outside is just a dry bone; you will be
sucking your own blood. And they</p><p>will all be hostile to you. They will try in every possible way to
destroy your newness.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, a new plant is very fragile – you just have to put a
rock on top of it and it will disappear. And those people have big rocks
– the church, the state. They will use all kinds of means. My sannyasins
have been removed from colleges as teachers, from schools, from
universities, for no reason – just because they are sannyasins. Strange
– you don’t remove anybody because he is a Christian, you don’t remove
anybody because he is a Hindu. Why are you afraid of the sannyasin?</p><p>Their attitude makes me feel proud of the sannyasins. They are afraid
of you. The whole university may have hundreds of professors, but just a
single sannyasin and they are afraid. They know that this single man is
more powerful because he is new. The future belongs to him, not to them.
To them belongs the past, which is just a burden.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are removed from your job you will find it difficult to
survive. Your family will be against you. From everywhere you will find
antagonism. My sannyasins have been beaten on the streets. They had done
no harm to anybody, but just because they were sannyasins they were
beaten. Their malas have been taken.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to torture yourselves with those who are already
dying. There is no need to cling to the family, to the society. Perhaps
you may be helpful if you change yourself, move to the commune, and once
in a while visit the family, the friends, and let them see what has
happened to you, what is happening to you. That is the only way to help
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Parents have written to me, “We were afraid that when our sons or our
daughters became sannyasins we had lost them forever. But we want to be
forgiven by you, because when this time my daughter came back home, for
the first time we could relate heart to heart. There was no need to say
much, she was just holding my hand and it was enough.” Something
transpired between the sannyasin daughter and the old father. She would
not have been able to do it if she had remained with those old people. A
certain gap is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>You need to live in the commune to catch the fire, to become aflame.
Then once in a while, certainly go.</p><p>We are not interested in converting those dead people, because what
is the point? We will have to celebrate every night in the crematorium;
that will be too much unnecessary work. We are not interested in
converting those people, but we are certainly interested that those
whose days are gone should understand that they need not feel sorry; a
better man, a better woman is going to take their place. They can go
without any complaint. They can leave life joyously, because the people
who are going to take over will be able to manage better than they have
ever done.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years, the politician and the priest, in a deep
conspiracy, have been in power. But what have they done to you? What
have they done to the world? Monkeys remain monkeys, donkeys remain
donkeys, camels remain camels – no transformation in human beings.</p><p>It is not their fault. A camel cannot see that there is anything
better than a camel. It is just short- sightedness. And you cannot put
glasses on the camel – have you seen a camel with glasses? He will
stumble, fall down on the earth, he will not be able to make any sense
of what is happening to his eyes. The monkeys cannot see beyond
themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Those old people, even if they can understand a simple thing, that
sannyasins are going to create a better earth, which they themselves
have failed to do.… And they had enough time – thousands of years – and
they have not been able to create love, beauty, grace. All that they
have been able to do is just train you, and force you into being
phony.</p><p><br></p><p>I invite all the sannyasins of the world: slowly start moving to the
closest commune. You will find a great rhythm between yourself and
others. You will find for the first time a loving, compassionate,
rejoicing group of people, who do not expect anything from you, but who
are always ready to share with you whatever they have got.</p><p><br></p><p>Then once in a while go to the old society just to show them that you
have started flowering, just to make them aware that they need not be
worried about you. You have found the holy land, Israel. And we are
creating many Israels around the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Before true love arises in you there will be a time gap. The time gap
can be made smaller if you are living with other sannyasins. If you are
really immersed in the commune, the gap can completely disappear. The
moment you drop the false values imposed upon you, resentment also will
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, when your resentment disappears, then for the first
time you will be able to be loving towards your father, towards your
mother, towards your brothers, sisters, towards your teachers – because
you will have the understanding that whatsoever they did, there was no
bad intention</p><p><br></p><p>behind it. They were simply doing to you what was done to them by
their teachers, by their parents. You will have a deep compassion for
them. You will have a new feeling arising in you, of love – and of
sadness too, because those people have missed.</p><p>The day you can feel sad that your father and your mother have missed
life, do you think you will be still angry against them? You will feel
great love. Just go once in a while and share you love, share your song,
share your dance. They will be surprised, and you will be surprised
also. They will be surprised that this boy who has always been a
troublemaker in the family has become so peaceful, so serene, just a
silent lake full of lotus flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will be surprised that they are not treating you the way they
used to treat you. In fact, you will see that they want to understand
what has happened to you. You look so beautiful, you look a totally new
being – what has happened? They would like to know, and they would
desire, if it is possible, for them also to be in the same space you are
in.</p><p><br></p><p>But if sannyasins go on living for small things – the salary, the
position, the power in the old rotten society – there is every
possibility Those dead corpses are many, too many, and you will be
very</p><p>alone. And when death is stinking all around you, there is every
possibility you will become accustomed to it, just the way others are
accustomed to think this is the only fragrance in the world – the
stinking death, the sick, slave mind, souls chained by the past, hearts
burdened with mountains that are millions of years old. It is very
difficult for you to save yourself where everything is just a g
rave.</p><p>Why live in a graveyard? Even if you are paid as a watchman for the
graveyard, forget about that pay. Of course, you are great there – the
only living being, and everybody is dead. You are almost a king – the
watchman in a graveyard is almost a king. His whole empire nobody can go
against him,</p><p>nobody can move against him. He is whole and sole authority; he can
do anything to anybody. He can change their names, he can change their
gravestones.</p><p>But please, don’t enjoy such stupidities. Life is very valuable and
very short. Move to the communes. Make new communes. If old communes are
too big and cannot take you in, create new communes. These oases around
the earth – which is completely a desert – will become the womb for the
New Man to be born.</p><p>And don’t be worried in the commune by people who start behaving<span class=s6></span>because they always wanted to</p><p>rebel against anything that has been forced upon them. If they start
behaving a little wrongly, don’t be hard on them. Your hardness will not
help them. Be soft, loving. Your love will cleanse them, and a natural
growth of all that makes you the privileged beings in existence will
arise of its own accord.</p><p>We don’t teach any discipline. People ask me, “You don’t teach any
discipline – then how can five thousand people go on living together?”
There is no need to teach discipline. All that is needed is that
everybody should feel loved, respected, dignified – whatever he is
doing.</p><p><br></p><p>In our commune whether you are the vice-chancellor of the university
or just a driver makes no difference. These are functional things. One
is serving the commune as a vice-chancellor, another is serving the
commune as a driver. Both are necessary. Both are exactly dignified
human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried about a few people being disrespectful towards me,
because I have never come across a sannyasin who is disrespectful
towards me. Perhaps I am blind, perhaps I don’t understand the language
of disrespect? No, I am not blind. No, I do understand every kind of
language.</p><p>But when I am respectful to you, how can you manage to be
disrespectful to me? It is just impossible. If I love you so much, how
can you manage not to love me? And I am not expecting it. I love you
because I cannot do anything else, and I am grateful to you that you
don’t refuse my love. That’s enough for me.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is bound to stir your heart – a new dimension opening. Your
father was giving you gifts because you respected him; your mother was
very favorable to you because you loved her. Between me and you there is
nothing other than love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is happening for the first time in the history of man that a
master declares himself as ordinary as you are, that a master wants to
be just one amongst you. There is no desire in me to be holier than you,
higher than you, better than you. How can you manage to disrespect me?
If you can manage, manage. If you can manage to hate me, do it. Perhaps
I deserve it. Perhaps that is the only way for you to get rid of the
hate.</p><p>Even the person who hates me relates with me emotionally, just like
the person who loves me. They both are relating to me: one positively,
one negatively. And this is such a small job, for me to change the
negative into the positive. I can do it any day, so I never feel in a
hurry and jump upon you to change; I wait. I wait for the change to come
on its own, otherwise, something of resentment will remain – a thin
layer maybe, somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So as far as I am concerned, be absolutely sure I have no complaint
against any sannyasin – even against those sannyasins who have left
sannyas. My love to them remains the same, my hope for them remains the
same. I know perfectly well, sooner or later, they will have to come
back, because they cannot exist with the dead, old society. Once they
have tasted the juices of a living, new commune, they cannot mix with
the old society. Where are they going to go? Santa Fe?</p><p>It is so simple, you can understand Those few sannyasins who have
left me have all gathered in</p><p>Santa Fe. Now I have to take care of two communes: your commune and
the commune of the camels in Santa Fe. But those camels are going to
come back home sooner or later. You should not have any resentment for
those who have left. Freedom to me is the highest value; there is
nothing higher than that.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of freedom you have joined my caravan. Out of freedom, some day
you feel to depart.</p><p><br></p><p>I bless you exactly the same on both occasions. When you become a
sannyasin I bless you, and when you drop sannyas I bless you – because
sannyas does not matter. What matters is the respect, the dignity of a
human being, and I cannot in any way hurt your dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD.
NOBODY EVER REACHED THAT MANY PEOPLE BEFORE. IS THERE ANY LIMIT TO THE
NUMBER OF YOUR DISCIPLES?</p><p>First, correct your numbers. I don’t have four hundred thousand
sannyasins. I have almost double that number: eight hundred thousand
sannyasins. And there is no limit – we are going to take the whole
earth! There is no limit. And this takeover is not political.
Politicians should not be worried about it. This takeover is far deeper,
far more significant; it is spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why nobody before me in his lifetime has been able to
reach so many people is simple: he was not open to all. He had a certain
prejudice, a certain ideology, a certain program that he wanted to
impose upon you. He could reach only those people who were ready for
that kind of program.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have any program. I am available to all. Whether you are a
Jew, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian, or a communist does
not make any difference, because I don’t have any program to enforce
upon you. My work is just the opposite: I am deprogramming you.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are a communist, my work is the same – I deprogram the
communist, he is no longer communist. If you are a Jew, I deprogram the
Jew – the process is the same, you are no longer a Jew. If you are a
German, I deprogram you. It is a little hard, but on the other hand,
when the deprogramming succeeds, the German proves to be the most
reliable. He takes a little time, resists, but when he gives way he
gives way totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Whoever comes to me, I don’t give him any discipline that he has to
live by: don’t smoke cigarettes, don’t drink alcohol, don’t look at
somebody else’s wife with desire.</p><p>I don’t know... how can you look at a beautiful woman without desire?
It is insulting to the woman, it is against her human dignity. A woman,
a beautiful woman, should be desired. The more she is desired, the more
people look at her with desire, the more beautiful she becomes, the more
contented she becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see that anything that all old, stupid religions have been
telling you will prevent you from reaching God. In the first place there
is no God to reach, so don’t be worried about it. You are not going
anywhere – to any God, to any paradise.</p><p>Secondly, I have not experienced that anything – alcohol, cigars,
gambling, love affairs – anything that all the religions have been
prohibiting can prevent your becoming enlightened. You can perfectly
become enlightened, there is no need to sit under a bo tree.</p><p><br></p><p>You can become enlightened with a Havana cigar, resting in your chair
by the side of Patanjali lake, naked – there is no problem in it. How
can a Havana cigar prevent enlightenment? I don’t see the arithmetic of
it. It may perhaps help, but it cannot prevent.</p><p><br></p><p>It may help you to relax. It may help you just to be in the moment –
naked, by the side of Patanjali Lake, enjoying the fresh air. A little
champagne, may help you to be more meditative, because it will help you
to get rid of other worries: that you have a wife, a nagging wife, that
you have a husband who is just an idiot. Just a little champagne will
take you away from all these ideas.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I have been able to reach eight hundred thousand people
around the world. And these are the sannyasins. There are millions more
who are just on the borderline; any moment they can become sannyasins.
There are many more who may never become sannyasins, but feel that they
are cowards, feel that this is the right thing to do. Perhaps in their
next life they may become sannyasins.</p><p>We are going to take over the world in a spiritual sense. We are not
interested in taking over governments, nations. We are interested in
destroying nations, governments – there is no need of all this
paraphernalia! What is the need of a president? Yes, if there are
nations, then presidents are needed, premiers are needed, commanders in
chief are needed, an army is needed, nuclear weapons are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see that these things are needed to make humanity happier,
more comfortable, more lovable, more dignified, more free. I don’t see
how these things can help; they have not helped for thousands of years.
It is time that we take over the whole world spiritually, and dissolve
all kinds of nonsense that have been torturing man, stopping his
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>The world can live in so much peace, serenity My effort, in short, is
not to take you to paradise, but</p><p>to bring the paradise to you on this earth. It can be done, because I
have done it for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think paradise can give anything more to me. In fact, I don’t
want to go to paradise – if there is any paradise – because I don’t want
to associate with those dead, ugly saints, ascetics, of all the
religions. They will be there.</p><p><br></p><p>If<span class=s6></span>it is only an “if,” there is no heaven, no
hell, but if there is a hell I would like to go there, because</p><p>there I will find all the juicy people of the world, not dead bones,
dry. I will find there Maupassant, Tolstoy, Byron, Van Gogh, Lautrec,
Rabindranath, Nijinsky – the list is infinite. All the poets, all the
musicians, all the dancers, all the lovers, all those who are creative
will be in hell because they were not religious people. They were not
ascetics, they enjoyed life to the fullest.</p><p>Now, you cannot think of Byron in heaven. England had to expel him –
do you think paradise will accept him? England had to expel him because
he was a woman’s man. All the so-called ladies completely forgot that
they were ladies. Byron was so beautiful, so charming, that any woman
would have fallen in love with him, and hundreds of women did fall in
love with him.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that husbands became so much afraid – and you can imagine
British husbands! – that if Byron entered a restaurant, husbands would
take the hands of their wives and rush out from the other door. Finally
they could not stand him anymore, he was creating so much nuisance. And
he was doing nothing, he was just a loving being, non-possessive. They
expelled him. The day he was expelled, even the ladies from the royalty
were there to give him a send-off – thousands of women. Now, this man
cannot enter heaven, that much is certain. And I would like to meet
Byron; I see a potential sannyasin in him.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, I will be doing the same work in hell. If I can do this
work on this earth, which is far worse than any hell, why can’t I do
this work in hell? It will be easier there, because there is a better
quality of people – intelligent people, creative people. They are just
waiting for me to come. The moment you allow me to go, I will be with
them. That is the company I would like to be associated with.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>26</span></p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is you completely gone</p><p><br></p><p>24 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO</p><p><br></p><p>SEEING THAT EVERYONE WANTS SO MUCH TO BE ENLIGHTENED, ISN’T
ITALSOTRUE THAT WE ARE ALL SCARED TOO? WHAT IS THE FEAR THAT PREVENTS US
FROM RELAXING INTO OUR OWN SELF?</p><p><br></p><p>There are many fears, not one.</p><p><br></p><p>First, if you want to be enlightened, you have to die a psychological
death. You have to be reborn as a new spiritual being, and you don’t
know anything about spirituality. All that you know about yourself is
your mind, centered around the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange phenomenon, that you are identified with
something which you are not, and you have forgotten that which you are,
have always been, will always be. There is no way to be anything else.
Your being belongs to the existential. But there are layers and layers
of conditioning – of parents, of teachers, of priests, of politicians.
Between you, the real you, and you, the unreal you, there is a great
line of people.</p><p>And naturally, you loved your parents, they loved you. Whatsoever
they have done to you is absolutely unconscious, it was not intentional.
They never wanted you to be a hypocrite, but they have made you a
hypocrite. I never suspect their intentions. Their intentions were to
make you something great, but they are as unconscious as you are. Their
parents have given them</p><p><br></p><p>their unconsciousness as an inheritance; and this has been going on
since Adam and Eve. Every generation goes on loading the coming
generation with all kinds of rubbish, stupidity, superstitions.</p><p>But don’t be angry with them. You have heard about “the angry young
man.” The angry young man is an idiot. Anger is not going to solve
anything; it is going to make everything more difficult and more
complicated. Your parents, your teachers, your neighbors don’t deserve
anger; they deserve compassion. They could not do anything else. With
all good wishes they have destroyed you, just the way their parents had
destroyed them.</p><p>And if you don’t become enlightened you are going to destroy your
children. For their own sake, you are going to give them all kinds of
crap.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been told you are a Christian, you are a Hindu, you are a
Mohammedan. You came into the world as a tabula rasa; nothing was
written on you. Your parents engraved on you and made you a Christian
and forced the idea of Christianity on you, and they used your fear,
your greed to implement it. You were made afraid of hell, you were made
greedy for heaven. And of course, they wanted you not to fall into the
ways of sin, but to follow the royal road of virtue.</p><p>Nothing was wrong in their intentions; their intentions are not in
question. What is in question is that they were not conscious, that the
seeds they were sowing in you were seeds of poison. No well- wishing, no
good intentions are going to change those seeds. And once they have got
roots in you it becomes more and more difficult to get rid of them,
because you are identified with the tree of poisons.</p><p>It is difficult for a Christian to put Christianity aside. He will
feel he is doing something like a betrayal. Putting aside Christianity
he will feel he is betraying Jesus Christ. He is not betraying anyone.
He is simply trying to get out of the mess of conditioning that all
kinds of people have put upon him.</p><p><br></p><p>My grandmother – my mother’s mother – was a tremendously beautiful
woman. She loved me so much that I was more in touch with her than with
my own mother. I used to come to my mother’s house to eat twice a day,
and then I went to the school. But every night I was in my grandmother’s
house. She lived in the same town; when her husband died, she moved
there. She was alone, there was no other child – my mother was her only
child.</p><p>But she was of an independent character. Everybody tried to persuade
her to live with my father’s family, but she said, “That is not
possible. Not that I don’t love you and don’t want to live with you, but
I want to be utterly independent, on my own.”</p><p><br></p><p>So she lived just a few houses away, so that my father and my mother
could take care in any emergency – she was old. But I was sleeping every
night at her house. She had all blessings for me.</p><p><br></p><p>One day when I was carrying her spiritual book of Jainism, it fell.
She immediately fell on the earth and put her head at the imaginary feet
of the religious book. I asked her, “What are you doing? A book is a
book – religious or unreligious, it doesn’t matter. It is printed on the
same kind of paper, with the same kind of ink, with the same kind of
words.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was old, but very understanding. She said, “Perhaps you are
right, but my whole life is involved. The religious book falling on the
ground is not a good sign; we have to ask its forgiveness. It has to be
on our heads, not at our feet.”</p><p>I used to argue with her. I said, “The book is dead. Whether you put
it on your head or you stand on it, it</p><p>will not know the difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was shocked, and at the same time she said, “What you are saying,
I can see the point of it, but now it is too late. I am so old – now to
start living from scratch, now to start thinking again from the very
beginning is a great task. And it is not only a question of this book;
so much is involved in it – my attitude towards the religion, my
attitude towards the priests, the monks, my attitude towards my
parents.</p><p>“I got this mind as an inheritance, and it is all that I have. You
can destroy it, but then I will feel empty. And when death is coming
closer and I can hear the footsteps of death louder and louder, my son,
it is too late. I don’t want to die empty.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the fear. You are afraid of dropping any conditioning because
that conditioning is giving you a certain personality. But you are not
aware of that, so you are not worried about it. Your personality has
taken the place of your individuality. And to throw away your
personality – which means all your past, the whole of it; there is no
question of choice.…</p><p>It is not a question that there are bad parts in it, throw them; and
there are good parts in it, preserve them. Your whole past is imposed by
others on you, so whether it is good or bad does not matter. The
significant thing to remember is that it is not your discovery, it is
all borrowed; it is secondhand, thirdhand – perhaps through millions of
hands it has passed. It is really dirty. You have to get rid of it in
its totality.</p><p>There will be a gap when you will feel completely lost. You used to
know yourself, who you were. There will come a gap when you will not
know who you are, but that is a beautiful experience, because your
innocence is back again. You are born again; it is a rebirth. Now you
can start discovering.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole territory is new, you have never been here before. You were
kept going round and round on the circumference of your existence. It is
adventurous, it is a great challenge. Fear arises. Fear arises because
what you think you are is certainly in your hands. And the individuality
I am talking about, you don’t have in your hands. You don’t know what
you are going to discover, or whether there is anything to discover or
not.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a proverb in many languages... similar proverbs: “Half a
loaf of bread in the hand is better than the full loaf far away.” And I
am asking you to drop the half loaf for something that is so far away
from you right now. Fear is natural. It is nothing to be worried about,
it just has to be understood.</p><p>One fundamental law of life: you were as alive – perhaps more alive –
in your mother’s womb, but you were not a Christian. You had not yet
heard of Jesus Christ, you were not carrying a Bible, you were not
clinging to a cross. You had no idea what your name is, you had no
ambition to become the president of America, to be the richest man in
the world. You had no ambitions. Ambitions are extensions of your ego:
the bigger the ambition, the bigger ego you are searching for.</p><p><br></p><p>At birth you were simply there. So one thing is certain, that
whatever you have gained after your birth is not really a gain, it is a
loss. On each step you have been losing the real and getting cluttered
with the unreal, losing the precious and getting attached to some
junk.</p><p>It is a question of understanding that even if you drop your whole
past you are not going to die, because you were alive for nine months in
your mother’s womb perfectly well. In fact, scientists say that during
the nine months in the mother’s womb the child grows more, faster, than
he will grow in his whole life of seventy years. He passes through so
many phases; he passes through almost all the phases humanity has passed
through. At a certain moment he looks like a monkey in the mother’s
womb. Earlier than that, he looks like a fish.</p><p><br></p><p>It is now almost an agreed idea that man was born in the ocean as a
fish, millions of years ago. All those millions of years, the child
passes through in days. From the fish to the monkey is a long way; from
the monkey to man is also not a short way.</p><p><br></p><p>In nine months he moves exactly, step by step, as the whole humanity
has moved. He repeats the whole history. So it is absolutely clear that
the way he grows in the mother’s womb... the speed is phenomenal. He
will not grow that fast in a lifetime of seventy years. In fact, in
those seventy years he will simply grow old. He will become less and
less alive. In those seventy years he is moving towards his grave. He is
not growing up, he is going down – down the drain. So there is no need
to be afraid of being reborn.</p><p><br></p><p>I can assure you only of one thing: there is no question of belief.
You can see the point yourself, that without being a Christian, without
being a Jew, without being a Hindu, without being a communist, you were
perfectly alive and kicking.</p><p>In that innocence you have known the most wonderful experience
ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigmund Freud has many beautiful insights. One of his insights is
that everybody on the earth has some idea of a paradise. There is no
culture, no civilization in the past, in the present, which has not had
some kind of idea about a paradise. From where does this idea come?</p><p><br></p><p>Sigmund Freud’s insight is that this idea comes from the womb of the
mother. Those nine months were of tremendous comfort, of absolute
luxury. You had no responsibility, no burden on your head; you had no
duty. You were not doing anything at all except living – and living
alone! You were so full of life that there was no need for someone else
to fulfill you.</p><p><br></p><p>Those nine months in the mother’s womb you have forgotten
consciously, but your unconscious remembers them. In deep hypnosis you
can be made to remember that experience. That unconscious experience of
the most beautiful life for nine months is the reason that people are
searching for a paradise – the paradise they have lost.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the basic root of the story of Adam and Eve being thrown out
of the garden of God. That story is not a historical truth, but it has a
psychological insight. And around the world, in every religion, there is
something similar to it: that there was a day when you lost contact with
all that is beautiful, glorious. The story is simply symbolic. The child
leaving the womb of the mother is really being thrown out of the Garden
of Eden.</p><p><br></p><p>Now begins a tedious journey – from the very beginning, painful. As
he opens his eyes His eyes</p><p>are very delicate: for nine months he has lived in darkness. There
was no need for him to open his eyes, or even if he had opened them
there was nothing to see. Now he opens his eyes – glaring lights; he
starts being hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>In the mother’s womb he was not breathing for himself, it was the
mother who was breathing for him.</p><p>Even that much responsibility was not placed on him, that he has to
breath for himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Thrown out of that beautiful space, he gets his first experience of
the world. The doctor hangs him upside down, and hits him on his
buttocks. A strange reception! And the child has no idea what is going
to happen now. He is so small, everybody is so big. And this nazi
behavior of the doctors.… Something better can be found. It is barbarous
– of course it is done with all good intentions.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor does it for two reasons. One, he hangs him upside down so
any mucus that is inside his breathing passage comes out. Because he has
not been breathing in his mother’s womb, there is mucus filling the tube
that he has to use now. But in a scientific age we can find a better way
to take the mucus out; it should not be done the way it is done. We have
vacuum cleaners. Can’t we manage some vacuum cleaner for the poor child
that takes out the mucus?</p><p>And secondly, as the child is born, the cord that joins him with his
mother’s womb is immediately cut. It is a shock, the greatest shock of
your life, to be cut from your life source. You will have many shocks in
the future, life will give you many troubles; but the child – who has
known no shock, no trouble – is really hurt. It is almost murderous to
cut the cord that joins him with the mother.</p><p><br></p><p>But the doctor does it with all good intentions – because if the cord
is not cut the child may not learn how to breathe. But that is not a
fact; the doctors have been in an unnecessary hurry. If the child is
left on the mother’s belly – he was inside the belly for nine months –
if he is left again on the mother’s belly just two minutes are needed.
But to the doctor even two minutes seem to be too long. And he</p><p>has to deliver many other children; it is simply his profession.</p><p><br></p><p>Just after two minutes, resting on his mother’s belly, the child
starts breathing on his own. A little patience but who is patient? And
after the child has started breathing on his own, then you can</p><p>cut the cord and it will not be a shock. He has become an individual
on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>The child should be given birth to in a very dim light – soft,
soothing. And as soon as the child is able to breath on his own, the
first thing should be to put him in a hot water tub because he has been,
in his mother’s womb, floating in warm water that is constituted of
exactly the same chemicals as sea water.</p><p><br></p><p>So man has come millions of years away from his first ancestors who
were born in the ocean, but basically nothing has changed. Every child
is born in the ocean even now. And women who have known pregnancy will
be aware that when they are pregnant, suddenly they start hankering to
eat salty things, because the child needs water as salty as the
ocean.</p><p>So just a small, warm, salt-water bath, and the child will not feel
shocked, will not feel expelled. The story of Adam and Eve will become
absurd. The child will feel welcomed, entering a vast world of
exploration. He will feel freedom from a confined space. And that kind
of child will not be desirous</p><p><br></p><p>of any paradise; his life will be a paradise. He will not hanker for
and desire something after death because he lost something at birth
which can be attained again only after death.</p><p>Why do your religions say that paradise is after death? It is simple
– because your paradise was before birth. It is appealing, logical.</p><p>I want you to remember that you have existed for nine months with
great energy, growing tremendously – with such speed that in nine months
you passed through millions of years. And you had no political ideology,
you had no religious theology. You had not even a name. Nameless,
religionless, without politics you have existed. So there is no need to
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>I can only make it clear to you that there is no need to fear. You
can drop all that has been added to you after birth, still you will be
living – not only living, but living abundantly. You need not wait for
death. You can give death to your personality now, and be reborn.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly what enlightenment is: the personality dies and the
individuality which was repressed</p><p>by the personality starts growing, flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>But your question raises one more question. Listening to me, or
reading about the idea of enlightenment, you start being greedy for it.
That’s where you miss from the very beginning. You say, “I want to be
enlightened.” Wanting is a barrier. Who is this “I” that wants to be
enlightened?</p><p><br></p><p>This “I” is your very ego, which is preventing you from being
enlightened. Now this “I” which was trying to become a great leader of
men, the richest person in the world, the most powerful president – of
America or the Soviet Union – the same “I” gets a new idea to become
even bigger than all these presidents and all these rich people –
enlightenment. The ego says, “Great! I want to be enlightened.” The ego
cannot be enlightened, just as darkness can not become light.</p><p>Listening to me, or getting the idea from somewhere else, remember:
you cannot want to be enlightened. You can be enlightened, but you
cannot want it, you cannot desire it. It is not some commodity that you
can purchase. It is not some country that you can invade. It is not
there – outside – that you can approach and find it. Enlightenment is
the name of an inner experience in which both are involved: death of the
personality and rebirth of the individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the monasteries around the world are desiring to be
enlightened, to be awakened, to be liberated – so many words for the
same experience. But they are just being stupid. They are, in fact, by
desiring enlightenment, making enlightenment a commodity in the
market.</p><p>Enlightenment is not something to be desired.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what has one to do? One has to understand one’s personality,
layer by layer. Forget all about enlightenment, it has nothing to do
with you. One thing is certain: you cannot be enlightened. Begin with
what you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as one peels an onion, peel your personality, layer by layer. Go
on throwing those layers. New layers will be there, but finally a moment
comes when the onion disappears and there is only emptiness in your
hands. That moment is the moment of enlightenment. You cannot desire
it,</p><p><br></p><p>because desire adds another layer to your onion – and a far more
dangerous layer than any other layer.</p><p>Becoming a president is not such a big thing, any idiot can do it. In
fact, idiots are doing it all around the world. Who else is interested
in becoming a president or a prime minister? I have never seen any man
of wisdom trying to become the president, the premier.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you observed a strange fact, that in the past there have been a
few kings who became enlightened? Ashoka in India became enlightened. He
was one of the greatest emperors in the world – in fact, India has never
been that big since him. Parts of India went on being invaded, becoming
new countries. Today India is only one-third of what it was in Ashoka’s
empire.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been other emperors in China, in Japan, in Greece who have
become enlightened. An emperor is not one who has desired to become an
emperor. Just as somebody is born a beggar, he is born an emperor. He
takes it for granted; it does not become a layer of greed around his
onion.</p><p>But we have never heard of any president, any prime minister becoming
enlightened. It sounds strange, but the reason is clear. Presidents are
not born, they have to struggle for it, they have to lie and promise –
knowing perfectly well that these promises cannot be fulfilled. They
have to be diplomatic, they can’t say what they want. They go on saying
things, and they are never going to do them. The politician has to be
very cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>No politician has been known to become enlightened, for the simple
reason that in a democratic world, where monarchy has disappeared, to be
the head of the state is one of the greatest desires of the ego. But the
desire for enlightenment is the ultimate desire; you cannot desire
anything bigger than that. You have asked for the ultimate bliss, you
have asked for the ultimate existential wisdom.</p><p>Don’t make enlightenment a desire; otherwise you will go on missing.
What I suggest to you is, forget about enlightenment. It has nothing to
do with you, you will never see it; it happens when you are not. When
you have peeled the onion completely, when your ego evaporates, it is
there. But you cannot say, “I have become enlightened.” The “I” is no
more there – enlightenment is there.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear is natural, because you have to drop your whole personality,
and that’s all you have got right now. You don’t know there is something
behind it. You want to gain more, and I am saying to you to lose
everything that makes you. That’s the fear. If you listen to the fear,
then there is no hope.</p><p>But in fact, what have you got? Anxiety, anguish, boredom, despair,
failure – thousands of complexes. This is your whole treasure. Just look
at it! What is the fear in dropping this treasury, in getting rid of
your anxiety, throwing away your boredom?</p><p><br></p><p>But things are really complicated. Why are you bored? And why can’t
you get rid of it? There must be some vested interest in it. You are
bored with your wife or your husband. Every wife and every husband are
bound to come to a point when they are fed up with each other, bored.
But there is a complication. You cannot just say goodbye to your wife.
You have got children, you both love them, you don’t want to leave those
children. There is going to be a fight in a court over who is to have
the children; both can’t have them.</p><p><br></p><p>You have a certain prestige in the society. People think you are one
of the model couples because they see you always showing love to each
other. When you leave for the office you kiss your wife, when you come
from the office you kiss your wife – as a ritual. Neither you mean
anything nor she means anything, and you both know it. And while you are
kissing your wife you are saying within yourself, “To hell with all
this!”</p><p>But the people don’t hear what you are saying within yourself. They
just see. “Thirty years of marriage, and still they are so loving, as if
on their car the board is still hanging: Just married. Their honeymoon
seems to be becoming longer and longer – thirty years of honeymoon!”
There is no end to it. When you go in the society you pretend; you have
to keep people’s idea of you as the best couple. These are your
investments.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps you are rich because you married a rich woman. If you drop
her you will be a beggar again; you don’t want to do that. Perhaps you
got a good employment because of your wife’s good looks – it is a very
strange world – or your wife’s relations, influence. You may lose the
job if you drop your wife.</p><p><br></p><p>So how to drop the boredom? – the boredom is connected with so many
investments. It needs courage, great courage. And I would like to say to
you that it is better to be a beggar but without boredom, far better
than to be an emperor and bored, because boredom is spiritual begging.
And it never comes alone. If you are bored there will be despair, there
will be anxiety, a continuous tension in the mind: What to do? You have
to go on living with a woman or a man you would like to kill – and you
have to kiss them.</p><p><br></p><p>To drop boredom means to take a revolutionary step, whatever the
cost; you are not going to drag through your life as a bored man,
because what is the point of living? And you will see all around the
world, everybody is bored. Somebody is bored with his work, his job. He
never wanted to be a doctor, but his parents forced him to be a doctor
because it is respectable, profit-making. You make the profit, you get
the respect, and still you are called a great public servant, because
you are serving humanity. It is really great!</p><p>Your parents forced you to become a doctor. You hate it, you never
wanted it; you wanted to become a painter. But nobody listened to you,
they said, “You are crazy. If you want to be a painter you will die as a
beggar on the street. Forget all about this nonsense. When one is young
all kinds of romantic ideas come into the mind. Cool down, boy. We also
have seen younger days, and we have also dreamed of great things, but
now we know that all those romantic ideas are just a passing phase. If
we allow you to become a painter, you will never forgive us! We cannot
allow you to be a painter.”</p><p><br></p><p>You want to be a musician, a dancer, a sculptor, but nobody is going
to support you. You wanted to be a dancer and you have become a
businessman; you are bored with it. You really want one day to hang
yourself from a tree and be finished with it all. But that too you
cannot do because there is so much to do – you have to fill in your tax
return forms, and the tax department is after you You don’t</p><p>have time to hang yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>So many things are unfinished around you. First you have to finish
everything, then go and hang yourself. But things will always remain
unfinished. And the idea of hanging yourself gives a little</p><p><br></p><p>relaxation, gives a certain pleasure that whatsoever the situation,
there is always one exit: you can always hang yourself. So what is the
hurry? And who knows? Tomorrow things may change, you may find the right
woman.</p><p>There is no right woman, no right man, nobody has ever found one. But
the fantasy of finding the right man, the right woman.… Every couple,
when they fall in love for the first time, think they are made for each
other: this is the woman he has dreamed of always. This is what the man,
the woman, has been always thinking of, desiring. But by the time the
honeymoon is over you know that you are caught with a wrong person; you
are not made for each other.</p><p><br></p><p>But you go on fantasizing, “Perhaps some other woman?” – because the
world is so full of women, so full of men. This time you missed, next
time.…</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends got married three times. It is difficult in India
to get a divorce. Almost his whole life was wasted; women were the
trouble. The law is not easy, but somehow he managed, because in India
you can somehow manage everything. All that is needed is money, and he
had money. You can bribe everybody. It is a national tradition and not
new, very ancient.</p><p><br></p><p>Indians have been bribing God, so what do they care about bribing a
clerk or a judge? When the Indian goes to the temple and says to his
god, “If I win this lottery, I will present you with sweets worth five
rupees” or “I will give a feast to eleven brahmins,” what is this? And
the lottery is one million rupees; with five rupees he is trying to get
one million rupees! And for centuries Indians have been bribing God; it
is their heritage. Nobody feels bad about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can give a bribe to anybody – neither you feel bad about it nor
he feels bad about it, because he is doing you work. It is almost
payment for the work. And he is doing work which is far costlier than
the bribe you are giving him. You manage everything. You can murder, and
you will be released respectfully by the court; all that you need is
money.</p><p><br></p><p>So one goes on thinking that tomorrow may be different. My friend
changed wives three times, and he was always telling me, “This time I am
not going to fall for a woman like the one I am getting rid of. She is a
real bitch!”</p><p>And I told him, “You will always fall in love with a real bitch.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is strange. You go on insisting, and the wonder is
that you are always right! The next woman proved as bitchy as the first,
the third woman proved as bitchy as the others. How do you predict?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t predict, I am not an astrologer. I simply know you;
what kind of woman will be appealing to you, that I know. Why had you
fallen for the first woman? Have you thought, analyzed, what qualities
of that woman have attracted you? And who is going to find the second
woman for you? You will, again, and you will again be attracted to the
same things.</p><p>“You have not changed, your attractions have not changed. You have
never bothered that you are responsible for having chosen that woman.
That’s why three times you have got the same kind of commodity... again
and again and again. It is not a question of divorce, it is not a
question of changing women; it is a question of changing your mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>But people always try to dump things on others. You are in anxiety
because your children are becoming hippies. Your girl is taking dope,
your boy is doing everything that is wrong – long hair, beard, drugs,
and he has dropped out of the university. You are in anxiety: What is
going to happen? You are dumping your anxiety on the girl, on the boy,
on the wife – anybody will do.</p><p>Do you think if your boy was going perfectly straight, your girl was
not getting pregnant before marriage, if they were not on drugs do you
think you would have been without anxiety? I know many people whose
daughters are following whatsoever they say, whose sons are doing their
education the way the parents want – still they have anxiety over
something else. They will find some other object to become worried
about.</p><p>If you have children you are worried about your children. If you
don’t have children you are worried why God has not given you children.
It seems to be really a zoo of all kinds of animals, this world of
ours.</p><p><br></p><p>Dropping the layers of your ego means that you are ready to commit a
psychological suicide. I call it sannyas just to give it a good name,
because if I call it suicide you will be more frightened. You have come
here to be enlightened, not to commit suicide. But the reality is that
unless you commit suicide there is no enlightenment. People want
enlightenment, and they don’t want to drop anything, to lose
anything.</p><p>The day I said, “Before I leave the world I would like to give my
sannyasins rainbow-colored robes, there should be no need by that time
for my sannyasins to wear red clothes” – immediately, the next day,
people started reaching the commune’s office, saying, “We want sannyas,
but we are not going to use red clothes, nor are we going to use the
mala. Give us sannyas. Osho has said already that the red clothes or the
mala are not sannyas.”</p><p><br></p><p>My secretary came to me and asked, “What to do? You go on creating
trouble for us. In the first place, from where are we to get rainbow
dresses? And people are understanding according to their mind. They are
understanding that all the colors of the rainbow can be used – somebody
in red, somebody in blue, somebody in green – the commune will be using
all the colors. They have not understood what you were saying.” I was
absolutely clear, but you managed to understand what you wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>I received a few letters: “We are thinking of taking sannyas, but
your idea of a rainbow-colored dress made us frightened, because in the
past only buffoons, jokers in the circus, have used rainbow dresses. We
don’t want to become laughingstocks. Red is perfectly good.”</p><p>I told my secretary, “Tell these people, ‘Then why are you waiting,
if red is perfectly good?’” It became good in comparison to the rainbow
robe. It is not good in comparison to ordinary clothes that people wear,
because in red clothes you will immediately attract attention,
discrimination. People will not feel at ease with you. They will be
hostile to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked my sannyasins to be in red clothes, with the mala, with
the locket of my picture, just to see whether you can gather a little
courage or not. If even this much courage is not possible then you
cannot commit suicide, you cannot drop your ego.</p><p><br></p><p>You want enlightenment as you are. Now, that is impossible. You will
have to chop out many things which have become almost identical with
yourself. And that’s what I am doing continuously – hitting, hammering,
shocking you. And I will go on doing everything possible that can shock
you, hurt you, wound you because I want you to become aware that it is
your ego that gets wounded, it is your ego that gets hurt.</p><p>Just the other day I was saying I am going to start smoking Havana
cigars while delivering the religious, spiritual discourse. Now many
camels will start moving towards Santa Fe. “What kind of a master smokes
Havana cigars?” Do you think you are going away because of my Havana
cigars? No. It hurts your ego. You wanted a master nobody can say
anything against. You wanted to be a disciple of a great master who has
extraordinary powers, who changes water into wine.</p><p><br></p><p>I also do miracles – I change wine into water. So if you see me
drinking champagne, don’t be worried. The moment I touch it, it is
water. But champagne by my side, and the camels will get troubled, will
start looking at the map – where is Santa Fe? All the camels are going
towards Santa Fe.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not my champagne, it is not my Havana cigars, it is not
anything to do with me – it is your ego. This is a great conspiracy that
has been going on between the disciples and the so-called masters all
through history. The disciple feels his ego fulfilled because he has
found the right master, who does not smoke Havana cigars, does not drink
champagne. Both are controlling each other.</p><p>The master cannot do anything against the expectations of the
disciples, because then he will lose disciples, and with fewer disciples
you are a smaller master. It is a question of numbers; with more
disciples you are a bigger master. A great number of disciples, and you
are the greatest master in the world.</p><p>So he cannot lose camels; even if the camels never change, he is not
going to do anything that will make the numbers become less. It is a
politics of numbers. And, of course, because he fasts, he can force his
disciples to fast.</p><p>I cannot. I do not fast. In fact, I cannot go to sleep in the night
unless I have eaten Indian sweets – against my doctors’ advice. I have
told them, “It is your business to figure it out. Diabetes I give to
you, you figure it out.” But I cannot go to sleep.… My grandmother used
to keep the sweets that I liked by my bedside, because in the middle of
the night I might wake up. Then to go to sleep again needs sweets;
otherwise I cannot.</p><p><br></p><p>You want a master who fulfills your ego, but you don’t know – the man
who fulfills your ego, who is in tune with your expectations, is your
enemy; he is not your master. The sooner you get rid of such a man, the
better. But no, if a master goes on a fast for twenty-one days every
year he will gather many people around him who will say, “This is the
man. It is worth being a disciple of this man.” And what has he done? He
has just been hungry, starving, for twenty-one days.</p><p>Why don’t you go to Ethiopia? You will find great masters who are
fasting unto death – not twentyone days, because nobody dies after
twenty-one days of fasting. It takes ninety days for a man to die by
fasting.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are not aware of the conspiracy. The man who fasts for
twenty-one days becomes authoritative, more powerful than you. He
demands that you at least fast for three days, and you cannot say to him
that he is asking too much. He is fasting for twenty-one days, and he
asks you only to fast for three days. He is perfectly authorized to ask
it. He is celibate, he asks you to be celibate. He eats only one time a
day, he demands you also eat one time a day.</p><p>Do you see the mutual conspiracy? You feel you are the disciple of a
great master– of course you are a great disciple as a consequence: a
simple arithmetic. Great masters have only great disciples, but those
masters are fulfilling their egos, and they are fulfilling your egos. No
transformation is possible in such a conspiracy.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t give you any discipline. I don’t command you to do certain
things and not to do certain things, for the simple reason... who am I?
I have no authority over you.</p><p><br></p><p>I look at you as my friends. If you think about me as your master,
that is your generosity. But it is not required by me. This way I remain
free from your expectations, and I keep you free from my expectations.
In this way I am not trying to fulfill my ego, and I am trying in every
possible way to destroy your ego the way I destroyed mine.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a difficult task. Fear is bound to be there, but to act
according to your fear is to degrade yourself even from camelhood. You
become a monkey, or a donkey, or finally a Yankee. Perhaps you are there
already, at the stage called Yankee.</p><p><br></p><p>I will accept you at any stage. I will not demand that you become
something else, something more, something bigger, something holier,
something spiritual. No, all those are games of the same ego we want to
get rid of.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t follow your fear instinct, because that is going to make you a
coward. It degrades your humanity. It is a humiliation imposed by
yourself. Whenever you see some fear, go against it! A simple criterion:
whenever you see there is fear, go against it and you will be always
moving, growing, expanding, coming closer to the moment when ego simply
drops – because its whole functioning is through fear. And the absence
of the ego is enlightenment; it is not something plus.</p><p>Enlightenment is not something plus added to you. Enlightenment is
you completely one.</p><p><br></p><p>It is minus phenomenon; you are no longer there. It does not happen
to you, it happens when you are</p><p>no longer hindering it, when you are not. That’s why I call
enlightenment a psychological suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>27</span></p><p><br></p><p>Chase the woman gently</p><p><br></p><p>25 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE WOMEN HERE ARE BECOMING JUICIER AND MORE
ACTIVE, WHILE WE MEN ARE BECOMING LAZIER AND LAZIER. WOULD YOU
COMMENT?</p><p>The women is not the weaker sex, as it has been said by man for
centuries. The woman is the stronger sex. She is made weaker. For
centuries upon centuries she has been conditioned; she has been told she
needs a protector.</p><p>The Indian scripture of Manu, which has dominated the Hindu mind for
five thousand years and still dominates it, says that when the woman is
a child she should be dependent on the parents, protected by the
parents. When she is young, she should be dependent on the husband and
protected by the husband. When she is old, she should still remain
dependent – on the boys, her children, and be protected by her own
children. For her whole life she has to be protected by somebody. If for
thousands of years you protect somebody in this way, you are bound to
create weakness, dependence, fear.</p><p>And it has been almost accepted as a scientific fact that man is the
stronger sex. It is absolutely wrong! The woman is the stronger sex, and
she has to be, because she has to produce children. She has to be
pregnant and go through all the troubles of pregnancy.</p><p>Not a single man could stand one pregnancy. Just think of yourself
being pregnant for nine months: You cannot eat, you vomit; you go on
carrying a weight which is growing bigger and bigger within</p><p><br></p><p>your belly. And then the final stage, the baby comes out of you. The
passage is so small, the baby is big; it is painful. The woman passes
almost through death when the child is born. And you think she is weaker
than man?</p><p>Women live longer than men all over the world; the difference is of
five years. If man lives on average seventy years, the woman lives on
average seventy-five years. Strange, the weaker sex lives longer.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is more prone to sicknesses, diseases, infections, than woman.
And the difference is not small, it is double. Women are prone to
sickness in comparison to man just half as much; if they get sick, it is
only fifty percent as often. If man has to be considered, he gets sick
and is available to any infection twice as often as women, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the cause of it? The woman has more resistance power. The man
is very weak against small bugs – and yet he becomes Muhammad Ali the
great! He cannot fight small bugs, he is incapable of doing any boxing
against them. But the woman does.</p><p>It is a very strange thing that the suicide rate of the man is double
that of the woman – and woman is the weaker sex? She suffers more, her
whole life in the past has been of suffering. Women have been treated
like cattle.</p><p><br></p><p>In China for thousands of years the woman has not been believed to
have a soul. So if the husband murders his wife, he commits no crime.
The woman was a possession. Without a soul, so much resistance against
diseases? And man has a soul, but the resistance is only half that which
a woman has.</p><p><br></p><p>The man becomes frantic very soon, carries thousands of worries in
his head, is almost on the verge of falling into anxiety, anguish,
suicide. It starts even in the mother’s womb.</p><p>An experienced woman who has given birth to one or two children can
tell whether the child in her womb is male or female. How can she guess
it? Very simple guesswork, which is absolutely certain. The boy starts
kicking in her womb; the girl is calm and quiet. And the mother can feel
that difference. The boy is becoming tense, worried already, already
trying to learn boxing. The girl is very silent in the mother’s womb –
creates no movement, is more stable, more centered, more grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Women threaten that they will commit suicide, but they do not do it.
The difference is again the same: men commit suicide twice as often as
women do. And it has to be understood that their suicides are also
different. The woman commits suicide because the man forces her to
commit suicide. Man commits suicide because of his own anguish, worry,
despair.</p><p><br></p><p>If the woman were not forced by man to commit suicide, no woman would
commit suicide. In fact, the woman’s suicide is really a murder – murder
by the man: man’s society, man’s rule, man’s power. And the woman has
survived all along without any complaint. That is strength. Man forcing
the woman to commit suicide should be punished – it is a murder. But
behind the word suicide he is completely free of any crime.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is that women are becoming juicier here every day. They
would become juicier all around the earth every day; they just have to
be given the opportunity. It is their intrinsic nature to</p><p><br></p><p>be juicier. The woman has to nourish the child – she needs the juice.
The woman attracts the male –</p><p>she has to be juicier. She is certainly more beautiful, more
proportionate; her body is an artwork.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not believe in the bogus Christian story that God created man
first. The story must have been created by a man, because what use is
man? And then he created the woman, taking a rib out of the man. This is
simply to insult women: “You are nothing but a rib taken out of man. You
are not human beings”.</p><p><br></p><p>If I have to write the story, I will say God first created Eve, not
Adam – because the woman is creative, she is going to give birth. In
fact, there was no need for Adam to be created by God. The story is,
that God made love to the first woman he made. If that is true, then
Adam is simply superfluous. The woman, and God making love to the
woman... Adams will follow of their own accord. Adam need not be
created, he will be born. But you need the woman first. Without her
there is no possibility of anything getting born.</p><p><br></p><p>But for thousands of years, if you go on hammering the idea that
woman is a weaker sex The</p><p>woman has shrunk, she has accepted the idea. She has lived according
to the male chauvinist’s</p><p>philosophy.</p><p>Here in this commune it is totally different. The woman finds herself
absolutely free from all the jargon that man has been teaching her. And
we have given all the opportunities to women that no society anywhere
has been able to give them. All societies have taken away opportunities
– and things need opportunities to grow, to reach to their
potential.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman has somehow survived because she is so strong. But she has
only survived – no nourishment. Here she is nourished, here she knows
she is accepted on an equal basis. In fact, the women in the commune
have more responsible posts than men. This is just a compensation –
small, but it may become the model for the whole universe. And they are
running the commune better than any society run by men.</p><p>In four years of the commune’s existence there has not been a single
crime, not a single murder, not a single suicide. Man has not been able
to create a society where crimes are not growing. And as the woman
becomes juicier, more powerful, stronger, takes her natural position,
the man is bound to become lazier. That is his nature – he is bone
lazy.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in a few aboriginal communities in India. They are very
primitive people; they live in the mountains, in the jungles. Somehow
they are free form the stupidity the whole humanity lives under. Their
small, primitive communities are matriarchal, not patriarchal. The woman
rules, the woman is powerful. But I saw men almost shrunken, lazy, doing
nothing. I was surprised. What happened to the strong sex?</p><p>The strong sex – the so-called strong sex – seeing that the woman is
doing perfectly well, better that he can do, has done only one thing: he
has married four, five women, and he sits in the house in the rocking
chair, smoking, looking after the children. The woman works for
everything – for food, for clothing, for all the necessities of life.
Man’s work has become confined just to looking after the children –
which is not much of a job.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman takes all the responsibility of the outside world – farming
the land, growing the gardens, weaving the clothes. And she also is
responsible for the household: making food, making the house comfortable
– and the man simply goes on becoming lazier and stupider. I would not
like it to happen here. It is ugly.</p><p>Man should take the challenge. If women are becoming juicier, now is
the time to prove And as far</p><p>as laziness is concerned, I alone am enough. I am ready to take all
your laziness upon myself. But remember that you have been for centuries
lying, befooling. This is a great opportunity to prove that you are
stronger – but every man deep down knows he is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man feels a deep inferiority complex, for the simple reason
that he cannot produce children, he cannot give birth to life. His
function in giving birth to children is only that of an injection. Any
injection can do that. In fact, in the future, injections will be doing
that; then man will be completely out of a job.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be lazy... because it is easier to be lazy. Seeing that
everything is going perfectly well, and women are doing perfectly well,
the natural instinct is to fall into laziness; there is no need for you
to do anything. But this is a wrong way of thinking. When women are
doing so much, at least you have to prove your equality. You cannot
prove that you are superior – forget it, that is completely out of the
question – but you can at least prove yourself equal.</p><p>I know you cannot produce children. That inferiority in you is to be
used as another opportunity. Down the centuries man has been using that,
and you are not to forget it. Man has created great music, great art,
great poetry, great drama, great sculpture. Women have not done
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place they were not allowed. In the second place, to
give birth to a child, a living child, is such a great creative act that
they don’t feel they have to make a dead statue. Leonardo da Vinci may
make beautiful statue of Jesus Christ, but it does not breathe. Mary,
who gave birth to Jesus, is far superior. Howsoever beautiful the
statue, it is just a dead stone. Jesus was an alive human being. So the
woman has no inferiority complex in her.</p><p>I would like you to be creative. Man has to prove his equality, and
he can prove his equality only by creating. And there is so much to
create! We are in a desert, and we have to create a lush, green oasis.
We are surrounded by all kind of hostile forces. We have to be strong
enough to face them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a great encounter between the past and the future. We have to
stand for the future; they are standing for the past. Those who stand
for the past miss the present. Those who stand for the future have to
take care of the present, because the present is going to become the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t get lazy because women are doing perfectly well, taking all the
responsible jobs in the commune. Gather yourself together, take
responsibility. Of course you cannot give birth to a child – there is no
need – but you can give birth to many things which the woman may not be
attracted to. Yes, beautiful paintings are needed, beautiful gardens are
needed, beautiful lakes are needed; beautiful music, poetry, literature,
are needed.</p><p>Perhaps the woman may not feel attracted. She is already a creator, a
born creator. Man is not a born creator. Unless you make the effort to
be a creator – that is, to be a painter, or a gardener,</p><p><br></p><p>or a farmer – you are bound to fall into laziness. And laziness is a
slow death. You cannot live life abundantly if you are lazy; life needs
strength, overflowing energy. You cannot even love, because you don’t
have any juice to share. You are becoming a dry bone.</p><p>I have been receiving letters from women sannyasins, asking, “What is
happening? In the whole world, man chases the woman. Here we have to
chase men – and they escape!” This is ugly. This is humiliating yourself
– or have you become so lazy that you cannot even chase a woman? Do you
want a rocking chair? The women can provide you with a rocking chair –
so sit on the rocking chair. But you cannot even sit there, because
women will be chasing you. They are full of juice and they want to share
it, and it can be shared only with somebody who is equally
overflowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Our commune is proving something significant. It is proving that if
women are given the opportunity, they will prove far superior to
men.</p><p>And if women are given the opportunity, the man will become lazier.
They will not feel competent enough, so rather than joining in the race,
it is safer for their egos to sit by the side of the road. But that is a
kind of suicide. You have to take the challenge. Come out of your
laziness! And you become juicier only when you are creative. That’s why
poets, painters, musicians, are more juicy than others – even if they
are creating third-rate music.</p><p>The music of the Beatles has not to be called music, it is sheer
madness. You cannot put the Beatles in the same company with Mozart,
Wagner, Tansen. What the Beatles are doing is just something monkeyish,
and naturally their music is finished; the Beatles are past already.
Mozart is going to live forever. As long as humanity is there, and
intelligent people are there, he will be alive. The Beatles were
finished within ten years – came like a wind, and went away.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to create something in which your inner potentiality becomes
actualized, materialized. And then you will be surprised that the more
you create, the juicier you become. Poets have always attracted
beautiful women, painters have always attracted beautiful women. Any
kind of creativity makes you juicier. The woman knows where the juice
is; it is her natural instinct. And what is the point of falling in love
with a lazy skeleton?</p><p>So stop escaping from women. Start chasing them, because it is
absolutely unacceptable... for the simple reason that the natural
phenomenon – not only in man, but all over in nature – is that the male
chases the female, and the female tries to escape, although she does not
want to escape. She goes very slowly, she goes on looking back. But it
is a beautiful game of hide-and-seek. The woman, all over nature, is the
one who hides. It is the man, the male who seeks. We cannot change
nature, and if you try to change it you become something of a
perversion. The game is so joyous.…</p><p><br></p><p>Chase the woman, because that gives her strength, recognition; that
makes her feel she is attractive, beautiful, wanted. And that is a great
need in the feminine psychology: to be wanted. Don’t take away something
from my women here, because it is absolutely unnatural for them to chase
men. It is unfeminine, it is not ladylike.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what this word “lady” means, but I figured out it means
“a good lay.” I don’t know English, so I can manage my own meanings.
Now, a good lay has to be chased. The good lay is not going to chase
you, that will look unfeminine. Be a gentleman! And just as I think lady
means a good lay, a gentleman means one who lays her gently. And you are
chasing.…</p><p><br></p><p>Chase the woman gently. And let her feel one of her greatest needs:
that she is needed. That will make her juicier. And chasing her, you
will come out of your laziness, so it is just the right thing to do.</p><p>If any man is not chasing a woman he is betraying me! I have chased
women my whole life – of course, very gently. And you guys here are
trying to destroy the whole natural balance! A woman loves immensely to
be chased, it is her inner necessity. Don’t deprive the woman of her
most basic need.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a lecturer in the university... just by coincidence I was
sitting with the vice-chancellor – he had called me to discuss a few
things about my behavior – and at that very moment a girl student came
in. She was in tears.</p><p><br></p><p>The vice-chancellor asked her, “What is the matter?”</p><p>She said, “Look at these letters! A few boys go on continuously
writing me love letters. They even throw pebbles at me. They are
harassing me!”</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally the vice-chancellor said, “You just name those people, they
will be punished.”</p><p>I said, “Wait. You don’t understand psychology. Let me take the case
in hand. I am teaching psychology – you don’t know anything about it.”
He was shocked that a lecturer should say that. But it was absolutely
certain that he had no idea of psychology. He had been the chief justice
of a high court.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not a court. You know how to deal with criminals, but
this is not a crime. In fact, if this woman receives no letters, if
nobody pays any attention to her, nobody chases her, nobody throws
pebbles at her, she will be in great despair.”</p><p>The girl was shocked, but her tears disappeared. I said to her, “Just
look within yourself. Don’t you enjoy all those letters? Don’t you enjoy
all those people chasing you? Are you not creating jealousy in the other
girls of your class?”</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment she was dumb. Then she said, “Of course, perhaps you are
right. Perhaps I had come with these letters to show to the
vice-chancellor just to make it known that I am the most chased girl in
the whole university.”</p><p>I said, “You are intelligent, you have understood the point.” And I
said to the vice-chancellor, “Never interfere in things which you don’t
know about.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is an absolute need in feminine psychology, and it is a very
complicated phenomenon. If she is not chased, she is in despair. That
means she is worthless, nobody is paying attention to her, nobody writes
love letters, nobody approaches her. Nobody tells her, in a roundabout
way, that he loves her. She is waiting<span class=s6></span>Don’t let
my women wait!</p><p>And out of despair a woman starts chasing men, because she sees time
is passing – and time passes faster for the woman than it passes for the
man. Because she is a beautiful flower, delicate</p><p><br></p><p>in every way, her youth, her beauty will be soon gone. By the time
she is forty-eight her menopause comes, and after that who bothers to
chase her? She is in a hurry: youth will not be forever.</p><p>A man can be loved even when he is old. This is strange. You will
find many young girls falling in love with an old poet, who is older
than their fathers, an old painter, an old musician – young girls. I
know twenty-year-old girls were falling in love with Picasso. And it has
been always so, never the reverse.</p><p>I have never seen a young man falling in love with an old woman of
seventy, eighty, ninety. And if any young man falls in love with a woman
who is ninety, the motivation must be different. It must be money. The
woman is just about to go into her grave – it is not difficult for a few
days to pretend that he loves her, and then all her money is going to be
his. But no young man is going to fall really in love with an old
woman.</p><p>The woman’s beauty, youth, is a very fleeting phenomenon. So she
becomes despairing, afraid; time is running out and these lazy guys are
not chasing her! Now, don’t be so cruel, don’t be so unkind. Be human,
compassionate.</p><p>This word “compassion” is composed of passion. To be compassionate
means to be in love. Compassion is just a dimension of love. Passion is
hasty, hectic, a little violent. Compassion is gentle, nice,
understanding – but it is passion after all.</p><p>It has to be remembered that when a woman out of despair chases a
man, the man is bound to escape because something unnatural is
happening. When the woman chases you, it simply means she is an unwanted
woman, nobody is chasing her. The woman chasing the man becomes
unattractive. The man cannot take it: she is not a woman, she is a
monster.</p><p>Things are very much correlated. If women start chasing, men are
bound to escape. The whole game has turned upside down. The chaser
becomes the chased, and no man can love a woman who is chasing him. The
very phenomenon of chasing makes the woman worthless, she is not a
challenge. Man wants challenge. He wants to chase, he wants to be
victorious. That’s why nature has arranged it in such a way that in all
the animals, man included, the males should chase the females.</p><p>Give great contentment to the woman. And don’t be worried that you
will have to chase her to the very end of the earth. She is willing, she
is just giving you a little more chance to chase her, so it becomes a
more attractive challenge. And once you start burning with the
challenge, the woman becomes almost a fairy, not of this world. Your
burning desire for her makes her a dream girl. You dream of her, you
think of her, you write poetry, you play on the guitar. It is perfectly
good.</p><p>And never be worried. She is not trying to escape you, she is just
giving you a chance to chase. Take the challenge as a man, and soon she
will allow you to be victorious. And that’s what the man desires:
victory. But when a woman chases a man it is going to be defeat. If she
catches hold of him, he is defeated. He will fall on his knees and beg
her, “Please leave me, find someone else. I am not one to be
defeated.”</p><p>So just understand the natural way of things, and don’t go against
nature, because going against nature creates all sorts of problems. To
be natural is to be unproblematic. And to be natural is so
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>To be natural is so at ease, at home.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM ONE OF YOUR BLACK <span class=s10>SANNYASINS. MY</span>
CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT IN AFRICA, MY FAMILY LIVES THERE. I HAVE BEEN WITH
YOU FOR TEN YEARS, AND I’VE PUT ASIDE MY QUESTIONS ABOUT AFRICA. NOW I
FIND THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND AFRICA MAKES ME
FEEL RAW AND SHAKY. I FEEL ASHAMED AS WELL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS
HAPPENING? I AM GLAD THAT IT IS HAPPENING, BUT IT HURTS.</p><p>Yes. I am also glad that it is happening. Go through the process.
Something in your mind is still thinking in terms of white and
black.</p><p><br></p><p>My commune has nothing to do with white and black. My commune is open
to all with equal respect. Just look at me. I am neither black nor
white, but it does not give me any trouble. I simply enjoy it. Not being
black, not being white, with one hand I can chase a black woman, with
another hand I can chase a white woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, my ways of chasing are very subtle. I chase them sitting
in my chair. I don’t have to do all kinds of gymnastics. I don’t have to
take them to the cafe, to the restaurant, to the movie; I am simply
sitting in my chair. But even if I look in their eyes, that is enough:
cafes and restaurants and movies are nothing before it. Just waving my
hand... and I see the woman becoming so happy. It makes me happy in
return. And I have not done anything – just waved my hand!</p><p>When I see you laughing, it is a nourishment to me. When I see you
singing and dancing with me, I become healthier. What medicines cannot
do for me, my people, rejoicing, do.</p><p>Feel for everybody who is here. Don’t think in terms of you being
black. Black is beautiful – it has its own beauty, just as the white
color has its own beauty. The black color is not to be condemned; the
black color and the black people have to be discovered and welcomed.
They are stronger than white people. White husbands are always afraid of
black servants, chauffeurs, for the simple reason that their wives might
find them more attractive. And certainly they are more powerful sexually
– they are more primitive!</p><p><br></p><p>And they come from a world where only strong people can survive.
Those who are weaker will not be able to take the sun of Africa; they
will be finished.</p><p>In Tibet, for centuries there has been a tradition that when the
child is born You cannot conceive</p><p>what they do. They dip the child into ice-cold water nine times. A
very strange thing! Nine children die; only one survives out of ten. But
I know their reason. In Tibet, to survive you will need immense strength
against the cold. It is icy cold all around. It is better to die in the
very beginning, better to get out of the race. Otherwise, you will be
continually sick, a burden on the society, on the parents, who are all
poor, and you will carry a guilt within yourself your whole life – that
you are of no use, worthless and unnecessarily existing like a
parasite.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks cruel to dip the just-born child into ice-cold water, but I
can see their point. It is better to retire from the very beginning,
rather than suffer for seventy years. So only ten percent of children
survive, ninety percent die in that ice-cold dipping. But those who
survive are immensely strong.</p><p>The same is the situation in Africa. They have to be strong, the sun
is too much. Their blackness is really a protection against the sun.
Their strength has been always a point of jealousy in white people’s
minds; in fact, the white man has always felt inferior. And just to
destroy that inferiority within himself, he forced the black people to
be inferior. He made them slaves, he sold them in the markets like a
commodity. They were not given education, they were not economically
free. They were always second-class citizens.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, in the twentieth century, in the most modern country of the
world – in America – the blacks are still fighting for their rights, and
they are not receiving them. But in my commune, which is ahead of
time... in my commune it is the twenty-first century! We have left the
twentieth century far behind. Here, every color is respected.</p><p><br></p><p>You say you have been with me for ten years. Not really, if you had
been really with me for ten years it would be impossible for this
question to arise in your mind. Yes, I have never talked about Africa,
because nobody ever asked about Africa, nobody ever asked about the
African people.</p><p><br></p><p>I answer your questions; otherwise, I have nothing to say. I have
found the answer, now no question arises in me.</p><p>If you want to drink out of my experience, you have to use your
question as a bucket is used to draw water from a well. The well is not
in any need of your bucket, he is perfectly contented. But he is happy
to give you water, to fill your bucket, because he knows the more he
gives, the more water – fresh, younger – flows in through hundreds of
sources.</p><p>The same is my experience. You go on asking me and I will go on
answering you. But if you don’t ask, there is absolute silence in me.
There is no question that has arisen in thirty-two years. Once you have
found the answer, how can questions arise? But you have questions; use
them as buckets. I am available, infinitely happy to give you all that I
have, because the more I give, the fuller I am.</p><p>You have been with me physically for ten years, but somewhere lurking
in your mind the idea has remained that you are a black person. And the
white people have conditioned you to think that you are inferior. Just
now, because somebody in the press conference asked me about Africans –
why they are not coming here – the shadow that has been always lurking
somewhere in your unconscious came into your conscious immediately. And
my answer may have helped to bring it up.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no other way to get rid of things. If you go on keeping them
deep in your unconscious, you may be unaware of them but they are there
and growing their roots deeper and deeper. Underneath your unconscious
mind there is a collective unconscious mind – which is far bigger.
Underneath your collective unconscious mind is the cosmic unconscious
mind – which is as big as the whole universe. So the deeper you repress
something, the more you are giving it chances to survive. Bring it into
the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that somebody asked the question, and you have become
disturbed, shaky. Don’t repress</p><p>it. Shake yourself perfectly well!</p><p><br></p><p>There used to be – there is still in some areas – a Christian sect
called Shakers. I condemn their whole theology, but I accept their
shaking. That’s what they used to do in their churches: they would shake
themselves as strongly as possible till they fell on the ground. I call
it Dynamic Meditation!</p><p>There has been another Christian sect which was even better; they are
called Quakers. Shaking is a little bit gentle, but quaking is as if an
earthquake is happening. And that’s what they used to do. I don’t accept
anything of their theology, but shaking and quaking are perfectly useful
methods.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are shaking inside, bring it out. And what has shaken you?
– I said a truth. And I cannot say anything else. That’s why I am
against taking the oath in the courts. The oath in the courts means that
if you don’t take the oath you are liable to lie. That is accepting that
you are a lying person. I am against the oaths in the courts, for the
simple reason that they are already giving the judgment, without you
asserting a single word. They have already judged: “You will lie, so
take the oath.”</p><p>But it is so stupid. If a person can lie, how can the oath prevent
him? And particularly a person like me, who does not believe in God, who
does not believe in heaven and hell – what oath can prevent me from
lying? There is no fear of hell, there is no greed for heaven, and I
don’t want to meet your bogus God. I am completely fulfilled in myself.
The oath can make superstitious people afraid; the oath can make a
Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan afraid. The oath cannot make my people
afraid – there is nothing to fear.</p><p><br></p><p>I am simply saying the truth as I see it. That’s what has shaken you.
But what can I do? If there are people who don’t listen to Mozart, is
Mozart responsible for that? If there are people who cannot understand
the paintings of Van Gogh, is Van Gogh responsible for it? To understand
Van Gogh you will have to grow more sensitive, more aesthetic; you will
have to understand the mind of a creative painter.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I saw a picture of Van Gogh’s painting. Why has
this picture suddenly been published? Van Gogh was condemned for this
same painting for his whole life, and even after his life. And now
suddenly the painting has become the most important of Van Gogh’s
paintings. I will have to tell you what the painting is and what
happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The painting is of stars, but they are not the way you see them. They
are more whirling, they are not static; they are more liquid than solid.
Now who has seen a liquid star going round and round on its center? In
Van Gogh’s time, science itself condemned it as only imaginary. But now
physicists have discovered that the stars are actually as they are
painted by Van Gogh; they are liquid and whirling, they are not solid,
static.</p><p>Something almost miraculous... Van Gogh could see something that
science had to wait for one hundred years to discover. And now they are
all paying respect to the genius of the man, to his unimaginable
intuitive forces. How did he manage to see stars the way they are? If
you want to understand Van Gogh, you will have to raise your
consciousness. You cannot appreciate Van Gogh just the way you are;
there is a gap.</p><p><br></p><p>If Africans are not coming to me, it is not my fault. There is a big
gap, they cannot understand me. Their problems are not spiritual – why
should they come to me? Their problems are very material,</p><p><br></p><p>mundane. They need food, they need water, clean water. They need
medicine, they need hospitals, they need schools. They need all kinds of
things; and I am not distributing things here.</p><p>Only those who have everything and still find themselves
discontented, who have all kinds of power and still feel they are empty;
those who have been educated in the great universities of the world –
Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Varanasi – and still they find, after all
this long process of education, wasting one-third of their lives What
have they got? A few papers certifying that they are an M.A., a</p><p>Ph.D., a D.Litt., but their ignorance remains the same after all this
knowledgeability.</p><p>They have not become knowers, they don’t know even themselves. All
these universities – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Varanasi – they all
have failed them, they have deceived them. They have not been true to
their promise. Out of the university they come full of knowledgeability,
but with no experience of their own: all knowledge borrowed, but no
experience authentically their own. These are the people who will be
coming to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Africans, I am sad to say, cannot come. But I am not responsible for
it. It is not a question of their being black, it is a question of their
poverty, their slavery. And as far as religion is concerned, I am
condemning all the religions, because I find them pseudo, not true;
mythological, not existential. The Africans are not even at that stage
where they have a pseudo religion. They are far away, back in the world
when there was no religion, only magical rituals.</p><p>I am condemning the religious people. What can I say to Africans who
are five thousand years behind? They are still believing that a certain
ritual can kill a man, that a certain ritual can save a man from dying,
that a certain ritual can do miracles. There is such a gap! That’s why
they are not coming to me. You are fortunate that you have come and you
have been here with me for ten years.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t ever discriminate between the black people and the white
people. To me, anybody who is trying to seek, search inwards.… Inside
nobody is black and nobody is white. Inside there are no colors. Inside
it is luminous whiteness. Remember, white is not a color, just as black
is not a color. It is strange that we say black people, white people;
both are colorless, in different ways.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see in the rainbow you will not find white and black. These
two colors you will not find in</p><p>the rainbow; all other colors are there. Why is the rainbow not
interested in white and black? –</p><p>because they are not colors. Black simply means that all colors have
been absorbed.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand a little bit of scientific fact. When you see
something black, that means none of the sunrays falling on it are
reflected back. It absorbs them, it does not let any sunray escape.
White does just the opposite. It reflects all the rays, and all the
colors together create the illusion of white.</p><p><br></p><p>You can try it. Just on your ceiling fan, instead of three blades,
put seven blades. Paint each blade in different colors – paint on it all
seven rainbow colors. Then put the fan on, and you will be surprised:
when those blades start moving fast, you only see white; all those
colors have disappeared.</p><p>The reflection of all colors is white; rejecting all the colors is
white. Absorbing all sunrays is black. The black people had to be black
because they had to absorb the sunrays; otherwise they would be too
much, they would kill them. They had to create a device, a simple device
– to be black. It is not</p><p><br></p><p>very costly, it is a very small amount of pigment. Things are
becoming more and more costly, but still the black pigment is not more
than half a dollar’s worth. But it protects them from being burned by
the sun, because the black immediately absorbs sunrays.</p><p>The white cannot accept all the sunrays; that is also simple. The
white races live in colder countries where the sunrays are not so
strong. To survive they don’t need to be able to absorb all the sunrays.
These are survival measures – don’t make politics out of them!</p><p><br></p><p>And as far as your inside is concerned, there are no colors, just a
luminosity, just pure light and utter silence. It is the same in the
black, in the white, in the yellow, in the brown – it does not matter
what kind of container you have, the content is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>You are fortunate, I say it again, to have been here for ten years.
But do you remember anybody discriminating against you because you are
black? In fact, I had to enquire who the questioner is, because I don’t
see you as black and white; I simply see you as red people! My concern
is with the red people.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you got disturbed. But it is not your responsibility.
It is nobody’s responsibility, it just happens that the black people
have not risen in consciousness, in intelligence. They have been
struggling at the lowest level of survival.</p><p>The same is the situation in India. There was a time, twenty-five
centuries ago when Gautam Buddha was alive, when the country was agog
with arguments, philosophies, theologies. There were wandering masters
all over the country discussing things of the beyond, searching for
methods of meditation, contemplation, concentration. The country was not
at the survival level; the country was perfectly happy, their basic
needs were fulfilled. And when the basic needs are fulfilled, suddenly
you find new needs of a higher order arising in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think a hungry man should come to me to ask about meditation?
A hungry man will come to ask about bread and butter. And if I start
talking about meditation to him, he will say, “First give me something
to eat so that I can at least hear you, what you are saying.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, there has been a great fall. After Gautam Buddha, India
went down and down and down. Alexander the Great reached India three
hundred years after Gautam Buddha, and after Alexander the Great, India
became a constant target of invaders of all kinds, of all countries –
whoever wanted to loot. India became a victim for two thousand years. It
lost its glory, it lost its spiritual interest.</p><p><br></p><p>I was there for seven years in Poona, and people were asking why
Indians don’t come to me. When people from all over the world are
coming, why are Indians not coming to me? Or even if they come, they are
only few and far between, and they are all rich people who come.</p><p>I said, “It is so simple. The whole of India is struggling at the
lowest level, trying somehow to manage to survive.” When somebody is
drowning in a river, do you think he will ask a question about
meditation? He will say, “Save me! Take me out of the water!”</p><p><br></p><p>You can tell him, “The best way is meditation. Don’t be worried about
the water, everybody has to die someday. Die meditatively. Celebrate!
And I will participate in celebration from the bank. I will</p><p><br></p><p>dance and sing and play on the guitar, and you die joyously.” That
man is not going to forgive you. If somehow he comes out, he is going to
break your guitar and your neck and teach you a lesson, that this is not
the way to behave with a drowning man!</p><p>In India the poor people were not coming to me. Those who were coming
were either the upper middle class people or the super-rich. But it is
not my fault that Indians are poor. It is their own responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>What have Africans been doing for five thousand years? If Africa was
not able to provide a higher standard of life, they should have moved.
Who is preventing them? But they are clinging, just as in India the
farmers go on clinging – and eighty percent of India consists of
farmers. They go on clinging to their small pieces of land, which have
been exploited by their crops for centuries: now the land doesn’t have
anything to give. But they are clinging, starving.</p><p>The gap is big I can tell them how to bridge the gap, but there were
two African journalists in the</p><p>world press conference, and I could see they could not understand
what I was saying. And they were journalists, educated. In fact, they
could not ask the question itself adequately.</p><p><br></p><p>One was standing in front of me, trying to make an effort to question
me, but he was going in a strange round and round way. I could not see
what he was trying to ask. And when I figured it out and I answered him,
he did not listen – because my answer was finished and he was still
standing there like a rock. Everybody else asked the question, received
the answer, and immediately moved away to give place to somebody else.
But this man was just standing there. He had not even enough
intelligence to know that my answer was finished. He looked absolutely
like an idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>The second African asked the question better than the first; it was
perfectly clear. Perhaps he was preparing it, rehearsing it, cramming
it, because I could see that he must have crammed the question. And I
have reason to say that – because when I started answering him, he would
not look at me. He was looking here, he was looking there. Except at me,
he was looking everywhere. In fact, he was cramming, inside, the second
question. He did not want to get disturbed by my answer – he might
forget the second question.</p><p><br></p><p>As my answer was finished.… If you have to ask a second question, it
has to be related to my answer. But his second question was absolutely
unrelated to my answer. Now what can I do?</p><p><br></p><p>You ask, “Why are Africans not coming?” in such a way – as if I am
responsible for the fact that they are not coming. They cannot. They are
not even contemporaries, what to say about the twenty-first century?
They are five thousand years old – stuck, fossilized.</p><p><br></p><p>You are certainly blessed to be here, and any idea of black, of
Africa – I am going to hammer all those things out of you. It will be
good if you drop them yourself, just to be compassionate to me.</p><p>Hammering is not for a lazy man like me – and I am not a blacksmith
either!</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>28</span></p><p><br></p><p>Death never happens</p><p><br></p><p>26 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A MAN LIKE YOU COMES ALONG ONCE IN ETERNITY. WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING
AND SAYING IS UNIQUE. I’M INDEED FORTUNATE TO BE HERE AND I MAY NEVER
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. YET EVERY MORNING I COME TO DISCOURSE, I
FALL ASLEEP. AM I MISSING? SHOULD I ALSO GO AND JUMP IN KRISHNAMURTI
LAKE?</p><p>It is just great – have a good sleep! Sleep is not contradictory to
enlightenment. You will make history by becoming enlightened in your
sleep. And there is no need to go to Krishnamurti Lake. I am here – your
Krishnamurti Lake</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t say that what I am saying is unique. It is simply the
truth. Anybody who is ready to relax in his ordinariness will realize
it. And it is not that a man like me comes only once in an eternity. You
all have the same potential.</p><p>Only men like me are born; there are no other kind. Just don’t try to
become somebody. That’s why I am saying. Don’t call me unique; otherwise
you will start unconsciously trying to become unique. And the moment you
go on the trip of becoming, you are going far away from the truth that
you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be ordinary! It is beautiful and so relaxing. It is the most
wondrous experience just to be nobody, not desiring to be somewhere
else, not even thinking of the tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you see this very moment the bliss that is descending upon you?
Can’t you feel the silence that is beating in your very heart?</p><p><br></p><p>It is here – and not unique, available to all. And it is not that you
have to wait for an eternity, don’t find excuses. I am not going to let
you go without experiencing it. It is not something to be given to you;
you have it already. Just go on relaxing, sleeping.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I feel like sleeping; I can manage both to sleep and talk.
Perhaps a few times I fall asleep and just out of habit I go on talking
– you can ask Vivek. Once in a while when she comes to wake me up, she
cannot believe it – I am addressing you! But the trouble for the poor
girl is, when I speak in my sleep I speak my mother tongue. But I have
promised her next time I will remember to speak in English.</p><p>Life in all its dimensions – awake or asleep – makes no difference to
your enlightenment. So don’t find any excuse. These are excuses: that it
happens only in an eternity, how can it happen to you? It happens only
to unique people, how can it happen to you? I am trying my best to
destroy these tricks of the mind, so that nobody who is a sannyasin
leaves this world unenlightened!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>RECENTLY YOU SAID THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO BECOME ENLIGHTENED DIE SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW YOU HAVE MANAGED TO STAY WITH US
SO LONG? I AM SO GRATEFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>Really I should be grateful to you. It is love for you, and the love
that you go on pouring upon me that has helped me to remain with you.
Love is a spiritual nourishment.</p><p>Those who died after their enlightenment died because they thought
they had found it and now there was no reason to live. When I found it,
I said to myself, “Now there is every reason to live.” Before finding,
there was no reason; I could have died easily. But after my finding it,
my love would not let me die. I waited for you, and you started coming.
I have not sent a message, not written a letter. Still, from faraway
lands you started coming, as if you have always belonged to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I am part of you, you are part of me. It is going to be very
difficult for death to take me away from so many people, from your love:
I am protected.</p><p>Love is the antidote of death, not life.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily you think that life and death are contraries. No, death
and love are the contraries. Now it is going to be a great strain on
death. I should be grateful to you. I have not given anything to you,
there is nothing to give. You have already got it. At the most I go on
shaking you, shocking you, hitting you. Do you think that is giving?</p><p><br></p><p>But you have loved me – a man who does not deserve anybody’s love. I
am immensely grateful to</p><p>the sannyasins. You are my life! If you are with me, there is no
death. If you are not with me, then</p><p><br></p><p>this very moment I will be gone. It is your love which is keeping me
breathing, living; it is your joy, your blissfulness, your songs, your
dances.</p><p>In the night when I go to sleep, I tell death, “At least don’t
disturb my morning. My people will be waiting to burst into singing.” I
am alive because so many people would like me to be alive. Existence
cannot go against so much love. Existence cannot do anything without the
permission of so many people. Death has to wait!</p><p><br></p><p>It all depends on you. My work is done as far as I am concerned.
There is nothing more to experience, nothing more to know. But I have
become so much concerned with you that it does not matter that my work
is finished; there are so many people who love me whose work is not
finished. I have to live, to find ways and means to postpone death.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am very stubborn. I have struggled with life, and I have been
victorious. Death is a poor thing; if I can be victorious in life, I can
easily keep death waiting outside the door. I will allow it in only when
I see that you are awake, that your consciousness has arisen, that even
if I am not here you will continue my work, you will go on spreading the
fire around the world. But please, just to keep me alive don’t go on
sleeping</p><p>There are so many – eight hundred thousand – sannyasins around the
world. It is going to be a difficult task for death to take me away from
my people. I am not alone, I have penetrated into your beings. I have
dispersed myself into so many beings that it is almost impossible for
death to collect me unless I help.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t just feel grateful. If you are grateful, it is good, but not
enough. Become what you are, be what</p><p>you are. Let me rejoice! My only joy is to see somebody coming
home.</p><p><br></p><p>I will wait till eternity. You can go on and on befooling yourself,
but remember – I am waiting, and I want you to be enlightened. I want it
to become the most important historical fact in human existence, that
thousands of people relax into their ordinariness and become
enlightened. Yes, in the past it was so that after thousands of years
one person may become enlightened. I don’t live in that bullock-cart
age, I am a contemporary man. I want you to become enlightened with jet
speed – and it is possible. I am not asking the impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>You have given so much to me. You go on giving so much to me.</p><p>I wonder... what have I done? Where have I gone wrong? – that so many
people for no reason go on pouring their love on one who deserves
nothing. And your love goes on growing. As your love goes on growing, I
become healthier and healthier.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon I am going to dance with you! Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE IN YOUR CHILDHOOD, I
FEEL CONNECTED TO THAT, BECAUSE I DID THE SAME. I STRUGGLED HARD NOT TO
BE REPRESSED, BUT SOMEHOW THEY GOT ME IN THE END. HALF-HEARTEDLY I
COMPROMISED. WHY WAS YOUR REBELLION NOT DISTURBED BY ANYTHING?</p><p>The first thing to be remembered by all: never compare yourself with
anybody, not even with me. Everybody is so different, and everybody
passes through different phases, different paths. There is no
similarity.</p><p>Don’t deceive yourself by saying that you have been as rebellious as
I was in my childhood. You were not rebellious, you were only
reactionary. Yes, you fought against repression, but your fight was the
fight of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>My fight was not the fight of the ego. My family, my neighbors, my
friends, my teachers, professors – it took a little time for them, but
soon they realized that I was not struggling for my ego. Soon it became
clear to them that my struggle had a totally different quality to it. I
was struggling to find myself. I was struggling so that they could not
create a false ego as a substitute for my self.</p><p><br></p><p>You say you have been struggling – but remember, your struggle was an
ego fighting. That’s where you failed. Your ego became strong, and
remember, even the strongest ego is prone to compromise. It can fight if
that fulfills it; it can compromise if that fulfills it. Why did you
compromise? What can the world do to you? At the most they can kill you.
The rebel from the very beginning decides, “I would prefer to accept
death but I will not compromise.”</p><p><br></p><p>You were not fighting, struggling, to destroy your ego. You were
fighting to strengthen it, to make it more powerful. And then a moment
came when you were powerful enough – now struggle was useless,
unnecessary trouble; you could compromise. Your struggle has been
reactionary and political; that’s why you failed.</p><p><br></p><p>My struggle was totally different. I was continuously watching that
my rebellion remained pure, that it was not polluted by reaction.</p><p>They look alike. When you don’t follow an order from your father,
your mother, it can be either reaction or rebellion. They look very
similar; they are as far apart from each other as two things can be, but
the appearance is very similar. And it is very easy to believe that you
are a rebel. All reactionaries believe that they are rebellious spirits.
In fact, that too fulfills their ego – that they are not ordinary
people, they are rebellious people.</p><p>Reaction means your ego does not want to be dominated by anyone; on
the contrary, you would like to dominate everybody. Once it becomes
strong through struggle, once you are certain that now nobody can
destroy your ego, you start compromising. There is no need to fight, you
can manage things now through compromise – a far easier way. Compromise
– the very word is not in my vocabulary.</p><p><br></p><p>Compromise is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Rebellion is either/or, it never compromises.</p><p><br></p><p>How can truth compromise with lies? Either the truth has to prevail,
or death. And when you have a small taste of truth, who cares about
death? because that very small taste of truth makes you immortal. Deep
down you know death is a fallacy: nobody dies, so what is the fear? At
the most you can get a new body instead of the old. So far, so good.
Getting rid of the old model and finding the fresh, new, latest model of
the body – it is a beautiful experience.</p><p>But to see that death is a fallacy, it never really happens, you
never die, nobody dies, nothing dies.… Yes it can change forms, but life
is eternal. Compromise means you have become a strong ego. Now you do
not need to struggle; now you can manage through compromise to get
whatsoever you want. Once the ego is certain, then compromise is bound
to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never compromised on anything with anybody, for the simple
reason that I have made it plain to everybody who has come into my life:
if you are true, I am with you; it is not a compromise. I am totally
with you, I don’t make any conditions. But if I am true, you have to
remember that you will have to be with me without any conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither I compromise with anybody, nor do I allow anybody else to
compromise with me. I have never compromised and I have never allowed
anybody to compromise with me. Compromise is not my game. This is
possible only if you are not trying to strengthen your ego.</p><p><br></p><p>For ego, it makes no difference: struggle is okay if it is
nourishment for the ego, compromise is okay if it is nourishment for the
ego. The ego wants to remain – it can use any means. There is no
question of deciding what is right, what is wrong. For the ego, anything
that keeps it strong is right – might is right. So if you can get
something through compromise, why should you bother to fight? Yes, if
you cannot get it through compromise, you are ready to struggle, to
fight, to do anything that you are capable of.</p><p><br></p><p>This must have been your situation – just look back. What I am
saying, try to find out... be just a fair judge of your own past,
because if you had been rebellious like me, I cannot conceive that there
came a point where you compromised. In rebellion there never comes a
point of compromise. Only in reaction is there a point of
compromise.</p><p><br></p><p>Your word “compromise” makes me absolutely certain what it was – not
rebellion but reaction. You say, “In the end they got me.” Why? If you
were so strong in the beginning, in the end you would have been even
more strong, all the years of struggle would have sharpened your sword.
But if in the end you compromise, that simply means now you have come to
a higher position as far as ego is concerned. Now there is no fear; you
can compromise and still go on becoming bigger and bigger as an ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing came in my way. You are asking, “Why did this happen to you
and not to me?” We were working from totally different standpoints. I
was not reactionary; hence, even the people with whom I fought had
tremendous love for me, they never became my enemies. I fought with my
father, I fought with my mother, but they both became sannyasins. It is
a rare phenomenon. They knew that I was not fighting with them for my
ego. Just the contrary: I was fighting so that they should not be able
to create an ego in me.</p><p><br></p><p>I received their blessings always. It looks very strange that the
people with whom I was fighting were always blessing me. What was the
cause of it? They could see clearly that I was absolutely simple</p><p><br></p><p>and humble. I was not trying my ego against their ego. My teachers
loved me. My professors wept when I left the university. The same
professors who were continually bothered by me, they wept.</p><p>I asked them, “What is the matter? You should be happy that you are
getting rid of a great nuisance.” They said, “We will miss you.”</p><p>One of my professors, S.S. Roy, said to me, “I don’t expect to get
another student of your type. For two years you have argued against me,
but I could see that your argument was not an ego trip. You were
sincerely searching for the truth. Students will come,” he said. “I had
students in the past; I will have students in the future. But I do not
see that I will have a student like you, whose effort is not just to
pass examinations, get degrees – in fact who is not interested in the
examinations, not interested in the degrees, not interested in the gold
medals – but is sincerely interested in knowing the truth about
everything.”</p><p>Nobody with whom I have struggled has ended in enmity with me. They
all loved me, they still love me.</p><p><br></p><p>Professor S.S. Roy, with whom I fought the most, was one of the most
intelligent people I have come across, and it was a joy to argue with
him. Our arguments were never finished in the class, so I had to follow
him to his home. By and by, his wife also became involved. And S.S.Roy
said to his wife, “This is strange, you always seem to be on his side.
He is enough! If you want to support somebody, support me! He will kill
the arguments of both of us.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife said, “But he’s so true and so sincere – not interested in
defeating you. You are interested in defeating him. I have been watching
the scene continuously. He is trying to figure out what is the truth,
and you are trying somehow to prove that your argument is right. I am
going to be on his side. And if you have guts. you should also be on his
side.”</p><p><br></p><p>S.S.Roy told me later on, “This is the first time my wife has been so
strong. It must be your doing. She has adored me always, she has
believed me to be one of the most intelligent people in the world. You
destroyed everything. Now she thinks you are far better.”</p><p>I asked S.S.Roy, “What do you think?” He said, “My wife is
right.”</p><p>He is still alive. Anybody who is my sannyasin is received in his
home in Allahabad with the same respect that he would give to me, with
the same love. One of my sannyasins who lived in Allahabad said, “It is
strange. He is a retired head of the department of philosophy of
Allahabad University” – in India, Allahabad University has the best
philosophical department – “and he is a dignified old man. But whenever
I go to him, he simply asks, ‘Have you received any new book, new
magazine? Just say something to me, what is he doing now?’”</p><p><br></p><p>He is one of those rare people who can respect somebody who is not in
any way equal to him. I was just a student; he was the head of the
department and the dean of the faculty of arts – one of the most
dignified persons in the university. He had every chance to become the
vice-chancellor, he just</p><p><br></p><p>did not want to become the vice-chancellor – for the simple reason,
he said, “It is enough. I have always wanted to retire and relax and do
something that one of my students has been continuously hammering on my
head: meditate. Now I am old and I don’t want to waste time in being the
vice- chancellor.”</p><p>Retired, he is doing my meditations. And once in a while somebody
will come and tell me, “He has a picture of you in his room where he
meditates. His wife thinks now he has gone crazy – doing dynamic
meditation in his old age.”</p><p>Revolution – reaction – and rebellion have a totally different
flavor. Reaction is ugly. You simply react because you don’t want
anybody to have the upper hand. But one day when you find you can have
the upper hand without struggle, you start compromising; that’s why
those people could get you in the end. It was your basic
misunderstanding. Your reaction, your ego, helped you to fall into the
trap.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never reacted to anything, I have rebelled against everything,
and on the path of rebellion there is no compromise. Compromise is
something Jewish! It is something that happens in the marketplace, in
politics. It does not happen in the search for truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But nothing is lost. Get out of your compromises. Forget the past.
Even if there is only one single moment available, one can drop the
whole past and taste the beauty of rebellion. Just a single moment is
needed, a moment of understanding, insight.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not just answering your questions, I am trying to help you to
get an insight. And then your insight will show you the path. In India,
we call that insight the third eye. I am trying somehow... please open
your third eye, so you can see clearly and straight.</p><p>It is a miracle to see something clearly. And if you find it is wrong
there is no need to make any effort to drop it. Just in your seeing that
it is wrong, your grip on it is finished, the thing drops out of your
life of its own accord. It is miraculous. It is not that you become
alert, aware, conscious, and then you have to drop this, stop that, do
this, not do that – no. The moment you have the insight, that which is
wrong falls away from you, that which is right you simply follow – no
effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Insight is a miracle, it is magical.</p><p><br></p><p>So my answers are not just answers. My answers are really an effort
to approach your third eye, and somehow make you aware. The moment you
see it was a reaction, not rebellion, you are finished with it. The
moment you see you compromised because you found now it is helpful to
the ego, your compromise is finished. You come out of this imprisonment
of your ego fresh, young, to start your life from the very first moment
– as if you are born again.</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>AFTER YOUR DISCOURSE ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN, I FELT THAT THE MEN ARE
AFRAID. THEY ARE SAYING, TO REASSURE THEMSELVES, “LET’S WAIT TILL
TOMORROW. OSHO WILL PROBABLY SAY THE EXACT OPPOSITE.” COULD YOU
COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to say anything that will be opposite, for the simple
reason that what I said yesterday was not my opinion, it is the law of
nature. If it was my opinion I could have said something opposite to
it.</p><p>So please don’t wait– don’t wait uselessly. It is a law of nature. I
cannot say anything against it. Start chasing the woman! Don’t waste
your time waiting, thinking perhaps I will say the very opposite, that
the women have to chase men. Impossible! I contradict myself, but I
cannot contradict existence.</p><p><br></p><p>I am perfectly a master of my own opinions, to keep them or to throw
them out. But the law of existence can only be understood; you cannot
add anything to it, you cannot deduct anything from it. And what I said
yesterday was simply the law of nature: the feminine has to be chased.
It is manly to chase the woman. To be chased by a woman is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not man enough! Woman are chasing you and you are escaping.
It simply does not look graceful. On your part it is humiliation; on the
part of the woman it is unnatural, ungraceful.</p><p>But why is it happening, that men are afraid? The reason is simple.
In the ordinary society outside they are not afraid, they are chasing
women because it is so difficult. The law is against it, their own wife,
if she finds out, will kill them. The woman they are chasing is somebody
else’s wife – if he finds out, he will start cleaning his gun! It is
difficult. Monogamy has made it very attractive to chase women.</p><p><br></p><p>This society, this commune is completely free from all rubbish of
monogamy, of husbands, of wives; it is completely free. That’s the
trouble. In monogamy you are stuck with one woman, fed up with the
woman; you start chasing another woman. Here the situation is different.
Having a few love affairs New sannyasins chase, then after having a few
love affairs, they feel spent, finished. Now</p><p>they cannot fantasize a woman in their dreams. In their dreams women
disappear. Now, on the contrary, they are afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>And you should remember one thing: that man is the weaker sex. A
woman can have multiple orgasms, can make love many times in one night;
the man is very poor, he can have only one orgasm. And the very
phenomenon of lovemaking is such that the man loses energy in it, the
woman is nourished. She does not lose energy in it, she is the gainer.
And if a man knows many women, sooner or later he becomes aware that
these women are killing him. Now he is not interested in women, he is
interested in saving his life!</p><p>So please, be kind to poor men. They will not be afraid if lovemaking
is not forced on them. They will enjoy cuddling you, they will enjoy the
warmth only a feminine body releases; they will be nourished by it. But
if they know that the woman is bent upon having sexual intercourse, any
intelligent man will be afraid, because tomorrow he has to wake up and
work twelve hours again. And he cannot manage so many women. Once in a
while he may like to make love.…</p><p><br></p><p>So leave men the freedom. When they want to make love to you, enjoy
it. When they want just to lie down by your side, being nourished by
your feminine energy, your warmth, enjoy it. Don’t force them to go into
sexual gymnastics. Then they will not be afraid if they are certain that
when they have the energy they will make love and when they don’t have
the energy they will get warmth, love showered on them by the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be understood, because it is going to be a problem. The
woman has to be a little more understanding. And sexual intercourse is a
very ordinary thing – all the animals are doing it. It needs no
intelligence. If you have intelligence – and you are supposed to have
intelligence – then just be compassionate to the poor man.</p><p>And the man has also to understand, because for centuries he has been
told that he is the stronger sex – that is absolutely wrong – so he
tries to prove that he is the stronger sex. The moment he gets a woman,
or a women gets him, which is far more likely, immediately he is ready
to make love, to prove that he is a strong man. If he does not make love
to the woman, what will the woman think of him?</p><p>Forget this nonsense. If your body, if your energy is not ready to
overflow, just be with the woman, hold her hand, hug her. She will
understand. You are the weaker sex; once you accept the fact, there is
no trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at me. I am only fifty-four and I look so ancient. Do you
know the reason? I went on chasing women all my life! They made me
ancient. What has happened to me, please don’t force on my sannyasins.
Be loving to them, and they will be available, they will not be afraid.
They will not escape and chicken out. They will be immensely happy to be
with any woman who offers her love, her energy, her beauty. But the
problem is sex.</p><p>Never force sex on a man, leave it up to him. If he feels that he has
energy for it, he is free to make love. But if he feels he is tired and
would like simply to be showered with feminine energy, then help him. He
is a weaker sex. Don’t be hard on the poor man.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at my white beard. This is what all the women have done to
me. But I am the type of man who is never afraid. I said, “Even if I
live twenty years less, it does not matter; I am not going to disappoint
a woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a few weeks I have been celibate, that does not mean I have taken
a vow to remain celibate forever. I can take holidays once in a while.
It is nothing spiritual with me.</p><p>Celibacy is every man’s birthright. He needs to gather energy. As he
becomes older, he needs longer periods to gather energy. When a man is
young – I mean, when he is between fourteen and twenty- one – he has the
greatest energy he will have ever in his life. And this society is so
ugly; that is the time when he is not allowed. At that time, in one
night he can make three women, four women, satisfied. But the society
does not allow him. They teach him that he should remain celibate. They
have spread such stupid nonsense about it – that if you are not celibate
you will go crazy, you will become mad.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time he is back home from the university he is already on the
decline. Twenty-five to thirty-five – between these ten tears he will be
declining, he will not have the same energy that he had before. And
after thirty-five it is a very steep fall.</p><p>After fifty he should not go on pretending that he is the same man
that he was when he was twenty- one. He should declare to everybody,
“Now I am fifty, now I am going to be celibate. Yes, once in a while I
will take a holiday from celibacy, but that is going to happen only once
in a while.” That’s why they are afraid. Please don’t make them
afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman’s situation is biologically very different. She loses
nothing in making love, she is always the gainer. Secondly, as she grows
old, she becomes more interested in lovemaking, particularly when she
passes the period of menopause and there is no fear of getting pregnant.
Now she is dangerous to any man; she wants to make love as many times as
possible.</p><p>This was in the past. Now the situation has changed because of the
great revolution: the pill. No woman is afraid of making love. In the
past they were afraid before menopause. Menopause comes nearabout
forty-eight; for forty-eight years they were continuously afraid of
making love, because it meant getting pregnant. It was dangerous –
dangerous to carry the child for nine months, dangerous to feed the
child from your breast and destroy your beauty.</p><p>A woman who has given birth to one dozen children – do you see what
happens to her breasts? They look like Jesus Christ hanging on the
cross. Naturally, women were afraid, and they were not chasing men.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against breast-feeding, because the breast is one of the most
beautiful things of the woman’s body. The child should be given every
chance to play with the mother’s breasts, but as far as feeding is
concerned, some other arrangement has to be made. The woman loses her
youth, her beauty; she starts using bras, just to deceive people. This
is ugly. There is no need for it; man is intelligent enough to give the
child food in so many ways. But the child should be allowed to play with
the mother’s breasts. If he is not allowed that, then for his whole life
he will think only of breasts and breasts and breasts.</p><p>That is what is happening in the world. Painters go on painting
breasts, sculptors go on sculpting breasts. What is this breast mania?
They have missed playing with their mothers’ breasts, and now it is too
late. And when they come in close contact with a woman of their age, the
woman has breasts hanging – yes, just like Jesus Christ on the cross.
They are no longer attractive, they have lost the beauty, the roundness,
the fullness. They are just a memory, a faded memory.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the pill, the woman is completely free of the fear of
getting pregnant. And because she is capable of multiple orgasms, one
man is not enough to fulfill her desire for love. It is the fault of a
blind biology, I am not responsible for it. And I would like to improve
on blind biological things, because you are now conscious, alert,
intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman needs multiple orgasms, but the jealousy of the man
prevents her. In my commune, we are going to live with understanding and
awareness. If your woman finds that you alone cannot satisfy her, don’t
feel offended. She is simply stating a fact – it is not against you. If
she keeps clinging to you unsatisfied, she is going to take revenge in
every way, because it is you who are preventing her having as much joy
as she is capable of.</p><p>In my commune, nobody should have even the slightest idea that he
possesses the woman, or the woman possesses him. Things are possessed,
not human beings. And if a woman is free, a man is free – to move with
other men, to move with other woman – it is perfectly right, because joy
is right, rejoicing is right. Having the freedom to not be a possession
is right.</p><p>Just the other night, one beautiful girl was taking my interview for
television. And you know I am mad She asked me – now, she was not aware
what kind of man I am; she must have taken</p><p><br></p><p>hundreds of interviews of politicians, priests, and all kind of dodos
– she asked me, “You have loved</p><p>so many women, but don’t you have a stable relationship with one
woman?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is impossible. I don’t have any relationship – stable
or unstable. I live in the moment.” She said, “At this time, who is the
woman?”</p><p>I said, “You are the woman! I love you in this moment.” And in the
end, when I started singing and dancing with my sannyasins, I called her
close to me: “Hold my hand and dance with me.” And it was such a
beautiful situation.</p><p>She told my secretary, “Now my boyfriend is going to freak out!” I
have just said, “I love you,” and was just holding her hand and just
dancing with my people – why should her boyfriend freak out? And if he’s
a freaker, let him freak out. He’s not worthy of being a boyfriend. Drop
that worthless creature! Come to my commune where nobody freaks out,
everybody freaks in.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I WAS REALLY TOUCHED WHEN I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR
ORDINARINESS. AND IN THE SAME MOMENT I REALIZED THAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE
THAT YOU ARE ORDINARY. I SEE SUCH A BIG DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU.
PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not! Who told you I am ordinary?</p><p>I don’t take care about yesterdays. I am an extraordinary person! So
rejoice<span class=s6></span>You are right. I was</p><p>wrong! Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DEATH ENSLAVES US PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY.
IT ALLOWS US THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM FOR SO MANY YEARS AND THEN STEPS IN
TO ASSERT ITS CLAIM ON US AND ON THOSE WE CARE FOR. I FEEL AT THE MERCY
OF AN IMMENSE AND WHIMSICAL PHENOMENON THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF LIFE,
LOVE AND FREEDOM. AND IT FREAKS ME OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>So we have also one who freaks out? This is not allowed! If you enjoy
freaking, why not freak in? Freak as much as you can, but always keep
the direction inwards.</p><p>And the reason you are freaking out is absolutely stupid. You think
death gives you the illusion of life, love, freedom, and then one day
suddenly it comes in and everything is destroyed: life, love, freedom.
Death is not a reality. It cannot step in or step out.</p><p><br></p><p>Death never happens.</p><p><br></p><p>The illusion is not given by death. How can death give the illusion?
In fact, it destroys the illusion. If you are aware that death is bound
to happen, how can you remain in the illusion that life is going to
continue forever? For that you will need really a thick skull. Death is
happening every day. All the cemeteries around the world, and the
crematoriums – death has left its mark.</p><p>Death is not creating the illusion. It is your mind that creates the
illusion that “It is always somebody else who dies, I never die.” And in
a way it looks logical: you always see somebody else dying, you cannot
see yourself dying. The man who has died, he was also in the same
illusion; he had also seen others dying, and deep down he must have been
saying, “It is something that happens to others, it does not happen to
me.”</p><p>This is your mind. Certainly you will never see your death, because
dead men don’t see. Mind gives you the feeling that you are going to
live forever. Drop that illusion, drop that mind! You cannot be certain
even of the next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is good that you cannot be certain of the next moment, and the
tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow; it is good, tremendously good.
Because the next moment is not certain, you are thrown back to the
present. This is the only moment you have got of which you can be
certain – enjoy it! Enjoy it as totally as possible. Squeeze the whole
juice out of it, because who knows? – the next moment may never
come.</p><p>Death is good – it keeps you alert.</p><p><br></p><p>It never gives you a warning of when it is coming; it comes suddenly
out of nowhere. It is a great blessing. Just think: if you were allowed
to be immortal in your body, do you think you would enjoy it? Even
people who live for eighty years start praying for death. They are bored
– the same routine, the same life. What more is there to live for? They
are tired, exhausted, weak, old. Now death is their only hope.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about Alexander the Great, that when he was reaching
India, passing the big desert of Saudi Arabia, he was informed that
there is a well in Saudi Arabia – if you drink out of that well you
become immortal. Naturally, anybody would have been attracted, and
particularly a man like Alexander the Great, who was nothing but a big
ego. He wanted to conquer the whole earth, and he was afraid – is there
time enough or not? The earth is so big He wanted to become the first
man in</p><p>history who has conquered the whole earth.</p><p>This was a good chance; if he is immortal, then there is no problem.
And if somebody is immortal, is not going to die, he is not going to be
sick either, because sickness, illness, disease – they are just steps
towards death. The immortal man will be young, healthy, with no
possibility of any sickness or disease.</p><p>And Alexander was only thirty-three years old; this was a good time
to become immortal. He was healthy, beautiful, strong – this was a good
time to become immortal, that meant he would remain thirty-three
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped his armies and he said, “I am going to the well. Nobody
comes with me.” He did not want anybody else to become immortal. If
others also become immortal, his immortality would no longer be
unique.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to the well – it is a beautiful story. In the East there are
wells made in two ways. One is the ordinary way, a hole in the earth. To
reach water level... you have to pull the water up in a bucket. There is
also another type of well; only very rich people can afford it. On one
side there is an arrangement where you can pull the water up in a
bucket. On the side opposite to it there are steps going to the water
itself. It is really cool there, silent.</p><p>I have been into many wells. When you sit there for hours, time seems
to stop, the whole world seems to be so far away. The noise of the
market, the people – nothing reaches there. Sixty feet deep in the
earth, it is dark, cool, yet very fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>The well where Alexander went was this type of well. So he went in,
step by step, immensely excited. And just as he was making a cup out of
his hands, and filling his hands with the water to drink, a crow who was
sitting just nearby on a tree by the side of the well, said, “Wait! Wait
a minute!”</p><p>Alexander looked back. He could not believe that a crow – because
there was nobody else – could</p><p>speak, but he was speaking. The crow said, “Wait.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “Why did you stop me? Don’t you know I am Alexander
the Great? Nobody can stop me! And you are just a crow.”</p><p>The crow said, “First listen to what I have to say to you, then do
whatsoever you want. I have drunk from this well and I have become
immortal. Now, for hundreds of years I have been trying to commit
suicide – in this way, in that way. Nothing succeeds, and I am tired,
utterly tired. And the very idea that I am going to live forever in this
despair, in this anguish... even death is not going to relieve me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have known everything, I have experienced everything. Now there is
nothing in the future but a painful, miserable existence. That’s why I
said, wait a moment. Now, think it over, and then if you feel like
drinking, drink. But I am sitting here only to prevent people, because I
am suffering so much.”</p><p><br></p><p>A moment of silence... Alexander’s hands dropped the water back into
the well, and he said to the crow, “Thank you, my friend. I am immensely
grateful. I had never thought about it, that I would have to live
forever and forever. My friends will be dying, my beloved will be dying,
my parents will be dying, my teachers will be dying, my contemporaries
will be dying – and I will remain stuck forever. No, I cannot drink this
water, and I pray to you, please remain sitting here, because there are
many fools like me. If they come to know about the well, stop them. It
will be one of the greatest acts of compassion.”</p><p>You say death creates the illusion of life, love? No. It is death
that makes you aware that if you want to live, live now, because
tomorrow is uncertain. If you want to love, love now, because you may be
in the crematorium and sannyasins will be dancing, celebrating.</p><p>Death is a great reminder. If there were no death in the world, it
would have been just hell. Just think: all those people who have died
and are sleeping peacefully in the graveyard, all those people who have
been burned in crematoriums and have been freed completely, have
evaporated into thin air Just think, if all those people – your father,
your father’s father, and so on up to Adam and Eve</p><p>– for millions of years, and nobody is dying.… Poison is useless,
bullets are meaningless, swords cannot cut heads: what will be the
situation? Do you think it will be very pleasant? It will be the worst
that can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Death makes life beautiful, because it makes you alert: don’t miss
the train, don’t miss anything. Enjoy, relish everything possible to
you, because tomorrow is death. Death is not your enemy, death is your
greatest friend. Without death you will be just dead bodies moving
around with no purpose, with no meaning, and no exit.</p><p>If there can be any hell, its name will be “No exit.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre has written a play titled NO EXIT, and it is the
description of hell. The only trouble is there is no way out. And
according to Christianity, you have to be there forever.</p><p>Death is your great friend, companion, which makes you love
intensely, which makes you not want to miss anything. Religions have not
told you the truth. They have been lying to you, telling you that beyond
death there is paradise: all beautiful things, joys, blessings, freely
available. These people are criminals, because they are destroying your
present.</p><p><br></p><p>They are giving you a hope of a better, far more fulfilling life...
after death, so why be bothered about this small time? Why be bothered
about living intensely, totally? Just wait for death to come. Meanwhile
you go on praying in the church, in the mosque, in the synagogue. You go
on listening to all kinds of superstitions and stupidities – they call
them sermons – and go on believing whatever the priest says to you. This
is all that you have to do in life. And don’t commit a sin; otherwise
you may miss paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you look deep into the word “sin,” you will be surprised. It
means no joy, no laughter, no celebration, no love. Anything that makes
you happy is condemned as sin by some religion or other. Remain serious,
with long faces, dull, avoid living. Renounce life, love – renounce the
world and move into some ugly caves in the mountains, and wait there
chanting some mantra– transcendental meditation, or “Ave maria, Ave
maria.”</p><p>These religions have crippled you, destroyed you. They are really
messengers of the devil. All the religions of the world are messengers
of the devil, not of God. There is no God, but about the devil I am
doubtful. Perhaps he exists; otherwise from where do all these
theologians, religious preachers, monks, nuns, Mother Teresa, pope the
Polack – from where do all these people come? Who sent them? There must
be a devil. Or perhaps there is not a devil, but these people are in a
conspiracy against human joy, pleasure, comfort, luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no possibility of a devil. Without God, the devil cannot
exist; he is only the shadow of God. The day I said to you, “There is no
God,” his shadow also disappeared. So it is a committee, not a devil, a
committee of all your prophets, messengers, messiahs – all cheating,
deceiving you, destroying your life in every possible way.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not death that destroys your life and keeps you in illusion. It
is your religions that destroy your life and keep you in an illusion
which will happen after death.</p><p>I say to you, never forget death. It is always there by your side.
Before it grips you, do whatsoever you feel like doing. Dance, have a
little champagne. Love, and don’t be bothered about death, because that
will be destroying your present. When it comes, if we have lived our
life totally and intensely, we will be able to live our death too, with
the same intensity, with the same totality.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, in fact death is only a transmigration – changing your house
which has become dilapidated, is almost in ruins, and moving into a new
house, fresh, just made, made for you. Death is only a change.</p><p>You have changed many houses, many bodies, and you are still here.
Only when you become enlightened, then the work of death is finished,
because after enlightenment you will not be changing the house, you will
not be entering into another body. After enlightenment you will be
entering into absolute freedom, you will be becoming one with the whole
existence. You will be in the flowers, in the birds, in the sun, in the
moon, in the rain, in the wind. You will be all over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>To become enlightened means to live this moment without any
hesitation, without being half-hearted. Put everything at stake. Be a
gambler! Risk everything, because the next moment is not certain. So why
bother? Why be concerned?</p><p>Live dangerously! Live joyously!</p><p>Live without fear, live without guilt; live without any fear of hell
or any greed for heaven. Just live! Death is not creating any illusion
for you, it is your mind. Put this mind aside, so that it cannot disturb
your dance, your song, your music.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>29</span></p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from blind biology</p><p><br></p><p>2 7 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YESTERDAY YOU SPOKE OF SCIENCE AND HOW WE COULD PRODUCE A NEW MAN –
MORE INTELLIGENT, CREATIVE, HEALTHIER AND FREER. IT SOUNDS FASCINATING
AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS SCARY BECAUSE OF THE FEELING OF SOME SORT OF
MASS PRODUCT. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FEAR I AM FEELING?</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely fascinating, and there is no need to feel any fear
about it. In fact, what we have been doing for millions of years is mass
production – accidental mass production.</p><p>Do you know to what kind of a child you are going to give birth to?
Do you know if he will be blind, crippled, retarded, sick, weak,
vulnerable to all kinds of diseases for his whole life? Does your lover
know what he is doing? While you are making love you have no conception,
not even a possibility of guessing.</p><p><br></p><p>You are giving birth to children just like animals, and you don’t
fell scared about it, you don’t feel any fear about it. And you see the
whole world full of retarded people, crippled, blind, deaf, dumb. All
this rubbish! Who is responsible for it? And is it not mass
production?</p><p>My conception of giving scientific birth to a child is that,
conscious, alert, knowingly, we are bringing a visitor to the earth. We
know who he is, what he is and what he is to become finally; how long he
will live, how much intelligence he will have. We are discarding all
possibilities of blind children,</p><p><br></p><p>deaf children, dumb children, retarded in any way – physically,
psychologically – and you are feeling fear? Don’t be stupid.</p><p>The scientific birth of a child is not animalistic. You are
transcending the animal by giving birth to a child scientifically. It is
fascinating, the greatest, most fascinating thing around. We can manage
it, it is already a scientific reality. We can manage healthier people,
who will live as long as we want, and we can give them as much
intelligence as is needed for their work.</p><p><br></p><p>A couple comes to a scientific lab and tells them that they want a
child like Albert Einstein, but better than him, living two hundred
years; and he should never suffer any disease, he should be strong. The
scientific lab finds the right egg from the bank, the right semen from
the bank, and the child is produced in a test-tube with all
precautions.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to adopt the child, you cannot produce the child.
Production of children is animalistic. Adoption of children of your own
imagination Everybody wants a Shakespeare to be born, wants</p><p>their child to be a great poet, a great musician, a great dancer.
Every mother thinks that her child is going to be in some way a
superhuman being, and every mother is frustrated – the child turns out
to be just rotten. He just gets lost in this whole crowd on an
overpopulated planet. This is mass production.</p><p><br></p><p>But adopting a child, you can contemplate on all the qualities that
you need. You can ask the advice of the experts as to what other
qualities will be helpful in his life, how much he will be capable of
love You want a Romeo? – you can get a Romeo. It is only a question of
chemistry. Romeo has</p><p>more male hormones than anybody else – he is richer; that’s why one
woman is not enough for him.</p><p><br></p><p>You want a poet who will transcend all the poets of the past? A
scientist in comparison to whom all the scientists of the past will look
like pygmies? A musician who brings the unknown, the invisible, through
sounds to you? A poet who sings songs of joy and celebration as nobody
else has ever done? You can ask anything, and they have just to work
out, calculate which female egg, which male semen will produce such a
human being.</p><p>That semen is not yours, that egg is not your wife’s; you adopt the
child. In this way you can get what humanity has always dreamed about:
the birth of the superman, a man who is made almost of steel. Your
Muhammad Ali the Great will not be able to face him – just one punch on
his nose and he will be finished. What makes you afraid? Don’t you want
to get above animals? The desire that it will be your semen, that it
will be your wife’s egg, is simply ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Children belong to the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>What speciality has it got that it is your semen? What is the point
of creating a crippled person, just because it is your semen? Science
can manage to raise you above animality – and it is not mass production,
it will be just the opposite. There is not going to be an assembly line
the way cars are produced. It is going to be very individual because
every couple has the choice and the freedom to decide what kind of child
they want.</p><p>How has the idea of mass production come into your mind? Do you think
everybody would like the same kind of child? You are wrong. Do you think
science labs will go on producing children</p><p><br></p><p>according to their own desire, and you have to adopt them? Then it
will be mass production. I am not for it. You are absolutely free to
choose. Right now you are absolutely blind and doing whatsoever you are
doing in utter darkness. You are simply a slave of blind biology.</p><p>Don’t you want freedom from blind biology? Don’t you want to go above
this stupid attachment to the idea that the child is born out of your
semen and your wife’s egg? Those eggs don’t know to whom they belong.
And what is special about your semen? You don’t know anything about it.
You are completely unaware of what kind of people are struggling within
you to be born. You have no choice, you are simply a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying about scientific birth makes you go beyond slavery,
blindness, darkness. It makes you in a certain way more spiritual,
because you are no longer concerned that you semen, your wife’s egg, are
absolutely needed for your child. You give your requirements; you adopt
the child. And you can ask experts what will be the best for the child.
Would you not like your child to be a unique genius?</p><p>For futile attachments, you are satisfied with a crippled child. And
giving birth to a crippled child, a blind child, are you doing any favor
to the child? He will never forgive you! You are responsible. And he
will have to live a life which is not life a all.</p><p><br></p><p>My vision gives total freedom to you, and of course, great
responsibility. Right now you are producing children without any
responsibility.</p><p>You have means available to determine what color the child should be,
what kind of face – Greek, Roman? You can create children who will look
like sculptures, utterly beautiful, with genius in some dimension of
life, living a life of love, intelligent enough to discard all the
priests and all the politicians. They will not become followers of a
leader, they will be enough unto themselves.</p><p>Right now, what are you doing? First you create in blindness,
darkness a child, not knowing what he is going to turn out like. Then
you force him to become a slave by making him a Christian, Hindu,
Mohammedan, or politically giving him a certain ideology – socialism,
fascism, communism. And he is not intelligent enough to rebel against
all these slaveries.</p><p><br></p><p>The child of my vision will be absolute freedom. He will not belong
to any political party, he will not belong to any organized religion. He
will have his own religion, he will have his own political ideology.
What is the need for him to hang around Karl Marx and be a communist? He
can think better than Karl Marx – and Karl Marx is not a great thinker.
He can live so long that he is not in a hurry about anything; patient,
ready to wait – he has time enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of Albert Einstein living three hundred years. He would
have given miracles to the world. But because he wa living in an
accidental body, he had to die.</p><p>We can discard disease, old age. We can program life in every way. We
can even program the life of the child, so that when he wants to die
only then will he die; otherwise he can go on living. If he feels that
there are still juices that he has not tasted, if he feels there are
still dimensions that he has not explored, if he feels that more time is
needed, then he is the master, to decide how long to live.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now, you have lived seventy years on average – that includes
people who live one hundred and fifty years in some places of the world.
In Russia there are people who have passed one hundred and fifty years,
and they are still young. There are people in a certain part of Kashmir,
which Pakistan has invaded, who live very easily to one hundred and
fifty, sixty, seventy. And it is a surprising fact – I have been to
those people – a one hundred and fifty-year-old person is just working
in the field the same way he was working when he was fifty – with the
same strength, with the same gusto.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is needed is better planning, better crossbreeding. It is a
known and applied fact about animals. Do you see the many kinds of
beautiful dogs around the earth? – small, big, powerful, or just
beautiful. Just to see them jump around you is such a joy. Do you think
they came out of blind nature? No, for centuries we have been
crossbreeding dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>You know it as a fact – the whole world accepts it – that a man
should not get married to his own sister. Why? That should be the most
simple thing, to get married to your own sister. You love her already,
you have been together since birth, you know each other. But why have
all cultures prohibited it? All cultures have said that marriage should
be with distant people, people who don’t come from the same family tree,
because the bigger the distance, the better the product.</p><p>If a white American marries a Negro, the child will be far better
than a white American marrying another white American, or a Negro
marrying another Negro, because the distance between those two is
immense – different centuries. They have grown in different atmospheres,
their programming is totally different from each other. So when these
two totally different cultures, traditions, conventions, lifestyles
meet, they give birth to a better man, who has a double heritage: the
heritage of the Negroes and the heritage of the white Americans.</p><p><br></p><p>In a scientific lab it will be possible to find eggs and semen cells
as distant as possible. And we can create through that crossbreeding a
totally new man. There is nothing scary about it. It is not mass
production. The couple has to say what kind of person they would like to
have as their child. It avoids all accidents. And we will be creating
the universal man – not the Chinese, not the Indian, not the English,
but the universal man. So please, just feel fascinated, don’t feel
scared and afraid. There is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen the way children have been produced in the past. For
millions of years you have been doing the same thing – what is the
outcome? The outcome decides the value of what you have been doing. Once
in a while there is an Albert Einstein or a Bertrand Russell – once in a
while!</p><p>This is not right. It should be the ordinary phenomenon, usual. Once
in a while, perhaps there will be a person who is born out of some
unawareness, unalertness on the part of the scientist; otherwise,
everybody should be a genius. Just think: the whole world full of people
like Rabindranath, Jean- Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger!</p><p>And we can prevent people like Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin
from being born, because they have been calamities here. We can close
the door completely on all Genghis Khans, Tamerlanes, Nadir Shahs – all
those ugly monsters whose whole life consisted of killing people,
destroying people, burning people.</p><p>The way we have lived has not proved right. We have only a crowd of
pygmies all around – this is what you should be scared of! But having a
garden of geniuses, creative people, a garden from</p><p><br></p><p>where we have removed all fanatics, idiots, politicians – in short,
we have taken out all that was poisonous, all pollution.…</p><p>There is so much in the idea. Now, how many people are suffering
because they have a snubbed nose? Their whole life they feel inferior.
How many people are suffering because they have only nose? If you look
at them, everything else is so small and the nose is so big.…</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard... one millionaire had a very big nose and very small
eyes, but he was the richest man in the community. People used to laugh
behind him, but nobody ever dared He was invited by a</p><p>family for dinner. The family was concerned about only one thing:
their child, who was a born philosopher, asked about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>From the morning they were teaching him, “You can ask anything, but
when the rich man comes, you are not to ask about his nose.” They told
him so many times that he became immensely interested, “What is so great
about the nose?” They had never prevented him from asking any question.
Why was this nose so important?</p><p><br></p><p>And he was really excited, eagerly waiting for the millionaire to
come. When he came in, the child laughed. He said to his parents, “He
has only nose, nothing else! And why were you preventing me<span class=s6></span>? He is a rare specimen!” He destroyed the whole
effort.</p><p>But people... almost everyone is suffering from something or other.
Somebody is suffering from his color, somebody is suffering from his
tallness; somebody is too tall, somebody is too small. What have you
produced? This is mass production – accidental, produced in darkness. At
least human beings – who are the crown in existence – should not suffer
anymore from an inferiority complex. The only way is scientific
production of children. And there are immense possibilities in it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if the child is produced in a scientific lab, they can
produce a similar child simultaneously. The other child will be kept in
the lab growing simultaneously; exactly as the one who has gone out to
be adopted by a family, the other will be growing in the scientific lab.
Just the existence of the other gives great opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you get a fractured leg. Now no need to bother to fix
the fracture – the leg from the other fellow can be taken and given to
you. Something goes wrong, berserk, in your head – now there is no need
for all the psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists. Your head is
just removed, you get a fresh head.</p><p><br></p><p>The other person will remain in anesthesia his whole life, in a deep
freeze. He will not know anything of what is happening. He is just there
in case something goes wrong with you – and many things go wrong in
life, even with every precaution. Something can always go wrong; life is
a long affair. You may have a car accident now, that cannot be prevented
by scientific reproduction of children.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, those children will not believe in the fifty-five miles per
hour limit; that will be sheer stupidity. The people who are going to
live three hundred years will change everything around. Rather than
keeping to fifty-five miles per hour for millions of people, why not
create better and straighter roads where you can move at two hundred
miles per hour?</p><p><br></p><p>Your roads are just ugly, so many turns – their roads will be totally
different. In fact, in Japan one scientist has proved that if a car
moves at four hundred miles per hour – and a car can – at four hundred
miles per hour the cars, just because of that great speed, rise one foot
above the road. No bumps, no troubles from the road. There may be snow,
and there may be ice; let it be there – you will be simply going one
foot above.</p><p>In fact, that possibility makes it a great opportunity. If you can
move four hundred miles per hour one foot above the road, the road is
not really needed! You need only launching roads. The moment you pick up
speed, then you can go anywhere; roads or no roads make no
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>But all depends on whether we have courage enough to rise over our
fearful selves. We have to rise above the scary feeling. Be fascinated
with the New Man!</p><p><br></p><p>The New Man must have a new kind of birth. The New Man must have a
new kind of life, a new kind of love, a new kind of death. He will be
new in every possible way. He will replace the old models who are
overcrowding the earth – junkyards. They are not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a simple process of programming the first cell. And only the
first cell can be programmed, because then it goes on reproducing itself
– that is an autonomous process. You can program it for everything.
Right now it is difficult; it is programmed for all kinds of diseases,
it is programmed for death, old age. You can’t have any control over it.
There is no way to change the program now, because all the cells have
the same program.</p><p>If they are programmed for a particular disease that you get by
inheritance, you will suffer from that disease. It could have been
changed, but only in the first meeting of the male and the female cells.
Everything can be programmed, and an exact copy of you can be kept in
the lab. If your heart is not functioning well, the new heart is
available – which will fit you exactly, because it comes from your copy,
your twin.</p><p><br></p><p>Any new thing scares, but it scares only cowards. Any new thing
fascinates, but it fascinates only the brave ones. Be brave, because we
nee a new, brave world.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SPOKE OF TRANSPLANTING THE BRAIN OF GENIUSES LIKE EINSTEIN INTO
THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN. BUT IF EINSTEIN WANTED TO BE A PLUMBER INSTEAD
OF A SCIENTIST, AND WE TRANSPLANTED HIS BRAIN, HAVE WE NOT DONE
SOMETHING AGAINST HIS WISHES? HE COULD BE STUCK ON EARTH FOR ANOTHER
SEVENTY YEARS, POSSIBLY AGAINST HIS CHOICE. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>It is so simple that I wonder, cannot you figure out small things
yourself? The brain is a mechanism, it is not Einstein’s soul. The brain
is just a computer. We will transplant Einstein’s brain; that does not
make any difference to the journey of his soul. His soul will go on
moving, and if he wants to be a plumber and really desires to be a
plumber, he may become a plumber.</p><p><br></p><p>But this brain he has developed, which is unique You may not be aware
that he himself donated</p><p>his brain to Harvard University: “When I die, my brain should be
studied as carefully as possible to find what the difference is between
my brain and other people’s brain.” And there is a great distance. He
himself was curious. He said, “Of course, I will not be able to know,
because I will be dead, but it may help you, humanity, to know what the
difference is.”</p><p>After four years of research the difference has been found. It is
very small. That small difference can be introduced into any brain and
it will start functioning on a far higher level. But you will be again
scared that science introduced something into your brain. It is just a
little difference, but it makes a great difference: Einstein had
proportionately more of certain cells than any other brain. Now, those
cells can be cultivated and introduced into any brain.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody is interested. The research is finished, the findings are
at hand. Nobody is interested, because the whole world is interested in
how to destroy each other. They are so much occupied with war, day in
and day out, that many beautiful things that go on happening in
scientific research are just lying by the side. Nobody is using
them.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be afraid that Einstein will be stuck for seventy years
against his will, no. Einstein is a totally different phenomenon than
the brain. The brain is just a thing attached to the soul of Einstein.
The same brain can be attached to another soul. It will function the
same, because it is an attachment; it has nothing to do with the soul.
The soul will only supply the energy for the brain to function. If an
idiot’s brain is attached to you, your soul will supply energy to the
idiot’s brain; you will function like an idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>And you know small things change your behavior. You drink alcohol –
although it is called spirits, it is not a spirit. Your spirit is
absolutely unaffected by the alcohol. Alcohol goes into your brain, into
your body, and creates all kinds of disturbances – pleasant, unpleasant.
There are other drugs, such as LSD, which can change your whole mind at
least for a few hours or a few days.</p><p>When Aldous Huxley for the first time – he was a pioneer in that
sense – took LSD, he could not believe it: everything looked more
beautiful, luminous. Even the chair in front of him was radiant, had an
aura of light around it. What had happened?</p><p>The LSD had tricked his mind, influenced his mind. He saw the beauty
of the flowers – those flowers he had seen before, but not the way they
were appearing today. The fragrance was overpowering. His soul was the
same, but the attached brain now had LSD in it, and was magnifying
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Aldous Huxley was a beautiful man of immense intelligence; hence,
through LSD he saw only paradise. He started experimenting with other
people. Then he became aware that it is not LSD that creates paradise;
for some people it creates hell. It depends on the person’s mind – LSD
only magnifies, multiplies. If you are a miserable person, LSD will make
you a million times more miserable. If you are a man of joy, LSD will
magnify your joy a thousand times.</p><p>He became aware that it is not LSD that creates paradise. LSD does
not create anything, it is simply a magnifying glass. So the same flower
looks more beautiful, a thousand times more beautiful; the same
fragrance is now so dense and overpowering. But a man who is miserable,
a man who is continuously down in the dumps, will find himself in the
darkest hole ever. That’s why Aldous Huxley wrote a book and named it
HEAVEN AND HELL. It is a book about LSD.</p><p><br></p><p>Your soul remains unaffected. When LSD has run out of your physical
system, you are back home, the same miserable person you have been
before, or the same joyous person you have been before. But the
experience of two or three days under LSD changes many of your
ideas.</p><p>Aldous Huxley himself was so much impressed that he thought all the
mystics who have experienced heaven must have been creating something
like LSD by their exercises, prayer, meditation and other methods.
That’s not true. He was so much impressed that he thought this is the
ultimate panacea. But soon he became aware that it not true, because a
few people go into hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Your brain is a separate thing from your soul, so don’t be worried
about Einstein. His brain is already in the Harvard University, resting
in alcohol. Do you think Albert Einstein is caged there in that bottle?
Albert Einstein must be a plumber somewhere – perhaps here, because
where else can he find a place where plumbers are as much respected as
professors? where plumbers are not lower than presidents? This is the
only place where nobody is higher or lower. Everybody is doing something
essential, something which is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a phenomenon that has happened in India. Jainism is
the oldest religion in India. In one of the conferences of the Jainas, I
challenged them. I told them, “If you are really a religion, you should
create a commune consisting only of Jainas. And then you will know that
you don’t have a complete philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is going to make the shoes? Jainas cannot do it. Who is going to
be a plumber? Jainas cannot</p><p>do that. Who is going to clean the toilets? Jainas cannot do it. Then
what kind of religion is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I told them – and made many enemies. That has been my life’s work. I
am going to write a book like Dale Carnegie: “How to Influence People
and Make Enemies.” I told them, “You are parasites. You are living
amongst Hindus, exploiting Hindus; you are parasites. Why should anybody
else clean your toilets?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the first commune in the whole world which is not in any way
parasitical. Here everybody is doing everything. In fact, there is so
much movement – professors become plumbers. One day you see the
professor teaching in the university and another day you find him
plumbing. And you are surprised – what has happened? He says, “I got
bored teaching, teaching, teaching. I am on holiday from teaching, and
plumbing is beautiful.”</p><p>In this commune we make holidays by changing your job, we don’t have
any other holidays. But changing the job, scientifically, is a holiday,
because when you are functioning as a professor, a certain part of your
brain functions – only a certain part, not the whole brain. When you are
a plumber, another part of your brain functions; the professor is on
holiday. This way we don’t lose time, we don’t lose days, and still we
enjoy holidays as much as we want!</p><p>Don’t be afraid about Einstein. Just remember, your body is not
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU TALKABOUT CHRISTIANITY, YOU USUALLYTALKABOUT CATHOLICISM.
PLEASE, WILL YOU SPEAK ABOUT PROTESTANT CHURCHES? WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE
THE POPE.</p><p>I certainly have avoided speaking on Protestantism, for the simple
reason that the man who created it, Martin Luther, is not worth
considering at all. Jesus Christ may be crazy, nuts, but Martin Luther
was just a politician.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no difference between the Catholic’s basic doctrine and the
Protestant’s. Why did he create so much fuss and divide Christianity
into two parts? – because he himself wanted to become the pope. Finding
it difficult... and remember, he was a German, and Germans have
something in them that drives them to become Adolf Hitlers; they want to
be always on the top.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day one Germany journalist was asking me, “Why don’t
you use Mercedes-Benz?”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked, “Why should I use Mercedes-Benz? I have tried all the models
of Mercedes-Benz, I have the</p><p>latest Mercedes 500, but they don’t come even close to a Rolls
Royce.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This will make Germans feel very bad. The Mercedes-Benz has
to be the topmost car.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why? It is a good car; my secretary uses it. But the Rolls Royce is
simply unique, no other car comes close to it. But to the Germans, it
hurts. Strange, what kind of psychology is there?</p><p>It very much hurt Martin Luther that he was just a bishop. And no
German has ever been chosen as a pope. Perhaps they were afraid that
once a German becomes the pope, no one knows what he will do He tried
hard in the beginning to be chosen a pope.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good thing about popes, that by the time a person becomes a
pope he is almost on his deathbed. Only this Polack who is now the pope
has deceived – Polacks are Polacks. Perhaps he has forgotten to die!
Otherwise, popes have been dying after one year, two years, three years
at the most. So it gave chances to other people.</p><p><br></p><p>Martin Luther tried many times, but he was never chosen. Then he
rebelled. That’s why his religion is called Protestantism. It is a
protest – the protest of a politician, the protest of a German, the
protest of a man who wanted to be on the top but could not be.</p><p>But there is no difference of any significance in their theologies.
They both believe in Jesus Christ, they both believe in the virgin birth
of Jesus Christ, and they both believe in his resurrection after the
crucifixion. The only difference is that Catholics also worship Jesus’
mother, Mary.</p><p><br></p><p>For this much difference, why should I bother about these people? I
am hitting at the very roots. These small matters don’t matter. So when
I am speaking against Christianity, remember, I am not speaking only
against Catholicism. I am speaking against all the sects and cults – and
there are many. I am speaking against Christianity as a whole.</p><p>Martin Luther was against the pope because he could not become the
pope. You can see he was not really against the pope; he himself wanted
to be the pope. It was just the old story of Aesop.…</p><p><br></p><p>A fox was trying to catch hold of beautiful grapes, ripe, inviting.
But her jump was not enough to catch hold of the grapes. She tried many
times. She was not aware that a small rabbit was watching, hiding in a
bush. The moment she saw the rabbit, she walked away with dignity. The
rabbit said, “Auntie, what is the matter?” The fox said, “The grapes are
not ripe.”</p><p>That’s what Martin Luther said, “The grapes are sour.” If he was
really against the pope, then why did he want to become the pope?</p><p><br></p><p>I will not accept – even if all the Christians of the world ask me to
become the pope, I will not accept it. I will not accept even if the
whole world asks me to become God, the creator, the father who is... (A
noise is heard on the roof of Rajneesh Mandir)... above the roof of
Rajneesh Mandir. Those are just two electricians! I will not accept it.
Anything that is wrong, howsoever powerful it makes you, I am not going
to accept. I am fulfilled, and I am absolutely contented with myself. I
have no protest, no complaint, no grudge against anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this simple reason that I have not talked about the
Protestant section of Christianity separately. There is nothing separate
about it. It is just the German mind that makes it separate and I am not
in favor of this kind of German mind.</p><p>I have more sannyasins in Germany than anywhere else, for the simple
reason that they have seen the ugliness of Adolf Hitler and what he did.
The younger generation does not want to carry that German mind any more,
and this is the only place where we can deprogram them.</p><p><br></p><p>We have one dozen communes in Germany. It takes a little hard work to
break down the German mind, but it is worth trying, because once it
breaks down the breakthrough is not far away. And once a German drops
the German mind – it takes longer for him to drop his mind, but once he
drops it, he drops it forever.</p><p>Those people have guts. I love them. Sooner or later the whole of
Germany is going to be red. We cannot leave Germany, for the simple
reason that they are the strongest people in the world. If they can
alone fight the whole world, and go on winning for five years under the
leadership of a crackpot, these people are of immense value. If we can
change Germany, we can change the whole world. That is the criterion:
Germany in our hands, the whole world is in our hands, because nobody
can have as much resistance as the Germans.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been experimenting, and I have been successful. Once a German
has fallen in love with me, it is forever. You ask Haridas. He came to
me somewhere around fifteen years ago; since then he has not left for a
single moment. His old mother wanted to see him – she had to come, he
would not go. He will not leave me for a single moment. And when his
mother saw the flowering of her son, the transformation, she did not
wait; she immediately became a sannyasin. I have given her the name
Haridasi. She is old, but a beautiful woman, very loving.</p><p><br></p><p>Martin Luther was the same type as Adolf Hitler. He created this
schism in Christianity, but he has not contributed anything to the world
– that’s why I don’t criticize him. I simply ignore the fellow. He is
just below me.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAY THAT WE, YOUR DISCIPLES, ARE NOT FOLLOWERS BUT FELLOW
TRAVELERS. IT IS TRUE THAT WE ARE WANDERING AND SEEKING, BUT YOUR
TRAVELINGS CAME TO AN END LONG AGO. YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO, NOTHING TO
ACHIEVE; YOU ARE UTTERLY <span class=s10>FULFILLED. SO</span> WHY
DON’T YOU ACCEPT YOUR RIGHT POSITION OF BEING OUR GUIDE? WHY CONFUSE AND
CONFOUND YOUR DONKEYS AND CAMELS?</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to confuse and confound all the Yankees, all the monkeys,
all the donkeys, all the camels –</p><p>because there is no other way to make them lions, and finally to
create the child.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is true that I have nowhere to go. I have got it, that which
you are seeking and searching for. But still I will not accept the idea
of being your leader, guide, because those words have very wrong
connotations with them. The religious leaders and guides have exploited
the whole humanity so much that I don’t want to be associated with them
in any way – and those words make me associated with them.</p><p>I am utterly contented, there is nothing more; but I go on walking,
moving, just to destroy the idea that I am the leader and you are the
follower. You are seeking; I have found it, but can’t I play and seek
with you just to help you feel that you are not followers but fellow
travelers?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not want to insult you by calling you followers. I respect you.
A small device I had to maintain: that is, just to go on seeking and
searching with you, knowing perfectly well that there is nothing for me
to seek. And there is nothing for you to seek either. It is just that I
know it and you don’t know it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just being your fellow traveler, I will infect you. I am contagious!
Sooner or later you will realize my play, and you will be grateful,
remember. You will be grateful that I never became your leader, never
reduced you to be the led, never gave you any guidance – that is
humiliating.</p><p>But just being with you – and I know you have got it, just the way I
have got it – in some proper moment I will shake you and wake you
up.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not guidance.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just shaking and waking.</p><p><br></p><p>Guidance is needed for a goal somewhere far away – what path to
follow. I want you to remember that it is not only you who respect me, I
also respect you.</p><p>Buddha could not say that, Mohammed could not say that, Jesus could
not say that. And I feel there is some weakness in these fellows.
Somehow they are feeling a gratification from being the leader, the
guide, the prophet, the messiah, the savior. Something of the ego is
there – very subtle, sophisticated, refined, slippery, you cannot catch
hold of it, but it is there in their declaration of being higher than
you, better than you. They have arrived and you are miles away, with
miles to travel, arduous miles.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha and Mahavira say, “Where we are, you will take lives to
reach.” They are creating such a big</p><p>distance between you and themselves. That’s the way of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying in every possible way to close any gap between me and
you, knowing perfectly well that there is a little difference:</p><p>I am awake, you are asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Playing with you, singing and dancing with you, I am certain I will
make you awake without being your leader, without being your guide.
Don’t be worried, I am not renouncing you. When I say that I am not your
leader, don’t think that I am abandoning you. Don’t think that if you
are not my followers, then what the hell are you doing here? I take life
very nonseriously. It is really a great joke!</p><p><br></p><p>I know more jokes than anybody in the whole world, and I can say with
absolute certainty that there is no joke which is bigger than life
itself. What a joke – that you are it, and you are seeking it! You are
where you are meant to be, and you are running all around, searching for
the right place. Not only that, you are suggesting to me that I should
take my right position as the guide. I am in my right position – not as
the guide, but just as a playmate. Can’t you accept it?</p><p>That means your ego comes in between. Your ego wants me to be the
master of masters, the greatest master in the whole history of the
world, because only then can you say, “I am the follower of the greatest
master in history; certainly I am one of the greatest followers in the
whole history.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to help you in strengthening your ego. I am perfectly
aware what hurts you. You would like me to fulfill the image and all
kinds of expectations so that you can feel, “This is the right guide,
and I am the person who has found the right guide. All other leaders are
pygmies, and their followers, of course, are even worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>No, I am not going to help you in that way. I will play the role of
being a very ordinary man. I know, and you know, that I am not an
ordinary man, but what to do! I don’t guide you, I help you. You don’t
need guidance, you need just a little help, a hit... just a little cold
water thrown against your eyes so that you wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be grateful one day that I never accepted the idea of the
leader and the led, because once you accept the idea of the leader you
free the led from all responsibility. Once you accept that the savior is
here, it means you have nothing to do; you have just to be faithful,
believing. And I am destroying all your beliefs and all your faiths –
how can I be the leader? The leader needs believers.</p><p><br></p><p>I am something utterly different from the people you have known
before: Jesus, Moses, Mahavir, Krishna, Buddha. I am not part of their
company.</p><p>With me begins a new era in enlightenment, where the master will be
just playing games with you, where the master will not allow you to be
behind him, but drag you by his side. I can put you ahead of me, but I
cannot put you behind. It is a subtle device.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t feel depressed, I am not abandoning you. I am your master,
you are my follower. But don’t tell it to anybody, keep it a secret!</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>DO ONLY COWARDS DROP SANNYAS?</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody ever drops sannyas. Yes, once in a while a coward takes
sannyas. And I am just incapable of refusing, so even if a coward comes
to take sannyas... I know perfectly well he will not be a sannyasin. He
will wear the robe, he will make every effort, but sooner or later he
will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>I say nobody drops sannyas except those people who have never been
sannyasins; they only looked as if they were sannyasins. I allow them to
have the opportunity, because sometimes it happens that a person who
takes sannyas without any understanding of what it is – perhaps already
thinking, “Let us try it. There is nothing binding; when I go home, I
will go home in the same dress as I had come, I will leave all these red
clothes behind” – even such a person has the potential. So I don’t
refuse anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>It is unpredictable. The man becomes a sannyasin, already thinking
that this is just to take part in the commune – it looks embarrassing
not to be a sannyasin here, it is the “in” thing, so just as a fashion
he enters. But he does not know that you cannot trick me. I allow him,
and start playing the game with him. Ninety percent of these people turn
out to be sannyasins. Ten percent, who were only pretending to be
sannyasins, drop out.</p><p>That’s why I say, no sannyasin drops sannyas. Only those who were not
really sannyasins drop it. But what have they to drop? They were never
sannyasins in the first place.</p><p>To have a taste of sannyas, to have a taste of me, to drink the wine
I am making available to you, to laugh and to sing and to dance – then
it is impossible that anybody can drop sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a few idiots will be there who will dance only because everybody
else is dancing; it looks awkward not to dance. They will be in red
clothes because everybody is in red clothes and they don’t want to look
like outsiders. Those few idiots will come and go. But my compassion for
idiots is as much as for any genius – in fact, a little more. I try my
hardest so that the idiot drops his camelhood, becomes a lion. And I
have succeeded with many idiots, I have seen them transforming into
lions. And a few idiots even have reached to the stage of the child.</p><p>So my sannyas is available for everybody – with no qualifications,
with no conditions. I don’t demand</p><p>that you have to follow a certain discipline, then only can you
become a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I said this and a few camels went to the office. They said,
“Osho says no qualifications, no conditions. We want to become
sannyasins, but we will not wear the red clothes and we will not wear
the mala.” These camels don’t understand that red clothes and mala are
not qualifications, they are not conditions. They are your
identification card – spread all over your body, so no need to pull it
out of your pocket and show people. You will be seen anywhere from miles
away.</p><p>The red color is really the color of danger. It is your
identification card; it is not your quality, it is not your
qualification, it has nothing to do with your discipline.</p><p>So remember, no camel should go to the office and ask for sannyas
Then why are you asking for</p><p>sannyas? Just believe you are sannyasins – because you will not be
wearing the mala, you will not be wearing the red clothes. So what is
the trouble? Why even ask for sannyas? Imagine, believe that you are a
sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you ask to become a sannyasin you will have to carry the
identification card around the world, because this is how I have
approached millions of people. Just think, if I had not given a
particular uniform to you, you would have been lost in the world. I
would not even be able to recognize you, you would not feel any
connection with me. You would not even be able to drop sannyas, and your
sannyas would not create any troubles for you in life. And I want those
troubles in your life, in your work, in your job.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be constantly in a state of challenge, surrounded by
hostile forces, because this is the only way a real sannyasin grows –
out of fire, burning all around.</p><p>My sannyasins have been thrown out of their jobs, they have been
thrown out of the universities where they were teaching, where they were
professors. They are fighting in the courts. When you fight for your
sannyas you have some respect for it, some love for it; you have some
connection with me. When you are in trouble and you have to suffer many
things, and you are ready to suffer but not to drop sannyas, that makes
you stronger. It brings your capacities to their peak. You are ready to
die, but you are not going to compromise.</p><p><br></p><p>Against me and the sannyasins, in Oregon, they have a slogan written
on the trucks, buses –</p><p>anywhere they can find a place. The slogan is: It is better to be
dead than red.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to remember: It is certainly better to be dead than
not to be red!</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s14>30</span></p><p><br></p><p>Everybody wants freedom, nobody wants responsibility</p><p><br></p><p>28 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEVER OUR RELATIONSHIPS
WITH ALL</p><p>“ISMS.” DOES THIS INCLUDE RAJNEESHISM AS WELL?</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly. But you don’t understand one thing – Rajneeshism is not an
“ism.” It is just because of the poverty of language that we had to call
it Rajneeshism. It is not an “ism” because it has no theology, no
ideology, no philosophy – which are basic needs for an “ism” to
exist.</p><p><br></p><p>You are absolutely free individuals. You don’t belong to a certain
concept about existence, about God, heaven and hell. You simply don’t
have any conceptualization.</p><p>We are existential: the “ism” is a mind thing. Our approach to
reality is not a mind approach, it is a communion of heart to heart. All
“isms” have belief systems: we don’t have any belief system. You are not
required to believe in anything unless you know it; and when you know
something you don’t believe, there is no need. You believe only things
which you don’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>Belief grows only in ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing something is enough, there is no need to believe. We are
seekers, searchers, not believers.</p><p>We don’t have any idea beforehand about what we are going to get in
the end, when the search</p><p><br></p><p>is over. Hence, I say to you, it is just poverty of language that our
approach to reality is called Rajneeshism.</p><p>But it is not an “ism” at all, because it does not fulfill the
requirements to make it an “ism.” Communism is, socialism is, fascism
is; all religions are. They are not existential. They are not trying to
discover individually, in a very intimate and personal way, what this
life is all about. They have taken for granted words of others – and
words are just words, containers without any content.</p><p><br></p><p>Words have a strange quality. You can go on and on building big
palaces, castles in the air, through words, but there is no base to your
castle in the air. The base is provided by your own experiencing. You
can become a Christian just by believing in THE BIBLE. You can become a
Hindu just by believing in the VEDAS.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot become a Rajneeshee by believing in my words. You become a
Rajneeshee when you also start feeling the same song I am feeling, you
start the dance that is happening within me, you become full of the
fragrance It is not wordy, it is existential.</p><p><br></p><p>To call it Rajneeshism was just a necessity enforced by poor language
– it has no word for the existential approach. Even the philosophy of
existence is called existentialism – the same stupid idea. Those
philosophers are saying that there is no way to find the truth through
argument, intellect.</p><p>Existence is available if you are silent, listening to it.… The sound
of the running water, the wind blowing through the pine trees, the smell
of a rose; the beauty of some face; the ecstasy of dropping all ideas,
becoming a child – innocent, enchanted by everything life is made of. He
knows nothing about it, but he feels it.</p><p><br></p><p>A just-born baby.… You bring the rose close to him, he will see it,
he will certainly find fragrance. But he cannot have in his being,
anywhere, words. He cannot say to himself, “What a beautiful red rose.”
He does not know that beautifulness has a name, that there are words
which call this a flower, a rose.</p><p><br></p><p>He knows nothing about colors, he cannot say it is red, but he finds
it redder than you find it. He finds it livelier than you find it. He
discovers immense beauty, fragrance, fragileness – but he has no words.
He does not say anything within himself, he is utterly silent, absorbing
all that the roseflower can give to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Rajneeshism is basically a transformation of you to the child
again.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “ism” is not really applicable, but what to do? Language is
a kind of imprisonment. Some word has to be used and all words will be
wrong. So I said, “Okay, call it Rajneeshism. But as far as the ‘ism’
idea is concerned, include Rajneeshism completely out of any other ‘ism’
that has existed before.”</p><p><br></p><p>It would be easier to call it something totally new, but then nobody
would understand what it is. So until we have enough people to
understand, we will have to carry a wrong label on it. Once they have
understood, the label will be removed. Once we have our own world around
this earth, “ism” is not going to be part of our way of life. So if you
think Rajneeshism is also an “ism,” throw it away. You</p><p><br></p><p>have not understood anything. Your approach is still intellectual;
otherwise, such a question would not have arisen.</p><p>You can see – no dogma is preached, no belief system is given. You
are not required to accept anything. The atheist can become part of my
communes, the theist can become part, the communist can become part, the
capitalist can become part. We don’t discriminate against anybody. Our
basic approach is such, that whosoever becomes part of us, we deprogram.
And the process of deprogramming is the same; whether you deprogram a
Communist or a Catholic or a Protestant does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like surgery. If a communist has cancer, goes through
surgery, do you think the surgery will be different than the surgery
when a Catholic has cancer? Will there be a Catholic surgery? Hindu
surgery? Mohammedan surgery? You can understand perfectly well that
surgery doesn’t take any account of who you are, but it knows how to
remove the cancer. And I am continuously hammering on your cancer to
destroy it.</p><p>All “isms” are nothing but spiritual cancer; and if you think of
Rajneeshism also in the same intellectual terms, I am going to hammer on
it too. But it is not an “ism,” it is not a cancer: it is a surgical
method. We just had to give it a wrong name, because no right name
exists in any language.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, the day will come when we will start creating new words, new
languages. It is certainly foolish that in this world there are
thousands of languages – all that it needs is one language. And these
languages have grown haphazardly, unscientifically, but we go on
carrying them – just junk, thousands of years old.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I say one world is needed and one world government is needed,
so one scientifically created language is needed, so that all men,
wherever they are, are capable of understanding each other.</p><p><br></p><p>No old language should be accepted as the world language, for the
simple reason that old languages are not capable of coping with the new
reality that goes on changing. And the second reason: if you choose one
language out of the old, all other languages which are not chosen will
fight against it, naturally. If you just think of numbers, then Chinese
will be the world language, because of every four people, one is a
Chinese. And Chinese is the most difficult language, the most
unscientific, because it is one of the most ancient languages.</p><p>It has no alphabet, it has only symbols. Just to be able to
understand Chinese you have to understand at least ten thousand symbols
– just to begin with! If you want to be a real scholar in the language,
then one hundred thousand symbols you have to remember. It is an
unnecessary burden, absolutely not needed. And even those symbols are
not clear.</p><p>If in Chinese you want to write “war, conflict, struggle, fight,” you
have only one symbol – very true. The symbol is one tree and two women
under it. That is, one husband and two women under one roof: the tree is
the roof. But is is up to you whether to understand it as war, as fight,
as struggle, as battle, or just a conflict, a debate, a discussion –
because the symbol can represent all these things. You have to learn the
context in which the symbol is used.</p><p><br></p><p>To learn Chinese, if you are not born Chinese, takes at least thirty
years. As far as numbers are concerned, Chinese is the first language,
and they will not be ready to give chances to any language which is far
behind them.</p><p>No old language will do. But man is capable of creating a language
like Esperanto and making it absolutely scientific so that no confusion
arises. And because it will be a new language, there is nobody who will
be privileged because it is his mother tongue. And nobody else will be
disadvantaged because he has to learn a language for thirty years –
almost half his life.</p><p><br></p><p>A new language will be equally acceptable to all. It will not be a
competitor to any language. And only a new language can manage to be
scientific; old languages cannot. Old languages go on adjusting to the
new realities, but their adjustments make them silly. For example,
horses are no longer important, but horsepower... strange, a car has so
much horsepower, an aeroplane has so much horsepower. This is
adjustment. Horses are gone, but horsepower will continue.</p><p><br></p><p>In English you have a word “daughter.” You may not be aware that it
is very ancient. It comes from the Sanskrit, duhita. Five or ten
thousand years ago, it was the privilege of the daughter to milk the
cow. duhita means one who milks the cow. Now from duhita has arisen the
word “daughter,” because only daughters were doing that job ten thousand
years ago in India. The reason is that the cow is holy to the Hindus,
and they would like it to be milked only by a virgin girl, to keep the
milk holy. But what has it to do with daughter? There may be millions of
daughters who have never touched a single cow, and they are still being
called daughter.</p><p>If you look into the history of any word, you will make amazing
discoveries. How has it arisen? Centuries have changed the word’s color,
its tone, its pronunciation – everything. New qualities have been given
to it which are not applicable. Words are dead things, and it is time
that we have one language, scientifically arranged.</p><p>When the first American woman met me, it was nearly thirty years ago.
She was interested in me – I</p><p>was traveling, and she asked, “What is your schedule?”</p><p>I said, “Forgive me, I don’t understand this word – skedual? What is
a skedual?</p><p><br></p><p>She was puzzled. She said, “This is a simple word, a common
word.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You just explain it to me, perhaps I may be able to figure
out what you mean.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then I found out – because in India, English is spoken with the
British pronunciation, not the American. Certainly the American
pronunciation of the word is more accurate because of the spelling of
the word. The British pronunciation is “shed-dule,” not “skedual” – they
are the same words. I was accustomed to hearing ““shed-dule.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to her, “Forgive me, but there was no way to figure out that
it is ‘shed-dule’ that you are using.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is so much misunderstanding in the world, and one of the
greatest reasons is that we have so many languages. It is a tower of
Babel. You cannot understand what the communist is saying, because he
has his own connotations of the word, his own meaning. The communist
cannot understand what you are saying, he has different connotations of
the same word.</p><p><br></p><p>Communists believe they have the real democracy, because how can a
democracy exist where the society is divided into classes? – the poor
and the rich and the middlers. If the society is divided and the gap is
so big between the rich and the poor, the rich are going to dominate; so
don’t call it democracy, it is aristocracy. No communist is ready to
believe that in America there is democracy, because the first basic
thing is not to write in the constitution that “all men are equal,” but
to make them equal; then democracy is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>If there are so many poor people, their votes can be purchased. They
are being purchased, because for the poor man democracy cannot give
bread and butter. The word “democracy” is for those who have everything,
it is not for him. If he can get something tangible just for giving a
vote, he is ready.</p><p>I have seen it in India – India is a democracy, but not a single poor
man becomes the prime minister, the governor, the chief minister. It is
impossible for the poor man to reach there, because the expenses of
election are so big. Yet in the constitution everybody has equal rights,
and every vote has equal value. Communists cannot accept the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>America cannot accept Russia as a democracy, because only one party
exists. There is no choice – how can you apply freedom? You have to
choose the communists, there is nobody else. You have to choose the
communists unanimously. What kind of democracy is this? Democracy
according to the American mind needs two parties at least.</p><p><br></p><p>Russians go on declaring themselves the most democratic. Americans go
on declaring they are the greatest democracy. Now, that word “democracy”
is not scientific. It has different meanings to different people.</p><p><br></p><p>You know the English word “go.” You cannot imagine, howsoever wild a
dreamer you are, from where this word “go” comes. It comes again from
the cow.</p><p>In Sanskrit, the cow is called cav. And the Hindus have been
interested in the cow so much, they love the cow so much, they have
called the cow their mother. And in fact, ten thousand years ago, when
the hunting society was changing into an agricultural society, the cow
became of immense importance. She was giving food, she was giving bulls
to be used for bullock carts, to be used in farming. Everything that the
cow gives is usable – even cow dung, because it is a very powerful
fertilizer.</p><p><br></p><p>So they used to worship the cow. And it was a common thing that in
the morning the cows would go to the grasslands, and in the evening at
the time of sunset they would come back home. And the Hindus started
saying, “The cow is going to the forest, the cow is going home.” Going
became associated with the cow.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word “go” or “going” has come from ten thousand-year-old
Hindus, and it is associated with the cow, not with you. When you say,
“I am going,” you are saying, “I am a cow”! And that’s what
Sanskrit-speaking people will understand. And they will be amazed: “What
are you saying?”</p><p><br></p><p>All the languages of the world create walls, very subtle transparent
walls, which are far more difficult to remove than the wall that exists
in Berlin. The world needs one language, and a new language – simple,
accurate. The pronunciation has to be according to the spelling, so that
there is now way to mispronounce a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it is going to be our work sooner or later to create a new
language which gives scope enough for all types of experiences. Right
now, there is no way, so just out of compulsion we have called our
approach to life, Rajneeshism. But if you think of it as an “ism,” you
don’t understand it. If it is an “ism” for you, throw it. If you
understand that this is only a label – out of compulsion we had to call
it that, to use it – then you will not ask such a question.</p><p>We are not a religion in the same sense Christianity is, Judaism is,
Hinduism is. But what to do with the American bureaucracy? Unless I am a
religious leader, they cannot allow me to stay here. I am nobody’s
leader, and certainly not a religious leader. I am destroying all the
roots of all the religions. But they won’t understand it; I had to
accept their stupidity and call myself a religious leader. They don’t
have any other category.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day my secretary was saying to me, “Somewhere you have
said you are an anarchist. If the American government comes to know
about it.… They have a basic rule that no anarchist should be allowed to
become a resident of America.” They do not understand. I am not an
anarchist like Prince Kropotkin. Prince Kropotkin wanted governments to
be dissolved immediately; he said there was no need of any government. I
think he was a little bit crazy.</p><p>Governments in existence.… There is so much crime, so many murders,
so many rapes, so many drugs, thefts. Just think, if for twenty-four
hours the government stops functioning – just a holiday – for
twenty-four hours there is no law, no government, what do you think will
happen in America? Thousands will be murdered, thousands will commit
suicide. Everywhere there will be stealing, everywhere there will be
cheating. And it is only for twenty-four hours that the law is no more
applicable, so you have to do it fast, whatever you always wanted to
do.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has not come to the point where governments can be dissolved.
Prince Kropotkin is against the government, the law. He wants to
dissolve them. I am also an anarchist, but in a totally opposite way to
Prince Kropotkin.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to raise the consciousness of human beings to the point where
government becomes futile, courts remain empty, nobody is murdered,
nobody is raped, nobody is tortured or harassed. Do you see the
difference? His emphasis is: dissolve the governments. My emphasis is:
raise the consciousness of human beings to the point where governments
become, of their own accord, useless; to the point that courts start
closing, that police start disappearing because there is now work,
judges are told, “Find some other job.” I am an anarchist from a very
different dimension. But my secretary was afraid that they would not
understand. To them, anarchism means Prince Kropotkin.</p><p>I am against Prince Kropotkin and his anarchism because he is talking
nonsense. First let people be ready – and governments will disappear on
their own account. I am not in favor of destroying governments; they are
fulfilling a certain need. Man is so barbarous, so ugly, that if he is
not prevented by force, the whole society will be in a chaos. Prince
Kropotkin is not an anarchist, he is in favor of chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not in favor of chaos. I want human society to become a
harmonious whole, a vast commune all around the world: People
meditating, people without guilt, people with great serenity, silence;
people rejoicing, dancing, singing; people who have no desire to compete
with anybody; people who</p><p><br></p><p>have dropped the very idea that they are special and have to prove it
by becoming the president of America; people who are no longer suffering
from any inferiority complex, so nobody wants to be superior, nobody
brags about his greatness.</p><p>The governments will evaporate like dewdrops in the early morning
sun. But that is a totally different story, a totally different
approach. Till that moment comes, governments are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a simple thing. If you are sick, medicines are needed. Prince
Kropotkin wants to destroy the medicines. I want you to be healthy so
you don’t need medicines. Automatically you will throw them – what will
you do with all those medicines? They are utterly useless, in fact,
dangerous; most of the medicines are poisons. For what purpose will you
go on accumulating them? See the difference of emphasis.</p><p>I am not against medicines, I am against the sickness of man which
makes medicines necessary. I would like a healthier man – which is
possible – a man who has no possibility of becoming sick, because we
have programmed him from his very birth that he cannot be sick, we have
made arrangements in his body to fight against any sickness. Certainly
medicines will disappear, medical stores will disappear, doctors will
disappear, medical colleges will be closed. But I am not against them!
That will be simply a consequence of a healthy humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I am an anarchist, and if the American government wants to bring
in the question of anarchism, I am going to fight, because my anarchism
is totally different. Perhaps they have never heard the distinction.
They don’t know that these are two totally different things; you cannot
put them under one name. But that’s how languages are, because we have
not made languages scientifically. They have grown blindly,
unconsciously, taken new colors, new meanings. As time changes,
languages don’t change. The words remain the same, they just acquire new
meanings.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, there is a word “babu.” It is thought to be very respectful
to address somebody as babu. The great leaders of the country, like
Subhash Chandra Bhose, are called Babu Subhash Chandra Bhose. Nobody
bothers about where the word has come from. And it is not very ancient –
only three hundred years old.</p><p><br></p><p>When the Britishers invaded India their capital was Calcutta, in
Bengal. Only later on when they conquered the whole country and
consolidated themselves did they move to the ancient capital of the
country, Delhi. Before that Calcutta was their capital.</p><p>Bengalis, the people who live in Calcutta and around Calcutta, in the
whole big state of Bengal, eat only rice and fish. They love fish so
much that anybody who can afford it will have, just beyond the house, a
big pond where he grows fish. Just as you see in other countries a
beautiful lawn and trees and gardens, in Bengal you will see ponds,
according to each one’s capacity.…</p><p>If you are rich you will have a big pond, surrounded by big trees,
lawns. If you are a poor man, you will have just a naked pond, without
trees, without lawns, but you will have a pond – dirty – and you will
grow fish. And the people smell of fish. The word bu simply means
stinking. The word ba simply means with.</p><p><br></p><p>The British people came in contact first with the Bengalis. Later
they came to discover other people –</p><p>India is a vast continent: so many cultures, so many different kinds
of people – but their first</p><p><br></p><p>acquaintance was with Bengalis. And they were smelling so badly of
fish, all the Bengalis, that it was a word of condemnation to call them
babu. Britishers started calling Bengalis, babus. It was sheer insult,
humiliation. But to be close to the people who have the power... the
word “babu” slowly became very respectable. It meant to be close to the
throne, to be close to the hierarchy. And everybody forgot its basic
meaning.</p><p>Now, the first president of India was called Babu Rajendra Prasad. He
had nothing to do with fish, he was not a stinking man, but he never
told people, “You should stop calling me babu,” because he himself might
not have been aware what the word means. And if the president is called
babu, then anybody will feel joyous and grateful if he is called
babu.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my vice-chancellors called me babu. I said, “Shut up! And take
your words back immediately;</p><p>otherwise I can be dangerous.”</p><p>He said, “What are you doing? Have you gone suddenly insane? I have
not said anything, I simply said, out of respect, babu.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It does not matter that you are ignorant about the meaning
of babu. I know the meaning.”</p><p>When I explained it to him, he said, “My God! I used to think this
was a very respectful word, and I enjoyed being called babu. I used to
use the word for people for whom I have a certain respect. But forgive
me; I will never use that word again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Old languages have become rotten. A new language is an absolute need
– totally new, without any flaws, exact in its meaning. The older the
language, the more meanings its words have. In Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew,
Greek, Latin, one word has many meanings.</p><p><br></p><p>In Sanskrit one word can have one dozen meanings. Slowly, slowly a
word got settled with one meaning, but those eleven meanings are there.
Because of this, Indian philosophers and scholars were very much at
ease; disputing, making new commentaries on the old scriptures was an
easy job, because each word has ten, twelve meanings, so you can manage
to make the scripture mean whatsoever you want it to mean. Another
philosopher writes a treatise on the same scripture, and he gives it a
totally different meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu scripture, GITA – which is the bible of the Hindus – has
one thousand commentaries. That is the number of famous commentaries.
There may be many more, but they are not famous; they were written by
people who never attained fame, who never attained the attention of the
country. But one thousand commentaries on one book!</p><p><br></p><p>If you read one commentary, you will say, “Perfectly right.” If you
read a second commentary, you will be surprised – that too is perfectly
right. And when you have read one thousand commentaries, as I have, you
will say, “Crazy! Nuts! They are just playing with words.” All the
commentaries are contradicting each other. The game is very easy, the
language allows it. This is an unscientific language.</p><p>I want one world, one language, one religiousness, one humanity, and
when humanity is really grown-up in consciousness, one government.</p><p><br></p><p>Government is not something to brag about. It is an insult. Its
existence says to you that you are still barbarous, civilization has not
happened; otherwise what is the need of a government to rule you?</p><p>If all the crimes disappear, if all the fears that others can exploit
you, murder you, disappear, what will you do with this whole bureaucracy
of government? You cannot continue it, because it is a burden on the
economy of the nation, a big burden, and it goes on becoming bigger and
bigger. The hierarchies have a tendency to become bigger and bigger, for
the simple reason that everybody wants not to work, everybody hates
work. So everybody needs more assistance; the work is growing.</p><p>You can see, in any government office, files just piled up on the
tables. Unless you are able to bribe someone, your file may remain
somewhere in the huge pile, it will never come to the top. And the
bureaucrats enjoy many files there; that makes them big, special. They
have power over so many people; all these files, to them contain their
power over people.</p><p><br></p><p>Files don’t move unless you are after them. Bribe one table, the file
moves to a higher table. Bribe again, it moves to a higher table. The
moment you stop bribing, the file stops moving. Strange, it seems
bribery is something like petrol: for the car to go on moving, you have
to put petrol in. If you are out of gas, finished, the car has
stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>I am an anarchist of a totally different category from all the
anarchists who have existed on the earth. I am a category in myself,
because my approach is totally different. I am not against government, I
am against the need for government. I am not against the courts, I am
against the need for the courts.</p><p><br></p><p>Someday, some time, I see the possibility that man will be able to
live without any control – religious or political – because he will be a
discipline unto himself.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SAY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OURSELVES, AND THAT THERE IS NO GOD.
WHAT PART DO FATE AND DESTINY HAVE IN OUR LIVES? OR ARE THEY JUST
EXCUSES TO AVOID OUR RESPONSIBILITIES BY PINNING HOPE ON SOMETHING
OUTSIDE OURSELVES?</p><p><br></p><p>They are just excuses and nothing more. There is no fate, no destiny.
You are just trying to dump your responsibility on something which does
not exist. And because it does not exist, it cannot resist you; it
cannot say, Please don’t dump your responsibility on me!” God is silent,
you can dump anything on him – no resistance, because there is nobody to
resist.</p><p><br></p><p>Fate is again the same. You fail in love, you fail in other matters.
It hurts, that “I have failed.” You need some kind of ointment for your
wounded heart. Fate is a beautiful ointment, and freely available, you
don’t have to pay for it. You say, “What can I do? – everything is
decided by fate.” Success or failure, richness or poverty, sickness or
health, life or death – everything is in the hands of an unknown power
called fate. “I am doing my best, still I go on failing. I am following
all the moral principles preached to me, still I am poor. And I see all
kinds of immoral people becoming richer, getting higher, becoming
famous. It is all fate.”</p><p><br></p><p>It gives you solace. It gives you solace that you are not reaching
your goals. It also gives you solace that if others have reached, there
is nothing much in it; it is just decided by fate. So on the one hand,
you are saved from feeling inferior; on the other hand, your jealousy
enjoys the idea that the successful is successful only because fate has
determined it that way: “It has nothing to do with him, he’s not
superior to me.”</p><p>God, fate, destiny– they all come in the same category: throwing your
responsibility onto something which does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>If God existed he would not remain silent. I am continually saying he
does not exist. If he existed, it is time – he should have appeared in
Rajneeshpuram and announced, “I am here! Why do you go on saying that I
don’t exist?” But he will never come. There have always been people who
have denied the existence of God, but he has never made any effort to
prove himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Simple things Edmund Burke, one of the philosophers of the West,
stood in the church and said to</p><p>the priest, “This is my watch. If God exists – I don’t want big
proof, just a simple proof – my watch should stop moving. You pray, your
congregation can pray, you do anything that you want to do. Persuade
your God to stop my watch, and that will be enough to convert me.”</p><p>They prayed – it was a question of the prestige of the whole of
Christianity, a single man challenging God. And he was not asking for a
big miracle, just a small miracle: “Stop my watch moving.” And God could
not do that. Edmund Burke has proved that there is no God. What an
argument! – but simple, clear, relevant.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on dumping – all over the world – anything that you want to
get rid of on God, on fate, on destiny. They are just different names of
non-existential things. Certainly you cannot throw your garbage on
somebody who is there. There is a limit to patience.</p><p>You just try throwing your garbage into the compound of your
neighbor. Perhaps for one day he may not say anything; perhaps for two
days he may wait – but how long? Sooner or later he is going to grab you
by the neck and prove that “I exist. You cannot go on throwing your
garbage in my compound.” But if there is nobody in the house, you can
continue to throw the garbage as long as you want. Nobody will resist,
nobody will come out and say, “What is going on? Don’t you have any
sense of humanity in you?”</p><p><br></p><p>God, fate, destiny – these are bogus words, mumbo jumbo, nothing more
than that. Drop them completely, because dropping them will make you an
individual, fully responsible for your acts. And unless you take the
responsibility on yourself, you will never become strong, you will never
become independent, you will never have the taste of freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have freedom. But the cost is to accept responsibility in its
totality.</p><p><br></p><p>I have felt such immense freedom that looking at you I feel sad. You
have the same opportunity, the same potentiality to blossom into a free
individual, but you go on remaining a slave. And the way you manage it
is by never being responsible. You think not being responsible makes you
free? Not feeling responsible for your actions, for your thoughts, for
your being, do you think you are freed from all the consequences? No,
absolutely no.</p><p><br></p><p>It makes you a slave, it makes you something subhuman. It takes all
glory away from you. You cannot walk straight, you become a hunchback.
Your intelligence cannot grow because you have not accepted the
challenge. You are waiting for fate, for destiny, for God. You are
thinking, “When the time comes – the right time, God willing – I will be
blissful too.” There is no God who can will your blissfulness. You are
alone in existence.</p><p>You come alone, you die alone. Between birth and death, of course you
can deceive yourself that someone is with you – your wife, your father,
your mother, your husband, your friend – but this is just make-believe.
You come alone, you go alone; you are alone between birth and death.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying that you cannot love a man or a woman. In fact,
when two independent, free people, who take responsibility on their own
shoulders, meet, there is immense beauty in it. Nobody is a burden to
the other. Nobody is dumping anything onto the other’ you have stopped
the very idea of dumping anything. You can be together, but your
aloneness remains untouched, pure, crystal- clear, virgin. You never
trespass each other’s territories. You can enjoy each other just because
you are separate.</p><p><br></p><p>The more separate you are – the more clearly it is understood that
you are alone, she is alone – the more there is a possibility of a great
meeting of two alonenesses, two purities, two individuals.</p><p>Forget words like destiny, fate, kismet, God. And don’t allow
yourself to be cheated by astrologers, mind readers, palmists,
predictors of your future. There is no future if you don’t create it!
And whatsoever is going to be tomorrow is going to be your creation. And
it has to be done today, now – because out of today, today’s womb,
tomorrow will be born.</p><p><br></p><p>Take the responsibility totally on yourselves – that’s my message to
you. That’s why I am continuously destroying the God in your mind. I
have nothing against him. How can I have anything against him? – he does
not exist! Do you think I am wasting my time fighting with something
which does not exist? No, I am fighting with your conditionings; they
exist. God does not exist, but an idea of God exists in you, and I am
fighting with that idea, telling you to drop it, be clean, and take the
whole responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my experience: the day I took my whole responsibility on
myself, I found the doors of freedom opening to me. They go
together.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody wants freedom. Nobody wants responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>You will never have freedom, you will remain a slave. Remember,
remaining a slave is also your responsibility. You have chosen it, it
has not been forced upon you.</p><p>I am reminded of Diogenes, a beautiful Greek philosopher, mystic –
and a mystic of a rare quality. He was a contemporary of Aristotle, and
he was as much against Aristotle as I am, so I have a certain friendship
with Diogenes.</p><p><br></p><p>Aristotle defined man as an animal who walks on two legs. What did
Diogenes do? He caught one animal – and there are many animals who walk
on two legs, but they have feathers also, they can</p><p><br></p><p>fly also – a peacock. He took out all the feathers – because men have
no feathers. Take out all the feathers of the peacock... the peacock
walks on two legs. And he sent the peacock to Aristotle with the
message: “Please receive the gift of a human being.”</p><p>This man Diogenes used to live naked, because he said, “Man is born
naked, and he becomes weaker because he is protected by clothes.” All
around the world no animal has clothes – except a few dogs in England.
England is a mysterious country. Dogs have clothes because a naked dog
is un-Christian. You will be surprised to know that in the Middle Ages
in England even chair legs were covered with clothes, because they are
legs and it is not gentlemanly to see naked legs.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes lived naked. He was a strong man. Four people who were doing
the business of hijacking people and selling them as slaves in the
market thought, “This is a great catch, this man can bring us great
money. We have sold many slaves, but not so strong, beautiful, young. We
can have as high a price as we demand; and there is going to be a great
competition in the marketplace when we put this man on the pedestal for
sale. But,” they thought, “four are not enough to catch him. He alone
could kill us all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes was hearing what they were saying about him. He was sitting
by the side of the river, just enjoying the cool breeze of the evening,
underneath a tree; and behind the tree, those four were planning what to
do. He said, “Don’t be worried. Come here! You need not worry that I
will kill you, I never kill anything. And you need not worry that I will
fight, resist you – no. I don’t fight anybody, I don’t resist anything.
You want to sell me as a slave?”</p><p>Embarrassed, afraid, those four people said, “That’s what we were
thinking. We are poor... if you are willing?”</p><p>He said, “Of course I am. If I can help you in your poverty in some
way, it is beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>So they brought out chains. He said, “Throw them in the river; you
need not chain me. I will walk ahead of you. I don’t believe in escaping
from anything. In fact, I am getting excited about the idea of being
sold, standing on a high pedestal, and hundreds of people trying to get
me. I am excited about this auction – I am coming!”</p><p>Those four people became a little more afraid: this man is not only
strong, beautiful, he seems to be mad also; he is dangerous. But now
there was no way for them to escape. He said, “If you try to escape, you
will be risking your own life. Just follow me, all four of you. Put me
on the pedestal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Unwillingly they followed him. They wanted to take him, but he went!
You see the point? Even in such a situation, he was taking the
responsibility on himself. He was a free man even in such a situation,
where these people are conspiring and trying to sell him in the
marketplace, which is the ugliest thing that can happen to a man – to be
sold like a commodity, auctioned like a commodity.</p><p><br></p><p>But he told those people, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t try to escape.
You have given me a great idea, I am grateful to you. This is my
responsibility, I am going to the marketplace. You put me up for
auction.”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not believe... what type of man was this? But there was no
way to escape, so they followed him. And when he was put on a high
pedestal so that everybody could see, there was</p><p><br></p><p>almost silence, pindrop silence. People had never seen such a
proportionate body, so beautiful – as if made of steel, so strong.</p><p>Before the auctioneer said anything, Diogenes declared, “Listen,
people! Here is a master to be sold to any slave, because these four
poor people need money. So start the auction; but remember, you are
purchasing a master.”</p><p><br></p><p>A king purchased him. Of course, he could do it – more and more money
he offered at the auction. Many people were interested, but finally a
sum, larger than any which had ever been heard of, was given to those
four people. Diogenes said to them, “Are you happy now? You can go, and
I will go with this slave.”</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, when they were moving to the palace in the chariot, the
king said to Diogenes, “Are you crazy or something? You think yourself a
master? I am a king, and you think me a slave?”</p><p>Diogenes said, “Yes, and I am not crazy, you are crazy. I can prove
it right now.” At the back of the chariot was the queen. Diogenes said,
“Your queen is already interested in me, she is finished with you. It is
dangerous to purchase a master.”</p><p>The king was shocked. Of course, he was nothing in comparison to
Diogenes. He took out his sword and asked his queen, “What he is saying,
is it true? If you say the truth, your life will be saved – that is my
promise. But if you say an untruth, and I find it out later on, I will
behead you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fearful, afraid, still the queen said, “It is true. Before him, you
are nothing. I am enchanted, allured; the man has some magic. You are
just a poor guy compared to him. This is the truth.”</p><p>Of course, the king stopped the chariot and told Diogenes, “Get out
of the chariot. I make you free; I</p><p>don’t want to take such risks in my palace.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “Thank you. I am a man who cannot be made a slave, for
the simple reason that every responsibility I take on myself. I have not
left those four people feeling guilty – they had not brought me there, I
had come of my own accord. They must be feeling obliged. And it is your
chariot, if you want me to get out, that is perfectly good. I am not
accustomed to chariots at all, my legs are strong enough. And I am a
naked man, a golden chariot does not fit with me.”</p><p>Take responsibility! And then even in utter poverty, suffering,
imprisoned in a jail, you will remain completely a master of yourself.
You will have a freedom which comes with responsibility.</p><p>All these religions have been making you dependent on God, on fate,
on destiny. Those are just different names of something non-existential.
What is true is your slavery or your freedom. Choose. If you choose
freedom, then you have to destroy all the strategies of religions which
make you a slave. That’s what I am doing here: cutting all your chains,
making you free from everything, so that you can be yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment you are yourself, you start growing, you become
greener. Flowers start opening up, and there is great fragrance around
you.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s14>31</span></p><p><br></p><p>No religions, no nations, no governments</p><p><br></p><p>2 9 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOUR WAY IS THE WAY OF THE HEART, AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS THE WAY OF
THE HEAD. WILL IT EVER BE POSSIBLE THAT MAN CAN FUNCTION FROM A BLEND OF
BOTH HEAD AND HEART, OR MUST THE TWO ALWAYS REMAIN TOTALLY DIVORCED?
WILL IT ALWAYS BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER?</p><p>The first thing to be understood is that there is no way, either of
head or of heart. Every way leads you away, away from the truth that you
are.</p><p>It would have been so easy if there were a truth somewhere. Howsoever
difficult the way, people would have reached. The more difficult, the
more far away the truth was, the more challenging to the ego. If man’s
ego challenges him to reach the highest peak in the Himalayas, Everest,
where nothing is to be found; if man’s ego gives him incentive to waste
billions of dollars to reach the moon, risking lives.… But man has
reached the moon. And the first man who walked on the moon must have
looked silly to himself – there was nothing for which so much endeavor,
technology, preparation was needed.</p><p>Remember, the ego wants challenges. It lives through challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Why have so few people been able to have a glimpse of the truth? –
because it is not a challenge; it is not there, it is here within you.
It does not need any way, you are already it.</p><p>But the question has one other implication too: Will it ever be
possible for the head and heart to be married, or are they going to
remain forever divorced? It all depends on you, because both are
mechanisms. You are neither the head nor the heart. You can move through
the head, you can move through the heart. Of course you will reach
different places because the directions of the head and the heart are
diametrically opposite.</p><p>The head will go round and round thinking, brooding, philosophizing;
it knows only words, logic, argument. But it is very infertile; you
cannot get anything out of the head as far as truth is concerned,
because truth needs no logic, no argument, no philosophical research.
Truth is so simple; the head makes it so complex. Down the centuries
philosophers have been seeking and searching for the truth through the
head. None of them has found anything, but they have created great
systems of thought. I have looked into all those systems: there is no
conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is also a mechanism – different from the head. You can call
the head the logical instrument; you can call the heart the emotional
instrument. Out of the head all the philosophies, all the theologies are
created; out of the heart, come all kinds of devotion, prayer,
sentimentality. But the heart also goes round and round in emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “emotion” is good. Watch... it consists of motion, movement.
So the heart moves, but the heart is blind. It moves fast, quick,
because there is no reason to wait. It does not have to think, so it
jumps into anything. But truth is not to be found by any emotionality.
Emotion is as much a barrier as logic.</p><p><br></p><p>The logic is the male in you, and the heart is the female in you. But
truth has nothing to do with male and female. Truth is your
consciousness. You can watch the head thinking, you can watch the heart
throbbing with emotion. They can be in a certain relationship.…</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, the society has arranged that the head should be the
master and the heart should be the servant, because society is the
creation of man’s mind, psychology, and the heart is feminine. Just as
man has kept the woman a slave, the head has kept the heart a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>We can reverse the situation: the heart can become the master, the
head can become the servant. If we have to choose between the two, if we
are forced to choose between the two, then it is better that the heart
becomes the master and the head becomes the servant.</p><p>There are things which the heart is incapable of. Exactly the same is
true about the head. The head cannot love, it cannot feel, it is
insensitive. The heart cannot be rational, reasonable. For the whole
past they have been in conflict. That conflict only represents the
conflict and struggle between men and women.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are talking to your wife, you must know it is impossible to
talk, it is impossible to argue, it is impossible to come to a fair
decision, because the woman functions through the heart. She jumps from
one thing to another without bothering whether there is any relationship
between the two. She cannot argue, but she can cry. She cannot be
rational, but she can scream. She cannot be cooperative in coming to a
conclusion. The heart cannot understand the language of the head.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is not much as far as physiology is concerned, the
heart and the head are just a few inches apart from each other. But as
far as their existential qualities are concerned, they are poles
apart.</p><p>My way has been described as that of the heart, but it is not true.
The heart will give you all kinds of imaginings, hallucinations,
illusions, sweet dreams – but it cannot give you the truth. The truth is
behind both; it is in your consciousness, which is neither head nor
heart. Just because the consciousness is separate from both, it can use
both in harmony. The head is dangerous in certain fields, because it has
eyes but it has no legs – it is crippled.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart can function in certain dimensions. It has no eyes but it
has legs; it is blind but it can move tremendously, with great speed –
of course, not knowing where it is going. It is not just a coincidence
that in all the languages of the world love is called blind. It is not
love that is blind, it is the heart that has no eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>As your meditation becomes deeper, as your identification with the
head and the heart starts falling, you find yourself becoming a
triangle. And your reality is in the third force in you: the
consciousness. Consciousness can manage very easily, because the heart
and the head both belong to it.</p><p>You know the story of a blind beggar and a crippled beggar They both
lived outside the village in</p><p>the forest. Of course, they were competitors to each other, enemies –
begging is a business. But one day the forest was on fire. The cripple
had no way to escape, because he could not move on his own. He had eyes
to see which way they could get out of the fire, but what use is that if
you don’t have legs? The blind man had legs, could move fast and get out
of the fire, but how was he going to find the place where the fire had
not reached yet?</p><p>Both were going to die in the forest, burned alive. It was such an
emergency that they forgot their competition. In such emergencies only a
Jew can remain a businessman, and certainly those two beggars were not
Jews. In fact, to be a beggar and a Jew is a contradiction in terms.</p><p><br></p><p>They immediately dropped their antagonism – that was the only way to
survive. The blind man took the cripple on his shoulders, they found the
way out of the fire. One was seeing, and the other was moving
accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Something like this has to happen within you – of course, in reverse
order. The head has the eyes, the heart has the guts to move into
anything. You have to make a synthesis between the two. And the
synthesis, I have to emphasize, should be that the heart remains the
master, and the head becomes the servant.</p><p><br></p><p>You have as a servant a great asset – your reasoning. You cannot be
befooled, you cannot be cheated and exploited. The heart has all
feminine qualities: love, beauty, grace. The head is barbarous. The
heart is far more civilized, far more innocent.</p><p>A conscious man uses his head as a servant, and his heart as the
master – just the opposite of the story I told you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is so simple for the man of consciousness to do. Once you
are unidentified with head or heart, and you are simply a witness of
both, you can see which qualities should be higher, which</p><p><br></p><p>qualities should be the goal. And the head as a servant can bring
those qualities, but it needs to be commanded and ordered. Right now,
and for centuries, just the opposite has been happening: the servant has
become the master. And the master is so polite, such a gentleman, that
he has not fought back, he has accepted the slavery voluntarily. The
madness on the earth is the result.</p><p>We have to change the very alchemy of man. We have to rearrange the
whole inside of man.</p><p>And the most basic revolution in man will come when the heart decides
the values. It cannot decide for war, it cannot go for nuclear weapons;
it cannot be death-oriented. The heart is life’s juice. Once the head is
in the service of the heart, it has to do what the heart decides. And
the head is immensely capable of doing anything, just right guidance is
needed; otherwise, it is going to go berserk, it is going to be mad. For
the head there are no values. For the head there is no meaning in
anything. For the head there is no love, no beauty, no grace – only
reasoning.</p><p>But this miracle is possible only by disidentifying yourself from
both. Watch the thoughts, because in your watching them, they disappear.
Then watch your emotions, sentimentalities; by your watching, they also
disappear. Then your heart is as innocent as that of a child, and your
head is as great a genius as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell,
Aristotle.</p><p><br></p><p>But the trouble is far bigger than you can conceive. It is a
male-dominated society; man has been creating all the rules of the game,
the woman has just been following. And the conditioning has gone so
deep, because it has been going on for millions of years.</p><p><br></p><p>If in the individual the revolution happens and the heart is
re-enthroned, given its right place as the master, and the head given
the right place as a great servant, this will affect your whole social
structure. You can see it happening in my commune.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman is the master; she is not longer mistress, and the man is
no longer master. People go on asking me why, for all significant posts,
I have chosen women? For the simple reason that the woman will not
create the third world war.</p><p>It has been a historical fact that each war is created by the man,
but the woman suffers most. Strange – the man is the criminal and the
consequence happens to the woman! The woman loses her husband, the woman
loses her children. The woman loses her dignity, because whenever a
country is invaded, the soldiers are so much repressed – just like the
monks Sexually they had</p><p>no opportunity while the war was going on. When the opportunity
arises – they invade a city and conquer it – their first attack is on
the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>And the war has nothing to do with the woman, she is simply outside
of the game – it is a male game, just like boxing – but she has to be
raped. Those soldiers are hankering not to be victorious for their
nation’s glory – that is a faraway thing – they are hankering to get the
women of the enemies as quickly as possible.</p><p>I am putting women in all significant, powerful positions. It is
symbolic. Man has a tremendous capacity to do things, but he should not
be the guide anymore. He is hung up in his head. He</p><p><br></p><p>can also become the master if he puts his heart above his head.
That’s why I said that all of my sannyasins are women – even those who
biologically, physiologically, are men. The moment they become
sannyasins they have accepted a new structure, they have put something
above their head – their heart.</p><p>This is what I mean: that even men around me start learning feminine
qualities. And feminine qualities are the only qualities worth
having.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is a possibility, but the possibility has a basic condition
to be fulfilled: you become more conscious, a witness, a watcher of all
that goes on inside you. The watcher becomes immediately free from
identification. Because he can see the emotions, it is an absolute
certainty that “I am not the emotions.” He can see the thoughts; the
simple conclusion is, “I am not my thought process.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then who am I?” – a pure watcher, a witness. And you reach to the
ultimate possibility of intelligence in you: You become a conscious
man.</p><p>Amongst the whole world sleeping, you become awake, and once you are
awake there is no problem. Your very awakening will start shifting
things to their right places. The head has to be dethroned, and the
heart has to be crowned again. This change amongst many people will
bring a new society, a New Man in the world. It will change so many
things, you cannot conceive.</p><p><br></p><p>Science will have a totally different flavor. It will not serve death
anymore, it will not make weapons that are going to kill the whole of
life on the earth. It will make life richer, discover energies which can
make man more fulfilled, which can make man live in comfort, in luxury,
because the values will have completely changed. It will still be mind
functioning, but under the direction of the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>My way is the way of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to use language, unfortunately, that’s why I say may way is
the way of meditation: Neither of</p><p>head nor of heart, but of a growing consciousness which is above both
mind and heart. This is the key to open the doors for a New Man to
arrive on the earth.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I WAS BROUGHT UP AS A QUAKER, AND WE WERE TOLD NEVER TO SWEAR ON A
BIBLE IN COURT, BECAUSE AS QUAKERS WE COULD ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND
THAT THE SOURCE OF OUR TRUTH WAS SILENCE. THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHAT YOU
SAY, I AM SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE THEOLOGY OF
QUAKERISM.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: Quakerism is part of Christian theology. I have
never said anything against Quakerism, but you are forcing me to
now.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a by-product of Christian theology, and I am against all
theologies. Quakerism is not an independent religion, but just a sect of
Christianity. It accepts all kinds of stupidities that are propounded by
Jesus and his theologians. It is not against THE BIBLE – and THE BIBLE
is so full of rubbish, lies.</p><p>The basic lie is God, the holy ghost, Jesus the only begotten son of
God. Lies upon lies – a virgin birth, resurrection after being
crucified. Quakerism does not deny all these things, it accepts
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you are saying you have been told not to take oath upon the
BIBLE in the court. I have also said that the oath is absolutely
unnecessary. A man who is capable of lying – no oath can prevent him.
And to take an oath placing your hand on THE BIBLE is hilarious. THE
BIBLE is so full of lies, and you are taking an oath for truth – that
you will not speak anything but truth!</p><p><br></p><p>My reason not to take an oath on any religious scripture is totally
different from that of the Quakers. The Quakers believe – remember, they
believe: I know. You have been told: I have seen.</p><p>And the difference is infinite between being told and experiencing it
on your own.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by being told that because you are a Quaker whatsoever you speak
will be truth.… This is strange. It is a belief, borrowed knowledge,
conditioning. Just by your being a Quaker, it is not a certainty that
whatsoever you speak will be the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, if you have experienced total silence, then nothing can come out
of you which is not true.</p><p><br></p><p>But I know many Quakers. They sit in silence also in their
congregations. I have been to their congregations, and I have asked
them, “If you are really truthful, tell me: What were you doing in your
silence?” And they have always said, “We were thinking – thinking of
silence, trying to be silent, making efforts to be silent.” Yes, it is
true they are not speaking. If you mean just by not speaking you are
silent, then you are just a fool.</p><p>Silence is such a deep experience, where thoughts, emotions,
everything disappears. If you have attained to that silence you will not
even call yourself a Quaker. You will not subscribe to any theology. You
don’t need one; you have found the very source of truth within
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The Quakers have been defying the court; they will not take the oath.
They have been punished for it, because it is an insult to the court, it
is contempt of the court: they have been imprisoned, tortured. But the
Quaker and my sannyasin are totally different.</p><p>I say the oath is useless. But I teach my sannyasins to be
nonserious. To the Quakers it has become something of a dogmatic idea, a
fanatic standpoint: they will not take the oath. I tell my sannyasins,
“You live in a society, you have to follow their rules – remembering
that they are all man-made.”</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in some countries you have to drive on the right side of
the road, in some countries on the left side of the road. What is wrong
with the right side? You can say that it makes no difference whether you
drive on the right side or left side, it is simply a rule. Don’t Quakers
follow this simple rule? You don’t take it seriously, there is no
problem in it; it is simply a question of managing the traffic. It can
be done in both ways, so there is nothing serious about it. It is not
something like an ultimate law of existence, that if you drive on the
right side you will go to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Quakers have been going to jail. I will not tell my sannyasins to do
that. It is not worth it. Take the oath, and say whatsoever you want to
say. Oath or no oath, it makes no difference to your statements. Why
unnecessarily enrage those poor judges and juries? Let them be
satisfied. If they are feeling happy just by your taking an oath, and
feeling that now whatever you say will be the truth, let them befool
themselves. You have to say what you want to say. The oath is irrelevant
to you, but why make so much fuss about it that you have to go for two
years behind bars?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a nonserious man. Quakers are very serious about it. They will
risk their life, but they will not take the oath. The oath has become
more important than life itself.</p><p>It is just a game. You play cards: there is a king and there is a
queen and there is a joker, and all sorts of people are there. You know
that this is just a playing card, and this queen is just like the queen
of England – absolutely meaningless, powerless. But while playing the
game you have to accept that this is the queen, this is the king, this
is the joker, and so on, so forth. You don’t start going to jail because
“I will not accept this card as the king!” It is up to you – don’t play
the game.</p><p>These are all games. That is the difference. You are asking me what
the difference is, why I criticize Quaker theology. In fact, I have
never done it before, but from now onwards I am going to do it unless
you start quaking! To take games of life seriously shows only your
stupidity, not your silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in the courts. I have taken an oath, but before I take
the oath I certainly make a statement telling the judge, “I will follow
the rule, I will take the oath, but the oath cannot make any difference
to me. I will speak only that which I want to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“And your oath, in fact, frees me from telling the truth and only the
truth, because the oath I am taking on THE BIBLE, on the GITA, on the
KORAN – which are full of lies... naturally by taking the oath on THE
BIBLE I am completely freed. Now I can lie without any trouble. Without
an oath I will only speak the truth; with an oath, there is no need
because I have already lied by putting my hand on THE BIBLE.”</p><p>Quakers are not against THE BIBLE – I am. In one court I refused to
put my hand on THE BIBLE. I</p><p>said, “I will keep a little distance.”</p><p><br></p><p>The judge asked, “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Because it is such garbage I don’t want to touch it. It is
your rule, so I will put my hand on top of it, but I will keep a little
distance. I am very allergic.” There is an immense difference between my
criticism of this system of oath taking and the Quakers’ criticism.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying that just because you are a sannyasin that’s enough
to guarantee that you will speak only the truth, no. Just being
sannyasins does not mean that you will only speak the truth. And it is
not so easy to decide what the truth is.</p><p>It happened that one of the great historians was writing the history
of the whole world. It was an immense job to write the whole history of
the whole world, of all the nations. He devoted almost fifty years,
working almost twelve, fourteen hours a day. And the day he was coming
to his last page, something happened and he burned his whole life’s
effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody was murdered just in the neighborhood. Of course, so many
people gathered there: the police were there, the journalists were
there. The historian also went there. He asked one person who was an
eyewitness, he asked another person who was an eyewitness – and he was
amazed. The stories of all the eyewitnesses were different. And there
was no reason for them to lie, they were not involved in it.</p><p>One eyewitness said he was killed inside the house. Another
eyewitness said he was killed under the sky, the open sky. The truth was
that he was killed in a house which was just being built, and the roof
was not yet there. He was killed under the open sky – without the roof
you can’t call it a house. But it was a house in the process of being
built. The roof is only a part of the house, so the other was not lying
either, saying that he was killed inside the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to other eyewitnesses, he became suddenly aware of one
thing: “A murder happens in my neighborhood; within two minutes’ time I
am there, eyewitnesses are available – and it cannot be decided what
actually happened. I have been wasting my whole life writing about
Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah – so much time has passed. Can I say
truthfully that what I have written is factual? Perhaps many of these
people never existed!”</p><p>George Gurdjieff had a theory about Jesus Christ: that he never
existed, that it is only an ancient drama which was played amongst the
Jews, there has never been a historical man Jesus. And he supported his
idea that it is only a drama, just like the dramas of Shakespeare and
Bernard Shaw. His first piece of evidence was that Jesus is not
mentioned in any Jewish book.</p><p>Such a man, who could walk on water, do you think he would not create
news? Would he not be mentioned somewhere in the contemporary
literature? A man who can raise the dead back to life – if he is not
mentioned, then who else will be mentioned? This man was doing all kinds
of miracles: turning stones into bread, turning water into wine.… And
the resurrection – he was crucified but God would not allow his only
begotten Son to be dead, so he came back again.</p><p><br></p><p>These things make a man so significant that you cannot ignore him,
yet in no Jewish history he is even mentioned, not even in the
footnotes! George Gurdjieff has an argument there; he says it is simply
a drama. Nobody has been able to criticize George Gurdjieff; you cannot
find anything that can contradict what he is saying. So what is the
truth?</p><p><br></p><p>Take the oath; if that is the rule of the game, play it accordingly.
But make it clear that it makes no difference to you.</p><p>Perhaps it was making a difference to people in the past. And I say
to you, it will make a difference to the Quakers too, because they
believe in THE BIBLE, they believe in the biblical God, they believe in
the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The whole Christian theology is
theirs.</p><p>If you believe in God, you feel afraid taking the oath in the name of
God – the superstitious man will feel afraid: now it is not a question
of the court, it is now a question of God and the holy book. To lie now
will not only be a crime, it will be a sin also. Afraid of this, there
is a possibility he will say the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>For my sannyasins there is no problem. There is no God, there is no
holy book. My sannyasins can take an oath on any novel and it will be
the same. They can take an oath on anything, it makes</p><p><br></p><p>no difference at all; they will say what they want to say. The court
cannot exploit their superstitions, because they have none.</p><p>The oath was significant, is significant, for the so-called religious
people of the world. And that’s why a Hindu is not given THE BIBLE to
take an oath on. He is given the GITA, because THE BIBLE he can spit on
without any trouble. But the GITA? If by accident the GITA falls from
his hands, or his feet by accident touch the GITA, he is in tremendous
anguish. He has to fast, and go to the holy Ganges river to take a bath:
he has committed a great sin.</p><p>Now, this man can be exploited. The court can manipulate this man to
tell the truth. But no court in the whole world can manipulate my
people. We don’t have any holy book, we don’t have any God to be afraid
of. Once you are free of superstitions, laughingly you can take the oath
and say whatsoever you always wanted to say – oath or no oath. So
remember, there is a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the court is stubborn, don’t take it seriously. It is stupid
to suffer two years in jail just for not taking the oath. And why are
you so afraid? Are you afraid because you were going to lie, and now
after the oath you cannot lie? What is the fear?</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I have been told that the Quaker only speaks the truth.”
You have been told – and the man who has told you was lying! Just being
a Quaker makes no difference. How can it make any difference? Yes,
Quakers sit in silence, but I know their silence is bogus, because they
don’t have the method to enter into silence. They just say, “We sit in
silence.” Yes, they are not talking, but they are thinking, they are
feeling – emotions are there.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence means you are a witness, and that word “witness” has no place
in the Quaker theology. And without being a witness you cannot be
silent; there is no other way. You will have to go through the whole
process of witnessing; only then, slowly, slowly, things will start
dropping away.</p><p>My people know that unless they succeed in meditation – which is
another name of witnessing – they will remain unconscious, and an
unconscious man is asleep. Can you say to a man who is just getting
ready to fall into bed and go to sleep, can you tell the man, “Please
take an oath that you will not dream about wrong things”? He may take
the oath, but he will be dreaming in the same way as he was dreaming
before.</p><p><br></p><p>The oath will not make any difference, because the oath is taken by
the conscious mind, and there are deeper layers which know nothing about
it. The unconscious mind has no idea about the oath, and the collective
unconscious mind is far deeper, and the cosmic unconscious mind is
deeper than the Pacific. They know nothing about your oath, and in sleep
they will be functioning, not your conscious mind. Your conscious mind,
which has taken the oath, will be asleep.</p><p>Sleepy people, unconscious people, can believe in anything, but their
belief makes no difference to their inner reality.</p><p>So please, forget the idea that my opposition to the oath is the same
as the Quakers’ opposition to the oath. Their opposition has different
arguments for it. They say, “Because a Quaker always speaks the truth,
that’s why we will not take the oath.”</p><p><br></p><p>I say to my sannyasins, “Make the statement in the court: ’The oath
is a very ancient superstition. I will take it, if this is the game that
I have to play, but I cannot be serious about it. It does not matter –
you can give me THE BIBLE or you can give me PLAYBOY magazine, it won’t
make any difference; I will simply say what I have to say. Your oath
cannot make any difference to my statements.”</p><p>And we are not ready to go for two years to jail for such a stupid
thing. If those judges and juries and the courts are behaving stupidly,
have you also to behave the same? Make them a laughingstock, make their
idea of oath taking foolish.</p><p>My reasoning against the oath is totally different. It has nothing to
do with your Quakerism. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>MY FEAR AROUND YOUR VISION OF THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN THROUGH
TEST-TUBES AND GENETIC ENGINEERING COMES NOT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF,
BUT FROM FEAR OF WHO MIGHT CONTROL THE TECHNOLOGY. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE
THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USED BY CONSCIOUS HUMAN BEINGS, RATHER THAN
THE IDIOT POLITICIANS WHO WOULD TURN OUR BRAVE NEW WORLD INTO ORWELL’S
1984?</p><p>Who controls the technology today?</p><p><br></p><p>Who controls all your nuclear weapons? Who controls all your
scientific discoveries?</p><p>Have you raised your voice against it? Have you even thought that the
whole life on the earth is now in the hands of idiotic politicians?</p><p><br></p><p>And it has been always so. Anything discovered is immediately
captured by the governments, so why is the question only about genetic
engineering? Are you not afraid that the politicians have nuclear
weapons which can destroy you seven hundred times? Although destroyed
once, you will not need to be destroyed again – because you are not the
only begotten son of God, you will not resurrect; and messiahs are not
around who will bring you back to life.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are afraid – I can understand – that if this genetic
engineering is in the hands of politicians, certainly they are not going
to produce the man of beauty, love, silence, intelligence, grace. They
are going to create steel robots, to make all of them soldiers to fight,
to kill. I know it. That’s why I have proposed there should not be
nations, the world should have only one functional government. All
boundaries have to be removed, all passports and green cards have to be
burned. That you are a human being is enough to enter any country.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange thing. You don’t ask the birds, “Where is your
passport? How did you dare to enter America? – you need a visa. And if
you want to remain permanently here you will need a green card.” Animals
seem to be more free than you, because animals don’t know anything about
the boundaries that you have drawn on your map. They go on moving from
one place to another place. Sometimes they travel thousands of
miles.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few birds who live at the North Pole, but when it becomes
absolutely impossible to live there because of the cold, they start
moving towards warmer places. Three thousand miles they will travel –
and they don’t care about your nations. In a new place... for example,
they will travel and come to a warmer place, and when it it the time,
there is the season of mating. So they give birth to eggs, but they
don’t have enough time to take care of the eggs; three thousand miles
have taken so much time.</p><p><br></p><p>They have to go back, because now the climate at the North Pole is
again ready to welcome them. So they leave their eggs and fly three
thousand miles again. The eggs grow on their own, the children are born.
And it is something mysterious – science has not been able to figure it
out: there is no guide, there is no school to teach them, there is
nobody even to tell them where their parents have gone, but these
newly-born birds start moving towards the North Pole three thousand
miles away. Existence is really mysterious.</p><p>Nobody asks about them, when they cross the borders. Even if you ask,
they will not understand your language. And even if you try to keep them
out, it will be almost impossible. Man is not as free as birds, animals,
fish. What a degradation!</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, whenever I say anything, remember the whole context of it;
otherwise you will misunderstand me. I want one world, so that there is
no war and no need of soldiers. I want one world government. I want the
president of the world government only to be president for six months,
so that he cannot do any harm. And I want one person to be chosen only
once. These are all precautions.</p><p>Genetic engineering, to give birth to children in scientific labs,
will be in the hands of the scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>We have tried religion and it failed. We have tried politics and it
has failed. Now we have to try science. Give it a chance, because in
three hundred years it has made more progress than man has made in his
whole history of millions of years.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have proposed to you that the world should have one academy of
sciences, so there is no Russian scientist, no American scientist, no
Hindu scientist, no Christian scientist – all that is past. That academy
will have all the geniuses of the world. And all other efforts have
failed; science should be given a chance. There is no harm. At the most
it can fail – the worst possibility is that science also will fail – but
I don’t think it can fail.</p><p>We have to prepare a new kind of man. Out of that new kind of man –
meditative, silent, loving – will be coming scientists.</p><p>And I am not a pessimist; nor am I an optimist. I am very much a
realist. As I conceive it, all these things are possible. In fact,
without them life will become impossible. The choice is yours. Give
science a chance, and prepare the ground so that there are no
governments – only one government, which has no desire to fight because
there is nobody to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the politician’s character will change, because there will be no
political parties. People will be choosing individually, there will be
no political vested interest. Because of political parties the
politician is bound to be cunning, exploiting, doing all kinds of
things.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago they imprisoned the Reverend Moon, because all
the Christians were against him – he is a Christian, he comes from Korea
– and he was attracting young people. The churches were against him
because they were losing their sheep. And he is a perfect businessman,
he has industries in Korea; he is a great salesman. He has been selling
other things, but there is no better business than selling God. You
don’t have to produce, you don’t need any factory; you don’t have to do
anything. All that you need is to provoke people’s fear and greed. And
he was collecting enormous amounts of money.</p><p>All the Christian churches were against him, parents were against
him. They found a small flaw; that over three years’ time he has not
paid seven thousand dollars of taxes. He is jailed. He fought in many
courts, but finally the Supreme Court refused to consider the case.</p><p><br></p><p>The vice president of America has not paid fifty thousand dollars in
taxes – no punishment! The government simply said it was an “oversight.”
Fifty thousand dollars is an oversight – seven thousand dollars, and you
are in prison for eighteen months!</p><p>It amazes me. It is a beautiful thing to look around.… The same
churches who were against Reverend Moon – in fact, these churches forced
the tax department and the government: “This man should be punished. He
is putting the money given to the church into his own account.” Now he
is punished, and he is punished only because he is not an American.
Otherwise American law provides that if a man fails to pay two thousand
dollars per year he can be forgiven; he can be given a chance. There is
no need to punish him, he should just give the money to the tax
department.</p><p><br></p><p>Over three years’ time, seven thousand dollars is not much of a
crime. He should be given a chance to give the money – and he was ready
to. These churches forced the government, because they wanted him to be
punished, so that his congregation disperses. Now the same churches are
making an appeal; they have made a protest that his case should be
reconsidered.</p><p>I have seen the whole list. All kinds of churches, Christian
associations, have signed it. They are all religious organizations with
one exception: it has been signed by the state of Oregon also! That is
something really great. What has the state to do with it?</p><p><br></p><p>The State is fighting against us, saying that we are mixing state and
religion. In fact, there is no state here, no religion here, just
individuals, utterly independent, living together because they feel a
certain affinity. Just because of their experiences, they find it easier
to be with people who are peaceful, silent, meditative. It helps them
also in return to become more meditative. I call this the Buddhafield. A
certain energy is created by so many people, which can trigger anybody
into going i nwards.</p><p><br></p><p>The state of Oregon is in favor of Reverend Moon; it says that he
should not be punished. This is not in any way the concern of the state.
It means that the state does not believe the federal courts, does not
believe that those courts are fair. It is a contempt of the federal
courts to protest.</p><p>And why with all those churches? Is the state of Oregon a church? And
what authority have they got? We are also part of the state of Oregon.
We have not been asked – how can they sign it on our behalf? They should
have asked the whole state.</p><p><br></p><p>They did not protest when scientologists were punished, because they
were not Christians. Other religious groups have been punished, forced,
harassed; the state of Oregon has never signed a protest. And they are
protesting because the man is a Christian – one thing.</p><p>The second thing: Why are all these churches protesting? These were
the people who forced the government in every possible way, so that
Reverend Moon should be either imprisoned or deported. They are
protesting now because if Reverend Moon is a criminal by not giving
seven thousand dollars to the tax department, is a criminal because he
was putting the church money, corporate money, in the banks under his
own name... all these churches and their bishops are doing the same!</p><p><br></p><p>After this decision of the courts that Reverend Moon should be
punished, sent to jail, they must have freaked out, because they have
been doing the same thing on a larger scale. Bishops have bank accounts
through which church money moves. Seeing the possibility that this may
create a trouble for all the church leaders, now they are protesting on
behalf of the same man they were trying to have punished. Do you see the
cunningness?</p><p><br></p><p>And only Christian churches have signed it. No Jews have signed it,
no Mohammedans have signed it. And amongst those churches, the state of
Oregon looks simply odd. Is it a church? And they are saying to us that
we are mixing church and state! In fact, that’s what they are doing.
Because they are basically Christian, they don’t want some Christian
leader to be punished.</p><p>And a state trying to save someone who has committed a crime is
strange. The state government of Oregon seems to be a Christian state.
Their hostility to us has no other base except that we don’t belong to
any religion, that we have dropped all kinds of superstitions.</p><p>I have the whole vision of the New Man: No religions, no nations, no
governments – only one functional government, and a powerful world
academy of scientists. And science should be the decisive factor.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid. Scientists are not monsters, scientists are very
humane. And if meditation goes on flowering and sannyasins go on
growing, scientists will be the first people to be interested in the
inner journey. They need it; otherwise their lives are unbalanced. They
are only going out, out, out. They need certain methods so they can go
inwards and keep a certain balance. And a meditative scientist cannot
conceive of creating monsters, murderers.</p><p>Science has been a blessing to man. It can be a greater blessing if
there is only one world.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>32</span></p><p><br></p><p>God: the need of the old man</p><p><br></p><p>30 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MY MEMORY OF MY PARENTS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IS SO <span class=s10>ALIVE. MY</span> FATHER PAINTED AND WROTE <span class=s10>POETRY.  MY</span> MOTHER TAUGHT ME DANCING. BOTH OF THEM
WERE AGNOSTIC, AND NEVER TAUGHT ME RELIGION. NOW DIVORCED, THEY EACH
LIVE IN QUIET DESPERATION, UNWILLING TO TAKE CHANCES. FOR ME THEY HAVE
DIED AND ARE JUST SHELLS OF FEAR. THIS MAKES ME SAD, BECAUSE ONCE THEY
FLOWED WITH JUICE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a complicated question. In the first place, you do not know the
meaning of agnosticism. Just not to teach you religion is not
agnosticism. Just not to believe in religion is not agnosticism. If you
call it agnosticism, you will have to use the word “negative”; it is
negative agnosticism.</p><p><br></p><p>The positive agnostic is a seeker, and he goes on seeking, risking
everything to find the truth, the life.</p><p>It is so easy to be a negative agnostic; not much intelligence is
needed for that. All religions are so full of rubbish that any man of
average intelligence can see it. And seeing it, he becomes non-
religious. Your parents must have been of the same kind. Religions were
wrong – that was their intellectual standpoint. But they never tried to
fill the vacuum that religion was occupying. They threw the baby out
with the bath water.</p><p><br></p><p>To be an agnostic means tremendous search. You have not to believe,
and you have not to disbelieve either. The negative agnostic
disbelieves; and there is not much difference between belief and
disbelief. The religious person believes in God, the irreligious person
does not believe in God, but their beliefs and their disbeliefs are only
mental games. Neither of them has searched, meditated, gone deeper into
his own center. To be an agnostic needs tremendous courage, immense
energy and patience.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the agnostic comes to the center of his being, certainly he
finds there is no God, because the moment you know your center, you have
known the center of the whole existence. On the periphery we are
separate, but our separation is only at the circumference. As you go on
moving towards your own self, you are coming closer and closer to other
people’s selves. Ultimately when you reach to the center, you are
amazed: there is no God, but there is tremendous beauty, incalculable
silence.</p><p>If their agnosticism were what I am defining it to be, they would not
have been in desperation. The agnostic can never live in desperation.
Either he is involved in the great search of what it is all about He has
no energy for desperation, he is pouring his whole effort into one
single dimension:</p><p>he wants to know.</p><p>The agnostic is not the end of the search. It is just the
beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>The agnostic cannot say there is no God, there is no heaven, no hell.
That is what the atheist goes on doing. Perhaps your parents were
atheists. The atheists are bound to come someday to deep despair. As
death comes close by, they start trembling. They have not believed in
God, they have disbelieved in religion. It was good when they were
young, but before death almost all atheists become theists, they start
believing. A simple arithmetic.…</p><p>Death is there. What is beyond they don’t know. They don’t know
themselves. It was easier when they were young, hot. They enjoyed
criticizing, they enjoyed destroying arguments of those who believe. And
it is very easy to destroy their arguments. God is not an argument. At
the moment of death, as they become older and the gap between them and
death is becoming less and less, they freak out. Now they are no longer
young, no longer hot. They have become just cold, shrunken, and death
scares them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the only way is to accept religion, because religion is a kind of
opium. It helps you to forget your despair, your anguish. It helps you
to hallucinate whatsoever you want. And the reasoning is: “If there is
no God, there is no harm. By becoming a theist, if there is a God, then
we can say, ‘Forgive us, we were too young, inexperienced. Knowing
nothing, we started disbelieving in you.’” And all the religions teach
that God forgives those who ask for it.</p><p>It is simple. Whether he is or not, is not the question. The person
is going to die and has to face the reality – if he survives death, with
what face is he going to encounter God? This is the despair of your
parents. Young, they were painters and poets and dancers. It is easy,
when you are young, to do all kinds of foolishnesses. And when you do
not believe in the religion people all around you are believing in, you
have a certain satisfaction that you are unique, individual. You assert
your uniqueness. It is nothing but an ego number.</p><p><br></p><p>In youth, everybody thinks he is a great painter, a great poet, a
great musician. Youth is blind – it is just the energy of nature which
is overflowing in you. And you are not even concerned with death, it is
too far away. There is a certain limit beyond which you cannot be
worried. You can worry for tomorrow, you can worry for the day after
tomorrow, but are you going to worry about the coming year? Are you
going to be worried about the coming century? You will say, “Today is so
much, tomorrow is close by – who cares about the coming century?”</p><p><br></p><p>One person has asked, “Osho, is it not enough to be with You and
enjoy, rather than thinking of the</p><p>future of humanity?”</p><p><br></p><p>He himself is in doubt; otherwise from where does the question arise?
Who is telling you to be worried about the future of humanity? It is
enough if you can manage your life; the future will come out of it.
Tomorrow is going to be born out of today. Whatever you are doing today
will create your tomorrow. Once you know the secret, you are not only
enjoying here, you are also creating the future.</p><p>The way the question is asked it seems you must be worried about the
future of humanity. You want my approval: that it is perfectly okay,
don’t feel guilty, just enjoy this day with me. Your question does not
need an answer, your question needs approval.</p><p><br></p><p>But in youth, death is almost non-existential. You cannot disregard
it when you get older. Your parents must be getting older. Their youth
is finished, the love between your mother and father is finished – that
too was there because they were young. In old age everybody would like
to be divorced, not only from his wife, but from womankind as such.</p><p><br></p><p>Youth is the time of romance. That’s why young people have never been
taken seriously. The elders, the old people who have passed through all
experiences of life, have been respected throughout history. You will
not find a single civilization where the young man was respected – just
tolerated; he was only a nuisance and nothing else. But the old people
knew – they were also young once, they have also befooled themselves in
many ways: “There is nothing to worry about, these young people will
also get over their romantic ideas, ideas of revolution, of the future
of mankind.”</p><p><br></p><p>As death comes, you will shrink to a single question: What is beyond
death, what is going to happen? If there is a God, then I am doomed – my
whole life I denied him.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is no God, that too is scary. Then you will become a ghost,
without a body, a consciousness who wants things but cannot get them,
because things are material and the ghost is not material, he has no
material body. This is one possibility, which is not very appealing.</p><p><br></p><p>And ghosts have never been known to paint, or to compose poetry,
music. They have never been known to dance and enjoy. Ghosts don’t fall
in love, for the simple reason that the ghost has lost the body, the
biology, the physiology; he is just a shadow.</p><p>It is not appealing to become a ghost and wander around hungry for
all the things that he had desired in life. He would like to have a
woman, but in ghosts I have never heard that there is any sexual
difference. They are all alike. There is no beautiful ghost, and there
is no ugly ghost; there is no male ghost, there is no female ghost. And
they are stuck with all kinds of desires.</p><p><br></p><p>No, no old man would like to live like that; it is better to die
completely. Death should be total, not only of the body but of the soul
too. That will be a great relaxation, because if you are not, who is
going to worry?</p><p>Just think back: when you were not born, do you remember that you
were very much concerned about things – nuclear weapons, world war,
Ethiopia? And do you think that before your birth, when you were
non-existential, there was any problem? There was no problem. Not to be
is the end of all problems, all sufferings, all misery.</p><p><br></p><p>But if there is a God, the old man who has denied him all his life is
in despair. He cannot say now that God exists. It goes against his ego
which he has cultivated for seventy, eighty years. And now he cannot
stand up so strongly for his disbelief either.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my experience that any atheist I have come across is always
young. I have never come across an old man who is an atheist. It is a
similar case: you never come across an old man who is a hippie. To be a
hippie you need to be between twenty-five and thirty-five. For those ten
years you have strength to fight the society, to go against its
morality, to do things which are not allowed – to take drugs It is a
challenge.</p><p>But as you go on growing, nearabout between thirty-five and forty the
hippie disappears. Suddenly thousands of hippies simply disappear. Now
that youthful, romantic ideology of free love, drugs, not caring about
anything, is not possible. You are becoming older; you need a home, you
need a wife to look after you. You need children, because they will be,
in a subtle way, tremendously satisfying. You know that you will die,
but at least you will live in your child. The child is part of you. Even
if a part is saved, it gives consolation.</p><p><br></p><p>Your parents in your childhood were young, full of romantic ideas. In
fact, the young man wants to be recognized, his greatest need is
attention. If you are a theist, who is going to give you any attention?
There are millions of theists, it is a very common thing. But to be an
atheist – you immediately start getting attention. That fulfills the
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>And the trouble is that the atheist can always defeat any other kind
of believers. The atheist can win in argument with any theist, because
the theist has no evidence, no eyewitness about what happens after
death, because nobody comes back after death and tells you stories about
what is beyond death. So it is left up to your imagination. Of course,
older people start imagining a God; otherwise they will be so helpless
without the body – wandering like a cloud with no direction, no purpose.
They need God. God is the need of the old man.</p><p><br></p><p>Children don’t care; they are forced to believe in God. The old man
is again in a similar situation, but far more difficult and complex. A
child can easily be molded; he is soft, vulnerable, imitative. The old
man feels for seventy, eighty years he has been a certain kind of
person. His personality has become consolidated, and now at the moment
of death it is very difficult for him to undo himself. That is why the
old are in despair.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did they get divorced? As youth leaves you one day, it takes many
things from you; it does not go alone. It takes all your paintings, all
your poetries, all your music, all your dances. It takes all your love,
and leaves behind something utterly empty, dark, nobody to take care of.
Children must have</p><p><br></p><p>been grown up by now, they must be passing through revolutionary,
rebellious stages – perhaps</p><p>they may be hippies. They don’t care about you; you have lived your
life, they want to live their life.</p><p><br></p><p>They may be somewhere in Kabul, in Kulu Manali, in Kathmandu, in Goa
– they are enjoying their youthfulness and its freedom, and they have
energy to waste. They must be taking marijuana, hashish, opium, LSD.
They don’t care even if they are imprisoned – I have known many people
who have been imprisoned for using drugs which governments declare
illegal. But imprisonment does not help. Out of the prison, they are
again on the same track: Kabul, Kulu Manali, Kathmandu, Goa. Goa is
their destination. These are just stopping, resting places; Goa is the
final goal.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, just a little drifting All the Christian countries are
against marijuana, LSD, hashish, but</p><p>they are not against alcohol, which is far more dangerous to health.
Why? – because Jesus himself was a drunkard, his apostles were all
drinking. So alcohol has some religious significance for the
Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian community or the Christian country cannot prohibit it.
Prohibiting it, making it illegal, means you are raising questions
against Christ and his behavior, you are doubting the great twelve
apostles. And if Jesus can drink wine – not only that, if he changed
water into wine – how can you say wine is illegal? If wine is illegal,
then Christ was not doing a miracle but was committing a crime by
turning water into wine.</p><p>Christians accept alcohol – it is strange – and they deny LSD, for
the simple reason that LSD was not available to Jesus Christ. Otherwise,
I can say with certainty that Jesus Christ and all his apostles would
have been taking LSD and real grass. They had to confine themselves only
to alcohol; that was the only drug available.</p><p>You ask me what went wrong with your parents? Everything. First, they
got married. If they were not married, at least they would have saved
you from this life! And they were so much involved with painting,
poetry, dances I have never heard their name as a great painter, or as a
great poet, or as</p><p>a great dancer. But in youth the balloon of the ego is big. You write
a third-rate letter and you call it a love letter. Most probably you
have copied it from a third-rate novel, or from a movie.</p><p><br></p><p>You perform the act of love – it is some kind of exercise, it is not
love. Real love is possible only to the meditator, that is his reward. A
man who does not know himself, a woman who does not know herself – these
two ignorant people fall in love with each other, and out of this
ignorance you are born. And sooner or later, those two ignorant people
become fed up with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Now your parents are living separately, alone, in despair, in
desperation. What is their desperation? Now your father knows that his
paintings are just stupid, these same paintings that looked as if a new
Picasso is born. His poems look like rubbish. There is nothing in them,
he was just putting words together in a certain order. These poems are
created, composed, they have not been given birth.</p><p>The real poet gives birth to his poetry. He breathes it, his heart
beats in it. In the moment he is pouring forth his poetry, his music,
his dance, he is not there. If he is there, then the poetry and the
dance and the music will remain mediocre. One has to disappear, one has
to disappear in the act so totally that nothing is left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great poets, Coleridge, was asked by a professor, “I want
to come and see you, because I am in trouble. Your poetry I have to
teach to the students. There are a few lines, statements in your poetry,
which I find difficult to explain. And the students are asking me. I
feel embarrassed to say that I don’t know, and I am a D.Litt in
literature! I thought it better I come to you and ask the meaning of
those lines.”</p><p>Coleridge said, “You can come, but remember, I am also in great
difficulty.” The professor said, “About your poetry you are in
difficulty?”</p><p>He said, “Yes. When I wrote them, two persons knew the meaning of
what I was writing: God and I. Now only God knows! I cannot figure out
myself what the hell I have done.”</p><p>An authentic poet is not present, he gives way for the poetry to flow
from him. And the same is true about music and dance, sculpture and
architecture, about everything that is beautiful. If they come out of a
meditative state, then they are not ego products. Ego products are going
to be very ordinary.</p><p>Now, let me come back.</p><p>Why have your parents divorced? You are asking me what has gone
wrong. The romance is over. Romance is nothing permanent. It is just
like the wind: it comes, you feel the coolness, the breeze, and then it
is gone. It is like the flowers blossoming in the early morning sun – so
beautiful, so colorful, so magical that even dewdrops on their petals
look like pearls. But by the evening the petals are falling, the flower
is disappearing.</p><p>Romance is just a flower. It is not a coincidence that the hippies
and their type of people were called flower people. They will blossom
and they will disappear, there is no need to bother about them. It
happens, this disease, to every young person.</p><p>And if your mother was also a dancer, then certainly both were
artists. It happens more to the artistic people. They are against the
whole world, against everything, because they think they can create a
new world. The old poetry, the old paintings are nothing to them, and
their very ordinary painting is just the greatest piece of art.</p><p>In youth you can believe in anything. And when you can believe in
your creativity, poetry, music, it is easy to drop believing in God, in
religion, because you have found your own opium. You don’t need pope the
Polack to supply opium to you. You grow your marijuana in your own
garden; there is no need to get it from all kinds of peddlers. But one
day youth is going to disappear. And the day youth disappears, you have
entered into the arena of death. Old age is only a preparation for
death.</p><p>Now they must be feeling empty. Their art has failed, their love has
failed, their revolution has failed, but their ego is still there. The
ego cannot go against itself. If it has been atheist all its life, it
cannot become suddenly theist. That is the desperation. Otherwise, just
as youth has its opium, old age has its own opium: believe in God,
believe in Jesus Christ, believe in the messiah – he will save you, he
will take you into the kingdom of God.</p><p>Reverend Jim Jones managed to convince one thousand people that if
they died with him, he would take all of them into paradise. He went a
little farther than Jesus Christ. Jesus was saying, “At the time of
judgment, the final day of judgment, I will choose my sheep and take
them into paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Reverend Jim Jones is more progressive, more speedy, more American.
“Why wait for the day of judgment? I am going, come along with me.” And
all those people – most of them black, uneducated, uncultured, knowing
nothing about existence, its experiences – they had heard only this
fool, Reverend Jim Jones. They had followed him out of the country; then
finally they followed him out of life.</p><p>And it is a surprise that nobody criticized Christianity for it.
Nobody could see a simple connection: that what Jesus was saying, this
poor fellow, Reverend Jim Jones, was practicing, of course with more
modern techniques. The people who died in Jonestown, they were given
Kool-Aid to drink which was full of poison. Really contemporary! Jesus
cannot be thought to have known anything about Kool-Aid.</p><p><br></p><p>It was tasty, and death was not a fear because the leader, the
shepherd, was going with them, and he knew the way, he had a direct
communication line with God.</p><p>On the contrary, Christians criticize me; they say that I am creating
another Jonestown. They are responsible for Jonestown. They are
responsible for so much violence in the whole history that it would have
been a great blessing if the holy ghost had missed his target. The world
would have been in a better condition without Christians. It will be,
one day, in a better condition without all religions. In some way or
other, they are all suicidal. A few, like Reverend Jones and his
followers, do it quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainas in India have followed the same idea for the thousand years at
least: their monks fast unto death. It takes sometimes seventy days,
eighty days, ninety days. The man goes on becoming a skeleton. His eyes
go on deepening, becoming dark. He cannot move, he cannot speak. I don’t
think after seventy days’ fast he recognizes anybody, or even knows what
is happening, what he is doing. They have given it a beautiful name,
santhara, and they think this is the greatest ascetic practice. It is a
crime, but the Indian government cannot stop it: it is a religious crime
and you are not supposed to interfere in religion.</p><p>Your parents are feeling empty, trembling before death. All that was
meaningful is no longer there. They are simply hollow. It is right that
you say, for you they are dead. They are really living a ghostly life.
On the one hand, their whole past does not allow them to change their
minds. On the other hand, death, the darkening night. Death says it is
better to change your ideology; perhaps there is a God, who knows?</p><p>If they were real agnostics, by this time they would have found what
the truth is. The truth is godliness. Yes, there is no God, but there is
a quality so high, so pure, so innocent, so fragrant, that once you have
known it, you have known all that is worth knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a quality. That’s why I emphasize again and again that if you
meditate you will come to a space of godliness, but you won’t find an
old man with a long beard, sitting on a golden throne, saying to you,
“Hi! So at last you have come. How do you do?” No meditator in the whole
of history has found any person. Yes, every meditator has found a
tremendous experience of awakening, enlightenment, liberation.</p><p>Your parents need meditation, otherwise they will die in tremendous
despair and frustration. And meditation needs no belief system, so they
need not drop their belief systems. Meditation does not</p><p><br></p><p>require you to believe in God, heaven and hell. It requires nothing.
It simply gives you a method which you can work easily.</p><p>You say that they are afraid to take any chances. Of course, they had
lived with a certain disbelief for so long, and that disbelief and the
philosophy they had woven around it have failed. And there is not much
time left. Now to try anything new, naturally, they will feel afraid.
They tried one thing their whole life, and it failed. Their paintings
failed, their poetry failed, their philosophy failed, their music, their
dance – they are bankrupt, spiritually bankrupt.</p><p>If you love them, if you have any feeling for them... and you must
have, otherwise the question would not be raised. You may think they are
dead, but you know they are not dead; they are dying. Then it becomes a
responsibility for you.</p><p><br></p><p>At least they have done one favor to you – you have to accept the
obligation – they never taught you any religion. It is time to help
them. It is a great opportunity for paying back all the love that they
have given to you when they were young. Teach them how they can
meditate. And the way of meditation I am teaching you is very simple. If
they can just watch their minds – and we are not asking much – if they
can become just a witness, a watcher, the mind will slowly melt away as
ice melts when the sun rises.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the only medicine for them now. If they can die
meditatively, silently, blissfully – which is simple and possible – you
will feel also relieved of a burden; otherwise, you will carry some
burden on your soul, that you could not help them when they needed
it.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “They were so juicy – what has happened?” Everybody
is juicy when they are young, youth brings all your juices to their
peak. But youth is a fleeting phenomenon.</p><p>I have heard about three old men: one was seventy, another was
seventy-five, and the third was eighty-five. They were sitting in a park
– and that was their routine, every day they would come. They had no
work the whole day, so by the evening they would come and sit and talk
about the past.</p><p>The old man has no future, he has only a long past. The child has no
past, he has only a long future; hence children want to grow fast. Old
people cling to the past: perhaps that will help against the oncoming
death.</p><p><br></p><p>So they used to talk about beautiful moments in their life, difficult
times in their life, successful moments in their life – most of which
was exaggerated. It was their imagination that they were a great success
when they were young, that they were this and that.</p><p><br></p><p>This evening when they met, the first old man, seventy, said, “One
thing has been bothering me, and I would like to say it to you – it is
almost a confession – so that I am relieved of it. I cannot go to the
priest, he is just a young fellow – what does he know about religion?
You are older than me, you have lived more, known more. I would like to
confess to you.”</p><p>The other two became very excited. They said, “What is the thing that
is bothering you? Tell it, get rid of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very embarrassed, but he said, “The problem is that I was
caught red-handed peeping through the keyhole of the bathroom, because a
beautiful woman was the guest and I could not take myself away from the
keyhole. And my grandmother caught me red-handed. I am ashamed.”</p><p>The two old people started laughing. One said, “You are a fool!
Everybody does it, it is not a problem. In fact, why are keyholes made?
This is their purpose, and we all have done it, so don’t be worried. And
it is our experience, that from the keyhole of the bathroom, an
ordinary, homely woman also looks like Cleopatra, because you cannot see
exactly. It is vague. You can make it seem, through your imagination, as
if a fairy has descended in the bathroom. We all have done it,” those
two said, “you don’t be worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t understand me at all. It happened this
morning!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then they were a little shocked. This morning? At the age of
seventy?</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Naturally, it is understandable why you are feeling so
much in the dumps. But, boy, get out of it. What has happened has
happened. Next time, be careful. First watch about your grandmother,
whether she is around or not; all that is needed is that little
awareness. And find some excuse – drop your handkerchief on the floor.
The moment your grandmother comes, start looking for the handkerchief,
so you have an excuse: ‘The handkerchief had fallen and I was just
picking it up. I have nothing to do with the keyhole.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The seventy-year-old man was very happy. He said, “Great idea! I
never thought that some way I can manage an excuse to be there. This is
great! I am completely unburdened. Now I will really be waiting for
tomorrow morning. It will be difficult to sleep tonight. That woman is
really great!”</p><p><br></p><p>Because he had opened a certain subject, the second man said, “I also
have something to confess to</p><p>you. For almost five years I have been making love to my wife in a
special way.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “What special way? You should have told us. Don’t you
think we are your friends? You have found a special way, and you are
keeping us in the dark? Tell us! What is the special way?”</p><p>He said, “It is nothing much. Before going to sleep I hold her hand,
and press her hand two or three</p><p>times, and then we go to sleep.”</p><p>The other two said, “This is a way of making love?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What else to do? The trouble has arisen because once in a
while I forget to press her hand, and she immediately starts nagging me,
‘It seems you are pressing some other woman’s hand! I will not allow
this! You have to give an explanation. With whom are you making love
nowadays?’”</p><p><br></p><p>The third man said, “You both are idiots – you think these are
difficulties? I am eighty-five. I am feeling a real difficulty, and when
you know about my difficulty you will forget all this nonsense of
pressing hands, being nagged by the wife, becoming a Peeping Tom,
finding some excuse.…” He said, “I never thought that you are so
stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>“The real trouble is with me. This morning when I started preparing
to make love to my wife, she</p><p>said, ’Have you gone mad? – because two times in the night you have
done the same thing. And</p><p><br></p><p>it does not suit you – an eighty-five-year-old man making love three
times? You disturbed my sleep and I am fed up with you! I was hoping
that now that we are getting old, this animal game will finish. You are
getting older, and you are doing more and more the same thing that I was
thinking would be finished!’”</p><p>The two were really amazed. They said, “You think this is trouble?
This is great!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is a great trouble. In fact, my memory is failing – I
didn’t have any idea that I had made love two times, I was thinking this
is the first time. Your problems are nothing – my memory is just
disappearing!”</p><p>Your parents are old. They must be having many kinds of problems
which only old people have. Help them to meditate a little bit. Perhaps
they can get back the memory of those juicier days. Perhaps they can
start painting again, and now it will be far better. Perhaps they can
start music and dance, and now it will be better because it will be
coming out of their meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything changes its quality the moment the meditator touches it. I
say it to you on my own experience. I never quote the scriptures unless
something is my own experience. For these thirty- two years or more, I
have enjoyed food as I had never enjoyed before. Since enlightenment I
have enjoyed everything so profoundly, so deeply that I feel sorry for
the whole humanity. They also eat, but they go on doing many other
things in their mind while their mouth is chewing. Their mind is engaged
– how can they know the taste?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people eat too much. That’s why it is one of the biggest
problems in rich countries. Women are dieting, men are dieting, doing
exercises to make the body slim, because a fat man is declaring by his
fatness that he is empty and filling that emptiness with food.</p><p><br></p><p>After enlightenment, when you are eating you are simply eating. You
are not there, there is only a process of eating. Then it becomes
exactly like painting, when the painter is not there. It becomes like
dancing, when the dancer disappears in the dance.</p><p>I want to teach you that it is not only painters and dancers and
singers that have the prerogative to enjoy life. It is everybody’s
birthright – it has nothing to do with special talents. Cooking can be a
joy, cleaning the house can be a joy.</p><p><br></p><p>It is all the same. What you are doing is not the point; the doer
must be lost in doing, you should not remain separate. If you are
separate, then of course, there is going to be boredom. Every day
cleaning the house All housewives are bored, utterly bored. All men are
bored: the same job, the</p><p>same stupid customers, the same wife at home. To a meditator,
everything is beautiful.</p><p>He lives life in its abundance.</p><p><br></p><p>I say to you, only the enlightened person can live luxuriously.
Whether he has luxurious things around him or not does not matter. He
has some inner change. His vision, his attitude, his approach to things
is totally different from the average man or woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Help your parents. Pay the debt. And if you can see them again
painting, dancing, perhaps they may fall again in love. Perhaps they
will come closer to each other. My feeling is that people get divorced
only because they both become too much to each other. It becomes simply
impossible to live together, it becomes a constant harassment to
both.</p><p>If you can introduce meditation... and I am certain they will welcome
it, because they are in desperation. They need some help from somewhere.
And if you cannot do it for them, who is gong to do it for them? And
remember, meditation is not something that happens while you are young.
It is not something like love, romance, great ideas about
revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>I was also young, and while I was studying, I had many friends.
Somebody was a communist, somebody was a socialist, somebody was a
fanatic Christian, somebody was a Hindu chauvinist, and they all were
full of great ideas.</p><p>They used to ask me, “You don’t seem excited about the great problems
the world is facing.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You leave me alone. I am working in a totally different
dimension – you cannot understand it.</p><p>Be a communist!”</p><p>Now they all have disappeared in the crowd. Once in a while, if, by
accident I met somebody, I would</p><p>ask him, “What happened to your communism?”</p><p><br></p><p>He would say, “Forget all about it! My wife is pregnant, four
children I have already. Prices are going up, the rupee is shrinking
smaller and smaller, and I am just a clerk. There is no time for me to
think of communism. Those days are gone when I was trying to reach to
the moon.”</p><p>None of the students – and there were thousands of students in the
university – none, not a single one, has remained what he was in the
university. Perhaps I am the only one amongst that whole crowd of
socialists, communists, who has remained in the same dimension, going on
and on; I have found the way to infinity.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, enlightenment is not something that happens as an incident
and there comes a full stop, no. Enlightenment begins, but it never
ends. It is an ongoing process. It becomes juicier and juicier.</p><p><br></p><p>And when things go on becoming juicier and juicier, how are you going
to go back? Who remembers the way back, the past? – because every day
you are facing a new revelation, a new light, a new joy. Every day it is
so fresh that there is no need to look backwards.</p><p>The enlightened man is a child forever.</p><p><br></p><p>He has only the future, and there is no limit to his growth. Perhaps
even the sky has some limit, but enlightenment knows no limit.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THE NEWS MEDIA ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SIXTH OF AUGUST, THE
UNFORTUNATE DAY FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI WERE BOMBED
WITH THE FIRST ATOM BOMBS. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, GOVERNMENTS ARE STILL
SPENDING MOST OF THEIR MONEY MAKING THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CAN YOU
PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>The sixth of August can never be forgotten. That day we proved that
civilization has not happened to humanity yet, that we are barbarians,
that we are cannibals, that we are still animals. Darwin is wrong; the
whole idea of evolution is just imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of believing in Darwin, I believe in the monkeys, because
monkeys also have their idea: they think man has fallen – and certainly
he has fallen – from the trees. Falling from the height, you call that
evolution?</p><p>The sixth of August proved the monkeys are right, because to drop
atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the ugliest thing that man has
done in the whole of history. Everything else paled before it. And the
wonder of wonders is that it was not needed at all. Germany had already
surrendered; the Japanese forces were almost finished. Perhaps without
the dropping of the atom bombs the war may have continued one week
more.</p><p><br></p><p>That would not have been a great calamity – people had been fighting
for five years; for seven days more But that was the reason for dropping
the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, because if</p><p>the war ended then you would never be able to drop the atomic weapons
that you had. It was the time to make the world feel how much power and
strength you had. America wanted it to be remembered that if Nagasaki
and Hiroshima can disappear in smoke, then there is no problem: Moscow,
New Delhi, London, Paris – any place can be evaporated within
seconds.</p><p>American was trying to prove itself the greatest power in the world.
It had nothing to do with the war, they were winning. Now, dropping atom
bombs on people who are already losing every day – there cannot be any
other reason.</p><p>President Truman – and what a name he has got. Certainly he was a
true-man. We should change his name to President True-monkey; that’s
where he belongs. Even his military experts were not willing. They told
him, “It is absolutely unnecessary, the war has really ended. It is only
just a week’s work and Japan will surrender. Now that Germany has
surrendered, Japan cannot survive; the basic power was Germany. And we
are winning every day, so just wait seven days more. And if after seven
days the war is not finished, you can drop atom bombs.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he did not listen, because there was some other motivation in
dropping the atom bombs. It was not to win, they were winning already.
The motivation was to make it clear to the whole world that now America
is by far the biggest power. And just to prove this, two big cities,
throbbing with life, were just destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, Japan surrendered immediately; otherwise Tokyo would go
the same way as Hiroshima and Nagasaki had gone. And President
True-monkey told his military experts, “See? The war is finished
immediately. We don’t have to wait.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki are wounds which have not healed yet. And
rather than healing those wounds, America is piling up nuclear weapons.
Naturally, afraid of America, Russia is doing the same; they are piling
up nuclear weapons. In fact, it is now difficult to say who is more
powerful, because about American things are known, how much power
America has, but about Russia everything is secret. She may be more
powerful, she may have more nuclear weapons. She may have new methods
which are even superior.</p><p>For example, they have been trying, and perhaps they have succeeded,
in creating death rays. No bomb is needed, certain rays are just
directed towards the country. You will not see them, so you cannot
protect yourself. When somebody is bombing, there is time – Russia
cannot destroy the whole of America in a day, nor can America destroy
Russia in a day. But death rays will kill people and nobody will be able
to know what is happening. Suddenly the death ray hits your heart, you
fall dead. It is an invisible way of killing, and as far as I know,
there is as yet no way found to protect people against death rays.</p><p>And because these two biggest powers in the world are continuing to
create more and more destructive weapons, even small countries – just
out of fear, the whole humanity is living in fear – countries which are
starving, cannot manage even to survive, which perhaps will not be there
to see the third world war at all, they are also trying to make atomic
plants, nuclear plants. Their people are already dying and starving, and
they are preparing death for others, knowing perfectly well that now
there is no time to become in any way a great world power.</p><p>Russia and America are so far ahead that by the time you reach that
point, they would have moved again, miles further ahead. Now there is no
way for them to catch up. It is sheer stupidity on the part of other
countries to waste their money on nuclear weapons, for the simple reason
that they can never be the top power. That is impossible; they don’t
have the means, they don’t have the time.</p><p>And it is stupid for America and Russia too, because they have
already so much destructive energy in their hands that they can kill all
living beings on the earth, from trees to man – everything that
breathes. They both are ready enough to destroy life seven times over.
Can you see any intelligence in making more weapons? Are not these
enough? A man dies only once! And you are not the begotten son of God,
that after death you will be resurrected with glory, so they will have
to kill you again.</p><p>But I think the whole idea of resurrection of Jesus is a fiction.
Yes, I know he did not die on the cross. It was a Friday, and that was
chosen specially by Pontius Pilate. He was not a Jew, he had nothing
against Jesus. He was simply worried that a young man, only
thirty-three, innocent in every way – he has never committed any crime,
he has never harmed anybody – is being crucified. And Pontius Pilate
will be remembered always as the person who gave orders for the
crucifixion.</p><p>Judea was under the rule of the Romans and Pontius Pilate was the
Roman governor general of Judea. He tried in many ways to free Jesus;
first he tried to persuade the chief priest of the Jews, but they were
adamant. Then he tried.… Three people were being crucified: two were
criminals, murderers, and it was a custom that if the chief rabbi and
the people wanted, one person could be forgiven. Pontius Pilate was
hoping that the people would ask that Jesus be forgiven. He had not done
anything wrong. But people asked that Barabbas should be forgiven. He
was a confirmed criminal who had been to jail again and again many
times. They asked that Barabbas should be released. So that second idea
also failed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he tried a third method. On Friday Jesus was to be crucified.
Pontius Pilate managed to delay the process as long as possible. Jesus
was to be prosecuted and crucified in the morning, but Pontius Pilate
was able to postpone it a little bit more: he had to ask the emperor,
the message was coming, all the papers had to be filled in.</p><p>Jesus was crucified in the afternoon; this was a strategy – because
the Roman way of crucifying a man is really barbarous, utterly inhuman.
They nail the person’s hands on the cross, his feet on the cross; then
slowly blood starts oozing out. It takes at least forty-eight hours of
immense suffering for the man, and only then does he die.</p><p><br></p><p>Crucifixion is not an electric chair, where before you know you are
dead, you are dead – just a switch and you are finished. Even Adolf
Hitler was more human, although he killed millions of Jews; but he had
created gas chambers. People would go into the chamber, and within a
minute you would see smoke rising above the roof: the people were gone.
Thousands of people together, within a single minute, just
evaporated.</p><p>But to hang a person and keep him hanging for forty-eight hours at
least He will be hungry, he</p><p>will be thirsty – more so because blood is oozing out, there will be
dehydration.…</p><p>Pontius Pilate managed to crucify Jesus in the afternoon. It was a
custom of the Jews that on Saturday – that is their sabbath, their holy
day – all work should stop, everything should stop. On the day of
sabbath nothing is to be done. Pontius Pilate took advantage of this. He
said, “If it is so, then Jesus should be brought down” – he was still
alive, because blood was still oozing; when a man is dead, blood does
not come out of the body. “So he should be brought down, and after three
days, we will crucify him again.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was put in a cave with a big rock that single-handedly he could
not remove. And after three days, the cave was found empty. This was not
resurrection. This was Pontius Pilate and one of Jesus’ sympathizers who
managed the whole strategy. First, you bring him down – he is still
alive – put ointments on him, give him enough to drink, and then remove
his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus died in India in Kashmir. Naturally, those six hours on the
cross gave him a great lesson. And he had seen that there is no God, he
had seen that there is no miracle, he had seen that: “I was just crazy
proclaiming myself as the only begotten son of God.” In India he lived
really a long life – one hundred and twelve years, but in India he never
said again, “I am the messiah, the prophet.” Those six hours took away
all his fanatic ideas; those six hours brought him to his senses.</p><p><br></p><p>He was thirty-three when he was crucified. In India he lived to one
hundred and twelve years. He escaped Judea, because if he was in Judea
he would be crucified again. The experience of six hours on the cross
was enough. He did not want to do any more teaching, preaching. He did
not want anymore to be the savior. In fact, he saved himself, just in
time. He remained there with a small group of followers, but no promises
of the kingdom of God. He had promised that, and he had seen the
result.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the world does not know what happened to Jesus after
crucifixion. And Christians took the opportunity to claim that he was
resurrected, because the cave was found empty. But his grave exists in
Kashmir.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been to his grave, and it is an absolute proof, because on the
grave the writing is in Hebrew. Nobody knows Hebrew in India.
Mohammedans also make graves, but their graves always point towards
Mecca, their holy city. There are only two graves in India – one of
Moses and the other of Jesus – which are not pointing towards Mecca. And
on both the inscriptions are in Hebrew.</p><p>Of course, Jesus Christ is not named on that grave, because in Hebrew
his name was Joshua, not Jesus. Jesus is a Greek translation of Joshua.
And Christ is not used, because Christ is also a Greek word for messiah.
So on the grave you will not find the name of Jesus Christ, you will
find the name Joshua, the messiah. But that is the Hebrew name by which
he was known to his people.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki create a division in history. And now, to go
on piling up more and more weapons of destruction, just out of fear Even
India wants a nuclear plant. The difficulty is that one</p><p>of the most important things needed to make nuclear weapons is
uranium, and uranium is found only in Russia and America. So anybody who
wants to create a nuclear plant has to depend on these two powers.</p><p>America has bigger resources for uranium, so although India deep down
condemns America, it cannot declare openly that “We are not with
America,” because from where are they going to get the uranium? Russia
has only enough for itself; otherwise Russia would have provided the
uranium for India.</p><p><br></p><p>And the situation is absurd. When you have already enough to destroy
every man seven times, then stop everything! All the energy should move
to provide people with more comfort, more education, more health, more
medicine. And this is so simple.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on asking me, “Don’t you have any compassion for Ethiopia?
What are your people doing for Ethiopia?” I am not so unintelligent as
to send you to Ethiopia to serve the poor people there who are starving.
The crisis has been going on for four years, because for four years
there have been no rains. I don’t feel responsible at all for Ethiopia,
or India.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of people who are responsible, and on this sixth
of August, those two categories should take the responsibility to see
that things like Hiroshima and Nagasaki never happen again.</p><p>Who are these two categories? One is the politicians. They should
stop – not a semicolon, a full stop. No more money goes into making
destructive things, no money goes into the service of death. And you
should remember, seventy-five percent of the energy of all the nations
is going into the service of death. This seventy-five percent of the
energy should become available to the poor, the downtrodden. And can you
imagine? Seventy-five percent of the finances, if released from the
service of death, can make this earth a paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>This sixth of August.… The second category is that of priests of all
religions, who are teaching people that birth control is against God,
that abortion is a crime, is a sin. These are the people who are helping
the population grow faster and faster. These people should be behind
bars: the pope, his bishops, the shankaracharya, the imam, Mother Teresa
– certainly at least one woman should be included with these criminals.
They all should be in prison. Leaving them out is leaving ferocious
animals without chains in the society. They go on helping the population
to grow, and the population goes on creating more poverty.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not responsible. For thirty years I have been continuously
teaching that the pill is the greatest revolution after the discovery of
fire. Nothing else in between is of any importance. Birth control is
your birthright. It is up to you to decide, because there is no God who
is deciding. You have to take the responsibility upon yourself.</p><p>We are in our own ways trying to raise the consciousness around the
world to prevent the politicians from creating more destructive weapons.
And whatever nuclear energy, atomic energy, is available should be used
for creative purposes. The same energy can bring clouds over Ethiopia;
the same energy can stop floods in India. Energy is always neutral. It
depends on you for what purpose you are going to use it.</p><p>The politicians are responsible – and the religious leaders. I am not
responsible at all, because for thirty years I have been teaching in
favor of birth control, the pill and other methods. And I have been
teaching against atomic energy. But if people don’t listen then it is
their responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>If Ethiopia dies, it is not my responsibility; it is the
responsibility of Ethiopia itself. If India dies, it is not my
responsibility. They should hang their shankaracharyas who are
responsible for poverty in India. They should tell their politicians,
“We don’t need nuclear plants.” India is dying, half of India is
starving, and the wheat is being exported, because only by exporting
wheat and other things which their own people need, can India arrange
finances enough to make nuclear plants.</p><p>These politicians should be forced: “Either stop all efforts for war,
or get down from your seats. We</p><p>will find other presidents, other prime ministers.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth of August should be a day of declaration against the
politicians and the priests.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>33</span></p><p><br></p><p>You are my fellow travellers</p><p><br></p><p>3 1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER HAVE YOU SEEMED SO HUMAN, DANCING, LAUGHING AND CELEBRATING
WITH US. BUT NEVER HAVE YOU TOLD IT TO US QUITE SO STRAIGHT, WITHOUT
CATERING TO OUR UNENLIGHTENED MORTAL STUPIDITIES. IS THIS THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY VIBE?</p><p><br></p><p>You got it! This is the twenty-first century for me, and I am trying
to push you towards it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyasins should live ahead of time. The people who are burdened
with the past live five thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, and
they are stuck there.</p><p>You cannot live with the past. The past is dead, and to live with the
past is to be dead. The only life possible is in the present, and the
future is always changing into the present. It is always making the
twenty-first century in the twentieth century. The farther ahead you can
live in the moment, the more alive you will feel. And remember, it is
better to be red than dead!</p><p>I had to wait for you to behave humanly. I was waiting for my people,
because only they will understand that to be human is the highest value
there is.</p><p><br></p><p>I was talking to the Christians, to the Hindus, to the Mohammedans,
to the Jainas, to the Buddhists, and it was a difficult job. I could not
behave humanly with them. They wanted me to be their messiah, their
prophet, their messenger.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received two letters. One was from a woman in
California. She said, “I have loved you for many years. I have been
reading all your books – how beautiful it was when you spoke on Jesus!
And now after three years of silence, what you are saying has enraged me
so much that I have burned all your books. I will pray to Jesus Christ
and God to forgive you. Perhaps you should go into silence again. And if
you don’t go into silence, then there is only one possibility for you to
be saved: that is, when you expire the silence will descend on your
grave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this woman had all my literature, had loved me, she thinks. But
do you think she loved me? She loved Jesus Christ, and because I had
spoken on Jesus Christ, putting myself behind him. putting my gun on his
shoulder, she was happy, immensely happy and grateful. The poor woman is
not aware of the fact that she had never been in tune with me. Because I
was speaking on Jesus as no one had spoken before, I was supporting her
mind, her tradition, and she was feeling immensely happy. I was
fulfilling her ego.</p><p>Now she is so against me, she has burned all the books, and she is
praying to Jesus Christ, the God, to forgive me. She should also burn
the house in which my books have been. They have already infected the
air and the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel that you are supported in some way, you are happy.
Hindus were happy, Mohammedans were happy, Christians were happy –
everybody was happy. And I am not here to make you happy.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be blissful. I want you to know yourself, to know this
vast existence. And you cannot know it being a Christian or a Hindu.
Your eyes are covered with layers of dust that centuries have poured
over you.</p><p>Now she is feeling very offended, but still she cannot see the point.
I had to speak on Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, and hundreds of other
prophets, messiahs, saviors. But that speaking was very difficult for
me, it broke my back, because I was doing something which was against my
own nature. I was sorting out sentences from Jesus; those which I could
not support I never mentioned. Those which I could support, I supported
them with all the growth of the twenty centuries after him.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally many Christians, priests, bishops, were influenced. They
could not believe that a man who is not a Christian has such great
insight into Jesus, his words, his implications. It was not like that. I
was using Jesus only to catch fish in the big ocean of Christianity; I
have done that with all the religions. And then for three years I became
silent, just to know how many people were hanging around my words
because they supported their belief system.</p><p>In my silence this woman was happy. She said, “While you were silent,
I loved you. Since you have started speaking again you have destroyed my
love.” So those who were here for their own ego fulfillment.… And the
ego cannot be fulfilled by my silence; the ego need words, theologies,
philosophy. She wants me to become silent again. She is furious. She
wants me to be dead, but to be silent.</p><p><br></p><p>So in these three years I have sorted out my people, who can be with
my silence. That means it does not matter to them whether I speak or
not. It does not matter to them whether I say something which is against
their conditioning or favoring their conditioning. They love me, not my
words. Their communion is heart to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I saw all the camels have moved towards Santa Fe – Santa Fe
has become a great camel camp – I thought that the moment has come to
speak directly to you. And now I will be speaking directly to you.</p><p>There will be no Jesus between me and you, no Buddha between me and
you, just a pure communion. Only then can I reach to your heart;
otherwise, I can reach only to your mind – and mind has no function in
bringing you blissfulness, ecstasy, enlightenment. Mind can give you
better technology, but it cannot give you the New Man.</p><p>I feel sorry for the woman, but she should understand that it is all
her doing. I don’t know her even, she is not a sannyasin. And her love
was false; she was still a Christian, and she was being supported by my
meanings that I had put through Jesus’ mouth.</p><p>I know I have been doing a very risky job. If ever Jesus, Buddha,
Mahavira meet me, they are all going to attack me and kill me. They will
forget all their messages of love, their messages of peace. And it will
not be only Mohammed, it will be all those whom I have used. But there
is no possibility of meeting these guys again.</p><p>Now I can be human to you. I always wanted to be an authentic human
being. There was never a desire to be a prophet, a messiah, an avatar, a
godman. To me, all these words are four-letter words. I wanted just to
be simple, ordinary – the way I am. I wanted to expose my heart to you
without thinking what is going to be the consequence. This was possible
only when I had found my own people, who can understand.</p><p>You are fortunate that you have remained. All the sannyasins around
the earth are fortunate, because what they have listened to before was
not the truth. I tried hard to put the truth... I interpreted those
people, who were just crackpots – but it was compulsory. In this vast
world, it is very difficult to find your own people. They are already
belonging to some group, some theology, some religion. They have their
own church, their own mosque, their own temple, and they have great
investments there. They are hoping to attain paradise; they are afraid
of falling into hell.</p><p>We are not interested in heaven and hell or God. There is no need to
go to hell to experience it – you can just go driving on the county road
and you will know what kind of roads exist in hell. You need not travel
long to heaven – you can be just here, dancing, singing, rejoicing, and
you know heaven has come to you.</p><p>I emphasize the fact that nobody ever goes to heaven or hell. It is
just vice versa: Hell comes to you, heaven comes to you. It is your
doing, it is your heart that attracts it.</p><p>Hell is your misery, your suffering. Heaven is your rejoicing.</p><p>I have also received another letter, one from a Zen master who wants
to come and see me. And you will see the difference between a Christian,
Mohammedan, Hindu, and a Zen monk.</p><p>The Zen monks have emphasized that they do not belong to Buddhism. In
fact, Zen is a revolt against Buddhism. Buddha would not approve of
these people, they are too human. They are so simple: chopping wood,
drawing water from the well – you cannot conceive Buddha doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>This Zen master gives you a totally different vision. He is happy
that I am here. He is immensely rejoiced that somebody is here who can
even prevent the third world war. He just wants to sit by my side, to
feel the vibe. He also knows what I am saying. He is also reading my
books and he had read my old books too. But now he has decided that the
time has come, that he should come here, because now I am speaking on my
own authority. Now it is worth being close to a man who is not a
commentator, but is an enlightened soul.</p><p><br></p><p>He says in his letter that Buddha had declared that he would be
coming again after five thousand years. Twenty-five centuries have
passed. The Zen monk declares, “We are exactly in the middle:
twenty-five centuries back there was a Buddha, and perhaps twenty-five
centuries ahead there will be a Buddha. And you seem to be the bridge,
just exactly in the middle – twenty-five centuries.” He says he has not
seen Buddha, but he would like to meet me, to have some taste of
buddhahood, awakenedness.</p><p>This man has a totally different approach. He is a man of
understanding, meditation. If he ever wants to burn, he will burn the
old books and save the new ones, because the old books were
commentaries, which I had to make under compulsion. Now it is no longer
a commentary, I am telling you my experience. If Jesus or Buddha or
Zarathustra agrees with me, good; if they don’t agree, they can go to
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all pretended to be higher than you, holier than you, more
special than you. They fulfilled a great need in you: you wanted to
follow somebody who was the only begotten son of God. By following the
son of God you were also participating in something divine. I have
dissolved the very idea of following. You are my fellow travelers.</p><p><br></p><p>I want it to be declared throughout the earth, to all the corners of
the earth, that someone has transcended, for the first time, even the
experience of enlightenment – because that too is a way of creating
distance, great distance: I am enlightened, you are not enlightened; I
am always right, you are always wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>You are right as much as I am right. Accept the responsibility of
your actions, of your thoughts, of your being, and fight every kind of
trespass. You have to be yourself. If you cannot accept me being as
human as you are just because I am enlightened, then I throw that
enlightenment away. But I cannot allow you to be humiliated in a subtle
way; I cannot allow you to go on becoming bigger egos. To hell with
enlightenment!</p><p>And I will do everything that will destroy it. No Buddha has laughed.
What kind of miserable creatures...? No Buddha has danced. No Buddha has
sung.</p><p>You just wait! You will be the first ones to see a buddha dancing. As
your laughter and your love are making me stronger, soon I am going to
dance. You should not be surprised when someday I appear in your disco
or your playing cards room! I want to erase all kinds of stupidities
that have arisen in the past, and have become bigger and bigger as time
has passed.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins and I are not different. Your faults are my faults,
your errors are my errors. I accept you as you are; remember it, because
if I come to your disco perhaps you will not be ready to accept me. I am
preparing you for that, I don’t want you freaking out. It has been a
long and hard struggle for me to find my people, I am not going in any
way to freak them out.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly you will get accustomed to the idea that an
enlightened man can come to a disco, dance with you, play cards with
you, drink a little champagne with you. You should be immensely happy
that you are with a man who claims no holier-than-thou attitude. It is
ugly. There is nobody above human beings.</p><p>I have always loved one statement of Chandidas. He was thought to be
mad, because he declared: sabar uppe manu sut, tahar uppe nain – “Above
all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although he was in the past, I can recognize him as belonging to us,
he is a contemporary. And he is courageous enough to enter the
twenty-first century with us. What a great statement! SABAR UPPE MANU
SUT... “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”
He dissolved all gods, all angles. He recognized that man’s
consciousness is the highest.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t see it because you are asleep, but there is not much
difference between the man who is asleep and the man who is awake. The
man who is awake was asleep just few moments ago, the man who is asleep
may be awakened just in a few moments, but there is no basic
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to accept me as an ordinary human being. I don’t
want to be a leader, I don’t want</p><p>you to be led. I simply want to dance amongst you, completely
lost.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not be afraid of me. All the followers of Jesus Christ were
afraid of him, Buddha’s followers were afraid of him – because these
people have been continuously nagging their disciples. I think if
Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Krishna had been housewives,
the world would have been far better. They would have nagged only one
man, not the whole of humanity. I hate nagging!</p><p><br></p><p>When I was a child and lived in a very small village where no train
passes, no buses reach, my grandfather had a beautiful white horse. I
used that white horse for roaming around the town, going along the
river, going around the big lake. Slowly, slowly the horse started
feeling some synchronicity with me. He started feeling when I wanted to
return. But I never nagged even that horse. If he wanted to go north, I
said, “Okay.” If he wanted to go around the lake, I said, “Okay, you
decide, but I am not going to nag you against your wishes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was a strange thing, that he always went to the place where I
wanted to go. Between his consciousness and mine, something must have
been transpiring. There was a communion without words. And if a horse
can go to the place where I want, without my nagging and forcing him to
go there, certainly... even if I am amongst you, don’t be afraid. All
that is needed is not a superman to lead you, but a man with whom you
can have a synchronicity. A subtle vibe of love joins you and me, and it
will do miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been receiving letters from sannyasins: “It feels tremendously
beautiful to see you as a human being just like us, but still somewhere
I want you to be extraordinary, not ordinary. I want you to be higher
than your disciples.” Why?</p><p>My being higher simply makes it difficult to communicate. That’s why
all these people have failed. Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Confucius, Lao Tzu
– they all have failed, for a simple reason: they were there sitting on
the clouds, and you were crawling on the earth. What communication is
possible?</p><p><br></p><p>They maintained the distance; it was the fulfillment of their egos.
And you stupidly wanted your prophet’s cloud to be higher than those of
other prophets. But do you know what it means? It means your
communication with your leader, prophet, messiah, is even more
difficult.</p><p>All the religions have been trying to prove they are higher.
Buddhists say, “Buddha is higher than Jesus, than Moses, then Mahavira.”
And the other people are doing the same. I am starting a new history as
far as enlightenment is concerned. The closer I am to you, holding your
hand and dancing, the more is the possibility of communication.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to wake you, because I am so close to you. If I can dance
with you, you cannot remain asleep long; it is risky for you and your
sleep! If I can drink a little champagne with you, then our hearts can
melt into each other.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not look above to God the father, who is always above the
roofs – I don’t know what he is doing there! You can see me, look into
my eyes, because I am standing on the same ground as you are. There is
no distance, only a little difference – so little that I don’t care much
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be awakened. When I am so close to you, it is impossible for
you to go on sleeping. I can shake you, I can hit you – I am so close. I
can throw cold water in your eyes – I am so close. Buddha cannot do it;
he is sitting on a white cloud far away.</p><p>But that has been the conspiracy between the masters and the
disciples. The disciple really loves the master to be far away. That
gives him a satisfaction: “I am no ordinary man’s follower, I follow an
extraordinary master. Naturally, I am an extraordinary disciple.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are with me, a man who says that he is an ordinary human
being, I am destroying your ego. You cannot be an extraordinary
disciple, you have to be ordinary. If your master himself is ordinary,
what can you do? You have to be ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is my basic experience, that to be ordinary is the most
beautiful thing in existence. To be ordinary means to be relaxed. There
is nowhere to go, nothing has to be found; you have it already. It was
your ego that was blocking the way. Now the ego has disappeared, and you
can see to your innermost being, crystal clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing it, you are going to laugh – what a joke life has played upon
you! Life has put the kohinoor inside you, and given you the desire to
search for the kohinoor. And you are running all over the world – to the
churches, to the synagogues, to the monasteries, and doing all kinds of
stupidities to find that which you have never lost, to find that which
even if you want to lose, you cannot. It is your very being.</p><p>I have heard about a man who was walking in the desert all alone...
desert as far as he could see. It was his own shoes making noise – that
was the only noise – but it appeared as if somebody was following him.
It takes a little time; sound travels six hundred miles per hour, so
when your shoe makes some sound you don’t hear it instantly, there is a
gap. By the time you hear it your shoe has moved.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a logical, philosophic man. Certainly it was not the sound of
his shoes; somebody was following him. He looked behind, saw his own
shadow and figured out that this shadow seemed to</p><p><br></p><p>be some kind of ghost, because shadows are not known to make noise.
He started running and the sound became louder. He looked back – the
shadow was also running faster. He said, “My God! It means I am not
running fast enough!”</p><p>He did his best, till he was almost spent and fell under a tree near
an oasis. Now he was even more afraid, but he looked around: there was
no noise, and the shadow was not there, for the simple reason that he
was under the shadow of the tree. His shadow was so clear-cut under the
sun on the sand, and here, when he was sitting under the tree, the
shadow had left. He laughed. He understood that he had been making the
noise himself, and the faster he ran, the louder the noise became – and
it was his own shadow.</p><p>The moment you become enlightened, the first thing will be a mad
laughter – that this is the thing you have been searching for for many
lives, and you had it always in your pocket! All that is needed is just
a little shaking. And I have found many ways to shaking you, to help
you</p><p><br></p><p>open your eyes. And it is not a difficult job, in fact it is a great
joy.</p><p>Try with some sleeping man just brushing his cheeks with a toothbrush
slowly, and see what happens to him – how he tries to throw it away.
Just tickle his feet, and he pulls up his leg. Just start playing with
his belly, and he is bound to open his eyes – how long can he keep them
shut? How long can he remain asleep? What is going on? And he will also
join in your laughter.</p><p>I want you to live abundantly, with great laughter, rejoicing, and
the only possibility is if your ego is destroyed. And the best way I
have found is that I should be amongst you, not leading you, so that you
forget completely that you are followers of a great master. I am
perfectly ready to be your follower: you can walk ahead and I can follow
you and do all kinds of tricks from the back – which is easier!</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A LONG TIME AGO I REPLACED THE WORD GOD WITH SIMPLY “IT.” IT IS ABOUT
AS VAST AS I CAN GO WITH MY MIND. DO I NEED TO ABOLISH IT AS WELL? –
BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE AND ALL AROUND ME.</p><p>The first thing to be understood is that changing names does not
change anything. You can call it God, you can call it Allah, you can
call it Ishwar – there are three hundred languages on the earth. There
are three hundred ways to call God, or you can invent your own private
name for God.</p><p>You say, “I have replaced God with the word ’It.” What does it mean?
You have only changed the label. Perhaps you can change even the
container, but the question is of the content. And the content is there,
I can see from your question, because you say, “it is alive and all
around me.” Now, “it” is used for things. You have changed just the
word; you are giving him a new name, but “It” is all alike.</p><p>And the second thing you say is, “This is as far as my mind can go.”
That’s true. Mind can play with words, that’s as far as it can go. It
can never attain to the state of wordlessness. Your “It” will dominate
you, will keep you in slavery just as God has done for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing... you ask me, “Should I drop ‘It’ also?” No,
because then you will replace it by</p><p>another word.</p><p><br></p><p>The women’s liberation movement uses for God, “She.” And I think it
is a better word than “he”, because in “she,” “he” is present, but in
“he”, the “she” is absent. “She” is a bigger word. It is symbolic: in
“woman” the man is there, but in the word “man,” the woman is not there.
But basically it does not make any difference – you can call God “she.”
So I will not tell you to drop calling God “It.” It is not going to help
in any way.</p><p>I would like you to drop the mind which is playing this game of
changing one word for another. Drop the mind! Nothing else can help.
Forget about God. You don’t know him, you have not met him – how can you
change his name, his address?</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to trespass the boundary. You cannot take it into your
own hands, how God should be called. You don’t know anything about God,
and you will never know, because God does not exist at all. So you are
changing the name of something non-existential.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are so good at dropping from “he” to “It”, if you can even
drop God from “he” to “It”<span class=s6></span>he</p><p>stands for something, someone alive. It is used for things. If you
can do such a great job, pulling down God from his golden throne, and
making him a commodity in the market, then you can do a far easier
thing: drop the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a mind game, and the mind can play thousands of games. You
reduce God to It, but from the back door the “It” becomes alive all
around you. So what is the point? God is back. And it will give you
great ego satisfaction that you managed something of immense importance:
you have changed the name of God. It is not going to help. Your question
is simply indicative of it. God has come from the back door, and is
alive all around you.</p><p>Drop the mind. That is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation we don’t change the names of God. We don’t allow
ourselves in meditation to be identified with the mind. We are the
witness, and all games the mind plays are in front of the witness. The
witness is separate from all games.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be a Christian; then, fed up with being a Christian, for a
few years you can become a Hindu</p><p>– “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama<span class=s6></span>” – anything new
gives a certain excitement. But soon Hare Krishna or Hare Rama is found
in scientology – and you will not find him there long. If you go on
following these people, perhaps now he is in EST. By the time you reach
EST, the seeker has moved to Esalen. He will elude you, unless by some
accident he ends up here. From here there is no way out.</p><p><br></p><p>We open the doors of inwardness, and the method is: just be watchful
of your mind, how it fabricates philosophies, theologies, religions.
Just watch. I am not telling you to do anything. In the beginning it is
difficult, because you have never watched your mind. You have always
thought you are the mind, you have always remained identified with the
mind. So in the beginning it is going to be a little difficult, but it
is not impossible. In fact, what you have done – identifying yourself
with the mind – is something of the impossible. You have even managed
that!</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying to you is simple, natural, possible. You are not the
mind. And when mind stops, who is going to change the name of God? And
who cares? When the mind is silent, not even a ripple of thought, that
serenity, that silence will give you the first taste of godliness – not
of God, because to taste God will reduce you to a cannibal.</p><p>Please, don’t try to eat God! But religions have been telling you to.
Jesus, before departing from his company of fools, said to them, “Eat
me, drink me.” Don’t do anything like that with me. I am an ordinary
man, please – if you start eating me and drinking me, I will be finished
soon. I will not last even one day.</p><p><br></p><p>The taste is not of God, but of godliness. That too, you simply
experience and feel.</p><p>It is a quality, a quality that makes you aware of your immortality,
that makes you aware of the infinity of existence, that makes you aware
of utter beauty, grace, peace, blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is no person like God. There is nobody, there is pure
emptiness. And only pure emptiness or nothingness is what I have been
calling enlightenment.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SAID RECENTLY THAT WOMEN’S LIBERATION WOULD BE MEN’S LIBERATION
ALSO. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MEN’S LIBERATION?</p><p>This is one of the fundamental laws of life, that if you make anybody
a slave, in return, unknowingly, you become a slave to your slave.
Slavery is a double-edged sword. You cannot simply remain the master and
the other a slave. You start becoming dependent on the slave. And to
make somebody a slave is to create troubles for yourself, because the
slave cannot love you, cannot respect you.</p><p><br></p><p>The slave will always hate you, the slave would like to kill you. He
may not be able to, but these will be the thoughts moving around him. He
may be bowing down to you, but deep in his heart he wants to destroy
you, because freedom is an intrinsic necessity of every human being.
Nobody can like slavery. One can pretend, just to save one’s neck, but
one goes on gathering fire against the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was crucified... one never thinks about Judas – there are so
many implications in it. Why did he sell Jesus for thirty pieces of
silver? Certainly he was more valuable a man – crazy, but beautiful;
harmless, but with a charismatic personality. A little bit off his head,
but that is not a crime. And Judas had been with him for years as a
disciple. Why did he betray him?</p><p><br></p><p>My understanding is that being a disciple is a kind of slavery, and
there is a limit to how long one can tolerate it. And it is not only
with Jesus that it has happened; otherwise, it would be just an
exception, not the rule. But it is the rule, not the exception.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira’s own son-in-law tried to kill him. He had taken initiation
and become a disciple. He was hoping that because he was the son-in-law
And Mahavira had only one daughter; she was also</p><p><br></p><p>initiated, they both were disciples. You can imagine, it is simple,
that the son-in-law was hoping that Mahavira would declare him his
successor. And when Mahavira declared that Gautam Gantha – a far more
intelligent person – was going to be his successor, the son-in-law tried
to kill him. And the son- in-law revolted against Mahavira, taking five
hundred other disciples with him.</p><p>Now, these five hundred disciples had also been with Mahavira for
years. What was boiling within them, that rather than remaining with
Mahavira they went with an idiot who had nothing to offer? And they all
disappeared, evaporated, because he had nothing to offer. But they also
must have been angry at the slavery that Mahavira was imposing on
them.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jainism, things are really very strict. It is the most ascetic
religion in the world. The Jaina monk has to remain naked in all the
seasons around the year. It is difficult. The Jaina monk has to eat only
one meal, begging. The Jaina monk cannot drink water in the night – even
in the hot summers of Bihar where Mahavira was. As the sun sets, the
Jaina monk cannot take anything in his mouth, not even water.</p><p>The Jaina monk, naked, with one meal a day, has to walk on hot days,
on cold days, without any shoes – a naked man in shoes will look
awkward. I have seen Jaina monks and nuns – their feet show the story of
their asceticism: in the hot summer days they start bleeding,
cracking.</p><p><br></p><p>These people who have had all these disciplines imposed on them are
boiling within. They are following Mahavira because he is giving them
the promise of moksha. You will be surprised that moksha is higher than
what you know as paradise. So in Jainism there are three things: hell,
the lowest; heaven, in the middle; and moksha, the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>From heaven you are going to fall back again into life. It is a kind
of spiritual holiday, a holiday place on a beautiful beach. You earn
virtue – that is a bank balance of good deeds. When you have enough bank
balance, you are born in heaven. But no bank balance can last forever;
once your bank balance is finished you are thrown back to the earth
again to be human beings.Moksha is liberation forever.</p><p>These poor people who had gathered around Mahavira were torturing
themselves in every possible way, because this life is not long enough.
So much time has passed... somebody is fifty; perhaps twenty years more,
and then the eternal moksha, blissfulness forever, freedom forever.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the one hand they were doing all the austerities. But when you
torture yourself, you cannot love the man really who has somehow
manipulated you to torture yourself. When in the hot night you start
feeling thirsty, you will curse this man – silently, of course. Even if
you are sick, you cannot take medicine, because that is materialistic.
You want to live in the body – that is materialistic. So if the body is
falling apart, so far so good: the sooner you reach moksha.</p><p>But one thing is certain and simple, that these people will be
gathering anger against the so-called tirthankara, Mahavira. So when his
son-in-law left the fold, five hundred followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the case with Gautam Buddha. His own cousin-brother had
taken initiation. The same mind, the same ego.… He was older than
Buddha, he had renounced his own kingdom – he had had his own kingdom.
He was hoping that he was going to be the successor. But slowly,
slowly</p><p><br></p><p>he became aware that there were people like Sariputta, Mahakashyap,
Moggalayan, who were very intimate with Gautam Buddha; there was not
much chance for him. And he was not even worthy!</p><p>He left Gautam Buddha, and he also was followed by hundreds of monks.
And this man tried in every way to kill Gautam Buddha. When Buddha was
meditating one day under a tree in the valley by the side of a mountain,
the cousin rolled a huge rock at him. The story is that the rock, seeing
Buddha there, changed her route; Buddha was saved.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think that rocks can change routes – what is more possible is
that Buddha’s cousin-brother missed the target. And it is difficult to
calculate If from the high top of a mountain you roll a rock,</p><p>the target will not be necessarily hit, because the rock will come
against other rocks, trees, and will be going this way and that way
until it reaches the valley. So I don’t think that the rock was very
compassionate.</p><p>Buddha’s cousin used a mad elephant who was always kept in chains
because he was very dangerous, he used to kill people. He brought the
elephant near Gautam Buddha when he was sitting with closed eyes, and
released the elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is – but it is just a story – that the elephant, who was
mad, came rushing, roaring towards Buddha. But as he saw Gautam Buddha
he knelt down and touched Buddha’s feet. I don’t think that elephants
are wiser than man. If the cousin-brother is not changed, what
possibility is there for a mad elephant to change? Perhaps it was just
out of his madness that he was doing it. You can expect from mad people
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The mad elephant may have seen so many people bowing down before
Buddha and touching his feet. His screws were loose, but it is a
well-known fact that elephants are very imitative. That’s why they are
used in circuses; they learn to imitate very easily. You will not have
seen camels in the circuses, for the simple reason that camels are just
idiots. Elephants are imitative. So if this mad elephant did it, it
simply shows imitation. He had seen so many people every day doing it to
Buddha. He was mad enough not to bother about the cousin-brother who had
released him – and he was not aware of the purpose either.</p><p>What I am pointing at is that the moment you claim to be higher,
stronger, better in comparison to someone else, you are creating an
enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Man for centuries has been repressing the woman. Calling her the
weaker sex, which is absolutely wrong: man is the weaker sex. But he has
deprived the woman of education, deprived the woman of any financial
independence, deprived the woman of the right to move in society freely,
just as he moves. The woman is carrying immense anger accumulated for
centuries, and she takes revenge in her own way. She nags the husband,
she screams at him, she throws pillows at him. She turns the husband
into a henpecked husband.</p><p><br></p><p>Slavery is always mutual. Freedom is always mutual.</p><p>So I don’t make any distinction between women’s liberation and men’s
liberation. These are two sides of the same coin. If the woman is
liberated, man’s liberation follows automatically. If man</p><p><br></p><p>wants not to be nagged, not to be screamed at, not to be a target of
all kinds of things that the woman throws at him And this is an everyday
scene in every family.</p><p>The man has reduced the woman to a slave; the woman has her own ways
to reduce him to a slave. If you see a couple walking on the road, you
can decide without asking them whether they are married or not, whether
the woman is a wife or a girlfriend. With the girlfriend the man is so
happy – you can see it. With the wife he is so bored, so utterly sad,
for the simple reason that this woman has made his life a hell. But who
is responsible?</p><p>First, you have made her a slave, now she is returning it to you in
the same coins. Of course, the feminine way of taking revenge is
different – her psychology is different. But no woman gives freedom to
the husband. She keeps an eye on him – with whom he is talking, where he
is going. She goes on looking at his coat to see if there is any woman’s
hair on it. She goes on looking into his diary for phone numbers, and
through phone numbers she easily can figure out with whom he is
flirting.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an ugly relationship. Marriage is madness, because both are
trying to overpower each other. The women can never forgive the man for
what he has done to her: deprived her of education, deprived her of
financial freedom, deprived her of her human dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>So if the woman has liberation, man automatically becomes liberated.
There is no need for a man’s liberation movement, one movement is
enough. That will help the man immensely. His joy will come back, he
will be again chasing women, and that is the greatest game in the world.
The poor man has to play tennis, football, volleyball, hockey – but
nothing is a substitute! Chasing a woman is simply the most beautiful
game.</p><p>Once marriage is dissolved completely and people are free to be with
whomsoever they want to be – no barrier, no legality, no government, no
society interfering – you will see this whole world smiling, happier,
healthier, because you cannot get nourishment when you are in a state of
slavery. Although you go on proclaiming to the world that you are the
master of the house, you know perfectly well the moment you enter the
house who is the master and who is the mistress. Certainly you are not
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>This creates a strange split in you, it makes you a hypocrite. It
makes you hurt, but that is an outcome of your own stupidity. Give
freedom if you want freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one movement is enough. The woman’s liberation movement is
enough, but it is not going in the right direction. It is not becoming a
rebellion, it is becoming a reaction. The woman declares she is equal to
man, so if the man is smoking she has to smoke; she is equal. If the man
is drinking, she has to drink; she is equal. This is not rebellion, this
is reaction.</p><p>Women are turning into lesbians. They feel so much hatred for men
that millions of women don’t want to have any love relationship with
men, they would prefer an unnatural and perverted relationship with a
woman. And it is easier, because a man will never be able to suspect
that his wife has a girlfriend. Even if the two women go on making love
in the house, the husband will never suspect. But if a man comes on the
scene and makes the triangle of all the stories and the films and the
novels, it cannot be long before the husband discovers it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the slavery of women that is turning the women towards
lesbianism, but she thinks this is liberation from men. Dropping love
for men is not liberation, you are becoming perverted.</p><p>Drop the marriage contract, drop the license which has been issued by
the court. Make your man free. Tell him, “It is up to you if you want to
have any love relationships – I have no jealousy, no argument about it.
But I demand the same for myself.” And if there is no slavery, no
bondage between man and woman, perhaps there will be great love
happening – as it happens in my commune.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think so much love is happening anywhere else in the whole
world, because nobody is jealous. People change their partners very
easily. It is just a game: you get tired of playing tennis with one
partner, you find another partner. And nobody is harmed, everybody is
happy.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not find in my commune people who are sad, with long faces.
Even Britishers in my commune are no more British. Even Proper Sagar is
becoming improper!</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s12>34</span></p><p><br></p><p>It’s better to be red than dead</p><p><br></p><p>1 August 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.N., THE ONE-CENT AMERICAN POSTAL
STAMP HAS THE MESSAGE, "WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINE
TO SAVE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS FROM THE SCOURGE OF WAR."</p><p>CAN THE U.N. SAVE HUMANITY FROM WAR?</p><p>The U.N. has proved in these forty years only one thing: that it is
as impotent as its predecessor, the League of Nations. The members of
the U.N. are the people who are going to create the third world war. The
U.N. has no power to prevent it; it is only a debating club, and not of
the best kind. It is not even democratic. The big powers like America
and the Soviet Union have the capacity to veto any resolution. Just one
nation, America or Russia, can stop any resolution which is being passed
by the whole world. Is this democratic? Every nation, small or big, poor
or rich, must have equal rights! In forty years the U.N. has not been
able even to do that.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just keeping people consoled: "Don't be afraid, we are going to
save you." In fact, from whom are they going to save us? They are the
people we have to be saved from! The U.N. has not been able to stop the
increasing amount of nuclear weapons. That should be the first step if
you don't want the third world war. Why wait for the last moment? Why
not start it now? And the basic step will be that no war preparations
are made.</p><p>When everybody is prepared to fight... in fact they will be forced to
fight, just because each country has invested so much energy and power,
and it has piled up nuclear weapons sky high: what are the nations going
to do with those weapons? And they have poured such immense amounts of
money into them. At what point will the U.N. stop them? And the Soviet
Union can just veto it,</p><p>America can veto it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is how politicians have been cheating humanity all along,
throughout the whole history of man. They say one thing and they do just
the opposite. It is very easy to publish a postal stamp that says, "We
the peoples of the United Nations are determined to save humanity from
the scourge of war." Who are these "we"? Have you asked the people of
the world?</p><p>Nobody wants war around the world except these idiotic politicians,
because without war they have no job. War keeps politicians powerful.
People have to depend on politicians because the war is coming.</p><p>Adolf Hitler wrote in his autobiography, My Struggle... he has a few
very important points to make. The first thing he says is that never in
history has a great leader been born unless there is war. That's true.
If there had been no second world war you would have never heard of
Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Winston Churchill, Roosevelt - they all
became stars high in the sky. Of course, millions of people died to make
them great leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>The same has been the case all along, throughout history. The
politician wants to be on the top, as high as possible. If there is
peace, no fight, no war, no preparation for war, he is just ordinary –
perhaps a little bit less intelligent than the average person. His
intelligence is not better than the average person's; it can be
worse.</p><p>Before the Second World War the same promise was given by the League
of Nations: "We are going to save the world from war." But those were
the same people who fought the Second World War. And I say to you, these
same people who constitute the U.N. are going to create the third world
war.</p><p>These stamps are cheap. You can go on befooling humanity, but for how
long? It is time that humanity understands the politician and his
cunningness. Even in the U.N. you cannot be peaceful, discussing in a
friendly way. I said it is only a debating club and not the best one,
because nobody is listening to anybody else. It is a tower of Babel:
everybody is speaking for his government, his nation, his politics, and
is not ready to listen to anything else.</p><p>Do you know what Khrushchev did in the U.N.? He was the premier of
the Soviet Union... and this kind of behavior and the people who behave
in this way can they prevent the Second World War? Then who is going to
start it? Do they think I am going to start the third world war; that
the red people around the world are going to start the third world
war?</p><p><br></p><p>Khrushchev was delivering his talk to the U.N., and he became so
angry that he took his shoe off and started beating on the table with
the shoe! A great history of forty years; not an ordinary history. They
could not prevent even Khrushchev beating their their faces with his
shoe, shouting and screaming at the whole U.N.</p><p>In forty years they have not been able to do anything at all. This is
a sheer wastage of time. The fortieth anniversary should be declared as
the death of the U.N.! Finished! There is no point, they cannot agree.
But the existence of U.N. gives consolation to people: "We don't need to
be worried; the U.N. is taking care of us." And the U.N. consists of
warring nations who have nuclear weapons. They have been talking about
putting a stop to it, but it is just pure talk; nobody stops.</p><p>I think it is time that the people of the world start understanding
the politician and his hypocrisy, his double personality, because if the
third world war happens, then there will be no life on this beautiful
planet. I don't believe at all in this declaration of the U.N., but I
have another program for the people:</p><p><br></p><p>First, don't trust your politicians. Don't be consoled by their
cunning strategies.</p><p>Second, remember that you are going to be destroyed with your
children, with your wife, with your parents, with your trees, with your
animals - everything that is alive on the earth. If the people of the
whole earth simply refuse and say, "We are not going to fight, there is
no point in it," if they refuse and say, "We don't want boundaries of
nations. If there is going to be no war, why keep these boundaries? What
purpose do these boundaries serve?" If the people of the world force
their governments and say, "Disperse all your armies. Let those people
be creative "</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people around the earth, in the army, are just doing
nothing. In fact, they are hankering for war. They are not meditators
who can just sit silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself.
They are very ordinary people. To keep them holding their guns, watching
their nuclear missiles.… How long can you keep them in this situation?
Sooner or later, they will find it is better now to start - "We are
tired and bored "</p><p><br></p><p>This is an established fact, that during the war people are less sad,
more excited and happier than they are in peaceful times, because so
much is going on. Every moment brings new news; excitement is
natural.</p><p>Human history can be divided in two parts: first when there is war;
second, when they are preparing for a new war. There has never been a
period of real peace. Preparing for war is cold war - getting ready,
because the last has taken so much, destroyed so much, that you have to
prepare again. Within ten to twenty years time they are again ready, the
weapons are ready and the enemies are there.</p><p><br></p><p>If really they mean what they say, then take the preliminary steps.
The first is to dissolve boundaries, dissolve passports and green cards.
The world, the whole earth is ours. Wherever we want to be, it is
nobody's business to prevent us. Let there be freedom of movement. Let
all the races, all the nations get mixed. And once the boundaries are
not there, they will get mixed, they will spread all over the world -
all kinds of races - and it will be a great experiment in crossbreeding.
We will have better generations to come.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not enough to save the coming generations from war, if they are
simply carbon copies of you. What is the point? If they are carbon
copies of you, they will do the same as you have been doing. A new man
is needed; a new man who feels the whole earth is his mother - not small
segments of it.</p><p>Do you see? You call your land your motherland and you have cut the
mother into so many pieces - is your mother alive still? You are
carrying only limbs of your mother. Somebody has taken the leg; somebody
has taken the head…</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a religious master. He had two disciples - just as
every democracy has two political parties. Those disciples were
competing in every way to get more attention from the master. And the
question basically was, “who is going to succeed the master?” He was
getting old. So, both were trying their best to serve the master, to
follow the master and to practice the discipline that he has given. But
the motivation was neither the discipline nor the principles. They were
not concerned with the master at all.</p><p>One summer day the master was sleeping, and they were not going to
lose any opportunity. So they both were massaging the legs of the
master. He was tired, naturally - he had come from a long journey. One
was working on the left leg; the other was working on the right leg. The
master was asleep.</p><p>The man who was working on the right leg told the other, "Remember,
if your leg comes on top of my leg, I am not going to tolerate it." The
other said, "And what do you think? I am going to tolerate it? I will
cut off your leg if it comes on my leg!" And they both had their swords
ready.</p><p><br></p><p>The master was not really asleep, no master ever is. He opened his
eyes and said, "Boys, those</p><p>legs are both mine! Who told you that the right leg is owned by one
and the left leg is owned by the other?"</p><p>But this is the situation of the world. The mother earth has been cut
into thousands of pieces. People have to be awakened to the fact, to
stop calling America your motherland, stop calling Germany your
fatherland. You see the difference? The whole world calls its country
the motherland, except Germany! Their land is the fatherland. It is not
a coincidence; they are more male chauvinistic than anybody else. Stop
all this nonsense - and people can do it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am preparing you to spread the fire around the world; that the
whole earth belongs to us. And let the U.N. go on discussing. If they
want to wrestle against each other in the U.N. building, they can have
good boxing matches. It is better than throwing shoes at each other. And
it will be really great entertainment, seeing your great politicians
wrestling. But that will not be decisive as far as the earth is
concerned.</p><p>The people of the earth have to take the responsibility from the
hands of the politicians. And this will be a first step: to erase all
the boundaries. And see how many people they can put in jails; you
cannot put a whole nation in jail.</p><p><br></p><p>All the constitutions of democratic countries accept in their list of
birthrights the right of movement. But where is it? You can move only
within the country. They have given you a little rope to feel that you
are free, but an authentic freedom of movement will mean that anybody
can go anywhere on the earth. Wherever he feels to live, he can live; no
hindrance should be there. Removal of the boundaries will bring one
world and one world functional government.</p><p>The U.N. has no power over anything. I know it… In India, in 1947
after independence, Pakistan invaded Kashmir, which was part of India,
and took over a large chunk of land. India fought against Pakistan. It
could have been the beginning of a third world war, because the land
that Pakistan had taken was very significant; it joined Pakistan with
China.</p><p>Pakistan now could have a road - now they do have a road - going over
the Himalayas to Peking. And China is not on speaking terms with Russia
anymore. China is going to be with America, so that small piece of land
is of immense significance.</p><p>And what did the U.N. do? It did not force Pakistan, because America
would not like that land to be lost, it is a key point in any war in
Asia. So the U.N. did something futile. They said, "First stop the war,
have a cease-fire line." On one side Indian armies have been standing
for forty years, on the other side Pakistani armies have been standing
for forty years. Between the two is the camp of the</p><p>U.N. observers to make sure that the cease-fire line is not crossed
till the matter is settled.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is going to settle it? And if you cannot settle such a small
matter in forty years, how many centuries will you take to settle the
third world war? They cannot settle the matter, because if they settle
in favor of Pakistan, Russia will veto it; the settlement is finished.
If they settle it in favor of India, America will veto it, and the
matter is finished. So it is in limbo, and it is going to be in limbo
perhaps forever, unless my people succeed in dissolving all boundaries;
then that cease-fire line will also dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is a sheer wastage! Thousands of people unnecessarily
standing there with their guns ready, on alert on both sides. Just a
single crackpot can start shooting, just out of boredom. Forty years...!
He was young, now he is old, getting senile. Just for the sake of fun,
if one man starts firing from the other side, then immediately both the
armies will jump up - and nobody will care about the observers. Perhaps
they will be the first ones to be killed.</p><p>What has the U.N. to its credit? Nothing at all. Without any
credibility, to claim that they are going to stop the third world war is
simply befooling the people. They cannot stop the war between India and
Pakistan, between Pakistan and Bangladesh. They cannot stop the war
between Israel and the</p><p>surrounding Mohammedan countries, because everywhere these two great
powers are involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Israel is supported by the Americans, because the American political
parties cannot survive without Jews' donations to their parties. If they
want donations from Jews, they have to stand by Israel. And Russia is
behind the Mohammedan countries, which are bigger, surrounding the small
Israel from all sides. And since the birth of Israel, the child has been
in bed, almost dead. But America is keeping it alive by artificial
breathing. If American steps out, Israel will be finished within a
day.</p><p><br></p><p>America cannot step out, Russia cannot step out. In fact, it is a
good opportunity; America has created it. They have a vast majority of
Mohammedan countries of the whole Middle East sympathetic towards them,
because in any case, these countries will need support. They are all oil
countries; that's why America is hesitating, is now in a fix: if it does
too much, goes a little more towards support of Israel, then all the oil
countries are in the hands of Soviet Russia. And oil is now far more
precious than gold.</p><p><br></p><p>The U.N. in forty years has not been able to do anything - and still
these people have the nerve to say they are going to save the world from
a third world war. Even in small wars they have not been able… What did
the U.N. do in Vietnam? Poor people were being killed unnecessarily by
Americans. It was none of America's business. Vietnam belongs to the
people who live there, and if they want to be communist, who are you to
prevent them? What right have you got? The same was the situation in
Korea. The U.N. has failed utterly, and I am amazed that they are not
even ashamed, and are declaring that they will save the coming
generations from the third world war.</p><p>Only one thing can save the world from the coming war - which will be
a total war, for the first time; all other wars were child's play. This
is going to destroy the whole of life on the earth. Trees, birds,
animals, man - anything living will simply be gone. I say there is one
way only, and that is to spread to people more meditativeness, more
love, more friendliness, more rejoicing. If we can make the earth sing
songs and dance in joy, in gratitude because existence has given so much
- otherwise, it would have been impossible even to purchase one sunrise.
The whole wealth of the earth would not be able to purchase one
sunrise.</p><p>And a sunrise is a big thing - the whole wealth of the earth would
not be able to produce a single rose-flower. And all this is given to
man without his asking. You don't deserve it, you are not worthy of it!
It is out of the compassion of existence, the overflowing joy of
existence, the continuous creativity of existence that you are so rich.
Millions of stars in the night…</p><p><br></p><p>Make people aware of their gratitude towards life, and make people
love, sing and dance. If we can spread this at-ease around the world,
the third world war will be prevented. We need not bother about it.
Joyous people don't want war; it is only those who are already dead who
would like everybody else to be dead. They are really suffering because
they are dead. They cannot laugh, they cannot enjoy, they cannot love;
they cannot feel. They don't have any heart, and others have. It is
making them so jealous! It will be far better that everything is
finished. At least there will be no grounds for their jealousy - they
will also be finished in it.</p><p>So I don't say that there is any direct way to prevent the third
world war. That is what the pacifists of the world say: "Protest. Have
protest marches to Washington, to Moscow" - but nobody listens to those
protest marches. And I have seen those pacifists shouting and screaming
against the war - I could not see any difference between them and the
people who are getting ready to fight. Their screaming was enough proof
that they belonged to the same category.</p><p><br></p><p>If those pacifists had weapons and missiles, they would create a war
to prevent the third world war! The way they are shouting and screaming
and throwing stones, simply shows that they are of the same species as
the politicians against whom they are throwing stones. The difference is
just that the politicians have the power, and they don't have the
power.</p><p>Remember, the husband does not scream at the wife, the wife screams
at the husband. When he gets tired of her nagging and screaming, he hits
the wife, he beats her. And strangely, the wife simply becomes silent.
If she is not beaten, then she is going to drive the man nuts.</p><p>In old countries like India and China, it was told to the
newly-married couple by their elders - the husband was told, "Remember,
once in a while a wife needs beating; otherwise, you will not be able to
live peacefully." But why does the wife scream? Because the husband has
the muscular strength she cannot beat the husband. There are a few
exceptions, but exceptions only prove the rule. She would like to beat
him, but as far as muscular strength is concerned, she cannot compete
with the husband. So the moment the husband starts beating her she
becomes peaceful.</p><p>The weak, the powerless, scream. The powerful takes his gun, puts his
army on alert. The pacifists continually go on protesting. This helps
nobody. Nobody listens to their protest.</p><p>I used to know a man… My house in one city was just near the high
court of the state, so all protest marches, all kinds of pacifists were
passing in front of my door. And I watched them - their behavior did not
seem to be peaceful. They looked uglier than the people in the high
court. But I was amazed that one man was always there, whether the
communist party was protesting, or the socialist party was protesting,
or the people's party was protesting. And in India there are so many
parties… He was always there, with every party.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I got hold of him, and I asked him, "You are an amazing man -
to what party do you belong?" He said, "Who cares? I am a member of all
the parties." I said, "But how it is possible? Communists are against
the socialists, socialists are against the communists. How can you
be?"</p><p>He said, "I am not concerned with their politics - I enjoy screaming!
It is such a healthy thing, that whenever there is a protest I close my
shop; and whoever is protesting, I am always ahead holding the flag." He
said, "It is really healthy."</p><p>I said, "I know. My people are doing it every morning, but they don't
protest about anybody." I said to him, "It is better that you start
dynamic meditation, because these protests happen only once in a while,
and you have to be dependent on these political parties. There is no
need; you can do it on your own.</p><p>He said, "On my own? Alone?" "No," I said, "don't be worried." I had
a meditation hall there. I said, "Every morning many people come there."
And he started coming. Now he is a sannyasin - I don't think for any
other reason, just every day, early in the morning, it is healthy to
scream. It gives you stronger lungs, a better heart, more strength. And
moreover, he need not close his shop anymore; financially it is
good.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a pacifist, and I don't want my people to be pacifists. That
is fighting with those who are preparing for war - but you are doing the
same on a small scale, in a feminine way. No, that won't help. We want
to create our own movement which has nothing to do with the third world
war.</p><p>Do you see my point? If we can make humanity happier, more loving,
more silent, more peaceful, we will create a real barrier against the
third world war. The leaders cannot go without their people. If the
people refuse, the armies refuse, if everybody refuses and says, "I am
so happy, I don't want to die. And I love humanity, so I don't want to
kill. If you can manage on your own, you do it." A peaceful and happy
man does not want to die, and does not want to kill.</p><p><br></p><p>So spread the message far and wide: It's better to be red than
dead!</p><p>Question 2:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT WOMEN CREATE CHILDREN, AND MEN CREATE
ARTS AND OTHER MATERIAL THINGS. IS IT UNNATURAL OR NEUROTIC FOR A WOMAN
NOT TO DESIRE A CHILD, AND TO PREFER TO BE AN ARTIST? I NEVER WANTED TO
HAVE A CHILD. DANCE, MUSIC, POETRY, THEATER AND PAINTING WERE MY PASSION
AND EXPRESSION. COULD YOU COMMENT?</p><p>There is nothing unnatural in it. If you don't want to have a child,
you have the right not to have one. If you want to put your creativity
into painting, into art, into music, it is perfectly good - far better
than creating a child who is bound to be a burden on the earth. And who
knows what kind of child will come out of you? Adolf Hitler can come out
of you. He is waiting, searching for a womb. Joseph Stalin can come out
of you. Beware! That greasy Italian, Mussolini, is waiting. All these
people are standing in line, in a queue. This is not the time to give
birth to a child!</p><p><br></p><p>A painting is harmless. Music is beautiful, dancing will do. No,
there is nothing unnatural in it. It has been said by men again and
again that it is women's natural duty to give birth to children. That's
how they have been able to keep the woman in slavery, because if a woman
goes on giving birth to children, where is the time for her to paint?
Where is the time for her to create music, poetry, drama?</p><p>So on the one hand they have been forcing the woman to remain
continually pregnant. Just a hundred years ago, every woman around the
world was continually pregnant. One child takes nine months of her life;
then she has to raise the child. And when the child is not even six
months old, she is again pregnant. It is like chain-smoking. And even a
single child is such a nuisance…</p><p>I agree with you. I have been asked many times, "Wouldn't you like to
have a child?" I said, "Me? Either I would kill the child or I would
kill myself; we could not coexist! A child in my room? Impossible!" Just
to be alert, I have never married, because who knows? The woman I marry
may want a child. Then trouble will arise.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no problem, unless you feel there is. Don't listen to
anybody, what they say - that it is unnatural. It may be unnatural to
them, so they can give birth to as many children as they want. If you
feel good in painting, in writing poetry, in composing music, you are
giving better children to the world - children who are harmless, who
will make many rejoice. Nothing can go wrong. At the most, your poetry
will not be worth anything, your music just a noise, your painting just
a copy of some other painter, your literature…</p><p><br></p><p>Reading ten books anybody can write the eleventh book. That's how
books go on increasing. There are very few books which are original.
Other books are simply creations of average minds. You can see it in the
films: the same story. Yes, a little bit different in details, but
almost the same triangle. One woman and two men, or two women and one
man - which is a little more exciting - but this triangle is the whole
story of all the stories that have been written, of all the films that
have been created. I sometimes wonder whether this is literature or
geometry! And in geometry there are many other things, not just a
triangle.</p><p><br></p><p>Details you can fit very easily, but this is not creativity. This is
sheer theft, you are stealing. But that is not harm to anybody; you are
just wasting your time. And if you enjoy wasting it, why should anybody
prevent you? But please, don't give birth to a child. At the most he
will be just an average idiot. And the world is so full of idiots that
it is time that the woman refused to give idiots to the world.</p><p>That's why I am for bio-engineering. It is not your birthright to go
on giving birth to as many children as you want, because those children
are going to live on this earth, and they will do something or</p><p>other. Only a medical board should decide about a couple. Unless you
have a clearance from the medical board, you cannot produce a child. And
since the pill it is so simple. Nobody is preventing you from making
love; make love as much as you want, or as much as you can manage! But
as far as children are concerned, you are doing something to the whole
world. Making love you are not doing anything to anybody - just a little
fun between two individuals; the world is not involved in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Children should be born only if a couple gets permission from the
medical board. Still, that is not the best way to do it, because while
he is making love a man releases millions of living beings, millions of
living cells; and it is just chance in that race who will reach the
female egg first. You cannot decide it, you cannot even know it. So this
is not the best way. The medical board may feel that the woman is
healthy, the man is healthy; they can look at your heritage - three,
four generations back - and they can allow you. But this is not the best
way.</p><p><br></p><p>The best way will be for intelligent people to donate their semen to
the hospital, to donate the female eggs to the hospital, so the
hospitals have banks - just like they have blood banks. And they can
figure out which female egg and which male sperm are going to create a
tremendously great, loving genius.</p><p><br></p><p>You can make a condition: "We are donating our sperm and our eggs; if
you find that some combination can create a beautiful human being, we
would like to adopt. If it is not possible, then from other eggs…" What
is the problem? You can't recognize your own sperm, your sperm has no
seal on it; no egg has any seal on it. The medical board can find those
of some other woman, some other man, and you can adopt the child.</p><p>It will be healthier for the society, it will be a beautiful
experience for you to raise a child who is going to be an Albert
Einstein, or a Bertrand Russell, or a Jean-Paul Sartre. What a joy, that
your child is not going to be pope the Polack! That your daughter is not
going to be Mother Teresa! It is sheer joy. And knowing what your child
is going to be… because the medical, the biological study of the sperm
and the egg can give you all the predictions: how long he will live,
what kind of man he will be</p><p>- or woman; how he should be brought up so that his potential flowers
and he is not distracted from his potential. It will be really a work of
art, far more precious than any painting, because you will be giving to
the world a treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am all for bio-engineering. And this stupid way of producing
children has done enough harm. The whole history is full of it. Don't
you ever think that if a gardener plants thousands of trees, and only
once in a while one tree flowers - would you call that gardener a
gardener? Thousands of children are born, and rarely will someone become
a Mozart or a Gautam Buddha. Most of them will be clerks, postmasters,
stationmasters. Your son being a clerk, even if he becomes the head
clerk, is not going to bring you the rejoicing that I would like. And
these jobs soon will be transferred to the machines, to the computers.
The clerks are going to be out of employment very soon.</p><p>Don't produce clerks! Don't produce station-masters, postmasters. We
have had enough. Now machines can take the place of all ordinary jobs.
But the machine cannot become a Bertrand Russell, a Wittgenstein or a
Martin Heidegger; that is beyond the computer.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to create a child which will be needed, and cannot be
replaced by any machine, otherwise, everybody is going to be unemployed,
hungry, starving. It will not be only in Ethiopia, it will be all over
the world. And the machine is more reliable than your beloved son who
has become the clerk.</p><p><br></p><p>Just now I got the information that they have made a computer
especially for Mohammedans, be- cause the Mohammedan has to pray facing
towards Mecca, his holy land. But it is really a difficult job to be
absolutely accurate. Most probably you are wrong; there is only a small
chance that you are exactly facing towards Mecca. A computer has come
onto the market: you just put the machine</p><p>on, move the machine, and when it starts giving an alarm that means
this is the place; you are absolutely accurate.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps my sannyasins will also need it. Where you face while you are
doing your gachchhamis is just approximate. A computer can make it a
hundred percent certain. The same computer that Mohammedans are using,
with a little change, will be able to do your work too. Then around the
earth, wherever you are, you can do the gachchhamis directed towards
me!</p><p><br></p><p>Please give birth to a child who cannot be replaced by machines, by
computers. And that is possible only if you drop that old jealous idea
that the semen has to be yours; that the egg has to be your wife's. I
don't see what is so special about your semen and your wife's egg. Why
bother about it? And you have practiced that thing for thousands of
years - just look at the world, what you have done! Such a mediocre lot.
And if this mediocre lot is there, it is very difficult to get rid of
politicians.</p><p>If you can give birth to children that have the highest possibility
of intelligence, I don't think they will vote for any chimpanzee to be
the president of America. In fact, all political parties will disappear,
because every individual will have enough intelligence to decide on his
own. He does not need any political propaganda; he does not need to be
persuaded. It is an insult.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never voted in my life, for anything, but when there were
elections politicians would come, not knowing. And then they would get
into trouble, because I would ask them questions.</p><p>They said, "We have not come here to take an examination."</p><p>I said, "But first, I have to examine your mind. How can I vote for
an idiot? You have to prove that you have some genius in you."</p><p>They said, "This is strange. Nobody asks whether you have genius in
you or not."</p><p>I said, "Unless you prove that you have genius in you, I cannot give
my support to you to be in power. You can be dangerous to humanity." I
would criticize their political line, their ideology, and say, "You have
to defend it." They wanted to escape; they wanted to find some excuse. I
would say, "This is not going to do. And remember, if you fail with me,
I am going to tell all the neighbors and all the professors around that
this is not the man to vote for."</p><p>I have seen tears in their eyes: why in the first place did they get
caught with this man? Slowly it be- came known, and for years no
politician has approached me in election time to vote. I have been
waiting for them, I enjoyed the game.</p><p><br></p><p>No, these mediocre people are not needed. They are accidental. The
children that you think are yours are only accidents. Because you are
not giving birth consciously, you are groping in the dark; you don't
know what the result is going to be. With bio-engineering, for the first
time you can have guidelines for the child's whole future. You can even
tell the medical board what kind of child you would like, how long he
should live, that you would not like him to have AIDS, that you don't
want him to be a homosexual, that you don't want him to be a Catholic or
a communist. You want him to be simply human and absolutely free from
all ideology. You would like him to have the sharpest intelligence that
has ever happened on the earth. You would like something better than
Socrates.</p><p>And this is possible. When you can have Socrates as your child, then
why go for Tom, Dick and Harry? Just leave my Harry out of it!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>SANNYASINS WHO ARE DYING IN YOUR PRESENCE DISCOVER THEIR
ENLIGHTENMENT. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE STILL
ALIVE? IS IT THAT LIFE</p><p>COMES SO CLOSE TO DEATH, AND WE ARE AFRAID OF DYING YET STILL NOT
CAPABLE OF BEING ALIVE IN THIS PRECIOUS MOMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is an important question. It may have arisen in many people's
mind: "Why, when a person dies, is it easy to become enlightened? The
same person when he was alive was not capable of becoming enlightened."
The reason is very simple. When you are alive you cannot drop your ego,
you cannot drop your jealousy. You cannot drop your hatred, anger,
greed, because you think these are all that life consists of. If you
drop all these, what is there to live for? You cannot drop your
ambition; otherwise your life will be simply meaningless. That is your
reasoning. And enlightenment requires as a basic condition that all this
luggage should be thrown. You should stand absolutely in purity, without
any luggage, without even any clothes, just naked.</p><p>Those who can gather that much courage, can become enlightened any
moment. But when a sannyasin is dying it is easy for him. Now he knows
that he is dying: what use is ambition? What use is hatred? What use is
jealousy? What use is greed? What use is the ego?</p><p><br></p><p>Death standing in front of his eyes makes it clear that now he can
drop all that unnecessary luggage: anyway, death is going to take all
that away. It happens in a single moment - the whole idea, the
revelation that now there is nothing to be lost - so why not try? "Osho
has been saying, ’Drop this, drop that.' I could not do it while I was
alive, but now there is no problem. Take a chance – see whether he was
right or wrong."</p><p>And this is not a long process of thinking. It is a simple experience
in a single moment before death. And the person simply slips out of the
old, rotten bag in which he has been living; now he can feel the stink
and everything. Death immediately becomes enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Then death is no longer ordinary death, then death is a door to the
divine. You can do it while you are living, there is no problem. In
fact, to do it when you are dying is not of much use: you never got to
enjoy it. While you are alive, if you can do what I say, you will have
time to enjoy enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>And enlightenment is not something that is given to you, handed over
to you. Enlightenment is a growing process in you. The man who becomes
enlightened at the moment of death has missed much. He has missed all
the joys of life, which are available only to the enlightened
consciousness. He had loved, but that love was simply phony, American.
If he had had the chance to love after enlightenment, he would have
known the tremendous beauty of it, the ecstasy of it. He has been eating
tasteful, delicious food all his life, but he was asleep, he had no
sensitivity. He was never in the moment; while he was eating, he was
somewhere else faraway - perhaps on the moon.</p><p>The enlightened man is always in the moment; hence, every experience
becomes intense, enjoyed to the fullest.</p><p>It is better to die enlightened than to die unenlightened. At least
there is one thing left for you to experience as an enlightened man:
that is death. But much more you have missed. So I will not suggest to
you to wait for death. Certainly those who are with me are going to
become enlightened at the moment of death, but why wait for it when you
are young and alive and full of juice? Becoming enlightened at the time
of death, you are just a dry bone, there is no juice left; otherwise why
should you die? When you are full of juice, full of life, with all the
dimensions available, become enlightened.</p><p>And the process is so simple that even a dying man can manage it. It
is really a shame that you are alive and you cannot manage it. Perhaps
you only think you are alive. Perhaps you only dream you are alive, and
death is such a shock that you wake up. But I am here to give you any
kind of shock you need. I am giving you them already without asking your
permission, because the moment you become a sannyasin I take it for
granted that now I do not need any permission to give this man a shock -
any kind of shock.</p><p>Drop all that nonsense which is holding you back from experiencing
life in its totality. Drop all that which is keeping you in a narcotic
sleep. And what I am asking you to drop is worthless, perhaps worse than
worthless. It is poison that you are not dropping, that you are holding
on to: Jealousy is poison, hate is poison; greed is poison. The ego is
perhaps the most dangerous poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other night I was talking to a woman journalist. She had
come directly from Billy Graham - she had been covering Billy Graham for
three weeks, and of course she asked about him. And I said, "He is a
worthless man. None of my sannyasins will be impressed with that idiot,
and none of his audience is going to understand me. His audience
consists of retarded people. His face itself looks retarded. Whenever I
see his photograph I simply close my eyes. He looks like a chimpanzee,
well shaved."</p><p>I told her, "My work and his work are totally opposite, diametrically
opposite. He is giving consolation to people so they can sleep better.
He is telling them, `Have faith in Jesus Christ, he is the savior. He
can do anything; he is the only begotten son of God. If things are not
happening to you, if miracles are not happening to you, that only shows
your faith is not enough. Have more faith and your life will be filled
with miracles."</p><p><br></p><p>This is consoling people, helping them to go into deeper sleep. My
work is totally different. If you are asleep and snoring perfectly, I
will do everything that can be done so that you have to jump out of bed.
I know you will try every possible way… I will tickle your nose, and you
will throw my hand away. I will tickle your feet, and you will pull them
in. I may tickle with a hair in your ear, and you will turn to the other
side. To protect yourself you will pull the blanket over yourself. But
nothing is going to help, no blanket can save you.</p><p><br></p><p>And sooner or later you are going to get tired of all these things
that I am doing to you. You will have to open your eyes and see what is
happening. Those who are not courageous enough to wake up, those camels
start moving on the county road which goes to Santa Fe, with all their
blankets, with their sleeping bags. Only courageous people can remain
with me, because I may throw ice-cold water over you. And if nothing
else works, then some electric shock. But I am determined to wake
you!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DO ENLIGHTENED MASTERS LIE OUT OF COMPASSION?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not know about other enlightened people, but I certainly
lie!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/new-folder-with-items/tantra_experience_163p/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Microsoft Word - Osho - Tantra Experience.doc</span>

A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, YOU ADOPTED A VOW OF SILENCE. RECENTLY, YOU HAVE DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT TO YOUR SUPPORTERS AND THEN TO US HERE TODAY. WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT NOW?\nANSWER: I live spontaneously. I never decide anything beforehand. I keep tomorrow open. If I feel like speaking, I speak. If I feel like being silent, then there is no other way than to be silent. And I never ask myself why, because no why is answerable. All answers are arbitrary. So I simply go on floating with the river, never asking where it is going, why it is going, where it is going to end. And this is my basic approach to life: a total letgo.\nQ: WAS THERE A REASON THAT YOU DECIDED TO ADOPT THE VOW OF SILENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, OR WAS THERE ALSO NO REASON?\nA: There is never any reason. I don't live by reason. I simply allow things to happen. I don't know why I became silent. I don't know why I started to speak again, but I enjoyed being silent and I'm enjoying being out of silence again. I don't know about tomorrow. I may be silent, I may be speaking. I may not be here at all.\nQ: WHEN YOU WENT BEFORE THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE FOR A VISA AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER, THE COMMENT WAS MADE BY THE OFFICIALS OF THE SERVICE THAT HOW COULD YOU BE A RELIGIOUS LEADER IF YOU DIDN'T SPEAK? DID THAT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON YOU AT ALL?\nA: No. Nothing influences me. Nor do I want anybody to be influenced by me, because the very fact of being influenced is a kind of mental slavery. I keep\nmyself totally free from influences, and I never influence anybody, never try to convert, convince anybody.\nI am the first one who can claim to be religious. The whole past and its religions have been pseudo, false. To me religion has a totally different meaning. There is no God. There is no heaven and hell. All those past religions have exploited man with fear of hell and greed for heaven, and all those religions have kept man retarded, dependent on God, a big daddy somewhere above who is taking care of you. This made man irresponsible. This made man unintelligent.\nMy religion is basically centered around consciousness, silence, and silence has its own way of communication. Just as words speak, but can be misunderstood- they ARE misunderstood-silence also speaks. It also can be misunderstood. To understand silence, the other side, the receiving side, should also be silent. Then there is a meeting of the hearts. Something starts falling into tune, harmony, a kind of synchronicity. Nothing is said, nothing is heard, but everything is understood. Lovers know it; just sitting side by side saying nothing, something goes on moving between them.\nQ: IF YOU WERE TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE LISTENING AND WATCHING WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR YOUR RELIGION...\nWHAT IS YOUR THEOLOGY, WHAT IS YOUR BELIEF WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE?\nA: I have no system of belief I have no catechism like Christians, and I don't have any dogmas, principles, theology. If somebody wants to understand me he will have to learn meditation, learn being silent and sit with me, live with me. There is no other way. All those belief systems are nothing but a process of conditioning you.\nA belief simply means you don't know -- still you believe. My effort here is that you never believe unless you know. When you know, there is no question of believing, you know it. I destroy all belief systems and I do not give you any substitute. Hence, it is not easy to understand me.\nQ: YOU HAVE NO PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE?\nA: No philosophy of life. I have LIFE itself. There are people who have philosophies of life, but they don't have any life.\nQ: YOUR PHILOSOPHY, IF THERE IS ONE, HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN \"THE THREE L'S, \" LOVE, LIFE, LAUGHTER. IS THAT A PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE?\nA: No.\nQ: COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?\nA: It is just a consequence of being silent and in tune with existence. Love arises in you. Life becomes abundant; laughter, for no reason, just because this whole existence is so hilarious. This is not philosophy, this is the consequence of being silent.\nQ: IS IT TO ENJOY LIFE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW?\nA: There is no tomorrow. If there is tomorrow, you cannot stop worrying about it. Tomorrow never comes, it is a process of worrying. Nor is there any yesterday. One is no more, one is not yet. All that is in our hands is the present moment, now, here. And this is a miraculous experience. If there is no yesterday, no tomorrow, and this very moment you are silent, all worrying disappears. All imagining, dreaming, projecting disappears.\nAnd it is not that you have to enjoy this moment. That rejoicing arises out of this moment. But you are never here, you are always somewhere else. You are never in the now, you are always then. Otherwise, everything is available, but you are absent. I want my people to understand a very simple fact -- not a philosophy, something existential, not philosophical -- be present to this moment and then see what happens.\nQ: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID A MOMENT AGO. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN CONTROLLING PEOPLE, AND HAVE NO CONTROL. BUT DO YOU NOT HAVE EITHER CONTROL OR TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OVER 350,000 OF YOUR FOLLOWERS?\nA: I don't have any control. I don't give these half million people who love me any discipline. I don't give them any commandments. I insistently emphasize that they are not my followers, but only fellow travelers. It is up to them to go a few miles with me or not to go. If they join with me, I'm happy; when they depart, I say goodbye.\nQ: IF THEY LOOK TO YOU, THEY WORSHIP YOU, WOULD THEY THEN NOT DO WHATEVER YOU TELL THEM?\nA: I am trying on my part that there should be no worship. They should not be influenced by me. But if they worship and if they go on being influenced, they are not understanding me.\nQ: WHO IS BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH? HOW DID YOU BECOME BHAGWAN?\nA: The word Bhagwan means \"the Blessed One.\" When people started feeling my blessing throbbing in their hearts, when they started feeling that something has happened to me of immense value which they would like to share, they started calling me Bhagwan. I could not deny it because it was a fact: I was the Blessed One.\nQ: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE THE BLESSED ONE?\nA: How do I know when I have a headache? I know Q: WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT?\nA: Thirty-two years ago.\nQ: HOW DID YOU KNOW IT?\nA: That question is absurd. When you are sick, you know. How do you know? When you are healthy, you know. How do you know? That \"how\" is absurd. You simply know it.\nQ: WAS THERE A VISION?\nA: No, there is no question of vision. Vision is always objective, of something else. It was an experiencing. Not even an experience, but experiencing. I was full of it. I was it. And since then not for a single moment have I been otherwise. It was not something that happened and disappeared. It was a transformation. It has remained with me.\nQ: DID YOU KNOW AS A CHILD, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU WOULD BECOME THE ENLIGHTENED ONE?\nA: No. I never knew... not even a single moment before. But I was searching from my very childhood. I was seeking and trying in every possible way not to be influenced by any religion, by any ideology, because if I am already having a faith, already believing, the search stops. The inquirer has to be very alert and aware that no belief enters into his being. He has to remain open and agnostic, knowing perfectly well that he does not know. From that space of not knowing, the search, the seeking, arises. But who can say when it is going to be fulfilled? It is unpredictable.\nQ: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A GOD?\nA: My God! There is no God, so how can I consider myself a god? God is the greatest lie invented by man.\nQ: WHY?\nA: Because man feels so helpless, so afraid of death, so burdened with life's problems. Because he has been raised by a father, by a mother, and those were the beautiful days -- no responsibility, no worry -- somebody was taking care of him. That psychological childhood is projected into all the religions: God becomes the father. And there are a few religions in which God becomes the mother. It is a simple psychological projection of a child. It has no basis in reality. And whenever you are afraid, whenever you are in trouble, you start seeking help. No help ever comes. Even Jesus on the cross was waiting for the help to come, and finally got disappointed and shouted, \"Father, have you forsaken me?\" A great doubt must have arisen in him, a great question. Nothing is happening, and he was believing all these years that God would come to save him, his only begotten son. Nobody came. Jesus Christ must have died in utter disillusionment.\nI don't have any illusion. I cannot be disillusioned.\nQ: HE ALSO SAID, \"FATHER, FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.\"\nA: That was again the same mind. I call Jesus' mind sick. Q: WHY?\nA: Because his whole life... whatsoever he was teaching and doing was just nuts. Only a crackpot can claim to be the only son of God. And then, preaching to people that he is the savior, and whosoever is with him will be saved, and whosoever is not with him will fall into hell -- eternal hell... all these things. His behavior: he cursed a fig tree because he and his disciples were hungry and there were no fruits on the fig tree. In fact, it was not the season; it was not the fault of the fig tree, but he cursed the fig tree.\nI cannot conceive of this man as sane. And this prayer to God that, \"Forgive these people because they know not what they are doing,\" is again out of that same arrogant, egoistic idea. I don't think that it is out of compassion. It is the emphasis of the Christians for centuries that out of compassion he prayed even for his enemies. But let me repeat his sentence: \"Forgive these people because they know not what they are doing.\" In fact, it was not an act of compassion, he was still condemning the people that they knew not and he knew.\nQ: BUT HAVEN'T THERE BEEN SOME TEACHINGS HANDED DOWN FROM JESUS WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF MUCH THAT IS GOOD IN CIVILIZATION TODAY?\nA: Nothing. Not a single thing has come out of Jesus which has helped humanity in any way. All those teachings have proved not blessings, but curses. They are beautiful words and because they have been repeated so often, you have -- and everybody has -- forgotten the implications of them.\nHe says, \"Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God.\" It looks beautiful, but basically it is ugly. It is a consolation to the poor. It is an exploitation of the poor. It is giving false hope to the poor, and the ultimate result is that the world has remained poor.\nWho would not like to inherit the kingdom of God? Jesus says that even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but a rich man cannot enter through the gates of heaven. Now this man is responsible for all the poverty in the world. He is condemning richness. He is condemning the creativity which can make the world rich.\nI am all for richness in all dimensions, and I cannot say, Blessed are the poor. That is just what Karl Marx said: Opium of the people. It is possible to use beautiful words, but if you go into the implications, what are the Christians doing today and what have they done for two thousand years? They will open orphanages. They are against birth control. They are against abortion.\nQ: SOME OF THEM.\nA: Those who are not will soon be expelled. They are being expelled. And those who are... for example the pope himself is against abortion, against birth control. He is against the greatest revolution in humanity -- the pill. Population goes on growing, poverty goes on growing, and who is responsible for this? I think these people are criminals.\nQ: THE POPE?\nA: The pope. He should be behind bars. Q: WHY?\nA: Teaching such stupid things to humanity: go on producing children -- they are gifts of God. He is responsible for Ethiopia. He is responsible for poor India. Anywhere poverty happens, these people are responsible. On the one hand, they go on increasing the population, which is already too much, in the name of God. But the real thing is that they can convert only the poor to Christianity. I have\nnever seen a single rich man being converted to Christianity in India. Beggars, orphans, prostitutes-these people get converted.\nQ: IS THERE ANY PART OF CHRISTIANITY, HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, ANY OF THE ESTABLISHED RELIGIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE GOOD?\nA: Nothing is. I want to be finished with the whole past completely, I want it to be erased completely. I want a discontinuity with the past. Only then the new humanity is possible, a new world, a new man. So I categorically say everything is wrong. And the proof is there: the whole world is in a mess. These are the people who have given the world principles how to live, ideologies, systems. This is the outcome of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. This is the outcome.\nQ: YOU SAY THE WHOLE WORLD IS A MESS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE IN MAN, IN THE WORLD?\nA: I'm simply saying that there is a way to be sane. I'm saying that you can get rid of all this insanity created by the past in you.\nQ: HOW?\nA: Just by being a simple witness of your thought processes. That's my method of meditation. It is not a prayer because there is no God to pray to. It is simply sitting silently, witnessing the thoughts passing before you. Just witnessing -- not interfering, not even judging, because the moment you judge you have lost the pure witness. The moment you say this is good, this is bad, you have already jumped into the thought process. It takes a little time to create a gap between the witness and the mind. Once the gap is there, you are in for a great surprise: you are not the mind, you are the witness, a watcher.\nThis process of watching is the very alchemy of real religion, because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing, thoughts start disappearing. A moment comes when there is no thought at all. You are, but the mind is utterly empty. That is the moment of enlightenment. That is the moment when for the first time you become unconditioned, sane, a really free human being.\nQ: BHAGWAN, SINCE YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS WRITTEN -- ALLEGED\n-- ABOUT YOU AND THE RAJNEESHEES. SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE SPEAKING IN PUBLIC, I'D LIKE TO GET YOU TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID. FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT\nYOU AS A \"FREE SEX GURU,\" BELIEVING IN PROMISCUOUS SEX WITH VIOLENT ENCOUNTER SESSIONS AND MIND CONTROL. TRUE OR FALSE?\nA: Do you think sex should be charged for? Should it not be free? Should it be paid for?\nTo me, sex is a simple, beautiful, natural phenomenon. If two persons want to share the energy with each other, it is nobody's business to interfere. And to say \"free sex\" implies that you want sex also to be a commodity, that it has to be purchased -- either from a prostitute for one night or from a wife for the whole life, but it has to be purchased and paid for.\nYes, I believe in free sex. I believe that sex is everybody's birthright to share, to enjoy. It is fun. There is nothing serious about it. The people who have been talking about me as teaching free sex are really pathetic. They are sexually repressed people.\nQ: I THINK WHAT THEY WERE IMPLYING IS THE IMAGE OF WILD SEXUAL ORGIES GOING ON.\nA: No orgies are going on. And if people should want an orgy, it is nobody's business. If a few people want group sex, what is harmful in it? If two persons can enjoy, why cannot ten persons enjoy together? Once we think of sex as a natural, joyful fun.…\nThat's why I call the pill the greatest revolution since fire was discovered. The pill has freed sex from all nonsense, seriousness, marriage, legalities. It has made man enjoy sex for the first time as man, not like other animals who are in a biological bondage.\nNo orgies are happening here, but I am not prohibiting them. It is up to the people. If they feel like having an orgy, so far so good. But these people are also conditioned by your society. They also have the idea of relationship one to one. They also have the monopoly, monogamy, planted in their minds.\nQ: IS THAT NOT GOOD?\nA: It is absolutely unnatural. Man is not a monogamous animal at all. He is polygamous and everybody knows it. You may have the most beautiful wife, but that does not mean you don't get attracted to other women, that once in a while you don't dream about other women. Somebody may have the best possible husband. That does not make any difference. Man is by nature polygamous. Monogamy iS enforced on him.\nQ: ARE YOU SAYING THAT MAN SHOULD FOLLOW HIS POLYGAMOUS INSTINCTS?\nA: He should simply follow nature wherever it leads. Polygamy is perfectly good. In fact, there is no need for monogamy or polygamy. I'm a little further ahead. I see the relationship of love or sex as an absolutely free phenomenon.\nQ: YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING-AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE SUGGESTED BEFORE\n-- THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY \"WESTERN HANGUPS, \" SO CALLED, ABOUT SEX. RECENTLY YOU PREDICTED THAT AlDS WILL KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, AND YOU TOLD YOUR FOLLOWERS TO ENGAGE IN CELIBACY OR HAVE SEX WITH ONE PARTNER. WHY?\nA: AIDS is a totally new phenomenon, and the old religions are again responsible for it.\nQ: RESPONSIBLE FOR AIDS? A: For AIDS.\nQ: WHY?\nA: They are responsible for everything that is wrong. Homosexuality and all kinds of perversions were created by religious people, by teaching celibacy. Now, to force men or women to remain celibate is taking them against their biology, chemistry, physiology -- their whole nature. It is impossible for them. They will find some way, and it will be perverted.\nNuns were kept in one monastery, monks were kept in another monastery. There are monasteries still where no woman has ever entered. Now these monks are the original homosexuals. These nuns are the pioneers of lesbianism. All kinds of perverted things have brought AIDS as the ultimate result.\nI'm not telling my people to be celibate because celibacy has any spirituality. I'm telling them that you can be celibate without any repression, just out of sheer understanding. You are not going to be rewarded in heaven for it, you will just be being careful about your health. That is enough reward. But if you feel that celibacy is difficult for you, then use all possible methods to protect, to prevent. AIDS is going to kill the larger part of humanity.\nQ: WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?\nA: Because it is spreading so fast. And it will spread... just one contact with a person who has AIDS is enough, and then those contacts will go on spreading. Just the other day I was looking into it because we were having the festival. Fifteen thousand people were going to come here from all over the world. Now it was a problem: many people can bring AIDS and destroy the whole commune.\nWe tried to find out. Two sannyasins had it confirmed, and we asked them how many other contacts they had. One woman had fifty contacts. Those fifty people may be carrying AIDS and may be having other contacts. That's why I have said remain with one partner. It is nothing to do with monogamy, it is just pure hygiene, health. I am telling that on medical grounds, there is no religious basis to it.\nQ: BHAGWAN, LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT. AGAIN, IN KEEPING WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AND SAID ABOUT YOU AND THE RAJNEESHEES, AND THAT IS THE FEAR WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOUR BODYGUARDS CARRYING WEAPONS -- SUBMACHINE GUNS-AND RUMORS THAT THERE ARE LARGE CACHES OF WEAPONS HERE ON THE RANCH. IS THAT TRUE? AND IF SO, WHY ARE THE WEAPONS KEPT HERE?\nA: I'm not a man like Jesus Christ. I will not carry my cross on my own shoulders. And I'm not suicidal. Jesus must have been suicidal. I love life, my people love life. I'm not afraid of death. I will enjoy death as much as life, but my people don't want me to leave the body now, and they have every right to protect me. I'm not going to prevent anybody who is going to assassinate me. Why should I prevent my people from protecting me?\nIf the assassin is free, I'm not going to interfere. And the people who love me and want to protect me, I'm not interfering with them either. This is something between those who love me and those who hate me. This is their business, I am simply out of it. Yes, guns are there, but not according to the rumors. Those rumors are too much exaggerated.\nQ: LARGE NUMBERS OF GUNS?\nA: No, not large numbers.\nQ: DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ATTACKED? ARE YOU AFRAID OF ATTACK?\nA: I am not afraid of anything. I have been attacked many times before. I can be attacked any time and I'm not concerned about it, but my people are concerned. Who am I to prevent them if they love me and want to do something? And I have around me one of the most intelligent groups of people.\nJesus had only twelve fools -- uneducated, unintelligent fishermen, carpenters -- and he himself was uneducated, uncultured. And when he was crucified they all escaped. They were not in love with Jesus; they were hoping that through Jesus they would enter into paradise and enjoy paradise.\nI give no hope to my people, no promise to my people. They are not going to gain anything as reward.\nQ: SO WHY SHOULD THEY STAY HERE?\nA: They stay here because meditation is its own reward. There is no other reward beyond it.\nQ: IN FACT, RECENTLY YOU SEEM TO BE PAINTING A VERY PESSIMISTIC FUTURE OF THE WORLD AND MANKIND WHEN YOU WARNED THAT A CYCLONE OF DESTRUCTION BOTH NATURAL AND MAN MADE WILL HIT THE WORLD, AND THAT THE RAJNEESH RELIGION WILL PROVIDE A \"NOAH'S ARK OF CONSCIOUSNESS,\" ALLOWING YOUR SUPPORTERS TO SURVIVE.\nA: It is not pessimistic. It is simply factual.\nQ: COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nA: It simply means that all the centuries that have passed have been bringing this day closer and closer. Religions have been talking about peace and fighting and killing and murdering, burning people alive. On the one hand they will say God is love, on the other hand they will be burning living people. Christians have been killing, Mohammedans have been killing, Hindus have been killing. It is a strange phenomenon that Buddha was born in India, but in India there are no Buddhists. For twenty-five centuries there have been no Buddhists. They had to escape because Hindus were killing them.\nQ: BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS CYCLE OF DESTRUCTION?\nA: We have destroyed the harmony of nature through our unguarded scientific experiments. We have now in the hands of politicians; who are the most mediocre people in the world, such immense energy to destroy that they can destroy this whole earth seven hundred times. Now if just one politician goes nuts, that's enough -- and they are all nuts. So I am not painting any pessimistic picture of the future. I am not a pessimist, neither am I an optimist. I am simply a realist.\nQ: BHAGWAN, A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE NOT PESSIMISTIC; YET, IF I MAY READ ANOTHER QUOTE WHEREIN YOU SAID \"THIS WORLD IS NOT WORTH SAVING. ONCE IN A WHILE I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER IF THE THIRD WORLD WAR HAPPENS AND DESTROYS THIS WHOLE STUPID HUMANITY.\" ISN'T THAT PESSIMISTIC? VERY GLOOMY?\nA: This is optimistic!\nQ: WHY?\nA: Because if something has become so rotten, it is better to be finished with it. Q: YOU THINK THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED?\nA: The world has become almost a madhouse. If we cannot change people's consciousness, if we cannot destroy the boundaries between nations, the boundaries between colors, and the boundaries between religions -- if that is not going to happen.…\nI am trying on my own whatsoever I can; but one cannot simply forget the reality. The world is divided into nations, into religions, all fighting and trying to kill each other. One cannot forget America and Soviet Russia, ready to destroy the whole world any moment. This is simple realism. As I see it, this humanity, if it is not going to change, is not worth saving.\nQ: BUT YOU, AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER, SHOULDN'T YOUR ROLE BE ONE TO ENLIGHTEN AND TO HELP TO CHANGE...?\nA: That I am doing.…\nQ: RATHER THAN TO SAY THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED?\nA: That is part of my effort. That makes my thing emphatically clear: Either change, or the world is going to be destroyed. So your change is absolutely necessary. It is not something that can wait, that tomorrow we will change.\nQ: LET ME GO BACK... I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE TO OREGON, YOUR SUPPORTERS SAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE OVER THE TOWN OF ANTELOPE. YET NOW RAJNEESHEES ARE IN CONTROL OF THE TOWN AND THE RESIDENTS THERE HAVE CHARGED THAT THEY WERE FORCED OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS THE RAJNEESHEES REALLY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE STATE OF OREGON. TRUE, OR FALSE?\nA: I want first to make it clear that I am not a Rajneeshee. You should ask Rajneeshees -- that is their problem. I am an outsider. I am just a guest here, not even a resident. I am not even living in the City of Rajneeshpuram, but outside the city in a guest house. I am not a Rajneeshee; I don't belong to any organization. Now, whatsoever they are doing, you should ask them.\nQ: WELL, WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE THEM TAKE OVER THE STATE OF OREGON?\nA: I would like them to take the whole world! -- because I feel that they can manage this world better than anybody else. But I am not interested. I am not a politician, and that is not my concern.\nQ: THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT YOU AND YOUR RELIGIOUS FOLLOWING ARE EXTREMELY WEALTHY. IF IT'S TRUE, WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM?\nA: My people are rich. In fact, only the very rich, educated, intelligent, cultured can understand what I am saying. Beggars cannot come to me. Poor people cannot come to me. The gap is too big. They can hear me but they cannot understand me. So it is natural: I am the rich man's guru.\nQ: ISN'T THAT A CONTRADICTION WITH THE TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION OF A LIFE OF AUSTERITY LED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND ASCETICS?\nA: I simply think those traditions just rubbish. There is no question of contradiction; I am simply against them. I don't want to be consistent with them. I want to drop all connections with the past. They have done enough harm.\nMy conception of a beautiful, flowering being is not that of austerity, it is of luxury. He will enjoy all that is beautiful in the world -- great paintings, great music, poetry. I don't conceive of him standing on his head in the hot sun of Oregon, fasting, slowly destroying himself. To me, all religions of the world up to now have been sado-masochistic. My religion is for the first time life- affirming.\nQ: ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE REMEMBER ABOUT YOU WHEN THEY READ STORIES OR SEE YOU ON TELEVISION IS THE FACT THAT YOU OWN SO MANY, OR HAVE SO MANY ROLLS ROYCES. WHY IS THAT?\nA: How many? Q: EIGHTY?\nA: No.\nQ: FORTY?\nA: Ninety. And they are not so many. Q: WHY DO YOU NEED NINETY?\nA: I don't need even a single one. And they don't belong to me, either. But my people want 365, one for every day. And I go for a drive only for one hour. But if my people want it, if they are happy and rejoice doing it, I don't want to destroy their joy. It is perfectly okay.\nQ: COULDN'T YOU TELL THEM TO GIVE THEIR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE, OTHER THAN FOR ROLLS ROYCES?\nA: All other religions are doing that. Let them do that as their work. Let me do my work. All other religions are looking after the poor. At least leave me alone to look after the rich.\nQ: BHAGWAN, THERE HAVE BEEN FEARS EXPRESSED, AS YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE YOU FIRST GOT TO OREGON, THAT RAJNEESHPURAM MIGHT TURN INTO ANOTHER JONESTOWN.\nA: That's absurd.\nQ: ARE THERE ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOU AND JIM JONES?\nA: There is only one thing between me and Reverend Jim Jones, and that is of absolute opposition. He was a Christian, and Christians are cowards, afraid to take the responsibility for whatsoever happened in Jonestown. From Jesus till this Pope the Polack, all are responsible for it, because Christianity is a death- oriented religion. The cross is its symbol.\nThere is nothing common between me and Reverend Jim Jones. Everything is opposite to him.\nQ: PEOPLE THINK THE POWER YOU HAVE OVER YOUR FOLLOWERS.…\nA: I don't have any power. I don't have any position. I don't even know my people by their names.\nQ: BUT YOU SEE THEM OUT THERE EVERY DAY AS YOU DRIVE BY.\nA: I see them, but I don't even know their names. I don't relate with them personally, I don't talk with them personally.\nWhat power? I don't have any power.\nQ: YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE DEVOTED TO YOU.\nA: That is their thing. I am not exploiting their devotion for any power for myself. I could have declared myself the only begotten son of God. Then it would have been a power trip. But I say I am simply an ordinary man just like you. And I emphasize it again and again so that my people can understand that if this experience can happen to me, it can happen to them, too. It is nothing special. It is absolutely natural and ordinary.\nQ: SO YOU SEE NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN RAJNEESHPURAM AND JONESTOWN?\nA: Not at all. But I see every similarity between Jonestown and the whole world. Q: THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL END UP LIKE THAT?\nA: They are trying. Seventy-five percent of their national incomes is going into making more and more weapons, nuclear weapons. Even poor countries are trying to create nuclear plants. They are all in tune with Reverend Jim Jones. Except Rajneeshpuram, the whole world has a similarity with him. This is the only place. We are absolutely opposed to destruction. We believe in creativity.\nWe don't believe in the creator, we believe in creativeness.\nAnd my people are creative. They have changed the shape of this desert, with all the hindrances from the state, the government, the politicians, the religious people. Still, they have changed it into a small, beautiful oasis. If no barrier is created, we can make it one of the most beautiful places in the world.\nQ: A NUMBER OF OREGONIANS HAVE EXPRESSED A CONCERN, HOWEVER, THAT YOU WILL EVENTUALLY ATTRACT UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THIS CITY AND THAT IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU CALL ALL 350,000 OF YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COME HERE TO LIVE.\nA: I may.\nQ: YOU MAY?\nA: Yes.\nQ: WHEN?\nA: Anytime. Tell the Oregonians that their fear is perfectly right. Tremble. Have nightmares. I can call my followers anytime.\nQ: AND YOU MAY DO IT.\nA: But I may not.\nQ: SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT THIS LAND SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT THAT MANY PEOPLE, THAT IT WOULD HURT THE LAND IF THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVED HERE. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT?\nA: The people who say these things, have they ever come here? Just four years ago there was no water. We managed two big lakes, small ponds all around, enough water. And we can create more lakes, more water. We can make more land ready to be cultivated. It is only a question of effort, devotion, and the joy of creation. Those people are simply jealous, lazy, lousy, and nothing else. And it is our problem, not their problem. If my people die because the water is not enough, the land cannot support them, then it is my problem, not their problem. I will not come to them for help.\nQ: WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU ENGENDER SUCH HOSTILITY ON THE PART OF YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OTHER OREGONIANS?\nA: There are no neighbors. We are alone here, and we want to be alone here. Q: PEOPLE IN NEARBY TOWNS.…\nA: We don't want even to relate.\nQ: WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS THIS HOSTILITY?\nA: It is not hostility. It is simply that we want to be left alone.\nQ: NO, ON THE PART OF SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OREGON, SOME OREGONIANS.\nA: Now, that is their problem, and you have to ask them. We don't have any hostility towards them. All that we want is to be left alone to do our thing. They are hostile because this land was there, available, for fifty years, and they could not make anything out of it. And within four years we have made a beautiful place where five thousand people are joyously living, luxuriously and comfortably living. They are simply jealous and hostile because they know we\ncan manage one hundred thousand people here. And to them, number is power. To us, there is no question of any trip for power.\nQ: ISN'T IT REALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE DIFFERENT THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU? THAT PEOPLE DRESS ALIKE, WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED, WEAR BEADS?\nA: There are so many reasons besides. There was a time when the Christians were treated by the Jews the same way. Just to be a Christian was enough to be a criminal.\nQ: WHY DO YOUR PEOPLE WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED? WHY DO THE PEOPLE here WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED AND BEADS?\nA: I want them to be recognized by me, and by other people. I want them to face the world... that they have dropped out of it. I want them to be clearly individual. They don't belong to this rotten world around. The day I see that there is no need, they will be using all colored clothes. It is nothing spiritual, nothing religious; it is simply an identification card put all over the body.\nQ: THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE WHO HAVE ACCUSED YOU AND THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE OF OBSCURING THE LINE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. IS THIS A RELIGIOUS CITY, OR IS IT A CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SHOULD QUALIFY FOR SCHOOL AID? WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE?\nA: This is not a religious city. The city has its own functions, religion has nothing to do with it. Religion is an individual phenomenon. It has nothing to do with the streets, the houses, the maintenance of the city. Religion is purely individual. The city is taking care of the collectivity of the community. They are two separate dimensions. They don't overlap, they don't meet anywhere.\nQ: BUT EVERYBODY LIVING HERE BELIEVES AND FOLLOWS YOU.\nA: Nobody follows me because I don't have any followers. If somebody is walking behind me, that does not mean he is a follower. If somebody feels that what I am saying is true and experiences it as true, what does the city have to do with it? The truth of the individuals living in this city is their private experience. The city is for other purposes, mundane. It has nothing to do with religion.\nWhat I am saying is true only about Rajneeshpuram, that there is no mixing of state and religion. About the outside world that is not true. Everywhere else state and religion are mixed. Otherwise, why should the Bible be there in the court for\nsomebody to take an oath? What does it mean? Every Bible should be thrown out of every court. It is mixing religion.…\nAnd do you think the people who are presidents, premiers, governors, are not prejudiced in favor of some religion? Are they capable of discriminating, so that when they are in the office they are no longer Christians? It has not been our experience here.\nQ: LET ME GO BACK, IF I CAN, A NUMBER OF YEARS, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT IT. WHY DID YOU LEAVE INDIA?\nA: For health reasons. I never wanted to leave. India may be poor, may have its troubles and problems, but it has a beauty of its own.\nQ: THERE WERE STORIES AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE FORCED OUT. IS THAT TRUE?\nA: That is nonsense. I can go back there. Nobody can force me out of anywhere. If Oregonians cannot force me out of Oregon, do you think Indians can force me out of India?\nQ: DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE OREGON?\nA: No, I never plan anything. But I can leave any day. Or I may not leave ever.\nQ: DO YOU THINK THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IS HOPING YOU WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY?\nA: They are waiting, perhaps. They can wait... and if I don't want to leave, I will not leave. I will go on fighting to the end. I will not leave. If I want to leave -- even if the whole of America begs me to stay here -- I'm not going to stay a single moment. Nobody forced me out of India. In India I was living with my commune, ten thousand sannyasins were living with me. It was my health that was getting worse and worse.\nQ: ARE YOU RECOVERED NOW? ARE YOU BETTER?\nA: Not completely. I am feeling better, but it is just on the boundary line; at any moment a small thing, and the trouble can arise.\nQ: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU AND FOR RAJNEESHEES?\nA: I never think of the future. We are happy now.\nQ: BHAGWAN, I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT FEELING WELL TONIGHT BECAUSE I'VE STOPPED SMOKING.\nA: I knew. You must be feeling nervous. One hour more, and you will be in a nervous breakdown. Smoking is a difficult thing for people to stop.\nQ: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT, JUST BRIEFLY, OF YOUR DAILY ROUTINE, WHAT YOU DO HERE?\nA: I am a very lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's guide to enlightenment. I don't do anything. In the morning I have started talking again, as I have been doing for thirty years. I love it. It is not a lecture, a prepared speech, or anything. People ask questions, and whatsoever spontaneous response happens in me, I tell it to them. And because I am not concerned at all about any consistency, I have made it clear to my people never to say \"Yesterday you said this, and today you are saying this, and these seem to be contradictory.\" I always insist whatever I am saying right now is the truth.\nQ: YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PERSON OF CONTRADICTIONS. ARE YOU?\nA: I am. Because life is full of contradictions and I am in tune with life.\nI am not in tune with Aristotle. Aristotle, I think, is a disease. I call him Aristotle- itis. Life is very different. It is not a logical system. Now modern physics has come across facts which have baffled all the scientists because they contradict Aristotle's logic and Euclid's geometry. They have no obligation to perform according to the logic man has created. They just go on their way doing their thing in their own way. I am not a logician, and I have never claimed that I am not a man of contradictions. I am big enough, as Walt Whitman once said: \"I am big enough to have all the contradictions in me.\"\nAnd yet, there is a possibility that all those contradictions may become a deep harmony. They may not remain contradictions, they may become complementaries to each other. That's how it is in existence; that's how it should be in life.\nNow, give him his cigarettes!\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #2 Chapter title: I Change With Reality 19 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 5.]\nERICH WIDDEMAN \u0026 RAINER WEBER DER SPIEGEL\nHAMBURG, WEST GERMANY\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, BEFORE WE START, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF THINGS CLEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MA ANAND SHEELA HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT THE WAY WE LIKE THESE DISCUSSIONS GOING. WE DO A COMPLETE WRITE-UP OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID, WE EDIT IT, AND THEN SEND THE COMPLETE TEXT TO YOU OR TO YOUR CONFIDANTS TO BE REEDITED. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE... IF THEY ARE GOOD, THESE INTERVIEWS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE MUCH OF A QUESTION AND ANSWER GAME, BUT SOMETHING OF A CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSION WHICH FOR YOU IS ONE OF THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO GET RID OF A LOT OF PREJUDICES THAT MAY EXIST AGAINST YOU AND YOUR RELIGION.\nALSO, THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASKED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE, BUT STILL I APOLOGIZE FOR SOME QUESTIONS THAT PROBABLY YOU HAVE ANSWERED SO MANY TIMES.\nANSWER: No problem. You just ask whatsoever you want, and in whatever way you want. And a question may have been asked thousands of times, but I have not given the same answer again and again and again. My answer has been a thousand times different. So you need not be worried; this is my business. You just ask.\nQ: THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE BEING JUDGED BY THE PUBLIC SO CONTROVERSIALLY, BECAUSE YOUR ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME ON THE SAME SUBJECTS.\nA: But I am controversial! It is not a judgment of the public. It is the reality.\nQ: YOU SAY THAT IT IS NOT YOUR ANSWER THAT CHANGES, IT IS THE REALITY THAT CHANGES?\nA: Yes. It is reality that changes, and I change with reality. I am certainly controversial. There is nothing wrong about the public thinking me controversial.\nQ: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU ARE REALLY ANGRY ABOUT? ANY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE?\nA: No.\nQ: YOU'RE BEYOND ALL THIS CONTROVERSY?\nA: I just enjoy it.\nQ: YOUR FOLLOWERS CALL YOU BHAGWAN. HOW SHOULD PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG TO YOUR GROUP ADDRESS YOU?\nA: They have to address me as Bhagwan. Q: WHAT DOES BHAGWAN MEAN?\nA: The Blessed One.\nQ WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEANINGS OF THE BLESSED ONE, THE ENLIGHTENED ONE, AND THE AWAKENED ONE?\nA: There is no difference.\nQ: SO IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT A BLESSED PERSON IS A CONTINUOUS LAUGHTER?\nA: That's true.\nQ: AND ALSO EVERY ENLIGHTENED PERSON IS A CONTINUOUS LAUGHTER?\nA: That's true.\nQ: WOULD YOU PLEASE FOR OUR AUDIENCE GIVE A BRIEF RUNDOWN OF YOUR BIOGRAPHY AND YOUR FIRST ENLIGHTENMENT? WHAT HAPPENED? AND HOW?\nA: I don't have any biography. And whatsoever is thought to be biography is utterly meaningless. On what date I was born, in what country I was born, does not matter. What matters is what I am now, right here.\nQ: SOMETHING THAT MATTERS, FOR INSTANCE, FOR THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES IS WHETHER YOU WERE ADOPTED BY AN INDIAN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, FOR INSTANCE. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?\nA: Everything has been explained to them. All the documents have been given to them. Now it is for them to decide. If they decide against me I am going to fight up to the Supreme Court.\nQ: THAT MEANS THEY HAVE NOT YET ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION?\nA: Four years those lousy people are just sitting there, doing nothing -- no decision this way or that.\nQ: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENTS HAVE STARTED PURCHASING PROPERTY IN THE HIMALAYAS. IS THAT TRUE? DO YOU PLAN TO MOVE?\nA: No. I don't plan to go anywhere. I am going to be here. Q: WHATEVER HAPPENS?\nA: Whatever happens.\nQ: I SEE. BUT YOU ARE STILL BUYING PROPERTY IN THE HIMALAYAS?\nA: That is my Indian followers making a commune there, just as I have communes all over the world.\nQ: FOR THEIR OWN USE?\nA: For their own use.\nQ: I SEE. THAT MEANS WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU HAVE DECIDED TO FIGHT FOR YOUR STAYING HERE.\nA: I will fight to the very end.\nQ: WILL IT BE A HARD BATTLE?\nA: It is going to be.\nQ: WILL IT BE A LEGAL BATTLE, OR MIGHT THERE BE OTHER MEANS INVOLVED?\nA: I would like it to be legal, but if they force me, then everything can be involved.\nQ: THAT MEANS EVEN BY WAY OF ARMED RESISTANCE?\nA: Not from my side.…\nQ: BUT FROM THE SIDE OF YOUR SANNYASINS?\nA: No, not from my sannyasins' side either, that is my side. Q: I SEE.\nA: But if anybody tries to be violent in any way with us, we are not nonviolent people. We are neither violent nor nonviolent, we are simply human beings.\nQ: BUT IF VIOLENCE ERUPTS, YOU ARE.…\nA: We will answer tit for tat.\nQ TIT FOR TAT, JA. OKAY, THAT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION, UH, ANSWER. WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?\nA: Nothing. Just nothing.\nQ: AND WHERE DO YOU DO NOTHING?\nA: Just sitting in my room, in my chair, enjoying myself.\nQ: AND WRITING BOOKS? DID YOU WRITE ALL THESE BOOKS THAT ARE CARRYING YOUR NAME?\nA: I have never read my books. Any of my books.\nQ: AH, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE YOUR GHOST WRITERS, THOUGH?\nA: No, those are my discourses, and my sannyasins edit them. Q: I SEE\nA: And they are published, but I have never read them. What is the point? They are my words.\nQ: HOW COME JUST NOW SOMEBODY, WHOM YOU MAY KNOW, HAS PUBLISHED A THING WHICH IS CALLED The Rajneesh Bible? THAT'S A BIG TITLE FOR A BOOK.\nA: Bible simply means \"the book.\" It is not a big thing.\nQ: WELL, IT ALSO HAS AN ALLUSION TOWARDS THE FOUNDER OF A RELIGION. ARE YOU ABOUT TO FOUND A NEW RELIGION NOW?\nA: I am the founder of the only religion. All those founders were all hocus pocus. Q: WHY IS YOURS TRUE?\nA: Because I find them all... Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira -- you name the person and I will show you why he is not the founder of a religion but is simply exploiting people's gullibility.\nQ: WOULD YOU EXPLORE THAT ON JESUS?\nA: Jesus, in the first place, knew nothing of religion. He never meditated in his life. Whatever he was doing was prayer, and prayer means you have already accepted the existence of God, to whom you are praying. Your prayer is based on a belief, and all beliefs are ignorant. Knowing is something else. If you have experienced a headache, then you know it; but if the whole world goes on talking about headaches and you have not experienced it, just for etiquette's sake you may believe in it. But that belief is ungrounded.\nQ: AND THEY ALSO TAKE AN ASPIRIN.\nA: If you believe too much, perhaps you may take an aspirin. Then things become worse than before. Jesus' whole ideology is based on belief.\nQ: WHERE I SUPPOSE YOURS, I THINK...\nA:... is on experience. I don't say to my people that you have to believe in anything that I say. I explain to you my experience, you try to experience. If you\nfind it right, there is no question of believing in it. You know it. If you find it wrong, of course, there is no question of believing it, either.\nQ: APPARENTLY YOUR RELIGION DOES NOT HAVE A SET OF DOGMAS. A: No.\nQ: HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME SENTENCES WHICH MIGHT, UH, HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF YOUR RELIGION?\nA: No.\nQ: WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU TEACH SELFISHNESS.\nA: Yes, because it is natural. And I teach to be natural.\nQ: YES. LION EATS MAN... SO DO YOU TEACH THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST?\nA: It happens. It is not a question of my teaching.\nQ: WHEN YOU SAY IT HAPPENS, YOU ARE NEVER CONCERNED WITH WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD, THESE THINGS?\nA: No question of good or bad; there has never been a question of good and bad. The fittest survives. And the fittest writes all the histories and all the judgments. And, of course, he is right. Might is right; and being Germans, you will understand it better.\nQ: WELL, YOU'LL MAYBE UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL, AS YOU OCCASIONALLY HAVE STRONG PREFERENCES FOR HITLER.\nA: I love the man! He was crazy.\nQ: SO ARE YOU, YOU HAVE SAID.\nA: I am more crazy than him.\nQ: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE A BIGGER OR GREATER MAN THAN HIM?\nA: No, not bigger or greater -- just crazier.\nQ: LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED TO MA SHEELA, I WANTED TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION OF A SENTENCE IN WHICH YOU SAID, \"HITLER, IN THE END, FAILED BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY A TOOL IN THE HANDS OF HIGHER POWERS.\"\nA: Don't bring in Sheela or anybody. Just I am here; be direct.\nQ:... SHE SAID, \"ASK THIS QUESTION TO BHAGWAN, \"WHICH I HAVE NOW DONE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS SENTENCE TO US?\nA: You ask directly, don't bring anybody in. Don't make it unnecessarily complex, ask directly. Why are you afraid of asking the question directly?... Afraid of people in Germany?\nQ: NOT REALLY.…\nA: No? Then just ask directly.\nQ: THIS WAS ONLY A POLITE REFERENCE TO MA SHEELA.\nA: Don't be polite to me, because I will not be polite to you. Q: I WAS ONLY BEING POLITE TO MA SHEELA.…\nA: Ma Sheela is no more concerned here.\nQ: OKAY. THE QUESTION IS: \"HITLER WAS AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF MAGICAL POWERS. THIS IS WHY HE WAS VICTORIOUS ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN POINT.\" WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, AND WHO ARE THESE MAGICAL POWERS?\nA: Adolf Hitler was very much concerned about astrology. He was not listening to his generals, where to attack, when to attack. Rather he was listening to his astrologer, what is the right time, and what is the right place. And the generals were puzzled because astrologers have nothing to do with military science. But for five years continuously he went on winning simply because leaders of the opposite nations -- Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin -- were following the rules of military science, and he was just going according to something which is not part of military science. They could not conceive where he was going to attack. They could not conceive where they should gather their forces. Finally, Churchill had to import astrologers from India to England.\nQ: APART FROM MILITARY ASPECTS, HOW WOULD YOU JUDGE HIM MORALLY AND POLITICALLY?\nA: Morally, he was as moral as Mahatma Gandhi. Q: AS MAHATMA GANDHI?\nA: Yes, because I consider both absolutely immoral. In fact, he was more a Hindu than Mahatma Gandhi himself\nQ: IN WHAT RESPECT?\nA: In his life. In his way of living.…\nQ: BECAUSE HE WAS A VEGETARIAN...?\nA: He was a vegetarian..\nQ: BUT HE WAS NOT NONVIOLENT, AS MAHATMA GANDHI WAS.\nA: Mahatma Gandhi was also not nonviolent. Just wait a bit; let me finish with Adolf Hitler. He was a vegetarian. He was an early riser in the morning, going early back to sleep. He remained a bachelor almost his whole life -- only three hours before he died, he married. He was not a drunkard, he was not a smoker. He was a puritan in every possible way, and he lived a life of discipline, just as a saint lives in a monastery.\nYou ask me if Gandhi was nonviolent. That was a political strategy -- but he was not nonviolent. He had declared that after India became independent, armies would be dissolved. But when India became independent and he was asked about armies being dissolved, he remained silent. He was really a cunning man. His secretary said that it was his day of silence.\nQ: MAY I DRAW BACK YOUR ATTENTION TO ADOLF HITLER: IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN COMMON WITH HITLER? THERE WAS A JOKE RELATED BY MA ANAND SHEELA -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRUE. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TOLD THE JOKE OF A TIGER WHO STUCK HIS NOSE INTO THE ASS OF ANOTHER TIGER AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HE DID THAT, HE SAID, \"WELL I JUST ATE A JEW AND I WANT TO GET RID OF THAT BAD TASTE. \" IS THAT TRUE? IS THAT PROPERLY RELATED, THAT JOKE?\nA: It will be good if you don't bring Sheela or anybody in between me and you. Be direct.\nQ: DID YOU TELL THIS JOKE? IS THAT YOUR JOKE?\nA: I cannot remember. For thirty-three years I have been speaking constantly, two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. Perhaps there is no single individual alive who has spoken as much as I have spoken. So, ask the question!\nQ: DO YOU LIKE JEWS OR DON'T YOU LIKE JEWS?\nA: I love them -- what is the question of liking? I have among my sannyasins more Jews than anybody else. Almost forty percent of my sannyasins are Jews.\nQ: FROM ISRAEL, OR AMERICAN JEWS?\nA: From America, from Israel, from Europe, from Germany.\nQ: THAT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY NATIONAL, ANY RACIAL PREJUDICES?\nA: I don't believe in the very concept of nations, or religions. I don't draw any lines between one human being and another. And if I have told any joke which you think is anti-Jewish, then I have also told jokes which are anti-Hindu, anti- Mohammedan, anti-Christian. In fact, I have been telling jokes which are against me! Jokes are just jokes. They are not a philosophical standpoint.\nQ: YOU SAID YOUR RELIGION IS THE FIRST AND LAST RELIGION. SO, AFTER YOU THERE WILL BE NO MORE NEED FOR ANY RELIGION ANYWHERE?\nA: Yes.\nQ: DOES THAT APPLY TO AFTER YOUR DEATH?\nA: I say it is the first and last religion for the simple reason that I don't consider old religions authentic religions. They were pseudo. They pretend to be religions, but they were not religions.\nQ: BECAUSE THEY WERE RELIGIONS FOR THE POOR?\nA: No. Because they were religions of superstition. Not a single religion has been able to prove God's existence. Not a single religion has been able to give any proof for heaven and hell.\nQ: THAT DOESN'T MEAN GOD DOESN'T EXIST, IF YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT HE EXISTS.\nA: It does not mean that; it simply means you cannot go on worshipping something for which no evidence exists in the whole history of man.\nQ: SO, MAYBE FOR AN OUTSIDER IT IS SOMEHOW CORRECT TO PUT THE CORE OF YOUR RELIGION INTO THE SENTENCE: FIND YOUR OWN EGO, FIND YOUR OWN SELF.\nA: NO. Not your own ego, but your own being. And there is a great difference between the two. Not only different, but they are absolutely contrary to each other. The ego is the false idea in you created by the society... you are a Jew, you are a Mohammedan, you are a Nazi, you are a communist; you belong to this family, this is your holy book, this is your name. You have to remain attached to your tradition, convention.\nAll these things contribute to your ego. Out of all these your ego is created... as just a combination. Your being is not given to you by the society, church, education, family -- nobody. Your being you bring with yourself when you are born. It is existential.\nQ: IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE SAID -- AND PROBABLY HAVE DONE -- IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE SAID, \"I HAVE TO DESTROY ALL YOUR EGOS\"? -- MEANING THE EGOS OF YOUR FOLLOWERS.\"\nA: Yes.\nQ: SO, THE TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE SITTING RIGHT BEHIND MY NECK HAVE NO EGO ANYMORE?\nA: You can just look and see.\nQ: WELL, THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK LIKE IT, BUT YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON IT, AREN'T YOU? I MEAN, IF THIS IS YOUR AIM, YOUR TARGET... WHEN DO YOU, THE TEACHER, NOTICE THAT SOMEBODY'S EGO HAS BEEN CRUSHED, DISAPPEARED, VANISHED, OR WHATEVER HAPPENS?\nA: Yes. I immediately recognize it. Q: YOU SENSE IT?\nA: Yes.\nQ: DOES YOUR PUPIL SENSE IT? (To the audience): WHEN DID YOU ALL REALIZE YOUR EGOS HAD BEEN DESTROYED?\nA: My disciples are at several stages of development. Somebody's ego has completely disappeared, somebody's ego is just on the boundary to disappear, somebody's ego is still trying to survive, somebody is trying not to let it go. So they are at all stages. But I try to explain to them where they are, and where they have to move from there.\nQ: WOULD YOU AGREE TO CALL THIS METHOD OF TREATING PEOPLE TOTALITARIAN?\nA: No, because I am not giving them any orders to follow me. I am simply sharing my experience. I have not called them here, they have come on their own. It is their decision to be with me; it is not my decision that they should be with me.\nQ: SO, HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM, MAKE PEOPLE GIVE UP THE FAMILY, THEIR PROPERTY, THEIR HOME...?\nA: I don't.\nQ: BUT YOU MUST HAVE AN IDEA WHY THEY ARE COMING HERE. I MEAN, THEY GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY HAD BEFORE JUST TO BE CLOSE TO YOU. THEY GIVE UP EVEN THEIR OWN PERSONALITY, AND WHAT ARE THEY GETTING FOR IT?\nA: Whatsoever they feel around me, they are on their own accord ready to leave everything behind. But I have never told a single person to leave his family or leave his job. I am not in favor of renunciation. All the old religions were in favor of renunciation. They were telling people to leave the family, to remain celibate. They were telling people to move to the monastery. They were taking people out of the society. I have never told anybody to do anything on my order. But if, being with me, they start feeling that something is stupid that they are carrying and they drop it, that is their business.\nQ: THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE COMING FROM WESTERN CIVILIZATIONS -- FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM WESTERN EUROPE -- BUT HARDLY ANYONE IS COMING FROM YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY, HARDLY ANY INDIANS. OR AM I WRONG?\nA: India is a dead country.\nQ: MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY?\nA: Both.\nQ: ECONOMICALLY, OF COURSE, AS WELL. A COUNTRY WITH SUCH A BIG CULTURAL TRADITION, YOU CALL IT MENTALLY DEAD?\nA: It was once, but for two thousand years slavery.…\nQ: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TAX CASE, BY THE WAY? IS THERE ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT?\nA: I have no idea, because I have never paid any tax. I have no income, either. Q: YOU HAVE NO INCOME?\nA: No income.\nQ: WHAT ARE YOU LIVING ON THEN?\nA: Just my friends -- I am their guest. I have been a guest for thirty-five years continuously -- in fact my whole life. In the beginning I was a guest in my family, and after that I have been a guest in other families.\nQ: JUST ONE MORE QUESTION CONCERNING THE MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE COMING TO JOIN YOU, TO JOIN RANKS WITH YOU. I HAVE THE FEELING THAT PRINCIPALLY FRUSTRATED WESTERN YOUTH ARE COMING WHO SEEM TO BE THE MORE OBEDIENT KIND OF CUSTOMERS, WHO DON'T ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS. AREN'T THE INDIANS, FOR INSTANCE, MORE PRACTICALLY MINDED?\nA: Do you think you are an Indian? Q: NO, NO.\nA: Do you see anybody here more frustrated than you? Q: NO, NO.\nA: You go to the commune and see if you can find a single frustrated person.\nQ: NOT HERE, BUT THEY SEEM TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION.…\nA: They are dissatisfied because they are intelligent people. Only buffalos don't get frustrated.\nQ: YOU FIND A NUMBER OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY, TOO. WHY DON'T YOU ATTRACT ANY OF THEM?\nA: I'm telling you, India is a dead country. And everything which is born has to die one day. Even civilizations are born and they have to die. But it is very difficult for people to drop the corpses of the ancient past, their glory, their tradition. They go on carrying the corpses on their shoulders. They are very traditional, very orthodox, and completely closed to anything new. They have the idea that their scriptures have all the truth that is possible There is no need for them.…\nQ: WE HAVE THE IMPRESSION THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE\n-- I'LL SAY IT, I DON'T MEAN IT NEGATIVELY -- SOME KIND OF DROPOUTS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.\nA: No.\nQ: I READ A BOOK BY ANDRES ELTEN AND HE DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE FEELING THAT HE WAS DISSATISFIED COMPLETELY WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AND.…\nA: Will you call Jean-Paul Sartre a dropout? Q: WHO?\nA: Jean-Paul Sartre. Will you call Bertrand Russell a dropout? Q: IN THE WESTERN SENSE, JA.\nA: Bertrand Russell, a dropout?\nQ: IN THE WESTERN SENSE, JA, I WOULD CALL HIM A DROPOUT\nA: In no sense can you call Bertrand Russell a dropout. You give on the one hand the Nobel prize to the man, and on the other hand you call him a dropout.\nQ: WELL, LIFE IS FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.\nA: I understand perfectly what you mean. Anybody who is intelligent, is a little aware of the situation of the world, of the society, of the family, is bound to be a dropout. Dropping out is absolutely positive. If the house is on fire, you run out of it. That is not escapist.\nQ: BUT YOUR WAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO SALVATION, YOU FEEL?\nA: No, I don't say that I'm the only savior, or the only salvation, but.… Q: WHAT ALTERNATIVE WOULD YOU SUGGEST THEN?\nA: I don't suggest any alternative.\nQ: WELL, YOU CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF WHAT YOU NEW MAN.…\nA: I simply explain to them what I have experienced, and if they feel themselves somehow falling into a kind of synchronicity with me, then it is up to them. Whether they want to be with me or go back to their home... I never persuade anybody to be here; I never prevent anybody from going. It is all up to them. This commune is completely free.\nQ: BUT YET, YOU ARE TRYING TO FORM THE NEW MAN, AS YOU SAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU WROTE.\nA: I am trying to form a new man. It is just an idea, it is not that a new man can be made like a sculpture. I am just explaining what a new man should be.\nQ: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EXPLICATIONS BY LENIN, BY MARX, EVEN BY ADOLF HITLER, BUT NO ONE EVER MANAGED TO REALLY CREATE THE NEW MAN.…\nA: Because all their ideas were not right, they did not fit with existence, they all failed.\nQ: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR NEW MAN AND NIETZSCHE'S SUPERMAN?\nA: Superman is a fascist idea. A new man is not superior in any way. A new man is really the most ordinary and simple man. Just try to understand one thing: that I want man to live naturally, ordinarily, without trying to become superior, without going into a pilgrimage towards paradise. Just be here and now, and enjoy whatsoever life gives to you. Be creative, be intelligent -- but this is not\nmaking you a superman. Nietzsche's superman created Adolf Hitler and the whole stupidity that followed. The new man is not the superman.\nQ: WHAT HAPPENS IF BHAGWAN DIES? WILL THERE BE A SUCCESSOR?\nA: Who cares?\nQ: YOUR FOLLOWERS.\nA: That is up to them.\nQ: WILL THEY VOTE FOR ONE? WILL THERE BE AN ELECTION?\nA: I have nothing to do with it. The moment I die.… Q: HOW WILL HE BE CHOSEN?\nA: You have to understand me: I don't CARE.\nQ: SO YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR YOUR CHURCH?\nA: No responsibility whatsoever, because every responsibility makes them slaves. Then I am totalitarian.\nQ: ONCE YOU SAID WHEN YOU GO, \"MANY OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME.\" WHAT DID THAT MEAN IN PARTICULAR? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?\nA: When did I say it?\nQ: OH, I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SAID IT, BUT I READ IT FROM ONE OF YOUR SCRIPTS. IT WAS...\"IF I GO MANY OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME.\" DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YOU DECEASE THAT OTHERS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU?\nA: No. If you have read somewhere, you must have read wrongly, out of context.\nQ: THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE IT KEEPS CROPPING UP IN THE BIBLE, AS WELL. YOU ARE STRONGLY FOR WHAT YOU CALL DEATH CONTROL -- EUTHANASIA, ISN'T THAT THE ENGLISH WORD? -- DEATH CONTROL. A MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO GO TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO BE FREED FROM HIS BODY, THIS SORT OF THING.\nA Yes.\nQ: SO THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO KEEP TO THIS TOPIC. ALSO, YOUR FIRST ENLIGHTENMENT STARTED WITH A.…\nA: You are not keeping to any topic at all. I am trying to keep you.… Q: I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MY READERS, NOT ONLY YOU.\nA: I am not concerned with your readers. I am concerned only with the truth that I can impart to you.\nQ: WHAT'S TRUTHFUL ABOUT DEATH CONTROL THEN?\nA: Once birth control is there, death control has to be there. It is just the logical consequence of birth control. If you try to control birth, you are only trying to control on one end. What about the other end? You are preventing new children being born; it becomes absolutely necessary that people should not be just vegetating in hospitals. They want to die; if they want to die, this is their birthright. And all medical facilities should be provided to these people.…\nQ: I THINK I HAVE THE VERY POINT HERE. THE RAJNEESH TIMES QUOTED YOU JUST RECENTLY, SAYING, \"I TEACH YOU TO REALIZE SUICIDE SO THAT YOU CAN GO FOREVER.\" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE TEACHING SUICIDE AS PART OF YOUR RELIGION? IS IT DESIRABLE?\nA: I am simply saying that nothing is wrong with death. It is as beautiful as life. If you have lived, and you feel that now life has no more to give to you, and you feel that you are tired, exhausted and spent, then what is the point of forcing you to drag on because an old idiot, Hippocrates, created the medical oath for doctors that they should always try to save the man? The man wants to die; he is hanging between life and death, and they go on trying every way to keep him alive. Who are you?\nQ: WILL YOU COMMIT SUICIDE ALSO, UNDER A CERTAIN CONDITION?\nA: If I feel like it, if I feel like now there is no work for me, I will. There is no problem in it. I am Master of my own self; nobody is to control me.\nQ: AND WILL YOU ENCOURAGE SOMEONE ELSE TO FOLLOW YOU?\nA: No. I never encourage about anything. I simply explain myself, I never encourage anybody.\nQ: YOU ARE A GREAT ADMIRER OF VINCENT VAN GOGH, THE DUTCH PAINTER, THE ONE WITH THE EAR. YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE, \"HE COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAD PAINTED EVERYTHING HE HAD WANTED TO PAINT. SO TO THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS SUICIDE, NOT TO ME. TO ME IT SIMPLY SEEMS A NATURAL END. THE PAINTING IS COMPLETED, LIFE IS FULFILLED.\"\nA: Yes, absolutely.\nQ: BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO OWN A PAINTING BY VAN GOGH, IN ADDITION TO YOUR NINETY ROLLS ROYCES?\nA: No. I own nothing.\nQ: BUT WHO IS THERE TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS EUTHANASIA SHOULD BE DONE? IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION -- MAYBE NOT FOR YOU -- BUT IF DEATH CONTROL IS EXERTED, WHO SHOULD DO IT? A COMMITTEE OF DOCTORS? A LAWYER? A POLITICIAN?\nA: Politicians, certainly not. Legal experts have no business in deciding about life and death. But the medical profession should be freed from the Hippocratic oath; that their function is just to save, whatsoever the situation. They should be allowed... their function is to serve, whatsoever the condition. If the person is still capable of living a meaningful life, if he is still wanting to live, if he has still the lust for life, help him. But if a person has nothing to live for and he is telling you that it is time for him to be freed from this body.…\nQ: WELL, HE MAY HAVE REGRETTED IT NEXT DAY.\n(BOTH JOURNALISTS CONTINUE TO TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY. )\nA: You go on interfering with each other!\nQ: (FIRST JOURNALIST): BUT WE'RE SPONTANEOUS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.…\nQ: (SECOND JOURNALIST): YOU KEEP SAYING YOU HAVE NO INFLUENCE AT ALL, AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE, BUT YOU KEEP WRITING THICK BOOKS. AND YOU'RE HOLDING INTERVIEWS.\nA: I will continue, but I am not trying to influence anybody.\nQ: BUT CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU DO...? MR. TEERTHA SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, \"IF BHAGWAN TOLD ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE A GUN AND KILL MYSELF.\" IS THAT A REAL EVIL KIND OF INFLUENCE?\nA: What he is saying is his side. He is not saying that I am going to tell him, because I don't tell anybody even to drink a glass of water or a cup of tea.\nQ: THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF INFLUENCING PEOPLE, JUST.…\nA: No, I am not. I am consistently making them alert not to be influenced by me. I may be wrong. What that man has said IS HIS trust.\nQ: THERE IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY YOU. THE TITLE IS Dying for\nEnlightenment.…\nA: That's perfectly good.\nQ: JA, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL ENCOURAGED BY SUCH A TITLE, AND WHAT IT CONTAINS?\nA: No. That dying means the death of your ego.\nQ: THE DEATH AND ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH DEATH.\nA: Yes, that means the death of your ego... not the death of you.\nQ: ANOTHER THING YOU TRY TO DESTROY IS CONSCIENCE.\nA: Yes, the conscience that has been created by the society; because only that is the way to free his consciousness. And these are two different things, except in the French language. In the French language, there is only one word, CONSCIENCE for both consciousness and conscience. But they are two different things. Consciousness the child brings with himself Conscience is given by the society, the family, the educational system and everybody else.\nQ: SO, IF HE IS FREED, IF SOMEBODY IS COMPLETELY FREED OF CONSCIENCE, HE MIGHT GO AROUND AND DO REALLY HARMFUL THINGS.\nA: What?\nQ: ISN'T IT CONSCIENCE THAT REFRAINS PEOPLE FROM GOING ROUND HURTING OTHER PEOPLE?\nA: It is conscience that has been creating all the wars in the world and killing millions of people.\nQ: MAYBE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSCIENCE.\nA: All the consciences: Mohammedans have done that, Hindus have done that, Christians have done that. For three thousand years there have been five thousand wars in the world, and they are still preparing for the third, total war. This is the conscience of your presidents, of your prime ministers, of your leaders, of your popes, of your priests. A man of consciousness cannot do anything wrong. It is impossible.\nQ: IS MOTHER TERESA A WOMAN OF CONSCIENCE? I AM JUST MENTIONING THE NAME BECAUSE I HAVE A QUOTE.…\nA: Can't you find anybody better?\nQ: IT'S VERY GOOD FOR A START, THAT REMARK; AND YOU CALLED HER, BY GOD, CRIMINALLY MINDED AND IDIOTIC...!\nA: Yes.\nQ: DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY OF CALLING SOMEONE WHO DEDICATES HIS LIFE TO HELPING THE MISERABLE IN THE WORLD?\nA: The people who devote themselves to helping the miserable keep misery alive.\nQ: THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGHT IT, AT LEAST.\nA: No. They are simply exploiting the misery for their own glory. Misery can be destroyed completely, but it cannot be destroyed by Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa wants more orphans. Mother Teresa wants more poor people so that she can convert those people to Catholicism. It is sheer politics. All the religions have been exploiting and doing the same thing. I don't make any distinction between those religions.\nQ: YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE GOOD HEARTEDNESS AS...?\nA: No, not at all. I approve only of one thing: If you have plenty -- abundant life, joy, anything -- and you want to share it, and if that sharing is a joy to you, share it. It does not matter with whom you share. Whether the other person is rich or poor, Hindu or Mohammedan, Western or Eastern, if you are full of fragrance, you will share it. There is no other way. When the cloud is full of rain water, it showers.\nI do not teach serving the poor, I teach destroying poverty. And we have all the means in our hands to destroy all poverty. But the politicians will not allow, the priests will not allow, because they both will disappear with poverty, remember.\nQ: WHO IS \"WE\" -- MANKIND, OR THE RAJNEESHEES?\nA: I mean the intelligence of mankind. I am not a Rajneeshee.\nQ: I STILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD BE A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR MANKIND IF CONSCIENCE IS DESTROYED.\nA: All that conscience has done up to now has been simply ugly, destructive. We need a better concept, and that is consciousness. Consciousness is a purification of your being through meditative methods. That's my whole work. Then whatever a conscious man does is right. Then there is no question of choosing for him.\nQ: HE MAY KILL?\nA: If he feels it right, he may kill.\nQ: THAT'S QUITE FAR AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.\nA: You are not civilized. And where is civilization? Q: RIGHT HERE... IN AMERICA.\nA: Nowhere does civilization exist. It is just an idea that humanity has been hoping for. What exists is barbarism with clothes covering it, masks hiding the real faces of people. But true civilization does not exist.\nQ: DID I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY? ANYBODY WHO HAS REACHED CONSCIOUSNESS MAY KILL IF HE FEELS LIKE IT?\nA: I am saying the man who has become totally conscious cannot do anything wrong. Whatever he does is right. There is no question of choosing right and wrong.\nQ: UNREGARDING OF THE EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY...?\nA: There is no question for him. He sees where the door is, and he moves. He has eyes of his own; he does not need to borrow eyes and insight from others.\nQ: THAT MEANS, IN PRACTICAL TERMS, IF IT COMES TO THE WORST, AND THE OREGON POLICE SENDS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POLICEMEN TO SEND YOU OUT FROM HERE BECAUSE OF SOME LEGAL REASONS, YOU WOULD RESIST BY MEANS OF ARMS AND EVEN ON THE RISK OF KILLING PEOPLE?\nA: We will decide in the moment. We never plan.\nQ: BUT IF IT HAPPENS, YOU WOULD BE PREPARED TO KILL PEOPLE?\nA: No. We will see at the moment what we can do, whether it is right to stand before them with our chests open and tell them to kill us and prove that they are civilized, and prove that they are democratic.…\nQ: YES, PROVIDED THIS IS A CIVILIZED DEMOCRACY.\nA: It is not.\nQ: THE AMERICAN SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC?\nA: No society anywhere is yet civilized.\nQ: I SEE. THAT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT OF AN OREGONIAN JUDGE IF HE DECIDES TO EXPEL YOU...?\nA: I have seen their judgments.\nQ: THAT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE IF THEY DECIDE TO EXPEL YOU, YOU WOULD RESIST?\nA: I will resist, certainly.\nQ: BY ANY MEANS AVAILABLE?\nA: Certainly.\nQ: EVEN ON THE RISK OF CREATING BLOODSHED -- LIKE JONESTOWN?\nA: It does not matter. Nothing matters if somebody is being nasty to innocent people who are not doing any harm to anybody. Then, whatever happens.…\nQ: YES, IN A DEMOCRACY IT'S UP TO THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO DECIDE WHAT IS HARMFUL AND WHAT IS NOT.\nA: We will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court of America, and even if we see that.…\nQ: SO, IF YOU LOSE THERE?\nA: Then we will fight.\nQ: WITH THE ARMS YOU ARE COLLECTING ALREADY?\nA: No. We don't have arms to fight America.\nQ: SO WHAT ARE THE ARMS FOR? THEY SAY YOU HAVE ARMS FOR -- I READ THE QUOTE SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT WAS FROM A SENATOR -- HE SAID \"THEY HAVE ARMS FOR A COMBAT REGIMENT, LIKE A COMBAT REGIMENT IN VIETNAM.\" WHAT ARE THE ARMS FOR?\nA: Just two dozen arms for the police, which are declared to the government? You think they are enough to fight America? Then what is the Soviet Union doing?\nQ: YOU MEAN THE TWO DOZEN GUNS YOU HAVE.…\nA: They are just cowards.\nQ: THEY SAID IT'S ENOUGH FOR A REGIMENT IN VIETNAM, THAT'S HOW IT WAS\nA: No. They are absolutely absurd.\nQ: YOU ARE SUCH A LOVING COMMUNITY, WHY DOES YOUR POLICE FORCE NEED ARMS?\nA: We are such a loving community, that's why. We don't want this loving community to be destroyed by idiots. In these four years in this commune, no crime has happened, no drug has entered in, no theft has happened, no murder has happened, nobody has been raped... no violence. These few arms and policemen are part of the Oregon government.\nQ: JUST IN CASE A CRIME WOULD HAPPEN, DO YOU HAVE THE JUDICIAL MEANS TO DEAL WITH THEM?\nA: We have every judicial means. We have four hundred sannyasins who are legal experts. Perhaps nowhere else will you find such a big legal firm. And these four hundred legal experts are going to fight to the very end.\nQ: HOW IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS \"DEVIATION\" TREATED?\nA: Hmm?\nQ: WELL, IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS?\nA: He is just taken to the hospital. Q: AGAINST HIS WILL?\nA: Otherwise he is told to leave. If he does not want to live here in communion with people, he is free to leave. If he wants to live in communion here, and if the community feels that something is wrong in him, he goes to the hospital. And in four years, nobody has resisted, nobody has been taken to the hospital forcibly.\nQ: YOU DO PERFORM YOUR OWN BIRTH... WELL, YOUR OWN MARRIAGE AND DEATH CEREMONIES. WOULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE THEM TO US?\nA: I do not perform anything, my people do everything. I am just a non-doer, just good for nothing. My people do everything. If they want to perform marriage, they will perform marriage. If they want to perform divorce, they will perform divorce. It is up to them, their business, nothing to do with me. I am completely an outsider. Let me repeat, I am not a Rajneeshee. I don't live even in the City of Rajneeshpuram. I live outside in a guest house. I am not a resident.\nQ: WELL, AT LEAST THEY DON'T GIVE YOU DOG TAGS, LIKE THEY DO WITH OTHER VISITORS.\nA: I'm not a visitor.\nQ: WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IT SEEMS SOMEHOW SIMPLY STYLISH AND VERY COQUETTE TO SAY, \"I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COMMUNITY.\"\nA: It is true, so what else can I say? I have nothing to do. I have never performed a single marriage, I have never gone to any service for somebody who has died.\nQ: BUT IF YOU DRIVE ALONG THE STREET, THEY STAND AND CHEER.\nA: That is their business and their joy. Just now they were standing outside; I had not asked anybody to stand there, and they will be standing still, just open the door and see. And nobody is telling them. Two hours those loving people will be waiting for me.…\nQ: YEAH. YOU SAID ONCE, \"IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE A PART OF MY COMMUNE, YOU ARE TAKING A RISK.\" WHAT KIND OF RISK DOES EVERYBODY TAKE WHO JOINS YOU?\nA: The risk is of dropping all rubbish that everybody carries and thinks is very valuable -- all kinds of crap. Your religion will disappear, your nationality will disappear, your whole idea of racism will disappear. Your belief systems, your political ideologies will disappear. Here you will be just a simple, innocent human being. I believe in the individual.\nQ: INNOCENCE ALSO MEANS IRRESPONSIBILITY.\nA: Yes. It means both. It means irresponsibility to those who have been forcing responsibility on you. But in fact it means responsibility, because a person who is totally free, whatever he does he is responsible for. He cannot say, \"My commander-in-chief ordered me,\" that \"It was from the pope, what can I do?\" \"It is from Jesus, the only begotten son of God.\" He has nobody to dump anything on. All responsibility is his, so whatsoever he does, he has to take the responsibility upon his own shoulders. So to him it means responsibility, but certainly to others it will look like irresponsibility.\nQ: PERHAPS HE CAN ALSO BE MANIPULATED EASIER.\nA: Everybody is being manipulated everywhere and very easily.\nQ: NOW LET'S COME BACK TO ONE MORE PRACTICAL TERM. TWO DAYS AGO YOU WERE ASKED WHETHER YOU WERE TRYING TO SPREAD YOUR\nPOWER, OR YOUR INFLUENCE, OVER THE WHOLE OF OREGON. YOU SAID YOU WANT TO TRY TO SPREAD IT OVER ALL OF THE UNITED STATES. WAS THAT MISUNDERSTOOD?\nA: No. These are not my words. They had asked, \"Are you going to take over Oregon?\" The question is stupid, and a stupid question does not need.…\nQ: BUT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR HONEST REPLY TO THAT STUPID QUESTION?\nA: I told the person that I would love them to take over the whole world. Oregon is too small.\nQ: BUT THERE IS AT LEAST A CERTAIN RISK FOR THE OREGONIANS. I MEAN, NOT THAT YOU'D TAKE OVER THE WHOLE OF OREGON.…\nA: There is no risk for anybody from my people. Q: BUT THEY FEEL IT'S A RISK.\nA: They are just cowards.\nQ: BUT YOU BROUGHT IN TRUCKLOADS OF DISPLACED PERSONS AND DRUNKARDS AND WHAT NOT JUST TO INCREASE YOUR VOTING POWER. CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF YOUR TACTICS?\nA: We did not vote at all! They were absolutely creating the whole situation. Q: BUT WHY DID YOU BRING IN ALL THESE PEOPLE?\nA: They are still here.\nQ: JA, BUT THEY WERE NOT SANNYASINS... ARE THEY?\nA: A few of them are still here. A few of them have become sannyasins. Those who wanted to leave, they left. We brought them because we wanted to share something with them. Next year we will bring someone else. Next year... every year after our annual celebration we have enough money to share.\nQ: OR IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THIS COINCIDED WITH THE ELECTION DATE?\nA: It was just a coincidence, and we did not vote at all.\nQ: SO IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF COINCIDENCE WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THAT YOU WERE ADOPTED... WHEN IT JUST CAME IN HANDY FOR THE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES?\nA: No. It is not a question of my declaring it. I was myself not aware up to that point that I was adopted in my childhood. It was a secret pact between Swami Swarupananda and my father. They were friends. And it was just superstitious astrology. Astrologers said that if I was not given in adoption I would die, and I should be given to somebody who does not belong to my family, does not even belong to my caste, to my religion... somebody utterly a stranger.\nQ: BUT SOMEBODY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT ALL THE WAY.\nA: Only Swami Swarupananda and my father. Those two persons knew it all the way. My father is dead, now Swarupananda is the only person who knows, and who has all the documents. So when he declared, I came to know about it.\nQ: WELL, I'M QUITE AMAZED BY THAT HIGH RATE OF COINCIDENCE.\nA: It is not a coincidence. It happens in India every day. If people are told by astrologers that their children will die, it is good to let them be adopted that way they think they are going to deceive the stars and death, and everything. It is foolish, but it happens every day. And they kept it a secret pact between themselves.…\nQ: UNTIL THEY COULD USE IT, OR UNTIL SOMEBODY COULD USE IT.\nA: There was no question.… Yes, my father told Swarupananda, \"If there is any need any day, you are authorized, he is your son.\"\nQ: WE HAVE STILL TWO, THREE MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICTS. YOU PREDICTED WORLD WAR THREE FOR SOME TIME, FOR SOME UNDISCLOSED YEAR BETWEEN 1984, I THINK, AND 1999. HAVE YOU GOT ANY MORE PRECISE IDEA NOW? I MEAN, COULD YOU PREDICT EXACTLY WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN?\nA: No. It is not a prediction. Q: OR YOUR FEELING?\nA: It is simple reasoning.\nQ: A VISION.… HOW...?\nA: No. It is not a vision.\nQ: BUT HOW REAL IS THE VISION? COULD WE RELY ON IT, OR IS IT JUST AN IDEA?\nA: I don't say rely on it. I am an unreliable man. What I said is a simple, logical conclusion of the world situation.\nQ: A CONCLUSION OF WHAT? OF POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE RECENT YEARS?\nA: Yes. The political events, the nuclear weapons.…\nQ: HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR IN MIND: SDI, OR AMEX OR PERSHING, OR WHATEVER IT IS?\nA: No. It is just the whole mess in which the humanity is. And the politicians go on creating more and more weapons to kill; sooner or later they are going to explode.\nQ: JA, BUT YOU COULDN'T SAY WHO IS MORE RESPONSIBLE, AND WHO IS NOT SO RESPONSIBLE...?\nA: Everybody is responsible.\nQ: YOU GOT SOME ADVICE FOR THE POLITICIANS?\nA: One piece of advice: that all nations should dissolve into one global government. The only way to avoid the third world war is that there are no more nations, but only one world.\nQ: IN THAT CONTEXT YOU HAVE SAID YOU WERE GOING TO SAVE THE ELITE OF THE WORLD BY CREATING UNDERGROUND SHELTERS. FURTHERMORE, THAT ONLY SANNYASINS WILL SURVIVE THAT WAR, AND THAT ALL THE REST OF MANKIND WILL PERISH OR COMMIT SUICIDE OR WILL DEGENERATE INTO MONKEYS. SO, ARE THESE THE PROSPECTS OF WHAT THE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER THAT WAR?\nA: If the war happens, then only a few people are going to survive. Perhaps even they will not survive.\nQ: AND THE SANNYASINS WILL SURVIVE, YOU SAID? ARE YOU PREPARING FOR IT? ARE YOU CONSTRUCTING SHELTER, A NUCLEAR- PROOF SHELTER?\nA: The state is preventing us from making anything -- from making even a house. And we are fighting the case in court.\nQ: WELL, I MEAN, ARE YOU BUILDING BUNKERS FOR...?\nA: We will make them once our case is finished.… Q: YOU WILL START BUILDING.…\nA: We will.…\nQ: NUCLEAR-PROOF BUNKERS?\nA: We will. I would love my people to survive.\nQ: BUT, I MEAN, ARE YOU TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS?\nA: We are fighting in the court. What more practical steps right now do you want me to take?\nQ: NO, PRACTICAL STEPS AGAINST DYING IN A HOLOCAUST -- NOT AGAINST SURVIVING IN RAJNEESHPURAM, AGAINST BEING EXPELLED FROM RAJNEESHPURAM. ARE YOU PART OF THE PEACE MOVEMENT, THIS SORT OF THING?\nA: No. I am not interested in the peace movement. They have never succeeded, and they are utter nonsense.\nQ: IS IT TRUE WHEN THE RAJNEESH TIMES WROTE \"EVERYONE WHO DIES IN RAJNEESHPURAM OR WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR MILES OF ITS BOUNDARIES WILL BE ENLIGHTENED\"?\nA: That's true.\nQ: IS IT TRUE? WHAT IS EXACTLY MEANT BY TWENTY-FOUR MILES? WHY NOT TWENTY-TWO?\nA: At one hundred degrees, water evaporates. Why not at ninety-nine? It is simply a law of existence that if there is one man in the state of absolute enlightenment, his being there creates a certain vibe in a twenty-four-mile radius around him. In that radius.…\nQ: WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN BEFORE? WHEN BUDDHA DIED, OR...?\nA: Yes, Buddha also had exactly the same twenty-four mile radius. Q: WHAT ABOUT JESUS?\nA: No.\nQ: MOHAMMED?\nA: No.\nQ: OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS?\nA: None, except Buddha. Q: AND YOU.\nA: There have been many others whose names are not known; but these people, Jesus, Moses or Mohammed were not enlightened themselves. But there have been many: for example, Kabir, in India; Farid, a Mohammedan in India; Bodhidharma, an Indian in China; ChuangTzu, a Chinese; LaoTzu, a Chinese. It has happened around many people in different countries, and I have spoken on all these people. There are at least 350 books that I have spoken and I have talked about these people, their methods, what happened in their lives, and what happened in their death.\nBut these people, Mohammed, Moses, Jesus were themselves not enlightened. Jesus was a mental case, thinking that he is the only begotten son of God, thinking that he is the savior of the whole world, telling his people that he will come back to save them. And the things that he did-condemning, cursing a fig tree because he and his disciples were hungry and the fig tree was not welcoming them with fruits. And it was not the season, it was not any responsibility of the fig tree, and this man curses the fig tree. You think this man is sane?\nQ: THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION -- NOT A VERY PHILOSOPHICAL ONE, BUT A QUESTION THAT INTERESTS LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE AND READERS IN EUROPE. IN POONA YOU\nFAVORED UNLIMITED SEX AS A KIND OF BIRTHRIGHT. AND SO, AS IT LOOKS, IT WAS EXERCISED. NOW, AS IT LOOKS TO US, AND AS I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT I READ, IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER THE CONTRARY. YOU SAY SEX IS ONLY ALLOWED WITH RUBBER GLOVES AND EVEN KISSING IS FORBIDDEN. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND SO MUCH?\nA: Because of that fact of life. In Poona I had said to my people that sex is simple, natural, a joyous game... you can enjoy it; don't take it seriously. It is not sin; it is not a crime, but don't impose yourself upon anybody. Two persons willing to be together, it is absolutely their right to enjoy a sexual meeting.\nQ: BUT YOU'D RATHER SEE THAT THEY TURN IT INTO CONSCIOUSNESS, YOU SAID.\nA: Yes. I would love that slowly their meditation grows so that even while making love.…\nQ: LIKE THE CHRISTIAN MONKS IN THE MONASTERIES...?\nA: Christian monks in the monasteries have been masturbating and nothing else. Q: THEY ARE NOT TURNING IT INTO CONSCIOUSNESS?\nA: They cannot because they are repressive people. If you repress your sex, you can never become meditative. The moment you become silent, immediately sexual fantasies will come up.\nQ: IS IT A MATTER OF AGE OR IS IT A MATTER OF STAGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? I MEAN, YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT OPPOSING IT DIRECTLY, BUT YOU WOULDN'T FAVOR IT THE SAME WAY AS YOU DID IN POONA. IS THAT RIGHT?\nA: It is exactly the same as it was in Poona. Their sexual freedom is there, but a new disease, AIDS, is spreading. Now we have to take account of it, and to my people I have said that if you want.…\nQ: HOW IS YOUR OWN SEX LIFE? ARE YOU STILL ACTIVE?\nA: My sex life?\nQ: YOU WERE ACTIVE BEFORE IN POONA?\nA: I have been active all my life. But now it is enough. I'm finished with it. I enjoyed it before my enlightenment, and I enjoyed it more after my enlightenment. And I proved one traditional idea wrong: that an enlightened man cannot enjoy sex. It is something of historical importance. But now I am completely satisfied. Too much!\nQ: YOU'RE NOT A VERY HEALTHY MAN THESE DAYS, ARE YOU?\nA: I am not. My body is fragile. My back is bad.\nQ: WILL YOU HAVE TO UNDERGO ANOTHER OPERATION, OR...?\nA: Every possibility is always there, because I have allergies to many things: dust, perfume, smoke.\nQ: HAS IT BECOME WORSE FROM THE TIME YOU CAME HERE, OR HAS IT IMPROVED?\nA: No, it has improved. Oregon's dry climate has been immensely helpful. I am grateful to Oregon not to Oregonians -- my asthma has almost disappeared because there is no humidity around, and my back is perfectly good.\nQ: HOW ARE YOU MEDICALLY TREATED?\nA: I have my own two physicians.\nQ: DO THEY DO MASSAGE, OR WHAT DO THEY DO?\nA: No. Medically, if my back is bad, as it was in India... then they were massaging it, giving me traction, giving me medicines for it. For my asthma they were giving me medicines. So whenever it is needed, whatsoever is needed.…\nQ: SO YOU ARE NOT OPPOSED TO PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS?\nA: Not at all. I am absolutely in favor of all sciences, and I am against all religions.\nQ: MAY I PLEASE JUMP BACK IN DISCUSSION TO A POINT WE HAD SOME TIME AGO: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DOCTORS AND YOU SAID THEY SHOULD BE FREED OF THE OATH OF HIPPOCRATES, IN FAVOR OF SCIENCE. NOW, IF DOCTORS ARE NOT BOUND BY THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH THEY CAN DO HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, CAN'T THEY? IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT TO EXPERIMENT WITH HUMAN BEINGS?\nA: It is absolutely right. In fact, it is needed. Not to experiment with human beings is dangerous.\nQ: EXPERIMENTS WITH HUMAN BEINGS OFTEN ARE BROUGHT ABOUT AGAINST THEIR OWN WILL. SO, FOR SCIENCE ONE SHOULD SACRIFICE HUMAN BEINGS?\nA: It is not a question of sacrificing; just people like Mother Teresa should offer themselves in the service of humanity. And there are six hundred million Catholics; they should offer.…\nQ: I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT INDIA AND MOTHER TERESA, BUT ABOUT HUMAN ENGINEERING.\nA: I am also talking about human engineering. You were saying, \"Should people be forced against their will?\" No, but people can be invited. And there will be enough people.\nQ: SHOULD THEY BE FORCED TO BE STERILIZED IF POPULATIONWISE, IT'S NECESSARY, LIKE IT HAPPENED IN INDIA?\nA: If the population becomes a problem for the whole country, then it is up to the country to decide. They should vote for it, for absolute birth control.\nQ: YOU ARE FOR IT?\nA: I am not for it. I'm saying THAT country should vote for it; the whole country should decide if they want to die starving. It is up to them.\nQ: WOULD YOU FAVOR STERILIZATION...?\nA: Not against anybody's will.\nQ: NOT AGAINST HIS WILL BUT, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD YOU TRY TO PERSUADE SOMEBODY HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM BECAUSE THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN DO NOT FIT INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS COMMUNITY?\nA: I never persuade. I simply explain the situation and my people are intelligent enough that there is no need for persuasion.\nQ: DO THEY EXERCISE STERILIZATION HERE?\nA: Not a single baby has been born here in four years.\nQ: DUE TO STERILIZATION OF WOMEN HERE, OR IS IT...?\nA: Every kind of birth control method is being used.\nQ: IS STERILIZATION A VERY WIDESPREAD KIND HERE?\nA: In India it was.\nQ: AND IN RAJNEESHPURAM? A: No.\nQ: NOT MANY WOMEN ARE STERILIZED BECAUSE OF THE NOT WANTED CONSEQUENCES?\nA: No, they can use other birth control methods. There is no question.…\nQ: IS THAT THE WAY YOUR RELATION TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY WORKS? YOU EXPLAIN THE SITUATION, AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE DRAWS THE CONSEQUENCES AND DOES THE DIRTY WORK?\nA: No. Everybody has to take his responsibility. I simply.… Q: EXCEPT FOR YOU.…\nA: ... explain the situation, the consequences. And everybody has to think for himself, what he would like.\nQ: AND YOU CALL THAT NOT HAVING INFLUENCE ON THE COMMUNITY?\nA: It is absolute democracy. Nowhere does it exist except here.\nQ: I MAY BE OLD FASHIONED, BUT MY NOTION OF DEMOCRACY WAS TWO PEOPLE ARGUING A POINT AND REACHING A CONCLUSION.\nA: But when you have somebody who can see the light, then of course he is not going to grope like a blind man. Your idea of democracy is the idea of people who are blind. So blind people are arguing about the shape of the elephant; they\nare arguing about whether light exists or not. And to what conclusion can they ever come?\nQ: IF YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY DOES, IT WORKS THE OTHER WAY ROUND, TOO, BECAUSE BASICALLY YOUR COMMUNE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE EITHER. SO NOBODY IN THIS VALLEY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING.\nA: Everybody is responsible for himself. Nobody is responsible for anybody else. That's why I don't call it even a community. I call it a commune. And I make a distinction between the two words. A community is a certain kind of contract between people. A commune is open, without any contract.\nQ: JA, IT'S LAWLESSNESS.\nA: It is lawlessness, because there is no need of law.\nQ: TELL ME ONE MORE QUESTION: HOW CAN A COMMUNITY SURVIVE WITHOUT THE FAMILY, WITHOUT CHILDREN?\nA: It is surviving.\nQ: FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD, YES, BUT.…\nA: Who cares? I'm very irresponsible about the future. I don't bother at all about tomorrow. If tomorrow the whole world simply evaporates...\nQ: YOU WON'T HAVE FINISHED YOUR ATOMIC BUNKER.…\nA:... I will say goodbye. Good morning, America.\nQ: THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD FINAL SENTENCE, BUT FINALLY WE HAVE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME MATERIAL QUESTIONS. PROBABLY, AS YOU SAID, IT'S A QUESTION YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE, BUT CONCERNING YOUR ROLLS ROYCES.… WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE PREACHING SOME KIND OF, WELL, AT LEAST NOT MATERIALISTIC IDEOLOGY, BUT YET YOU ARE ENJOYING A LUXURY LIFE.…\nA: Matter and spirit are not two different things. Existence is materialist/spiritualist. It is together. There is no duality.\nQ: BUT BEING MATERIALISTIC AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS IS WHAT OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED AS EXPLOITATION. WOULDN'T YOU APPROVE FOR THAT?\nA: Not at all. I don't possess a single Rolls Royce. You are talking about Rolls Royces; I don't possess\nQ: WHO OWNS THEM?\nA: My people possess them. Q: BUT YOU USE THEM.\nA: They allow me for one hour. If they don't allow, I will stop. Q: YOU GO EVERY DAY AND SAY, \"MAY I PLEASE...?\"\nA: Every day for one hour I go for a ride, and my people allow me. I am not against riches, and I am not against LUXURY, but I am not asking anybody.\nQ: BUT WE SEE OTHERS ARE.…\nA: You were talking about the watch. Yes.… Q: IS IT ORIGINAL DIAMONDS, OR IS IT...?\nA: Are you a jeweler?\nQ: IS IT IMITATION? I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON JEWELRY, BUT IT LOOKS RATHER GENUINE. IS IT?\nA: It is not. To me, diamonds or stones are the same. Q: I SEE.\nA: I enjoy. It is beautiful; and it has been made by my people. It is not Piaget, but they have defeated Piaget. And these are all ordinary stones.\nQ: DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY COMPANIES, HOW MANY RAJNEESH ENTERPRISES THERE ARE IN THE WORLD?\nA: No, I don't know and I don't bother.\nQ: BUT NEVERTHELESS, I MEAN, YOU ENJOY A KIND OF LUXURY. WOULD YOU AGREE TO THAT?\nA: I am a perfect showman.\nQ: AT LEAST EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN THEM, IF YOU WANT TO HIRE A ROLLS ROYCE... I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.\nA: Not one? My people have managed to have ninety.\nQ: BUT IT'S VERY UNECONOMIC TO HAVE NINETY ROLLS ROYCES AND HAVING THEM IN THE GARAGE AND USE ONE EVERY DAY.\nA: We don't bother about economics, economy, future. They are going to have 365.\nQ: BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO LET YOUR PEOPLE ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THEIR WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE?\nA: That is up to them. My commune has hundreds of other cars, hundreds of buses, four planes, they have everything. It is not that only I am enjoying luxury\n-- they have everything. It is simply out of respect they will not use a Rolls Royce. And I am using it because I have tried all the cars and just by coincidence only the Rolls Royce seat suits my backbone.\nQ: AND A MERCEDES WOULDN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH?\nA: I have tried it; it was not good enough. Not even other Rolls Royces, which are far more costly. I had a Corniche; it didn't suit me. That was the costliest Rolls Royce. Then I had a Commarque -- that was the number two Rolls Royce in cost; it didn't suit me. Now I am on the third grade, the Silver Spur.\nQ: BUT YOU WOULD NOT, FOR INSTANCE, IN SPECIAL REGARD TO OUR GERMAN READERS, RECOMMEND A MERCEDES FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE WITH BACKACHES?\nA: No. I have used it. I would not recommend it.\nQ: I AM VERY MUCH IN DOUBT WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO PRINT IT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE BIG ADVERTISEMENTS IN Spiegel, YOU KNOW.\nA: You have to print it!\nQ: ALL RIGHT, WE PROMISE.\nA:... Because I love Germans. I have among my sannyasins a large number of Germans. And they are the most stable, intelligent, reliable, responsible people in the commune.\nQ: THEY ALSO PROVIDE THE MOST MONEY INTO THE FUNDS.\nA: Certainly.\nQ: AND WERE THEY ALSO THE MOST FRUSTRATED ONES BEFORE THEY CAME HERE?\nA: That I don't know, what they were.\nQ: WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BRIDGE TOWARDS CURRENT GERMAN CIVILIZATION. YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT FRUSTRATION -- THAT'S WHAT ANDRES ELTEN WROTE -- FRUSTRATION WITH CIVILIZATION DROVE THEM TO YOU?\nA: There may be some truth about it, because as man becomes more intelligent, more alert, he starts looking for any meaning in life; and he does not find it, hence frustration. Then he starts looking for some way.…\nQ: SO GERMANY IS FIRST IN INTELLIGENCE, BUT ONLY SECOND IN MAKING CARS?\nA: Certainly. You have not yet been able to create a Rolls Royce. Q: WE ARE TRYING HARD, YOU KNOW.\nA: You can try hard.\nQ: DO YOU KNOW WHO DECIDES WHO COMES COMPARATIVELY CLOSE TO YOU, WHO SURROUNDS YOU IN YOUR STUDY, IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE? OBVIOUSLY, NOT FIVE THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE CAN BE AROUND.\nA: No. Just in the morning, everybody listens to me, the whole commune together. In the evening, my secretary, Sheela, comes if there is any problem for which she needs guidance from me. In the day, Vivek, another sannyasin, takes care of my food. She comes only when I give her a call to bring my food or my tea. Otherwise, I remain completely alone.\nQ: DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHY THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING YOU TONIGHT?\nA: No. That is the decision of Isabel. People who are editing, people who are part of the publicity department, people who are in some way concerned with our magazine, with our newspaper, with our newsletter; these are the people Isabel has collected because they need to be here.\nQ: IN YOUR BIBLE YOU TOLD A VERY NICE AND VERY MOVING LITTLE STORY ABOUT A BILLIONAIRE -- AN OLD MAN OF SIXTY-FOUR OR SO -- WHO TRIED TO JOIN THE MOVEMENT OR TO JOIN THE COMMUNE, AND THEN HE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH HIS FAMILY, AND THIS SORT OF THING. THIS WAS IN DECEMBER, 1984. HAS HE JOINED NOW?\nA: This morning I told this story you are mentioning?\nQ: I CAN'T RECALL HIS NAME, BUT IT'S A LONG EPISODE IN The Rajneesh\nBible.\nA: I am such a materialist, the moment you said millionaire, billionaire, then I immediately remembered it. He was here. He still comes every month almost. His family is much disturbed, because he is the head of the family and head of the businesses and corporations, and they are naturally worried that if he becomes a sannyasin, he may start donating to my Rolls Royce collection. But nobody is interested in converting him to be a sannyasin. In fact, he was amazed that nobody had even asked him to be a sannyasin.\nFor almost one year he has been coming here. His family is worried. Here nobody is bothered, here nobody takes any interest in anybody's personal life: why you are not a sannyasin, why you don't become a sannyasin. If you have been coming for one year continuously and doing all the groups and the therapies, you must be somehow thinking of becoming a sannyasin. Even that is not asked.\nQ: JUST LET ME ASK ONE LAST QUESTION I ASKED SHEELA BEFORE:\nA: You drop that Sheela completely.…\nQ: NO, I'M NOT ASKING HER, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU THE SIMILAR THING BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT.…\nA: You just ask directly.\nQ: YES. WHY IS IT YOU HAVE ONLY WOMEN IN YOUR INNER CIRCLE, IN YOUR INNER POWER CIRCLE? ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE MORE INTELLIGENT, OR THAT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MEN, AS SHEELA PUT IT? OR IS THERE ANY OTHER REASON FOR IT?\nA: There are many reasons. The woman is not more intelligent than man. But because the woman has not been allowed to use her intelligence for centuries...\nQ: SHE KEPT IT FRESH.…\nA:... she has kept it fresh. That's why she looks superior and better and more capable. Otherwise, there is no question. It is just a land which has not been used, not been cultivated. She gives better crops, and woman has always been symbolized by the earth. That's why the husband -- the word HUSBAND simply means the cultivator.\nBecause women have suffered for centuries, I would like to compensate. Man has done sheer inhumanity to women. They have been treated worse than cattle. So in my commune, I have allowed them to express and come up with their whole potential. One thing is certain, that they are more loving.\nQ: CLEVER?\nA: More loving. And as far as religion is concerned, a loving person has more possibility to grow than a man who is stuck in his head with logic, ideas, philosophies. The woman is free. If she falls in love, she is more courageous than any man. And to be with a Master is a kind of love affair. For men, for women, it makes no difference. These people love me.\nQ: BUT NOT IN THE REAL SENSE OF THE WORD.\nA: In the real sense of the word.\nQ: NOT ONLY PHILOSOPHICALLY... I\nA: Not in the unreal sense of the word to which you are accustomed.\nQ: YOU SAID ONCE THAT DEATH WOULD BE A NEW DOOR OPENING WITH THE WHOLE LIFE CONDENSED, A NEW DIMENSION OPENING. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ATTACK VERY SHARPLY ANY CHRISTIAN OR ANY OTHER BELIEF OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NEW DIMENSION OPENING AFTER DEATH, AND LIFE AFTER DEATH?\nA: The difference is that I am not saying that you have to believe in it. I am saying it is my experience. I am not telling you either to believe or disbelieve. I am simply telling you my experience and continuously insisting side by side that you are not to believe in anything. I remember my past lives, so I know absolutely that life goes on and on. There is no end to life. It only changes the bodies.\nQ: WHICH PAST LIVES DO YOU REMEMBER, AND WHICH ONES DO YOU LIKE BEST NOW?\nA: The best is this moment.\nQ: AND WHICH ONES DO YOU REMEMBER?\nA: I remember many: sometimes fragments, sometimes a few incidents, sometimes the whole series. But it is pointless.\nQ: TELL US SOME.…\nA: It will be meaningless.\nQ: BUT WE ARE CURIOUS.\nA: I am not curious.\nQ: IF IT'S MEANINGLESS, IT DOESN'T... THE SAME AS SO MANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS.…\nA: No, because those will be simply stories for you. What is the point?\nQ: WELL, IF NOTHING IS THE POINT OF ANYTHING -- WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF YOUR RELIGION -- YOU ARE COMPLETELY UNATTACKABLE.…\nA: I am.…\nQ: WE QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT.\nA: ... completely unattackable -- because there is no point, no principle, no dogma. I will attack everybody and nobody can attack me. That is simply true.\n(THE JOURNALISTS' TAPE RECORDER CLICKS OFF. )\nQ: GOOD! NOW THAT WAS A COINCIDENCE.\nA: This is a coincidence, right.\nQ: NO MORE QUESTIONS, THANK YOU.\nA: Good.\nQ: IT HAS BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU.\nA: I enjoyed it.\nQ: WE DIDN'T GET ENLIGHTENED, BUT WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED WITH OUR INTERVIEW.…\nA: One day you will get enlightened too. Q: HOPEFULLY.…\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #3 Chapter title: The Fruits Are Ripe 20 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 8.]\nWORLD PRESS CONFERENCE OPEN FORUM\nRAJNEESH MANDIR RAJNEESHPURAM OREGON\nSALLY HALE\nASSOCIATED WIRE SERVICES, USA\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, I'M SALLY HALE OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FROM PORTLAND. MY QUESTION IS THIS: CAN THE RAJNEESHEES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS IN OREGON EVER COEXIST PEACEFULLY?\nANSWER: Never. Peter Gillins\nUPI Wire Services, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, PETER GILLINS FROM THE UNITED PRESS. ON ABC'S MORNING INTERVIEW PROGRAM THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT YOU CONSIDERED YOURSELF TO BE THE GURU OF THE RICH AND YOU WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE OTHER RELIGIONS TO TAKE CARE OF THE POOR. IN LIGHT OF THAT, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY TAXES ON THE MONEY THAT YOUR FOLLOWERS GIVE YOU IN THE FORM OF DONATIONS?\nA: Nobody has given anything to me, and I don't accept anything from anybody. Whatsoever I use is loaned to me just for the time being. I am wearing this watch only for these two hours.\nQ: SHOULD YOUR FOUNDATION BE REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES ON DONATIONS? DO THE RICH NEED CHARITY -- WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS?\nA: Those rich people are intelligent enough to pay their own taxes. I don't have to take care of that. I myself have never paid any tax because my work is concerned with outcome, not with income.\nMark Haas\nKATU TV, Channel 2, Portland, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, LAST YEAR YOU BROUGHT THE POOR AND HOMELESS INTO YOUR COMMUNE, PRESUMABLY TO HELP THEM AND IN LIGHT OF THAT MY QUESTION IS, WHY DO YOU ACCEPT THE ROLLS ROYCES THAT YOU ACCEPT WHEN PERHAPS THAT MONEY MAY BE USED TO HELP THE POOR AND HOMELESS THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP LAST YEAR?\nA: I have not accepted a single Rolls Royce. Those Rolls Royces are owned by the sannyasins. And remember clearly that I am not a Rajneeshee. You can see from my clothes. I am just a guest here, and if my host feels to take care of me and enjoys it, who am I to interfere in it?\nGreg Hoy\n7 Network Australia TV, Australia\nQ: BHAGWAN, THIS MORNING YOU EXPLAINED TO US THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND HISTORY'S SELF-PROFESSED PROPHETS AND MESSIAHS. YOU EXPLAINED THAT YOU WERE NOT SPECIAL AT ALL AND THAT YOU DID NOT WISH TO PLACE YOURSELF ON A HIGH PEDESTAL. DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THERE MAY BE THOSE THAT SEE THE REGAL WAY YOU DRESS, AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW YOU, SEE YOUR JEWELED, BORROWED WATCHES AND NOW -- FAMOUS BORROWED ROLLS ROYCES AND THINK THAT YOU HAVE VERY SUCCESSFULLY PLACED YOURSELF HIGH ON A PEDESTAL, AND IT'S AN ELEVATION YOU OBVIOUSLY ENJOY?\nA: I am certainly successful. I am going to be more successful... and I highly enjoy my people, whatsoever they offer. But you must remember these are not real diamonds, and this is the cheapest, most beautiful watch in the whole world. This is made by my own sannyasins, artists, craftsmen, jewelers. The same watch from Piaget is half a million dollars. This watch, as far as dollars are concerned, is not more than one hundred dollars. But if you want me to sell it to you -- I am not going to sell it to you for ten million dollars.\nThis is a work of love, and love cannot be purchased.\nRichard Draper KOIN TV, Channel 6,\nPortland, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, TEN DAYS AGO IN THIS HALL, YOU TOLD A GROUP HERE\n-- AND I QUOTE -- \"WE HAVE TO DEPROGRAM AMERICA FROM DIRTY POLITICS, FROM FANATIC RELIGIONS, FROM ALL KINDS OF HYPOCRISY.\"HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DEPROGRAM AMERICA?\nA: America is too small a thing for me. We are trying to deprogram the whole world. I have my people around the world trying to deprogram every country, every religion, from all the conditions that have been forced upon them.\nAnd remember one thing. Don't get confused when I use the word deprogramming -- because there are psychologists who are trying to deprogram people. They are not really doing deprogramming, they are doing RE- programming. A Christian moves out of the fold, he is brought back forcibly to the deprogrammer, who reprograms him back into Christianity.\nI am simply deprogramming and then leaving you alone to your own consciousness, your awareness, and to do whatsoever your insight allows you, your responsibility feels. It is you who have to be decisive about yourself. Neither the Bible, nor Koran, nor Gita; neither Jesus, nor Buddha, nor me -- nobody is going to dominate and manipulate you like a puppet. A deprogrammed person is one who is no more a puppet, who has declared his independence from the bogus God and his prophets, messiahs and incarnations. We are already doing it. If you want to see how we are doing it, come to these people, be with these people, live with these people and you will understand it. There are things which can only be experienced. Don't be afraid, because you will be deprogrammed; only through deprogramming you will know what it is and how it is done. You are welcome.\nJon Tuttle\nKGW TV, Portland, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, AS WE UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE JUST TWO RAJNEESHEE COMMUNES LEFT IN THE UNITED STATES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE HEAR REPORTS THAT BOTH MEMBERSHIP AND DONATIONS ARE ON THE DECLINE. IT APPEARS THAT TO DATE AMERICA HAS LOOKED AT RAJNEESHISM AND SAID, \"NO THANK YOU.\" DID YOU COME TO THE WRONG COUNTRY AT THE WRONG TIME?\nA: Whenever I would have come, it would have been the wrong time. I cannot come at the right time -- in spite of all the watches given to me. I just either come before the time or come after the time.\nBut this is the fate of a person like me.\nThe message that I am giving will never fit with the existing society. But I enjoy to be a misfit. That means I am still alive. Those who have fitted completely, comfortably, are just small parts in a big mechanism. I have belonged to no\nsociety, to no country, to no religion. I will always be a misfit even amongst Rajneeshees, because I am not a Rajneeshee. It is just their love and their tolerance that they allow me to be here. Otherwise I don't follow anything of Rajneeshism.\nI can't follow anything. I simply live moment to moment. It is perfectly true. I have come at the wrong time. But that is the way, the ONLY way I can come. But we will try to change the time.\nI am not going to fit with your dead and rotten society; I am going to change it.\nQ: THE OTHER HALF OF MY QUESTION WAS WHETHER THIS WAS THE WRONG COUNTRY. WAS IT A MISTAKE TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES?\nA: All countries are wrong, because the very idea of country is idiotic. This whole earth, this whole world, is one.\nDon Lattin\nSan Francisco Examiner,\nSan Francisco, California, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ELABORATE ON TWO THINGS YOU SAID IN POONA ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS BECOME INSTITUTIONS -- WHEN BUDDHA BECOMES BUDDHISM OR RAJNEESH BECOMES RAJNEESHISM. YOU WARNED THAT ONCE A RELIGION BECOMES ORGANIZED, VIOLENCE ENTERS INTO IT. ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO BE VIOLENT; IT HAS TO FIGHT ITS WAY. I WANTED YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT, IN LIGHT OF THE WEAPONRY WE SEE AND THE SECURITY FORCES IN RAJNEESHPURAM.\nTHE OTHER THING YOU SAID ON THAT SUBJECT WHICH I FOUND VERY FASCINATING WAS \"WE HAVE TO LEARN ONE THING, NOT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE RELIGION. WHEN THE MASTER GOES, LET THE RELIGION GO.\" I WANTED YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE HERE LAST SUMMER THAT THREE COMMITTEES WERE BEING FORMED TO OVERSEE RAJNEESHISM ONCE YOU -- IF YOU -- LEAVE YOUR BODY.\nA: Your question needs no answer, because the answer is all over the place. Look at the guns around me; look at the organization of Rajneeshism -- and I am still alive, I am not dead. But I am fighting with everybody, not only the people who are not Rajneeshees. I am fighting with every Rajneeshee too.\nDon't get institutionalized. Don't become an organization; remain an organism. Whatsoever I have said is absolutely true, and you can see the organization and the guns as evidence of it. And when I am going to die, who cares what happens? Please at least let me die peacefully.\nMr. Romano Giachetti EPOCA Magazine, Italy\nQ: BHAGWAN, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, BUT I AM ITALIAN.\nA: It is great. In America, everybody is a foreigner!\nQ: I HAVE BEEN IN THIS CITY EIGHT HOURS NOW, AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF EMOTIONS, MOST OF THEM STRONG. BUT I WAS FOLLOWING YOUR LECTURE THIS MORNING AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS THAT YOU SAY THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO ITALY. MY... THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION!\nA: Just ask it. Don't say it's serious. If you say it is serious you have already destroyed its seriousness. Just say it.\nQ: AMONG THE MANY THINGS THAT YOU SAID THAT IMPRESSED ME, THERE WERE A FEW THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO A CULTURE THAT I THOUGHT I HAD LEFT IN ITALY, NAMELY THAT GOD DOESN'T EXIST; THAT ANY RELIGION THAT IS ORGANIZED MEANS EXPLOITATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AND MANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SAID. IT CAME TO ME THAT THERE WAS ONE ITALIAN THINKER, ANTONIO GRAMSCI, WHO HAS SAID MANY THINGS THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE ABOUT GOD, THE ONE ABOUT RELIGION, AND ABOVE ALL THE ONE ABOUT THE NEW KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE NEED IF WE WANT TO CHANGE LIFE ON THE PLANET. HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.\nTHE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS, DO YOU SEE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR THE BIRTH OF A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNISM, OF ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT EXIST ON THE PLANET?\nA: There is every possibility -- not only possibility, but I would say almost certainty of its happening.\nEven in a communist country, consciousness cannot be prevented from growing, from spreading; love cannot be prevented. In communist countries they can nationalize your house, your money, your other commodities, but they cannot nationalize your being. That is everywhere just the same. It makes no difference. And to bring the consciousness to its highest peak, any place is as good as any other place. The question is basically the individual's decision.\nI have sannyasins in the Soviet Union. Of course, they cannot come into the open, they are underground sannyasins. They are being persecuted, but persecution somehow always helps people to spread the message and their number is\ngrowing every day. My books are prohibited in the Soviet Union, but my people are writing them with their own hands or making typescripts, and they are moving hand to hand, from one person to another person.\nIn fact, in the basements of houses where my people meet in Soviet Russia, they are more excited than anywhere else, because for the first time certainly they are doing something that gives them their dignity back.\nCommunism has nothing to do with God, heaven, hell. Communism is an economic theory. In fact, this should not interfere with religion. Religion is not their domain, but Karl Marx is their Holy Bible because he said there is no God, there is no consciousness even. What consciousness we have is only a by- product. The moment we die, the consciousness is finished.\nThey have not explored within, they have not meditated; they have simply believed in Karl Marx, in DAS KAPITAL. So I include communism also in all the other rotten religions. That is a different kind of Christianity, a different kind of Hinduism, a different kind of Buddhism -- and they all are bent upon destroying the individual. All the religions of the world, communism included, are bent upon destroying the individual, his freedom.\nI am trying my best, even in communist countries, and the message is reaching. And the problem is not so big as it appears. Even if there are only two hundred enlightened people in the whole world, the third world war is not possible. So the work is not that big. We CAN manage it, we WILL manage it, and I am absolutely certain about it.\nJeff McMullen\n60 Minutes, Australia\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHO IS THE BETTER SHOWMAN, IN METAPHYSICAL TERMS IF YOU LIKE, YOU OR PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN?\nA: Nobody can beat me. I am the best showman in the whole history of man.\nQ: IF THAT IS TRUE, WHAT KIND OF SHOW DO YOU ENJOY? IS THIS THEATER, OR CIRCUS?\nA: This is my circus, my carnival. And I enjoy it immensely. Marilyn Deutsch\nPublic Broadcasting System, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE SAID YOU ARE THE RICH MAN'S GURU. I AM WONDERING, THOUGH. YOU KNOW OF SUFFERING ON THIS EARTH AND STARVING PEOPLE IN AFRICA. DO YOU HURT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE\nSUFFER SO AND DIE FROM STARVATION, OR HAVE TO SLEEP ON STREETS AND THINGS LIKE THIS?\nA: I know, and I know also why they are suffering there. They are suffering there because of your priests and your politicians. Still, all the religions are against birth control methods. They want abortion to be made illegal. Pope the Polack continuously says that these children are sent from God, so we cannot prevent them.\nI am not responsible for this poverty that you see on the earth. If the world listens to me, this poverty can disappear immediately. But they are listening to the wrong people, because they have become accustomed to listening to them for centuries. The Hindu shankaracharya, the Mohammedan caliph, the Christian pope, howsoever they may be different in small, meaningless matters, are absolutely together in that people should continue to produce more and more people. Then this world is going to die, naturally.\nMy few Rolls Royces -- which are not mine, I just use them -- I can give to Ethiopia. Do you think Ethiopia will be saved? If you are certain, then take all the Rolls Royces from here, and give them to Ethiopia. Ethiopia is created by the pope, and I have to sell my Rolls Royces...? What kind of logic is this?\nWhy should I bother about the people who don't listen to me, if they are starving? They are not even ready to understand me, to listen to me. This I am saying from my own experience.\nIndia... I have been there, for thirty years continuously moving around the country, a wandering teacher. Nobody is ready to listen. They are ready to throw stones at me, they are ready to throw shoes at me, they are ready to throw knives at me, they are ready to make attempts on my life, and when these people start dying I have to sell my Rolls Royces? I am not going to do that.\nWhether there is Ethiopia or not does not matter at all. What does it matter? If India disappears, it will be unburdening the whole world, bringing a little more richness. In fact this world needs one fourth of its population, and the only way is for twenty years, absolute birth control. And abortion should not only be legal, it should be rewarded.\nYou should stop giving Nobel prizes to criminals like Mother Teresa, who is increasing the world population by saving the orphans. You should give your Nobel prizes to people who can bring this whole world to one fourth of its population.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF? DO YOU THINK YOU DESERVE A NOBEL PRIZE?\nA: I do not, because what will it do -- only two more Rolls Royces...! Peter Coster\nAustralian Newspaper Service, Australia\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHY DO YOU THINK SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN ARE DRAWN TO YOU?\nA: I am not a homosexual. I am heterosexual. I love women and they love me. And what I am saying to them is absolutely appealing to them, because I am speaking against all male chauvinists of the past. I stand for absolute liberation of women from man's hold, even to the extent that there should be no marriage, because marriage is a bondage, a life-long bondage.\nPeople should live naturally just as all animals live -- no marriage, no divorce, no quarrels, no problems. Have you seen any henpecked camel? And on the other hand, have you seen any man who is not a henpecked husband?\nYou have repressed the woman, you have taken away everything from her. They were not allowed to be educated, they were not allowed to be economically independent, they were not allowed even to go out of the house, they were not allowed even to show their faces to other human beings. These people who have continuously killed the spirit of the woman are the worst criminals we have known, but they are worshipped. They are worshipped by men, because they have given men power over half of humanity.\nHere, everybody is absolutely free. If two persons feel like making love, and they agree, then it is nobody else's business to prevent them. Anybody preventing them -- any law, any court, any politician, any priest -- is simply going beyond his limits.\nMy community is a community of love. And of course, as I have said, I am the greatest showman in the world. Women are bound to be attracted to me.\nQ: I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU TALK OF PHYSICAL LOVE WITHOUT AMBITION AMONG SANNYASINS. ARE YOU CELIBATE?\nA: No. Why should I be? I am just natural, why should I be unnatural? If you want to meet celibates you go to a Catholic monastery, and you will meet celibates doing nothing but masturbating.\nI don't see that anybody can be naturally celibate. He is bound to become a pervert, some way or other.\nAnd I am a simple, natural man. I follow my natural instincts in every way. I have loved many women -- perhaps no man may have loved so many women. In the beginning I used to keep a count; then I dropped it, because what is the point?\nQ: BHAGWAN, ONE FINAL QUESTION. WHY DO YOU THINK OUTSIDE PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED BY THIS COMMUNITY OR YOU?\nA: I don't care at all. The outside does not exist. We are absolutely contented and happy herenow. They should take care of themselves. We are not hostile to them, we are simply unconcerned. They are hostile towards us.\nAnd remember one fundamental law of life. If they are hostile, they have hate towards us, sooner or later they are going to fall into my trap, because hate can turn into love very easily, just as love can become hate very easily.\nBut my people have nothing to do with them. We are not hostile to them, we are not against them, we never think about them.\nFor five years I have not seen a single newspaper. I don't read. I don't see television. I don't know what is being said about me. I don't care, because I have no desire to be a respectable great master, a messiah, a prophet. I am just an ordinary man. And I am notorious enough -- what is the point of reading it again and again?\nBruno Glaus\nWorld Press Institute, Switzerland\nQ: BHAGWAN, MY QUESTION REFERS TO THE WORLDWIDE FAMINE CRISIS. DON'T YOU THINK YOUR LECTURE THIS MORNING MAKES THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND THE CURRENT GOVERNMENTS VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY THINK ALSO. I QUOTE: \"STARVATION IS A WAY OF NATURAL BALANCE\" OR I QUOTE, IF I QUOTE IT WELL: \"HELPING THE POOR IS DESTROYING THEIR LICENSE TO HEAVEN.\" THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THEY SEE THE WORLD.\nA: They must be quoting me.\nQ: DON'T YOU THINK YOUR COMMUNITY STABILIZES, BY THIS KIND OF VIEW, THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM?\nA: No, my community is so much more intelligent that there is no need for nature to balance it. In four years' time here, not a single baby has been born. Four sannyasins have died. I am not going to overburden the earth. It is simply a way of nature to establish harmony.\nIt is in fact absolutely true that service to the poor has been the basic cause of poverty remaining for centuries. You go on throwing a few crumbs off your table, and those poor people go on hoping for more, and your priests go on telling them, \"Just wait a little. After death you are going to be in paradise.\" And in paradise, even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but no rich man can enter the gates.\nThey console the poor to remain poor. They make him happy because the rich man will suffer in hell. They make the rich man happy because their consolation\nof the poor prevents revolution. The happy rich man goes on contributing to make big cathedrals, churches, because he knows that if he can manage here, he will be able to manage there too -- if even a camel can manage, do you think Rockefeller, Morgan or Ford will not be able to manage? They are certainly far more intelligent than a camel.\nI am certainly against poverty, and I want to destroy it completely. But to destroy it completely one thing has to be understood, that all preventive measures should be taken.\nPeople who are not giving birth to children should be rewarded. People who are giving birth to children -- their income taxes should go higher and higher. People are doing just the opposite. If you have more children, you have less income tax. This is strange. The government policy is family planning, and on the other hand if the family is bigger you support the bigger family, you don't support the person who has no family.\nThese priests and politicians are responsible for keeping poverty somehow alive. They are still doing that. Send help to Ethiopia, send help to India. It fulfills the ego of the super-rich countries, and it also keeps those poor countries in a subtle, mental slavery, always dependent on you.\nIf I am listened to, it is so simple a matter. We just need one world government; we don't need any countries. We need one government, one world, and that government, that world can easily see where the problem is.\nEven a poor country like India, where people are starving, is exporting wheat to other countries. It seems we are living in a madhouse! Indians are dying, starving, and they are exporting wheat. But they have to export, because they want to make nuclear weapons. From where are they going to get nuclear plants? They need money for that.\nSeventy-five percent of the national incomes of all the countries goes to war, either fighting or preparing for fighting. If the world is one, seventy-five percent of the income of the whole world is immediately released. Poverty disappears like a dewdrop in the early morning sun.\nMa Mary Catherine The Rajneesh Times,\nRajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT POLITICS?\nA: Do I have to say?\nI curse it. It is the calamity that has made us live for centuries in suffering. Politics is absolutely unnecessary. But politicians will not allow it to become unnecessary because then they lose their presidencies, their White Houses, their Kremlins, their prime ministerships.\nPolitics is not needed, it is really out of date. It was needed because nations were continuously fighting. In three thousand years there have been five thousand wars.\nIf we just dissolve the boundary lines -- which exist only on the map not on the earth -- who will bother about politics? Yes, there will be a world government but this government will be only functional. It won't have any prestige to it, because there will be no competition with anybody. If you are the president of the world government, so what? You are not higher than anybody else.\nA functional government means the way railways are run. Who cares who is the president of the railways? The way the post office is managed and managed perfectly, who cares who is the head postmaster general?\nNations have to disappear, and with the disappearance of nations politics itself disappears. It commits suicide. What remains is a functional organization that takes care. It can be made rotary like a Rotary Club, so sometimes a black man is the head, sometimes a woman is the head, sometimes a Chinese is the head, sometimes a Russian is the head, sometimes an American is the head -- but it goes on moving like a wheel.\nPerhaps not more than six months should be given to one person, more than that is dangerous. So for six months be president and then go down the drain forever. And no person should be chosen again. This is simply poverty of intelligence that you go on choosing the same person as president again, again and again. Don't you see it as poverty of intelligence? You don't have any intelligent people? You have just one dodo to go on?\nIn one world there is no need for political parties, either. Individuals should decide individually. There is no need for any political party, it is very destructive of democracy. Although people say that democracy cannot exist without political parties, I say to you democracy cannot exist if political parties are there, because they have their vested interests.\nEach individual is free to run for any post or to vote for anybody he feels right. And whoever comes out may be far wiser than your presidents and prime ministers. Perhaps because he is going to be there for only six months, he cannot waste his time inaugurating this university, inaugurating that bridge, inaugurating this road, inaugurating all kinds of nonsense and wasting time. And the parliament is simply arguing about absolutely meaningless affairs as if they have eternity in their hands. A small bill takes years to pass.\nA man who has only six months cannot allow this stupidity. He will choose scientific advisers, experts in different fields. For example, in economics he will find all the best economic minds in the world to advise him. He has not much time. He cannot go on with third-rate politicians who know only the art of lying and nothing else. If he has to decide about education, he will ask the advice of the great educationists of the world. But right now strange things happen.…\nIn India, when I was there, in Morarji Desai's government a man became the education minister of the central government. I know the man. I have seen many\nidiots, but he is only number two -- because number one is Morarji Desai. He is the education minister. He is going to decide the whole educational system of the country.\nBut he decides nothing. The bureaucracy goes on running in the same way. They go on playing the small games of back-biting, of pulling legs, of making every effort to reach to the top. Just a single formula I give to you: one world.\nQ: MANY POLITICIANS HAVE ASKED IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS PLACE.\nA: No. Never. Who wants to fall back in all that bullshit? It was so difficult to get out of it. It took many lives for me to get out of it all -- and you are asking me again to take a dive into the bullshit? No. Absolutely no!\nEmico Franceschini La Repubblica, Italy\nQ: BHAGWAN, I AM ENRICO FRANCESCHINI FROM La Repubblica, AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER.\nA: I love Italians... except their spaghetti.\nQ: IF I MAY FIRST FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION CONCERNING COMMUNISM THAT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE ASKED YOU BEFORE. YOU SAID THIS MORNING THAT MESSIAHS, PROPHETS, INCARNATIONS OF GOD ARE CHEATING US, KEEPING US REPRESSED AND PREVENTING US FROM REBELLING AGAINST THE STATUS QUO. YOU SAID THAT POVERTY AND HUNGER ARE NOT A BLESSING. BUT COMMUNISTS HAVE SAID THESE SAME THINGS FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE POVERTY AND HUNGER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\nA: Yes, they have tried to eliminate... not poverty, but richness. And they have eliminated it. Now the whole of communist Russia is equally poor. That gives a certain satisfaction, of course, but it is not my goal. I want to destroy poverty.\nI am all for the rich man. I am the rich man's guru.\nQ: LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION. IF, AS YOU SAID THIS MORNING, YOU ARE JUST AN ORDINARY MAN, WHY IS THERE A BUDDHAFIELD AROUND YOU THAT MAKES THE GRASS GREENER, AND PUTS MORE BIRDS IN THIS VALLEY?\nA: It always does around an ordinary man. To be ordinary is the most extraordinary thing in the world. You can go around the world and you will\nnever find an ordinary man. Everybody is exceptional, everybody is special, everybody is imagining himself something big.\nI am just an ordinary man, that's why a Buddhafield exists around me. You become an ordinary man, and see.\nQ: JUST A VERY BRIEF QUESTION: SINCE TO LAUGH IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU AND TO THIS COMMUNITY, IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE ARTS, LIKE MOVIES, LITERATURE, THAT MAKES YOU LAUGH? DO YOU LIKE WOODY ALLEN?\nA: I am so happy that I am continuously laughing with my sannyasins -- and there is no reason why. Sometimes even I am surprised why they are laughing, but I join them in their laughter.\nTo me, life is not rational, it is very irrational. I enjoy everything -- except spaghetti.\nTarcisius Munaku\nWorld Press Institute, Kenya\nQ: BHAGWAN, ONE CORRECTION. I AM FROM ZIMBABWE.\nA: That's okay. From wherever you are, I am glad to see a black man. To me black is beautiful, and I am all for the black people, although they have not started coming to me; perhaps they are so poor, so downtrodden, that they are involved in their own misery.\nBut take my message to them, that I would like as many black people as possible here.\nQ: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE LACK OF FOLLOWERS WITH BLACK SKIN IN THIS COMMUNITY?\nA: The world has been divided into the East and the West. Now it should be divided between the North and the South. The South has been completely denied, ignored. It has not been able to grow in intelligence. It has the same potential as the white people of the North. Perhaps the black man has more potential than the white man.\nOne thing is certain, that black people's intelligence has not been used for centuries, perhaps never. So it is absolutely raw, unused, ready to burst forth. They are not coming to me for the simple reason that my teaching is difficult for them to understand. The poor people may turn Catholic, may turn communist, but they cannot become Rajneeshees, because the poor people have hopes with the Catholics -- yes, after life, after death -- they have hopes with the communists\nin this life. Of course it is a big bargain, but they are certainly impressed by those things.\nWhat I am saying just goes above their heads for a simple reason: you cannot ask everybody why they do not understand Mozart's music -- but what can Mozart do about it? You have to learn classical music, its delicacies -- only then you can understand Mozart. I am speaking in favor of luxury, richness in all dimensions of life. Naturally the poor, wherever they are, will not feel in tune with me. But in fact, I am the only person they SHOULD feel in tune with. I can drag them out of their poverty.\nJust look at my communes around the world. We have hundreds of communes around the world, and they are all living richly, joyously. We would like the same for you and for your country and for your people. But it is a very strange phenomenon: you tend to listen to those same people who are the cause of your poverty, your degradation, your slavery.\nIn India I have experienced it. I was talking to people to make them free of all mental bondage, all spiritual slavery, but they were turning against me, because they think their spiritual slavery is not slavery, it is something holy, a divine heritage.\nIt is very difficult. I can very easily reach people who have known the taste of richness and have found frustration in it, those who are educated and have found that all this education is worthless. It does not give you wisdom to live; it gives you only knowledgeability that can allow you somehow to vegetate.\nThe gap is big, even in India. Here you will see all white people. In India it was the same. All white people, ten thousand sannyasins from all over the world, were living with me -- but the Hindus were trying to kill me. They made attempts to kill me. Before ten thousand white people a Hindu stood up and threw a knife at me. That is their response. I can understand it, because I am speaking against their tradition, and they are so burdened with tradition they cannot imagine themselves free. (SOUND OF DOORS BANGING) Has some black man reached there?\nSHEELA: TODAY ONE OF THE PRESS PERSONS IS REPORTED TO HAVE COME WITH A GUN TO SEE IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAD A BETTER SHOW THAN HE DID, THEN HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT YOU.\nA: That's great. Shoot me before all these media people. I would not like to die in a dark dismal room lying on a bed. Shoot me! This is the right moment. I have done everything that I wanted to do, I have experienced everything that is possible to human consciousness. There is nothing to lose. Shoot me this moment. Gather courage, don't be afraid. I will tell my guards not to prevent you. My guards are not to shoot the person. Assassinate me, because Jesus missed the media... at least don't let me miss the media.\nQ: I WAS GOING TO ASK WHY -- YOU SAY IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE YOU LAST READ NEWSPAPERS, LAST SAW THE TELEVISION HOW COME YOU KNOW ABOUT ETHIOPIA IF NOT FROM THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE T V?\nA: Ask the Ethiopians. Go there. What have I to do with it and how can I answer it? Go to Ethiopia and ask those people why they have not come. That is their business, not mine.\nQ: NO, HOW COME YOU KNOW THERE IS HUNGER AND STARVATION IN ETHIOPIA WHEN YOU DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPERS, WHEN YOU DON'T WATCH TELEVISION? WHERE DO YOU GET THE INFORMATION?\nA: Just from your questions -- that's enough for me. I answer your questions, that's enough. I don't want to go into details. I have a vision of my own, a clarity. I am just like a mirror; you come before it and the mirror will reflect you. The mirror is not a photograph; the moment you are gone, the mirror is again empty. I am just an empty mirror; you ask the question -- I will respond with my totality. But my response is pure, it is not the response of a scholar. It is not out of knowledgeability, information, it is simply the clear insight of an ordinary man.\nJohn Ng'anga Thuruo\nWorld Press Institute, Zimbabwe\nA: Great. I was thinking there is only one. Two is too many!\nQ: BHAGWAN, YOU DESCRIBED PROPHETS, JESUS AND OTHER MESSIAHS AS LIARS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WHAT YOU TEACH IS THE TRUTH?\nA: I am not teaching anything, so there is no question about my teachings; nobody can ask whether they are true or not. I am teaching only methods. I don't give you any dogma, any philosophy that you can discuss and argue and find out whether it is true or not. I give you only a method. Practice the method, and you will experience what I am saying. Your experience will prove that what I am saying is truth.\nThese people here are here because they have experienced something. They have left their countries, their families, they have left everything they had, just to come to me.\nAnd LOOK at me. This is stupid; when you are asking a question, looking here and there is simply stupid. Just look at me. And listen to what I am saying, because when you are moving this way and that, you are not listening. Perhaps you are thinking that it is nothing.\nQ: I AM LISTENING.\nA: Then you must have understood what I have said -- I have no teachings, I have only methodologies. I am a scientific person; science has only experiments. I have only experiments.\nThose who are courageous enough go through the experiments, and if they find something there, it becomes THEIR truth. It is not my truth. I don't emphasize to believe in me; even the method has to be accepted only as hypothetical.\nThis is very pleasant for me because I don't have any principles. Nobody can contradict me, nobody can criticize me, nobody can say that what I am saying is not true. To say that he will first have to go through the experiments, the meditation, the silence, the joy, the blessing, and he will know. And I have never come across a single person who has followed the path and has not reached. Existence is very compassionate.\nQ: BHAGWAN, ANOTHER QUESTION. THE FOLLOWERS, YOU CALL THEM SANNYASINS, LOVE YOU SO MUCH -- I HAVE SEEN THAT AND YOU MUST BE AWARE ABOUT A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS THAT LIVED IN JONESTOWN, GUYANA, WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE SOME YEARS BACK. DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU EVER TOLD THEM TO TAKE A POTION, THEY WOULD DO SO?\nA: They love me, I love them; how can I help them commit suicide? Reverend Jim Jones was a Christian. And the whole responsibility of Jonestown's suicidal act is the responsibility of Christians from Jesus to Pope the Polack. All Christians are responsible for it because they have been teaching that all that is beautiful is beyond death. Jesus was doing the same as Reverend Jim Jones, they belong to the same category. Jim Jones was only repeating Jesus. Jesus was saying, \"You are all going to be with me, and soon I will come back and take all of you into the glory of God.\" Two thousand years have passed. The guy has not been seen again.\nNevil Aschen\nNational Public Radio, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, IS IT PLANNED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE RAJNEESH FOUNDATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL FEMALE? IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT? IS IT SOMETHING DELIBERATE?\nA: Yes, there is a reason. I love women, and I want to give them all that has been taken away from them through the whole history of man. This is just a little compensation. All the women are running this whole circus of mine, and they are doing it beautifully. And there are other reasons also.\nA man is more head-oriented. He thinks for and against. It is really very difficult for a man to say a total yes or a total no. He is a split personality. Some part of him says yes, some part of him says no.\nThe woman functions through her heart, which knows no division. If it says yes it is total, and yes is beautiful only when it is total. If it says no it is beautiful. Anything which is total has a beauty. Anything which is half and half, fifty-fifty, is schizophrenic.\nSo not only the women who are in a biologically feminine body are running the show, but also the men who are there have become more feminine than they would have imagined ever. They have become more graceful, more loving. Their heads are not more in the way, they have fallen deep into their hearts.\nIn fact, all my sannyasins are women!\nHoward Sattler\n6PR Radio, Australia\nQ: BHAGWAN, I HOPE I WON'T REPEAT MYSELF YOU HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY TELLING US THAT YOU HAVE THE GREATEST CIRCUS IN THE WORLD AND AS WE KNOW GREAT CIRCUSES TRAVEL. I WONDER IF YOU WOULD RESPOND TO STORIES FROM THE SOUTHWEST OF AUSTRALIA THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO TOUR THE CIRCUS THERE AND THAT THE CIRCUS IS GOING TO SET UP ITS BIG TOP THERE NEAR A LITTLE TIMBER TOWN CALLED PEMBERTON.\nA: Spread the rumor that I'm coming!\nQ: I WONDER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE PEOPLE THERE, PARTICULARLY THE CHRISTIAN LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEADING A LEGAL AND A MORAL BATTLE AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE OVER THERE, WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT IF THE CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN AND WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE FOR THEM?\nA: They are going to be shocked by my message. Make it clear to them that my coming to Australia is going to create an immense turmoil in the whole continent, because I don't believe in their morality -- it is all hypocrisy. I don't believe in their values, which are only a mask, and I'm going to hammer on that mask as hard as I can.\nMy whole work is to reveal your original face to you. Naturally, if you hammer on somebody's mask he freaks out, because he has been thinking that that mask is his face. So the first response to me is always that of a shock. But if he has some guts -- which I think Australians have -- if they have some guts, they will wait to see what is behind the mask. Let the mask slip and you will be surprised: your\npersonality was just mumbo-jumbo. This is your individuality, your true being, and it brings freedom with it. It brings wisdom with it. It brings a new kind of morality with it.\nSo just tell them to get ready!\nQ: WE'RE READY. THANK YOU.\nTom Senior\nKPTV, Portland, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, GETTING BACK TO YOUR WRISTWATCH FOR A SECOND. AS AN ENLIGHTENED MASTER, WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT TIME IT IS?\nA: Just for your sake. I know the heat; my people are suffering in the heat and you must be suffering too. I can continue forever. I am sitting in an airconditioned place, you are not. It is just a little bit of concern for my people and for you all who come from all over the world. I don't want you to be ascetics. I want you to enjoy Rajneeshpuram, not to suffer the heat here. Otherwise there is no problem... I can stop looking at the watch. You seem to feel offended by it. If that is so then it is great, because to offend is my whole work.\nCarlo Silvestro\nGrazia Magazine, Italy\nQ: YES, ANOTHER ITALIAN. BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SPEAK ON WHAT KIND OF LOVE IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, AND ALSO IF THERE IS ANY HOPE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE ENTANGLED IN THE USUAL PATTERN OF SADO-MASOCHISM.\nA: It is a very significant question. Ordinarily, religions have made it impossible. Any beautiful relationship between man and woman -- they have destroyed it. There was reason to destroy it.\nIf a man's love life is fulfilled, you will not find so many people in churches praying. They will be making love, early morning love, on Sundays. Who bothers about the idiot who is preaching in the church? If people's love lives are of immense content and beauty they won't bother about whether God exists or not, whether the philosophy preached in the Bible is true or not. They are so contented with themselves.\nOnce in a while it happens that I pass on the road and two lovers are hugging each other. They don't even look at me. I feel so happy; they must be in an immensely groovy place.\nReligions have destroyed your love by creating marriage. Marriage is the end, not the beginning. Love is finished. Now you are a husband, your beloved is a\nwife. Now you start trying to dominate each other. It is politics, no more love. Now every small thing becomes a point to be argued.\nAnd marriage is against human nature, so sooner or later you are going to be fed up with the woman, and the woman is going to be fed up with you. And it is natural, there is nothing wrong in it. That is why I say marriages should not be there, because marriages make the whole world immoral. A man sleeping with a woman, and they are not loving each other but still are trying to make love because they are married -- this is ugly, disgusting. This I call real prostitution.\nWhen a man goes to a prostitute, at least it is straightforward. He purchases a certain commodity. He does not purchase the woman, he purchases a certain commodity. But he has purchased the whole woman in marriage -- and for her whole life. All husbands and all wives without exception are caged, trying to get free of it. But even sometimes in countries where divorce is allowed and they manage to change the partner, within a few days they are in for a surprise. The other woman or the other man proves an exact copy of the one they have left behind.\nI remember hearing about one man who married eight times -- of course, it must have been in California. When he married the eighth time, after two days he recognized that he had married this woman once before too. And then he started thinking, \"What have I gained by changing women? It all comes back to the same rut.\"\nStability in marriage is unnatural. Monogamy is unnatural. Man is by nature a polygamous animal, and anybody who is intelligent will be polygamous. You can't go on and on eating Italian food. Once in a while you want to visit the Chinese restaurant!\nI want people to be completely freed from marriage and marriage licenses. The only cause of their being together should be love, not law. Love should be the only law.\nThen what you are asking is possible. The moment love disappears, say goodbye to each other. There is nothing to fight for; love was a gift of existence. It came like the wind, it has gone like the wind. You will be grateful to each other. You may part, but you will remember those beautiful moments you had been together. You may remain friends, if not lovers. Ordinarily lovers when they part become enemies. In fact, they become enemies before they part -- that's why they part.\nUltimately, if both persons are meditators, not just lovers, trying to transform the very energy of love into a meditative state.… And that is my whole approach towards man and his relationship with woman. It is a tremendous energy. It is life. If, while making love to your woman, you can both move into a silent period, utterly quiet, no thought passing through your minds-as if time has stopped -- then you will know for the first time the real taste of love. That kind of relationship can remain for the whole life, because it is no more just biological\nattraction which fades away sooner or later. Now you have a new dimension opening.\nYour woman has become your temple. Your man has become your temple. Your love has become your meditation, and this meditation goes on growing, and when it is growing you start becoming more and more joyful, more and more nourished, more and more strengthened. There is no relationship, there is no bondage to remain with the woman. But who can renounce joy? Who can ask for divorce when there is so much joy? People are asking for divorce because there is no joy, just despair and twenty-four hours a day nightmare.…\nMy people here and around the world are learning that love is only the jumping board. There is much more ahead of it, which is possible only if two persons remain intimate for a longer period of time. With a new person, again you begin from scratch. And there is no need for a new person, because now it is not the biological or the physical aspect of the person, but you have come into communion spiritually.\nTo transform sex into spirituality is my basic approach. And if both are lovers AND meditators, they will not mind, once in a while, if you visit a Chinese restaurant, or she goes to visit some continental restaurant! It is not a problem. You love the woman; if she is feeling happy once in a while with somebody else, what is wrong in it? You should be happy that she is happy, because you love her. Only meditators are capable of dropping jealousies.\nBe a lover -- that is a good beginning, but not the end. Go on trying to be more meditative. And be quick, because your love may be finished the day the honeymoon is finished.\nSo meditation and love should go hand in hand. If we can create a world where lovers are meditators too, then there will be no problem of continuous torture, nagging, jealousies, hurting each other in every possible way.\nLove without meditation is bound to turn into hatred any moment -- beware -- but love with meditation will become deeper and deeper, more and more intense. And perhaps two persons will feel together so attuned, a kind of at-one- ment, that they would love to be together forever.\nBut that is not a condition. Any day, even if one partner decides, \"Now I am moving from this crossroad, away from you. Thank you for all you have done. I remember all these beautiful moments, but I cannot continue\" -- that's enough. No court is needed to decide for you that you are married, to decide for you that you are divorced. What an insane world we are living in! Even our love is not free.\nAnd when I say that love should be our freedom, they condemn me all over the world as the \"free-sex guru.\" Certainly I am all for freedom of love. And in a way they are right: I don't want sex to be a commodity in the market. It has to be freely available just two persons agreeing, that's enough. And this agreement is only for the moment; no promises for the future, because they become chains around your neck. They will kill you. No promises for the future, just relish this\nmoment. And if next moment you are still together, you will be able to relish it more.\nSo I don't use the word RELATIONSHIP. I use the word RELATEDNESS. You can relate, but don't create relationship. If your relating becomes a lifelong process, good. If it does not, that is even better. Perhaps this was not the right partner, and it is good that you separated. Find another partner. There must be someone somewhere who will be waiting for you. But this society does not allow you to find out who it is who is waiting for you, who is the person who will fit with you.\nThey will call me immoral.… To me, this is morality. What they are trying to practice is immoral.\nBurt Rudman KOMO Television,\nSeattle, Washington, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, WE'RE HERE TO DO A STORY ON YOUR PERSONAL SECRETARY, SHEELA, AND I WAS HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HER, AND PERHAPS WHY IT WAS WITH SHEELA WITH WHOM YOU SPOKE DURING YOUR VOW OF PUBLIC SILENCE.\nA: You can just see Sheela: she is so beautiful. Do you think anything more is needed?\nI have chosen her as my secretary because she has lived with me for many years, and I have seen not only her physical beauty, but also her spiritual beauty. I have seen her intelligence. I have seen that she can manage this whole commune of crazy people.\nQ: SHE WAS DISCUSSING WITH A GERMAN MAGAZINE RECENTLY THE FACT THAT THE REASON THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE RAJNEESH TRUST WERE WOMEN WAS THAT BECAUSE WOMEN ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MEN. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU SHARED THAT FEELING WITH HER?\nA: That's true. Even if a man wants to function more intelligently, he will have to acquire some feminine qualities. As a man, he is just a barbarian.\nTo acquire some feminine qualities.… And just see, all qualities are feminine: love, compassion, sympathy, service, sharing -- all qualities are feminine. Even if a man wants to function at the highest peak of his intelligence, he will have to be guided by his heart.\nAnd we are suffering so much because we have ignored the heart, we have completely bypassed the heart. Our whole educational program is how to bypass the heart -- the feeling part, the emotions, the sentiments, the smiles, the tears --\nand just go directly to the head. And the head is the most insensitive place in the whole existence.\nInside the skull there is no sensitivity at all. Even if a bullet is put inside your skull or my skull, under anesthesia, and I wake up, I will not feel that there is anything inside the skull. The skull is completely insulated in a way -- it is insensitive. That's why all of science has gone in an insensitive way and has become a curse rather than a blessing.\nThe heart has to be the master, and the head has to be the servant. Just because physiologically the heart is lower and the head is higher, it does not mean that the head is superior. The superior part of your being is your heart. The delicate, the nice part, the most beautiful part, is your heart. So whenever you start moving towards the heart, the heart guides the head. Then whatever you do, you do with sensitivity.\nThat's why I said all my sannyasins are women in essence. They have accepted the heart as the master and the head as the servant. As a servant, the head is perfectly good. As a master, it is absolutely wrong.\nSwami Ramateertha\nThe Rajneesh Times, Germany\nQ: BHAGWAN, I WAS VERY SHOCKED AT HEARING YOU SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF TEST-TUBE BABIES, SAYING THEY COULD BE GENIUSES, MORE BEAUTIFUL AND HEALTHIER THAN HUMAN BEINGS. SURELY THE BEAUTY OF OUR INNER BEING IS ALL THAT MATTERS? -- OR WERE YOU JOKING?\nA: No. Very rarely I am serious, and at the time I made that statement I was very serious. I mean it -- because the man that has been created by blind nature, blind biology, has not proved a real growth for humanity. You can see it.\nCharles Darwin says that monkeys became man. But, since that time -- that must have happened a million years ago -- for these one million years man has not created anything better. Monkeys were far more intelligent; at least they gave birth to humanity. Human beings seem to be absolutely impotent. They go on creating carbon copies of themselves. This has to be stopped.\nI have heard... it happened in an office. The orders from above came that the office is too cluttered with old files -- thirty years, fifty years old -- they should be destroyed. But make sure that every file's carbon copy is kept. But what is the\npoint? Why destroy the originals?\nMan has been meeting with woman accidentally up to now. Hence, you feel shocked -- anybody will feel shocked, I can understand -- to think that a baby should not have the mother's womb, the warmth of the mother, the care of the mother, the love of the mother. But, you know, there are many other things also\nin the mother: her nagging, her hatred, her jealousy, her stupidity. He will get all those things too.\nAnd we can see, the specimens are available all over the world. This is what has come out of your relationship: Adolf Hitler is born out of your human relationship, he was in a mother's womb. Joseph Stalin is born in the same way. And all these criminals -- Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Mussolini, Mao Tse-tung, Nadirshah, Tamerlane, Genghis Khan -- history is full of these monsters. They have also come out of loving women.\nI don't trust any more in blind biology. I trust more in a conscious human being. It is better to give the birth of the child to a test tube, where we can choose the best semen, the best egg from the woman. And there is no need to be worried because they are anonymous; in fact, every hospital should have a bank. They have banks for blood; they should have banks for semen and eggs, and they should look into the best semen cell and the best egg meeting in a very clinical way -- in a test tube. They will not have the heritage of your ugly past. They will be fresh beings and we can program those eggs and the semen cells so that more health, more life, more intelligence becomes possible.\nIn each love affair the man releases millions of living cells. Only one of them will reach the female egg; he will become Ronald Reagan. They all rush -- it is really a great rush.… Millions of living beings, although they are very small and you cannot see them with your eyes -- and it is a big race, bigger than any race that happens on the earth.\nThinking of their size, the track between the semen and the woman's egg proportionately is two miles long. If they were your size, the track would be two miles long. A two-mile track... and they are fighting hard to survive, because there is not much time. They are always close to the third world war. They can live only two hours, not more than that. And only one cell reaches the egg and the egg closes. It rarely happens that two cells reach simultaneously, that's why twins are born.\nRabindranath Tagore, one of the great poets of India, was the thirteenth child of his father. The other twelve proved just idiots, nobody knows their names even. Now, it is a long blind passage. If Rabindranath's father had stopped after the twelfth child -- which seems to be a good point to stop; one dozen is enough, more than enough -- then you would have missed one of the most beautiful beings on the earth: a great poet, a great painter and a great human being... in every way beautiful.\nBut in a test tube it is so easy. Those twelve should have been discarded. We have chosen Rabindranath to be the first child -- and who knows how much more potential would have been in him if he had gotten the best female egg. Nobody knows.\nWe don't know the potentiality of humanity. Give it a chance. What I am saying is, give it a chance. It looks in the beginning inhuman. Everything new looks inhuman in the beginning.\nDo you know, when the first railway train moved from London to a nearby station, just eight miles' journey, nobody was ready to sit in it... even for free. Lunch was served, free, but nobody was ready to enter the train because the priest in the early morning said in church that God never created any railway train; this is unnatural, this is dangerous, this is inhuman. Don't sit in it.\nWhat do you think would have happened if people had stopped? There would have been no trains, no cars, no airplanes, no rockets to reach to the moon, and we have to reach to the stars. We need more stronger bodies, we need more intelligent people, and we need people who are clean of all old crap. That is possible only if we make a clinical, medical arrangement for the birth of man. I am absolutely in support of it.\nBob Chase\nKEX Radio, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY RAJNEESHEE LEADERS THAT THE REASON FOR THE VOW OF PUBLIC SILENCE WAS BECAUSE YOU HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY, THAT YOU HAD SAID IT ALL IN YOUR TEACHINGS AND WRITINGS. IS YOUR FEELING NOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NEW TO SAY, THAT THE PAST BEARS REPEATING, OR IS IT THAT YOU ENJOY THE SHOWMANSHIP IN THE SETTING THAT YOU HAVE HERE TODAY, FOR BREAKING THE PUBLIC SILENCE?\nA: Your question implies so many things.\nFirst, my silence was not because I have said everything. My silence was because I wanted to drop those people who were hanging around my words. I wanted people who can be with me even if I am silent. I sorted out all those people without any trouble. They simply dropped out. Three years was enough time. And when I saw all those people -- and they were not many, but they were hanging around my words. I don't want people to just believe in my words; I want people to live my silence. In these three years it was a great time to be silent with my people, and to see their courage and their love in remaining with a man who perhaps may never speak again.\nWhen the work was done, when those people had left, there was no need to remain silent. I am back again, and I have much more to say -- and I will always have much more to say. Even on my deathbed, or in the chair being assassinated, I will still be saying something. I will not die silently.\nAnd I enjoy talking to my people. I enjoy their response. And, of course, I am a showman. Everybody is, they just don't have the guts to say it.\nMa Prem Isabel\nPress Relations Bureau, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA\nQ: BELOVED BHAGWAN, I'M NOT A JOURNALIST, BUT I DEAL WITH JOURNALISTS ALL THE TIME. AND BEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS OVER, I HAVE A QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY ASKS ME BUT NOBODY ASKED YOU TODAY. AND THAT IS, DURING THE TIME YOU DIDN'T SPEAK, SHEELA WAS SPEAKING ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND MANY PEOPLE GOT OFFENDED WITH HER COMMENTS. AND EVERYBODY ASKS, \"HOW COME SHEELA IS YOUR SPOKESPERSON? HOW COME SHEELA MAKES THOSE STATEMENTS? SHE IS ANTAGONIZING PEOPLE.\"\nWOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?\nA: I was also very much offended by Sheela.\nWhenever she came back, I hit her hard, because she was not the way I would like her to be-really outrageous! She was falling below the standard. And I was continuously telling her, \"Don't be worried, we don't have anything to lose. We have the whole world to gain and nothing to lose. Be outrageous!\" There is a saying that \"No news is good news.\" It is only half, the other half I have to make. If no news is good news, then good news is no news! It has to be sensational. I have been sharpening her like a sword. \"Go, and cut as many heads as you Isabel, I agree. I was also offended.\nKathleen Stone\nKBND Radio, Bend, Oregon, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE OUTSIDE, NO INTEREST IN POLITICS. WHY THEN DID YOU TAKE OVER THE TOWN OF ANTELOPE, OR YOUR FOLLOWERS, YOUR COMMUNITY? AND WHY THEN DID YOU SAY YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR FOLLOWERS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD?\nSHEELA: BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CORRECTION. IT'S THE TOWN OF.…\nA: No. No need.\nQ: I'M SORRY. THE CITY OF RAJNEESH, THE FORMER TOWN OF ANTELOPE.\nA: I am not a Rajneeshee, first, you have to remember. Q: I UNDERSTAND THAT.\nA: And I have not taken over the dead city of Antelope. Q: BUT YOUR FOLLOWERS HAVE.\nA: They are not my followers either. They are my fellow travelers.\nNow, I have such a big caravan. If a few people decide to make a dead city alive, why should I interfere? They should try to find other dead cities around and make them alive with laughter and joy. That's why I said -- because the question was asked to me, \"Are you going to take Oregon?\" -- I said, \"No! It is too small a thing. I would like my people to take over the whole world.\"\nBut that was simply a joke. And I love jokes.\nPenny Allen\nEsquire Magazine, USA\nQ: BHAGWAN, A NUMBER OF YOUR SANNYASINS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY SENSE A CERTAIN RIPENESS IN THIS MOMENT. THEY FEEL THAT THE FRUIT OF RAJNEESHISM IS RIPE NOW AND READY TO BE PLUCKED FROM THE TREE. DO YOU FEEL THIS ALSO, AND IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS OF THE PRESS?\nA: Yes, they are right. And this is the right moment to declare to the whole world that our tree has blossomed and the fruits are ripe, and to invite them to come and share with us. It is true.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #4 Chapter title: Come Again And Again 21 July 1985 pm in Rajneeshmandir [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 13.]\nJeff McMullen 60 MINUTES, AUSTRALIA\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, OF THE MANY EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THAT YOU SAY, THE ONE ON WHICH I WOULD NEVER DEBATE YOU IS THAT YOU ARE AN ORDINARY MAN. HOW ORDINARY A MAN ARE YOU?\nANSWER: Extraordinarily.\nQ: ARE YOU THE NEW MAN THAT YOU SAY THE WORLD NEEDS?\nA: Yes.\nQ: DO YOU PUT YOURSELF ON A PLANE WITH OTHER GREAT MEN, JESUS, BUDDHA, KRISHNA?\nA: No. I am just myself and I don't belong to any past, past prophets, messiahs. I am the beginning of a new man, absolutely discontinuous with the past. I have nothing to do with Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Krishna, Buddha. To me they are all dead and of no use for the future new man. In fact they are the barriers for the new man to be born. I am fighting against all those fellows.\nQ: ARE YOU A GOD?\nA: No. There is no God. God is the greatest fiction created by cunning priests. The new man is not going to have any God. The new man is enough unto himself No God is needed. God is needed by retarded people.\nQ: WAS EINSTEIN RETARDED? HE BELIEVED IN A GOD.\nA: Then I will have to explain to you that Einstein was a great physicist. He was a genius, but as far as other directions of life are concerned, he was below average.\nI am reminded: he was traveling in a bus. He gave some money for the ticket, the conductor returned some change to him. He counted, and he said to the conductor, \"This is not right, you are cheating.\" The conductor counted it again and he said, \"Mister, it seems you don't know how to count.\" And this is the greatest physicist of the world.\nIt is a strange phenomenon that the great scientists are very stupid as far as religion is concerned. They are absolutely ignorant about it. Even the ordinary man is more aware of the religions. The expert is basically to be understood as a man who knows more and more about less and less. The ultimate expert is one who knows all about nothing. The religious man is not an expert. His situation is just the opposite. He knows less and less about more and more, and ultimately he comes to a point when he knows nothing about all. And that nothingness has been called nirvana. It is not ignorance, it is innocence.\nQ: LET ME TRY YOU ON SOME OTHER NOT SO ORDINARY MEN. IF I GIVE YOU A NAME, PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR WORDS OF WISDOM FOR EACH OF THESE PEOPLE: MAHATMA GANDHI.\nA: He was the most cunning politician the world has ever known. Q: ADOLF HITLER.\nA: He was the most idiotic politician the world has ever known. Q: POPE PAUL.\nA: He should be behind bars. Q: MOTHER TERESA.\nA: It is time for her to jump into a lake.\nQ: YOUR FOLLOWERS LAUGH AND YET, WITH THAT KIND OF VERY UNSETTLING RAW STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE, YOU CLEARLY DISTURB PEOPLE, WHO SEE THAT SORT OF STATEMENT AS PROFANE.\nA: I love to disturb people, because only by disturbing them can I make them think. They have stopped thinking for centuries. Nobody has been there to disturb them. People have been consoling them. I am not going to console anybody, because the more you console them, the more retarded they remain.\nDisturb them, shock them, hit them hard, give them a challenge. That challenge will bring their capacities to the climax.\nQ: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HELLS ANGELS, A MOTORBIKE GANG -- LEATHER JACKETS, HELMETS, A TERROR GANG -- HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE HELLS ANGELS RODE INTO RAJNEESHPURAM AND DISTURBED YOUR TRANQUIL OASIS?\nA: We will enjoy them. We will receive them as our guests. They cannot disturb us. Nobody can disturb us. Even if they throw an atom bomb on Rajneeshpuram, the atom bomb will have a shock, because we will be celebrating, dancing, enjoying. Even death cannot disturb us. We will celebrate it.\nWe do celebrate it. Whenever a sannyasin dies, even when my father died, we danced, we celebrated. We enjoyed a beautiful departure, a goodbye.\nSo there is no question: anybody can come, he will have an appropriate welcome.\nQ: THEN, BHAGWAN, WHY THE ARMED GUARDS AND THE PERIMETER AROUND YOUR EXISTENCE HERE? SURELY NOT ANYBODY CAN COME?\nA: Those guards are the responsibility of the Rajneeshees, I am not concerned. I don't interfere in anybody's life. I have never interfered in any way. If somebody wants to assassinate me, I am the last person to give him any resistance. I will simply welcome him. I will say, \"Glad to meet you. Shoot me and let me be free from the body and its cage.\" But if people who love me want to protect me, I am not going to interfere with their work, either. Those guards have nothing to do with me, they are managed by people who love me.\nNow, I am an outsider to both the assassin and the guard. It is between them. They have to settle. I am simply an outsider.\nQ: A TECHNICAL LIMITATION OF FILM, WE HAVE TO PUT A NEW MAGAZINE ON.\nA: Okay.\nQ: EVEN IN THE ATOMIC AGE.\nA: Okay.\nQ: HOLLYWOOD ISN'T EASY.…\nYOU SEEM VERY FOND OF THE WILD WEST, HERE IN AMERICA. DO YOU HAVE AN EQUAL AFFECTION FOR THE WILD WEST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA? DO YOU HAVE ANY INTENTIONS OF GOING THERE AND TAKING YOUR FOLLOWERS THERE?\nA: I never function through intentions. I am a man of spontaneity, so beware. Any time I can come with my whole circus. I may never come. I never decide for\nthe next moment. One moment is enough to live at one time. And nobody can get two moments together. We always get one moment, so why bother about other things? -- because while we are bothering about other moments, this moment will be gone, empty, unlived, and that is the misery of humanity. They go on thinking of tomorrow and today is disappearing.\nWe are the people who are living in the present. So it is possible. Q: BUT NOT LIKELY.…\nA: It is likely.\nQ: NOT AT THIS MOMENT.…\nA: Not at this moment. But perhaps tomorrow morning.\nQ: YOU DO LOVE THIS THEATER, YOU SAID THAT. YOU LAUGHED YESTERDAY... IT IS A CIRCUS. BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT WILL YOU TIRE OF THIS CIRCUS, THE TRAPPINGS?\nA: No, never, because it is such a beautiful circus, and changing continuously. New flowers, new seasons go on coming. I am not tired of it. And the people who make my circus are not the animals of a circus. They are the most intelligent people of this earth, the very salt of the earth. They go on creating something new every day. It is always new.\nAnd it is always new also because I never compare anything. Yesterday is gone. I don't bring it back to compare with today. Tomorrow has not come. Who cares? It is always new, fresh. People get tired because they go on comparing.\nComparison means: you have lived this thing many times, you have seen this rose flower many times; so slowly, slowly you become blind to it, you start taking it for granted. I take nothing for granted and my people take nothing for granted, so every moment we are ready for any surprise.\nThe day I left India, I informed my people to immediately prepare, that I was going to leave. It was a shock! Ten thousand sannyasins were settling there, making arrangements, purchasing houses, lands. And within twenty-four hours' notice I told them to make arrangements, that I was leaving. And ordinarily I never come back to any place that I have left in my life. So I am not tired or bored, I am rejoicing in it as much as possible. (THERE IS A SLIGHT TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH THE FILM)\nYou seem to have in Australia very ancient equipment!\nQ: THIS IS HOLLYWOOD, THIS IS FILM AS DISTINCT FROM MERE TELEVISION, MERE VIDEOTAPE. BUT THE FINAL LOOK -- YOU TALK OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS -- THE BEAUTY OF THE FILM IS STILL THE\nESSENCE, I THINK, WHICH IS WHY WE TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME. BUT WHEN WE GET THERE IT IS WORTH IT.\nA: That is good.\nQ: YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WILL NOT GO BACK TO INDIA. EVEN IF THE MADNESS WERE TO CHANGE, THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PLACE YOU WOULD BE DRAWN TO AGAIN?\nA: Nothing can be said about it. But in my whole life I have never gone back. The place I have left, I have left. So looking at my crazy behavior of the past, it is very unlikely that I will go to India. But then, one never knows. I am not a reliable person.\nQ: THAT IS YOUR MOST RELIABLE QUALITY.\nWE HAVE HAD A VERY PEACEFUL TIME HERE FOR... IT HAS ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS BUT...\nA: Come again and again.\nQ:... GIVEN THE MADNESS THAT WE PARADE AROUND IN FOR MOST OF THE YEAR IT'S BEEN VERY ENJOYABLE.\nA: Come whenever you feel like having a holiday.\nQ:... THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WITH US. YOU HAVE SO MANY AUSTRALIANS HERE ALREADY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US?\nA: I love you. I see a beautiful human being in front of me, open, available. I don't see you as a prejudiced man. I don't see you as unintelligent, and I see every possibility of growing more and more into higher and higher consciousness. I don't predict ordinarily, but I see one of my potential sannyasins sitting here in front of me.\nQ: DID YOU FOLLOW OTHERS, AS OTHERS NOW FOLLOW YOU?\nA: No. I have never followed anybody, and I have never allowed anybody to follow me. These are my fellow travelers. My sannyasins are not my followers, they are my friends.\nQ: WELL, I THINK I AM JUST A FELLOW TRAVELER TOO. I AM AN ORDINARY MAN AND I AM AN ORDINARY STORYTELLER. WHEN I ASK\nABOUT AUSTRALIANS AND YOU SAY WE ARE OPEN... I THINK WE ARE OPEN.\nWHEN SHEELA CAME TO AUSTRALIA, SHE HAS LEARNED YOUR SKILL -- FOR HOW TO UNSETTLE PEOPLE, SHE HAS MADE PEOPLE burn. IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WIN WITH THAT? WOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE SUPPORT REALLY TO SHOW...?\nA: We don't need any support. I am not a politician seeking for support. I want to share something, but that is possible only when you are shocked and disturbed in your sleep. I have to wake you up, and Sheela has been doing a good job of shaking people and waking people. She prepares the ground for me. When she has done enough, then perhaps I may come there to find people with whom I can relate heart to heart. And there are millions of people in the world who need just a little bit of shaking and they will be awake. Their sleep is not very deep.\nQ: YOU DO SEEM TO LIKE TO SHAKE THE RICH MOST. MAYBE IT IS THE JINGLE OF THE COINS IN THE POCKET YOU LIKE TO SHAKE LOOSE.\nA: The reason is that the poor man is fast asleep; otherwise he cannot tolerate his poverty. He needs deep sleep. He needs some opium given by the politicians, by the priests. His sleep is not just ordinary sleep, it is narcotic. The rich man needs no consolation from anybody. The rich man is not worried about heaven and hell. He knows he can purchase everything -- the priest, his God, his heaven, his hell -- everything can be purchased. He is not in the same situation as the poor man, he can be easily awakened. Between the poor man and me there is a great distance.\nQ: AND THE BLACK MAN? THERE ARE FEW BLACKS HERE.\nA: A few blacks have come... because they are as beautiful people as anyone. The problem is, once a person comes here and just gives us a little chance to shake him and wake him, he is not going to leave the place. So those few black people had come just for three months to live with us -- we had invited anybody to come and live with us for three months -- and they have remained.\nMany have gone, but they go on continuously writing to us that they miss us and would like to come back because for the first time they had been treated as human beings. For the first time a white man has hugged a black woman or a black man has hugged a white woman, made love to a white woman. For the first time he was not thought to be second rate. He was respected, just the way everybody else is respected. There was no discrimination.\nThe problem is, people are afraid to come, because the politicians are making them afraid. The religious leaders are making them afraid, creating all kinds of rumors, preventing them from coming here, because they know perfectly well\nthat anybody who comes here with open eyes, alert mind, is going to fall in love with this place.\nQ: IT IS VERY PEACEFUL. I SAY THAT TO YOU, THAT ANY VISITOR HERE FINDS IT PEACEFUL.\nONE OF THE RUMORS ABOUT THE PLACE IS ABOUT THAT SIDE OF FREE LOVE. IF THERE IS THIS MUCH FREE LOVE HERE, WHY THE RUBBER GLOVES IN THE HOTEL ROOMS? WHAT HAS CHANGED?\nA: It is being careful about my people. They should take every precaution that they don't get AIDS, which is spreading fast. There is no cure for it. Once you have AIDS, at the maximum you have only two years more to live. That is the maximum. Most probably within six months you will be finished.\nI would not like my people to be finished that ugly way. Love is free, AIDS is not free.\nQ: YOU ARE MORE CERTAIN ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAN SCIENTISTS THAT I HAVE TALKED TO. WHAT IS IT? HOW DOES AN ORDINARY MAN BECOME A GURU, BHAGWAN, WITH SUCH CLARITY AND CERTAINTY ABOUT THESE THINGS?\nA: Only an ordinary man can become so certain, so clear. The extraordinary man is so much burdened with his ego, with his knowledgeability, with his schizophrenic mind, with all kinds of arguments.\nI am reminded of Immanuel Kant, one of the most important philosophers of the West. A woman fell in love with him. He said, \"I will have to think about it.\" Now, you don't think about love -- either yes or no -- but Immanuel Kant is a big philosopher. He thought about it for three years and he managed to find all the arguments for marriage and against marriage. The trouble was, they were equal. After three years he went to the woman's house, knocked on the door. He had gone to say, \"Forgive me, I cannot decide. The arguments are equal, fifty-fifty.\" But the woman was not there.…\nQ: PLEASE FINISH.\nA: Let them change (THE FILM).\nQ: TALKING TO AUSTRALIANS WILL NOT BE LIKE \"GOOD MORNING, AMERICA.\" WE DON'T PLAN TO EXHAUST YOU. THERE IS ENOUGH WIT AND WISDOM AND MAGIC AND THEATER ALREADY IN WHAT WE HAVE TO FILL TWICE THE LENGTH OF OUR TELEVISION PROGRAM. BUT THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MORE SPECIAL QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BRING TO YOU, IF YOU COULD.\nA: Okay.\nQ: THE DAM THAT YOU HAVE HERE IS NAMED AFTER GURDJIEFF. THIS IS NOT THE QUESTION FOR THE CAMERA, BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IT. HE WAS ALSO A FELLOW TRAVELER ON THE ROAD. WAS HE TO YOU AT LEAST, IF NOT AN INSPIRATION, WAS HE A REMARKABLE MAN?\nA: He was an immensely remarkable man. In fact nobody else has been so remarkable in this century. But he was an ordinary man. He never claimed that he was a prophet. He lived just like an ordinary man, but he was most remarkable. His insight and clarity are just inconceivable.\nQ: HE MOVED, WHEREAS YOU SIT STILL. DO YOU THINK ONE IS SUPERIOR? HE SEEMS TO BE A TRAVELER; WHEREAS YOU ARE TRAVELING HERE, BUT YOU PHYSICALLY REST ANYWHERE. IT SEEMS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU WHERE YOU ARE IN THAT SENSE. DO YOU THINK ONE IS A SUPERIOR CHOICE TO THE OTHER, OR...?\nA: No, there is no question of any superiority. It is just with whom your heart starts beating. It is just a question of liking, loving. Somebody may like Mozart and somebody may not like. Somebody may like Vincent van Gogh and somebody will think him crazy, mad. (SOME PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO EQUIPMENT) If you are ready, I have to finish my answer.\nQ: HE STILL HAS HIS HANDS IN THE MAGIC BAG.\nA: So when he is ready, please tell me, because I don't forget anything. You can talk about things that you don't want to put on the film.\nQ: WELL, WITHOUT GIVING YOU THE WIT AND WISDOM OF YET ANOTHER ORDINARY MAN, ONE THING MIGHT BE USEFUL MAYBE MORE TO THE RAJNEESHEES, BUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE SILLY, THE TOY SOLDIERS THAT YOU HAVE HERE. I KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING IT OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU, BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME OUT OF KILTER WITH THE SERENITY OF THE PLACE, THAT PROBABLY THE MORE PEACEFUL SIDE OF WHAT YOU DO HERE IN THIS OASIS IN THE DESERT IS ENOUGH DEFENSE WITHOUT THE WILD WEST TRAPPINGS. I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO ME WHAT GOVERNMENTS AND ARMIES DO, AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE RAJNEESHEES NEED TO BE THE SAME AS THE REST.\nA: You have not been here long enough. And you have not seen... I have been attacked...\nQ: YOU HAVE...?\nA:... many times.\nQ: HERE THOUGH, OR IN INDIA?\nA: In India. Efforts were made to poison me, to kill me.\nI know, those guns are silly. In an age which is nuclear, they are carrying toy guns. But what is the harm, if they enjoy and they feel that they are doing something?\nQ: IT DOESN'T UPSET YOU?\nA: It is perfectly okay. Let them enjoy. They are toys, but what they are doing -- their love is not a toy. They cannot have nuclear weapons, otherwise they would have nuclear weapons too. Whatsoever they can. (THE FILM IS READY)\nA: I come back.…\nQ: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PICK UP ON WHERE WE WERE TALKING? A: YES.\nQ: YOU SAID THAT IMMANUEL KANT COULDN'T CHOOSE...\nA: Yes, that will do.\nQ BETWEEN ONE VERY SIMPLE MATTER OF LOVE. COULD I INTERJECT\nAND ASK YOU SOMETHING ON THAT. ?\nA: Just wait. Let me finish, because I had not finished it.\nHe knocked on the woman's door. There was no woman. An old man opened the door and recognized Immanuel Kant. Kant asked about the woman.\nHe said, \"She was my daughter, but she has been married for three years and she has two children, too. She does not live in this town anymore. What business do you have with my daughter? You go and think a little more.\"\nThinkers are the most clumsy people in the world, most indecisive. I am not a thinker. I simply SEE, and whatsoever I see I say it without bothering about the consequences. I am an absolutely open person -- nothing private in me.\nQ: THE SAME QUESTION THEN, THAT IMMANUEL KANT HAD TO ANSWER, THE YES OR NO ABOUT LOVE. ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH SHEELA? IS SHE YOUR. ?\nA: I am in love with so many women around the world. Sheela, of course, is one of them. But I cannot point out a single woman that I love. I LOVE, and my love is not addressed to anybody in particular. And I have loved so many women, I don't think anybody else could have managed it. Even Gurdjieff is far behind me in that matter. He loved many women, but not more than a dozen.\nQ: IF SHEELA IS THAT SPECIAL, IS SHEELA THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE? IS SHE THE HEIR APPARENT TO YOUR SPIRITUAL KINGDOM?\nA: No. There is no power, no kingdom. I am here. She is just a fellow traveler, as others.\nQ: IT IS A KINGDOM WITH MORE ROLLS ROYCES THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WORLD.\nA: That is true. I am a man of very simple taste. I like the best of anything -- this is certainly true. I would like this city to be in many ways the only city in the world which has that capacity. Certainly, we have ninety or more Rolls Royces. No city of a comparable membership can claim that. In every way: we don't have a single beggar, we don't have a single thief, we don't have any crime, no murder in four years -- in America, where twenty percent of the presidents are being murdered -- no prostitution.\nIn many ways this place is unique, and we are going to make it more and more unique and beautiful. Just the stupid politicians cannot understand a simple thing: that we are not doing any harm to anybody. Don't prevent us from doing things which are not harmful. But they go on, they are so afraid. The governor goes on speaking against us and we have been inviting him, \"First come and just visit. Be here and see the people and the place, then if you feel to speak against, speak against. We have no problem with that. But at least be acquainted, at least be a gentleman.\"\nQ: IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE JONESTOWN TO US.\nA: It is just exactly the opposite of Jonestown. They were death-oriented. We are life-oriented. We love to enjoy everything. They were just an unintelligent group of people -- mostly black, uneducated, knowing nothing -- following this man who was telling them that if they go with him, they will enter into the kingdom of God. We are creating the kingdom of God here. In fact, we are waiting for God to knock on our doors some day and say, \"Let me come in.\"\nWe are just the opposite. Reverend Jim Jones and his people are really the logical conclusion of Jesus and the Christian theology.\nQ: NOT THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THE POWER OF ONE MAN OVER A GROUP OF PEOPLE?\nA: That was exactly what Jesus was doing. That is exactly what the popes have been doing. That is why I say he is the logical conclusion from Jesus through all the popes and all the Christian theologians. They have all been trying to prove the power, the glory of Jesus, his specialness and his special connection with God. And if you follow him then you need not worry about the future. He will take care of you.\nHere I teach people that nobody can take care of you. I am not your savior. I am not going to help you in any way to enter into the kingdom of God, but I can explain to you how we can live here in the kingdom of beauty, love, joy. To me GOD is a dead word. It is a dirty word, a four letter word.\nQ: I THINK I ACTUALLY WOULD PREFER TO END OUR INTERVIEW WITH SOMETHING YOU SAID A BIT EARLIER, AS FAR AS THE WAY WE STRUCTURE THE BEAUTY OF SOMETHING AS YOU SAID EARLIER, RATHER THAN THE UGLINESS OF JONESTOWN. SO, AS FAR AS THE TELEVISION PART, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE MORE, IF WE CAN TURN THE CAMERAS OFF UNTIL THEY NEED TO GET A FEW MORE SHOTS OF US SITTING HERE.\nA: Okay.\nQ: IF WE COULD CONTINUE TALKING.… WAIT A SECOND, LET'S GET THESE MICROPHONES OFF\nA: Do whatsoever you want to do.\nQ: FOR OUR PURPOSES, WE ARE TRYING, I SUPPOSE, IN THE SPACE OF THE VERY CONDENSED TELEVISION PROGRAM TO GET YOUR ESSENCE, AND THAT IS AS MUCH, I THINK, THE FEELING OF WHAT WE HAVE HAD THESE THREE DAYS. IT IS TRYING TO COMPRESS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING -- FOR FIFTY-THREE YEARS OR FIFTY-THREE LIFETIMES -- INTO A SIXTY-MINUTE PROGRAM, WHICH IS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. BUT WE DID THINK THAT WE HAVE CAUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FILM SOME OF THE MAGIC AND THE TRANQUILITY OF THIS EXPERIENCE.\nA: Good.\nQ: I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING THAT I ENJOY THE CIRCUS AND THE THEATER OF IT AS MUCH AS... MAYBE THAT IS CLOSE TO A\nSPIRITUAL FEELING. BUT TO ME YOU ARE TRULY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER MET.\nA: That is right.\nQ: YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL SENSE OF HUMOR. AND WHERE DID YOU LEARN SUCH TIMING?\nA: I have never learned anything. I just go on doing naturally whatsoever I feel to do. Whatsoever I have to say, I say it, because I don't have any obligation to anybody, and I don't have any commitment to anybody. I don't belong to any party line. I am absolutely free to be funny, to be shocking. I don't even bother about contradicting myself, because to me it seems that a man who remains consistent his whole life must be an idiot. A growing person has to contradict himself many times, because who knows what tomorrow brings in? Tomorrow may cancel this day completely. And I am ready to go with life with no hesitation.\nQ: DID YOU LOVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS WHEN YOU WERE A DEBATER MANY YEARS AGO?\nA: I have always loved the contradictions, because for me contradictions have something of tremendous value. They appear contradictions to the intellect, but the deeper you go into them, you will find they are compensatory, they are not contradictions. They somehow depend on each other; if one disappears, the other will not be there. For example, if there had been no British rule in India there would have been no Mahatma Gandhi -- no possibility. If there had been no Adolf Hitler, forget all about Churchill and Roosevelt and Stalin. Life exists in such a way that it makes contradictions, complementaries. I have always loved them.\nQ: WOULD YOU BE HAPPY THEN, IF WHAT YOU INSPIRED OUT OF THIS BRIEF PART OF A VERY LONG JOURNEY, IF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO NOW FOLLOW YOU IN FACT WANDERED OFF TO SOME OTHER SPHERE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS TO THEM, THEMSELVES?\nA: I will be happy and I will bless them to go there, because they have come here to seek some truth, some tranquility, some sanity. If they feel they can get it better somewhere else, I will be the first person to send them and help them to go. I have been doing that for years. In fact, I have had to do it in such a way that they don't feel they are leaving me. Even against their will, I had to bless them and tell them to go. I knew that they loved me, but now their minds were in\ndifficulty; they wanted to go somewhere else, but their love for me had become an attachment. I had to destroy that attachment -- only then could they go.\nAnd I have been destroying many attachments for their sake, because I don't want anybody to be a slave. Out of freedom they have come to me, out of freedom they should go. And if they want to remain here, out of freedom they should remain here. This is not a concentration camp. It is a meditation camp.\nQ: THIS HAS BEEN NOT SO MUCH AN INTERVIEW AS A CONVERSATION.\nA: No, I loved it.\nQ: I HAVE WRITTEN IT HERE, ANYWAY. I WILL FIND OUT LATER HOW MUCH IS ON THE TELEVISION FILM, BUT.…\nA: Do whatsoever you feel like doing. Just remember one thing: I love you, and whenever you feel alone sad, tired, come here. Again and again, come here. Good.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #5 Chapter title: Be Ready 22 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 15.]\nHoward Sattler 6PR RADIO, AUSTRALIA\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE THE CHAMPAGNE, I HAVE THE WATER. YOU SAY YOU'RE AN ORDINARY MAN. WHERE DOES THAT PLACE THE REST OF US?\nAnswer: You will be drinking water and I will not be touching the champagne. There is the difference.\nQ: YOU AND PARTICULARLY YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE CREATED QUITE AN IMPACT ON WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WHERE I COME FROM, THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS -- THEIR COMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS, AND THEIR EFFORTS TO START A COMMUNITY SCHOOL IN OUR SOUTHWEST. THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU, ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE. COULD YOU TELL THEM WHAT SORT OF PERSON YOU ARE?\nA: I don't know at all. I just live moment to moment, so you cannot confine me into a personality. You cannot define me, you cannot predict me. I don't know even myself what I am going to do tomorrow morning. I am simply as open as the existence, and as indefinable as the existence itself. So people have to figure out whatsoever they want. I am available. There are people who love me, there are people who would like to kill me. They have chosen different parts of me. They have focused their eyes according to their prejudices. But I am not concerned in any way about the opinion of others. I don't have any opinion about other people, any judgment about other people.\nQ: ARE YOU A THREAT TO THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEIR FUTURES? MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE.\nA: Perhaps. If you don't understand what I am saying, I am a threat, certainly. But if they understand what I am saying, they will rejoice, there is no threat. In\nfact, I want to make these people contemporaries. They are not. Somebody is hanging two thousand years back with Jesus Christ, somebody is hanging even farther back with Moses or Buddha. These people certainly will feel me a threat because I belong to the present.\nI want them to come to the present, otherwise there is no hope for humanity. These people are simply walking corpses, burdened with the whole load of the past -- ugly, superstitious. Certainly I am a threat to their superstitions. I am a threat to their rotten theologies. I am a threat to their concepts about morality, God, religion, about everything they have that is out of date. Certainly they will feel threatened because that's how they have become identified in their own eyes, and it is always difficult to change.\nWhenever a man like me is there, there are not two ways: either you have to be with me or you have to be against me.\nQ: DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO BECOME RAJNEESHEES?\nA: No, there is no need. They have to become contemporaries, that's enough. Rajneeshees are not an alternative. It is simply the groundwork for the contemporary man to begin with. Once the world has understood that we have to live in the present, not in the past, Rajneeshees will simply dissolve. It is not something that I would like to remain forever and forever, it is a simple device to challenge people, to bring them to their senses. And once our work is done they don't need to become Rajneeshees, they need to become contemporaries. And the moment they are contemporaries, our work is done. Rajneeshees will simply melt and dissolve into the whole world.\nQ: YOU CERTAINLY CHALLENGE PEOPLE'S TRADITIONAL VALUES, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I BELIEVE MAKES YOUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT. DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERATE AND LOOK FOR THE END RESULT RATHER THAN THE IMMEDIATE REACTION?\nA: I don't care about the end result. My whole concern is not diplomatic, not political. I am simply responding with my totality to anything that comes in front of me. I cannot be cunning. What you are saying to me -- be a little more cunning\n-- I cannot be.\nQ: YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, ARE YOU?\nA: I am not a politician. That is the ugliest thing that can happen to a man. I am not diplomatic. I do not want people to be manipulated politely. I am not a hypocrite, I simply say the truth as it is. If it hurts, it is your problem. If it creates enemies I am not worried, because the enemies are the first step to becoming my\nfriends. They have already recognized me in their hate. They have already recognized their defeat and death. Now nobody can save them. They cannot ignore me. If they can ignore me, then there is no threat for them. That's why I have to be intense, fiery, and I have to hammer hard on each traditional value, because the only thing that I would not like is to be ignored.\nQ: YOU CERTAINLY WON'T BE IGNORED, I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.\nA: Thank you for the compliment.\nQ: YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I COME FROM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHERE YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE GOT TO GET APPROVAL FROM GOVERNMENTS, FROM POLITICIANS, TO GO AHEAD WITH THEIR PROJECTS THERE. WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE TO THEM IF THE POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST YOU?\nA: Fight.\nQ: WITH GUNS?\nA: No. Legal methods are available. Those politicians themselves are claiming that they are democratic. Use their own democracy and fight with them. They are saying that their judicial system is fair? Use it and fight them. Guns are just barbarous.\nQ: YOU WOULD NEVER USE GUNS OR CONDONE THAT SORT OF...?\nA: I myself will never even touch a gun. My advice to the people who belong to me is to be intelligent, use your intelligence. And against those idiotic politicians it is a simple matter: we are going to use their own devices for their own destruction. We need not use any guns.\nQ: YOUR PERSONAL SECRETARY, SHEELA, CREATED AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. CERTAINLY SHE WAS PROBABLY NUMBER ONE ENTERTAINMENT FOR AROUND ABOUT A MONTH ON RADIO AND TELEVISION OVER THERE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY SHE HANDLED THINGS. YOU THOUGHT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT TOUGHER.\nA: She could have been. Q: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.\nA: And I have been very tough with her because I don't see any limit anywhere. You can go in any direction infinitely. Sheela is not ever going to satisfy me. She is doing her best, but I would like her to do a little more... more.\nQ: WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD COME NEXT TIME.\nA: First she has to go on preparing the ground for me. One day I am going to come.\nQ: TO AUSTRALIA, TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA?\nA: Certainly. When Sheela comes, that means I am coming. Q: SHE'S GETTING US READY, IS SHE?\nA: Yes. She is coming again. She will come again and again, and prepare the ground. And she will hit people more and more, and their values more and more, so they become ready. Because when I come, then comes the final hit.\nQ: ALL YOUR OPPONENTS WILL BE ALMOST KNOCKED OUT BY THEN.\nA: Just tell your people, \"Be ready.\"\nQ: WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THERE?\nA: I cannot say that now because I don't know myself When I come there and I see the situation and I feel the atmosphere, then whatsoever happens in me as a response.… I never prepare myself for anything. I am not an actor. No rehearsal. I simply start the drama without knowing what is going to happen.\nWe will see it. And up to now everything has gone well.\nQ: IT SURE HAS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU LIVE IN OREGON IS BECAUSE THE WEATHER SUITS YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDICAL CONDITION. THE WEATHER IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA IS ALMOST THE SAME AS OREGON.\nA: That's great! It may become my permanent residence.\nQ: THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR OPPONENTS.\nA: Certainly not. But wherever I am the situation is the same. I will find my friends, I will find my enemies. Both belong to me. In fact, they are two polarities, complementaries. There is nothing wrong in it.\nQ: YOU SAID JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT YOU ARE NOT AN ACTOR. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT CLASS YOU AS ONE OF THE GREAT COMEDIANS OF THIS WORLD.\nA: I am.\nQ: WHERE DOES THE TALENT COME FROM?\nA: Just because I don't expect any respectability from anybody. So I can act the way I want. I can be funny without any trouble. I have nothing to lose, because in the first place I have never expected the world to praise me and give me Nobel prizes and this and that. I have everything that I need, and it is within me. And I am completely fulfilled. Now I can be crazy, mad, a comedian. I am absolutely free to be anything. I can afford anything, even to be a madman. But it is within my control. And I enjoy the whole show so much.…\nQ: YOU ENJOY THE LAUGHS?\nA Yes\nQ: MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?\nA: Yes\nQ: YOU'VE SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN BE A MADMAN. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A MADMAN AT ALL. BUT THERE ARE MADMEN AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I'D ASK YOU, IF I COULD, IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON SOME OF THEM. THE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI?\nA: I said to you I can be a madman, and that is possible only if I am not mad. I can enjoy being mad, but I am not mad. That's why I can enjoy it. The madman has become identified with his madness. One thing is absolutely certain about every madman: he will never accept that he is mad. The religious leaders are mostly mad people, fanatics, and just because they are mad, fanatic, they gather all kinds of idiots around them.\nQ: WHOLE NATIONS SOMETIMES, LIKE IRAN.\nA: Yes... because most human beings are retarded. Scientifically, the average mental age of a human being is below thirteen. Now if thirteen is your mental age, you may be seventy years old, but you can be exploited, you can be\nconditioned for any nonsense. You can be made afraid of hell, for which no evidence exists. You can be motivated. Your greed can be aroused for heaven, for which no evidence exists. You can be conditioned to pray to a God who is the greatest lie in the world.\nAnd the wonder of wonders is that even in your supreme courts, where you have your best judges, the cream, the oath has to be taken in the name of God. The oath to be truthful, in the name of the greatest lie! None of those judges have seen God, none of those judges have any idea what God is. But it is being used. Most of humanity is so mediocre that it can follow any madman. The madman just has to be a little methodological, and the religious madmen are very methodological. There is no contradiction in being methodological.\nMethodology does not need intelligence. Now, what is the methodology of Jesus? -- \"I am the only begotten son of God.\" And the mediocre people are going to believe it, because not to believe in it is to go to hell and suffer for eternity. Nobody wants to suffer for eternity. As it is, one is suffering enough already. One wants some relief. Even if the relief comes after death, one wants to live peacefully and joyously, not starving, not sick, not old, not ugly. Naturally, simple methodology -- \"I am the only begotten son of God, I can save you, I have come to save the whole world, those who believe in me I will choose for paradise, and those who don't believe in me will fall into an abysmal darkness of hell\" -- a very simple methodology. And the suffering, the poor, the starving, the uneducated, the downtrodden, the oppressed, exploited are ready to cling to any hope.\nQ: WHY?\nA: Because there is nothing in their life. It is so empty that if there is no hope for them they will commit suicide. Then there is no other way. For what should they go on, continue dragging their empty lives? Just to suffer? Just to get hit, just to be crushed under the boots of people who are in power? The hope helps.\nAnd that is the methodology of all the religions: give people hope. But the strategy is very cunning: keep the hope beyond death -- because they know perfectly well that hope in this life cannot be fulfilled, and then these same people who are their followers will kill them. So keep the hope beyond death. You can never be caught. Nobody comes back from death to say that these people are lying. So they go on lying, and the more a lie is repeated, day by day, year by year, century by century, for thousands of years... it almost starts sounding as if it is true.\nQ: SO IS THE POPE A FRAUD?\nA: Certainly. Absolutely. All religions up to now have been fraud. They have deceived people and because of their deception humanity has continued to\nsuffer. Otherwise, we have enough intelligence. If we can reach to the moon, do you think we cannot manage enough food for humanity?\nQ: PERHAPS WE ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY REACHING THE MOON.\nA: That, too, is foolish. If you cannot feed people here, what are you going to do on the moon? Seventy-five percent of every nation's income, even poor nations, is going into construction for the coming war. Everybody is getting ready.\nQ: IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?\nA: If all these people are getting ready and getting excited about it, any fool can start it. My effort is that it should not happen, but the only way to prevent it is to make human beings more alert, so that they cannot be exploited by priests and politicians. And that's what I am doing. Naturally, politicians are against me -- all kinds of politicians. It is a miracle: the capitalist is against me, the socialist is against me, the communist is against me, the fascist is against me. It is simply a miracle.\nQ: BUT YOU'RE A CAPITALIST HERE, RUNNING A COMMUNE.\nA: I am not a capitalist. I use capital as a servant. It is not my political ideology. I want people to live richly in every possible way. Luxury should be available to everybody. I don't want people to become equally poor and call it communism. I want people to become equally rich, and then whatever name you want to call it, you can call it. Names don't matter.\nQ: IS THAT SORT OF WEALTH AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF, LET'S SAY, INDIA, THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT MOTHER TERESA TRIES TO HELP?\nA: These people like Mother Teresa, who have been helping the poor for centuries, are really the causes for continuing poverty. The poor cannot be helped the way Mother Teresa is helping. This is not help. This is politics, because all those orphans she helps are transformed, converted into Catholic Christianity. In fact, Mother Teresa would be out of a job if there were no orphans in. India. She needs more orphans. That's why they are all against birth control methods, against abortion. Otherwise, where are you going to get orphans? They need the poor, because without the poor whom are you going to serve? And without service you cannot reach heaven. This is a simple strategy to reach heaven.\nI love one story: It happened in China that a man fell into a well. It was the annual fair and there was so much noise that nobody took any note that he was\nshouting, \"Save me!\" A Buddhist monk passed by. He looked into the well and told the man that there was no need to cry and scream. \"Accept whatsoever is the case, be contented. In the next life you will be fulfilled a thousandfold.\" The man said, \"I am not here to listen to philosophy. I am dying and you are talking philosophy. First, please help me to get out.\"\nThe Buddhist said, \"That is against my religion, to interfere into the actions and the consequences of somebody else. You must have committed some sin in your past life. You have fallen into the well. Be happy that your sin is finished, your punishment is over. But I am not going to take you out, because tomorrow if you murder somebody then I will also be responsible for it. I am not going to be responsible for any murder.\" And he went away.\nThe man could not believe it: \"These Buddhists talk about compassion. I am dying and he talks philosophy. I am not in a state even to understand what he is saying.\"\nAnd just after him came a Confucian monk. In the old days in China the wells had no walls surrounding them, so it was very easy to fall into them in the darkness, there was no preventive measure. The Confucian monk said, \"Listen, you are the proof of what my master has said. My master has said that every well should have walls around it. Don't be worried. I am going to create a great revolution in the whole country, so that every well is well protected.\" The man said, \"But when will the revolution happen? And when will all the wells have walls? By that time I will be gone.\"\nThe Confucian said, \"You are not the question. Individuals come and go. It is a question for the whole society. We cannot bother about a single individual, we think in terms of the whole civilization.\" And he went away to create revolution. And then came a Christian monk with a bag hanging on his shoulder. He took out a rope from the bag, threw it in, took the man out. The man was immensely grateful, fell at his feet and said, \"You are the only religious man. But tell me how you guessed that somebody has fallen into the well. And you came with the rope... why are you carrying the rope?\" He said, \"We carry everything in this bag for emergency purposes, anywhere. Somebody will need to be served, and our lord Jesus Christ has said that those who serve will receive immense rewards in heaven.\"\nNow, think of a world where nobody is in need of anybody's service; everybody is happy, healthy, comfortable, luxurious. What will happen to the great Christian servants and saints? They will simply be out of a job. They need poverty to remain. That is their very source of becoming saints, holier than thou. I don't say to my people, \"Go and serve the poor.\" Service, to me, is not a beautiful word.\nI say to my people, \"If you have something, share it. But remember one thing: there is no reward beyond it. Sharing, enjoy -- that is the reward. If you pull out somebody who is drowning in a well, that's a great joy. What more reward do you want? You saved a life; you should be immensely happy. The reward is in\nthe act itself and the punishment also in the act itself They are not extrinsic, they are intrinsic.\"\nBut all these religions have been telling people the reward is somewhere far away -- beyond death, and punishment, too. Neither can it be proved, nor can it be disproved; hence their business goes on and on, and mediocre people go on following it. If all these religions disappear two things are possible: either the poor will die out of poverty... Ethiopia will disappear. So what? -- it is better that Ethiopia disappears from the earth, rather than thousands of people dying in hunger. And in hunger you don't die in a day; a man can live hungry for three months. He will become just a skeleton, and what is the point of these three months of torture?\nSo, there are two alternatives if all these great servants of people don't interfere. Either countries like Ethiopia, India, other poor countries will disappear. Let\nthem disappear. This earth cannot manage so many people.\nQ: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS WHO HAVE DONATED TO BUY FOOD FOR ETHIOPIANS WHO ARE DYING OF HUNGER, DYING OF WAR?\nA: It does not help. It simply will save a few Ethiopians, who will produce more Ethiopians.\nQ: WE SHOULD STOP AID TO ETHIOPIA?\nA: You should completely stop, because the world needs only one-fourth of the population that it has right now. Only then can people be peaceful, living comfortably, joyously. There is no need. What is the point? I have been in India for fifty years, and for thirty years I have been teaching people that birth control is absolutely essential, that abortion is absolutely essential. And they were throwing stones at me, knives at me, shoes at me; that was my reward.\nQ: IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AND PERHAPS SOUTH AMERICA, OPPRESSED COUNTRIES, SHOULD THERE BE A MORATORIUM ON ALL BIRTHS FOR, SAY, TWENTY YEARS?\nA: That's what I said, that there should be total birth control for twenty or thirty years.\nThat's what I was saying, that there are two possibilities. One, the poor will disappear. Please don't serve them, be compassionate. Your service is not compassion, your service is your greed for heaven. You are using human people and their poverty for your own joys in heaven -- beautiful women who are always young, who don't even perspire and don't need any deodorant.\nIn the Mohammedan heaven there are rivers of wine. You cannot get water in the Mohammedan heaven, only wine. Here it is a crime, here it is a sin. And the same thing that is sin here -- Mohammedans are against alcohol; by a miracle, the same wine becomes virtue. Saints are enjoying it. To look at somebody else's wife with lustful eyes is sin. And your saints, what are they doing in heaven? They are not married, there is no marriage in heaven. They are enjoying all kinds of women.\nBe compassionate. Either let the poor die, or if you are REALLY compassionate, then stop this wastage of your energy and money for war efforts and drop these boundaries between nations. Let there be only one government -- which is enough! There is no need for America and Soviet Union and India and Ethiopia. Just let there be one global government.\nQ: WHO WOULD BE ITS PRESIDENT, RONALD REAGAN?\nA: Certainly not!\nQ: YOU?\nA: No! Not I, because I don't want to get into any stupid mess. Not Reagan, because if the world is one, people will find a better, wiser man. Because the world will be available to choose, and they will not choose Reagan, with a chimpanzee as his friend. There are wiser people in the world.\nAnd the moment nations are not there, war is impossible. Seventy-five percent of the income of the whole world can change the whole scene. There will be nobody who is poor. There is no need for anybody to be poor. And if there is one world, all scientific effort will become creative. Right now it is destructive, right now it prepares only for war; but when there is no need for any war all scientific minds will take a 180-degree turn. It will be creative. We can create so much that nobody will bother about paradise.\nQ: WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN? YOU'RE ENOUGH OF A REALIST TO KNOW THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN TOMORROW.\nA: I don't know. I am simply saying that these are the two alternatives. Either let the poor die and don't make a fuss about it, or, if you are really concerned, then let the nations disappear so there is no need for war. And scientific efforts automatically will go towards making more comfort, more luxury, more health, longer life. I am not concerned what happens, I am simply saying these are the only two alternatives. There is no third alternative. And I am telling my people to spread the word all over the world. Four years we have been here, and not a single baby has been born. Just simple intelligence is needed.\nQ: BUT WHY NO BABIES HERE? PEOPLE HERE, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, COULD AFFORD TO PROCREATE.\nA: No. If they want to live really joyously and luxuriously, there is no need. If they want freedom and equality between man and woman, then it is better to avoid babies.\nQ: BUT SURELY THE HUMAN RACE WILL DIE OUT OF EXISTENCE IF EVERYBODY DOES THAT?\nA: No, no. I am not saying that. My proposal is that people stop this accidental creation of babies and start looking for a more scientific way. Any man, any woman who wants a baby, should be given permission by the medical board. It does not matter if the medical board says to the husband, \"You are not the right person for this woman. You will have to take some semen, either from the hospital bank or from somebody whom we propose, to make this woman pregnant. Then your child will be a genius.\"\nQ: SO YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE TEST-TUBE BABY PROGRAM?\nA: I am absolutely in favor of scientific production of children. Q: A MASTER RACE.\nA: Right now it is mass production -- and accidental. That will not be mass production and it will not be accidental. It will be intelligent, and we will not be producing in a factory. There is no need for so many people to be produced, we need only a few people. And as science goes on serving humanity and human needs, people will be living longer and longer, and we will need fewer and fewer new people. It is an absolute certainty that we have the capacity to live at least three hundred years.\nThere is no question of mass production. And even if you want to call this mass production, so what? If it is better than your individual, haphazard way of production, not knowing what you are doing, not knowing what is happening.… You are just making love to a woman, absolutely unconscious of what is going on in the biology, of what kind of child is going to be born: blind, deaf, retarded, mad, sick from the very birth, crippled.… You call it an intelligent way? The intelligent way will be that we can manage that the best human seeds meet together from the very beginning. And we can program -- now it has become possible -- we can program the egg and the semen cell for anything. It is a question of giving a certain program.\nQ: BHAGWAN, I AM FIFTEEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM HOME, AND EVEN NOW I THINK I CAN HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DESTROY THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\nA: Let them scream. It will give them good exercise. I call it Dynamic Meditation. I am always for scientific, intelligent efforts because all religions and political efforts have failed. Now there is only one thing left, and that is science. Let us try it once. If that too fails, that means life is impossible on this earth. Perhaps it has come to its death point.\nQ: IF YOUR PREDICTIONS ARE CORRECT IT WILL BE AIDS THAT WILL REDUCE AND CONTAIN THE WORLD'S POPULATION, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID THAT IT WILL KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE HERE HAVE GONE TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO STOP IT INFILTRATING YOUR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE CONDOMS AND RUBBER GLOVES SUPPLIED TO ALL. MEDICAL SCIENTISTS, HOWEVER, ARE CLOSELY MONITORING AIDS, AND THEY SAY THAT ONLY A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO KILL SO MANY PEOPLE?\nA: It is absolutely clear, simple arithmetic. It is scientifically certain now that there is no remedy for AIDS. The man who has it is going to die within two years' time. Two years is the maximum limit. He may die within six months or two months or six weeks or today, but he cannot live more than two years. And medicine has nothing to help. There is no way, because AIDS is not an ordinary disease. It is a very strange disease. It simply destroys your resistance against diseases. You become vulnerable to all infections, all contagions. Nothing inside you is there to fight against it, it is as if the very life force has disappeared.\nAnd this man who has AIDS can have many contacts. Before he became aware, he may have had many contacts, sexual relationships. He must have given AIDS to those people, and they will be spreading it. And now it is known that it can be given to a person even by kissing -- not even sexual intercourse is needed -- because saliva carries the disease. Kissing should be absolutely illegal.\nQ: WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?\nA: Rub your noses. There are tribes who don't kiss, they just rub their noses and enjoy. I don't see that there is any problem. And noses are hygienic. Find some other alternative. But kissing cannot be in favor of human life anymore. It can pass, they suspect, even through breathing. That's why I say it can spread like wildfire.\nI would not like my people to die from AIDS. Dying is not a problem. I am not afraid of death, but death should be a celebration, it should come out in a joyful,\nblissful mood. We celebrate death here. We dance, we sing. This is the final goodbye to the person whom we have loved and with whom we have known many beautiful moments. What more can we do? But dying from AIDS will not be a celebration.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HOMOSEXUALS? -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR SPREADING MOST OF THE AIDS.\nA: They are all perverse. But the religions are responsible for homosexuality, it is a religious perversion. The first homosexuals happened in monasteries where men were not allowed to see women, in nunneries where women were not allowed to see men. There are monasteries where for one thousand years not even a six-month-old female baby has entered. It is not allowed. Sometimes I wonder! A six-month-old female baby is not allowed to go inside... are there monks living there, or monsters? But they have become monsters. They are not meditating, they are masturbating.\nQ: THEY TELL US THEY'RE CELIBATE.\nA: They go on telling that to the whole world. But they should come to the scientific lab and prove it. How can they be celibate? Nobody can be celibate. It is just as if somebody says that he does not urinate. You will not believe him. He will say it is his religion not to urinate. Nobody will believe him, but everybody believes celibacy.\nThere is no celibacy. It has never existed, and all those who have pretended either became homosexuals or became masturbators. Or, if they were not courageous enough even to be homosexuals or to masturbate, then nature has its own way: in their sleep their semen will be released. They will be having beautiful women in their dreams. Mahatma Gandhi, who tried his whole life after he had given birth to five sons -- he must have been forty at that time -- for thirty years he tried to be celibate. Impossible. He was having wet dreams even at the age of seventy.\nQ: HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LUCKY. NOT MANY SEVENTY-YEAR-OLDS HAVE THAT SORT OF DREAMS, DO THEY?\nA: No. If you are repressed, only then can you have them. If you are enjoying love, you will be spent.\nQ: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CELIBATE?\nA: Right now I am celibate, but if my health gets better I am not going to be celibate. I have never been celibate. I do not do anything against nature. Right\nnow I am celibate not because celibacy has any value, but just because I am sick. I don't have any energy to make love to a woman and do all the gymnastics, no. I have enough energy to talk to my people, to talk to you. If I get healthy again, I promise you, I will not be celibate.\nQ: DON'T PROMISE ME, PROMISE THEM. ALL THESE LADIES ABOUT THE PLACE TELL ME THAT YOU'RE A GREAT LOVER.\nA: I am!\nQ: HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT?\nA: Many of them must have loved me. I must have loved them. Q: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH THEM?\nA: Certainly. How do you love if you don't have sex with them? Q: HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR SEXUAL PARTNERS?\nA: No question, because I don't have any contract, any relationship, anything similar to marriage. No, just for the moment, in the moment.\nTraveling in a train I meet a stranger... I don't ask even the name of the woman, because we may never meet again. What is the point? But if she is willing. And\nI am really the Blessed One: I don't know why, but women are always willing. I have never come across a woman who was not willing. If I was not willing, that is another matter -- but if I was willing, then I have never come across a woman in my life who was not willing.\nAnd there was no question of any promise that, \"I will love you forever, forever.\" There is no problem. It is just a momentous, momentary affair. We share this moment, we enjoy this moment. And perhaps at the next station I will be gone, or she will be gone and we may never see each other again. I have not seen again many women with whom I had a beautiful moment of love.\nBut there are many women here in my commune, and that proves a very fundamental thing: that although I have loved so many women they are not jealous of each other.\nQ: HAVE YOU EVER COME CLOSE TO GETTING MARRIED?\nA: No, never. I have been against marriage from the very beginning, because that means cutting down your freedom. Getting attached legally to a woman or to a man, no. Freedom to me is the ultimate value There is nothing higher than freedom.\nIt was difficult, because I was fighting from the very beginning. My parents were in difficulty, my family was in difficulty, but I told them absolutely clearly that I was not going to be married. They would have been perfectly happy if I had been going to be a celibate monk. I said, \"No, I am not going to be a celibate monk either.\"\nThat was their trouble: if I was going to be a celibate monk they would be happy. In fact, they would have felt proud that their son had become a great monk. I said, \"No, both are ditches. I am going to walk just in the middle, on the razor's edge.\" And I have enjoyed the walk tremendously.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURES FROM THE SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVED? -- NOT JUST YOUR PARENTS -- BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE DAYS INDIAN SOCIETY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CLOSE AND WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT YOU DID ONE OF TWO THINGS.\nA: I am intelligent enough for that society.\nQ: SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY NOW TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE MARRIED? SHOULD THEY ALL GET DIVORCED?\nA: Everybody should get divorced, without exception. People should meet and love each other occasionally, as opportunity comes. There should be no ugly state when a wife has to make love to a man whom she does not love anymore, but she has to fulfill her duty. The husband is fulfilling his duty. While he is making love to the woman he may be thinking of some other woman, she may be thinking of some other man. What kind of neurotic society have you created? If you don't love each other, at least be human and say frankly that it was beautiful to be together, but now it is finished. Say goodbye.\nI would like marriage to disappear completely from the world, and with marriage, divorce will disappear. With marriage, prostitution will disappear. With marriage, most of the work of the priest will disappear. With marriage, almost ninety-nine percent of the psychoanalysts, therapists, psychiatrists will disappear. It is marriage that is creating all kinds of psychological perversions, repressions, guilt.\nIt is simply human that you see a beautiful woman and you would like to have some time with her. It does not need any God's permission. Even your God committed rape with the Virgin Mary without her consent.\nQ: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY?\nA: I just believe that story because it proves that your God is a rapist; otherwise, I don't believe in the story. Jesus must be a bastard. It is certain he was not the son\nof Joseph, and just to cover up the whole thing, that great story has been invented.\nQ: GOT GOD TO DO THE JOB!\nA: They say God is a trinity: God, the Holy Ghost and the son. The Holy Ghost did it, but he is part of God. It is just like my hand is part of me and your genitals are part of you, the Holy Ghost is part af God. Perhaps he is his genitals. Otherwise, how could he manage to make a virgin girl pregnant?\nQ: WHAT ABOUT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, THE MARRIED PARTNERS' RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR CHILDREN, FOR A START?\nA: Children should be the responsibility of the commune, not of the family. It is the family which creates tremendous problems in the children's minds. It gives them all their sickness, all their superstitions, all their stupid ideas, theologies, religion, political parties. It enforces on the child. The child has to be freed from the family. If you want a new man... then the family is an ugly institution, its time is over. It should be replaced by the commune. And then it is very easy: the commune takes care of all the children.\nThere will be the father, the mother. They can meet the child, the child can come to them. But basically it is the responsibility of the commune to take care of the children. The children will have many uncles and many aunts, and they will have more opportunity for human contact with different types of people. They will be immensely enriched.\nOur children are very impoverished. They know only one man, one woman, and they know the constant quarrel between the two. The woman is nagging the husband, the husband is beating the woman. And this is what you are training them for. Your boy will repeat you. He will be your carbon copy, knowingly or unknowingly. Your daughter will repeat your wife, knowingly... unknowingly. That's why no son can ever forgive his father, and no daughter can ever forgive her mother. They destroyed their lives. It is absolutely a psychologically proved phenomenon.\nBut if the commune takes care, then they will have experiences of so many different kinds of people. It is my experience that every person is so unique that the more contacts, intimacies, love affairs you have, the richer you will be. I have not seen two women who are similar. Making love to many women, I have seen every woman is a unique personality in herself, her way of making love is totally different. The people who have never known anyone except their wives are really poor. They don't know how many nuances, how many fragrances, how many different ecstasies are possible through love.\nThe same is true about children. They should be available to the whole commune. And because the commune is responsible, you need not be afraid\nwhat will happen to the children if you separate. You can separate. Nothing will happen to the children, the children will be the same.\nQ: HOW DO YOU RELATE THAT TO A WESTERN SOCIETY WHERE MOST PEOPLE LIVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY IN EACH HOME, NOT IN A COMMUNE? WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN THERE?\nA: It can be immediately transformed into a commune. There is no problem. Just understanding is needed. A whole big building which has ten thousand people living in it can become a commune. It is a question of understanding, there is no problem in it. Now there are skyscraper buildings -- each building can be a commune.\nQ: AND A STREET ROW OF HOUSES?\nA: Yes, they can also become communes. We are making communes all over the world; purchasing properties, different houses, making one commune. Sometimes we have difficulty getting all the houses in one place. No difficulty then, either. We have one main house, the meeting house, and the commune people live in different places.\nBut they have dropped the idea of the family. It is not a question of arrangements. Arrangements can be made very easily The question is of understanding. Our mind is created by the family, so it is very difficult to think that there should be no family. But the family is the basic unit of the nation. Unless the family disappears, the nation cannot disappear. The family is the basic unit of the church, so I am cutting at the very root.\nQ: YOU SURE ARE.\nA: If the family disappears, then nations cannot exist anymore. Churches and their congregations will simply disappear from the world.\nWe need individuals. I respect the individual the most. The individual should be able to have as many experiences about everything as he is capable of, so that all his potential becomes actual.\nRight now the situation is really sad. Even our geniuses like Albert Einstein use only fifteen percent of their potential. What a poor world we are creating. If an Albert Einstein uses only fifteen percent of his potential, then what about the ordinary people? -- perhaps three percent, four percent, at the most five percent... and you will call these people talented. Beyond five percent you will call them geniuses. I am not ready for this retarded world.\nQ: YOU TALKED BEFORE ABOUT WOMEN AS SEXUAL PARTNERS AND AS LOVERS, BUT YOU SEE THEM AS A LOT MORE THAN THAT. IN FACT,\nLOOKING AROUND HERE, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IT'S THE WOMEN WHO ARE RUNNING THE PLACE.\nA: Yes, that is true.\nQ: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MEN?\nA: Man has been running the whole society for thousands of years, and he has proved absolutely impotent to run the society in the right direction. Give the chance to the woman now.\nMy commune is running far better than any society which is dominated by male chauvinists. It is running perfectly beautifully. There is no problem. All my communes around the world are run by women. Man has proved his incapacity. He has tried hard enough to repress women, to keep them uneducated, to keep them economically dependent, to keep them almost like cattle, so that he can prove he is very superior. But the basic phenomenon is that man feels inferior to a woman because he cannot give birth to a child. The woman can give birth to a child; man's function in giving birth is only that of an injection.\nThe woman has the capacity to give birth to children. That creates a deep sense of inferiority complex in man. To cover it up he started repressing woman, cutting her talents, telling her that she is not capable of anything, that she is only capable of doing the jobs of cooking, taking care of the children, washing the floor; of more than that she is not capable. Only man is capable of all the great things.\nAll religions are founded by man, and all religions have condemned women. Jainism, one of the most ancient religions in India, says that from the body of a woman nobody can be liberated, nobody can become enlightened. From the female body, nobody can grow into consciousness. Strange. The same people go on teaching that body and soul are separate, and the soul is neither male nor female, and that growth happens in the soul, and that liberation is of the soul, not of the body. Then why can't women enter into paradise?\nNo, they have to be put down in every possible way. First, they should practice religious disciplines so that they are born in a man's body in their next life. All that they can do right now is pray, meditate, fast, to get into a man's body in the next life. Then there is a possibility. From the female body there is no possibility. In India they were not allowed to read religious scriptures.\nJesus had twelve apostles, twelve idiots around him, who could not do anything to save the man. They all knew that the next day he was going to be crucified, they all knew that he was going to be caught that night, and not a single one of them was courageous enough to tell Jesus that going to Jerusalem was suicidal. There was no need. Why should they go there? It was not the right time. He would be crucified.\nNot a single woman was Jesus' apostle. But when he was crucified all the men had escaped. Only three women were there under the cross: his mother, Mary; his lover perhaps, Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute; and another woman called Martha. All the apostles had disappeared.\nMen have been telling women that they weak, which is medically wrong. Women live longer than men, five years longer. Women suffer less from diseases than men. Women go mad half as often as men. Women commit suicide half as often as men. Still, the woman is weak, and she has to be kept cut off from every corner so she cannot grow. And half the society consists of women. They give birth to your children.\nWhat you are doing to the woman you are also doing to your children, because they will be taking care of the children; the children will be learning from and imitating the woman. That's why every language is called mother tongue. Even Germans don't have the guts to call their language father tongue.\nQ: SO WHEN YOU GO, WHEN YOU DIE, WILL A WOMAN BECOME THE LEADER OF THE RAJNEESHEES?\nA: I don't care. I don't care at all. I am a man who is not concerned with past or future.\nQ: BUT YOU CARE FOR THE FUTURE OF RAJNEESHEES?\nA: I care in this moment. It is not caring about their future. In this moment I care. What happens tommorrow I have nothing to do with. But in this moment, whatsoever response arises in me I have to share with my people.\nQ: HAVE YOU MET A WOMAN WHO COULD DO THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING AS WELL?\nA: It is very difficult to say. Because unless the opportunity is given, one never knows what a woman can do, what a man can do. It is always the opportunity. While I am here it is difficult for any woman to do what I am doing. Once I am gone, perhaps a woman can do it better than a man. Perhaps she may do even better than me. After all, unfortunately, I belong to the male race.\nQ: WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN A WOMAN?\nA: No, because I love women so much. I would not be able to love men, that would be the difficulty.\nQ: WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL? WHY ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS THE LEADER? YOU TELL PEOPLE THINGS, AND THEY FOLLOW WHAT YOU\nSAY, BUT WHY YOU? WHY NOT SOMEBODY ELSE? WHY NOT NOBODY? COULD THESE PEOPLE NOT JUST FOLLOW YOUR PHILOSOPHIES WITHOUT YOU TELLING THEM?\nA: You ask them -- because I am not their leader. I have not told them that they are my followers. I have not asked them to come and be here with me. It is their business and their problem, and their responsibility. I am a very irresponsible person. I don't take anybody else's responsibility. It is enough that I take my own responsibility.\nYou will have to ask my people why.\nQ: DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT THEY FOLLOW YOU THE WAY THEY DO?\nA: It surprises me immensely. It is really a miracle. I am nobody's leader, but there are half a million people who think they are my followers.\nQ: DO YOU ENJOY THE ADORATION?\nA: No. Not at all. I hate it. I enjoy friendship. Adoration is putting somebody high above you. I don't have any ego. I am not higher than anybody else, not holier than anybody else.\nBut it certainly surprises me. They adore... they must be crazy! Now what can I do about it? You tell me.\nQ: I'D JUST GO ALONG WITH IT.\nA: That's okay.\nQ: I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR ROLLS ROYCES AND I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR HALF-MILLION-DOLLAR WATCH, BUT I KNOW THAT ANY FASHION-CONSCIOUS PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, WHO'VE SEEN YOU WOULD SAY, \"WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE MAGNIFICENT CLOTHES FROM?\"\nA: My women make them. They love to see me in fabulous clothes. Q: ARE YOU FASHION CONSCIOUS?\nA: I love everything that is beautiful. I will not say I am fashion conscious, because my robe is not a fashion.\nQ: WELL I'VE GOT A FEELING YOU MIGHT BE GOING TO START A NEW FASHION.\nA: That is possible. I love everything that is beautiful, but I am not fashion conscious, otherwise I would be imitating somebody else who is fashionable. My people design my clothes. They enjoy, and they know that I love only the best of everything. So they do it, and try their best. And I am perfectly contented with my people. In fact, I adore them. Nobody has been so fortunate as I am.\nJesus certainly was surrounded by fools. Buddha had not the guts to allow women to enter into his commune. For almost twenty years he continuously refused to initiate a woman. What was the fear? And when he was asked why, he said, \"If I allow women into the commune, then my religion will last only five hundred years. If I don't allow women into my commune, my religion will last for five thousand years.\"\nBut why this desire that the religion should last for five thousand years? This seems to be only greed, immense greed, to keep your firm running for five thousand years. What is the point? And why are you afraid that if you allow women entry, your religion will be gone within five hundred years? The fear is every man's fear.\nMan feels deep down that he is inferior; the woman is superior. She is beautiful. The man tries also to imitate. For what reason does he shave his mustache, his beard? Just think of a woman growing a beard and mustache -- do you think she will look very beautiful?\nQ: SHE'D BE IN THE CIRCUS.\nA: Yes. And that is the situation about the men who have cut their beards and mustaches. They are in the circus.\nQ: BHAGWAN, YOU'VE RAISED A LOT OF CONSCIOUSNESS, I KNOW. I CAN PREDICT THAT ALREADY FROM WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE. ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT IT ALL, OR IS IT ALL JUST ONE BIG JOKE?\nA: Not serious at all. It is all a big joke. Seriousness is not my business at all. I am an absolutely nonserious person, enjoying the small things of life, unconcerned about the next moment.\nI have lived my whole life this way and I don't repent. I don't feel that I have missed anything.\nQ: PERHAPS A FINAL MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA ABOUT YOU, ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE, AND PERHAPS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEE FROM YOU? DO YOU HAVE ONE? THEY'RE ALL WAITING.\nA: Nothing can be said about the future, but they will see some great circus, certainly.\nQ: SOON?\nA: Soon.\nQ: THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO APPEAR ON THE PROGRAM.\nA: I was glad to talk to you. Q: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.\nA: Come again and again whenever you can. And tell the people there that I am coming.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #6 Chapter title: It Is Up To You 23 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 16.]\nMa Yoga Pratima BHAGWAN MAGAZINE, RAJNEESHPURAM, OREGON\nQUESTION: BELOVED BHAGWAN, ON BEHALF OF ALL THE SANNYASINS I WANT TO THANK YOU THAT YOU ARE SHOWING US EVERY DIMENSION OF YOUR BEING -- SO CASUALLY, SO MATTER-OF-FACT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT TO ASK AS A DISCIPLE MYSELF AND AS A REPORTER WHO COMMUNICATES IT TO FELLOW SANNYASINS, IS: HOW, IN WHAT WAYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US BECOME AS ORDINARY AS YOU ARE?\nANSWER: One never becomes ordinary. You can become extraordinary. The very process of becoming leads you away from being ordinary. So there is no how as far as being ordinary is concerned. You are ordinary. You don't have to become. You have to drop becoming, you have to start living. These are the two types of people in the world: those who are continuously becoming and in their very effort of becoming this and that, they are losing being what they are. They are losing time, life, energy, and their becoming is never going to end.\nIt is just like the horizon there, appearing so close that you can reach it -- just a few more miles to go. But as you reach the few miles, you find the horizon has receded again, the distance remains always the same. The person who is caught in the net of becoming wastes his whole life, dies unfulfilled, in tremendous despair, because he can see that the whole life was there for him to live, but because of his desire to become something, someone, he sacrificed all that was freely available to him.\nOne does not become ordinary. You are ordinary. You are born ordinary, just like everything else in existence: animals, birds, trees. No bird needs to be ordinary. No tree asks, inquires how to be ordinary. But man asks it. And this very process of becoming makes you insane.\nDrop becoming anybody else. Drop the very idea that you have to be according to some discipline, some scripture, some theology. Forget completely that you have to be like Jesus or Buddha or Mahavira, and suddenly you will find you are\nwho you are. Live it joyously, without any guilt. Existence wanted you to be what you are. If existence wanted another Jesus he would have created thousands of Jesuses, there is no problem. He would have made Jesuses on an assembly line. But he makes only individuals. Existence never duplicates, never makes anybody similar to somebody else.\nThis is the beauty and the glory of existence. This is a blessing, that nobody like you has ever existed and will ever exist again. You are simply unique. Don't waste this uniqueness in running after some goal, some shadow.\nNow, because I am telling you it is so beautiful to be ordinary, it is so joyous to be ordinary, you have made being ordinary also a goal. Your question would have been perfectly right if you had asked how to become a Jesus Christ, how to become a Buddha, how to become a great celebrity.\nBut the very processes of becoming and being ordinary are absolutely diametrically opposite to each other. You are where you are trying to reach. There is nowhere to go. You have not to become anybody. This very moment you are what existence wanted you to be. Don't miss it. Enjoy it. All the religions have deceived humanity and created the idea of becoming in the mind of man. Once you get caught in the idea of becoming, then there is only misery, suffering, anxiety, anguish, despair, defeat, death.\nThat's what has been happening to millions of people for thousands of years. Everybody was trying to become something. You cannot go against nature. You cannot in any way be anything other than what you are. The very effort of becoming something, someone, is absurd. But how have the religions managed to make this whole earth a madhouse? They gave you goals, they gave you great ideals you have to fulfill. It is impossible. By the sheer nature of things, it is impossible. But because it is impossible, far away, it becomes a challenge to your ego. The impossible has a tremendous attraction, but you are forgetting that it is impossible. It may have tremendous attraction because of its impossibility, but you are going to be a failure finally.\nThere are so many people who realize that they were alive only when they die. When they were alive they were so busy with so many things, they completely forgot about life. They remembered it only when they knew that only a few breaths are left -- the heart is sinking, only a few beats more -- that is the moment the realization occurs to them, \"What a fool I have been. The whole life has simply passed by my side. I have not drunk from its wine, I have not eaten its fruits, I am not even acquainted with its fragrance. What was it? And now it is too late.\"\nThat's why I say only the ordinary being is capable of rejoicing, because his energy is not involved in any process of becoming. It is all available, it is overflowing. What can you do with overflowing energy? Sing, dance, rejoice.\nMy insistence for ordinariness has tremendous implications you may not be aware of. By telling you to be just ordinary, I am making you free from all strategies of religions, theologies, political ideologies. I am cutting their very\nroot, even without mentioning it. If you are ready to be ordinary, nobody can exploit you. Nobody can push you in a direction which is not for you. Nobody can create a guilt in you. Nobody can say that something is wrong in you. I am making you free from all kinds of parasites.\nAll over the world they have been using the same methodology just to make you feel guilty. What you eat is wrong, how you live is wrong, how you sit is wrong, how you walk is wrong. They have not left anything for you to decide for yourself. Somebody else -- Manu, five thousand years ago -- has decided for Hindus how they should be, and for five thousand years Hindus have been imprisoned by that man Manu. And it is so stupid.\nYou just be what you are... no becoming. Being is my message. Up to now becoming has been the message of everybody. Being is my message. Becoming has created guilt, sadness, despair, because you cannot do it. On each step you fall, and on each step you realize how poor, how inferior, how powerless you are. On each step you are forced to recognize that you are unintelligent, stupid; otherwise, why are you not succeeding?\nYou are not stupid, you are not unintelligent, you are not powerless. You are just trying to do something which simply cannot be done.\nHave you seen sometimes a dog trying to catch his tail? A dog is sitting, is in a thinking mood, contemplating; he sees the tail, becomes curious: \"What is this?\" Naturally, if human beings are doing such stupid things, you cannot expect a dog not to do a stupid thing. He tries to catch hold of the tail that is lying there, but as he tries, the tail moves away. He tries harder -- that is logical -- he jumps with as much force as possible, but he is simply amazed that the tail also jumps in the same proportion and the distance remains the same. But I think dogs are not so idiotic. After a few efforts he realizes that this is not possible. He drops the idea, forgets about the tail. It is his own tail, there is no problem. But man goes on and on, chasing something, a shadow.\nNo, don't make ordinariness a goal somewhere away from you, so that a path is needed, a discipline is needed; so that you have to follow a leader, you have to listen to a priest, you have to change your habits, you have to fit with the goal. Nobody in the whole history has ever succeeded in becoming anybody else. And it is good that everybody has failed, because even if one man had succeeded, he would have proved all the religions right. One exception would have been enough. If one can succeed, then why not others? History totally supports me. Without exception, everybody has failed-except those few rare people who have never tried to become anybody, who simply lived ordinarily without any plan, without any tomorrow, without any ideals, without any philosophy, who have simply lived.\nLiving is my religion. Living herenow, and living as you are without any conditions, without any qualification, that's my message.\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHY DO RAJNEESHEES, WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD, INTO THE COURTS, ALREADY FEEL AS IF THEY ARE GUILTY? WHY DOESN'T OUR CONVICTION COME OUT? WHY AREN'T WE PROUD OF OURSELVES? WHY DO WE BEHAVE LIKE SUCH WIMPS?\nA: For the simple reason that you are not yet what I am trying to get you to understand. When you go out, you try to prove you are somebody special. You try to prove that you are no ordinary human beings. You are somebody chosen, you have a message, you have a special way of life. You have certain understanding which everybody else is lacking. Naturally you will feel in difficulty because they are in the majority and you are alone.\nHere in the commune you can rejoice in being special, because everybody is rejoicing in being special, there is no problem. And nobody cares what anybody thinks, nobody is trying to impress anybody. In the commune you are living simply. There you become tense, tight, afraid of public opinion; you want to prove in the public's eyes that you are a superior being to them, which you cannot prove. Nobody is superior or inferior. There is no question of comparison. And the very tension, tightness, anxiety makes you feel guilty, as if you have betrayed me, as if you have not been the way you were expected to be.\nI have no expectations of you. Go to the courts, to the marketplace, anywhere, but remain ordinary, with no attitude of holier than thou. And you will be surprised: there is no tension, there is no anxiety, there is no guilt. And your intelligence will function more efficiently because you will be so relaxed.\nIt is a miracle to know the beauty and the power of being relaxed. Suddenly your intelligence has a sharpness that you were not aware of Your capacities come to their very peak. You function not just on the minimum survival level, but on the maximum. Your torch of life burns from both ends together.\nIt is a strange thing. You were trying to be special and you felt guilty. You were trying to prove yourself holier, higher, and you were feeling a failure. Now you are not trying to be higher, and you are. You are not trying to be better than anybody else, but you are, because they are not relaxed and you are relaxed. And that small difference makes such a great difference that it is immeasurable.\nIn my whole life I never felt guilty about anything. I don't have any idea how you feel guilty. What kind of thing is guilt? Intellectually I understand, but existentially I have never experienced it, for the simple reason that I have never tried to be anything other than I was.\nI have been in the courts and I have enjoyed it. In fact, the judges became tense, the advocates became tense, my own advocate became nervous about what I was saying, what I was doing. The whole court was full of tension. I could not understand what was the matter. I should have been tense. Why were they in such anxiety? The case was against me, I was ready to face it, because I didn't see there was any crime.…\nThere was one church, specially for British people, which had been closed for many years, because when the British rule ended in India, all the foreigners moved out. The archbishop of England -- thousands of miles away -- was the owner of that church in Jabalpur.\nI had a few Christian friends. I said to them \"This beautiful church always remains closed.\" They said, \"The congregation of that church is no more here, the nearest authority is in the capital, Nagpur. The bishop of Nagpur is the nearest authority who has the keys. But the real authority is with the archbishop of England.\"\nI said, \"You are just fools. Break the lock -- it is already falling apart since ten years. Clean the church. This is your church. Use it.\"\nThey became excited, the idea was good. The church was a beautiful building with a very big garden around it, but it had become a jungle, nobody was taking any care. They broke the lock. They asked me to inaugurate the opening. I said, \"I am perfectly ready\" and so I inaugurated their church.\nIt took a few days for the bishop of Nagpur to understand what was happening there. Then he inquired of the archbishop of England what to do, \"because a few Christians have broken the lock, entered the property, and are worshipping every Sunday there.\" Of course the archbishop was angry and he told him, \"Take legal action against them.\"\nThe legal action was taken against them. That's why I was also found guilty. I inaugurated it, I inspired those people to enter into the church, so I was the most responsible person. I said to the judge, \"A church, a temple, a mosque, a synagogue belongs to those who worship there. It is no ordinary property. For ten years the church has remained without a single worshipper. The archbishop of England is guilty for that, the bishop of Nagpur is guilty for that. Who are they to lock a church and prevent worshippers?\n\"I am not a Christian, but I can see that a beautiful place which was meant for worshipping, for prayer, is lying empty. Jesus Christ is still hanging on the cross and nobody comes. He must be getting bored.\"\nI said, \"Yes, I inspired these people to make that church again alive. It is dying. And to make any church alive is not a crime. To keep it locked... locked against whom? In fact, churches and temples should not have doors, so that they are available twenty-four hours for anybody to meditate there. It is a place of silence.\"\nMy advocate was getting to the point of nervous breakdown when I said that the archbishop of England should be given an arrest warrant... and these people were going to continue worshipping in the church. The judge said, \"Whatever you are saying is absolutely right, but it is not legal. The church is a property owned by the Church of England. Entering into somebody else's property, taking possession of it, using it, is trespass.\"\nI said, \"Then I am ready to be punished, to be jailed. But remember, you are doing something absolutely wrong. You are not making any difference between\na place of worship and an ordinary house. A place of worship cannot be owned by anybody, cannot be possessed by anybody. It belongs to those who are ready to worship there. Tell the archbishops of Nagpur and England that either they should come here and bring their congregation, so the church becomes alive, or... why are they worried? They were happy for ten years. The church was gathering dust, it was going to become a ruin.\n\"And I am not a Christian at all. I have no concern with that church, just a human concern, a compassion. These people I know, and I told them, 'If you are ready to worship, the church is yours.' And I take the whole responsibility on myself, these people are not in any way responsible. They simply got inspired by me.\" There was silence. The advocate sent by the bishop of Nagpur could not figure out what to say. The judge told me that it was legally wrong, but spiritually right: \"I cannot give any punishment to you. But please don't do anything like that again.\"\nI said, \"That I cannot agree with. I will continue my whole life doing things like that, because I don't care about man-made laws. My concern is with the existential, with the spiritual, with the real. Man-made laws go on changing.\"\nBut those Christians who had agreed and opened the church became afraid. The bishop of Nagpur put another big lock. I lived in Jabalpur for twenty years, and by the time I left Jabalpur the church was in ruins, the roof had fallen. This is according to the law.\nWhy should I be afraid or guilty? And I am ready to accept any consequences of my actions. I have been moving for thirty years in the country facing hostile masses -- sometimes fifty thousand people, all hostile. But I have never felt any guilt, because whatever I was doing, I was doing with my totality. And whatever I was doing, I was doing with full consciousness. And seeing me, listening to me, although they had come with aggressive prejudices, I could see slowly, slowly a calmness was descending on them. And by the end, when I left, many were in tears.\nIn Ahmedabad a man came just after I had finished the meeting, fell at my feet and said, \"Forgive me.\" I said, \"But you have not done anything to me, why should I forgive you?\" He said, \"I have not done what I had come to do,\" and he showed me a big knife that he was carrying. He said, \"I had come to kill you because I had been told that you are against religion, and I am a great devotee of Krishna.\" He was a fanatic Hindu.\nI said, \"Then why don't you kill me?\" He said, \"Listening to you I became aware that what you are saying is religion. You are not against religion, you are against religions. Those religions I have followed up to now, but I want to change. I had come to kill you, but you have killed me!\" And that man is a sannyasin since then and has been a very stable, reliable sannyasin.\nJust go simply anywhere as you are and present yourself openly. We don't have any secrets; only guilty people have secrets. Only people who are burdened with\nthe idea of sin have secrets. We don't have any secrets. We don't have any theology, so nobody can contradict you.\nThere is a saying that man proposes and God disposes. What I am doing here is: I have disposed of God and I am asking you not to propose anything. So both parts of the proverb, \"Man proposes.…\" Why? Why should you propose? Proposals can be contradicted, better proposals can be produced. There is no need to propose anything. Live whatsoever you feel is right. And it is your life, nobody else's business to interfere. God I have disposed of completely. And if you don't propose, even if God is there, how can he dispose it?\nI am making a very strange and unique effort with you. Buddha was making people special, holier, higher than the layman. The layman was almost a word of condemnation. The bhikku, the sannyasin, was truly a man. The layman was not worth anything. Now, he was creating a class, helping their egos to become stronger and stronger.\nAnd these are the methods to make your ego stronger: Do things which are against nature. Do things which other people find very difficult to do. Fast, and then people will respect you. They cannot fast for seven days, and you have fasted for twenty-one days. You have done something superhuman. They cannot drop even one breakfast; they cannot live without eating for just a single day. But whatever you have done is against nature. You have tortured yourself, but it will give you a very sophisticated ego. So do things which are not natural: be celibate, which is not natural. Don't enjoy anything, because every enjoyment iS condemned.\nJainas, Buddhists, Hindus have five great principles of life which can make a man a superman. The first of those five is aswad. The word means tastelessness. Drop all taste. They are asking of you something absolutely unnatural: don't enjoy your food, don't enjoy eating anything, or, before eating it, destroy its tastefulness.\nThe Hindu monk begs from houses and then goes to the river, mixes all kinds of food into his begging bowl, gives the begging bowl a dip in the river, so whatsoever is left unmixed, the water does it, and then eats it. Now, in that begging bowl was every kind of thing -- salty, with sugar, sweets. They have all lost their taste. Now it is religious. People will worship you because you have conquered taste. All you have done is destroy a sensitivity that is part of your individuality.\nIslam is against music. Strange: \"Don't enjoy music.\" Someone is against the tongue, another is against the ear. And there are Mohammedans who have never listened to any music. Then why not become deaf? Why not give your tongue plastic surgery? Remove those small buds on your tongue which taste things -- which is so much easier and so scientific -- rather than the whole life suffering. And because these things are unnatural, you are never absolutely successful. Hence the guilt arises and hypocrisy, because you have to go on pretending that you have succeeded.\nI have been very friendly with a few Jaina monks and nuns. They had become very intimate and were almost ready to drop their monkhood. Then I came to know about a few things which no Jaina knows. These monks are not supposed to enjoy taste, but I found that in the temple where they were staying, they were keeping Coca-Cola, Fanta, hidden behind the statue of God, Mahavira. And because I was very intimate and they trusted me, they offered me their Coca- Cola. And I said, \"Great, but how do you manage?\" They said, \"A few laymen love us so much that whatsoever we say, they manage.\" They all had small transistor radios; no Jaina can suspect their monks are carrying transistor radios, listening to all kinds of film music.\nWhenever you ask people to fulfill unnatural things, you are asking for them to be guilty. So on the one hand they are creating a big ego, the ego becomes bigger, becomes a mountain; and on the other hand, side by side, a deep valley of guilt. The bigger the mountain, the bigger the valley.\nI want you to be just walking on the earth. There is no need to go to Everest. I don't want you to be anybody special. Your dress is not to make you special; on the contrary, it is to remind you that you are an ordinary human being. Behave with that ordinariness and you will be surprised that you are received and welcomed. Your ordinariness will destroy the hostility in the other person. Just go into the whole world. It is ours; why should we feel anxiety and tension in any way? By making you realize your ordinariness, I am giving you the whole kingdom of God here on the earth, and only an ordinary person can enjoy the kingdom of God.\nTry. And when I say try, I don't mean make effort. I mean give it a chance the way I am saying. Give it a chance, and something will trigger.\nI was in the university, a student of philosophy, and I was never in agreement with my professors because they were all outdated. They had studied in the universities twenty, thirty years before. In these thirty years the whole world of philosophy had changed. They had read Bradley, Bosake, Kant, Feuerbach, but they had not heard about Wittgenstein, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger. I was ahead of them, so there was continuous argument. And because I was ahead of them, they were always in trouble. They had never conceived that Kant can be criticized, that Bradley can be criticized. And after they left the university they had never touched another book of philosophy.\nSo it was an everyday trouble. I would not agree with their arguments, their arguments were so poor, and they were continuously in a nervous breakdown because the whole class was with me, and nobody was ready to agree with them. One of my professors, finding it almost impossible to manage me, one day invited the vice-chancellor, the head of the department, the assistant head of the department and all other professors of the department, almost eight persons. As I entered the class I could not believe what was the matter, because in my class there were only three students: two girls and me. What were the vice-chancellor, head of the department and other professors doing there?\nAnd the professor said, \"Now I am going to teach, and you, before all these people, bring your arguments.\" He was thinking that I would become nervous. The vice-chancellor was there, the greatest authority in the university. The head of the department was there, who could make or mar my whole future. All the other professors were there. Anybody in my place would have collapsed. His mind would have gone berserk, he would not have been able to argue.\nBut I got so ecstatic that first I thanked the vice-chancellor, the head of the department and the other professors. I said, 'I was waiting for this opportunity to show you what kind of professors you have. This man must have been dead thirty years ago. In thirty years' time philosophy has taken such quantum leaps he is not aware of. He does not know even the names of the latest philosophical minds, developments. I am grateful that he has gathered you; in fact I was going to invite you all one day, but I am lazy. So I waited for some day, but he has done my job. I am thankful to him also.\" And I told him, \"You start.\"\nHe was teaching Gautam Buddha at that time and he said, continuing, that the country in Gautam Buddha's time was so moral, so religious, so spiritual, that there was no crime, no theft, no murder. In fact, people never used locks on their houses. Even if they were going for months, their houses remained unlocked, because it was unheard of that anybody would steal. That's what Buddhist scriptures say. He asked me, \"Now what do you have to say?\"\nI said, \"They had no locks on their doors for two simple reasons: for the first, there were no locks invented. You will have to give me proof that locks existed. Otherwise, how do you suppose poor people locked their houses? You will have to give evidence that there were locks in existence. Secondly, I say to you that the people were so poor, they had nothing in their houses. Even if locks existed, they would not have been able to purchase them. And for what? -- there was nothing in the house to be stolen.\" And he turned to the vice-chancellor and said, \"You see, this is how the whole year goes by. Now what am I supposed to do?\"\nI said, \"You are not supposed to do anything, just listen to me a little more and withdraw whatever you have said. If it is true that people were rich and there was nobody who was poor, then why does Buddha continuously teach to help the poor, serve the poor? Why does he make it a great virtue? If there were no poor people, whom are you going to serve? He continuously preached for forty- two years.\n\"I can bring all the scriptures tomorrow,\" I said, \"and put them before you. Every day for forty-two years he was teaching that stealing is a great sin, never steal. If there were no thieves and everybody was a spiritual saint, who was he talking about, who was he addressing? Where could he get every day for forty-two years people he had to teach, 'Don't steal, don't be violent, don't be jealous, don't be this, that'? It certainly proves people were stealing, people were thieves, people were lying. That's why he goes on insisting, 'Don't lie, speak the truth.' What more evidence do you want?\"\nThe professor was absolutely dumb. The vice-chancellor stood up and said to the professor, \"It will be good for you to learn from that student. And if you don't have any argument, then accept his argument. It does not matter who is arguing, whether he is a professor or a student; the question is whose argument is closer to the truth.\"\nThe vice-chancellor was a retired chief justice of the high court. I thanked him. I said, \"I was expecting fairness and I am happy that you have not been unfair. You have not supported the wrong side just because he is a professor. You have supported a student.\"\nIn my whole life I have never found there is any problem, any need to be nervous, to be guilty, to be tense. But people are. Everybody is, not only you. Perhaps you will feel it more because you can immediately be distinguished by your dress, by your mala. You can immediately be distinguished, and you are standing against a thick wall of prejudice.\nBut remember: truth may be very small, but its power is almost like an atomic explosion. And howsoever big the lie may be, almost as big as God himself -- God is the lie -- a small truth is capable to expose the greatest lie.\nI don't say you need conviction, because that is a wrong word here. A Christian needs conviction, because he does not know. Don't make conviction a problem at all. Just say whatsoever you know, and just be whatsoever you are. Don't pretend to be bigger than yourself. Don't pretend to know that which you don't know.\nAlways be ready to say, \"I do not know this.\" There is no guilt in it because in fact nobody in the whole history of humanity has been able to say that he knows everything. There is always a point where he has to accept and say, \"I do not know.\" So why be afraid? We are ordinary people. If even Socrates has to say, \"I do not know,\" why can't Pratima say, \"I do not know\"? Conviction is not needed. Experience, and don't pretend beyond your experience, and you will be always at ease and relaxed.\nCan't you see me? I never think what I am going to say to you, because one thing is certain with me: if I know, I will answer; if I don't know, I will say I don't know. What is wrong in not knowing? There are limitations to everything. If I don't have to say I don't know, it is because of you. You cannot find the place, the point, the question, where I will have to say,\"I don't know.\" It is your problem, not my problem. Seek and search and try to find something that I have to answer, \"I don't know,\" and I will say it with the same strength as I say anything that I know. I will not speak out of weakness, I will not hesitate. I will not be wishy-washy, I will not try to divert the subject.\nBut to ask a question for which I have to say, \"I don't know,\" you will have to come to the same space where I am. And in that space you cannot ask. You yourself know that in this space all questions are futile and no answer is possible. People are afraid of me. Strange: I am not a Muhammad Ali, and I am not going to do any boxing, so why are they afraid of me? The journalists have been\ncontinuously asking me why people are afraid of me. They are afraid for the simple reason that whatsoever they know, they really don't know. And coming in front of me, they are going to be exposed. They will be standing utterly naked, and that is the fear.\nI am not afraid of anybody. What can anybody do to me? At the most somebody can assassinate me. To me it seems exciting. Death is bound to happen, and assassination is not a bad way, in fact perfectly suitable to a man like me. I will enjoy it. I will thank the man; I will not die before thanking him. And I will ask you that that man not be punished, because to me he has not given any pain, he has simply given me an opportunity to move beyond the body. So don't drag him to the court. Don't force him to be sentenced to death. Make history out of it: be the first people in the whole history whose Master has been assassinated, but you are not against the assassination or against the assassin. And there is every possibility the assassin will become a sannyasin, otherwise he will not be able to survive.\nDo you know what happened to Judas? He sold Jesus for only thirty pieces of silver. When Jesus was crucified, he was also expecting a miracle would happen and God would save him. And meanwhile, just being a Jew, if he has earned thirty silver pieces, what is wrong in it? Jesus is not dead; on the contrary, on the cross God fulfills his promise and Jesus is recognized as the real messiah for whom the Jews have been waiting for thousands of years.\nSo in fact I don't think he was betraying Jesus. He was just being an authentic Jew. It is all profit: Jesus will be recognized as the messiah, God will be known by thousands of people -- an opportunity which is rare -- the ultimate miracle of God descending to save Jesus will be a proof that God is, that Jesus is God's only begotten son. There is no problem in it. Judas believed it; and if he can make some money by the way, it is simply Jewish and human.\nBut the miracle did not happen. Nothing descended from the sky. Judas was hiding in the hills waiting for the miracle. When the miracle did not happen, Judas committed suicide within twenty-four hours. He felt that he had done wrong, just for thirty pieces of silver. If he had really betrayed Jesus, there was no point in his committing suicide. He felt so full of guilt that he had to punish himself with the same punishment that poor Jesus got because of him. He hanged himself from a tree.\nChristians never talk about Judas. He is a man of a certain character; I don't see anything in him that has to be condemned. He believed in Jesus, that's why he sold him. His trust was so much that he thought there was nothing wrong in getting thirty pieces of silver. Jesus was going to be saved by God. But Jesus was not saved. He must have thrown those thirty pieces of silver in the mountains and hanged himself out of sheer guilt: what has he done? As far as I can see his crucifixion by his own hand is far more significant than Jesus' crucifixion by others. Judas should be counted among the great names of world history. He is as valuable as Jesus.\nBut why did the guilt come in? It came because he was convinced. It was not his experience that Jesus was something divine. He had heard Jesus say that he was God's son, but it was not his experience. These were words repeated so often that he started believing in them. The conviction of Judas was greater than the conviction of the other apostles. But conviction is superficial. It is not that you don't have conviction, so you feel afraid; no, it is because you have certain conviction that you feel afraid.\nDo you see my point? I am emphasizing continuously: don't believe in anybody, particularly in me. Between Jesus and you is a great distance; Moses even greater. These people are just names to you. But I am not just a name. I am flesh and bones, and as real as you are. It is possible that you can start believing in me; then, that belief will create fear. Facing the hostility of others, your suspicions which you have repressed by the belief may start asserting. Perhaps, if so many people -- and the world is large -- are against Bhagwan, then who knows whether he is right or not? That hesitation will create fear in you, nervousness in you.\nI have been surprised giving interviews to the journalists, seeing that they are so nervous. And this must have been their experience also... because whomsoever they go to interview is usually nervous about what they are going to ask. They may ask questions which may create trouble. They may ask questions that if he answers them, he will be exposed; if he does not answer them, then a great suspicion will arise. People are very much afraid of journalists, very nervous. With me the experience has been totally different. And I have told Isabel, \"Now find all the journalists from all over the world, and bring each guy and I am going to give him a good heart attack. This will be his real experience of journalism.\" If I am open, you cannot expose me. If I am utterly available, if I put all my cards before you on the table, what can you do? In fact, they become nervous because they start feeling the truthfulness of what I am saying. They forget that they are here only as journalists. Their human being is also there in the same search as everybody else, in search of silence, serenity.\nOne journalist was here. His people wanted only a thirty-minute interview and it went on for two hours. His director was getting very disturbed, but the man forgot completely that he was only a journalist and he was to ask only questions in which the ordinary public and the audience would be interested. He became so involved personally, he started asking questions which were relevant to his growth. Of course the director was puzzled about what he was doing. They had prepared all the questions. He was given the list again and again, and he would hold the list, and carry on with me.\nYou need not be nervous, afraid. And remember, it is not lack of confidence. It is your belief, conviction, your confidence that you feel here in the commune, where everybody is supportive of you, nobody is hostile to you. Outside, you are alone there with hostile people. But enjoy it. My whole life I have enjoyed facing the hostile public. It is such a beautiful challenge, and if you have something to\nsay, they are going to hear it. They will have to hear it. If you have something authentic, existential, experiential, their lies will start dropping from their heads. If you are open to them, soon you will find they start becoming open to you. It is infectious.\nQ: WHY ARE WE AFRAID, AND SOMETIMES EVEN RESENT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OURSELVES, AND WE EXPECT EITHER YOU OR THE COMMUNE TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY?\nA: It is because from your very childhood you have been taught not to be responsible. You have been taught to depend. You have been taught to be responsible to your father, to your mother, to your family, to your motherland, to all kinds of nonsense. But you have not been told that you have to be responsible for yourself, that there is nobody who is going to take your responsibility.\nNo, on the contrary, your parents were taking your responsibility. Your family was taking your responsibility. The priest was taking your responsibility for your spiritual growth. You were just to follow all these people and do whatsoever they said. When you are grown up and you are no more a child, a great fear arises because you have to take responsibility and you have not been trained to take responsibility for yourself.\nYou go to confess your sin to the priest... what kind of stupidity are you doing? First, to think that you have committed sin; second, feeling guilty that you committed it; third, now you have to go to the priest to confess it, so that he can pray to God to forgive you. A simple thing has become so complex, so unnecessarily long and circuitous.\nWhatever you have done, you wanted to do it, that's why you have done it. And who is there to decide what is sin and what is not sin? There is no criterion anywhere, no weighing scale that you can go and weigh how much sin you have committed -- one kilo, two kilos, three kilos. How long a sin have you committed? -- one yard, two yards, three yards? And what was this sin, and who is this priest you are going to confess to?\nAnd this is his strategy: if you go on confessing to the priest, you are certainly afraid of him, because he knows all the ins and outs about you. The priest knows every gossip going in the town; he knows how many husbands are flirting with other people's wives, he knows who is doing what. They themselves go on confessing it. This is the priest's strategy to keep control of his congregation. You cannot leave the congregation because the priest can expose you. And also you are afraid that if you leave the congregation the priest may not ask God for you to be forgiven, and you have committed so many sins. Now it is too late. You\nhave to remain in the same herd, in the same crowd, for your whole life.\nI teach you not to be responsible to anybody; the father, the mother, the country, the religion, the party line -- don't be responsible to anybody. You are not. Just be responsible to yourself. Do whatsoever you feel like doing. If it is wrong, the\npunishment will immediately follow. If it is right, the reward will follow immediately, instantly. There is no other way.\nThis way you will start finding what is wrong, what is right, on your own. You will grow a new sensitivity -- Indians call it the third eye. You will start seeing with a new vision, a new eye. Instantly you will know what is wrong, because in the past so many times you have done it and always suffered in consequence. You will know what is right, because whenever you did existence showered great blessings on you. Cause and effect are together, they are not separated by years and lives.\nYou are responsible then. If you want and enjoy a certain act, although it brings suffering, then do it. It is good, because you enjoy it. The suffering is not big enough to deter you from the enjoyment that your act brings. But it is up to you, wholly and solely up to you to decide. If the suffering is too much and the act brings nothing, no joy, and necessarily a long anguish follows it, then it is up to you if you are an absolute idiot, and what can anybody do about it?\nThis is what I mean by being responsible to yourself. There is no God on whom you can dump your responsibility, but you are always searching to dump on somebody, even on a poor man like me, who is continuously telling you that I am not responsible for anything, for anybody. Still, somehow, deep down you go on carrying the illusion that I must be joking.\nI am not joking. He is our Master, you must be thinking, how can He say that He is not responsible? But you don't understand. Dumping your responsibility on me, you will remain retarded, childish. You will never grow. The only way to grow is to accept all good, bad, the joyful, the sorrowful. Everything that happens to you, you are responsible for. That gives you great freedom.\nIf I am responsible for something, then the key to your actions is in my hands. Then you are a slave to me. Then you are a puppet and the strings are in my hand. I say dance, you dance; I say stop, you stop. Of course, the puppet cannot be responsible for anything. The puppeteer, who is behind the screen, is always responsible.\nGod is the great puppeteer. And all these popes and saints and mahatmas are great puppets, just mediators between the big puppeteer and you. They are also puppets, but they are great puppets because they follow every single instruction from on high, absolutely. You are a little smaller puppet. Once in a while you dance on your own, too. Once in a while the puppeteer goes on pulling your strings and you don't dance.\nThe moment I say there is no puppeteer, no God, no saint, it is all rubbish, I am trying to give you total freedom. I am making you absolutely responsible for everything that happens to you or does not happen. Rejoice in this freedom. Rejoice in this great understanding that you are responsible for everything in your life. This will make you what I call the individual. And to become the individual is to know all that is worth knowing, is to experience all that is worth experiencing. To be an individual is to be liberated, is to be enlightened.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #7 Chapter title: The Time Is Short 24 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 17.]\nSwami Anand Maitreya BHAGWAN MAGAZINE, INDIA\nQUESTION: BELOVED BHAGWAN, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BECOME DISCIPLES, TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR VISION IN THIS NEW PHENOMENON. YET WE ARE AFRAID TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DEFEND THIS VISION. THE FEW PEOPLE WHO DO TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED BY SANNYASINS FOR THAT. WHY THIS CRITICISM?\nANSWER: My vision is so new, so revolutionary, that if you are all massacred for it, it will not be a surprise to me. I am fighting against the whole past of humanity. Nobody has ever done that. Christians were fighting with the Jews, Mohammedans were fighting with the Hindus, Jainas were fighting with the Buddhists; but this is happening for the first time -- one single man standing against the whole history of man. And you are choosing to be with such a man. Your participation, your devotion, your love, are towards a very dangerous man. But I don't see that the whole past -- it is vast and big -- can destroy what I am saying.\nThe past is not in my favor. I don't want it to be in my favor, I want to destroy it from the very roots. But the future is mine, the future is yours, and the future is far greater than the whole past. The forces of the future are far bigger than all the forces of the past, because the past is dead. Life knows no past. It is in the present and always moving into the future.\nPeople will be against you. People will condemn you, particularly those who are trying to materialize my vision. Don't care a bit about their criticism and their condemnation. They are just on the verge of their graves. They have failed. They have been promising man for thousands of years and all their promises have proved false. Man has remained poor, sick, starving, a slave to so many things, imprisoned, chained. They have driven man almost to madness. They have completely failed.\nNaturally, they will be offended by your small successes. They have not even been able to achieve small victories. Just your very presence is offensive to them for the simple reason that you are rejoicing, enjoying, loving, and they have never loved, they have never enjoyed. They have always been guilty, feeling the burden of so many sins. How can they dance? When you see their situation, you will be able to forgive them for their condemnation. They have missed their life, and you are not missing a single moment.\nThey are jealous of you. Their condemnation and criticism arise out of their jealousy. When everybody else is depressed, you are dancing. You are taking a risk. Those depressed people will not allow you to dance. They will try to prevent you. They will start telling others that you are mad.\nI have heard a story about a faraway mountain land where a community of blind people lived. Nobody was born blind, but there was a certain fly whose bite made the person immediately blind. Every child was born with eyes, but those flies were there all around. It was impossible to escape from those flies. All the older people, the adults, the mothers and fathers, could not do anything -- they were all blind. The whole community was blind.\nThe fly affected only a certain age-group, below five years of age. Five years is a long time for a child, and the fly was all around. Within those five years... any moment. In fact, within six months every child was blind; those flies were not waiting for five years.\nFor the first time, a stranger came into the community from faraway lands. He was an adventurer. Seeing from the hilltop thousands of blind people, he could not believe his own eyes. He felt immensely sorry for them. He forgot about his further exploration in the mountains and he remained with those people. He wanted to help them somehow. He wanted to find what had happened. It is acceptable that in thousands of people there may be one man blind -- that he knew -- but in thousands of people not a single man with eyes? -- it was a great challenge for him. He wanted to find out what was the matter, what had happened.\nSoon he was able to find out that every child was born with eyes, and every child became blind within six months. He discovered the fly, too, which was a common fly. But while he was doing this research, why these poor people had all gone blind, he fell in love with a blind girl. She was immensely beautiful. He had seen beauty before, but this girl's beauty was a category in itself, incomparable. Although she was blind, she looked like a marble statue made not by any amateur, but by some Leonardo da Vinci.\nThe girl was still unmarried. A great problem arose in the community, because never before had it happened that anybody from their community had married somebody, particularly a stranger -- and more emphatically, a man who is mad because he thinks he has eyes. But they were simple mountain people, they did not want to make these two young people miserable.\nThe community agreed that the man could marry the girl, but first he had to become blind. Then he would be one of them, no more a stranger. First he had to drop that madness that he had eyes -- who had ever heard about eyes? -- if he was not willing to drop that insane idea, then the marriage was not possible. He was not only a stranger, he was insane too. The man so loved the girl that he destroyed his eyes. In his life, for the first time, love became blind. For love he became blind.\nWhy could those people not accept that he had eyes? It was against the egos of the whole community. They were blind and he had eyes. He was somebody special, so either he was mad, imagining, hallucinating about eyes, or perhaps he had eyes. But then he could not be tolerated, allowed to continue to have eyes, because he would remain a stranger, an outsider, and the very idea that he had eyes made everyone feel inferior. The day he destroyed his eyes and said, \"I have dropped that idea of being a man with eyes,\" there was great rejoicing, dancing, singing.\nThis is the situation. This is my situation. This is your situation. On your own accord you have become part of my caravan. I had started alone; then people went on coming, and the caravan went on becoming bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Now we are a reality the world cannot tolerate. They will condemn you, they will curse you, they will criticize you -- but they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that they are mere ghosts of the past.\nThey are not living people. They can make much noise, but you just have to remember that they are dead and that the future does not belong to them. They can look backwards into the past. They can sing songs of glory about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Mahavira, but they don't have any eyes for the future. They don't have even eyes for the present. And to have eyes for the past is absolutely meaningless, because the past is no more. It is dead, it is a long, long graveyard. And suddenly you come and start dancing and singing and celebrating. It hurts their egos. It makes them feel inferior. When they have missed joy, how dare you dance and sing? And for what? They know only one thing, that you can be happy. But for happiness you need a certain cause... and I am teaching you that happiness is your nature. You don't need any cause.\nIt is not that when you win a lottery of one million dollars, you give a big party, wine and women and dance. This will be understood. I am saying you need not win any lottery, you need no cause to be blissful. Blissfulness is your very nature. Sadness needs a certain cause. Bliss is free of all causality. Once you have understood it, you become a participant in a new way of life, a way so new that it is discontinuous with the past.\nBut you have to understand that all those poor people who have missed are going to be angry with you. In their criticism, in their condemnation, there is nothing but jealousy, anger. They cannot believe that you can be right, because for millions of years they have lived the life of sadness and sorrow and suddenly a few strangers arrive on the earth as if from another planet and start doing\nthings which have never been done. They would like to destroy you so they feel comfortable; they would like that you are not. They will feel a certain satisfaction that whatever they are is the only reality, that there is no other reality.\nBut they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that you are living. You are vital energy and they are spent cartridges. They can shoot you with their guns, but their guns are full of spent cartridges. They cannot destroy you. Life is so strong and death is so weak. Joy is so strong and sadness is just a shadow. You are undefeatable.\nWhen they condemn you, enjoy that, too. When they criticize you, sing a song as a response to their criticism, and don't pay much attention to them. Ignore them. Anyway, they are going down, drowning. Don't waste your time arguing with drowning people. You continue your dance, and you go on spreading your dance. Religion, in the authentic, true sense, is here.\nYou may not be aware that you are participating in something which is so important that nothing like it has ever happened before. And because you are capable, intelligent, you can forgive them. Not to let them feel inferior, you can forgive them, knowing that they are on their deathbed and you are just starting to grow and live and flower. There is no comparison.\nOne journalist has asked if my commune can live in coexistence with the neighbors. In the first place, there are no neighbors, we are alone on the earth. Ghosts are not neighbors, graveyards are not neighborhoods. Those dead people, although they are still breathing, are not alive. Just to breathe is not enough to claim life. Much more is needed.\nJust to breathe is to vegetate -- even trees are breathing. Being able to walk is not much; animals and even a few trees can walk. In Africa, trees walk miles away from their place of origin to find new sources of water. Of course it is a very slow journey, but they go on spreading their roots, and slowly go on moving miles away to where they can find water, miles away to where they can find open sky, the sun.\nYes, these people we are surrounded with are breathing, walking, eating, doing all kinds of things which any robot is capable of doing. Any mechanical device will be able to do all that these people are doing, but no robot can feel joy without any cause. No robot can be meditative and experience silence, ecstasy, blissfulness. What coexistence can there be between living, overflowing people and the dead? -- or the nearly dead, which is even worse. If you are dead, at least a misery is finished, a long tragedy has come to an end; but nearly dead, almost dead, life is not there but the tragedy continues. They have enough energy for misery. Misery does not need much energy. You cannot say that you are so weak you cannot be miserable. Can you say that? -- that I am feeling so weak today that I cannot feel miserable?\nMisery needs no energy. It is easy, cheap, costs nothing. But to be blissful, to be dancing and singing, to be a joy to yourself and others, certainly you need energy, more energy than is needed only for survival. If a tree gets enough\nenergy just to survive, it will not flower. No fruits will come for the simple reason that flowering is an overflowing of energy. The tree has so many colors within it, so much fragrance that it cannot contain it anymore. It has to be shared with existence, with the sun, with the moon, with the wind, with the birds. That's how flowers come and open up. That's how it gives you fruits -- it has so much life energy that it can give.\nThese people who condemn you because you have become a participant with a man who is against the whole past of man, just forgive them. They do not know that they are being foolish. Rather than wasting their energy in condemnation and criticism, they should come closer to you, know you better, feel you deeper; because if this ecstasy is possible to you, it is possible to them also. Howsoever late, it is still possible.\nThere is a proverb in India: if you get lost in the morning but somehow manage to come back home by the evening, you are not lost. These people you are surrounded by are coming closer and closer to evening, but they are still far away from home. And if they could not find home in the sunlight, it cannot be conceived that they can find home when the sun has set and the darkness of night covers the earth.\nThat darkness is not far away. Its name is the third world war. Every moment we are coming closer to it. That is going to be the night, unending, perhaps forever and forever. It is going to destroy all that is living and all possibility for life to exist on this planet. It has happened on other planets; it is now a recognized scientific fact that there are planets which give indications that some day life had existed there. How it disappeared nobody knows, but soon we will know how it disappears.\nBut there is time still, even if the sun is setting, there is time still. Those people, if they are intelligent, will come and try to mix with you, so that they can understand where they got lost, where they missed the right path.\nSo remember, those who are intelligent are going to become participants in this caravan. Those who are retarded will criticize you, condemn you. Ignore them. They are already stepping into their graves, soon they will disappear. They don't have any vision for the future, they don't have any solution for the problems that the past has created.\nEvery day more and more problems are being created by their past, and not a single solution. We don't have any problems from the past, any hangups. And we can see clearly that all their problems can be solved. But they are blind and deaf; they cannot listen, they cannot see. Perhaps they don't want to see, they don't want to listen because that will make them feel more inferior. They want to continue to feel that they are superior beings, that the problems are bad, the problems are insoluble, but they are doing their best. If the problems still remain, what can they do?\nI want to say to you that those problems are their creations. With one hand they go on creating the problem, with the other they go on trying to solve it. Their\nright hand knows not what their left hand is doing. I have not come across a single problem which cannot be solved right now. But they have their vested interests -- and if the problem is solved, then what will happen to their vested interests? So they go on talking about solving the problem -- poverty, war, disease, death -- but just talking, and they have been talking for thousands of years. Their philosophers have been thinking, creating great treatises, but what is the outcome? What is the outcome of that whole genius of the past? How have Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Bradley, Bosake helped to solve any human problems? Has Mohammed, or Jesus, or Buddha, or Mahavira been able to give any solution so that man can live at peace?\nNo. On the contrary, they all created more problems, they added more problems. The older ones were there, they created new ones with their so-called solutions. It is really very surprising and amazing to see into the past and to see the people who have been adored in the past, respected like gods. And what is their contribution? Nobody asks.\nWhat has Krishna given to the world? Nothing at all. Yes, a few problems, certainly. He has given the idea to the Hindus that they are the right people, that everybody else is wrong in the world. Hindus think they are the purest race, everybody else is impure. Hindus go on saying that it is a great blessing, that they are fortunate to be born as Hindus. To be born as Christians or Mohammedans would have been a condemnation from the very beginning. Unless you have committed some great sins in the past, how can you become a born Mohammedan, a born Christian? All the virtuous people are born brahmins, Hindus.\nBut the same kind of idea is given by these so-called geniuses to everybody. Jesus says to Christians the same stupid thing: You are the very promise, all God's hopes are with you. Everybody has gone wrong, now only you can help people to come to the right path. Moses says to the Jews: You are the chosen people of God. You are born to rule over the world.\nNow, what is the difference between Moses and Adolf Hitler? From where did he get this idea that German Nordics are the purest Aryan race in the world and they have, by their very birth, the right to rule over the world? Adolf Hitler must have got it from Moses. Perhaps that's why he killed one million Jews.\nYou will be wondering what the relation is between them. It is very simple. What Hitler is claiming is also being claimed by Moses. Those claims are going to be clashed against each other -- either the Jews are to rule the world, or the German Nordics. Both cannot rule the world, both cannot be the purest and the highest race. Something had to be decided, and he decided. By killing one million Jews, he made it clear to them who is higher, more powerful, stronger.\nReligious leaders, political leaders, they are all sailing in the same boat. I see man's whole past as utterly impotent. It has not contributed more beauty to the world, more joy to beings, more health, more happiness. It has not been creative. It has been simply destructive. I am totally against it.\nIt has been asked by very scholarly professors, \"As you are a rational person, how can you say that everything in the past is wrong? Something must be right, too. There must be something that is good in Buddha's approach, something good in Jesus' approach. You may not agree with their total message, but to deny the total message -- not of one person, one country, one culture, not of one civilization, but of all the civilizations, all the cultures, all the prophets, all the messiahs, all the religions!\"\nThis professor was the professor of Buddhism in Benares University. His name was Bhikshu Jagdish Kashyap -- he said, \"You are a rational man. I cannot see how you can say this.\" I said to him that just because I am a rational man I can say it, and also can prove it.\nYes, there are things in Buddha which look beautiful. There are words of Jesus which look beautiful. But remember one thing: Jesus is one organic whole, his good words cannot be separated from his bad deeds. Buddha has to be taken as a whole, because whatsoever he says and does is interconnected. You cannot just cut pieces from different people, the good ones, the nice ones, and make a living culture out of it. That is impossible. In the first place, the moment you take a small piece from Mohammed, it is already dead. It was alive in the Mohammedan context. Once it loses that context it has no meaning at all.\nFor example, Jesus says: Blessed are those who are the last in this world, because they will be the first in my kingdom of God. A beautiful sentence. To find something wrong with such a beautiful sentence is difficult. Even enemies of Jesus cannot do that.\nI am not an enemy, neither am I a friend. I am simply looking with open eyes, with no emotional antagonism, favoritism. He says: Blessed are those who are the last. But how many people can be the last? If the whole humanity is standing in a queue, one man will be the last; and if humanity is standing in a circle, then it will be impossible to find who is the last. And how do you determine? What is the criterion to decide who is the last?-the beggar?\nBuddha was a beggar. Do you have the guts to say that he is the last? He had nothing but his begging bowl, that was his only possession, but you cannot say he is the last. He was so magnificent a person that you can only put him as the first -- this world or that does not matter. And Jesus is saying this thing without considering how long humanity has existed. How many people would have been the last in each generation? And why were they last in the first place? They had no intelligence, they had no strength, they had no guts to move. These will be the first in the kingdom of God? -- then in the kingdom of God only idiots will be found, and those who are intelligent, geniuses, they will be thrown into hell because they were never the last.\nA beautiful sentence, but if you start thinking and dissecting it, you find that you will have to accept Jesus' whole theology. Only in that context can that sentence have any meaning.\nBuddha says beautiful things but also says stupid things. Now, I cannot conceive of a man doing both things together. On the one hand he says that men and women are equal; on the other hand he is not willing to initiate women into sannyas. Now what to make of it? If they are equal, then why are you preventing the equal people equal opportunity?\nCertainly they are not equal. Your action proves they are not equal. You initiate the most idiotic man and you are not willing to initiate the most intelligent woman. Then, when you say men and women are equal, it seems to be just a political, diplomatic statement. It has no value. You yourself have canceled it completely.\nI have looked into the past, I have tried my best to find something. It is always connected with something which is ugly. Now the Hindu god Rama is a beautiful person, if you are not very alert. If you are very alert, you will find that this man is an enemy of humanity. His wife was stolen by another king. Three years he had to fight to get the wife back. Poets and Hindu saints praise him because he respected womanhood so much that he fought for three years. Otherwise, in those days, who bothered? Every king had many wives, who cares if one is lost? It looks right, the man must be very respectful towards women.\nBut the same man when he is victorious, when he takes out his wife Sita from the imprisonment of the enemy king, the first words that he says destroy him completely. He says: Listen, woman -- he is not even saying, My dear, my darling. Three years of separation, and the word he uses is derogatory -- \"Listen, woman, I have not fought this war for you. I have fought this war for my own prestige, for my kingdom's prestige, for my forefathers' prestige. It is not a question of you, so don't get a big head because Rama fought for you for three years.\"\nThese are ugly words. And then he is known to have forced the woman to pass through fire to prove that she is pure, that she has not made love to the enemy king. In the first place, it is such a stupid idea that the fire will judge whether the woman is pure or not.\nYou can try it. Do a small experiment. Speak something absolutely truthfully. Speak something which cannot be in any way untrue. Say the time in your clock at this moment, and put your hand just on a candle flame to see whether you are true or not. And you will know that the candle flame does not bother whether your clock is there or not, whether you are saying the truth or untruth. It is going to burn you. Then try a lie, anything that cannot be true in any possible way, that two and two make five, and put your hand on the flame. See whether it burns you more, less, or the same. Fire has its own laws.\nNow, putting this poor woman who has been three years in prison waiting to see her husband, crying and weeping... this is the welcome. And I do not understand how she becomes impure even if she has made love. On what grounds is she impure? And, secondly, Rama himself was three years without his wife. He also should have walked through fire to prove his purity. That he does not do. This is\nstrange, that only the woman has to be pure, and man need not bother about such small things. You ask the wife to be pure, at least you should have the courage to go through the same test.\nThe story is beautiful. Sita passes through the fire, is not burned by the fire. It cannot be an historical fact, but just for argument's sake we accept that she survived the fire. But it did not make Rama any more respectful towards her.\nWhen they reached their capital, one washerman, just one washerman, condemned -- that too in his privacy -- his wife, because she had not been home the whole night. In the morning when she came, he was angry, started beating her, and told her, \"This won't do. Where have you been the whole night? With whom? And remember, I am not Rama that I will accept you. One night is enough, now get out of here. I am not Rama, who accepted Sita after three years.\" The message was brought to Rama by one of his people who was passing and heard the washerman's statement, that one man in the capital was shouting loudly, \"I am not Rama. I cannot tolerate such things\" -- and this was enough.\nWhat happened about the fire test? Rama renounced Sita again, and sent her back into the forest, into an ashram. He abandoned her. And Hindus go on saying that this must be something right, unless there is nothing right. Then people like Mahatma Gandhi continuously worshipped Rama. His last words were, \"Ah, Rama!\" when he was shot dead. But the way Rama behaved with his wife was just ugly, inhuman. She was pregnant, and she was thrown into the forest, abandoned. For what? Again it was a question of prestige.\nOne man has suspected her integrity. I don't see the point. If he thought that it\nwas a question of prestige, he should have gone with Sita to the forest and renounced the kingdom -- \"I don't care about the kingdom, I love the woman. I love her purity. I put her under the fire test, now what more I can do?\" But no, the kingdom was too precious. The prestige of the family was too precious, and just one idiot washerman was enough to make a statement and Sita was abandoned.\nNow, whatsoever good things this man may have said and done -- I have looked into everything minutely, and I have tried to find something good that can be taken out -- I am puzzled, because with that good thing so many things are joined absolutely. You choose it, you choose all that which is connected with it organically.\nIt is not a hasty judgment on my part that I abandon the whole past of humanity. For almost forty years I have been continuously trying to be fair and to find something that can be saved. But I'm sorry to say to you that there is nothing. It is far better to start humanity anew, from the very scratch, fresh.\nNaturally, you will be in danger. I am in danger. I have put myself in danger, this is my responsibility. You have become my participant; that is not my responsibility, that is your responsibility. I have made it clear to you that being with me is dangerous. Still you choose to be with me. It is your responsibility.\nI don't want to take your responsibility, because with responsibility goes your freedom, too. That's how things are connected. You will feel good if I say, \"I will take your responsibility, don't be worried.\" You will feel good, not knowing that your freedom is finished. Now I am the Master and you are simply a follower. I have reduced you into a certain inferiority. No, I cannot do that.\nI am a master of myself, but you are not my followers. My mastery does not depend on your following. It depends on my experience. Even if all the followers are gone, I will still be the same Master. You are not my followers. I emphasize it again and again that you are my fellow travelers, that I am doing something risky, that I am walking on the razor's edge. And you have chosen to be with me, with full responsibility and freedom. Then you are not inferior and I am not superior.\nI want to destroy all kinds of inequalities in the world. They are all the same -- man is higher, the woman is lower; the white man is higher, the black man is lower; the Master is higher, the disciple is lower. I want a very simple fact to be recognized: Everybody is unique, incomparable. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower.\nLet the whole world condemn; the victory is going to be ours, because we are the people of the rising sun and they are hanging around the sunset. Soon they will disappear into the darkness and be lost forever. And the sooner it happens, the better. But you have a vast future ahead of you, a tremendous opportunity to create man again, because the old man has failed, and the new man is needed urgently. We are living in one of the hottest times. There has never been such an emergency before. The time is short and the job is immense. But, if you are intelligent, silent, blissful, it can be done.\nAnd it can be done without any hardship. It can be done almost as if it is fun, and I don't want you to be serious. I want to create the new man in a very nonserious way, playfully. The old man was serious. I don't want even that connection with the new man. The new man must be playful, nonserious. No God, no hell, no heaven, nobody to impose what is right and what is wrong except your own awareness to decide and then to accept the consequences.\nI love one of the statements of a Baul fakir -- baul means a mad man. His name was Chandidas. He says, Sabar upar manus satya, tahar upar nahin. \"Above all is the truth of man, and above that there is nothing.\" No God, no heaven, no hell. He was condemned as a madman, and he was saying one of the basic fundamentals. You will be condemned, you will be cursed, you will be criticized, but you cannot be defeated, because the time is with you. The future is with you. Only the new man can survive. The old man is almost fading away. Say goodbye to the old man, he has done enough nuisance on the earth. It is time that the new man takes over and does not repeat the old mistakes.\nQ: BELOVED BHAGWAN, THE MIND IS AN EXPLOITER OF EVERY SITUATION. EVEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SITUATION OF BEING AROUND\nYOU IS EXPLOITED IN TERMS OF HIGHER AND LOWER, SPECIAL AND NON-SPECIAL, MORE MEDITATIVE AND LESS MEDITATIVE, CLOSER AND NOT CLOSE. HOW CAN AVOID THESE EXPLOITATIONS?\nA: There is not much difficulty in it. Simply drop the whole idea.\nI am teaching you every day that there is nothing higher, nothing lower. It is simply man's ego creating if not money, if not politics, then meditation. The ego can exploit any situation, but it will play the same game. One is higher in meditation, the other is lower in meditation. One is an older sannyasin, senior -- as if it is a government bureaucracy -- and the other one is a new fellow. You can tolerate him, but he is not to be considered much, not to be taken seriously. It is the same ego, you just have to watch.\nIt is the same ego. Whenever it creates any comparison and brings the qualities of higher and lower and judgments, immediately cut its head, then and there. Take a deep breath and drop it. Exhale it! And it is only a question of a few days and the wrong habit disappears. It is only a wrong habit, nothing to be worried about, a hangover from the old society where everything is compared, everything is put in a certain hierarchic system.\nYou have come from the old society with much junk from the old society within you. Be alert and go on cleansing yourself of the old, of the past, of all you have brought with you. Become emptier, become cleaner. And it feels so beautiful. It feels so ecstatic that I can only be silent about it. I cannot say anything about it.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #8 Chapter title: Commune Is The Way 25 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 18.]\nDenise Kovacevic KATU TV, CHANNEL 2 PORTLANDS, OREGON\nQUESTION: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME OUT TO SPEAK WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.\nANSWER: Thank you.\nQ: PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTION ON MY MIND IS, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR RELIGION, THAT PEOPLE FIND SO APPEALING? WE SEE PEOPLE LIKE ISABEL AND SHEELA AND SARITA AND K.D., PEOPLE THAT WE THINK ARE LIKE OURSELVES, AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE HERE, AND WE ASK OURSELVES, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE THAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE?\nA: It is very simple. I am so ordinary a man that nobody can feel any inferiority with me. And all the so-called religious leaders of the world were nothing but egoists, making everybody feel inferior, guilty, sinners. I don't make anybody feel guilty. If he feels guilty already, just coming to me his guilt disappears. I transform sinners into saints instantly, and that's what appeals to them -- that I am one of them, and they're my fellow travelers, not my followers.\nI am nobody's leader. They are not sheep and I am not their shepherd. I am just a human being, as they are. And my emphasis is that every human being has the birthright to become enlightened. This is nothing special.\nQ: BUT ARE YOU REALLY AN ORDINARY MAN? WHEN WE SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE COMMUNE AND WHO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY OF LIFE, THEY SEEM TO WORSHIP YOU, AND THEY TREAT YOU WITH REVERENCE, THEY TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT THAT, PERHAPS, THEY WOULD NOT TREAT OTHER PEOPLE. SO DO YOU REALLY CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ORDINARY MAN? YOU CALL YOURSELF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE.\nA: I am. I don't consider, I don't think. I am just an ordinary man. And that's why they adore me. They have adored for centuries people who are just egoists, people who have been deceiving them, calling themselves prophets, messiahs, only begotten son of God, and all kinds of nonsense. They are intelligent enough to see that I am not putting any burden on them. I am trying to remove all burden. I am saying to them continuously there is no need to worship me, because I am just amongst you. There is no need for adoration.\nQ: BUT THEY DO GIVE IT, AND THEY DO NOT TREAT YOU AS AN EQUAL.\nA: That is the problem. The more I try to be nobody, the more they love me. Now what do you propose I should do?\nQ: I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT THEIR LEADER, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THEM? DO YOU JUST SET AN EXAMPLE? WHAT DO YOU OFFER THEM?\nA: I don't offer them anything except myself. I am available to them. I have no secrets. I am completely open. All the prophets and the messiahs had secrets, esoteric philosophies. I have none.\nBut I say to them that being nothing, nobody, brings you all the blessings of the world. And just being close to me, slowly they start feeling also that they are nobodies, nobody is special. And the moment one feels he is nobody, the whole existence starts pouring immense blissfulness. It showers on him like flowers. And once you have known the secret, that is how you can commune with existence.\nWith your ego you cannot commune with existence; you are separating yourself. With no ego, there is communion. And that communion is enlightenment. That is real godliness. I don't have any God to offer them, but certainly I can show them the way to godliness. And remember, godliness is nothing special. It is our birthright, we just have to claim it.\nIt has been said for centuries, again and again, that you have to earn virtue. It will take many times, many lives for you to reach the kingdom of God. They have made it very far away, it is always beyond death. I say to my people that this is sheer stupidity. They were exploiting people's gullibility. They were exploiting people s hope.\nI am saying to them that there is nothing beyond this moment. Don't wait for any Godot. Live this moment in its totality and squeeze the whole juice out of it. And if the next moment comes, do the same to it. Go on squeezing each moment and you will be surprised that unawares you have entered into paradise. In this very\nlife, here and now, existence knows only one tense: the present. It knows no past, it knows no future.\nSo I simply help them to be here and now, getting more rooted in the present, and then everything becomes possible. And it is not a question of deserving God. We are part of existence already. It is not a question of earning. No virtue is needed, because it is not a bargain, not a business. Just we have to be a little quiet, silent, so we can hear the still small voice within. And we can also hear the silent music that surrounds the whole existence.\nAnd that I call godliness. There is no God, but there is certainly a quality of tremendous beauty, grace, love.\nQ: SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY: IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO BE A SANNYASIN? I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE: MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS. THEY BELIEVE THAT CHRIST IS THE SAVIOR, THE MESSIAH. CHRISTIANS TRY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN SET OF STANDARDS. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING BRIEF LIKE THAT FOR HOW SANNYASINS LIVE?\nA: I don't have anything like that. I don't have any catechism, any dogma. I don't offer any principles, any philosophy, any theology. My sannyasins live individual lives in freedom.\nQ: SO THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD SANNYASIN, LIKE THERE IS A BAD CHRISTIAN, OR...?\nA: No. There is no good sannyasin, there is no bad sannyasin; there are only sannyasins. Good and bad are ugly words and I have dissolved them completely. Here is no judgment. Everybody has to be responsible for himself, his freedom and whatsoever he wants to do with his life. So it is difficult for me, impossible, to explain to the outside people how a sannyasin is. The only way is to invite him to be here, live with the sannyasins, experience what they are going through. Taste it -- their fragrance will be my explanation. The taste of being with the sannyasins is my theology. Those people will have to come to the well, the well does not go to the thirsty.\nQ: SO, IF THERE IS NO GOOD AND BAD AND NO JUDGING, HOW DOES ONE KNOW IF HE IS IMPROVING? OR IS THERE EVEN A NEED TO IMPROVE? OR IS THAT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL? OKAY, AM I HAPPY WITH WHAT I AM DOING NOW, AM I HAPPY WITH THE LEVEL I AM AT NOW?\nA: I do not teach that you have to become somebody other than what you are. No improvement is needed. No goal is there to be achieved. Whatever you need is already provided by existence each moment. It is up to you how to use it, or not to use it.\nQ: YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BIBLE. I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS ALMOST SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IN THE BIBLE: THAT ANSWERS ARE THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THEM. EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED IS HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO IT. THE ANSWERS ARE ALL THERE.\nA: No, it is not in the Bible. You don't know anything about the Bible. In the Bible it is said, seek and ye shall find, ask and you will receive the answer, knock and the door shall be opened. This is totally against what I am saying. I am saying, seek and you will miss. Do not seek because it is here right now. In seeking you will forget the moment which is slipping by. Do not ask because you are the answer. Why become a question? It is simply stupid to become a question when you can become the answer.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY OF LIFE?\nA: I don't care. I simply allow them their freedom -- nor do I subscribe to their philosophy, their religion. It is perfectly right they don't subscribe. But we are not at all worried about them. They are worried about us. That makes the difference. Somehow they are troubled by us. We are not troubled.\nQ: DOES THAT AMUSE YOU?\nA: Yes, it amuses me immensely. It is our whole entertainment. Their worry, their concern, their continuous curiosity makes it clear that whatever philosophy, theology, religion they belong to, it is not giving them what they want. It is not making them joyful. It is not making them sing, dance. It is not giving them anything substantial, any nourishment.\nThat is the reason they go on looking, perhaps somewhere else.… They are curious, but also afraid, because they have been conditioned. They have lived according to a certain dogma. A man who has lived for seventy years according to a certain dogma is in a really big mess if he comes across sannyasins. He can see there are people who are happy, dancing, singing for no reason at all. To dance is enough, a reason unto itself. To sing is enough, you need not be rewarded for it in heaven. In the very singing of it you are rewarded.\nThey can see these people are happy. That makes them curious. But they are afraid to come too close, because of their seventy years' devotion to Christ, to the Bible. They don't want to recognize the fact that for seventy years they have been idiotic, not Christian. They have been calling their stupidity Christianity. It needs guts to come close to my sannyasins. Those who have guts, they are coming, from all over the world. Those who have no guts, let them go to hell. It is none of our business to interfere in their journey, in their pilgrimage to hell. Let them go.\nQ: HOW MANY SANNYASINS ARE THERE NOW THROUGHOUT THE WORLD? WE HAD HEARD THAT PERHAPS YOUR NUMBERS WERE SHRINKING AND THERE WERE NOT AS MANY.\nA: Never shrinking. We are always expanding. But we don't bother about numbers, we don't even have an exact account of how many people are there. But they are every day growing; around the world in every center people are taking sannyas, joining communes. There are almost eight hundred thousand sannyasins.\nAnd a few have left; they can be counted very easily on ten fingers... a dozen or two dozen people. And even though they have left, they are in tremendous trouble, because once a sannyasin, you cannot again become part of the old world. Now they are in a limbo. They cannot mix with the old world. I have already deprogrammed them. They cannot go to the church and listen to the sermon without thinking this is idiotic. They cannot come back because of their egos. Now that they have left, how should they approach Bhagwan again? I would like them to know that the doors are open. Nobody is going to ask you why you had left. We never ask anybody why they have come.\nQ: IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN TOP, OR VISIBLE POSITIONS ANYWAY, IN THE COMMUNE AND WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND THE RELIGION ARE WOMEN. WHY? HOW DID THAT COME TO BE?\nA: Certainly. Because I am a man.\nQ: AND WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU?\nA: Certainly. I love them. I love you.\nQ:... AND WE HAVE ONLY MET.… DO YOU THINK THAT -- THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING -- DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN ARE NECESSARILY BETTER THAN OR MORE IMPORTANT THAN, OR PERHAPS SMARTER THAN MEN?\nA: They are lovelier, delicious, tasteful. And they have been repressed for centuries, that's why they appear not to be so intelligent as men. Otherwise, they are exactly equally as intelligent as men. And more earthly than the man. Man is always a moongazer: the woman doesn't care about the moon. She cares about the earth, her concern is very practical.\nAnd I am creating a certain way of life which is not schizophrenic, which does not divide materialism from spiritualism, a life in which materialism and spiritualism are together -- not as enemies, not as contradictories, but as complementaries. And one has to begin from the earth. Even if you have to go to the moon, you have to begin from the earth. The woman is very earthly. I don't need moongazers, I need very earthly people. And the woman gives roots to you. A man without a woman is without roots.\nQ: IS THERE A SPECIAL WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE? OR DO YOU HAVE MANY?\nA: I have so many that it is very difficult to say who is special. In this moment you are. It is moment to moment.\nQ: WELL, OKAY, OTHER THAN THIS MOMENT, IS THERE A COMPANION THAT YOU SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH?\nA: No. I don't make any contracts, particularly about love, because love is a very delicate phenomenon. It is just like the wind. A cool breeze comes in and passes from the other door. You cannot catch hold of it, you can enjoy it, but if you try to catch hold of it you miss the moment of enjoyment. In a closed fist there is no wind. If you want to enjoy, keep the fist open.\nI have no contract with anybody. I never promise anything. Because I don't know if tomorrow I will be there or not. And who knows, the next moment somebody else enters into my life, and I am enchanted. I never make any promise.\nQ: HOW CAN SOMETHING SO FLEETING GIVE A MAN ROOTS THEN?\nA: It gives you roots. It is not that you love one woman, then you will get roots. What gives you roots is that you love. Lovers can change but your love remains. And that gives you roots. That is permanent, that is not a fleeting thing. I have always loved. Addresses have changed, but I have been writing love letters my whole life. That gives roots, and that gives you a very beautiful centering and a feeling of earthliness. From there you have to start to grow, just like a tree. The phenomenon of the tree is exactly similar to what I call my religion. (BHAGWAN SPEAKS TO THE VIDEO CREW) Change it. There, you see? No contract even with the film. In the middle of a sentence the film changes... what to do?\nA tree is exactly symbolic of what my religion is. The tree grows roots deep under the earth. The deeper the roots go, the higher the tree stands up. It is equal, proportionate. If the tree wants to reach to the stars then the roots will have to reach to the very hell.\nMy commune is a very balanced phenomenon. There are more women than men, for the simple reason that I am preparing the earth. Men are coming. Soon you will see equal numbers. But they can come only, the trees can grow upwards only, when the ground is ready. The woman is of tremendous importance.\nQ: WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN PLAY?\nA: The children are the commune's. They are not yours or mine. In the first place my approach is that the world is already overpopulated, so don't burden it anymore. And science has given you the greatest revolution in human history, the pill, which makes you absolutely capable of making love just a play, a fun, a game. There is no need to be serious about it anymore. In the past, of course, people were serious, because children will come, and who is going to take care of the children? So first my emphasis is, remember, the earth is already too burdened and we have to unburden it. So in four years' time, in my commune not a single child has been born. Although four sannyasins have died, we have not even replaced the four sannyasins with four children.\nQ: IN HOW MANY YEARS?\nA: In four years.\nSecondly, there are children, because when sannyasins come, a few sannyasins come with children. When they became sannyasins they were already mothers and fathers. Those children are here, but the commune is responsible. We remove the responsibility from father and mother. We make them free, unburdened. Their children are there, they can love them, they can live with them, they can go to them, they can call them, but they belong to the commune. If they don't care about their children, the children are not going to suffer in any way. The children have the whole commune of uncles, aunts, and they go on making friends with different kinds of people.\nThis is a tremendous education and a great preparation for a rich life. It is an established fact that the boy loves his mother and the girl loves her father. But this kind of love remains only in the mind. The boy cannot make love to the mother. That is unimaginable. The boy fantasizes but goes on repressing it, feels guilty. The girl feels guilty. You can see small girls flirting with their fathers. It is natural; he is the only man she knows from the very beginning.\nThis is a very significant thing, because the girl becomes impressed with the idea of men according to the image she carries of her father. And the same with the boy: his whole life he will remain frustrated. He will not find the right woman\nfor the simple reason that it is always his mother that he is looking for, unknowingly, unconsciously.\nWhen he falls in love, he cannot say why he has fallen in love with this particular woman, but psychologists know perfectly well. Something in this woman resembles his mother -- perhaps the color of the hair, the style of her dress, the way she walks, the sound of her voice, her eyes, her face, her color -- anything. But something resembles the mother so much that the boy has fallen in love. But the woman soon will not be able to fulfill all the demands that the boy is going to make, that he was making on the mother. And soon he is going to discover that she only walks like his mother, but she is not the woman he was seeking, searching.\nIn the commune we destroy this neurosis completely, because the child goes on moving with many aunts, many uncles. And remember, father and mother are later additions to language. Uncle and aunt are far more ancient; because there was a time when there was no family, so everybody of the age of the father was an uncle. Nobody knew exactly who was the father.\nI would like my commune's children not to be focused on one figure, but to have a rich experience of many women, many men, so they have only a general, vague feeling which can fit with any woman, any man.\nQ: HOW WERE YOU RAISED? WERE YOU RAISED IN THE SAME WAY?\nA: No. How I could be raised in the same way? I had to fight for it. I had to struggle for it. I was raised in a family, but the family never thought that I belonged to them, because I never listened to them.\nIn fact I had made it clear that if they want me to do something they should keep quiet. If they say they want me to do it, then I'm not going to do it. Then I will do just the opposite, because I don't want to be ordered in my life, and I don't receive anyone's commandments. I told them, \"If you want to throw me out of the house you can. This is your house. Remember, I am born through you, but I have my own individuality and I have to discover it on my own. Your orders will not help me.\"\nSoon they became understanding, because how long could they fight? And slowly they started understanding what I was saying. Now my mother is a sannyasin. My father, who died a few years ago, died a sannyasin, and before his death he told me, \"We were trying to mold you, we were trying to make you. Forgive us. If we had succeeded, we would have destroyed something beautiful.\"\nQ: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THEY FINALLY UNDERSTOOD?\nA: When I came back from the university, then they had to understand it, because their first thing was to get me married -- just the general idea around the world, that if a person is married then his wings are cut, he is chained. Then he\nforgets all about revolutionary ideas, rebellion, those youthful dreams of a better world, better humanity. Just chain him to responsibility. He has a wife who nags him. He has children who are not allowing him to sleep in the night, and he has a job where he never reached in time because of those children and the wife. He forgets all about revolution, a new man.\nSo that was their way. They thought that the first thing after I came back from the university was to force me to get married.\nQ: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED REBELLING?\nA: I must have been four years old when I started rebelling. Q: FOUR?\nA: Four.\nQ: THAT'S YOUNG.\nA: It is, yes, certainly young, but I was strong enough. I was even ready to go and beg on the street, but not to be commanded, and not to be forced to do anything.\nQ: AT FOUR?\nA: Four.\nQ: WAS THERE ANYONE THAT YOU ADMIRED WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP?\nA: Yes... a few people I admired, but very few people. I admired one of my professors, for the simple reason that he had as much respect towards me as I had for him. When I used to enter his room, he would stand up to receive me. I would say, \"This is not right, this is not done.\" He said, \"I don't do it for anybody, but somehow, the moment I see you I cannot remain sitting. It feels embarrassing.\"\nI loved the man. He was a gambler, a drunkard, but a very prominent philosopher. Most of his years he was teaching in America. Only in his old age he had come back home, and that was the time I entered the university. He had just come back from Havana. We fell in love with each other for the simple reason that he had been in rebellion his whole life. His wife, his sons, his daughters were all in New Delhi. He never lived with those people, only on holidays. He made it clear to them that, \"Too much time with you drives me insane, so I will be coming only on holidays.\"\nAnd then he found my ideas... because I was continuously arguing in the class. I was not just a silent listener getting ready for the examination. The examination never meant anything to me. Learning was my purpose. And I said to him that the examination does not matter, what matters is learning, so I have to argue if I see that something is wrong, that something you are saying is illogical -- and on so many points he found himself wrong. But he was a man of tremendous courage. He accepted that he was wrong and I was right.\nSlowly, slowly we became more and more close and intimate, so intimate that one day he took all my luggage from the students' hostel to his own house. He said, \"You don't live outside, you live with me.\" I said, \"It will be a little difficult for you. For me it is just beautiful -- so silent a place, and a beautiful bungalow with a beautiful garden -- but for you it is going to be difficult.\"\nAnd within three days he understood what I meant. After three days he said, \"You were right, because I want to drink, but I cannot drink before you, I feel bad. I want to smoke, but I cannot smoke before you, so in my old age I am hiding in the bathroom and smoking. You have brought my childhood back. When you go to sleep, then I drink. I have to keep my bottles hidden.\" I said, \"I know everything, because when I see cigarettes in the bathroom, and only we two persons are here, it is a simple deduction who is smoking. I am certainly not smoking. And I know that you are drunk; in the morning I see your hangover. So I know where you are hiding your bottles; I have figured it out, because you go to the university every day.\"\nHe was the head of the department of philosophy, and I was a rare visitor. I was a student, but I visited the university very rarely, only to some professors whom I liked. If their period was happening I would go, otherwise I would remain in the house. So I explored the whole house and I found out where he had been hiding the bottles. I said, \"You don't do this. Now it is becoming embarrassing to me. Just for me, you have to smoke hiding, you have to drink like a thief. If you cannot smoke before me, and cannot drink before me, I am leaving.\"\nAnd you will be surprised: he said, \"No, you don't leave. I will stop smoking, I will stop drinking.\" He threw away all the cigarettes, the best that he had brought from Havana. He poured all the wine that he had brought from outside into the gutter, and he said, \"Nobody has been able to convince me. My doctors were against my smoking because my heart is weak, my lungs are weak. My doctors were against drinking because I have diabetes. But I never cared, I told those people, 'I may live two years less, that does not matter, but I will live in freedom.' You never asked me not to smoke. On the contrary, you told me, 'Smoke in front of me. If you feel too embarrassed, I will start smoking with you. If you feel too guilty drinking, I will share.'\"\nI loved that man. Only very few people I have found, but I was never impressed by anybody. I have never followed anybody. I have met remarkable men, but the more remarkable a man was, the more alert I was not to be influenced, because I want to remain myself -- good, bad, famous, notorious, but I want to be just\nmyself And I have retained my individuality, not even a dent on it. I don't like even a dent on my car.\nI was born just as everybody is born -- in families -- but with a rebellious mind. And as far back as I remember -- that is four years old -- I started asserting myself, slowly, and then it became absolute assertion when they asked me to get married. I asked my father, \"Are you satisfied with your marriage? I have seen you being nagged by my mother every day. You cannot even eat your meals peacefully... I have seen you eating your meals, your eyes down, and the mother continuously hammering you, because that is the only time she gets when you are at home, otherwise you are in the shop. Do you want me also to be harassed by another woman? You think it over.\"\nI asked my mother, \"Are you happy that you got married? Are you happy that you have eleven children? Your whole life is wasted -- what have you got out of it? -- not even a single moment of peace. So please, before asking me to marry, think for fifteen days, and then, if you both say so, I will get married. But remember, I am giving you a great responsibility... my whole life.\" And that was really a great challenge for them.\nMy father broke down within three days. He said, \"I take my words back. I will never again ask you to marry. I have suffered much, and I know everybody is suffering.\" My mother took fifteen days -- naturally, women are stronger, can resist anything longer than men -- but after fifteen days she told me, \"You forget about marriage. Our life is enough proof, and we don't want you to get into the same trap. You be yourself.\"\nQ: WELL, BHAGWAN, THEN WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT MARRIED; WE KNOW YOU GET TO EAT YOUR MEALS IN PEACE. HOW DO YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR DAY? DO YOU MEDITATE A LOT? DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY? WHAT DO YOU DO IN A TYPICAL DAY?\nA: I do many things. One, I have always loved my bathroom -- the bathtub, the shower. So, one and a half hours in the morning, one and a half hours in the evening, three hours every day, I devote to my bathroom -- that is my temple.\nQ: WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO IN THE BATHROOM FOR THREE HOURS A DAY? OR SHOULD WE NOT DISCUSS THAT ON VIDEOTAPE?\nA: Just I enjoy sitting under the shower, lying down in my tub. I change from hot, extreme hot, to extreme cold, freezing water. That is immensely healthful to the body. One and a half hours is not long. It goes so fast because I enjoy it so much. So three hours go into the bathroom.\nTwo hours, or two and a half hours in the morning, I talk to my disciples. Then in the night, two hours, just the way I am talking to you, I talk to some journalist, some author. So four or five hours I am talking.\nThen I enjoy my food. I don't like to talk even, because whatever I am doing, I want to do it totally. When I am eating, then I just want to eat and relish every bite to the fullest. So one hour or one and a half hours -- because I take two meals, lunch and supper -- and then I take, before I go to sleep in the night, my whole life I have taken some special sweets which are made only in Bengal, India. So in all, one and a half hours goes to my food.\nTwo hours I sleep in the day. I have napped as long as I can remember, and I love to sleep because to me sleep is just meditation, as pure and as simple and as relaxing. And whatever time remains in the night, I go to bed at about ten or eleven, it depends on the interview. I wake up at six in the morning. I love sleeping on a king size bed -- I love big things! (LAUGHTER)\nQ: WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN? WHAT DO YOU DO FOR RECREATION?\nA: I go for a one-hour drive in one of the ninety Rolls Royces.\nQ: IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR TO SELECT ONE OUT OF NINETY, I IMAGINE.…\nA: So, one hour after my sleep in the afternoon -- I wake up at two -- I go for a drive. My people have made a special road for me. Perhaps I am the only man in the whole world who has a special road without any traffic. It is used only for one hour in twenty-four hours. I love driving, I have always loved it.\nThen whatsoever time is left, I am sitting in my chair. I use only one type of chair\n-- this is the type -- I have many chairs of the same type, so wherever I am, I am in the same type of chair. I have designed it myself, and I have not found any other chair more comfortable than it is. Then I simply relax with closed eyes. You can call it meditation. I cannot call it meditation because to me meditation is now my very nature. Not that I am doing anything, I am just sitting with closed eyes, no ideas floating in my mind. Just utter silence.\nMy life is simple in a way, no complexity; in a way a very strict routine, too. Every day at the same time in the morning I wake up, every day at the same time in the morning I talk to my people -- and that's how I go around the clock.\nQ: DO YOU EVER GET BORED OR TIRED OF ROUTINE?\nA: Never. For thirty-two years I have not experienced boredom. And I don't see any hope that in the future I will have to experience boredom, because I am never comparing. The same bath, the same bubbles, the same pine fragrance... but it is the same only if you compare with your yesterdays. I never compare anything with my yesterdays.\nI can eat the same food for years. The sannyasins who cook my food -- they get bored cooking the same thing, they want to change. But if I like something, I simply like it, and I like it every day. The same thing for years creates no boredom in me because there is no comparison. It is always fresh, and I am always excited.\nYou can ask Vivek, she is here. She brings my food, she takes care of my clothes, my bed, my whole routine, that it goes exactly right. She asks again and again, \"We can change to some other sweet.…\" I say, \"Wait. If I feel bored sometime, I will tell you.\" But I never feel bored. If sometimes I change anything in my food, it is for her sake, because she is getting so bored. And I am eating -- she is simply bringing the plate. She is getting bored carrying the plate, it is human -- so change it.\nQ: HOW IS YOUR HEALTH? YOU SEEM TO BE LOOKING VERY WELL.\nA: My health is very good and getting better. Oregon, its dry climate, its hostile people, all have been tremendously helpful. I am feeling very good.\nQ: WELL, THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I REALLY HAVE -- UNLESS THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD. IS THERE A MESSAGE, ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY?\nA: I would like to say that Oregon is so beautiful that the people who live in Oregon should not behave in ugly ways. It is an insult to this beautiful land. If you have such a beautiful land, it needs and deserves beautiful people, too. So tell the people that I would like them all to come and visit this place, and see that there is a different way of living, too, without hostility, without antagonism, without hatred, without crime. In four years' time, no crime has happened in this commune, no woman has been raped, nobody has been murdered, nobody has committed suicide.\nPeople are so happy and relaxed and rejoicing, who wants to die? And who wants to waste time quarreling, fighting, killing? Who wants to steal? Their very blissfulness prevents them from everything the world is full of.\nMy people work hard, but they call it worship. It is worship. Working on the farm, digging the earth, if you are sensitive enough you will feel it as worship. And if you feel it as worship, you will not get tired. They work ten hours, twelve hours, whatever is the need -- it is their responsibility -- and still nobody is complaining. Nobody is saying that this is too much.\nAnd these are not average, common people. There are Ph.D.s, D.Litt.s, almost everybody is highly educated. Doctors are there, professors are there, engineers are there, architects are there, legal experts are there. Perhaps we have the biggest legal firm in the world: four hundred sannyasins are legal experts. Everybody is doing, but nobody is being coerced to do anything.\nSo tell the Oregonians: I love this land and I am not going to leave this place.\nQ: KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HUMAN NATURE, CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND HOW SOME OREGONIANS MIGHT FEEL THREATENED BY YOUR PRESENCE HERE?\nA: They are all -- not some -- almost ALL are threatened.\nQ: IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED, WOULD YOU PERHAPS NOT FEEL THREATENED IF OREGON WERE YOURS AND A SMALL UNKNOWN GROUP CAME IN, WOULD YOU NOT MAYBE FEEL THREATENED?\nA: No. We don't feel threatened even when we are a small group. So it is unimaginable that we own the whole Oregon and a small group is there, and we feel threatened. We will enjoy that group, we will absorb that group. We will not leave it alone, we will not be hostile to it. They will be our guests.\nAnd it is beautiful to have different kinds of people, strangers. It gives richness. It is simply ugly that the same type of people, the same churches, the same Bible... it makes life dull. I would like any small group, there is no question of being threatened. One feels threatened because one feels one is not happy where he is, what he is, and these people are happy. Their dance is threatening. Otherwise, such a small commune... what is the fear?\nBut just a few days ago, a secret document has been discovered and it has been on television. The governor and all the big officials, the secretary of state, the attorney general, the head of the police and all the government agencies had a secret meeting. And the governor lied. Because they did not allow any journalists in.…\nThis is ugly: in a democracy why should they try to hide things from people? They did not allow any journalists, and the governor said, \"I will have a press conference after the meeting\" -- and he lied in the meeting. Everything he said was a lie.\nNow that secret document has been found. He had the idea that it had been destroyed -- perhaps he had ordered it to be burned, but somehow it was not burned and somebody discovered it. The document says that in that secret meeting they decided that the army should be put on alert, against us; that the military should be ready. At any notice, within three hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram.\nSo it is not a few Oregonians who are threatened.… I am simply amused at the foolishness of this man, Governor Atiyeh. We are not a nation, we don't have an army. You can simply throw a few bombs on the commune and finish it. Just one airplane bringing half a dozen bombs -- small, old fashioned bombs -- and that will do. You don't need an atom bomb. It is not Hiroshima -- Hiroshima was big -\n- it is not Nagasaki. And there is no need to waste so much money. You can bring just any old-fashioned, out-of-date bombs and just finish us.\nBut remember, while your bombs will be falling on us, we will be dancing and singing. We will celebrate it. We celebrate everything. We are celebrants.\nQ: HOW OLD ARE YOU?\nA: I am ancient.\nQ: COULD YOU BE A BIT MORE SPECIFIC?\nA: Very ancient. You can see in me, in my eyes... you will see the whole past of humanity. I am as old as existence itself -- because I have always been here. I am part, just as you are part, of this existence. And I have been in so many bodies that now I cannot get identified with any body. When you have to change so many trains, you are bound to feel that no train is yours; at the coming junction again you have to change the train.\nIn this body I have been fifty-four years. But in fifty-four years I have lived a life which is not possible to live even in two hundred years. I have lived intensely, totally. Whatever I have been doing at whatever time, I was doing it with my whole heart, as if the next moment is death.\nQ: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH? THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. YOU WILL COME BACK IN ANOTHER BODY?\nA: No.… No more. This time is the last time. I have been coming into bodies again and again, but this time it is the last time. After enlightenment, you cannot come back to the body. That is the only disadvantage.\nQ: WHEN DID YOU BECOME ENLIGHTENED? HOW OLD WERE YOU? WAS IT THIS LIFE FOR YOU?\nA: Yes. When I was twenty-one years old.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT OTHERS? WHAT ABOUT THE SANNYASINS: WHEN THEY DIE, WHEN THEY LEAVE THIS LIFE, WILL THEY COME BACK AS HUMANS?\nA: A few will not come. A few are bound to come. It all depends on them. If they die unenlightened, they will have to come back. This is an existential condition, that existence sends you back again and again and again unless you have passed the examination. Enlightenment is the examination. Then there is no question of coming back to the university -- you have learned everything, experienced\neverything. Your being dissolves into the whole, becomes one with it. It is tremendous freedom. Being caged in a body is really carrying your jail around you wherever you go. But as far as I am concerned, this is the last time, so I am trying to make the most of it.\nQ: SO THEN, IS THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED, SO THAT WHEN YOU DO LEAVE THIS LIFE YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO CARRY AROUND THE PRISON OF YOUR BODY?\nA: Right.\nQ: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.\nA: Good. Come back again.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #9 Chapter title: Your Politicians Are Responsible 26 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 20.]\nSwami Shanti Prabhu THE RAJNEESH TIMES RAJNEESHPURAM, OREGON\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT VIOLENCE IS AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE. WHY IS THE UNITED STATES -- A COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF AS A LAND OF FREEDOM -- SUCH A VIOLENT PLACE? IS THERE A RELATION BETWEEN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA AND ITS SO-CALLED FREEDOM?\nANSWER: Violence in America has deep roots. It is the only continent in the world which is being ruled by foreigners. The native red Indians, to whom this continent belongs, are almost finished; and the people who think they are Americans, none of them are American. They have all come from other countries, invaded the poor country, invaded the poor innocent natives. The roots of violence are there.\nThe people who had come into power over this continent through violence have remained in power through violence. Unless the continent is given back to its people, this violence is going to remain.\nIt is a strange phenomenon that the foreigners who are ruling the country are trying to prevent others from living here. We are not trying to rule the country. We are not invaders. They are trying to call us foreigners just because they came here three or four generations ago. Time makes no difference. They are all foreigners.\nWe not rulers. We have not invaded the country. We have not killed its people. We have not destroyed its people's integrity and spirit. We have purchased the land and we have purchased it for the right price. Do you know how much the invaders paid the red Indians for the whole of New York City? -- thirty dollars. The whole of New York was purchased for thirty dollars. This is not purchasing, this is cheating innocent people.\nThe people who came in the early days of America were really criminals. They were thrown out of their countries, expelled. Those criminals became presidents, became chief justices of the Supreme Court. They were expelled from their own\ncountries for crimes which were so big that the countries could not tolerate them. They would either kill them or throw them out.\nThen people from Africa were forced, bribed, persuaded and given great promises, hopes that they were going to a rich world where they would receive all the facilities. What they found here was that they were sold in the marketplace just like cattle. Slavery had disappeared from the whole world, and it appeared just three centuries ago in America. And the slaves, although no longer called slaves, still are not first-class citizens.\nThis continent is based on violence. It has repressed the red Indians in such ugly ways... it is difficult to imagine what man can do to man. Red Indians are living almost in concentration camps. Of course, they are not called concentration camps. They are called reservations, especially reserved for red Indians.\nWhy should red Indians not be allowed to mix in society? It is their land. They have lived here for thousands of years, but now they are confined to forests and mountains, on reservations, and they are being given pensions. On the surface it look humanitarian, as if we are ruling over their continent and we are paying them. For generations we have been paying them but to pay them salaries for no work is not humanitarian.\nWhat will they do with that money? They will get drunk; they will take drugs. They will gamble; they will fight, kill each other. What else do they have to do? Money comes without any effort. They will go on creating more and more children because with each child comes more money. To give people money without work is to reduce them into drunkards, gamblers, murderers. You have taken their dignity.\nOn the surface everything looks so whitewashed, clean. It can be claimed that you are giving them money because you are using their land. But the real purpose is to keep them drunk, fighting, gambling, rowdy, and to keep them in such a state that they never again think of being free, that they never think of getting rid of all the invaders of this continent.\nThe whole society is interwoven with violence. The black people are downtrodden. There are thousands of people on the streets with no home. What do you expect them to do? They will do every kind of crime, they have nothing to lose. And America goes on pretending to the whole world, that wherever there is any trouble, we are going to help. You can't help your own people. Twenty-five percent of Americans who are able to work are unemployed, and America goes to help Ethiopia!\nIn America, Ethiopia is spread everywhere -- just thinly, but it is there -- and violence will come out. These people who have lost everything, respect, humanity, integrity, they have been treated like animals. You cannot expect the country to live without violence.\nBasically, America is one of the greatest destructive powers in the world. The whole government is working with only one object, to win the third world war. But they are simply fools, because nobody can win the third world war, neither\nthe Soviet Union nor America. The difference may be at the most ten minutes. Whoever attacks first, it will take only ten minutes for the other party to attack back. Nuclear weapons are ready on both sides, so it is not a question of somebody getting defeated and somebody else becoming victorious. It is simply suicidal. Both will be destroyed, and with them all life on earth will be destroyed. If your great leaders, political, religious and others, are bent upon having a third world war, if all your scientific and military efforts are just aimed at one point -- how to destroy the Soviet Union and how to destroy communism in the world -- who are you to take responsibility for the whole world? Who are you to decide that the Soviet Union should not be communist? It is none of your business.\nYour government is utterly violent. The whole structure of society is violent. There are the superrich and there are the super-poor in this country. The distance between the rich and the poor is too big. Naturally, the poor man becomes violent -- he is angry. Your priests and bishops go on teaching the poor to be contented, but how long do you think you can keep them contented?\nNow old strategies won't work. You have used this strategy for thousands of years in the whole world, but it is not going to work in America. It is a new country. It has only three hundred years' civilization, which is nothing compared to countries like China or India with histories of thousands of years.\nThis country is new and its poor have seen clearly that they have been exploited. In India they have never seen it clearly -- they have been exploited for thousands of years. They don't remember any time when there was not poverty. They have accepted poverty as the law of nature, the will of God.\nBut you cannot deceive the American poor. He has seen with his own eyes that those who were cunning and clever have exploited him and become rich. He has seen people who were criminals becoming rich; and he has seen simple, innocent people who were not criminals becoming poor. You cannot deceive the American poor. You cannot tell him that he is suffering from his past lives' actions, because he knows perfectly well that he is suffering from other Americans and their actions.\nIn such a small period of history -- three hundred years -- things are very crystal clear. They had all come to America. They were all equal. Nobody was rich, nobody was poor. Then, suddenly, a few people started becoming richer and richer and richer, the richest in the world, and a few people started falling down. They have seen with their own eyes how one becomes rich. It is not by right means. It is by exploiting, by cunning, by every kind of means -- good or bad does not matter.\nThe American poor have a very different attitude from the poor in any other country, because all those countries are very ancient. They don't remember their beginnings; they don't know what happened in the beginning so that a few people became poor and a few people became rich. They think it has always been so. But the American poor have a unique situation. They know what has happened. They cannot forgive it. They cannot forget it. That brings violence.\nViolence is the religion of America. And America is despised and condemned all over the world -- even those countries receiving American help are not sympathetic towards America. I know it. In India you will not find a single person who is sympathetic towards America. And America has been helping: whenever there is a famine or floods or no rain for years, and people are dying, America is always ready to help. But American help does not create sympathy for America. On the contrary, it offends, because they know what you are doing to your own poor.\nWhy are you helping others when you yourself are not doing anything for your own downtrodden? It is not compassion that you go on helping Ethiopia, India, wherever there is poverty and sickness. It is an effort to make ground for your armies, for your nuclear weapons. All those countries understand perfectly that this is simply business, not help.\nAmerica is the most condemned country in the whole world. America has no friends anywhere, for the simple reason that it is the most destructive power today. When your whole government and the energy of the people and the intelligence of your scientists are moving in only one direction -- destruction -- how can you avoid violence?\nThere is only one way, which is really difficult. Give the country back to its native people. If they want you to remain here, you can remain here, but you will have to remain on reservations. If you don't want to live here, that is far better. Just go back to your own countries.\nSomebody is from England, somebody is from Spain, somebody is from Portugal, somebody is from France, somebody is from Italy, somebody is from Greece. The whole of Europe has to accept the responsibility to take these people back. Give the country to its own people. If they allow you to live here, you live, but you live under their rule, and violence will disappear. I don't think red Indians can even imagine about nuclear war.\nWhen you are in power, and you are the greatest power in the world, you are not going to be human, considerate. So it is not a simple phenomenon, it is very complicated, and the violence has many aspects. In America, more rapes happen than anywhere else. Strange. In a country which is educated, rich, why should there be so many rapes? It is because your priests go on talking stupidities to the people. They go on talking about monogamy, they go on saying that if you are not married any sexual relationship is sin.\nI wonder how a marriage license transforms a sin into a virtue? Just a license, a piece of paper, signed by a judge who may be committing adultery himself. In fact, sometimes I wonder from where this word adultery comes. It looks so simple -- any adult must be capable of it; the moment you are capable of adultery you must be an adult. What other meaning can it have? From where can it come? American women still are not free. Protests go on happening in the name of liberation, but the woman is not free, not equal. The woman is angry, and her anger is turning into a perversion. The American woman is educated enough.\nYou cannot keep her repressed like the women of the East, of Arabia, who are uneducated, not knowing anything about the world. The American woman is educated. If you want her to be a dependent partner in a marriage, she would rather move into lesbianism than become a slave of man. In America there are more lesbians than in any other country, and naturally, when women become lesbians, men start becoming homosexuals.\nThese are all different shapes of violence. Your priests are responsible, your politicians are responsible. Do you know what happened in Vietnam? You forced your young people to fight there without understanding the fact that they are not soldiers as they exist in other countries. They were educated, highly qualified, and you forced them to kill innocent, poor Vietnamese for no reason.\nWho are you to interfere in the whole world? You want to put your nose in everywhere? It is Vietnam's decision whether it wants to be communist or not.\nAnd what happened there? Thirty percent of the American soldiers did not kill anybody. They could see that this American violence was absolutely ugly, uncalled for. They could see that the poor Vietnamese have difficulty to arrange even two meals every day and you are bombing them, destroying their houses, burning their houses.\nMany American soldiers went insane for the simple reason that they could not believe that this was what their country stands for. Many of the American soldiers had to be treated psychologically when they came back home from Vietnam; they were so much disturbed they had to be rehabilitated psychologically. They were not like other countries' soldiers -- uneducated, unaware of what is going on -- who when they come home, come with great pride. The American soldiers came back home with guilt and, you may or may not know, many who were in Vietnam have never moved back into American society. They are hiding in jungles and mountains, in Alaska, living a very primitive life.\nMany of them have been approached by their families and friends to come back home. They said, \"We are finished with home, country, nation, flag, American Constitution, democracy, all that nonsense. Just leave us alone. We would like to live here in complete isolation. At least we will not feel guilty. We will not be forced to do something violent, unnecessarily. Back home, they're going to put us back into the army, prepare us again for the third world war. We are not going.\" There are hundreds of young American men who were professors, doctors, engineers, living in the forest like primitive people, in caves. They don't want to come back to America for the simple reason that this whole society is basically wrong. It is based in violence. Twenty percent of American presidents have been murdered. This is a record! In no other country has this happened. Once in a while a person may be murdered, but not twenty percent of the presidents. And if the president is so much unprotected -- remember, the American president is the most protected man in the world -- if the most protected man in the world\ncan be killed by his own people, who else can be at ease? Even the president is not at ease. Every moment, violence!\nIt is not something superficial. If we want to change the violent structure of America, there are three things to be done. One, the country should be ruled by its native people. It belongs to them. Anybody who wants to remain here should remain here, but he cannot remain here as a ruler. Secondly, America should stop bothering about other countries' poor people. It should help its own poor people. Thirdly, America should stop piling up nuclear weapons. They are pointless, and so costly, so meaningless. You already have enough to destroy the whole world, what more do you want?\nAmerica should declare, \"We drop the whole idea of war. We destroy all our nuclear weapons. We drown all those weapons in the Pacific, in the Atlantic. We're finished with it.\" America should declare, \"We will not have any defense department any more -- it is just pointless.\"\nIf America can do that, its people can be immensely rich, happy. And people who are happy do not do violence. It is out of misery, suffering, anger, that violence comes. When you are comfortable, happy, at home, and all that you need is available to you, you don't want to be violent -- because your being violent will destroy your cozy home, your beautiful surroundings, your love life. Your children, your wife, your parents will be lost. It is the people who have nothing to lose who become violent. And one cannot say to them, \"Don't be violent.\"\nI, personally, cannot say to them, \"Don't be violent.\" On what grounds can I say it? They have been cheated of all that a man needs, and if they are revengeful, it seems logical. America should take care of itself Then unemployment is impossible, everybody can be comfortably rich. You just have to stop piling up nuclear weapons, and you can make this country actually, literally a new world by declaring that you are not going to defend.\nDefense is meaningless. Even with all your nuclear weapons you can be destroyed, so what is the point of having all those nuclear weapons? It is a very strange fact that in the past weapons were significant; now they are not, but idiotic politicians go on following past policies of politics. They don't understand that the whole thing has changed.\nOnly a nation which is not burdened by the past can become the first nation in the world to declare, \"We are no longer a separate entity. We are open and available to the whole world. We declare that we are not enemies to anybody. We declare friendship to be our basic policy, and we are ready to lose everything rather than be violent.\"\nIf these three things can be done, it won't harm America in any way. It would give America prestige, pride. America would gain sympathy from all over the world. America would become the beginning of the new world. Other nations would follow just as they are following America now. They are starting to make nuclear plants, atomic plants; if America stops it, they will stop it too.\nAnd the whole world now has become free. The British Empire has disappeared. Only America has not been capable of freeing the people who are the real owners of this country. Give it back to them. You have reduced them to such a situation that they cannot even struggle for freedom. They are doped, drugged. They are almost asleep. They cannot fight for freedom, they don't know what freedom is. And they don't want it either, because this is going so well: no work, and money is available; no work, and alcohol is available; no work, and all drugs are available. Even those drugs which are prohibited to other people are available to the red Indians, to destroy them, to destroy their spirit.\nI say these three things: the land has to go back to the real owners -- those who are capable of living here under the red Indians as rulers can remain, otherwise they should go back to their own country; America has to stop all interference with other countries, and put its whole energy into changing the conditions of the poor, of the blacks, of the women; and third, it has to drop the very idea of war, to become the first country in the history of the world to drop war, defense departments, armies, to become a precedent -- for others to follow.…\nI am perfectly convinced that if America can do that, soon other countries would have to follow, would certainly follow, because they are also suffering. Under the pressure of war effort, their whole economies are going down and down. But out of fear they cannot stop creating more weapons.\nThese simple things just need a little understanding, and America can open a new dimension for the whole of humanity.\nQ: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID THERE IS NO GOD, ONLY GODLINESS; AND THERE IS NO RELIGION, ONLY RELIGIOUSNESS. IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A MASTER, OR IS IT MASTERLINESS? PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nA: There is no such thing as a Master, but there is certainly something you can call masterliness. Everybody cannot manage -- even all the people who have become enlightened have not been Masters.\nTo be a Master, different qualities are needed than just enlightenment. You can become enlightened and perhaps nobody will ever know about it. To give the message you have got, you need to be articulate, immensely articulate, because you are going to do something which is almost impossible -- you are going to transform the experience of silence, wordlessness, into words.\nYou have to be a charismatic personality so that people are automatically attracted towards you. No need for advertisement: mouth to mouth, people start hearing about you, that something immense has happened to a man... and not only that, the man is capable in some strange way to relate it to you. Through words, through silence, just by his presence, just by looking into your eyes, just holding your hand, something transpires. Something starts happening to you which you have never thought about, never dreamed about.\nYes, there is a certain quality which makes a man a Master. But I say that there is no need of a Master because people in their ignorance, in their unconscious state, start becoming dependent on the Master. He becomes a father figure, and that is where everything goes wrong. He himself unknowingly destroys what he is doing.\nI am here with you, and I say that I am not your Master and you are not my follower -- and you know perfectly well, I know perfectly well, that I am your Master and you are my follower. But I go on insisting that you are not my follower and I am not your Master -- you are my fellow travelers -- just so that you don't become dependent on me, just so that you don't start thinking it is my responsibility; you need not be worried: the Master is there, he will take care, he is the savior. He will save you, you need not do anything.…\nNo, I want you to be responsible. I want you to take all your responsibility on yourself. I can impart whatsoever has happened to me, and it is no obligation to you. I am not obliging you; I am simply enjoying sharing.\nTo have enlightenment is tremendous bliss, but it is nothing compared to sharing it. When one starts seeing the same flame in thousands of eyes, the same luster and glory around thousands of faces, no enlightenment can be compared to it. It transcends all bliss that you have known in enlightenment. That was an individual affair, small; a window had opened and you had looked through the window. The sky, the stars... but the frame of the window was there. Your experience was framed. You have never been out of the house, so naturally you will deduce that this is the sky -- the frame of your window.\nYes, you are seeing real stars and the real sky, but you are confined, limited. Your window is giving a frame to your experience. If you want to share with others, you will have to come out, you will have to seek people with whom you can share. You will have to go and knock on many doors to find people who are almost ready to receive it. And when you go out of the house searching for seekers and disciples, then you know the whole sky, the infinity of it, the unlimited number of stars. Now you know that sky you had seen was framed.\nThere is no frame, there is no boundary to existence. Sharing your enlightenment, you come to know there is no boundary to enlightenment, either. It is not yours or mine, it is existential.\nThis I call transcendence of enlightenment. This is the moment when the enlightened person becomes ordinary: he has transcended even that speciality of being enlightened. Now he is at ease with himself and his ordinariness.\nBut this ordinariness has an immense impact of its own, it has the charisma I am talking about. It makes the man a magnetic force. He becomes the very center of the whole existence, and all those who are in search -- even groping in darkness -\n- start moving towards him. But don't give it a frame. When you call it a Master, you have given it a frame. Let it remain a quality -- masterliness.\nThere is no God, there is godliness. There is no religion, there is religiousness. There is no Master, there is only mastery, masterliness. And as the Master\nbecomes a quality, immediately the disciple becomes a quality. Then there is no disciple, only discipleship.\nDiscipleship is a totally different thing. Disciplehood, or to come to the exact right word, discipline. The word discipline means learning, the process of learning. There is no disciple, no learner, but there is a process of learning.\nThere is no Master who teaches you, but there is a Master -- being who shares that which he has found. And his treasure is infinite, inexhaustible.\nQ: BHAGWAN, IN THE PAST, MONARCHS, STATESMEN AND POLITICIANS ALWAYS LOOKED TOWARD THE WISE ENLIGHTENED MEN FOR THEIR ADVICE IN AFFAIRS OF STATE. WOULD IT BE A BOON TO MANKIND IF RONALD REAGAN SOUGHT YOUR ADVICE? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM?\nA: In the first place, the politicians of today are not so wise as some emperors in the past have been. The emperor was born, so sometimes there were idiots who became emperors, mad, crazy people who became emperors. Once in a while, there was a person who was wise enough and yet became an emperor. Augustus in Rome and Ashoka in India were such emperors. They went to seek advice. They knew there were people who knew much more; they knew there were people whose word is truth.\nBut today's presidents and prime ministers are going to be just third-rate cunning politicians. It is impossible for a wise man to become the president of a country, for the simple reason that he is wise. He cannot lie, he cannot give you promises which he knows can never be fulfilled.\nHe will tell you things which will hurt you. Just think of me: in the first place I cannot run for the presidency of a country, because I don't like running. I can drive in my Rolls Royce, so my campaign for the presidency will not be running for president, but driving for president.\nMy whole life I have been practicing a certain art: how to influence people and create enemies. This is not a way to become a president or a prime minister. No wise man can even think of it, because he cannot fulfill the basic conditions of a politician.\nAnd you are asking me that if a president -- for example, Ronald Reagan -- came here for my advice, would I give it to him? Of course. If I can give advice to you all, why can't I give advice to Ronald Reagan? But he will have to come not as a president, but as a disciple, because unless you come to learn, I cannot teach you. If he comes as a president, he cannot get an appointment from Sheela; but if he comes just as a human being he is welcome. Any politician from any country is welcome, but he should come just as a human being; otherwise it is useless, wasting my time and wasting his time.\nSo from my side, I am clear. But your question is only \"if\" -- you should not forget. No president is going to come. No president has the guts to come. It is my\nwhole life's experience, I am not just saying something without any support from my experience.\nI knew Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, personally. He was a man of great aesthetic, poetic qualities, but still he had not the guts to accept my advice.\nHe said, \"You are right, but you don't know this dirty politics. If I start doing things the way you are suggesting, I will simply lose my premiership. I will not be able to do what you are saying -- I will just lose my power, my prestige. I will look crazy. And I say to you that what you are saying is right.\"\nHis successor, Lalbahadur Shastri, was immensely interested in me. He died with one of my books on his chest. He was reading it and must have fallen asleep, had a heart attack, and died. He was in Tashkent, Russia, for a summit meeting -- the American and Russian presidents, the Pakistani president, and he. These four were there to settle matters about Kashmir, because a part of Kashmir was occupied by Pakistan.\nPakistan's army had been standing ready there for almost forty years. The Indian army was ready -- confronting Pakistan's army for forty years. And the UNO's representative army was just standing in between at the cease-fire line. Now, how long is it going to be there, this cease-fire line? Forty years is too long a time. They had gone to settle it, but Shastri died.\nHe lived just to be the prime minister for one year. He was very simple in a way, and it was by chance that he was chosen prime minister. No one could have thought that he could win the race, but in the political game it sometimes happens. He was the most unexpected candidate.\nThe commanding, ruling party of the country was very much afraid of Morarji Desai because he was the most stubborn type of person. Once he became the prime minister, he would not care a bit about the committee who had chosen him. The committee was afraid to choose him for the simple reason that they knew that man. Once he had power in his hands, he wouldn't care even about those who had given him power.\nSo on the one side was Morarji Desai, on the other side was Indira Gandhi. They were afraid to choose Indira Gandhi because in the whole political atmosphere there was the idea that India is not a democracy, but a monarchy. Jawaharlal was the first prime minister; now his daughter will be the second prime minister. They wanted to avoid Indira, because turning it into a family affair would bring condemnation to all of them and would make the opposite parties more powerful.\nAnd certainly it has turned into a family affair. After Indira, her son became the prime minister. For forty years one family has been ruling, except for that one year when Lalbahadur was chosen.\nHe was chosen because he was a very simple and weak person. The committee knew perfectly well that even if he were the prime minister, they would remain\nthe masters, the kingmakers. He would be only a puppet. Whatever they wanted, he would do.\nMorarji Desai could not be chosen. He wanted to be chosen; he was forcing the committee -- \"I am the most experienced, the most senior person, why are you not choosing me?\" Against him was standing Indira Gandhi. She had her reasons: she had lived with her father, she had seen the whole freedom struggle, its problems. She had seen the beginnings of the independence of India, its complexities, its problems. She knew every in and out of all the politicians of the country. Nobody else had such knowledge.\nShe claimed that Morarji Desai might be senior, but that he knew nothing about all the chief ministers of the states, all the governors. He knew nothing. She had all the files of her father and his whole experience, and she had been living with him. She knew everybody -- who was dependable, who was not, who was reliable, who was not, who was certain to betray the country.\nBoth had their claims, but the committee persuaded Lalbahadur. He was a very small-sized man, and he was very afraid: \"Forgive me, I cannot manage, I am a simple man. \" He had never been in the public eye, he was not a national figure.\nJust because Jawaharlal loved him for his sincerity, truthfulness, reliability, he was in the supreme commanding committee of the ruling party. Jawaharlal had put him there.\nThe committee unanimously chose Lalbahadur. It sometimes happens. He was\nvery available to me, but even he was not courageous enough to come to see me. He managed a lunch, in a political way, in the house of one of his cabinet ministers.\nThis man, Karan Singh, was interested in me -- he was the king of Kashmir, and because Kashmir became dissolved into India, he was immediately taken into the cabinet. Naturally he had to be given something; he was the first to join India and give his whole country to the union. He was very much interested in me, so Lalbahadur said, \"This would be good. You call him and me for lunch, so just casually we meet and discuss. My going to him will be dangerous to my career.\" And he confessed it to me that this is how diplomacy works. Nobody knows -- just a casual, accidental meeting. And before lunch, after lunch, for almost three hours he was listening to me about every problem that he was facing.\nBut I told him it would be good if he came to my place and lived a few days with me. Everything could be cleared. He said, \"That is impossible. If people come to know that I have gone to you for advice, I am finished. You have so many enemies in the country, in my party, in my cabinet, that I cannot take that risk. And I am simply a weak manI have been chosen for my weakness.\" But he was sincere.\nIndira, the third prime minister of India, was very much interested in me, but not courageous enough to come to Poona. She was continuously telling Laxmi, \"I want to see Bhagwan, I want to come. And next time when I come to Bombay or anywhere nearby, I am going to come to the ashram.\nAnd she came twice to Poona itself, but she never could gather courage to come to the ashram. Political fear.… Just to be associated with a man like me needs courage, because all those who are my enemies will become your enemies. And all those who are your friends may stop being your friends just because you are associated with me.\nThe last time she came to Poona, she told Laxmi, \"This time, whatsoever happens I am going to manage and come.\" But when Laxmi went to see her, she said, \"There are so many engagements, I cannot find time.\"\nAnd this was a lie -- because she went to Kohlapur, four hours driving, to meet the shankaracharya, the head of the Hindus, like the pope is the head of the Catholics. She found time to go to the shankaracharya -- four hours going, four hours coming, and just two minutes to touch the feet of the shankaracharya. But that was politically helpful. Thousands of Hindus had gathered for the shankaracharya. He was an old man from the south, very much respected by the Hindus because he was absolutely fulfilling all their demands of how a religious person should be. He was an ascetic, a masochist -- those were the qualities that Hindus were asking. Intelligence has never been asked. Scholarship, yes -- he could recite Hindu scriptures without reading; he knew them by rote. He was very much respected and he was very old, eighty or eighty-five.\nNow Indira lied that she had no time; but the reality is that she had no courage -- even to meet the person who was the only one who supported her when she was defeated and lost her premiership. The whole country was against her, it was a tremendous defeat, and when she stood in a by-election, I was the only man to bless her. No shankaracharya blessed her, not even Vinoba Bhave, who was her political guru, blessed her. Now they were afraid that to bless her means to lose many friends.\nShe went to the shankaracharya again to get his blessings. He did not speak a word. She was told that he had taken silence for the day. This was simple diplomacy: if he has taken silence, good; when she touches his feet he can bless her with the hand -- that is not breaking your silence. But no, he remained sitting just like a statue -- because it was a problem for him too. If he blessed Indira, then all the Hindus who were against Indira would be against him. It is a simple rule. The enemy of your enemy is your friend.\nSo I would like to say to you that your question is only if. Ronald Reagan cannot come, cannot have the courage. But from my side I have no ifs, no buts. If he wants to come, he is welcome; but he has to remember that here he is not the president, that he has come here to seek advice, to learn something. He has to be here like a disciple. If that much humbleness is there, then certainly my advice can reach to his heart. Otherwise, it is meaningless.\nOkay?\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1\nChapter #10 Chapter title: My Work Has Just Begun 27 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 21.]\nMa Anand Rose\nDIE RAJNEESH TIMES COLOGNE,\nWEST GERMANY\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, NO COUNTRY, NOT EVEN AMERICA, IS AS UPSET AS THE GERMANS AT YOUR PRESENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY, AND AT YOUR INFLUENCE ON INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE PEOPLE. THEY ARE TRYING HARD TO SEE YOU AS ANOTHER HITLER. WHAT DOES THAT TELL ABOUT THE GERMAN MIND, FORTY YEARS AFTER HITLER'S DEATH?\nAnswer: The ghost of Adolf Hitler, his long shadow, is still present. And Adolf Hitler is not something that you can confine to one person. It is something deep down in the German mind itself. Adolf Hitler would not have existed if the German mind had not been supportive of him. And not only ordinary people -- who can be easily influenced, impressed -- but many exceptional people: geniuses like Heidegger, who is certainly the most important philosopher of the twentieth century, he was a follower of Adolf Hitler.\nWhat these people were seeing in Adolf Hitler was something that was in themselves. In Adolf Hitler it was magnified. In themselves they could not see it, but Adolf Hitler became the mirror; they could see it, and he became the representative of the collective unconscious mind of Germany. Hence, the influence that he had.\nAlthough forty years have passed, the German mind is still the same. And when they see my influence on people they become afraid, for the simple reason that if I can influence so many young intelligent German people, I can paint the whole of Germany red. And Germany has suffered through Adolf Hitler's influence so much, the wound is still there and it hurts. They don't know much about me. All they know is that thousands of young Germans are ready to die for me. To their knowledge, this phenomenon had happened only with Adolf Hitler. In the same way, thousands and thousands of people were ready to die for him, to do anything for him. So they see a certain similarity. But there is no similarity at all. I teach people to live for me, not to die for me. I teach people to dance for me, not to die for me. All your so-called great leaders of the world have told their people that they should be ready to die for them. That was thought to be something of\ngreat pride. And certainly millions have died for idiots. They died, they killed, all kinds of neurosis was released by these so-called leaders.\nI am not a leader. I am not a politician. I insist to my people to live long, to live happily, to rejoice. Even if I die, celebrate it. Nobody has ever said to his people, \"When I die you rejoice and celebrate, sing and dance.\" In thousands of years not a single man has been there to say this. They were just saying, \"Be ready. If you love me, be ready to die for me, because we are going to conquer lands, conquer the whole world. If you are not ready to die for me, you are a coward, and then how are you going to conquer the world?\"\nI have a different way of conquering the world. I don't need nuclear weapons, atom bombs. I have a different approach totally. And they have all failed. None of them could conquer the whole world, neither Alexander the Great, nor Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mussolini, nor Mao Tse-tung. They all have, without exception, failed, because this is not the way to conquer. Hate is not the way to conquer. It will destroy the other, and in consequence it will destroy you too. Your victory is going to be just a very passing phase.\nI say to my people: Yes, we are going to take over the world -- by our rejoicing, by our love, by our peace, serenity, by our meditation. We are not politicians. We are not going to rule them. In fact, we are going to teach everybody not to be ruled by anyone and not to rule anyone. Only then are you really an authentic human being.\nMy influence on German people is exactly the opposite of Adolf Hitler's. But influence is there, and those who don't know me can find a certain similarity. Those who know will find that the influence is there, in fact it is far greater than Adolf Hitler's.\nAnd it is not me who is saying it. One of the most important Western journalists, author of many significant books, Aubrey Menen, wrote a book almost ten years ago about the new mystics. He put my picture on the cover. The book was published by Thames and Hudson in London. What he said inside, even I could not believe. He said, \"I have seen Adolf Hitler, interviewed Adolf Hitler, I have listened to Adolf Hitler in a meeting sitting in the front row, and I have seen his tremendous influence on people, but it is nothing compared to Bhagwan.\" His influence, he says, was only that of oratory, there was no substance in it. Those people were enchanted because their egos were fulfilled. He was saying to those people that you are the highest race amongst human beings. You are the purest Nordic Aryans. It is your birthright to rule all over the world.\nNaturally, all those who had ambitions, ego trips, were influenced. Here is a man who can manage to fulfill their hidden desire. They themselves, of course, cannot manage, it is too big. Aubrey Menen says that people were influenced, but that influence was something sick. It was fulfilling their egos.\nThe people who are influenced by me are totally different. I am making every effort to destroy your ego. And to destroy the German ego is the hardest thing!\nIn fact the intelligent, German, young generation is influenced by me against Adolf Hitler and against any possibility of Adolf Hitler ever happening again in Germany. I am the greatest enemy of Adolf Hitler's anywhere. And any country which is influenced by me, particularly the young generation -- I don't care about the graveyards, I only trust the young blood, fresh blood -- if they are in love with me, that means Adolf Hitler is impossible, destruction is impossible. And it is true about other countries too.\nIf all over the world the intelligent young people become attuned with me, fall in love with me, not only Adolf Hitler but even the third world war is impossible. To create a third world war you will need all kinds of geniuses, talented people, young. And if they have in some way fallen in love with me, they are not going to serve any destructive cause at any price. They are going to simply refuse.\nMy influence is diametrically opposite to Adolf Hitler. The older generation may be afraid. They have seen Adolf Hitler, they have seen his great influence, they have seen people becoming almost mad after him. And he himself was a retarded mind. He himself was not intelligent at all, just a third-rate person. He was refused admission to schools, colleges. He was refused admission to the university -- he wanted to learn architecture. Then, seeing everywhere rejection -- nobody could think him capable of anything great -- he joined the army.\nThat was the last resort of all the idiots, of all the fools, of all the stupid minds. The army is the last resort: you don't need intelligence. In fact, intelligence is a barrier in becoming a good soldier. Just as a retarded person cannot become a sannyasin, an intelligent person cannot become a soldier. What does it mean to become a soldier? It means you have accepted death as your profession. You don't have any sensitivity for what you are doing. For a little salary and employment you have accepted to murder innocent people, children, women, old people who have done no harm to you, to whom you are not even introduced.\nThis needs something of a very low kind of person, almost the animal. Physically he looks like a human being, mentally he is not. And these people have fought all the wars. Of course, when you want to kill people you have to be ready to be killed any moment. They have not only sold their intelligence and their freedom into the hands of some dictator, for just a little employment they have become murderers. And simultaneously they have accepted for that little salary to be suicidal also, because in war it is not necessarily so that you will only kill and you will not be killed.\nSo those leaders were emphasizing, \"Be ready to kill or be killed. The stake is great: the nation's pride, the race and its ego, the religion and its messiah.\" All these people have been teaching you just death, either somebody else's or your own.\nI am simply amazed when people start comparing me with people who are absolutely opposite to me. In anything, my influence is to live more, to allow others to live more, to love more, to allow others to love more. Let this whole\nearth become a celebrating planet. There is no reason to kill and be killed, and just for some fool like Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin. If they want, they can commit suicide, they can hang themselves from any tree, but why spread this poison? They spread this poison because it fulfills their ego. The name of the nation, race, religion is just a facade, just a curtain, a mask. Behind it is some monster who looks like a human being. My message is for love, life, laughter.\nBut not only in Germany, everywhere there is fear, because it has always happened that whenever there was a man of charismatic influence who can attract people so much that they become identified with him, there has always been difficulty. That's why, because of their past experience, they are afraid. All over the world there is great fear. And the strange thing is, their fear is absolutely baseless.\nI am a totally new kind of man, the beginning of a new humanity. But I can understand them. They have only their past, and their past is long, and their experience is wrong. And whenever there has been a man of influence, he has created trouble. Adolf Hitler created the second world war. Now they are afraid; if their younger generation is being influenced by me and is ready to do anything that I say, naturally fear arises. Again the same situation may happen. But just tell them, with me it cannot happen. Without me it can happen.\nThey are so afraid in Germany that perhaps sometime I may be coming to visit my communes, they have already put a bogus law case against me. Just in case I want to enter the country I can be immediately arrested. I have never been in Germany and I have never done anything in Germany. But they can file a case against me.\nThat case will help them in many ways. First, they can refuse my entry. Secondly, they can allow me to enter but refuse to let me out of the country. Thirdly, as long as the case is not finished, they can force me to remain there. And they can put other cases. If I win in one case, they can put another. There is no problem in it. Somebody simply goes to the court and says that what Bhagwan has said hurts my religious feeling. That is enough.\nIt is a very strange world in which we are living. If your religious feeling is hurt, then it is your problem; get treated, or drop that religion which cannot help you to be strong enough not to be hurt by a small criticism from anybody. And if your heart, your religious feelings are disturbed, that simply shows they are superficial. You need a new religion which goes deep to your roots and nobody can hurt you. Can any of my people be hurt? None of my people have gone to the courts, filing cases, and had their religious feelings hurt.\nI have been condemned all over the world, in all the newspapers, in all the media. They have called me all kinds of names. You could have easily gone to court. In every country you could have fought that your religious feeling is hurt, but none of my people has even thought about it. They simply laughed and ignored it. Filing a lawsuit means giving attention to idiots. And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying without any argument. They have no argument.\nIn India once there was a case against me -- of a similar type -- that I have hurt the religious feelings of Hindus. That is enough in any country. This is very strange. And why was the case accepted by the court? It went for almost one year and I had to come back to Ahmedabad again and again for that case. They were simply wasting my time, and the case was utterly stupid.\nSpeaking in Ahmedabad, amongst fifty thousand people, I had said that Mahatma Gandhi used to listen to the story of Rama every day. Vinoba Bhave, one of his disciples, but a very scholarly person, used to read the Ramayana, the story of Rama. It is read in every house in India. The drama of Rama is played in every town, city, village, every year. Rama is in every Hindu heart's center.\nI said in the meeting that Vinoba was reading the story of Rama, and there comes a passage where Rama's wife, Sita, is stolen. Just to leave some clues as to what direction she has been taken, she went on throwing her ornaments on the way. Indian women have many ornaments, and she was a queen, so she had enough ornaments. And it was bound -- she felt it was certainly logical -- that Rama would find these ornaments and they would give him a clue to the direction, and if he found more, that made it more certain. If he found more he could reach to where she was being taken.\nAnd he found -- precious diamonds, emeralds, rubies.… He asked his brother Laxmana, \"Do you recognize? Are these ornaments my wife's? I cannot recognize them myself because whenever I am with Sita, she is so beautiful that I get lost into her. I don't pay attention to her ornaments, so I cannot be certain that this ornament belongs to her. But in this thick forest, who is going to throw rubies and diamonds and ornaments made of all kinds of precious stones? Laxmana, perhaps you can find.\" Laxmana said, \"Please forgive me, because I have never seen Sita, except her feet, because I used to touch her feet every morning.\" Your elder brother's wife in India is thought to be equal to your mother. \"And I have never seen her face, I have never seen above her feet. Yes, if we come across the ornaments she used on her feet, I will recognize them immediately.\"\nGandhi was a little puzzled. He said to Vinoba, \"I don't understand. First, I cannot understand Rama, that he lived for so many years and he could not recognize the ornaments of his own wife. But perhaps he was still on his honeymoon. Sita may have been very enchanting -- but why Laxmana never saw Sita?\" Vinoba produced an argument -- which is not in the story, the argument is Vinoba's -- he produced an argument that Laxmana never saw Sita's face because he wanted to remain celibate. He wanted to remain unimpressed by Sita's beauty because he was under a strict discipline. And Gandhi accepted the idea that it was because of a strict discipline; that Sita was so beautiful, perhaps looking at her he may get passionately interested in her.\nGandhi accepted the idea. Not only that, it was because of this argument he gave Vinoba the title of Acharya. Acharya means the master mind. He said, \"The explanation that you have given makes you a master. I could not have conceived that this would be the explanation.\"\nI told this whole thing to the people, fifty thousand people -- and they were all Hindus, followers of Rama, followers of Gandhi, followers of Vinoba -- and I told them that Laxmana's explanation is ugly. It simply shows that he was afraid to see the face. This fear is already part of desire and passion. He was perfectly aware that if he saw her, he would like to have her. All this must have been going on in his mind. He must have been dreaming of Sita, because it was not that he had never seen her. Before the marriage, Laxmana and Rama both had gone to see her.\nIn those days in India, the king's daughters used to have a certain ceremony. It was called swayamvara. The princess chooses her husband by a certain device. Sita was the daughter of a very big emperor. Hundreds of kings had come to marry her. The device was that Sita's father had one very long bow, which was known as \"Shiva's bow.\" And the condition was that anybody who could just by hand break the bow into pieces, he would be the person to marry Sita.\nThe bow was so heavy that many kings tried to take it up from the platform, but they fell themselves. They could not move the bow. There was no question of breaking it just by hand. Sita was sitting there ready with the garment. Whoever breaks the bow.… And Laxmana was getting very eager. They had gone with their teacher, Vashishtha. The father of Rama had sent Vashishtha to take care of the boys and see that they were not defeated, that no cunningness was being used. Laxmana was getting so excited that he was asking again and again, \"Vashishtha, just give me permission and I will break it.\" Vashishtha said, \"You just keep quiet. Rama has the first right, he is your elder brother. If he fails, then you have a chance.\"\nOf course Rama broke the bow. Laxmana had seen Sita, seen the beauty of the woman. She must have been a rare woman. Now he had to treat her as if she were his mother. You can imagine his mind.\nI explained to those people that Vinoba's explanation simply shows Vinoba's mind. It has nothing to do with Laxmana. Vinoba was a celibate, and he knew perfectly what celibacy means. Your dreams are full of girls, your whole day is continuously a fantasy of sexuality. The repressed sex tries in every possible way to break your unnatural idea of celibacy. Vinoba was afraid of meeting women, seeing women. He used to live isolated. He never lived in Gandhi's ashram itself, because there were women there. He lived a few miles away. He used to come every day at the prayer time, reading the story of Rama or some other scripture, and would go back. But he lived in isolation. Around Gandhi's ashram was dangerous: there were women, beautiful women, and he was a celibate monk.\nThe explanation that he gave was his own mind, and the explanation is a condemnation of Laxmana. It makes him a repressed sexual person. It is a condemnation, it is not appreciation. Neither Vinoba understands the psychology, nor Gandhi understands the psychology, because he confers the degree of Acharya for this stupid explanation!\nA case was filed against me, that somebody's religious feelings were hurt. I said to the court, \"This is strange. I have not said a single word against Laxmana. I was criticizing Vinoba's explanation.\" Vinoba was alive then. I told the court, \"You call Vinoba, and I am ready to argue with him that his explanation is wrong\n-- not only wrong, but condemnatory.\n\"And from where does this man get the idea that his Hindu feelings are hurt? Vinoba is not yet a Hindu incarnation of God, and I am trying to save Laxmana, that this is not the right explanation. In any Sigmund Freud's hands this explanation will mean Laxmana is sexually so much repressed, so much afraid of his own repression that he cannot look at the face of the woman.\"\nThe court finally agreed with me, but the court was also Hindu, so they were not daring enough to call Vinoba also into the court. I said, \"This is unfair. I criticized him, this man says I have hurt his feelings. Now the court gives the judgment that I am not speaking against Hinduism, I have spoken against the explanation. Now it is the duty of the court to call Vinoba. Vinoba has hurt the Hindu mind and the Hindu mind's religious feeling.\"\nBut Vinoba was a great Hindu leader, so naturally he was never called. The case was really against him, not against me. But one strange thing happened. Whenever the case was in the court, thousands of people would be there, inside the court, outside on the verandas, on the lawn -- thousands of people, at least ten thousand people would come to listen to what I was saying. And they were all Hindus. And when I won the case, the man who had filed the case against me told the magistrate that he needed police protection. I said, \"For what? I need police protection because I have hurt the feelings of the Hindu religion, religious people, and these ten thousand people are Hindus. And I have to go out of this room -- these ten thousand people can kill me. And this fellow is asking police support and police protection -- for what? Are these Hindus against him?\"\nThey were. They could see the point clearly, they could see that this man is simply a Hindu chauvinist. They could see that I had been unnecessarily harassed for the whole year. And they were really angry, they were shouting and screaming and asking that the man should be delivered to them, so they could teach him what it means to be \"religiously hurt.\"\nThe magistrate himself was afraid that the situation was dangerous. He told the man to go inside, behind, which was the magistrate's private room, and just remain there until everybody was gone. \"No police protection will help, because these ten thousand people. From where can I bring the whole army to prevent\nthese ten thousand people? The court has a few policemen, but they are not enough to protect you. You just sit.\" And he went inside the room and waited. I left, so naturally other people left by and by. Perhaps he must have left just when the court was being closed, or he must have left with the magistrate in his own car.\nExactly that type of case they have put in Germany. And soon they will be putting it in every country. Because I told the Australian media, \"Get ready, I am\ncoming,\" now the whole of Australia is agog, afraid. Newspapers have started coming, saying that people are very much disturbed, afraid that I may remain there, may not leave Australia. But the man himself who was here was an intelligent man. I really loved the man, he was not just a journalist.\nHe is answering the phone calls continuously coming to his studio. He informed us, \"I have never answered myself, my secretary answers, but this time I am answering myself because I can say to them that I have been there, I have seen the man, I have seen the commune that is there, and they are beautiful people, and you need not be afraid. And don't get unnecessarily excited by rumors. There is no danger.\" But it is now all over Australia, a great wave of fear. I have not gone there and there is not much possibility.\nBut my people are there, and my people are growing in every country. And in every country my people will have to face the same problems. They cannot believe, the politicians and others, that I am not going to use my influence politically. It is something inconceivable to those retarded people, that there can be a man who has great influence and is not going to use it in any way.\nMy influence is that of love. I love my people, and I would not like to put my people in any kind of destructive situation.\nBut what can you do with people who are so afraid that they cannot even come to visit the commune to see and experience themselves that there is nothing to fear? My people are peaceful and wherever they will go they will bring the peace, the silence, the rejoicing. They will bring songs to every country and ecstasy to every land.\nOur war is totally different. They don't understand. We are spreading a certain kind of atmosphere around the world which can prevent wars, which can prevent Adolf Hitlers, which can prevent nuclear weapons being used.\nQ: BHAGWAN, IN YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD BEING ONE COMMUNE, IS IT STILL SO THAT THE ITALIANS SHOULD BE THE COOKS, THE FRENCH THE LOVERS AND THE GERMANS THE ORGANIZERS?\nA: Most probably, because who can cook better than the Italians? And in my commune everybody is to do the best he can. Yes, the Germans will be the organizers. They have proved -- and I have a greater number of Germans than from any other country -- they are the best organizers, the most reliable people. You can trust them, they can never betray. They certainly have a very strong spirit.\nBut nobody is going to force them. If they want to change places they can change, and that is how it is happening in my communes all over the world. People don't remain stuck to one job, they want to learn many more things. The doctor wants to learn plumbing, the plumber wants to be a mechanic, the mechanic wants to be a cook. The commune is also a university. It is so many things together. It is a religion, it is a university, it is the birth place for the new man.\nSo my feeling is that Italians will try to learn how to organize, although in the beginning their organization will be greasy, lousy, spaghetti all over. Nobody is going to condemn them, that's natural. The Germans cooking, you can understand, Koran Grove will be full. If we can survive German cooking, that means a miracle has happened, but we will try. We are open to all possibilities.\nAnd it is already happening that way. In fact the moment you enter a commune nobody recognizes you as Italian, as German, as Indian, as American. All those things simply disappear; you are just my people -- the red people. A new identity comes up and throws out all old identifications.\nI don't know who is a German, who is an Italian, who is Greek, who is Spanish. I don't know myself, except for a few people who had come to me in the very beginning, so I know them more personally. That's why when I want to say something about Germans I will use Haridas, because except Haridas I don't know any German. If I have to talk about the English, I have to talk about Teertha because I don't know anybody else. If I have to talk about Italians, then Asheesh is the only Italian.\nBut there are many and now there is no possibility for me to be acquainted the way I am with Teertha or Haridas or Asheesh. That way is not possible any more. I will love you but I will not know your name. I will do everything for you but I will not know your name, your race, your country. And the thing has become so enormous and big, and it is expanding with such speed, you cannot expect me to. In the beginning, when there were only a few people who could be counted on fingers, naturally I knew their name, their country, their background and they had the chance of being more intimate. In the beginning it was possible. But don't feel that those who have come late are deprived of anything, because my work has really begun now. After I started speaking again, those three years that I remained silent were just to give a gap. All that I had done before that was only a preparation; then a three years' gap so that all those who want to escape can escape before my real work starts.\nSo those who have come just now, they should not feel deprived. My work has begun just now. Now I am talking directly to you. There is no Krishna between me and you and no Jesus between me and you. I am cutting their heads right and left and creating a direct passage. I am not allowing even people whom I love -- Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu -- I am not going to let anyone stand between me and you. I am going to chop their heads. Of course, lovingly. I can ask them, \"Forgive me, but I have to chop your head because now nobody stands between me and my people.\"\nHowever beautiful is Heraclitus, and however much I have loved Pythagoras and Zarathustra, it does not matter. That is my personal affair. As far as you are concerned I am not going to let anybody else stand between me and you. So nobody needs to feel that he has missed something -- no!\nMy work has begun just now and you have all come in the right moment. Those who have remained in the preparatory period, in the silent period, of course, are\nmore fortunate. But if you have courage enough you can take a long jump and be in the front line with the old sannyasins. It only needs courage. They had enough time to go slowly, step by step. The new sannyasins will have to jump four steps at a time. Soon you will be all in the same line. And that's my effort, that's why I am giving you so many shocks. Shocks are particularly good to keep people jumping. I don't let them stand in one place. Another electric shock and they jump four, five steps immediately. A day or two I may let them rest there, but not more than that.\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHY IS THE MEDIA SO NERVOUS AROUND YOU?\nA: Because they have never come across a man like I am. The media knows politicians, popes, other kinds of leaders. They are all afraid of the media and nervous. The politician is nervous, he has reasons to be nervous. And the journalist is assertive and aggressive, and the politician is simply dodging and trying to save his skull.\nA few days ago I saw an interview with Rajiv Gandhi, who has become now the prime minister of India. He was here in America. The interviewer goes on continuously hammering and Rajiv Gandhi looks almost frozen, as if any moment his breathing is going to stop. And I can see the reason, because the interviewer tried in different ways to get Rajiv Gandhi to say something against Russia. That Rajiv Gandhi cannot do. Before coming to America, first he had gone to Russia. In fact, he must have been prepared there in Russia, what to say and what not to say, because India is almost in the hands of Russia. It is not a communist country but on the very verge. Any day it is going to become a communist country.\nThe interviewer was also trying to force Rajiv to say something against America. That he cannot do. In America, he has come to create more friendship, he has come to get more uranium for nuclear weapons in India, he cannot say anything against America. He cannot praise America, either, because Soviet Russia will get upset. He cannot praise Soviet Russia because America will get upset. So, naturally, the politician is nervous before the media.\nI have no problem. I can say exactly what I want to say. All the media become nervous because they know they will not be able even to report the things I say, because if they take all these things to the editor, perhaps they may be thrown out of the job. They are nervous because what I am saying is also hurting their prejudices. They are human beings. First they are human beings, then they may be journalists; first Christians, then they may be journalists. And when I am hitting on Jesus they want to scream, but they cannot do that. Naturally, it becomes a nervous feeling. They forget to ask what they wanted to ask. They have never met a man like me who has nothing to lose, who can say anything, who does not belong to your society, who does not care about respectability.\nNow the pope is continuously concerned that his respectability as the greatest religious leader in the world should not be affected by any statement. All his statements are prepared by other bishops, looked at by a committee, everything is edited. He is simply a spokesman, he is not speaking himself The whole church, the Catholic hierarchy is decisive. He has just to speak what they teach him, what they tell him to say.\nAnother fundamental reason they get nervous is that I am an absolutely free man. I don't care about contradicting myself, so they cannot put me into a corner by saying, \"You said this fifteen years ago, now you are saying that.\" They cannot put me into any corner. I say forget it, to hell with those fifteen years. Whatever I am saying now is true now. Tomorrow I do not promise I will say the same thing, because I don't bother about consistency, about respectability, about what people will think. I have no reason to be nervous, I simply enjoy their nervousness.\nIt is strange, something new. The table with the water is placed by the side of the person who is being interviewed. When he feels nervous he can start drinking just to do something: get busy, forget nervousness, and meanwhile he has time also to think what to say next. Here it is just the opposite. The water and everything is placed by the side of the media. And I see them plucking grapes, taking water, tossing and turning in their chair, sometimes looking at the photographer, sometimes at the director. They will never forget the interview, because that kind of interview is never going to happen to them unless they come here again, to have another nervous breakdown.\nBut my work is first to give you a nervous breakdown, because only from there is there a possibility of a spiritual breakthrough. Breakdown to breakthrough, that's the whole story.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #11 Chapter title: No God But Godliness 28 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 22.]\nBob Fleming\nDAVIS ENTERPRISES DAVIS, CALIFORNIA\nQUESTION: I SUPPOSE I AM FROM PROBABLY THE SMALLEST NEWSPAPER EVER TO INTERVIEW YOU. WE HAVE VERY INTELLIGENT READERS, THOUGH. I BROUGHT YOU A SMALL PRESENT, A COPY OF THE PAPER, SO YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT DAVIS. MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE IN MY TOWN HAVE HEARD OF YOU AND RAJNEESHPURAM HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION AND IN THE NEWSPAPERS. NONE OF THEM HAS BEEN HERE THAT I KNOW OF AND I KNOW THE TWO DAYS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED. IN FACT, WHEN I CALLED MY EDITOR TO SAY I HAD AN INTERVIEW, SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID YOU GUYS WOULDN'T LET ME COME BACK!\nSO, ANYWAY, DAVIS IS A VERY ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS KIND OF TOWN, AND IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE NEED A STRUCTURE OR FRAMEWORK TO?UNDERSTAND YOU. YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT A PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION.… CAN YOU STATE IN ORDINARY AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS TERMS WHAT YOU STAND FOR?\nANSWER: It is very difficult for me, almost impossible, because I never adjust to speak with you or anybody. I speak, you have to adjust with me to listen. It does not matter whether your readers are middle class, higher class, or lower class. I will say the same thing. If they are middle, they will have to raise their heads up a little to understand, for the simple reason that whatever I am saying, I have brought to its simplest form. To make it more simple is just not possible.\nI am not a philosopher. The philosopher thinks about the truth. His approach is rational. Reason is his instrument, and here just the opposite is the case. I am an irrational man. And the people who have gathered around me -- around the world -- the appeal to them is my irrationality, because reason has failed so utterly. For three thousand years in the West, ten thousand years in the East,\nphilosophers have been struggling to find the truth, and not a single philosopher has been able to find it.\nThe way of philosophy does not go with truth at all. It is just rational gymnastics. So one philosopher can argue against another philosopher, and they go on arguing for centuries, but they have not come to agreement on a single point. Philosophy is the worst wastage of human intelligence that is possible. When I say I am not a philosopher, I simply mean that my approach towards reality is not through the head, it is through the heart.\nI also say that I do not preach a religion because religion is something like love -- you cannot teach it. There is no way to teach love, and if you teach love and somebody becomes trained under your teachings, he may go to Hollywood and become an actor, but he will never become a lover. Your very teaching, your very discipline will be the barrier. So I say I don't teach religion. Religion is something that passes heart to heart, not head to head. The moment religion passes head to head, it becomes theology. It is no more religion.\nI compare it with love because that is the only human experience that comes a little close to the experience of truth. The only difference is that in love, you need somebody else... at least two is a basic necessity. Whom are you going to love? Who is going to respond to you? So love is a dialogue; religion is a monologue. You don't have anybody there -- God, some messiah, some prophet. There is no one with whom you can have a dialogue. You, in utter silence, feel it. It is simply a state of mind at rest -- and the heart throbbing in a deep harmony with existence.\nSo I cannot call it a religion the way Christianity is, the way other religions are. They can manage to give you a catechism which the middle class people will understand. For example, middle class people can even understand the atheist who says God does not exist. They may not agree with him, but they can understand what he is saying. They can understand the priest who says God exists. They understand, the statements are simple. My position is a little more delicate.\nI say there is no God, but there is godliness. So I destroy God as a person. He becomes more like a fragrance than a flower. I am not a theist because I don't believe in God as a person creating the world. I am not an atheist because I am taking God higher than he has ever been. From a quantity I am transforming him into a quality. But I am not a theist and I am not an atheist. And for people to understand godliness is certainly a little difficult. It is as difficult as if you tell me that you come from a town where everybody is blind, and ask me to say something about light so those people can understand.\nWhat can I say about light to people who are blind, who have never experienced light? There have been preachers around for centuries telling blind people what light looks like, what light is. And there are three hundred religions and three hundred different definitions of light. They all cannot be true, but they all can be false. In the first place to try to make an endeavor explaining light to the blind is\nstupid. What the blind man needs is not a priest, but a physician, not a teacher, but a surgeon who can give him eyes. It is not a question of giving him the definition of light. The question is to give him eyes. If he can see, he will never ask what light is -- he will know. But the priests have been preventing people because they go on supplying definitions of light to the blind.\nAnd of course, nobody wants to be ignorant. That's why people believe. It is not coming from their hearts, because it is not their experience. Anything that is your experience is bound to have its roots in your heart. But people cling to beliefs about things which they don't know. They cling for a simple reason: they cannot accept that they are ignorant. And the first step to understand is to accept the fact that, \"I do not know.\"\nThose middle class people about whom you are asking, they are all knowers. You may think they are middle class, but they all know God exists. What kind of God... Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan.… They know the holy book. They know the holy Koran, the holy Gita. And everything is known to them, that's what they think. They know nothing -- knowing should be your experience, and they confuse knowledgeability with knowing. And my effort is to prepare the ground for knowing, not for faith, belief. So only the very intelligent people can come to me.\nBut remember one thing: the greatest intelligent people have come from the middle class. The poor man is so hungry and starving, he has no energy for thinking and inquiring about truth. He is searching for bread and butter. His basic physiological needs are not fulfilled, so no genius has ever come from the poor. It is impossible.\nFrom the rich it is also impossible, for a totally different reason. The rich man has everything that he needs. He misses all the challenges of life. He is too much protected, and if you protect a child too much you will cripple him. What does he need intelligence for?\nWhen I was a student in the university, I met a student who had been in the same master's degree class for ten years continuously! I could not believe it. I asked him and he said, \"Who cares about passing? I enjoy being among the students. I have money, I have time, I have a car. I can get the most beautiful girl any time. I don't come here to learn geography and history and psychology. I am not concerned, I am not interested. What can they give me? If I pass and I have a degree, that cannot make me richer. I am already too rich.\"\nGeniuses have never come from the super-rich people, they are born in the middle class. The middle class has been the source of all great scientists, mystics, philosophers, so don't take middle class in a derogatory way.\nAnd what is the reason why the middle class brings intelligence to its climax? The reason is simple: the middle class is continuously struggling to reach higher. There is a possibility for the middle class to enter into the richer class. It is just there, a little more effort and he will cross the boundary of being a middle class person. There are only a few rungs on the ladder. It is not impossible for a\nmiddle class man to conceive himself becoming super-rich. This is one side, he goes on sharpening his intelligence. On the other side, he is always afraid of falling down among the poor. So he is fighting a double fight. First, not to fall into the poor class, not to become a proletarian; second, he is fighting, competing, because he can see the goal is not far away. Just a few steps more and he has arrived. This gives him a double chance of sharpening his intelligence. That's why all the geniuses have come from the middle class.\nSo don't be worried about the middle class in your city. They are fortunate to be in the middle class. To be poor is ugly; to be super-rich makes your life closer to vegetation. The rich man is almost a cabbage, perhaps a cauliflower. The difference is not much: the cauliflower is only a cabbage with a college degree.\nI am absolutely certain they will understand what I have to say, but I will not adjust, because I don't compromise on anything. I say the way I feel to say. Whether anyone understands or not, it is their business. I will not come down and compromise and say things which are appealing to them, which they can understand. What can they understand? Only that which they already know, for which they have been conditioned. They can understand absurd, idiotic things.\nJust now, I saw a newspaper cutting that the prophet Mohammed teaches Mohammedans that the woman has only one chance of reaching paradise, no other qualification is needed from her. Only one chance, one simple chance, and that is to make her husband entirely satisfied as far as sex is concerned. Great! This is the qualification to enter into paradise, just to satisfy the husband sexually. Mohammed says that the woman cannot say no any time the husband wants to make love to her, because her no is a sin. And, you may believe or you may not believe, he says that even if the husband and wife are riding a camel and the husband wants to make love on the camel's back, the wife should not say no. And these people have been teachers, masters, prophets, God's messengers. Great messages God is sending: make love on the back of a camel. Just to sit on the back of a camel is so difficult! Lovemaking itself is such gymnastics, and to do those gymnastics on the camel's back. It will be really a scene! And these are\nthe messages that are being sent, and these are the messengers. He is simply a male chauvinist, just trying to make women into complete slaves. But Mohammedans have never questioned it. Mohammed himself married nine women. Nobody told him that the quantity of men and women on the earth is equal, almost equal, that to marry nine women means you are depriving eight men of having wives. And these eight men are not just going to be sitting and waiting. They will do something. They will become homosexuals.\nYou may not know that in Mohammedan countries homosexuality is thought the biggest crime. And for homosexuality, the only punishment is the death sentence. Now, I cannot see the logic. On the one hand, Mohammed allows every Mohammedan at least four wives. Of course, he is a prophet, so he has nine, but his followers, because they are his followers, are entitled to have only four wives.\nThis is so unscientific, unbiological, that the remaining men are bound to become homosexuals, perverts.\nBut nobody, not a single Mohammedan in the fourteen centuries since Mohammed, has even bothered. Christians can understand perfectly well any absurdity that is Christian. They can accept that Jesus was born out of a virgin mother. They know perfectly well it is not the way of nature. The whole story that the holy ghost makes her pregnant is a cover-up. Who is this fellow, the holy ghost? And why did he stop making other virgins pregnant? He has done a great job, giving Jesus to the world. He should be continuously making virgins pregnant. The more Jesuses, the better. But he did it only once -- never before, never after -- just a single act and the holy ghost has disappeared. Nobody bothers to ask. If he is a Christian, he will accept the virgin birth. He will accept the resurrection of Jesus after death.\nPeople understand easily what they have been conditioned for. And my work is unconditioning people, deprogramming people. There are other deprogrammers, but they are not really deprogrammers, they are reprogrammers. If some Christian starts becoming a Hindu, they will deprogram the person and reprogram him back into Christianity. I simply deprogram, and then leave you alone. I have no program to give you. I want you to be totally alone, fresh, without any borrowed knowledge. Because only then there is a possibility of experiencing the beauty of this existence, the ecstasy of being alive, the meaning, the truth.\nIf anybody really wants to understand, he should come here. For a seeker, an inquirer, Rajneeshpuram is not far away. People are coming here from all over the world. If a person is here for a certain period of time, experiencing the people who are here, the way they relate, the climate of love, the serenity of the place, the silent communication between me and my people -- if they can come and dance, sing, and be part of us -- then perhaps they will get something, a taste that you cannot describe. Nobody has been able to describe what sweetness is. The only way is to drink a Coca-Cola.\nI am a drunkard. I am drunk twenty-four hours. The source of my drugs is inside me, so no government can catch me. There is no way to find out from where I am getting my champagne. And my people slowly, slowly start getting drunk. So it is a question of taste. If you can simply provoke those people that there is something worth tasting, that they should not miss it, then it will be possible for them to understand whatever I am saying. I use simple language, I have no jargon. I am not an expert about anything. To understand me is very easy.\nThe problem arises that you cannot understand me just through words. And it is not a new problem, it has always been so. The person who experiences something in his innermost core finds it difficult to translate it into language, because language is created for mundane affairs. What can lovers say to each other? At the most, \"I love you.\" And if, unfortunately, the woman has a philosophical mind and asks, \"What is love, what is it that you are proposing?\"\nexplain that first you have to understand what love is, only then can you understand whether to take it or not.\nFortunately women are not philosophers. They don't ask what love is. In fact, they know more of love than men. It is men who have created all kinds of violence on the earth, and are preparing to destroy the whole life on earth. It is absolutely men's responsibility. Women have not been participants in it. But if a woman has a philosophical mind, then no lover can explain. Then the only way is, rather than saying, \"I love you,\" he starts making gestures of love, holding her hand, dancing with her, looking into her eyes, singing with her, listening to the music, or just sitting silently together looking at the night, the stars. Perhaps just being together something will transpire.\nAnd that is love. It is a transfer of some invisible energy, and exactly the same thing is religion. One who has known his own being is capable of sharing his being with you, and in that sharing, something will be triggered in you. And the moment you know the truth, it will not be the truth of the Master, it will be your own. He has never given you truth. He has never talked about it. He has not said a single word about it, because nothing can be said about truth.\nAll words are futile as far as truth is concerned. No word has the potentiality to express values like truth, joy, blissfulness, ecstasy. There is no way. But one thing you can do. You can give them a challenge: if there is something worth experiencing, at least don't condemn it before you have experienced it. And I know that anybody who comes here open and ready to learn puts his conditioning aside and forgets that he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan.\nIt is a very simple and natural phenomenon. It starts happening to you. It is happening, and that's the purpose of creating communes around the world. So that anywhere there is a group of a thousand or two thousand people vibrating with their meditative energy, dancing to abandon, singing madly, ecstatic for nothing, a man is going to get drunk just being in an open contact with the commune. There have been teachers, great masters, but what they were doing was theology, not religion. Religion needs a human lab, and that's what the commune is; because religion is the highest human engineering.\nIt is said -- and perhaps it is true. In India, music is a very ancient tradition, and\nIndian music has qualities of its own, its beauty, its silence. It is not sexual the way jazz is sexual or the Beatles are sexual. It is something totally different. Listening to the classical music you will feel something coming from a different world. In the history of Indian music it is said, and perhaps it is true, that if in a silent room a master sitar player plays the sitar and you keep a few other sitars in the room, soon those other sitars start vibrating. Nobody is playing on them, but they start getting in tune with the master player. And I see every possibility that it is not just a story, because vibrations can hit those sitars; just a master player, a maestro is needed.\nIn Indian music there are ragas. A raga is a certain type of music for a certain period of time. For example, for the morning, one raga; for the evening, another; for the middle of the night, another. Around the clock those ragas are played, but each has its own time. And it is really strange, that if you play the raga that is meant to be played in the early morning, in the evening, it does not create the same climax within you. The same man is playing, but something is missing.\nIt is just like at sunrise when the birds start singing and the flowers open up. At sunset the birds stop singing, the flowers start closing. Existence is going into rest, so there is a different music for this moment which will be in tune with the whole existence. There is a different tune for the morning Because the sun is rising, your music should be harmonious with the rising energy, the wakening energy of existence.\nI am not a musician, but I have meditated around the clock, and I was surprised that a certain method functions at a certain period, perhaps in the morning. Another method opens the doors in the evening, and you cannot use the same method for the morning.\nIn a commune where five thousand meditators are living, working, being, you will get drunk. It is bound to happen. So the people were really right when they told you, \"Don't go there, we are afraid you may not come back again.\" It has happened to many, and I can see the possibility that it can happen to you. Because who would like to leave this beautiful commune for that ugly world that exists outside with all the politicians, with all the rapes and murders, and everybody trying to cut everybody else's throat? Who wants to live there? Here there is no competition, no struggle, no crime. People don't have time. Either they are meditating or they are working or they are loving. There is no time to do anything stupid.\nI have no philosophy, I have no religion; yet, I inspire people for a different kind of life which is religiousness, divineness, godliness. But my emphasis is that all nouns are wrong, only verbs are right. When you say, \"Look at this tree,\" when you say, \"This is a tree,\" you are not stating exactly that the tree is not a noun, and cannot be a noun, because it is growing. It is treeing. In existence there are no nouns at all. The river is rivering, the tree is treeing. Each moment you are somebody else. Each moment you are growing.\nThe growth never stops, and if you are consciously helping the growth, then you will not only grow old, you will also grow up into wisdom -- which brings peace to the heart and which brings the light which reveals to you the immortality of your being. And at the same time it reveals the immortality of everything in existence. Things go on changing their form, but nobody dies.\nDeath is illusory, it has never happened; only consciousness is transmigrating into other bodies. And I don't want people to believe me, I don't teach transmigration of the soul. I simply help them to come to that space where they will be able to know it on their own. If a person can see his past lives, which is\nvery simple, if he can see his thousands of past lives stretching to eternity, the logical conclusion is that he is going to continue in the future also to eternity. Eternity to eternity.\nWith that experience, all fear disappears, because all fear is somehow rooted in death which is coming closer every day. We try to deceive ourselves and others in every possible way. We make our graveyards outside the city so that we are not reminded of death again and again. Whenever you pass by the graveyard, the thought is bound to come that sooner or later you will also be lying down in some grave. Perhaps the next grave that is being dug is for you. Nobody knows. It is certainly for someone, and that someone can be you. We have tried to deceive ourselves with the belief that the soul will not die. But that is a belief, and belief is just useless. It won't help you to any transformation. You are believing it because it is helpful. You can keep your eyes closed to death, although you know that this is only a belief, that life is eternal.\nSo I don't teach any belief I teach methods of how to enter into different spaces which are available inside you. So those who are interested, bring them. Perhaps what they have not found in their whole life they may find here in this small oasis in the desert of Oregon. And don't think at all that those middle class people will not understand me.\nQ: I APPRECIATE THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR ANSWER. I DON'T REMEMBER MY QUESTION, BUT I'M SURE YOU ANSWERED IT.\nA: That's good.\nQ: SINCE AMERICANS, AND ESPECIALLY OREGONIANS, PRIDE THEMSELVES AS HAVING THE LAND OF THE FREE -- WE HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME AT GRADE SCHOOLS, NATIONAL ANTHEMS AND SO ON -- WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO OPPOSED -- I MEAN NOT JUST OPPOSED, BUT REALLY ARDENTLY OPPOSED -- TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO?\nA: I'm not surprised by it. If I was not opposed then certainly I would have been surprised.\nIt is just a natural phenomenon. If you have been miserable your whole life, if you have lived in a society where everybody is miserable -- they all have their styles of being miserable, different colors, different shades, but basically everybody is miserable -- then you don't see people just laughing for no reason, or just dancing because the moon is full tonight. Your society condemns such people as crazy. So when they have to encounter a commune like this, their first reaction is that if such blissfulness has not happened to them, these people and their existence prove to them that they have missed the train.\nIt will be good that these people are removed, destroyed, because they become a question mark. It hurts that there are people who are happy: Why am i not happy? If others have been able to manage it, then what is wrong with me that I cannot manage it?\nA great inferiority complex arises. And whenever you are under the impact of feeling inferior, there are only two ways to think: either think that these people are mad, perhaps hypnotized, or that something is wrong with them. But this explanation cannot stand long, because these people are doing everything so intelligently, they cannot be mad. They are so conscious and alert, they cannot be just moving like robots, hypnotized. They are not sleepwalkers. So condemn them, that they are immoral, that they are against God, that they are not religious.\nJust condemn them so you can feel a certain guarantee that you have not missed life. Whatever life has, you have: television, a car, a good job, a wife, children. This is what life gives, so you have got it. But these people have got something else, and that hurts. Condemn them. Find out bogus, false charges against them. I invite these people just to come close and see, but they are afraid to come close, because deep down they know they will be infected by these people, and they will be left in a limbo.\nAll their investments are there in the world. Here, they will be coming into a strange space where they have no idea even what is happening, where these people are going. And there is the conflict in the mind of leaving the old world, where you had all your acquaintances and friends and family. They also were all miserable, so there was a certain affinity, a family feeling, a certain equality; there you cannot risk. Those who come here only come if they have the guts to risk.\nYou mentioned that they can tolerate Olympics, they can tolerate boxing, they can tolerate every other thing, and asked, \"Why are they against you?\" The reason is clear. The boxing does not make them feel inferior. In fact, the boxing helps them to release their violence. California University has been studying why, after a boxing match, violence increases immediately fourteen percent. They have studied only violence. They should also study other things after boxing -- how many more rapes happen, how many more murders happen, how many more suicides happen -- and you will find they are all increased.\nThe society is so violent, so full of violence that just a football match, and people are ready to kill each other. A boxing match is simply ugly, barbarous. People enjoying two persons hitting each other like animals, breaking their noses, hurting their eyes, bringing blood... and people are clapping and shouting and enjoying. They get in some way identified with one of the fighters. Everybody in the stadium is identified with one wrestler, boxer. His victory is their victory. When he hits the enemy they are hitting the enemy. It is unconscious, but it is a release.\nThose who have too much violence, when just the identification won't help, they raise the percentage of actual violence after the match is over. For four days the percentage remains higher and then slowly it goes down. The same is true about football matches, about Olympics. They fit perfectly in their violent society. Even war fits perfectly. Nuclear weapons fit perfectly.\nI am nonviolent and I stand for love, not for war. And I don't see that there is any need... things like boxing should be absolutely prohibited. They are ugly and barbarous. People can go there, thousands go, and millions of people are sitting glued to their chairs before the TV. It is strange that violence is so much appreciated, enjoyed. These people must be all carrying some violence in them, otherwise I don't see it, I cannot enjoy boxing. It is disgusting.\nThe phenomenon of the commune is just the opposite, and that's why it is so troublesome to them. If we were also boxers here, eating meat, doing all kinds of crime, they would have been perfectly happy to accept us. We are strangers to them. It hurts their egos. We are creating civilization. Up to now it has been only a word.\nThe Romans thought they had come to the peak of their civilization, and at the peak, what were they enjoying? Throwing Christians to hungry lions. I think they must have been very compassionate people. They could see lions hungry, and they provided the best food they could find. Why were they against Christians? The same reason: in the beginning Christianity was a stranger.\nNow nobody is against Christians because Christians have compromised with the society. They are only nominally Christians. Sunday morning religion is their whole religion, and their church is nothing but a club where they go to gossip. And nobody listens to the priest. There is nothing to listen to. That man has been repeating the same sermon again and again, but he can repeat the same sermon because nobody is listening.\nI have heard that a Christian minister was very much disturbed by one old man who was the richest man of his congregation. Of course, he used to sit just in front of the priest, but he was old and he had heard these sermons so many times that they were like sleeping pills for him. The moment the priest would start he would fall asleep. That was not a problem; the problem was he snored. But he was the richest man, the richest donor. In everything, he was helpful to the church. In fact, he was the only man who was keeping the minister paid, otherwise the congregation would disappear. So the minister could not say anything to the man; but complaints started coming to him from other people.\nThey were saying, \"We are not against his sleeping, he can go to sleep for good. What troubles us is that he disturbs our sleep by snoring. And just a beautiful Sunday morning and one feels so good to have a little nap. But this old man. \"\nThe old man used to come with his great-grandson. The boy enjoyed sitting there by the side of the old man. The priest took him away from the old man and told him, \"I will give you one dollar every Sunday if you keep hitting the old man with your elbow so that he does not fall asleep. That is your work.\" The boy said,\n\"Done! There is no problem. I will not let him sleep a single moment, but I don't believe in priests and I don't trust them. Pay me in advance.\"\nThe priest gave him one dollar, and the next Sunday morning the boy continued pushing the old man with his elbow. The old man was very angry, and looked at the boy again and again, but he could not say anything. The priest was there, the whole congregation was there, but he did not allow him to sleep.\nOutside, the old man was enraged. He said, \"You stupid. What happened to you? Why did you go on hitting me with your elbow and waking me up? I'm old, in the nights I don't have any sleep. This is the only place where at least for one hour, one and a half hours, I can have a good time. Doctors have failed. In fact, doctors have suggested, 'Why don't you start going to Sunday sermon? When we fail to give sleep to any patient we send him to the church, and it always succeeds without exception.'\n\"So, you rascal,\" he said to the boy, \"you disturbed my whole joy; now I will have to wait one week again. But what went wrong, why were you doing this? You were always sitting silently.\" The boy said, \"It is something concerning business.\" The old man said, \"What business? What business have you started doing?\" He showed him the dollar. \"The priest is paying me one dollar to keep you awake.\" The old man said, \"Then you should have told me before. I will give you two dollars every week. Don't disturb me.\" The boy said, \"So far, so good. The business is going good. Two dollars, in advance.\"\nHe got the advance, and the next Sunday morning he was sitting silently. The priest made many hints, but the child would not look at him at all. He would look here, there, everywhere else. The priest said, \"What has happened to this boy? Last Sunday was so peaceful.\" After the service, the priest caught hold of the boy and said, \"You are cheating me. I am giving you one dollar per sermon. Why have you stopped hitting the old man?\" The boy said, \"He is giving me two dollars for not hitting him. Now if you want, the price has gone up. If you give me three dollars I will keep him awake.\"\nThe priest said, \"I cannot compete with your old man. He is so rich he can give you any amount of money. I am a poor priest. Three dollars per sermon, I will go bankrupt.\"\nThese people who go to the churches are no disturbance to the society. It is their society. Jesus was a disturbance, hence they crucified him. After Jesus, his apostles started compromising with the society, and what a coincidence. He was crucified by the order of the emperor of Rome, and later on Rome became the capital of world Christianity.\nExistence works in strange ways. These people who are against me, hostile towards me and my people, one day you will find them in red clothes. I just have to manage to be assassinated. Then everything will be good, then I will gain their sympathy. Right now I am such a disturbance. They have never conceived such a religious man, one who has ninety Rolls Royces, hundreds of diamond watches, and a 126-square-mile ranch, three times bigger than New York. Naturally they\nshould be offended. I am responsible for their being offended. And I am trying to introduce a totally new religious phenomenon which goes against their morality, their etiquette.\nEverything that they have, my commune goes against it. Because I have seen one thing clearly: every society is an organic whole. If there is rape, murder, theft, and all kinds of crimes and perversions, then whatever good is there is so interconnected with the bad that we stand even against those things that appear good. We can see the interconnection between the good and the bad. They are two sides of the same coin, and we have renounced both. We are amoral people. We are not immoral, we are not moral.\nWe are amoral people. This is their problem. They can deal with moral people, they can deal with immoral people, but they don't know how to deal with us. It is so new to them, they are puzzled and confused. But this is really the shock of the beginning of a new man. These are the birth pangs. The society is going, but we are going to continue to grow -- not in spite of them, but because of them. If they are hostile and they hate us, we are already connected. We have a certain relationship already. Sometimes friendship is not so deep as enmity.\nJust the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin: \"I love you. My wife likes you but does not love you. I love my wife. I want to move to a commune, and now I am in great difficulty. My wife likes you but she is not ready to move to the commune. She does not love you that much. I love you so much I want to move, but what will happen to my wife and children? I am in a dilemma.\" When I heard the letter I said, \"This man is going to be in great difficulty.\" If the wife hated me, things would have been simple, but she likes me. Like never changes into love. Hate has the capacity to change into love. In fact, it is love standing on its head.\nI am really happy that people are hostile. How long can they remain hostile? And they are unnecessarily wasting their time and energy, and having nightmares, and we don't care a bit. We are not bothered. We are enjoying the time that is available to us. Tomorrow is uncertain, so we are not going to sacrifice today for any tomorrow. We are existential people. Just this moment is so much, who cares whether the next moment we survive or not?\nBut they will have to change their attitude. You cannot carry hostility long. It starts disturbing your stomach, raises your pulse beat, and gives you heart attacks. We have not done any harm to anybody. They are doing it on their own. They are creating it for their own death. If they understand just a little psychology, before becoming hostile, please come and become acquainted. I am not a missionary and I don't convert anybody.\nIf a person wants to be converted, wants to become a sannyasin, that is his responsibility. We are not making any effort to change any man, because I think that is trespassing, and I respect the individual as one of the highest values in the world.\nQ: I'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY MORE QUESTIONS. MAYBE WE GO TO A TRUE/FALSE FORMAT.\nA: Next time. Next time, and till all your questions are finished, go on coming. And when all questions are finished, then what are you going to do? Be careful.\nQ: THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #12 Chapter title: A Fellow Traveler 29 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 23.]\nLynn Hudson INDIA ABROAD NEW YORK\nQUESTION: YES, BHAGWAN, I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 'INDIA ABROAD.' IT'S AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE WEEKLY NEWSPAPER ABOUT INDIANS AND ABOUT INDIA, MAINLY FOR INDIAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, OR ASIAN INDIANS IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT IT IS CIRCULATED SOMEWHAT IN INDIA, AS WELL. ANOTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT I HAVE COVERED THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS COMMUNITY SINCE ITS INCEPTION. SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FOUR YEARS NOW, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR REACTIONS ARE TO AMERICA, AMERICANS AND AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS.\nANSWER: America is not what it pretends to be. It is just a second Soviet Union. But they are truthful; America is hypocritical. The democracy is just in the name, it does not function.\nQ: WOULD YOU LIVE IN THE SOVIET UNION?\nA: I am living in the Soviet Union. Oregon is a state in the Soviet Union.\nQ: WELL, IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT, WHY ARE YOU HAPPY HERE? OR ARE YOU HAPPY HERE?\nA: I am happy anywhere.\nQ: EVEN IN A PLACE AS OPPRESSIVE AS THE UNITED STATES?\nA: Yes, even in Oregon.\nQ: HOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ONES THAT YOU'VE MET, THAT YOU'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH? OR THE ONES THAT YOU'VE READ ABOUT?\nA: I know only the Americans who are with me, but they are no longer Americans. I don't come in contact with other Americans, because I never go anywhere.\nQ: BUT MANY AMERICANS COME HERE TO SEE YOU, DO THEY NOT? THE PARENTS OF YOUR SANNYASINS, AND OTHERS?\nA: I don't meet them. Thousands of Americans are my sannyasins, but the man who becomes a sannyasin drops all hangovers: American, Christian, Hindu, Indian, Mohammedan, communist. He throws all that crap away. That is the essential thing for a sannyasin to do, to be just a human being without any labels. Man is not a commodity that you can label. To label human beings is ugly. So there are people who were once Americans who have become sannyasins. I can tell you about them; they are in contact with me. They are some of the best and most beautiful people in the world.\nQ: I WONDER IF I MIGHT ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD IN INDIA? WHAT WAS IT LIKE? HOW DID OTHER CHILDREN RELATE TO YOU? HOW DID YOU RELATE TO THEM? HOW DID THEY FEEL ABOUT YOU? HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF AS A CHILD?\nA: I was a little strange as a child. I never played with any children because deep down I never felt that I was their age. In my childhood I was discussing with adults, old people, but my relationship with my own age group was nil.\nQ: YOU FELT YOURSELF A TEACHER EVEN THEN, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?\nA: Yes. I have always felt that I have something to give, and as I grew up, that thing became more and more clear. I had always related with people who were at least twenty, thirty years older than me, only with them could I argue and discuss things in which other children were not interested.\nQ: DID THIS MAKE YOU AN OUTCAST WITH CHILDREN YOUR OWN AGE? DID THAT MATTER TO YOU?\nA: I was an outcast, and I am still an outcast. Perhaps that's my fate, my destiny -\n- to be the outsider -- but I have enjoyed it my whole life. I don't remember a single moment when I have felt badly about whatever I am. I have rejoiced in my being and I have kept my freedom completely intact. Nobody has been an\ninfluence on me -- neither a teacher, nor a professor, nor a saint, a religious leader, a political leader. In fact, as I grew up and my arguments became sharper, teachers and professors were afraid of me. And I was not just an outsider; I was expelled from many colleges for the simple reason that the professors felt embarrassed. They were not able to answer my questions, and they were not courageous enough to accept my answers.\nQ: DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMIC THERE, THOUGH, IN YOUR FEELING AN OUTCAST, THAT LED YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF FORMING A COMMUNE OF WHICH YOU ARE THE CENTER?\nA: I have not made the commune. I started on the way alone. People started coming to me and it became a vast caravan which is now spread all over the world. And people are still coming. I have not made it, it has happened. It was not a planned thing, not something considered.\nI don't have any discipline, any rules, any regulations. Somebody coming and becoming a fellow traveler is welcome. If he leaves at some crossroads, we say goodbye to him with the same joy, ecstasy, as we had when he joined us. And we tell him, \"Whenever you want, the doors will always be open for you.\"\nBut I have not made the commune. Certainly, when five thousand people are living here, so many arrangements have to be made; but all that credit goes to the sannyasins. I have nothing to do with it.\nQ: THE ADULATION THAT IS OBVIOUSLY FELT FOR YOU HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY, DOES THAT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HUMILITY OR A SENSE OF OMNIPOTENCE?\nA: Just ecstasy.\nQ: I BEG YOUR PARDON?\nA: Just ecstasy, it gives to me. It does not give me a bigger ego; it does not give me the opposite, the humble ego. They are both egos. Sometimes the humble man is more egoistic than the straightforward egoist. As far as I am concerned, it is not adoration. They rejoice. They love me. I am not higher than them; they are my friends, my lovers, on an equal basis as far as I am concerned. Now it is up to them whether to listen to me or not to listen.\nQ: ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ASKING, I GUESS, IS WHAT DOES IT DO TO YOUR HEAD, AS THEY SAY, TO FEEL ALL THIS LOVE? -- I MEAN, AS A HUMAN BEING TO BE THE CENTER OF SO MUCH WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, LOVE, ADORATION, ADULATION?\nA: I rejoice. It is beautiful to have so many hearts beating in the same tune as my heart is beating.\nQ: DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE AS HAPPY IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE SANNYASINS AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LEADER?\nA: I cannot be more happy; I cannot be less happy. Happiness is something that is within me, it is not dependent on anybody. If all the sannyasins are gone, I will be happy with the trees, I will be happy with the stars. And I can dance with the trees and the stars; it does not matter -- I can dance in my bathroom. I am a happy person.\nQ: IN REGARD TO THE REMARKS YOU MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD GATHER THAT YOU DO COMMENT ON POLITICS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR FEELINGS ARE ABOUT RAJIV GANDHI AND THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\nA: Rajiv Gandhi is just an amateur politician, knowing nothing about politics, and he is going to be destructive. He is going to impose the same emergency that his mother did. All that he knows is his mother and he simply will be repeating what she has done.\nQ: SO YOU FORESEE ANOTHER EMERGENCY?\nA: Another emergency, another assassination. And this time it is going to be worse than before.\nQ: WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS OF SIKHISM AND OF THE SIKH EXTREMIST ELEMENTS?\nA: Sikhs are beautiful people. Perhaps the community of the Sikhs is the only community in the whole of India you can rely upon for something. They are simple, courageous people -- most trustworthy, reliable, not cunning. They are unafraid of anything; otherwise, the Indians are cowards.\nQ: DO YOU FAVOR SEPARATE STATEHOOD FOR PUNJAB?\nA: India has never been one nation and can never be. It is something forcibly put together. In Gautam Buddha's time, India was divided into two thousand independent nations. It was the Moguls who conquered India and started making other states dissolve into the Mogul empire. They created the background for the British raj. When the Britishers took over, India for the first\ntime became one country -- but forcibly, under slavery, because there was no other way.\nOnce India became independent, all the troubles started. Even before independence, Mohammedans were asking for a separate country of their own. And I think they were not wrong. In a country in which Hindus are a majority, Mohammedans will have no chance. They will be suppressed and Hindus will take the revenge of thousands of years. It was good that Pakistan was taken apart from India. I am in favor of freedom at any cost.\nIf Sikhs want to be free, if they want their own nation, they have every right to have it. To prevent them is undemocratic, against freedom, against the dignity of people. Who is Rajiv Gandhi to prevent them? Who was Indira Gandhi to prevent them? I have been a friend to Indira Gandhi, and she had immense respect for me. But when she was assassinated, I didn't feel sorry. I simply felt it was her own doing. It is a simple thing: if Sikhs want independence, give it to them. Why enforce? -- and other provinces are also asking.\nAssam is asking for independence. Their leaders have been crushed, jailed, or they have escaped from the country, but the fight continues. The same is going to happen sooner or later to the south Indian states, because they don't belong to the north in any way. They are not Aryans as the northern Indians are. They don't have any language derived from Sanskrit as are all the languages of northern India. In color they are different, in culture they are different. Why should they be forced? Everybody should be given independence. Even if India disappears completely, it is perfect. It is disappearing in favor of freedom and democracy.\nQ: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT MRS. GANDHI SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT YOU WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU LEFT INDIA.\nA: I was with Indira Gandhi not with the Indian government.\nQ: HOW DID THAT WORK? WHAT WERE THE DYNAMICS OF THAT?\nA: Because she was interested in my ideas, she was reading my books, and whenever I was passing through New Delhi, she always tried to meet me and discuss with me. She always agreed with what I said to her, but she said, \"I know what you are saying is right, but I cannot do it\" -- because this whole political game is so dirty that if you want to be at the top, you have to follow the whole cunning, hypocritical style.\nQ: WERE THERE PROBLEMS BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER MINISTERS OR DEPARTMENTS OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT?\nA: Yes. With Morarji Desai I have been enemies for many lives. Q: WAS THAT A KEY FACTOR IN YOUR LEAVING INDIA?\nA: No. I remained in India until he was no longer the prime minister. I had made it a point that while he is the prime minister, I was not going outside India. I was hammering him every day, hitting him every day, for the simple reason -- I am not a politician, I am not a competitor to anybody -- that I can't see stupid things happening.\nQ: WHAT WAS YOUR QUARREL WITH DESAI?\nA: Everything -- because I was against his political master, Mahatma Gandhi. I am against the whole philosophy of Gandhiism because it drags people backwards. It is not a forwards movement; it does not take account of the future. It adores, and teaches people to adore, the dead past. He was not ready to accept anything that was invented after the spinning wheel. For him the spinning wheel was the last human invention, for him time had stopped there. This is stupid. On the spinning wheel you cannot keep your country clothed. If a person spins for eight hours every day, then he will be able to have enough clothes just for himself.\nNow this is an idiotic ideology. If a person spins eight hours, then when is he going to earn his food? How is he going to take care of his children, his wife, his old parents? How is he going to have a roof? Gandhi was against simple things: telegraph, telephone, railway. Just think.…\nQ: BUT HAVEN'T YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT'S GOTTEN US INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF A HOLOCAUST?\nA: I have said it, but I have said it from a totally different direction. I say it is technology that has disturbed the whole harmony of nature. Now it is the duty of technology to put it back. Nobody else can do it. I am not against technology; I am simply against the technology which has been growing blindly, unconsciously, unaware of its effects. I would like a better technology, superior to the technology we have, which takes care of nature and human beings. Our whole technology has developed as an effort to destroy.\nQ: BUT NO ONE'S EVER FOUND A WAY TO PUT A CAP ON SCIENCE, HAVE THEY? I MEAN, IT HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN.\nA: It has NOT a life of its own. It is politically dominated. No scientist can manage a nuclear plant. The nuclear plant is owned by the American\ngovernment or the Soviet Union or some other idiots, and the scientist has to work under the direction of the politicians. This technology has not developed independently. Scientists are simply the servants of the politicians; and the moment they start just a little to do something on their own, their careers are finished. In the ancient days it was difficult and different. It was difficult to create all that technology is now creating because it needed a certain background which was not available. Second, it was simpler for a scientist to work independently in his own small lab. Galileo was independent, Copernicus was independent, but not Albert Einstein.\nQ: BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT, DO YOU REALLY SEE A WAY TO PUT THE NUCLEAR GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE WHEN EVEN GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE A NUCLEAR BOMB TODAY?\nA: There is no need to put it back. Any energy which can be destructive can also be creative. It is only a question of application. The nuclear weapons are meant to destroy. The whole science is motivated towards a third world war. The same energy that is being put into making these weapons and these new discoveries can be put into creative ways. There is no need for Ethiopia to starve and die.\nQ: DOES THIS PUT YOU ON THE SIDE OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS?\nA: Not to destroy -- but the energy can be used in a creative way, and the sooner we realize it, the better. All governments should be forced by the people to see that atomic, nuclear, or any kind of energy that is in the service of war, has to be released into the service of humanity to destroy hunger, poverty, unemployment. We can make this earth for the first time a paradise. It will be really so foolish to have so much energy in our hands and destroy the earth, destroy all life.\nQ: HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN GO ABOUT CHANGING THE PRESENT ATTITUDE IN THE WORLD TO CREATE THIS SORT OF FUTURE THAT YOU SEE?\nA: The people just have to be made more alert and aware. They have to be made conscious of what their politicians are doing. And once the politicians see that the masses are no more for war, they will immediately jump ahead of the masses. That's a necessity for being a political leader -- you have to be ahead of the crowd. It is not that the crowd follows you, it is just the opposite. The politician has to keep alert to where the crowd is going, and the successful politician is one who always keeps himself ahead of the masses. The unsuccessful politician is\none who goes on without looking back to see that the followers have taken some other route.\nIt is very simple. Just the people -- the media, all kinds of newspapers and magazines, the universities where intelligence exists -- should start a campaign for consciousness raising. It is not a question of one person, it is a question of life being destroyed.\nQ: AND HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT CREATING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT MANKIND?\nA: I am trying. I am trying in my own way. I have more than half a million sannyasins around the world who are trying in every possible way to raise human consciousness. Perhaps nobody else is doing what I am doing and on such a vast scale. My methods of meditation are in reality sabotaging the political structure that exists anywhere today. If people meditate, they become more rebellious, they become more understanding. Their eyes see more clearly. Their consciousness is on a far higher level. They can become teachers to those who are lagging a little behind. They can help them.\nWithin ten years it is possible we can make humanity alert and aware of their own politicians. American politicians are making Americans aware of the danger of Soviet Russia; Soviet politicians are making Soviet citizens alert to the danger that America is. Americans have to be made aware of the danger of their own politicians. Russians have to try to become aware. I have my sannyasins there --\nof course, they are all underground. Q: HOW MANY IN RUSSIA?\nA: I cannot give you the number. I cannot give you the names. The Russian government is already persecuting the people they have found with my books. A few Russians have escaped and they are here.\nQ: ARE THERE OTHER LEADERS TODAY THAT YOU FEEL ARE WORKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU ARE? OR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS ALONE?\nA: There is nobody. Political leaders cannot do it; it would be suicidal on their part. They would lose all power. The so-called religious leaders have been in deep conspiracy with the politicians for centuries. They are afraid that if people become more alert, more conscious, then who is going to bother about their God? And who is going to believe that there is a God?\nThere have been two religions in India devoted to meditation: Jainism and Buddhism. Both deny the existence of God, for the simple reason that when your consciousness becomes clear, you can see that this God and the creation of the\nworld is all fiction. The religious leaders are afraid of a person like me. They are afraid of my sannyasins. They are afraid because among my sannyasins there are Hindus, there are Mohammedans, Sikhs, Christians and Jews. And of course the moment they become my sannyasins, they have to leave their Jewishness, their Christianity, outside. They cannot bring it in. Naturally the religious leaders will be afraid.\nI am the only person who is condemned by all religious leaders, all political parties. Strange: a single person is being condemned by all those who are against each other. Even communists are against me, socialists are against me. A few days ago, I received a letter from the president of the American Nazi party: \"You are hurting our religious feelings by speaking against Adolf Hitler.\" He told me in the letter that Adolf Hitler was not a politician, he was the reincarnation of the ancient Old Testament prophet Elijah. Now do you think these are the people who are going to raise people's consciousness? They are exploiting people in the name of religion.\nQ: AS I RECALL YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, YOU MENTIONED EUGENICS AS A WAY IN WHICH WE COULD AVOID CREATING OTHER MONSTERS SUCH AS HITLER, STALIN, AND GENGHIS KHAN. IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: Yes, it is right.\nQ: BUT WHEN YOU INTRUDE INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES TO TELL THEM WHEN AND HOW THEY CAN HAVE CHILDREN, ISN'T THAT SOMEWHAT FASCISTIC, SOMEWHAT HITLERIAN IN ITSELF?\nA: No. If you can operate on their cancer, is that Hitlerian? When the doctor says, \"Take this medicine for your tuberculosis,\" is he intruding in your life? Is that fascist? You are entering in everybody's life in every way, but because eugenics is something new, people freak out.\nIn fact, a couple making love has no idea what kind of a child they are going to produce. This is blind biology. It is better to be in the hands of scientists than to be in the hands of blind biology. We can conceive that there can be exploitation, but that is true about any invention, any discovery, any new thing. But I am totally in favor of it, because I see it can really change man even though he has not changed in thousands of years. Since the first monkeys jumped on the earth and started walking on two legs, man is the same. Yes, he wears better clothes, flies in airplanes, but just scratch a little bit and you will find the monkey there.\nQ: IF YOU'LL PARDON A COUPLE OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS, HAVE YOU NEVER WANTED TO HAVE A CHILD YOURSELF?\nA: No, for the simple reason that I don't want to burden this earth. It is already burdened too much. There is no religious reason why my sannyasins are not giving birth to children. In the four years we have been here, not a single baby has been born. And nowhere is so much love being made as is made here.\nQ: THERE'S BEEN A STORY RECENTLY THAT YOU PLAN TO RETURN TO INDIA AND TO MOVE THIS COMMUNE BACK TO INDIA. IS THERE ANY TRUTH IN THAT?\nA: I go on creating many kinds of rumors; they are part of my work. But I am not going anywhere. I am going to remain here.\nQ: WHY ARE YOU DETERMINED TO REMAIN HERE, INASMUCH AS YOU SEEM VERY CRITICAL AND UNFAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARD THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL?\nA: Because I want to spread that idea. I need to be here.\nQ: IS THERE ANY REASON THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY INDIAN SANNYASINS HERE IN OREGON?\nA: Only a few are here... not many. There were not many even when I was in India, for the simple reason that what I am saying goes against their conditioned minds, and they have the oldest conditioned minds in the world. They are so much conditioned over thousands of years that they have become incapable even of listening to anything new. They believe that everything that is true is in their scriptures, that there is no need for anything new. The old is gold. The older it is, the golder it is.\nQ: WERE YOU EVER A PRACTICING HINDU?\nA: Never, never. I have never been practicing any religion. I have been trying to remain an individual on my own, right or wrong, heaven or hell. I have never considered about anything. I want to remain completely myself. It gives a certain strength, freedom, dignity; and that's my teaching to my people. It is not a religion -- it is just the gathering of people who feel some similarity, some synchronicity. But each is respected as an individual.\nThis commune is not an organization, it is an organism just like the body. They are all working on their own responsibility. There is nobody higher, nobody lower; there is no hierarchy. The professor and the plumber are equally respected and loved. In fact, nobody even bothers whether you are a plumber or a professor. Nobody even asks anybody, \"What are you doing?\" because\neverybody is doing what is needed. So all are equal; they are fulfilling the needs of the commune in different ways, in the way they can fulfill.\nQ: WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE THING THAT BRINGS YOU ALL TOGETHER?\nA: I had not come here to stay. I had come here because my health was bad. My back was so bad that we tried everything.… Experts from England were called but they could not fix it. I was suffering from asthma so much that sleep became difficult. I am allergic to all kinds of perfume, smoke, dust; any small thing immediately triggers my coughing and then it goes on for hours.\nOtherwise, why should I choose Oregon? It is a desert, dry. Humidity is dangerous for me. Whenever I went to Bombay, attacks of asthma would immediately increase. And whenever I went to the desert part of India, Rajasthan, it would settle down. That gave me the clue that it is not a question of medicines; I had to find some desert place, and big enough. For simple reasons.… If I was living in the city and at somebody's house they were having a fire or celebrating a Hindu festival with firecrackers, that was enough to trouble me. You cannot stop them just for my allergy. So I needed a big place, and this place is big enough. It is 126 square miles.\nMy sannyasins know what my troubles are, so they don't do anything that can trouble me. And the climate is dry. I had never come here with the intention to stay. I came only so that I could get healthier, and I have been getting healthier. I am far better than I was there, but my troubles are such that they can be triggered any moment. You just come here and you have been smoking, that is enough. You are not smoking here, just talking, and if I get the smell of tobacco, you have done it.\nSo it has become a problem. My Indian commune is there. They are waiting for me; but I know that if I go back the same problem will arise again. I was 180 pounds when I came; now I am 132 pounds. Just the dry climate helped me to reduce the weight without any difficulty.\nSo I am going to be here. And I am not a person to just sit and watch whatsoever goes on, because I don't think America belongs only to Americans and India belongs only to Indians. This whole earth belongs to us. I am feeling perfectly good here, healthwise, so I am not going to leave.\nSecondly, I am feeling immensely interested by the hostility of Oregonians. For thirty years in India I had been hammering people. By and by they became accustomed to me, to my criticism. These people are new and they are really getting disturbed, and I am getting great joy out of it!\nQ: YOU APPARENTLY ARE THE HEAD OF A VERY RICH WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION. WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON ANY OBLIGATION YOU MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD CHARITY? TO THE FAMINE\nCOUNTRIES? TO POVERTY IN INDIA? TO THE MANY OTHER PLACES THAT NEED HELP?\nA: First, I am not the head of a worldwide organization. I am not even a sannyasin. Nothing is in my hands; it is my sannyasins' business. I am simly a guest.\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FEELING ABOUT IT THEN?\nA: My personal feeling is that there should be no more preparation for future war. And all the nations who are putting seventy-five percent of their energy and income into making new weapons, should move all that energy to help those who need it. I don't have anything to give to Ethiopia, because I don't possess anything.\nQ: DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WISHED TO HELP ETHIOPIA, YOUR SANNYASINS WOULD COMPLY WITH YOUR WISHES AND RENDER HELP?\nA: No. I would not wish it either. This should be the work of the politicians and the religious leaders. They should take the responsibility -- I have nothing to do with it. In fact, if people had listened to me, India would not have been poor. For thirty years I was saying to them, \"Go for birth control. Abortion should be made legal\" -- and I was condemned for that. They were throwing stones and shoes and knives at me for teaching them immorality.\nSo I don't feel responsible if they are starving. It is their doing. Anybody who is dying and starving should remember that the whole crime is due to people like the pope, Mother Teresa, and other religious leaders who are against birth control, against abortion. They are increasing the population of the world, and they are getting Nobel prizes. Mother Teresa should be hanged!\nQ: WELL, EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE WORLD HUNGER IS A RESULT OF MISGUIDED POLICIES ON THE PART OF WORLD LEADERS, WHAT ABOUT HUMAN COMPASSION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STARVING? -- SIMPLE HUMAN COMPASSION.\nA: If you really want to know the truth, I say just send medical groups to help the Ethiopians die peacefully if you cannot provide food and clothes. And how long are you going to provide? Ethiopia has been starving and dying for four years continuously, and those dying Ethiopians are still creating children.\nThe people who have increased the population of the world by their teachings should take the responsibility and feed those people; or, if they are incapable, my suggestion is that rather than starving, suffering, dying, it is better to give them\nan injection so they can go peacefully into eternal sleep. And I know the soul never dies, so I am not worried about anything. They will be incarnated somewhere else, and next time they will find something better than Ethiopia.\nQ: YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION, THEN?\nA: I know. I don't believe.\nQ: WOULD THAT BE PART OF YOUR INDIAN HERITAGE, SINCE IT IS A STRONG BELIEF AMONG INDIANS?\nA: No. It is not because they believe. I have tried to find it. It is not my belief, I never accept any belief. It only covers your ignorance, it never makes you wise. I have meditated; I have come to a point where I can see my own past lives, and that's proof enough. It is my knowing, my experiencing; it is nothing to do with Indian heritage, beliefs, or anything. I speak on my own authority.\nQ: YOU'VE OFTEN EXPRESSED A VIEW OF A COMING WORLD APOCALYPSE IF MAN DOESN'T CHANGE HIS OUTLOOK. IS THAT VIEW OF AN APOCALYPSE SOMETHING THAT'S RATIONALIZED FROM AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORY AND CURRENT EVENTS, OR IS IT A VISION?\nA: It is an analysis of man's whole past. The way man has been functioning -- continuously unconscious, fighting, violent -- one day it will come to its ultimate logical conclusion. And it is coming. After the second world war, you cannot have the first world war -- you can only have a third world war. It is not a vision, I am not a visionary. I can calculate the way nuclear weapons are growing. In 1945 the first atom bomb was used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Within just forty years our power of destruction is seven hundred times more, and it is growing every day.\nQ: YOU WOULD CALL YOURSELF A RATIONALIST ABOUT THIS, THEN?\nA: Absolutely.\nQ: AND YOUR ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS A WORLD EPIDEMIC OF SOME DISEASE -- POSSIBLY AIDS, I BELIEVE YOU SAID.\nA: Yes. It is also part of all that man has done to nature, to man, to animals, to everything. He has created the situation.\nFor example, in my childhood in India -- and it is not long, just fifty years ago -- the seasons used to come exactly the same day each year. India has three clear- cut seasons. Every year winter starts at the same time, disappears at the same\ntime. Since 1945 it has not been so. Now the seasons are not predictable. Some great disturbance has shaken the routine of millions of years. The water is polluted, the air is polluted; it is really a miracle that we are still surviving. So it is simply a rational analysis that if we don't change human consciousness by the end of this century, the chapter of life on this earth closes forever.\nQ: I BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE ALSO PREDICTED A TERRIBLE FLOOD. WHAT REASONS DO YOU SEE FOR THAT?\nA: That, too.… All around the world even poor and small nations are experimenting with atomic energy, even India. People are starving, dying, and India is exporting its wheat -- for what? Your people are dying. They have been producing the wheat, they will not get even one meal a day, and you are exporting wheat. Naturally, the government will have to impose an emergency, because how long can people tolerate that they are dying and their food is being exported? But India is exporting because money is needed for more nuclear plants, atomic bombs. All that India has is farming. Eighty percent of Indians are farmers; they can only sell their raw product. And they will be purchasing death. So if great explosions go on happening, it is scientifically estimated how many explosions will start melting the eternal snow of the Himalayas. And even just the Himalayas melting is enough to drown India completely, because the height of the ocean will rise fifty feet, and cities like Bombay will have no future. And this is only about the Himalayan ice. If the ice of the north pole and the south pole starts getting heated and they start melting, then you can understand.…\nIt is a man-made calamity. And there is still time to stop, because it has not happened yet. I am not a prophet in the sense that I am a visionary. I don't support all that rubbish.\nQ: YOU DO HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS, THOUGH. IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: I don't have any faith in him. The fact is that the man was crazy, and what he has written can be interpreted in any way you want. I found this rational analysis and managed to look into Nostradamus, and found similarities, which was very easy. There are many books of that kind in the world.\nIn India there is an ancient scripture thought to be written by Vyasa himself, five thousand years ago. Everything about you is written in it. You just have to go to the priest, you have to give your name, your birth time, your birth chart, and he will figure it out and find the right page where Vyasa has described you. And it is possible because in the Sanskrit language, each word has at least one dozen meanings. So looking at you, watching you, talking with you, the scholar will figure it out, and he will start reading from the scripture. And he will be very much correct.\nCopies of the scripture exist all over India; so you have it done in Delhi but if you are not satisfied -- who knows if it is right or wrong? -- you can go to Madras or Calcutta, and they will find the same page again. And because in the process of finding the page the clue is given by you, you can just change your name. Go to\nDelhi, tell one name, one date of birth; in Madras, tell another name, another time of birth and you will know what is going on. He will not be able to find the same page. He will find some other page. But ordinarily, the type of people who go will not do this. They are immensely impressed.\nNostradamus can be interpreted in any way you want. The sentences are not clear, the grammar is not correct. The words are such that you can fit them into any context you want.\nQ: BUT HAVEN'T YOU USED HIM AS THE SOURCE OF THE PREDICTION THAT THIS DREAD DISEASE WOULD SWEEP THE EARTH?\nA: No. I use all kinds of devices. If people are foolish, I can use even their foolishness to raise their consciousness. I don't feel any problem in it. If I was predicting on my own they would not listen to it, so I drag in Nostradamus. And that's what I have been doing my whole life. If I speak to Christians -- I have been speaking to Christians in India; they have the biggest theological college in Jabalpur where I was for twenty years -- and I was speaking on Jesus, I was simply speaking on myself. Just here and there I would have to put Jesus' name, and they were immensely happy; not only happy, they said, 'We have never heard any Christian, any theologian, finding the true meaning of Jesus.\" I said, \"Yes, how can they find the true meaning of Jesus?\"\nQ: YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD, IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: I don't believe in anything. Belief is simply not part of my vocabulary. Belief simply means you don't know, yet you believe. A blind man believing in light -- what can that belief do? He does not need a prophet, a messiah; he needs medicine, a surgeon, perhaps an operation on his eyes, so that he can see.\nAnd do you believe in light? Nobody asks such questions -- you know light is there. The question of belief is asked only when the thing is non-existential. You cannot see it, you cannot touch it, you cannot feel it. God is a belief, heaven is a belief, hell is a belief The reason why you believe in these things is within your psychology; the priest is only exploiting. You have greed for immortality, you have greed for paradise and all the pleasures there. You have fear of death, you have fear of falling into the darkness of hell and all the tortures there. Naturally you start believing, because you don't want to go to hell, you want to go to heaven.\nIt is because of this psychology that an idiot like Reverend Jim Jones managed the suicide of his whole commune. He persuaded them to die with him, because if they died with him, they would all enter into heaven. This is the logical conclusion of Jesus' telling his disciples, 'I will take you into heaven.\" Jim Jones went a little farther. He was really a great Christian! -- after Jesus only he is the prophet.\nQ: SO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF GOD EXISTED, GOD WOULD REVEAL HIMSELF IN SOME TANGIBLE WAY?\nA: There is no God, and there is no question of his revelation. I don't see any possibility of God's existence. I can understand the existence of consciousness, because it is within me and I can experience it. And in my silent moments of awareness, I have never come across any God, any hell, any heaven.\nQ: IS RAJNEESHISM A RELIGION?\nA: No. It is a religionless religion. It is simply religiousness. Q: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A PROPHET?\nA: No. I am not so stupid. I don't consider myself in any way special, extraordinary, a messenger of God, a prophet, a messiah. No. I am just an ordinary human being like you and everybody else.\nQ: I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR ULTIMATE AIMS HERE IN OREGON?\nA: I never think of tomorrow... and you are asking about the ultimate aim!\nQ: WELL, SIR, I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME COME HERE TO VISIT YOU.\nA: I loved it.\nQ: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE, AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.…\nA: Whenever you feel like coming, come. Q: THANKS VERY MUCH.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #13 Chapter title: America Is A Hypocrite 30 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 24.]\nLaura Parker\nPOST INTELLIGENCER SEATTLE, WASHINGTON\nQUESTION: HELLO. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS WRITE A STORY PROFILING YOU. THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF READERS IN THE SEATTLE AREA WHO ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMUNE OR WITH YOU AS THE NEWSPAPER READERS ARE IN OREGON, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT RAJNEESHISM. I GUESS WE COULD START WITH: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK, AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK TO REPORTERS?\nANSWER: I have never asked any \"why\" in my life. I simply do anything that I feel like doing. I am not a man of thinking. I function through my feelings. If I feel to stop speaking, I can stop in the middle of a sentence, I will not even complete the sentence. And if I want to speak, even from my grave I will continue.\nQ: I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THAT.…\nA: Even from my grave, I will continue to speak.\nQ: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THE MEDIA THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY THROUGH YOUR DISCOURSES OR BOOKS? DO THE REPORTERS CARRY A MESSAGE TO THE AUDIENCE IN AMERICA FOR YOU?\nA: Certainly. Whatever I can say to my people, I say to them; but that is not going to reach to the people outside the commune. I would like them to be acquainted with what is happening here, and not to depend on rumors. I would like to invite them to be our guests, see our people, and see that there is a different way of life, too.\nQ: IS THERE ANY WAY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT COME HERE COULD UNDERSTAND THIS WAY OF LIFE?\nA: It is almost impossible, because there are things which can only be experienced and cannot be explained. In fact, if you try to explain them, you explain them away.\nQ: IS THERE ANY WAY THE PEOPLE IN OREGON. WILL THERE EVER BE\nPEACE HERE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN OREGON WHO ARE SO OPPOSED TO THE RAJNEESHEES, AND THE COMMUNE HERE OR THE RANCH HERE? DO YOU SEE THAT EVER HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE?\nA: I don't think of the future at all. Right now we are enjoying their opposition, their hostility, because this is the beginning of friendship. If they had ignored us, then I would have had to think of something.…\nQ: COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE? IF THEY HAD IGNORED YOU, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, THEN, THE HOSTILITY?\nA: No. I would have created something so that they could not ignore. I can accept their hate, their hostility, their opposition; but I cannot accept their ignoring us, because it is easier to transform the hate into love, hostility into friendship. But there is no way to communicate with someone who is ignoring you. The people of Oregon have proved really receptive.\nQ: IF WE COULD GO BACK TO INDIA, AND WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.… I HAVE READ SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, BUT I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT. COULD YOU TELL ME I\nHAVE HEARD THAT YOU LIVED WITH SHEELA'S FAMILY FOR A WHILE, AND I HAVE READ THAT YOU LIVED WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS AS A YOUNG BOY. I'M NOT CERTAIN WHICH IS ACCURATE. COULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD?\nA: Yes. My early childhood, up to six or seven, I was with my maternal grandfather and grandmother. I loved the place. It was a very small village surrounded by lush greenery and the house of my grandfather was just on the bank of a beautiful lake. After that, for three years I lived with Sheela's father. He loved me not like a small boy, but just like a contemporary friend.\nIt was a strange relationship -- he loved me, he respected me, too, which is very rare. I loved him, that was nothing new; I respected him, but I respected him more because he could respect a child just like a friend. And for three years it\nwas a tremendous experience, because I could never communicate or relate with my own age group. I had never played any game in my life. It all looked stupid.\nQ: EVEN AS A VERY SMALL CHILD?\nA: Never. As far back as I can remember, I loved only one game -- to argue. Q: TO ARGUE?\nA: To argue... about everything. So very few grownup people could stand me. Understanding was out of the question. In Sheela's father, I found a man who was ready to understand me, and I never felt that he was tired or bored or not ready to answer. He never tried to shut me up. He never told me a single time, \"These things you will understand only when you are grown up.\" If he did not know something, he accepted it: I don't know it, I am searching as you are searching. If in argument he could not convince me, and my argument was weightier than his, he was able to accept it without feeling insulted, humiliated. He is a man of tremendous understanding, caring, and our relationship has remained the same. Now he is my sannyasin.\nQ: THIS WAS WHEN YOU WERE TEN YOU LIVED WITH HIM, APPROXIMATELY?\nA: It must have been nearabout... between six to nine.\nQ: DID HE SEND YOU TO SCHOOL? WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING YOU?\nA: No. Because I was never interested in going to school. That was the worst place. I was forced finally to go, but I resisted as much as I could, because there were only children who were not interested in things I was interested in and I was not interested in things they all were interested in. So I was an outsider.\nQ: WHAT WERE YOU INTERESTED IN?\nA: My interest has remained the same: to know what is the ultimate truth, what is the meaning of life, why I am here and not anyone else. And I was determined that unless I find the answer, I am not going to rest, and I am not going to let anybody around me rest, either.\nSo he was teaching me at home, because he loved me; if I did not want to go to school, then he would teach me at home. After living with him for three years, finally I had to go back to my house, because he -- Sheela's father -- left for England for his further studies.\nQ: YOUR FATHER WAS A MERCHANT, IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: He was a cloth merchant, and that's how he came in contact with Sheela's father. Sheela's father lived in Bombay, and my father used to come to Bombay for his business. And they immediately became almost like twins.\nQ: WHEN YOU WENT TO SCHOOL, YOU WERE OLDER?\nA: I was older than any child.\nQ: HOW DID THE OTHER CHILDREN IN SCHOOL TREAT YOU?\nA: Then they were afraid of me.\nQ: THEY WERE AFRAID OF YOU?\nA: They were afraid... and since then everybody is afraid. The students were afraid, the teachers were afraid.…\nQ: BECAUSE OF THE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING, OR BECAUSE OF YOUR ARGUING?\nA: My argument was their greatest problem. They never accepted any argument from children.\nQ: THEN YOU WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: Later on I was in the university, but.…\nQ: WHY DID YOU CONTINUE IN SCHOOL AND GO THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU DIDN'T...?\nA: I wanted to fight with everyone... from the primary school to the university. And I wanted to know if all these knowledgeable people have something in them, or it is all borrowed. And I found that all they had was borrowed: not a single teacher or professor had any experience of his own.\nQ: WHEN YOU WERE STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY, WAS THERE ANYONE WHO YOU READ, OR ANYONE WHO YOU FOLLOWED? -- I DON'T MEAN A TEACHER, BUT PERHAPS SOMEONE WHOSE WRITING THAT YOU PARTICULARLY READ?\nA: No.… I have read so much that perhaps nobody in the whole world can compete. My own personal library slowly, slowly became so big that the day I left India it had 150,000 rare books. I have read VASTLY; in fact, it is difficult to mention the name of any book that I have not read.\nQ: I THINK I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU STOPPED READING AT SOME POINT.\nA: For the past five years I have not read anything.\nQ: FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS?\nA: Not even a newspaper, no magazine, no book. I simply stopped reading because I understood that all those books are just rubbish. You can be lost in the jungle of words, but you are not going to get any truth out of those books.\nThat was the time when I started feeling to go into silence for a group of years, just to give a gap, so that the life that I had lived before silence becomes completely separated from me. It is now completely separated from me. Now whatsoever I say, I say on my own authority. I say only that which I know. I don't believe in anything. I don't quote anybody unless he coincides with me.\nQ: WHEN DID YOU MEET SHEELA?\nA: Sheela's father was not even married when I started living with him. He got married after three months. Sheela came long afterwards. But Sheela's father has been trying to bring all his children to me, he wanted them not to miss me. His two sons are sannyasins, all his daughters are sannyasins. Sheela was studying in America for about ten years before. She was not interested in any search for truth, she was not aware that there is something to seek in life.\nWhen she came to me, she was almost a TABULA RASA, a clean sheet, nothing written on her. That helped her immensely. Once she came to me, she never left. And because she was open, clean, without any prejudice, she could understand me immediately. Her understanding has not been any mental effort on her side... she simply absorbed me. She ate every word that I uttered to her.\nQ: YOU TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: Yes.\nQ: YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY? AND YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR TWENTIES?\nA: Yes.\nQ: DESCRIBE THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE A TEACHER AND WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO TEACH TO YOUR STUDENTS WHILE YOU WERE AT THE UNIVERSITY.\nA: It was a very difficult situation. I was teaching my students everything that the university prescribed, and I was also teaching them how much in this prescribed teaching is bogus and bullshit. So it was a difficult job... I was teaching Aristotle and at the same time I was teaching them that Aristotle is not right. So my period was divided in two sections: first I would teach them what Aristotle means, and then I would say that he is wrong, that as far as I am concerned Aristotle has been a great calamity for humanity.\nSo I was complained against because this was a strange way of teaching, and the students were getting confused. They used to ask me: \"What are we going to answer in the examination?\" I said that they had to choose: If you feel Aristotle is right, it is up to you; if you feel I am right, it is up to you. If you feel we both are wrong and you are right, it is up to you. Choose. And I also recommended to the vice-chancellor not to bother about these complaints, because I am giving them a challenge, and it is the challenge to the mind that sharpens it.\nQ: AND WHAT DID THE VICE-CHANCELLOR SAY TO YOU?\nA: He said to me that those students had not come to know the truth, they had come only to earn a degree. I told the vice-chancellor, \"Then accept my resignation, because I have not come here to make students clerks, teachers, station masters, postmasters... I am not interested in their degrees and examinations. My whole interest is to sharpen a student's intelligence, make him an individual, unprejudiced, open, available to reality.\" And I resigned.\nQ: AND THEY ACCEPTED YOUR RESIGNATION?\nA: They tried not to accept it. They tried to persuade me, but this is not my way. Once I have done anything I never go back. I told them, \"I can feel your concern for me, I can feel your respect and love for me, but once I have resigned, it is finished. Now I will be a wandering teacher.\"\nThen for almost twenty years I was just a wandering teacher around the country and I found that it was foolish wasting time in the university teaching twenty students. When I can teach fifty thousand people in one single meeting, what is the point of wasting time in the university? So I have not been at a loss. From the university I moved to the universe.\nQ: I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY READERS UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED WHEN YOU WERE IN YOUR VERY EARLY TWENTIES, AND THEN YOU BECAME A TEACHER AFTER THAT. IS THAT\nCORRECT? -- AND THEN TRAVELED AFTER THAT. COULD YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHEN YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, AND HOW THAT OCCURRED?\nA: Enlightenment simply means an experience of your consciousness unclouded by thoughts, emotions, sentiments. When the consciousness is totally empty, there is something like an explosion, an atomic explosion. Your whole insight becomes full of a light which has no source and no cause. And once it has happened, it remains. It never leaves you for a single moment; even when you are asleep, that light is inside. And after that moment you can see things in a totally different way. After that experience, there is no question in you.\nSo for twenty-one years I was continuously questioning people, and after that day I have been continually answering people. I don't have any questions.\nQ: WHAT WAS THAT DAY LIKE? WHAT WAS THE DAY LIKE WHEN YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED? I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS TO PEOPLE WHO, AS I SAY, ARE NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH BECOMING ENLIGHTENED.\nA: It will be difficult for them to understand. Because when that experience happens, there are no words, no thoughts; and when you want to express it, obviously words are needed, thoughts are needed.\nQ: WERE YOU A STUDENT AT THE TIME?\nA: I was a student.\nQ: DID YOU SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE?\nA: No. For seven years, I kept completely silent about it because I was waiting for somebody to recognize it -- perhaps I had gone mad, perhaps it was just insanity. I wanted somebody to recognize it, and there were a few people who started recognizing that something had happened which is rare and unique.\nThe first man to recognize was an old man who was almost silent for his whole life. Once in a while he would utter a word -- meaningless, you could not make anything out of it, but he was respected immensely. His name was Magga Baba. People used to come to him from faraway places, and he never spoke. To have a contact with that man people used to massage his feet and just sit around him. He might be sleeping and people would be sitting around him, because there was something radiating from that man, something that they could feel like a fragrance.\nThe first day I went to see him, he immediately hugged me and whispered in my ear, \"My boy, so you have got it... and it is good that you have not told anybody.\nWait for the right moment to tell, because it immediately creates opposition, antagonism, and you are too young... you may not be able to fight. So just wait a little.\"\nQ: COULD SHEELA'S FATHER TELL? A: No.\nQ: DID YOU SEE HIM AFTER YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, BUT BEFORE YOU HAD TOLD PEOPLE?\nA: Yes. The moment I met him afterwards, he immediately became a sannyasin.\nQ: YOU SAID THAT THE OTHER MAN TOLD YOU TO WAIT UNTIL THE RIGHT MOMENT. WHEN WAS THAT MOMENT? WHEN DID YOU TELL?\nA: When he told me, it must have been... I must have been twenty-eight. And once that old man had recognized it, I slowly started speaking about it. And soon I was in the world fighting, arguing against anything that prevents people from becoming enlightened.\nSo I have been fighting all the religions, all the politicians, all the educationists; and the more I have fought them, the more I have attracted intelligent people around the world towards me. My people are not like Jesus' apostles. My people are professors, engineers, doctors, writers, poets, musicians, painters, dancers. I\nhave the most talented group in the whole world.\nQ: DESCRIBE FOR ME WHEN YOU WERE TRAVELING AROUND INDIA LECTURING.… WHERE DID YOU GO, WHAT WAS THE RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM THE GROUPS. ?\nA: It was different in different places, in different groups. For example, I was lecturing in different universities in India -- and India has almost one hundred universities. The students were the ones who got the point most. I was teaching in religious conferences. The people who gathered to listen got the point, but the organizers, the religious leaders, became my enemies.\nSo any conference, any gathering of religious people I have visited only once, I was not invited there again. Just in one visit I had disturbed their people so much, stirred so many doubts and questions in their minds. Because this is one of my basic standpoints: the way to truth is not belief, but doubt; not faith, but inquiry.\nBecause of this I say religion and science start from the same point, although their directions are different. Science moves towards the objective world, but its basic foundation is doubt. Doubt everything unless you come across something\nwhich is indubitable. And religion moves inwards; but the basic point remains the same: Doubt, and go on doubting unless you come across something that even when you try to doubt it -- it is there in front of you -- all your doubts disappear.\nSo to me science and religion both meet at a certain point, the beginning. And if it is understood, it will not be difficult to help them to meet at the end, too. And it will be a great day of rejoicing when science and religion become fellow travelers.\nQ: WHEN DID YOU START THE ASHRAM IN POONA? DID THAT COME MUCH LATER?\nA: Much later in '73.\nQ: SO YOU TRAVELED AROUND INDIA FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS?\nA: Yes. I continuously went.…\nQ: WHY DID YOU STOP TRAVELING AND START THE ASHRAM?\nA: Traveling, I was trying to find people who are ready to go with me to any end. The moment I became aware that I had enough people in India, that I need not bother to go on traveling, I could now settle in one place and let people come to me.… As I became settled, Indians came... and soon people from around the world slowly, slowly started coming.\nIn Poona, there were ten thousand sannyasins living with me. It was a strange place, almost like an island; ten thousand people of different nations, races, colors, languages, and Indians themselves became a minority group. The moment they saw that what I am teaching and saying is not propagating Hinduism, I am not propagating anybody's religion, I have got my own experience. The Hindu mind is the oldest mind and the most rotten, of course;\nit is so full of conditionings. When the people from the West came to me they were less conditioned -- particularly the young people. To have a communion with them was far more easy.\nSo I don't see any difference between Poona and Rajneeshpuram. In Poona, I was among non-Indians; in Rajneeshpuram, I am among non-Indians.\nQ: WAS THE ASHRAM LARGE ENOUGH? OR DID YOU WANT TO EXPAND AT THAT POINT?\nA: I wanted to expand it. It was large enough, but not large enough for the people who were going on coming. There were two thousand sannyasins living in the ashram itself, and the remaining eight thousand were living in hotels, guest houses, in other people's houses. The whole of Poona was overflooded\nwith sannyasins, and I wanted all of them to live together because they had been continuously cheated by people.\nIndians proclaim themselves very religious That is just nonsense; they are the\nmost materialist people on the earth. Rents went ten times higher as soon as they saw many foreigners coming. Prices of everything went high. In the market, if an Indian was purchasing a thing there was a different price; and if a sannyasin, a foreigner, was purchasing the same thing, it was ten times more. When I had started the ashram a huge bungalow with two acres of garden around it was available at $20,000. Soon it became impossible. even $100,000 was not enough.\nPeople were asking absurd prices. Q: FOR ADDITIONAL LAND?\nA: For land, for houses, for food, for everything We were searching for land in India somewhere else; but the Maharashtra government would not allow me to leave Maharashtra. They had found a strategy to prevent me: one, that any property, any land, any house that we purchased was never allowed to be transferred into our names. Even now.…\nQ: SAY THAT AGAIN. ?\nA: Any property, any land, any house that we purchased, the Maharashtra government did not transfer it to our name.\nQ: WHY NOT?\nA: Simply so that we could not sell it. And we had invested so much money there that unless we could sell, it was difficult for us to move. So this was their one strategy. Now, even now, those properties are not in the name of the commune -- because still the commune exists there. And the second strategy was they were forcing the central government that we should not be allowed land anywhere else. The reason was that they were earning so much out of the visitors, Poona became the biggest tourist place in the whole of India. The people who now have gone to Poona say it looks a deserted place: hotels are empty, houses are empty, prices have fallen.\nAnd you will be surprised to know that the people who were against me had arranged a Hindu ritual -- a fire ritual, which one hundred brahmins have to perform for seven days continuously, twenty-four hours of continuous prayer to God that I should be brought back. And these were the same people who had even made an attempt on my life!\nQ: WHEN DID THEY PERFORM THIS RITUAL? RECENTLY, OR. ?\nA: Just two years ago.\nQ: HOW DID YOU GET THE FINANCING TO START THE ASHRAM IN POONA?\nA: I had so many rich friends all over the country. I don't have a single cent, and now I have people all over the world who have money and who have guts to risk that money with a dangerous man like me.\nQ: WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU TO GET ADDITIONAL LAND, IS THAT WHEN YOU MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE INDIA?\nA: No. They were not allowing for seven years, so that was not the problem. I had no intention to leave India. If they would not allow us land outside, we would have gone on purchasing more and more properties in Poona without changing it into our name. The law in India provides that if somebody has occupied a house for nine months, you cannot throw him out, so it does not matter... who cares in whose name the property is? -- we are the users. So we went on purchasing properties. Still our people are growing there.\nSince I have not been there, the opposition has died down. In fact much sympathy has arisen, so our people have purchased four hundred acres of land near Poona, and they are developing a new commune there.\nQ: DID YOU WANT TO LEAVE POONA?\nA: No. For me it makes no difference: wherever I am, I never go out. Rajneeshpuram may be in the Soviet Union, or in America or in India. It does not matter to me, I don't know who is living outside.\nQ: HOW IS RAJNEESHPURAM DIFFERENT FROM POONA, PHYSICALLY?\nA: In many ways. First, it is 126 square miles of land; the Poona ashram was only six acres of land. It differs because all the sannyasins can live together here. In Poona it was difficult, they were living in separate places. Now they have their own home, and all are living together, working together, producing, creating. The Rajneeshpuram commune is no longer dependent on anybody -- we are self- sufficient.\nRight now five thousand sannyasins are here, but it changes. People go on coming, living here for three or four months, as much as they can afford. Each thing is made by sannyasins: the food, the clothes, everything is created by sannyasins with great love.\nIn Poona it was sad -- they were cheated, exploited. They were falling sick continuously because India is dirty, the water is polluted.\nHere we have pure water, we have pure air, we don't have neighbors -- it is easy to love your enemies, but it is not easy to love your neighbors. We are alone here, in our own world, totally independent. In Poona, everything had to be done so that the old conditioned mind was not disturbed too much. Here, there is no problem. Even if people want to go to the lake and have a sunbath naked, nobody is bothered by that. If people want to dance and sing, nobody is bothered. In Poona it was a difficult problem: if people wanted to dance, then there were so many complaints from the neighbors, and soon the police were there, saying that they are disturbing the neighbors.\nNow, at last, we are not disturbing any neighbors. And those who are disturbed, they are far away. Let them boil up within themselves. Let them enjoy... if they enjoy hostility. But they don't have even the guts to come here and see. They may be just thirty miles away, but they don't have the guts to come and see. Deep down they are afraid that perhaps we are right and they are wrong. That is the threat. Anybody who has come here has gone away with a different attitude, with a new attitude about the commune.\nQ: YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED THE POONA ASHRAM TO ME AS HAVING MANY LUSH GARDENS, AND WHEN THIS RANCH WAS FIRST PURCHASED IT WAS ALMOST WORTHLESS DESERT LAND.\nA: Yes.\nQ:... WHAT DID YOU THINK, OR WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION WHEN YOU FIRST CAME AND SAW THE LAND HERE?\nA: I did not like it, because I have always liked greenery and this was a desert, so I was not impressed. I told my people that they have to change this place into an oasis, and in these four years we have done much. Just four years more, and it will not be a desert anymore. We will make it lush green.\nQ: ALL OVER? YOU WILL TURN THE WHOLE RANCH INTO AN OASIS?\nA: No. There is no need. Just Rajneeshpuram, the city. An over, I would like it as it is, as a remembrance; all over I will keep it as it is, as a remembrance of how it used to be and what we have done to it. Mountains have also their beauty, naked. The juniper -- that is the only tree around here -- has its own beauty and strength. We will make many lakes... we have already made one, one was already there. We will make many lakes, and we have created a small river just with rain water. We are growing our food, we are working in the fields, we have\nour own vegetable gardens, our own flower gardens, our own greenhouses. So whatsoever we want to do we can do.\nAnd now I can see that it was good to have a desert. It has given us a challenge, and challenge brings creativity to function. And it is far more enjoyable that all the trees and all the lakes and all the greenery have been made by us. It is our creation, it is not second-hand.\nQ: IT HAS BEEN SAID TO ME THAT YOU LEFT POONA IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. IS THIS TRUE?\nA: Certainly true!\nQ: THE IMPLICATION BEING THAT YOU SNEAKED AWAY, AS OPPOSED TO ANNOUNCING IT.…\nA: That is wrong.\nQ: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME HOW YOU LEFT POONA?\nA: I left in my Rolls Royce, and not in the dead of the night. I left Poona in the day, in the midday sun, with two Rolls Royces, three Mercedes Benz. With five cars I left in the middle of the day. I left BOMBAY at midnight, because the plane leaves at midnight. What could I do?\nQ: DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHPURAM BECOMING A CITY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE PERMANENT SANNYASIN RESIDENTS THAN THERE ARE NOW?\nA: Certainly.\nQ: IN A SELF-SUSTAINING WAY, I MEAN; A LARGER VEGETABLE FARM AND...?\nA: Yes.\nQ: HOW DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHPURAM GROWING AS A CITY? BY HUNDREDS, OR THOUSANDS, OR...?\nA: Nothing can be said about that. But it is growing, and I don't see any reason except a third world war to prevent Rajneeshpuram from growing.\nQ: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT YOUR DAY IS LIKE? GETTING BACK TO.… I'M SERVING READERS WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT...\nNONE OF WHOM, EXCEPT FOR A FEW, HAVE EVER BEEN HERE, AND THEY ARE CURIOUS ABOUT YOU.\nA: It is all over ecstasy. Q: I'M SORRY?\nA: It is all over ecstasy. I enjoy everything. I enjoy my breakfast, I enjoy my lunch, I enjoy my supper, and I enjoy my sweets before I go to sleep. Just please don't tell my physicians.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THE DAY?\nA: I am completely engaged. In the morning I speak to my sannyasins for two and a half hours. In the night I meet media people as long as they want; and after the media has left, Sheela has her work -- she is my secretary -- for one hour, two hours, as much as she needs. A few things I have absolutely private: three hours in my bathroom, one and a half hours in the morning, and one and a half hours in the evening. That's my luxury. Sometime you should come and see my bathroom.\nQ: I'LL ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION ANY TIME!\nA: Good! Because it is almost a temple to me, and my people have created such a beautiful bathroom because they knew I love big things! I have a swimming pool only for myself, olympic size. You should see my garage -- almost one hundred Rolls Royces. And my people have improved upon them.\nQ: HOW?\nA: They have painted them better. They have changed many faults that were there. Even the president of the Rolls Royce company in America was here to see, and he remarked that there is no other garage where a Rolls Royce is treated in this way. Just because I use them, my people take care of them. They have painted my Rolls Royces in psychedelic colors.\nQ: IF I COULD BACK UP FOR A MINUTE.… WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND WHEN THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TO OREGON AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED HERE, DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS OR WERE YOU SURPRISED AT THE KIND OF RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM OREGONIANS, WHO ARE AMERICANS, WHO ARE CITIZENS OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM?\nA: I was not only surprised, I was utterly disappointed, because I have always respected America. I had always thought that democracy really exists here. I have been always against the Soviet Union and its dictatorial government, but when I came here I found it is another Soviet Union -- perhaps the dictatorship is more sophisticated, the democracy only a mask -- because our people have been treated so badly, and they are continuously harassed for no reason at all. Their ways of harassment are really ugly, fascist.\nDemocracy exists only in the Constitution. Perhaps for Christians there is democracy and freedom of religion, but not for us. And I want the whole world to know that there is nothing much to choose between the Soviet Union and America, only that the Soviet Union is straightforward, frankly accepting that it is a dictatorship of the proletariat. America is a hypocrite.\nQ: CAN YOU ENVISION YOURSELF EVER RETURNING TO INDIA?\nA: No, for the simple reason that that's not my lifestyle. I never return to anything. What is past is past. I have changed places many times, in India too, but once I have left a place, I have never visited it again. So, seeing my pattern of the past, a logical conclusion is that I'm not going anywhere -- particularly because of this hostility, this hypocritical democracy I have to fight here. We are fighting in so many courts, and we will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court. Either they have to be fair with us and democratic, or we are going to expose them all over the world as another dictatorship -- not of the proletariat, but of the super-rich.\nQ: YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF, I THINK IN AN INTERVIEW, AS THE RICH MAN'S GURU.\nA: I am.\nQ: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME WHAT THAT MEANS? AND HOW THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM, SAY, A POOR MANS GURU? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A STATE OF MIND, OR A STATE OF THE POCKETBOOK? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT STATE OF MIND -- THAT THE RICH HAVE A DIFFERENT STATE OF MIND THAN THE POOR -- OR ARE YOU MERELY TALKING ABOUT ECONOMICS?\nA: I am talking in all the dimensions. A man can be reached in many ways, and economics is not excluded. He can be reached in music, he can be reached in poetry, he can be reached in wealth. All need a certain kind of intelligence to create; and when I say I am a rich man's guru, I mean I am the Master of all those who are creators in any dimension of life. Of course, the poor man cannot create,\nhe cannot even manage his physical survival. You cannot expect him to understand Van Gogh or the theory of relativity or Bertrand Russell. And if he cannot understand Bertrand Russell, he cannot understand me.\nI have doubts whether Bertrand Russell would be able to understand me or not, most probably not, because he never meditated in his whole, long life. He lived almost a century, and he went on denying the existence of God without even bothering to look into himself Not a single moment in a century-long life did he sit down and look into himself to ask if he is only a body or there is something more to it. And if the body is just the outer shell of something which is not material, that means this whole existence is full of life. Even the soul has to be in a tree, if the tree is alive.\nTo me, life is God. There is no other God than life. And to experience life, there is no other way than meditation. So, naturally, it is difficult for the poor people. You cannot hope that Ethiopians will come to meditate here; nor am I going there to teach them meditation. Their need is different. I fulfill the needs of those who are hungry for something higher than bread and butter.\nAnd you ask me what it means to be a poor man's guru. It means Mother Teresa, Pope the Polack, these are the people who are the gurus of the poor, because those poor people can be converted to Christianity very easily. Just give them a little support economically, financially; give them schools, hospitals, free food, free milk for their children. That is enough, but that is not religion. That is simply purchasing people, making them Christians on financial grounds. They are simply playing a politics of numbers. They want that poor people should go on existing, because that is from where they can get Christians.\nIn India, I have not seen a single rich man who has converted to Christianity. I have seen beggars, poor people, hungry people, dying people, sick people being converted to Christianity, but I have not seen a painter, a musician, a poet, a wealthy man turning to Christianity. In fact, exactly the opposite is happening. All the great painters of the West, all the musicians, all the dancers, all those who can think intelligently have dropped out of Christianity. With them I can have a communion -- very easily.\nThe pope cannot have a communion with Jean-Paul Sartre, it is impossible. The pope will look retarded before Jean-Paul Sartre. He will not be able even to understand what Jean-Paul Sartre is talking about: anguish, meaninglessness -- these are the poor man's guru. Up to now, the world was only divided into the poor and the rich. I have made a new division: the poor man's guru and the rich man's guru.\nQ: A FEW YEARS AGO, YOU WERE QUOTED AS SAYING THERE WAS NO SINGLE PATH, THERE WAS NO EXCLUSIVE RELIGION. YOU EMBRACED ALL FORMS OF RELIGION. AND THEN, A FEW YEARS LATER, YOU SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND WHEN YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT THAT, YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.…\nA: I am a man of contradictions, and I am proud of it! Only an idiot is always consistent. The intelligent person goes on growing, finding new ground, new spaces. And when I go on finding new groovy spaces, naturally I have to talk about them. And if they contradict my past, so what? Past is dead anyway.\nQ: I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE, AND I HAVE SEEN THE DRIVEBYS, AND I THINK I HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT SANNYASINS ARE EXPERIENCING DURING THE DRIVEBY. WHAT DO YOU EXPERIENCE INSIDE YOUR CAR WHEN YOU DRIVE PAST YOUR DISCIPLES?\nA: I love them. Just to see them is a great nourishment to me. to see them dance, to see them laugh. Perhaps I start feeling: I am certainly the Blessed One -- so much love I don't think anybody has received ever. Jesus had only twelve fools around him.\nQ: DO YOU HAVE DOUBTS THAT YOU ARE THE BLESSED ONE?\nA: Not doubts... I am a perfectly Blessed One. I was just joking a little bit.\nQ: YOU DON'T GO OUT DRIVING ANYMORE AROUND HERE, IS THAT CORRECT?\nA: Not every day now. When I was not speaking, when I was in silence, I wanted to see my sannyasins every day... that's why the driveby was invented. Now I am seeing them in the morning for two and a half hours every day, so there is no need. But we have four celebrations around the year. In each celebration -- it will be a seven day celebration -- they will have driveby also.\nQ: YOU DON'T DRIVE AROUND THE HILLS OUTSIDE RAJNEESHPURAM ANY MORE?\nA: In the beginning I used to, but the county road that connects us is exactly the road that goes to hell. So I don't go. I dropped the idea.\nQ: HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIGN AT THE LAST TURNOFF TO RAJNEESHPURAM RECENTLY? I SAW IT ON THE WAY IN TODAY: \"ABANDON YE ALL HOPE WHO ENTER HEREIN.\" HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIGN?\nA: No, because I don't go there, but I have heard about it. It is right -- because what is the need of hope here? We are eating the cake, and they are simply hoping for it.\nQ: I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION. IT'S A LITTLE FRIVOLOUS. IN ORDER\nTO GO ON DRIVING, I KNOW YOU HAD TO GET AN OREGON DRIVER'S LICENSE. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT THAT WAS LIKE, TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION WITH THE OREGON TESTER, OR THE MAN WHO GOES WITH YOU AND GIVES YOU THE DRIVING TEST? I MEAN, WHAT HE WAS LIKE WHEN HE WAS GIVING YOU THE TEST?\nA: There was really no need. The person who examined me could understand it clearly: I can drive from here to Madras, and I have an Indian license for driving, and I have an international license for driving, so he simply thought it was absolutely foolish. I could examine him! He just went around with me to show that an examination was being done -- a nice fellow.\nQ: AND ON THAT NOTE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nA: Good. I was happy!\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #14 Chapter title: The Function Of A Master 31 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 25.]\nRoberta Green\nSANTA ANA REGISTER ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA\nQUESTION: THE 'SANTA ANA REGISTER' IS IN ORANGE COUNTY, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE, I THINK. I'VE DONE MANY ARTICLES ABOUT RAJNEESHEES; I DID SOME ABOUT GEETAM ASHRAM, AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL ABOUT UTSAVA IN LAGUNA BEACH, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET THE CHANCE TO COME HERE! THAT TAKES CARE OF MY QUESTIONS!\nTHEY SAID IT WAS SAFE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS! ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE READ THAT YOU'VE SAID, AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY IT ON VIDEOTAPE, IS THAT YOU TELL A FEW JOKES TO WAKE THE WORLD UP. WHEN DID THE WORLD GO TO SLEEP? AND IS IT WAKING UP?\nANSWER: It has been always asleep. Only a few individuals in the whole history of man have been awakened. Their names can be counted on the ten fingers, not more than that.\nAnd it was natural. Man has evolved out of the animals. Animals are in a deep sleep, but they don't know that they are. That is the meaning of sleep: one is, but one is not aware that one is. No animal is aware of himself.\nI agree with Charles Darwin on different grounds. His grounds are ordinary, mundane, and can be criticized, have been criticized. In fact, he is no longer an accepted scientist about the evolution of humanity. The majority of scientists have deserted him. But I support him on a totally different ground. My ground is looking at man's sleep. This is the only possibility, that he has grown up from the animals -- monkeys, chimpanzees, whatsoever, whosoever was there in the beginning. Man's sleep proves it. And only rarely, once in a while, a Gautam Buddha, a Bodhidharma, a Socrates. Once in a while there has been a man who\nhas the guts to come out of sleep.\nIt needs tremendous courage to come out of sleep because we have so much invested in sleep. It is just like a man who is dreaming that he is living in a\ngolden palace, with a great kingdom, with all the luxuries, and you try to wake him up. He is just a beggar on the street. Only beggars dream of being emperors; emperors never dream of being emperors. That will be simply illogical. The beggar has so much investment in his sleep and his dream that he will resist being awakened in every possible way. He will get irritated, he will oppose you, \"Who are you to interfere in my life? Can't you even tolerate a man who is having a sweet dream?\" And even if you force him to be awakened, he is going to fall asleep again, because waking he is only a beggar... asleep he becomes an emperor.\nThe investment in psychological sleep is tremendous. That's why all those people\n-- Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu, Plotinus, Heraclitus have failed. They did their best; they struggled against the sleep of man, but still man is asleep, and whatever he is doing proves that he is asleep.\nThe two world wars prove that he is asleep. The coming third world war can be prevented only if we can awaken enough people so that they become infectious and go on awakening other people in a chain. And it has to be done so fast, because there is not much time. Otherwise, the sleepy people are going to destroy this earth, this life.\nPoliticians are asleep. No awakened person can become a politician for the simple reason that he cannot lie. He cannot give you promises that he knows can never be fulfilled. No awakened person will be a politician, because he has no desire for his ego to be fulfilled. There is no ego any more. Ego exists as a substitute self in sleep; the moment you are awakened, ego has no function, it is useless. You are there, now you don't need it.\nAnd the man who knows himself has no inferiority complex. Unless you are suffering from some inferiority complex, you will not be involved in any kind of leadership, political, religious, social. You don't have the base. The inferiority complex is the cause of everybody becoming ambitious. If they don't become somebody in the world, in their own eyes they have failed. They want to prove themselves: \"We are here! We have been here!\" They want their names to be recorded in history, although they know that even the greatest names in history, by and by, go on slipping from prominence, become footnotes, move into the appendix and out the door. Naturally, how many people can we go on carrying?\n-- but they want to make their names. That, too, proves something animal.\nAll the animals of the world have an instinct; scientists call it the territorial imperative. The dog pissing on the tree is simply making his signature. He is saying, \"This tree belongs to me.\" He won't allow another dog to come near. Other dogs will smell his urine and will know that this tree is not free, not available, that somebody possesses it. There are animals, particularly lions, who will go on urinating on a vast territory just so that everybody is aware that if they come there, they will be getting into danger.\nMan also works in the same way. All these nations are nothing but people pissing and making a boundary: this is America, this is Soviet Union, this is\nIndia. You can smell it is a different country, so don't enter without a visa, without a passport. Otherwise, there is no need for any nations on the earth. What is the need? Can't we all live as one humanity? It would be tremendously beautiful and tremendously beneficial... because if the whole world is one, you cannot create wars. Unless you find some planets and start creating wars with them, there is no possibility of war.\nThe only way to let war disappear is to make the world one, with a functional world government, with no political parties in the world, each individual choosing on his own, nobody propagating, nobody trying to get more votes. If we can create a functional world government which only takes care of things like railways, post office, telegraph, telephone -- things which are essential and should be taken care of by the whole commune around the earth -- seventy-five percent of all the nations' income will be freed. It is now being poured out for weapons: atom bombs, nuclear weapons and other weapons.\nPeople are dying. In Ethiopia they are dying, thousands a day. In India they are starving, and soon other countries will follow. This third world of poor countries is there because of your politicians. A man who is awake cannot be a politician. He cannot be a religious leader, either, because these are all ego claims: I am the prophet of God; I am the messiah; I am somebody special sent from God; you are just ordinary human creatures, I am divine. This is simply sickness of the mind. These people are suffering from inferiority complex and covering it by fictions.\nQ: WHO ARE YOU?\nA: I am just myself. No prophet, no messiah, no Christ. Just an ordinary human being... just like you.\nQ: WELL, NOT QUITE!\nA: That's true... not quite! You are still asleep -- but that is not much of a difference. One day I was also asleep; one day you will be able to awaken. You can wake up this moment, nobody is preventing it. So the difference is just meaningless. A person who is capable of being asleep is capable of being awake.\nQ: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS GOD? A: No.\nQ: WHAT IS WITHIN US? YOU TALK ABOUT TURNING INWARD. WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN?\nA: First, let us finish God; otherwise, he will interfere again and again. God is just a projection of the ego. As ego is false and a substitute for a true self, God is the\nego of the whole world -- a substitute self, because our egos cannot exist without support. They need universal support, and God gives immense support.\nWhen I say go inwards... you are not going to find God at all. You are going to find a pure, silent consciousness, and you are going to realize immediately that the same consciousness pervades all. I call it godliness, not God, because this is a quality. Don't give it a personality, don't confine it into a person. Let it remain free, flowing. It is more like a fragrance than like a flower. A flower can be painted, a flower can be photographed; a fragrance can only be experienced, you cannot photograph it, you cannot paint it. It is a quality far superior to the personal God. It is an impersonal consciousness, universal consciousness.\nQ: DOESN'T THAT SEEM SORT OF BORING?\nA: Boring?\nQ: YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME.\nA: Yes. To an asleep person, it is boring. The person who is asleep needs colorful dreams, changes -- every night, marriage, divorce, job change. The asleep person becomes bored very easily for the simple reason that his joy is derived from something, it is not coming from his own inner source.\nI have never been bored since I came to know myself. I have been trying in every possible way. Eating the same food for years, I don't get bored. Sleeping at the same time, waking at the same time, doing the same thing round the clock for years, I don't get bored because there is no comparison with the past, there is no comparison with the future.\nBoredom needs comparison. You have to remember that this rose is nothing new: you have seen it yesterday, you have seen it the day before yesterday. You are bored. And slowly your boredom creates a barrier between you and the rose. You cannot smell it any more, you cannot see it any more. Although you see it, you cannot see its newness, its freshness. The rose that you had seen yesterday is not the same rose. It has the same quality, the same fragrance, but it has its own individuality.\nWhen you feel a cosmic consciousness, you are not lost like a dewdrop in the ocean. For the first time your individuality is revealed to you. For the first time you know the luminous being that you always have been; that you will always be immortal, that now there is no death. There is a tremendous insight into the beauty and the grace of things, and it goes on becoming bigger and bigger, fresher and fresher. It is not that it remains the same -- the universal energy is a constant growth.\nThat's why I wanted to finish with God in the first place, because God cannot grow. Where will he grow? He is perfect. Now perfection cannot grow. He\nknows all; what more is there for him to know? He is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent... and don't you get bored with God?\nMy godliness is imperfect; it is an opening, always bigger and bigger. It is expanding, and there are no limits to its expansion. And each moment is a discovery for the awakened man. In small things -- sipping the tea in the morning,the smell of the tea.… The taste of the tea is so new, it is as new as the sun rising outside the window.\nIt depends on how conscious you are to make the world new every moment. It is already new every moment; nothing is static, everything is changing, in a flux. The tree that you had left at home, by the time you go back a few leaves may have died, the wind may have taken them. A few new leaves may have come up, a few flowers may have fallen to the ground, a few new buds may have opened. It is only to a sleeping man that the tree is the same. To the awakened man, it is new every moment.\nHeraclitus said, \"You cannot step in the same river twice.\" And I say to you that you cannot step even once in the same river, because while your feet touch the surface of the river, it is flowing. Your feet go into the river, and it is flowing. By the time your feet have touched the bottom, it is not the same river you touched on the surface.\nHeraclitus is wrong. Many people have said Heraclitus is wrong, that the world is permanent. I say it from a totally different direction -- and I know Heraclitus will have to agree with me, because I am not contradicting his basic standpoint, I am refining\nWhen he says you cannot step twice, he is trying to say that everything is changing, the wife is not the same, the husband is not the same. If people are awake, I don't think there will be so much despair, gloom, grumpiness, so many complaints about everything. The husband is bored because it is the same wife, the same geography he has to explore every day. The wife is also bored; the moment the husband starts making an approach, immediately she has a heart attack, a headache, anything will do, but somehow...\"at least one holiday. Just go to sleep silently. Don't disturb me.\" And this is the same woman who had been dreaming about this man one day, writing beautiful poems and letters to him -- and this is the same man.\nWhat has happened? What went wrong? Why are they thinking to divorce each other? They have become bored, and they think that the other is responsible for the boredom. My point is that your sleep is responsible for all boredom. No divorce is going to help. The other person will bore you just the same.\nQ: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WAKE SOMEONE UP?\nA: It needs people who can shock you. Your sleep is deep; it is no ordinary sleep, it is spiritual sleep. You need people who can shock you and break all your shock\nabsorbers. Every person has grown buffers around his sleep. Even if a shock is given, the buffers absorb it. It never reaches to the person.\nThe real function of a religious man is to teach how to break the buffers, how to come out of the shell of darkness in which you have been living for many lives. No prayer is going to help. Only a Master can help you -- and by a Master I mean a craftsman who has broken his own buffers, who has somehow sneaked out of the shell of sleep. That is the function of a Master. But all the so-called religious leaders go on putting more buffers on you.\nQ: I JUST SPENT TWO WEEKS COVERING BILLY GRAHAM, WHO IS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST EVANGELIST.\nA: I know him.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM?\nA: Just worthless, and dangerous to people's spirituality, because these people like Billy Graham, who are helping people, comforting people, consoling people, are making their buffers thicker and thicker. These are not the people who shock you. You need a Gurdjieff, you need a Krishnamurti, not Billy Graham. Billy Graham is simply a good salesman amongst sleepers. And, of course, sleepers will be very much impressed. This man is giving them what they want.\nWhen you come to a person like Gurdjieff, he is not going to give you what you want, he is going to give you what really is your need, because the wanting comes from your sleep, and your need comes from your real being. So, a man like Gurdjieff will not have gatherings like Billy Graham. He will shock you so much that you will never come near him again. Billy Graham is good entertainment, with nothing spiritual in it.\nQ: WELL, RAJNEESHEES LOVE YOU. ARE YOU GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANT?\nA: No. NEVER! I am giving them what they need. Q: THEN WHY ARE THEY STILL HERE?\nA: Because they have started loving the shocks that I give them. Q: DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY ARE AWAKE?\nA: Getting.… Taking time.… Turning this side and that side, pulling up the blanket, but I am after them! No blanket can help, no tossing and turning can\nhelp. I will do everything to force them to jump out of the bed. And I have all kinds of devices so they cannot sleep.\nQ: LIKE WHAT?\nA: Like my methods of meditation. You have to breathe so heavily for ten minutes that not only will you start awakening, but somebody else sitting near by will start wondering what is happening. In the dynamic meditation, they have to scream for ten minutes. Whatsoever it feels like: shouting, roaring, screaming. These are methods to break their buffers.\nI have lived in many cities and finally I decided that I cannot live in a city. It is impossible, because every day the neighbors were complaining to the police that they cannot sleep in the morning: \"This man gathers people who scream and jump and dance and sing and do all kinds of crazy things. And we are tired and we want to sleep. Even on Sunday morning, these people won't leave you alone. Just at five o'clock they start. \"\nI have 112 methods of hitting you. If one misses, another will do. Q: DO YOU ONLY HIT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HIT?\nA: Certainly. I never hit anybody who does not want to be hit. That's why I never go anywhere. You have to come to me, because otherwise that is against the freedom of the individual. If he wants to sleep, it is his decision, and he is completely free to sleep. If he wants to hang around Billy Graham, who am I to create any disturbance and tell him that he is hanging around an idiot?\nQ: WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFRAID OF YOU?\nA: Just because of the way I hit and shake and wake you. They don't want to wake up, they want to go on sleeping. They really want only consolations, not revolutions in their lives. They want to be consoled, \"Don't be worried, Jesus Christ will take care of you. Just have faith in Jesus Christ, and that's enough. Don't be worried. Have faith and you will be saved -- he is the savior.\"\nThis is a consolation. You start feeling you have to do nothing, only at the most go to the church on Sunday morning and have faith in Jesus Christ, which costs nothing. Yes, one day it used to cost. That time it was significant.\nQ: WOULDN'T JESUS BE PRETTY UPSET WITH THE SCENE THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING? I MEAN, HE SAID THINGS LIKE, \"TAKE UP YOUR CROSS, \" AND \"LOSE YOUR LIFE TO FIND IT, \" WHICH ISN'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nA: Jesus is two thousand years old. Don't compare a bullock cart with a Rolls Royce. They both do the same work, but please don't compare.\nQ: SPEAKING OF ROLLS ROYCES, TWO QUESTIONS. ONE IS, WHY ROLLS ROYCES AND NOT FERRARIS? AND THE OTHER IS, WHAT DOES WAKING UP HAVE TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD? I READ ALL THESE WIRE STORIES THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY ASKED YOU IF YOU'RE THE GURU TO THE RICH. AND THERE ARE ALL THESE ROLLS ROYCES AND THERE'S ALL THIS MONEY, ALL THIS STUFF... THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, AND IT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T COME FROM NOWHERE. WHAT DOES WAKING UP HAVE TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD?\nA: That, too, is giving a shock to the whole world. I can manage even with the oldest model of Ford -- the same model in which God drove Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden -- but that will not shock anybody, not even the Oregonians. Even they have better four-wheelers. All my efforts are to shock people. My ninety Rolls Royces have shocked millions of people around the earth. Can you see the joke? And I am going to make them 365, one for every day. That will give heart attacks to many people -- but I wonder what it has to do with them. It has nothing to do with them, but they are certainly shocked.\nQ: WHY DO YOU CARE?\nA: I care out of my compassion. It comes with the cosmic consciousness itself. It is a quality of cosmic consciousness; you cannot separate it.\nQ: A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD COMING TO AN END -- EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND WARS AND THINGS. IS THAT STILL HAPPENING? DO YOU STILL SEE THAT COMING TO HAPPEN?\nA: I will go on saying yes, it is going to happen, because if it is emphasized continuously that it is going to happen, it can be prevented from happening. If the whole world becomes alert that it is coming close, something has to be done to prevent it.\nPoliticians go on saying, \"Don't be worried, nothing is going to happen.\" It is the same as they were saying before the second world war, before the first world war: \"Don't be worried, we will take care; and God is with us.\"\nThe third world war can happen only if people are not alerted beforehand. If people are alerted in every country, in America and Soviet Russia, then these same people will hang their politicians rather than have a third world war. This will be far better, when I see the president of America hanging from the tree, and by his side the Soviet prime minister and the queen of England.… Just hang all\nthese people on one tree, make it a great memorial, and be finished with the third world war.\nI have been saying those things because they are possible; but if you say to people that they are only possible, then they think there is nothing to be worried about, it is only a possibility, far away. People don't see that far ahead; they don't have that farsightedness. They are too much occupied in their day-to-day affairs. They have to be hammered continuously to realize that the war is coming closer, that the holocaust is coming closer and something has to be done to prevent it.\nMy prediction is not the prediction of an astrologer. I don't mean that it is bound to happen, that it is destined to happen, no; I am not an astrologer. My prediction comes from a man who wants that it should not happen. And the only way is to emphasize that it is going to happen -- it is almost certain -- unless you wake up.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ODDS ARE?\nA: Not much. I am here. My people are around the world. We are going to make a great fuss. And we are not going to pray to God -- that I can leave to Billy Graham -- God has never helped.\nFor five thousand years the wars have been continuing, and in every war God has been asked to help. And sometimes it is very hilarious: the Germans were asking the Christian God to help them; the English were asking the same Christian God to help them, the French were asking the same Christian God to help them, the Americans were asking the same Christian God to help them, Mussolini was asking the same Christian God to help him.\nI have heard a story that after the war ended, one German general was staying with an English friend. Just at the tea table the talk drifted towards the second world war. The German said, \"I have always wondered what went wrong. We were strong, we had a rare leader, we had unity, we had a strong nation. What went wrong?\"\nThe Englishman said, \"Perhaps you forgot to pray to God.\" The German said, \"No! We were praying to God every day. All our armies were praying to God every day.\" The Englishman laughed and said, \"Then I know what is wrong. You must be praying in German, and God understands only English! Next time, don't do that... pray in English, and then see.\"\nWe are not going to pray. There is nobody to whom prayers can be addressed. But we can create a great fuss among the masses around the world. And we are going to, if the moment comes. Right now I am gathering my people and they are coming in thousands every day. Around the world I have communes just like this. Even in the Soviet Union I have my sannyasins. Of course, they have to be underground there, they have to meet in basements.\nThe Soviet government is already persecuting my sannyasins, although they are not wearing the red clothes, not wearing the mala, so there is no reason for them to find out. But even if somebody has one of my books, that's enough; or\nsomebody has my picture in his house, that's enough. One person is caught, and they persecute the person, they harass the person to the point that he has to give addresses of others, other contacts. But, strangely enough, the more they are persecuting, the more new young people are becoming sannyasins in the Soviet Union itself.\nWe will create as much disturbance as possible to prevent the third world war, because it is not only a question of some nation being victorious and some other nation being defeated. If it was only that, I would not have cared. It is a question that nobody will be victorious, nobody will be defeated, and all life will disappear from this beautiful planet.\nQ: IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TALK TO THE PRESS, AND ALSO TO START TALKING AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S SOMEHOW THE MOMENT?\nA: Certainly! That is one of the most important reasons I have started to talk to the press. I want the word to be spread through all possible media. And I don't belong to the past and past methods; I am a contemporary man -- perhaps belonging to the twenty-first century. I will use every way of approach ing people in as many directions as possible, because we don't have much time. The decisive moment will come by the end of this century.\nIn the coming fifteen years, the nuclear weapons will have piled up so much that the politicians will be under a great pressure -- what to do now? Except a nuclear war, they will not be able to see any other possibility. Already so many nuclear, atomic and other weapons exist on the earth that they can destroy this earth seven times. They can kill each person seven times. And the poor people in the world are not Jesus Christ that they will be resurrected. Once dead, they will remain dead.\nEven Jesus Christ was never resurrected. It is a fiction. Once a man dies, he dies. Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, that is true, because he was brought down from the cross within six hours, and to die on the Jewish cross in those days a person needed to hang at least forty-eight hours. Because the blood would ooze slowly out of his hands and legs, it took twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Jesus was brought down after six hours... and then he disappeared from the cave. This was a simple conspiracy between a rich disciple of Jesus' and Pontius Pilate.\nJesus escaped from Israel, and died in India, in Kashmir. I have been to his grave. His grave is there. It is a strange coincidence that Moses also died in Kashmir, not in Israel. When they found Israel, Moses was already out of date. It took forty years for him to find a third-rate place like Israel. In forty years, almost all his contemporaries were gone -- it was a tedious journey, hungry, thirsty -- only one- third of the original people remained.\nMeanwhile, children were being born, and by the time he reached Israel, he could not feel any connection with his own people. The first generation gap was\nfelt by Moses. A new generation had come which had no idea of Egypt, of their slavery. That all looked like mythology. He found a way out because one of the tribes of the Jews was lost somewhere on the journey. It was just an excuse, \"Now that we have found the holy land, you settle and I will go in search of the lost tribe\" -- and that tribe had reached Kashmir.\nKashmir is completely Jewish, although there are no Jews. They have all been forced to become Mohammedans, but you can see from their noses that they are nobody else than Jews. Moses died in Kashmir. He must have been ancient by the time he reached Kashmir. His grave is there; Jesus' grave is there. Jesus lived long in India. When he was crucified, he was only thirty-three, and he died at the very ripe age of 112. That is inscribed in Hebrew on his grave, but in India nobody knows Hebrew.\nThese are the only two graves in which the head of the dead person is not pointed towards Mecca. The other graves are Mohammedan. When Mohammedans make a grave, the head has to be pointed in the direction of Mecca. If the feet are put towards Mecca, it is a great sin. So all the graves are directed towards Mecca; only these two graves are not.\nAnd both the graves have Hebrew inscriptions. Of course, Jesus' grave is not inscribed JESUS CHRIST, because that is a Greek translation of the Hebrew, JOSHUA, THE MESSIAH. Messiah means Christ, in Greek, and Joshua got changed to Jesus in Greek. On the grave it is absolutely clear, but Christians are not interested.\nI talked with prominent Christians -- I talked one time with Stanley Jones, a world famous Christian theologian -- but they were not ready even to go there. I said, \"On my expense you come with me and I will show you the grave of Jesus.\" And it is strange that Christians are taking no interest in it -- but if it is proved that this is the real grave of Jesus Christ, then there will be trouble. Their whole Bible will be upset.\nQ: THIS MORNING IN DISCOURSE YOU SAID THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS A SLAVE IS A SLAVE TO THAT SLAVE. AND I WONDER, WATCHING THE TWO MEN WITH GUNS AND READING ABOUT THE THREATS ON YOUR LIFE AND THE THREATS ON THIS COMMUNITY, WHAT PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF HARM ARE ENSLAVED TO? AND I WONDER IF YOU'RE AFRAID?\nA: I am not afraid; otherwise, I would be carrying the gun. But the people who love me are concerned, and I don't prevent anybody. I don't prevent any assassin even. If he comes I will say, \"Hi! Do your job the best you can.\" I will not prevent him, so why should I prevent my people if they want guards? Let them have them. Those guns in a nuclear age are only toys; they mean nothing. Why should I prevent them? They are not carrying nuclear missiles on each side, just toy guns.\nI respect their love. Whatsoever those people can do they are ready to do it. It is out of respect for their love that I don't object to those guns, and I know that those guns mean nothing. In this world a bomb can just be thrown on this small commune, and you can create an American Hiroshima. What will those guns do? And it will be good that America also has one Hiroshima, otherwise you are missing something. Japan has two, Hiroshima and Nagasaki; you should at least have one. And my commune is here, available.\nI don't object to their guns. They have not done any harm to anybody in four years, and they are not going to do any harm to anybody. Perhaps this is the only place in the whole world where there is no crime, no fighting, no theft, no rape, no murder, no suicide. We have the police sitting uselessly. I have my guards, but they must be getting bored with their guns. I don't think they will have any chance to use them, but my people are concerned. I respect their love for me, and if they want to do some small things, let them.\nQ: COULD WE TALK ABOUT SEX? WHAT PLACE DOES IT HAVE IN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS?\nA: I don't have any relationship with human beings. Q: THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED, ALTHOUGH.…\nA:... And that is not what I have answered. I know what you have asked. First, get over your nervousness.\nQ: I THOUGHT IT WAS GONE.\nA: No. It happens to every journalist, so don't be worried. I love mankind, but the way they are, they need immense changes. Because I propose those changes, they become hostile. They think I am taking away very precious things from them. I am taking away only their chains, but they have been in those chains for centuries. They have already accepted them as ornaments, so my compassion and my love and my concern only create hostility in them.\nIn the French Revolution it happened that there was in France a castle, Bastille, where they used to imprison people who were sentenced to remain in prison till they die. Their hands and legs were chained with heavy chains, and they were put in dark cells with no light. Even in the day it was night.\nWhen the French Revolution happened the revolutionaries thought that those people should be freed. They went to free them, but those people fought against the revolutionaries, saying, \"We don't want to go out of the prison. We are comfortable here, and now to get into the world again, to think of earning your bread again.… We have been here for forty years and may be living just a few years more. At this stage we are not in a position to come out. In fact, even the\nsun makes us afraid. We have lived these forty years in darkness. Have mercy on us. Just leave us where we are.\"\nBut revolutionaries are always fanatic people. They forced them, they threw them out of the castle and took away their chains. You will not believe it, but half of those prisoners returned to their cells in the night and asked the revolutionaries who were holding the castle, \"Please, chain us again. We miss our chains. That weight has become part of us. We cannot sleep. If we do not feel the chains, we cannot sleep\"\nThat is the situation of humanity, so many chains: God, heaven, hell, Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, communist. All kinds of chains are there -- political, social, psychological, spiritual -- and I am speaking against them all. I want to cut them.\nNaturally, they feel offended. They cannot understand me, but I can understand them. I'm not hostile towards them; they are hostile. I don't feel badly that they are hostile towards me. The hostility went so far that efforts were made on my life in India. But still I can understand their problem, so I will not go to them; I will wait here and spread the message.\nAnd I particularly depend on the young generation, the intelligent people around the world. And they are getting interested in it. I don't have anybody retarded, average. You can meet my people and you can meet Billy Graham's people and you can see the difference. Most of these people have been professors, doctors, engineers; they have degrees, Ph.D., D.Litt. Almost everybody is at least a university graduate. These are intelligent people, not gullible. Billy Graham cannot impress a single sannyasin; and, of course, I cannot impress anybody from Billy Graham's audience. Anything I say will create hostility, enmity.\nThat is the art I have been practicing my whole life, how to influence people and create enemies. So I have stopped influencing... I am just here, and if anybody feels thirsty the well is available. If you don't feel thirsty it is your business, but I'm not preventing you from drinking from my well. I'm available, but I will not even call you to come and drink from my well.\nThe well is there, open, available, so those who are intelligent are going to be caught in my net sooner or later. And I want only the intelligent people, because they are the people who will be able to prevent what is going to happen to humanity.\nThe ordinary masses and the crowds, the cripples and the blind and the sick who go to Billy Graham for some spiritual miracle, to be healed, they are not my people. If somebody is sick, we have a hospital. I don't think there has ever been any miracle in the world, or that there can ever be. Everything happens according to existential laws. If sometime you see something like a miracle, you have to do some research and find how it happened. Mostly it is psychological. There is psychological blindness.\nNow it is a known fact that if a person does not want to see, somewhere deep down in his psychology he has come to the conclusion that he does not want to see. Perhaps he loved a woman who deceived him, and she was the one for whom he wanted his eyes always to be there. Now he does not want to see anybody, and a miracle happens: he goes blind. Nothing is wrong with his physiology; the eye specialist cannot find anything wrong with his eyes, the eye hospital cannot help him. Billy Graham can help him.\nBut he was not blind, and that is why he has started seeing again. He was simply psychologically blind. He really needed a great crowd of believers around him shouting hallelujah, the glory of God, the miracles of Jesus. This whole atmosphere around him makes him courageous enough to see again. The credit should simply go to the crowd, but it goes to Billy Graham. Nothing happens in nature which is against the universal laws.\nQ: DO THOSE LAWS CHANGE?\nA: No. The universal laws never change. Everything changes according to the universal laws, but the universal law itself never changes.\nQ: WHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nA: It is always here. It does not come from anywhere. Why should it come from anywhere? The question is absurd. If I say it comes to New York, you will ask me from where it came in New York. The question is absurd, because whatsoever answer is given, the question will remain the same: from where did it come, from where God came? Nobody asks such a simple question: from where God came? From New York? New Jersey? I have come from New Jersey, but from where God came?\nUniversal law is to me exactly what God is to the believer, to the faithful. But calling it universal law makes a tremendous difference. You cannot worship a law, you cannot pray to a law; the law has no ears, no eyes. The law goes on functioning the way it has always functioned. It won't change for any prayer.\nAll prayers are simply asking that you should be treated as an exception. Somebody is praying to God, \"I am blind, please give me eyes.\" In the first place he is distrusting God... because God made him blind. He wants to change God's mind: \"Please give my eyes back\"and he is ready to bribe God, \"I will believe in you, I will worship you. I will go every Sunday to the church. I will donate to the church, to the congregation.\" These are all bribes: \"Give me my eyes back.\"\nThese simple people -- most of them simpletons -- who gather around Billy Graham and people like him can be easily exploited. All the religious leaders of the world have been doing that for centuries in the name of God. All the religions... not only Christianity.\nMy religion is more a science than a religion. If somebody is sick, he should go to the hospital. We have a beautiful hospital here. If somebody needs education, he should go to the university. We have our own university here. If somebody is feeling anxiety, anguish, tension, nervousness, he should go to the meditation classes. If somebody is having some problems about relationships -- wife and husband and children and friends -- we have therapy groups for him. For every need we have a scientific process.\nBut a miracle is not possible here... because I don't want to exploit gullible people. And what is the point? The world is on the threshold of committing global suicide, and somebody makes a small miracle, gives some solace to one human being, when the whole of humanity is on the brink. It is stupid. These people should think on a larger scale.\nI am absolutely concerned because I see what is going to happen if humanity remains the way it is. But the problem is that if people are not going to listen to me, then it is their business. As far as I am concerned, my work is finished. If this earth simply dies out, it makes no difference to me. I am making an effort with my people that whether the third world war happens or not, you get enlightened! Be awake! -- because this earth may not be able to survive after this century. Only fifteen years are left.\nIt is a great device, too. When you are challenged with global death and the gap is only fifteen years, you have to think about yourself. For the first time, you cannot go on living the same old way, doing the same old stupid things. Something essential that can bring a transformation to your being before the world comes to an end becomes significant. So if my people are awakened, I don't care. If those people don't understand, let them have the third world war. Let them be satisfied to their hearts' content.\nQ: DO YOU THINK THINGS LIKE BIOENGINEERING WOULD PRODUCE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO WANT TO BE AWAKE?\nA: I believe in bioengineering. I want science to create a better man in every way, but the problem is that all the governments are forcing the scientists to create more and more destructive weapons. They are forcing them into the service of death.\nI would like all the scientists to be in the service of life. Then bioengineering certainly can create far superior men, healthier, more talented. In fact, we can fill the whole earth with geniuses; there is no reason why not. We have all the basic things in our hands. We can make man live at least three hundred years very easily without getting old, without having cancer, without having AIDS. This is all that your old past has given as a heritage.\nWe can have people we need: we need more Albert Einsteins, we need more Picassos, we need more van Goghs, and bioengineering can make it available. All kinds of artists, scientists, geniuses, mystics, philosophers, scientists -- we can fill\nthe whole earth with such intelligence and glory that people like Billy Graham will have to commit suicide. Nobody will go and shout around them.\nQ: ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORLD POPULATION?\nA: Certainly. I am very much concerned about the world population, because if somehow we can postpone the nuclear war, the world population is going to kill humanity. It is growing with such a speed that unless science is diverted towards human needs, it is very difficult not to have many Ethiopias. And it is a sad thing that all around you there are people dying and you cannot do anything, you feel almost helpless.\nEverything can be done, but all science is geared towards death. Who cares about Ethiopia or India? Who bothers? Their whole concern is how to be more powerful than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's scientists' whole problem is how to be more powerful than America. And small, stupid nations also are lined up either behind America or behind Russia. There are a few fools like India, too, who think that by remaining unaligned, they will be in a better position and can have the friendship of both sides. They are wrong. They don't understand the ABC of politics. Unaligned, they are enemies of both parties, not friends. Nobody can trust them, and nobody can help them.\nThe world is almost cut into two parts, and the population is growing in the poor countries more because the poor man has no other entertainment than sex. The rich man has many other things. He can afford many other entertainments. He can listen to music, he can enjoy Mozart, he can see a great dancer, he can go to the theater, he can have the best wine available. He has all the beautiful books to read, all the beautiful statues to collect.\nBut the poor man has nothing other than sex as his entertainment. So he goes on producing, and the religious leaders help him to go on producing, because they want more numbers.\nQ: DO YOU ADVOCATE ENFORCED BIRTH CONTROL OR STERILIZATION?\nA: Certainly. Absolute birth control for twenty years... because it is not a question of small importance. If for twenty years there is absolute birth control, it will give two things to humanity. One, the population will start disappearing. I want the world to come to one-fourth of its population; only then can it be a beautiful garden of life. Second, if people become accustomed to birth control for twenty years, sex will not remain a serious problem. After the pill, sex has no significance at all -- it is just fun. It has nothing profane about it and nothing sacred about it. It is just a biological game. And if two persons feel like playing tennis, let them play.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT DISEASES LIKE AIDS?\nA: They are also contributions of your religions, because your religions first forced celibacy on monks and nuns and people. Now, celibacy is absolutely against the laws of biology, against your body.\nNobody has ever been celibate, unless he was impotent, and nobody can ever be celibate. He can pretend he is celibate, but from the back door he will find all kinds of perversions. Homosexuality was born in the monastery. That is why I say it is a religious contribution. Monks living in separation from women, nuns living in separation from men -- what do you expect? Those monks are going to start homosexuality.\nIt is now a well-recognized fact that animals in the wild never become homosexuals, but in zoos they do. It is very revealing. In the zoos, if there are no females the animals become homosexuals. And your monasteries are nothing but zoos. They converted men into homosexuals, women into lesbians.\nAIDs is the ultimate outcome of homosexuality, and the pope should take responsibility for it. Mother Teresa should take responsibility for it, the shankaracharya should take responsibility for it, Ayatollah Khomeini should take the responsibility for it. These are the people.\nMy approach is: Stop this nonsense of celibacy! Let your monks also have fun with their biology -- it is a gift of nature, beautiful. Let your nuns also enjoy their bodies. Why are you making them dead before they are dead?\nIf I am listened to, I will make nunneries and monasteries mixed, and I will take away all barriers which prevent people from taking sex just as fun. It is not a sin. It is not something to be repressed. That is as stupid as somebody repressing urination. I wonder why there has not been some religion preaching celibacy as far as pissing is concerned? -- and believe me, there will be people who will follow that ideology also. Of course, they will have to piss somewhere, hiding, but before the world they will be celibate.\nThis AIDS is certainly one of the major problems, just as much as a third world war. Unless homosexuality and lesbianism disappear completely, we cannot prevent it from spreading. So heterosexuality should be preached from every pulpit; it should be rewarded, praised, and the people who do not follow heterosexuality should be put under treatment. They are psychologically sick.\nIf we want AIDS to disappear, then homosexuality and lesbianism have to disappear. Otherwise, there is no way. Medical science has not been able to figure out any medical cure for it. It is a sure killer. Once you have it, you can live at the most two years more -- that is at the most. More probably you will live not more than six months; and it is good if you die sooner, because the longer you live, the more you will spread it.\nNow the rich people who have AIDS are hiding it. Only the poor people become exposed to the public. The rich people have their private physicians; they can manage that the physician keep his mouth shut. They don't want their families to\nknow that they have AIDS. They don't want anybody to think that they have AIDS.\nI know senators in America who have AIDS. I know senators who are homosexuals. But the trouble is, these people are in power; the doctor cannot say anything, and they go on and on spreading it. There have been great artists, painters, poets who were homosexuals. We should look to stop every homosexual from having any further contact with any man or woman. If we cannot stop them.…\nWe have found two persons having AIDS in our commune. We immediately put them into isolation far away in the mountains with everything comfortable provided for them. All that we can manage, we give to them; but they should not mix with the other people of the commune, because AIDS can be caught not only by sexual intercourse, it can be caught even by kissing.\nKissing should be completely prohibited all over the world. Of course, people will feel a little awkward, they will need some substitute. My substitute is that lovers should start changing from kissing to rubbing their noses together. And enjoy it... what else can be done? There are aboriginal tribes where this already happens. They rub their noses, they don't kiss. They are far more scientific. Kissing is not hygienic at all; rubbing noses is perfectly hygienic.\nQ: IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COLD.\nA: That is not much of a problem. A cold is such a small problem that even if you catch it, nothing is wrong in it. It lasts for seven days if you don't take any medicine; if you take medicine it lasts one week -- so what is the problem in it?\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #15 Chapter title: I Am Not The A Prophet 1 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 26.]\nChristopher Reed THE GUARDIAN LONDON, ENGLAND\nQUESTION: GOOD EVENING. YES, THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER IN ENGLAND. IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, IT'S A LIBERAL, SERIOUS -- AS OPPOSED TO TABLOID -- DAILY NEWSPAPER. AND I ALSO DO WORK FOR A SIMILAR PAPER IN AUSTRALIA, THE MELBOURNE AGE, AND A SIMILAR PAPER IN CANADA CALLED THE GLOBAL MAIL IN TORONTO. I'VE BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE, THREE YEARS AGO, AND I'M ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE DIFFERENCE I FIND TODAY. ASTONISHING, ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING! -- SO MUCH SO THAT I COULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE ANY LANDMARKS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS SO DIFFERENT. AND YOU'VE BEEN LIVING HERE ALL THIS TIME. DOES IT GIVE YOU A LOT OF JOY TO SEE THE PLACE FLOWERING? OR DON'T YOU INTEREST YOURSELF A LOT IN THAT?\nANSWER: I am absolutely interested. This place has to become one of the most beautiful places on the earth.\nQ: DO YOU THINK IT WILL? YOU HAVE YOUR TROUBLES, EH?\nA: No troubles.\nQ: WITH THE NEIGHBORS...?\nA: We enjoy it.\nQ: IN YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE, I READ IN YOUR PAPER HERE THAT YOU ONLY GAVE A ONE-WORD ANSWER WHEN YOU WERE ASKED IF YOU AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD EVER COEXIST PEACEFULLY. YOU SAID: \"NEVER.\" THAT'S A LONG TIME.\nA: That's true. In the first place, we don't have any neighbors here. In these 126 square miles, we are alone -- an island in itself. In the second place, I don't believe in any compromise. If they are right, we will mix with them, we will drop our own philosophy of life. And if we are right, then they have to drop their prejudices. But I don't believe in coexistence; I believe in existence. Either we, or they.…\nCoexistence is a political word, and coexistence is simply a cold war. Just to avoid, postpone real war, politicians go on talking about coexistence. If I love you, we don't coexist, we exist together. Only enemies coexist. I don't have any enemies. If they are hostile, that is their problem. We are not hostile towards anybody.\nQ: I SEE YOU USE THE WORD COEXISTENCE. IT HAS BECOME POLITICAL, INDEED, BUT YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU COEXIST IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE, SO YOU TOLERATE IT; AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU WOULD RATHER ENJOY LIVING WITH THESE PEOPLE. DO I INTERPRET YOU CORRECTLY?\nA: Tolerance is an ugly word. To tolerate means you have already humiliated the other person, you are already higher, holier, more understanding. The people who talk about tolerance are the most intolerant people. I never tolerate; either I accept, or I simply forget all about the person. Why should I tolerate? He has the right to be himself. I have the right to be myself. There is no need for any tolerance.\nAnd they are hostile, we are not hostile. So we enjoy their hostility; that is the only entertainment in this desert.\nQ: BUT IT'S NO LONGER A DESERT, AS WE HAVE SEEN.\nA: We will change it into an oasis -- we are changing.\nQ: BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD MISUNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE SAID ABOUT TOLERANCE, WHO HAVEN'T THE BENEFIT OF SITTING HERE AND THINKING IT OVER, AND DISCUSSING IT AND EXPLORING THE IDEA? THEY SEE IT, IF YOU LIKE, IN PRINT, AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ALL THEIR LIVES, IN THIS COUNTRY AT LEAST -- IT SEEMS TO ME -- IN DEMOCRACIES, THAT TOLERANCE IS A GOOD THING, THAT ONE SHOULD TOLERATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE ALTERNATIVE IS IN FACT HOSTILITY, POSSIBLY LEADING TO VIOLENCE.\nA: No, that is not the only alternative. They are wrong. Just listen to the sound of the word tolerance: there is hostility in it. Already you have accepted that there is\nno possibility of friendship, there is no possibility of being together lovingly. Tolerance simply means somehow to live and let them live. It is not a beautiful word, it is certainly ugly. There is no need for tolerance if there is no hostility. It is simply to cover up hostility.\nWe don't tolerate anybody because we are not hostile in the first place. For example, Jesus says, \"Love your enemies,\" but that means first you have to create enemies; otherwise, how are you going to love enemies?\nQ: THERE ARE PEOPLE, THOUGH, IN THE WORLD, THAT WE'VE NEVER MET AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL MEET WHO JUST START OUT LIFE PURSUING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GOALS WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE, A DIFFERENT SET OF VALUES FROM OURSELVES. AND WHO'S TO SAY WHICH IS THE BETTER SET OF VALUES? WHEN YOU SAY, \"LIVE AND LET LIVE,\" THAT ALSO, DOES IT NOT, MEANS TOLERANCE, AND THEREFORE, IN ORDER FOR THESE TWO IDEAS TO LIVE AND LET LIVE WITH EACH OTHER, YOU HAVE TO ADOPT THIS UGLY WORD TOLERANCE AND TOLERATE EACH OTHER?\nA: No. I accept their right to be themselves, I am not tolerating; I will criticize them if I feel it is wrong. It is out of compassion and love that I will criticize them because I am concerned about them. Tolerance simply means go to hell -- we aren't bothered.\nThere are different sets of values, different ideologies, and I love the freedom for myself, and for them. They may be against me, that does not make any difference. I will fight for their freedom too, just the way I will fight for my freedom. But I will not tolerate. I will criticize them.\nEither someday they have to accept me, or someday I have to accept them. Tolerance means that we have decided that now there is no possibility of any bridge, so what to do? Just let them be, and you be. I am not.…\nQ: SO THAT'S YOUR USE OF THE WORD never, THEN, BECAUSE YOU MEAN INFINITY?\nA: Infinity? -- to the very end of infinity, I will not tolerate anybody.\nQ: I SEE. SURE. WHEN YOU MENTIONED DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES -- AGAIN REFERRING TO SOME OF THE ANSWERS YOU GAVE -- YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY... I DON'T THINK YOU SAID, \"BELIEVE, \" THAT YOU DIDN'T APPROVE... DON'T GET INSTITUTIONALIZED. YOU SAY YOU FIGHT THAT. AND DON'T BECOME AN ORGANIZATION, REMAIN AN ORGANISM. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T REALLY APPROVE OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RELIGION. I READ THAT AND THEN I LOOK AT THE SIGN ON MY HOTEL WALL -- YOUR HOTEL HERE -- AND IT SAYS\n\"RAJNEESHISM.\" I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT -- AGAIN IT'S SEMANTICS, PERHAPS -- BUT ism WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST A STRUCTURE, AN IDEOLOGY WHICH WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST ALSO AN ORGANIZATION. SO THAT IF YOU HAVE RAJNEESHISM, YOU'RE BOUND TO BECOME ORGANIZED.\nA: That is simply the poverty of language. There is no other word to replace ism. It is just out of necessity that my people have used that word; otherwise, there is no ism here, no organization here. We are living in an organic unity. But it is always a problem with language: language is old, language is coming from thousands of years, and you have to use that language.\nAn ism needs a certain dogma; we have none. An ism needs a certain discipline; we have none. An ism needs a fanatic approach; we do not have any fanaticism. So it is just a necessary evil that we have to use the word ism. If you can suggest another word, we can change it.\nQ: WELL, RAJNEESHISM HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A CULT. DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT?\nA: Absolutely. Q: YOU DO?\nA: Yes\nQ: WHY WOULD YOU DISAGREE?\nA: Because we are not a cult. Christianity is a cult, Mohammedanism is a cult, Hinduism is a cult. You have to understand my idea about the cult: When the Master is alive, it is religion; when the Master is dead, then it is only a corpse. And that corpse becomes the cult.\nWith Jesus, Christianity was a religion. Jesus gone, now it is just a dead weight over humanity. For two thousand years we have been carrying a corpse.\nI am still alive, that's why I say this is religion, not a cult. And I tell my people: the moment I am gone, please disperse. Don't keep any church behind me. We don't want any popes, and we don't want any Vatican, and we don't want any dead thing to be carried by the coming generations.\nQ: I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING, TO BE QUITE HONEST. I DON'T SEE YOUR ADHERENTS HERE, YOUR DISCIPLES, FOLLOWERS, FELLOWS IN YOUR COMMUNITY -- HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THEM -- I CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM JUST DISPERSING LIKE THAT, SORT OF THE DAY AFTER.…\nA: That's up to them. I cannot force them, I can simply say. I never force anything.\nQ: SO YOUR FINAL WISHES WILL BE DISOBEYED, THEN...?\nA: Yes, if they want to disobey me, they are absolutely free. That's the difference. I am not a prophet, or a messiah, or a messenger of God. My word is not the authority. They have to think over it and decide on their own -- and take the responsibility. But nobody can throw the responsibility on me.\nQ: WELL, YOU'RE ON THE RECORD! WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NO ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE, I MUST SAY, LOOKING AROUND COMING BACK THREE YEARS LATER, I SEE PEOPLE -- I THOUGHT THEY WERE CHAUFFEURS, EVERYONE WEARING THESE SORT OF PLUMCOLORED PEAKED CAPS. THEY APPEARED TO BE UNIFORMS, IN FACT, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO APPEAR -- I DON'T MEAN JUST THE CHOICE OF THE COLORS, BUT ACTUALLY WEARING IDENTICAL CLOTHES -- I MEAN THIS WOULD STRIKE ME INSTANTLY AS ORGANIZATION OF A QUITE EXTREME KIND.\nA: It is not. I have given these red clothes to my people so that I can recognize them and the whole world can recognize them. This is their identity card, all over the body, so there is no need to pull it out of the pocket and show to people who you are. But it is not an organization, and I don't think that there is any spirituality in the color red. You can see me: I hate the color red!\nQ: (INDICATING HIS FEET) THESE SOCKS WERE GIVEN TO ME!\nA: I hate them! I have put my people in red because that is the only color I will not use.\nQ: I TAKE THE POINT, BUT I MEANT NOT REALLY THE CHOICE OF A CERTAIN COLOR -- FAIR ENOUGH, OR VARIATIONS ON IT -- NO, THESE PEOPLE THAT I SAW WERE WEARING IDENTICAL CLOTHES. THEY WERE CUT THE SAME WAY, THE SAME SHIRTS. THEY MATCHED, IN OTHER WORDS, IDENTICAL... LIKE AN ARMY.\nA: If they love to have identical clothes, it is perfectly okay. Q: DO YOU THINK THEY DO? HAVE YOU ASKED THEM?\nA: I have never asked. That is their business. And if you look closely, they are using different shades of red. That is up to them what they do. And they are using different kinds of clothes, not similar. Yet there are a few uniformed people that belong to the police department of Oregon. They want them to be in a certain uniform, so we have to put them in a uniform. But they belong to the police force of Oregon; you must have seen their caps and everything.\nQ: BUT THEY'RE IN RED.…\nA: Here they have to be red.\nQ: THEN THE POLICE DON'T MIND IF THEY WEAR RED?\nA: Here they have to be red. Even if the governor wants to be the governor of Rajneeshpuram, he will have to be in red. This is just to shock the people around the world. And it has proved of great significance.\nFor example, thousands of people have come to me in all these thirty years. Those who became sannyasins remain somehow related with me. Even if after thirty years they come, I recognize them, I remember them; and they also feel a certain connection with me. Others had also come, had loved me, but never became sannyasins. They are lost in the big world. I cannot recognize them, and I don't think there is any communion existing between me and them. This has been immensely helpful. I know where my people are and I know whether they are increasing or decreasing. I know what they are doing, and I know that I can suggest to them -- I never order, I can advise -- to take it or not to take it is their business. I am happy both ways.\nAnd, secondly, my red people around the world have shocked everybody. That is of great importance. The moment you shock somebody, he starts thinking about you, he starts inquiring about you. He becomes curious what is the matter. He starts reading my books. So many people have come here and become sannyasins and told me that the first experience was of a shock.\nBut that shock led them to inquire, to read, and finally they ended up here. So this has been of tremendous significance, useful. And it has made my people also strong because moving in red clothes in society you immediately become the focus, the center -- you need some guts to face all kinds of hostility. It creates something like steel in you. My people have been expelled from universities as professors, from schools as teachers, from businesses, simply because they were wearing red clothes.\nQ: THAT'S KIND OF A HARSH PENALTY FOR WEARING RED CLOTHES.\nA: But a person who is ready to renounce the job, a good salary in the university, just to be himself, becomes stronger. I don't want my people to be ignored.\nHostility is perfectly okay. Hate I accept, opposition I welcome. Even if they start shooting my people, there is no problem. But I would never like my people to be ignored.\nQ: I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH. TALKING ABOUT NOT WEARING RED, IT WOULD BE TRUE, OF COURSE, WOULDN'T IT, THAT BY YOUR NOT WEARING RED, EVERYBODY LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON NOT WEARING RED? AND YOU DID SAY THAT YOU'RE THE GREAT SHOWMAN, AND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE SHOWMANSHIP, WOULD IT?\nA: Certainly.\nQ: VERY GOOD! AND YOUR ROBES, THEY ARE ALSO PART OF THE SHOWMANSHIP?\nA: Part -- everything is part of my showmanship.\nQ: DO YOU DESIGN THEM YOURSELF OR DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE...?\nA: My people design everything for me.\nQ: OH, IT'S NOT YOUR CREATION, THEN? I THOUGHT YOU CHOSE THEM YOURSELF.\nA: No. No need, because I have so many intelligent people from every profession. We have the best legal experts, we have the best professors, scientists, carpenters, seamstresses, tailors, we have every kind of people. Our commune is absolutely self-sufficient. So I have my seamstresses who design, and they are doing so well that I need not interfere. I love whatsoever they are doing.\nI have my own jewelers -- you just look at my watch! Q: I SAW, YES. I'VE EVEN READ ABOUT IT.\nA: My own people made my watch. Q: OH, REALLY?\nA: And these are real stones, remember. They are not diamonds, they are real stones!\nQ: GLASS, CUT GLASS?\nA: But idiots think it is a fake watch: it is real stones, authentic stones. They are fools, they think it is diamonds. Then they start thinking it is a fake watch. It is not a fake watch, it is as authentic, existential, as any diamond can be.\nQ: DOES IT TELL THE TIME AS WELL THEN?\nA: The best! My people don't do anything less than the best!\nQ: AND YOU WEAR SILK. IS THAT YOUR PREFERENCE? I THINK WHEN I WAS HERE LAST, YOU WERE WEARING MORE WOVEN, SORT OF NATURAL -- LOOKING FABRIC.\nA: My people were doing that.\nQ: HAVE YOU GONE UP IN THE WORLD, TO SILK?\nA: My people were weaving those clothes. I liked them, but then my physicians were not ready for me to use even synthetic wool, because I am allergic.\nQ: OH, SURE. I KNOW THAT.\nA: So I had to drop those beautiful dresses, and I had to move to other clothes. So this is my physicians' change.\nQ: ROTTEN OLD SILK.\nA: Yes. Whenever we change, we go higher.\nQ: AND I ALSO READ THAT YOUR CARS -- YOU DON'T OWN THESE, OF COURSE; THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HERE, IN FACT; AND THAT... SO REALLY, YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING.\nA: I don't have anything.\nQ: IT STRIKES ME THAT IT'S COSTING YOUR FOLLOWERS A FORTUNE TO KEEP YOU IN POVERTY.\nA: That is true, but they enjoy it and they love it. If I refuse it, they will have heart attacks!\nQ: I WAS WONDERING -- ALL THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE MEDIA ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE AND SORT OF AGONIZED APPRAISALS OF THE SPIRITUALITY AND THE RELIGION AND ITS\nCONTENT, AND HOW RELIGIOUS IT IS OR IS NOT... AND YOU SAY, WELL, YOU'RE A SHOWMAN. IT STRUCK ME THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE OUGHT TO TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD.\nA: Every religious Master has been a showman, and I have defeated them all.\nQ: BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN? WHY DO ALL THE RELIGIOUS MASTERS HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN?\nA: It helps their work. It attracts people to them, and those who come close, they know that the showmanship is just on the outside. Inside there is immense work to be done.\nQ: IMMENSE WORK? WOULD YOU LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THAT? WOULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THE IMMENSE WORK... YOU DON'T MEAN IN A PRACTICAL WAY?\nA: That means meditation. That they have to become more conscious, more alert, and finally they have to come to a point where their unconsciousness becomes completely conscious.\nSigmund Freud divides consciousness into three layers: consciousness, subconsciousness, unconsciousness. Meditation moves in the same way, from conscious to subconscious: the conscious overwhelms the subconscious and finally it overwhelms the unconscious.\nIf Sigmund Freud was to look into one of my sannyasins, he would be surprised.…\nQ: EVEN HE, EH?\nA: Yes. Because there is no division, there is only single consciousness. There is no shadow, no darkness around. So that is the inner work -- and showmanship certainly helps. The other religious leaders never said they were showmen. They had no guts to say the truth. Don't you think Jesus was a showman?\nQ: OH, YEAH. MIRACLES, THAT'S PRETTY.…\nA: Yes, miracles and walking on water, and bringing dead back to life and proclaiming himself the only begotten son of God. I don't do any such stupid things. But all religious leaders of the world have been showmen in different ways. The founder of Jainism, Mahavira, remained naked. Now, that is great showmanship, without clothes... you cannot think that he is a showman, but what is the point of being naked? He never used any razors, blades. Every year\nhe would pull out his hair, and thousands of people would gather there, tears in their eyes because their leader is pulling out his hair. Every year it was a great congregation of his followers. And what was he doing? Because he said that he would not use any mechanism -- even a razor is technology -- he made great showmanship out of pulling his own hairs. And this needs only a little practice, nothing much; once you have learned it, you can do it.\nI am the first religious man who is telling you exactly what is the case. I am exposing myself totally, I am not keeping any secret, no private life. All your religious leaders were somehow cheating, exploiting, deceiving.\nQ: I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE. I PERSONALLY AM AN ATHEIST, SO THIS IS MUSIC TO MY EARS. BUT THEN, YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE WHO IS NOT?\nA: Certainly.\nQ: I BELIEVE YOU, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIM?\nA: For example, no religious leader will accept that he is not celibate. All religions require celibacy, and celibacy is impossible. It is scientifically impossible.\nQ: WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE, IS IT, BECAUSE... I MEAN THE ORIGINAL MORMONS WERE POLYGAMOUS, WEREN'T THEY? AND SO THEY MADE A VIRTUE, THE MEN AT LEAST, OUT OF MANY WIVES -- AND MUCH SEX, I PRESUME. SO NOT ALL RELIGIONS -- I MEAN MANY, BUT NOT QUITE ALL, SURELY...?\nA: There have been a few religions who made that, too, a virtue, and that was for the same purpose. For example, Mohammed had nine wives. Now that too is showmanship. He allows Mohammedans to have only four. Only the prophet can have nine, he keeps himself special. So what other religions were doing with celibacy, he was doing with the number of women. The basic thing is the same: that he is special, higher, holier than thou.\nQ: BUT YOU'RE SPECIAL TOO, AREN'T YOU? A: No.\nQ: I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN OR WOMAN HERE WHO ENTERS A BUILDING ON A PATH STREWN WITH ROSE LEAVES. I THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIRLY SPECIAL.\nA: That is their joy. I am not special. I have not asked them. If they don't put the flowers, I will never inquire what happened to the flowers. If they don't dance, I will not inquire what happened to the dancers. I can dance alone. Just I need the camera.…\nQ: SHOWMANSHIP, YES! I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.\nA: No, I am not.\nQ: YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO DOESN'T WEAR RED, OR A SHADE OF RED.…\nA: Because I am not a sannyasin. I am nobody's follower.\nQ: NO, BUT IN THIS CONTEXT, THAT'S ANOTHER SPECIAL THING ISN'T IT?\nA: No, it is not. You are here also.\nQ: TWO OF US! YES, WELL INDEED I AM SPECIAL FOR SOME OF THOSE SAME REASONS -- BECAUSE I AM NOT A SANNYASIN, I'M NOT DRESSED IN RED, IN WORKING.…\nA: No, you are not special. Every day journalists are here, you are not special. You are a guest only for one day or two days; I am a guest for a little longer time; that is the only difference. I can leave this place any moment. I don't even live in Rajneeshpuram, in the city. I live outside.\nQ: IN WASCO COUNTY, EH?\nA: In Wasco County.\nQ: SURE, BUT I MEAN AS I SAY, YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY SEEK BEING SPECIAL, BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT'S THE CASE, ISN'T IT?\nA: No.\nQ: I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN DENY THAT, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN JUST AN EYEWITNESS WOULD LOOK AT THE CROWD AND SAY, \"HE'S SPECIAL, HE'S WEARING BLUE.\"\nA: Anybody will get that idea that I am special. But I myself am saying I am not. I am just a guest here, and if they enjoy my being here, I can remain here. I don't have any belongings, I haven't had anything for almost thirty years, no bank balance, not a single cent: I don't have even pockets in my dress. Even if I have to leave this place, somebody will have to arrange a ticket for me because I don't have anything. I think, I hope, the American government will do it.\nQ: I AM REMINDED OF ANOTHER CLASS OF PEOPLE, VERY SELECT AND SMALL CLASS OF PEOPLE, WHO DON'T CARRY MONEY, LIKE YOURSELF, AND THAT'S ROYALTY. THE QUEEN NEVER CARRIES MONEY, AND THAT IS A SORT OF MARK OF BEING SPECIAL, BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER, WHICH ELEVATES HER IN IMPORTANCE, DOESN'T IT?\n-- SO IT MAKES HER SPECIAL. SHE'S A GREAT SHOW WOMAN AS WELL.\nA: They have to do it for her. They have to do it for her, and she knows she is special and she has never said that she is not.\nQ: THEY DON'T HAVE TO, DO THEY? I DON'T KNOW; I MEAN, I'VE NEVER GONE INTO IT BUT THEY WISH TO DO SO, PRESUMABLY.\nA: She is special. She belongs to the royal family, she has the special blood that is only stupidity -- and everything that she gets is ordered. If it is not given to her there will be problems immediately. For me there is no question of ordering anybody. I am not of royal blood, because I don't think that any blood is royal; and she must be special, otherwise who would choose such an ugly woman as a queen?\nQ: OH, ABSOLUTELY! I KNOW, SHOCKING, SHOCKING, NATIONAL DISGRACE. A NATIONAL DISGRACE -- HER SON AS WELL, AWFUL, ISN'T\nA: Yes, he is retarded.\nQ: THOROUGHLY, YEAH; WELL HE IS AN UPPER CLASS ENGLISHMAN, SO HE MUST BE.\nA: And that retarded son soon will become your king.…\nQ: L KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S A SHOCKING THOUGHT. THERE'S HOPE YET; THERE COULD BE A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, BUT PROBABLY NOT LIKELY.\nA: In England, you think, a communist revolution...?\nQ: NO, I'M AFRAID NOT. WELL KARL MARX THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE, ACTUALLY. HE THOUGHT GERMANY AND BRITAIN WOULD BE THE PLACES WHERE THERE WOULD BE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION.\nA: Karl Marx proved wrong on all the counts.…\nQ: ON A LOT OF THINGS... RIGHT, SURE, RIGHT -- ANOTHER ISM. YOU'VE SAID SOME REALLY CRITICAL THINGS ABOUT COMMUNISM. DO YOU MEAN COMMUNISM AS THE SYSTEM IN THE SOVIET UNION AT THE MOMENT, OR DO YOU MEAN THE COMMUNISM ENVISAGED BY KARL MARX AND ENGELS?\nA: I mean both. Karl Marx, Engels, they were simply bookworms. Karl Marx spent his whole life in the British Museum. He knew nothing about the real humanity. He knew nothing about the mechanics of how evolution goes on. He was only concerned with the British Museum. Before the museum opened he was there, standing, and many times he was carried out of the museum unconscious, because he worked so hard on the books that he was found unconscious and had to be taken in an ambulance.\nQ: MAYBE HE MEDITATED TOO MUCH... LAPSED INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS.\nA: He never meditated for a single moment. If he had meditated for a single moment, communism would have a different quality and flavor to it. He was simply the mind. And meditation is a state of no mind. You don't go for meditation to the British Museum.\nHe was a scholar, a great scholar, but whatsoever he said did not prove right. He was thinking that communism would happen in the richest countries, which was a logical conclusion of his philosophy, that where the division between the poor and the rich is bigger the revolution will happen. And the revolution has happened in Soviet Russia -- which he had never dreamed -- revolution has happened in China. If he wakes up in his grave, he will not be able to believe what has happened. Soviet Russia was a poor country, China even poorer; his whole idea of class struggle went wrong.\nIn America there is no possibility for communism for the simple reason that most of the Americans are middle class. The super-rich are few, on one hand, and the super-poor are few, on the other hand; and the middle class is never for revolution The middle class has too much to risk. Revolution is possible only when you have nothing to lose. The middle class has much to lose, and the middle class also has the hope that sooner or later they are going to enter into the higher, the super-rich. They cannot lose that hope by creating a revolution.\nI am completely against Karl Marx for the simple reason that no two human beings are equal. Equality is psychologically wrong, physiologically wrong. Every individual is unique and incomparable. I am not saying that somebody is higher and somebody is lower. I am simply saying it is absurd to compare a marigold with a rose flower. It is not that the rose flower is higher and the marigold is poor; they are different. People are so different and unique.\nI believe in the individuality of human beings, and I don't want them to be counted in a class that makes numbers of them and destroys their individuality: you are the proletariat. Then the dass is important, you are not. That's what has happened in Russia. All individuality has been erased, and if anybody tries to be individual, like the man Sakharov, then immediately he is punished. You cannot be individuals. The nation, the society, the communist party -- you can be a member, but you cannot assert your individuality. Now, Sakharov is one of the best physicists of the contemporary world, and he is suffering in Siberia. And he had not done anything.…\nQ: EXCEPT DISAGREE.…\nA:... Just he had signed a few petitions for other scientists who were suffering, and this was enough to finish that man completely.\nQ: WITH YOUR BELIEF IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE SUPREMACY OF THAT, THEN THE USA WOULD BE THE PLACE FOR YOU TO BE, OF COURSE, WOULDN'T IT? -- AND HERE YOU ARE. BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST THE NATIONAL PHILOSOPHY, ALMOST THE CULT -- IT'S BEEN CALLED THE CULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL, HASN'T IT? BUT THERE ARE CRITICS WHO SAY THAT IT LEADS TO LACK OF COMPASSION, A LACK OF CIVIC SENSE, A LACK OF SOCIAL COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT'S WHY, WHEN YOU SAID THERE ARE VERY FEW POOR PEOPLE, THAT MAY BE SO, COMPARED WITH STARVING PEOPLE IN ETHIOPIA. BUT IN AMERICA'S OWN TERMS, THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF LISTS THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFICIALLY POOR -- IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS, THE BASIC NEEDS, THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY AND SO ON.\nAS YOU WELL KNOW, I'M SURE, THE REASON FOR THIS HAS BEEN GIVEN AS THE EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUALITY TO THE POINT THAT THE COMMUNITY IS NEGLECTED, AND YOU'VE GOT PRIVATE WEALTH AND PUBLIC SQUALOR. DO YOU ACCEPT THAT? IS THAT A CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LIVE WITH?\nA: Just wait. You have asked so many things. First, America is a hypocritical country, so whatsoever they say is one thing and the reality is totally different. In\nthese four years being here, I have started believing that Oregon belongs to the Soviet Union, not to America.\nThey are fascists. They are fanatics. They talk about freedom of expression, freedom of the individual, but we are denied everything.\nQ: YOU MEAN YOU, HERE?\nA: Yes. They have been trying to destroy us in every possible way. It is not a democracy; it is only a pretension.\nSecondly, when the American government recognizes that thirty million people here are poor, you should remember that that is according to the American standard. Those thirty million people in India will not be poor, they will be middle class.\nQ: YES, SURE. IT'S RELATIVE.\nA: It IS very relative. To be poor in America is far better than to be richer in India.\nQ: WELL, IF I MAY SAY, I WOULDN'T AGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE CAGED BIRD, ISN'T IT? -- -BORN IN THE CAGE IS A DIFFERENT MATTER THAN CATCHING A BIRD AND PUTTING IT IN A CAGE -- AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE POOR PERSON IN AMERICA MIGHT BE RICH COMPARED WITH THE PEASANT IN BANGLADESH. BUT THE PEASANT IN BANGLADESH IS NOT NECESSARILY BEING EXPOSED EVERY DAY TO INCREDIBLE RICHES. OR CERTAINLY NOT THE WAY THEY ARE HERE. HERE, IT'S THE CONSTANT TAUNTING, ALMOST, THE CONTRAST OF THE TWO, THAT MAKES FOR A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND DISSATISFACTION, DOES IT NOT?\nA: It is good; it is healthy, because it keeps them going on, bringing their intelligence, their potential. America allows them to struggle for themselves, and the contrast is there so they know people can make it, people have made their mark, and if they are failing they are responsible themselves.\nIn the Soviet Union they will not feel like that because there is nobody to be compared with. The Soviet Union is a poor country, still. It is not that the poor have disappeared and the poverty has disappeared from Russia. On the contrary, the rich have disappeared, and poverty has been distributed equally, so all are equally poor.\nAnd man has a psychological necessity to have somebody ahead of him; otherwise, he is a lazy animal. If there is nothing to achieve, nobody to compete with, he relaxes into whatsoever situation he is in. Russia will never become rich for the simple reason that the Russians are all poor. They don't have anybody there whom they would also like to be. In a free society where individuality is\nrespected, it is the individual's responsibility if he is poor. All opportunities are there for him not to be poor.\nQ: WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE, IN JUST THIS RECENT ANSWER THAT YOU GAVE TO MY QUESTION -- I BELIEVE THAT IF I WROTE THAT OUT VERBATIM AND SHOWED IT TO SOMEONE WHEN I LEAVE THIS PLACE TOMORROW AND SAID THAT AN AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN TOLD ME THIS LAST NIGHT, THEY WOULD READ IT AND SAY, 'YES, OF COURSE, THAT'S THE THING THEY USUALLY DO SAY.\" IT SOUNDS TO ME VERY MUCH LIKE THE WORDS OF A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN AMERICAN POLITICIAN. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN THIS, OF COURSE, BUT I'M A BIT SURPRISED THAT, WITH YOUR EMPHASIS OF COMPASSION, HUMANITY, LOVE OF INDIVIDUAL, YOU COULD SOUND SO MUCH LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE, IN FACT, ACCUSED OF HAVING NONE OF THOSE THINGS.\nA: In fact, it is because of my compassion and love for them that I am saying it. I would like people to prove themselves. That is part of my compassion. I would like them to struggle and prove their mettle, I would not like them to become numbers. That is out of my love. And I am not a politician, Republican or Democratic. I am not a politician at all.\nBut the poor has to be given a chance to rise. Opportunities should be made available to the poor; but communism gives no opportunity. It forces equality, which is wrong. In that equality, the people who are genius creators of wealth disappear. Henry Ford cannot be born in Soviet Russia. Even Karl Marx cannot be born in Soviet Russia; impossible! -- they won't allow such a man.\nIt is my compassion. It is not my politics; it is my love. And people have the potential, you just have to give them the challenge. And if the American government is failing with thirty million people, it is not the philosophy of individuality; it is the American government's stupidity. They should make more opportunities available -- and they can, but their whole energy is going into nuclear weapons. In America there is no need for anybody to be poor, but the American government is interested in nuclear weapons. They have another race going on with Soviet Russia which keeps Russia poor, which keeps America's thirty million poor, and small poor countries also joining in the race out of fear. This nuclear race is making the whole world a big Ethiopia. I would like the American government to stop completely piling up nuclear weapons. Those thirty million poor will disappear tomorrow. And it is so absurd to go on piling up more and more nuclear weapons, because you have already more than you need. You can destroy humanity seven hundred times, so what more do you want?\nQ: AND YOU BELIEVE IF I READ YOUR MESSAGE CORRECTLY, IN THE QUOTATION FROM YOUR BOOK -- YOU BELIEVE THIS IS INEVITABLE, THEN, THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, THAT THERE WILL BE A HOLOCAUST NUCLEAR STYLE. DOES THIS INCLUDE THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST ABOUT 1990? YOU GAVE A DATE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND -- DID YOU SAY 1990, WAS IT?\nA: Just by the end of the century, because the way things are going -- and they go on continuing -- at the most they can take fifteen years to reach to the climax and then have an explosion.\nQ: I CAN THOROUGHLY ACCEPT AND SEE YOUR REASONING ABOUT THE NUCLEAR THREAT AND THE INEVITABILITY OF A HOLOCAUST, BUT DID YOU NOT ALSO SAY THAT YOU THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE CATACLYSMIC EVENTS -- I THINK YOU SAID IN CALIFORNIA, PARTICULARLY, AND ELSEWHERE -- OF THE KIND ASSOCIATED WITH NATURE, GEOGRAPHY: CATASTROPHES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES? HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?\nA: That too is not a vision. I am not a visionary. That too is part of my reasoning. For example, in my childhood in India, the seasons were absolutely fixed. On a certain day every year for thousands of years the summer has begun, on a certain day the rains have come -- it was absolutely fixed, there was no question of change. But after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that changed. Now in India the weather is no more certain. Something great has happened in the atmosphere.\nAnd these explosions go on. They go on trying in the oceans, at the poles, and if these explosions go on, there is a possibility that the eternal snow of the Himalayas may start melting down. Even if the Himalayas alone melt down, all the oceans will be raised fifty feet. And that is only the Himalayas -- if the North Pole and South Pole also join together, and other small mountains follow, which is natural, then cities like Bombay, Calcutta, Karachi, New York, San Francisco, poor Portland -- all will be gone.\nQ: IN FACT, THE WEATHER IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DIFFERENT, I KNOW THROUGH MY OWN EXPERIENCE. IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS THE USUAL PATTERN HAS GONE AWRY. IS THAT WHY YOU SELECTED CALIFORNIA AS THE SCENE OF THE WORST DISASTERS THAT YOU FEAR?\nA: For many reasons. One, California is in the most perverted psychological state in the whole world: more homosexuality, more lesbianism, more AIDS. Perhaps the ocean will not need to destroy them; they will destroy themselves.\nQ: IT SEEMS I'M GETTING ALL MY INFORMATION OUT OF MY HOTEL ROOM; BUT I SAW IN MY BATHROOM A NOTICE THAT SAID THAT AIDS WILL KILL TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD.…\nA: Perhaps more.\nQ: THAT'S AMAZING... I THINK THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION, ISN'T IT? I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING APPROACHING THAT NUMBER.\nA: It is not the maximum number, it is the minimum. Q: TWO THIRDS?\nA: Yes -- for the simple reason people are not thinking of it, because they are not aware of what AIDS is. They have only heard the name; they don't see the implications of it and how it can spread like wildfire.\nQ: WELL, HOW?\nA: For example: first, wherever there is homosexuality, lesbianism, it is going to spread immediately. One contact with a homosexual is enough for you to get it. Not only that, even kissing a person who has AIDS is enough for the transfer.\nQ: DOCTORS DISAGREE WITH YOU. THEY SAY ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE.\nA: No.\nQ: THEY DO!\nA: No. There are doctors who agree. There is no problem in it: your mouth, my mouth, they all carry thousands of cells, living cells, and saliva is one of the things that carries the AIDS to your mouth. Kissing should be absolutely prohibited.\nQ: HAVE YOU MENTIONED THAT TO...?\nA: To my people I have mentioned. I have told them to start rubbing noses with each other. And there are a few experts who say that there is a possibility even that AIDS can spread just by breathing. It is not yet established and agreed by all, but the possibility is there; and if AIDS can spread through breathing, then it is impossible to avoid it. No precautions can be taken, unless everybody wears a\ndoctor's mask. Only Jaina monks do in India -- they will be saved. They cover both their face and their nose, for different reasons -- they were not aware of AlDS -- but they will be saved.\nQ: WELL, YOU TAKE A VERY PESSIMISTIC VIEW, BUT MAY I PUT THIS TO YOU: GOING BACK TO THE IDEA OF CULTS -- AND YOU SAID THIS IS NOT A CULT, AND YOUR REASONING IS DIFFERENT, I KNOW, FROM A PSYCHOLOGIST, BUT THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO STUDIED CULTS IN THE USA AND ELSEWHERE CALLED DR. MARGARET SINGER. HAVE YOU HEARD OF HER? SHE'S EMINENT AND HAS IMPECCABLE ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS AND SO ON, AND SHE HAS STUDIED A LOT OF THE CULTS. AND SHE SAYS THEY HAVE THINGS IN COMMON, AND SOME OF THE THINGS SHE MENTIONS COULD APPLY HERE.\nONE OF THE THINGS SHE MENTIONS IN PARTICULAR IS THE CREATION OF WHAT SHE CALLS \"GROUP PARANOIA.\" AND THAT IS, THAT IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEADING OR ARE PROMINENT IN THE CULT TO CREATE THE SENSE OF GROUP PARANOIA, BECAUSE BY DOING SO THEY ACHIEVE GREATER LOYALTY, GREATER COMMITMENT FROM THE FAITHFUL.\nWHEN I SEE THE GUNS AND THE SEARCH, AND I SIGN FIVE DOCUMENTS AS A VISITOR, AND WHEN I HEAR YOU ON THE SUBJECT OF AIDS AND NUCLEAR WAR -- WELL MANY OTHERS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT -- BUT YOUR FATALISTIC WORDS ON THE SUBJECT OF AIDS... IT SORT OF ADDS UP.\nA: But let me first. Just wait a minute. Let me first finish that impeccable lady. I\nlove ladies, but not impeccable ladies.\nQ: BUT SHE HAS DEVOTED MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE TO THE STUDY OF RELIGIOUS CULTS.\nA: She is an idiot if she has spent so much time studying cults. Has she studied Christianity as a cult?\nQ: OH, YEAH A: No!\nQ: OH, YES. I MEAN, SHE DEALS. SHE DISCUSSES THAT.\nA: No. Not Christianity. Not Hinduism, not Buddhism, not Mohammedanism. In the cults they will study the Hare Krishna movement, Scientology, the Moonies. And remember, whatsoever criteria they have. For example, if she says that the\ngroup has to be in a kind of paranoia, then she should come here and see. Nobody has any paranoia.\nQ: WELL, AS I SAY, I DON'T OBJECT TO IT, AND I AGREED BEFORE I CAME; BUT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHED, MY LUGGAGE HAS BEEN SEARCHED, AND A DOG HAS SNIFFED OVER THE HIRED CAR THAT I.… AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAPPEN TO ME WHEN I GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\nA: That is because we have been persecuted by the Oregon government and the American government. The responsibility is theirs. We don't like... we hate to search anybody! But what are they trying to do? To send drugs with somebody. They have not been able to find anything against us in four years; now they want to plant. And once we became aware from very reliable sources that now they are trying to plant, that they want to bring drugs or other things and plant them here, then we had to start that search.\nThat is not paranoia, that is simply precaution against idiotic politicians. We have done no harm to anybody, we don't mean to do any harm to anybody. In fact, I hate anybody searching; it is a humiliation, distrust. I don't want to distrust anybody, but what to do? They have tried even to bribe my sannyasins. And whatever I am saying to you may reach to them within just a few hours. They have planted their people amongst the sannyasins.\nQ: OH, SURE. I'LL BET THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FBI PEOPLE SITTING HERE, RIGHT NOW. NO, THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE, I AGREE.\nA: So that's why we had to be cautious. It is such a small commune, they can find anything and destroy it. We will make every effort not to let them do what they want to do. The dog is not searching you; the dog is searching the Attorney General of Oregon. So you please don't feel offended. Those guns are not for you; those guns are for those Oregonians who have been saying that they would like to shoot me, that they would like to destroy, burn the whole commune.\nWe will do everything. We are not suicidal people, nor do we hanker for any martyrdom. This is not another Jonestown. They forced the Jonestown people to commit suicide. We are not the people to commit suicide. We love life, and we will do everything that is possible to prevent their doing any harm to us. Even if we have to invite Soviet Russia for our protection, we are going to do that!\nQ: BUT ALL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OREGON HAS DONE TO YOU, IT SEEMS TO ME, IS HARASS YOU WITH LAWSUITS. HE HASN'T SENT ANY PEOPLE WITH GUNS. I MEAN, HE HASN'T SHOT AT YOU. I MEAN, THE MAN WHO BLEW UP THE HOTEL MAY HAVE BEEN A RANDOM MADMAN.…\nA: No, he is not mad; because he jumped bail and for one and a half years he has been hiding. Now he has been caught again. He is not mad.\nQ: WELL, MAD PEOPLE CAN RUN AWAY AS WELL AS SANE PEOPLE.\nA: No. Mad people will not be so intelligent, the way he has been. But I'm not concerned with that\nI am concerned with the Attorney General and the Governor. They had a secret meeting. They did not allow any journalists -- they talk about freedom! -- and the meeting was about us. They did not even allow one of our representatives so that he could present the case from our side. And the Governor told the press, \"I will give you the information after our meeting.\" And whatsoever he said was an absolute lie...! Because the confidential secret file has been found. They thought that it had been burned, but it has been found, and it has been shown on television.\nIn the secret file, they say that the army should be kept on alert, that the army should be aware that if they are ordered, then in three hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram. And you ask me about these few toy guns that my people have! And this man, Governor Atiyeh, told the press conference,\n\"We are trying to cool down the atmosphere. We are trying to get the commune people and the people of Oregon to cool down, not to get too heated.\" This is what he gave to the press conference. And inside the conference, they decide for the army to be ready so they can reach here in three hours' time.\nWe have now filed a case against the state for conspiracy. Now we have the document, and what have we done that they think they need the army and the military to reach here? So these few toy guns are just... my people love me and they want to protect me. But you should understand that it is silly. What can you do with these toy guns? In a nuclear age, these toy guns should be given to children to play with.\nQ: BUT I DON'T SEE, PERSONALLY, THAT THERE'S NEED FOR SUCH WEAPONRY BECAUSE THE THREAT HASN'T BEEN OF THAT MAGNITUDE.\nA: No? You think putting the army on alert and telling them to be ready any moment...?\nQ: WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I HAVEN'T READ THAT.\nA: You don't know that. Your ignorance does not mean that you have to make an opinion -- then try to know it before you make an opinion.\nQ: I MEAN, I MIGHT ASK FOR PROOF. THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, IF IT WAS ON A DOCUMENT. THEN I WOULD ACCEPT IT.\nA: Yes. You can see it.\n(ASIDE) Perhaps you have the full document? Okay.\nQ: BUT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT THEY CALL A CONTINGENCY PLAN, ISN'T IT?\nA: Whatsoever they call it... but that means certainly they want to harm us. Q: WHY DO THEY WANT TO DO THIS?\nA: That you have to ask them.\nQ: WELL, THEY DENY IT. THEY SAY, AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THAT SOME VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS THEY FEEL YOU MAY HAVE CONTRAVENED IN THE OPINIONS OF SOME LAWYERS.\nA: We are in the courts, and we have won almost fifty percent of the cases. The remaining fifty percent we are going to win; because it is so true, they cannot.…\nQ: BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE MATTER, IT SEEMS?\nA: They will appeal if they fail here. Or if we fail, we will appeal. It is not going to end easily.\nQ: BUT SUPPOSING THEY EXHAUST ALL THE LEGAL POSSIBILITIES TO THE SUPREME COURT IN WASHINGTON, AND YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE CASE, DO YOU THEN THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT?\nA: No.\nQ: WHY NOT?\nA: We will then invite them to drop bombs on us and finish us.\nQ: OH, COME ON! I KNOW THE POLICE DID IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT SO I SUPPOSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN DONE.…\nA: That's what I will do: invite them, and finish it. But we are not going to leave this place alive! If they want us to leave this place, they will have to destroy --\nand with it they will have to destroy their mask of democracy, respect for individuality, the Constitution and freedom of expression. All that will go down the drain with Rajneeshpuram.\nAnd it will be a good experiment to do something like Hiroshima. We will enjoy it. We will celebrate it.\nQ: I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK DR. MARGARET SINGER WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT COMMENT YOU JUST MADE. I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT THE SUICIDE, BUT YOU DO HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON WITH REVEREND JIM JONES. HE ALSO SAID, \"WE'LL ASK THE SOVIETS FOR HELP, IF WE NEED IT.\" AND HE WAS REFERRING TO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. DOES THAT BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAY THAT YOU SHARE THAT SAME...?\nA: No. He was a Christian, a Christian priest, and he had a congregation of the most retarded black people. And there is nothing common between me and him.…\nQ: EXCEPT THAT APPEAL TO THE SOVIET UNION.\nA: With that appeal I am saying that we are not going to die so easily as they think. We will fight. Although we are such a small community, we will fight in every possible way. If legal ways are finished, then too we will fight; because basically we know we are being true, and they are being fascist. And we are not afraid, remember -- they are afraid.\nTell that impeccable lady that we are not living in paranoia. The whole of Oregon is living in paranoia: they are afraid. Journalists have been telling me that people are afraid that we are going to take over Oregon. I said, \"Oregon! So small a thing... we will not bother. We would like to take over the whole world.\"\nAnd our way of taking the whole world is totally different; it is not war. I will just go on spreading my red people around the world. We will take it spiritually.\nQ: WELL, AS I SAY, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT YOU TAKE SUCH A GLOOMY VIEW OF THE INTENTIONS OF THE OREGON STATE GOVERNMENT, BUT I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY PLANS THE DEATH OF YOU OR YOUR FOLLOWERS BECAUSE THAT STRIKES ME AS HYPERBOLE, TO SAY THE VERY LEAST.\nA: You don't know what has happened to me in the past, that's why. Attempts on my life have been made in India. I have been given poison, a knife has been thrown at me before ten thousand sannyasins. And it is a miracle that ten thousand sannyasins were eyewitnesses; and because the police got the information that something is coming, they had reached there before the person\nwho was to throw the knife. So there were twenty police officers -- eyewitnesses. Still we lost the case. Ten thousand eyewitnesses, twenty police officers as eyewitnesses; still we lost the case because that man was a Hindu chauvinist and the Maharashtra government is a Hindu chauvinist government.\nQ: BUT ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE ATTEMPTING TO MURDER A POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS LEADER -- AND AFTER ALL, MAHATMA GANDHI WAS ASSASSINATED, WAS HE NOT? -- ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE PLANNED BOMBING OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY SUCH AS YOU HAVE HERE? WHAT WERE YOUR MARIGOLD AND A ROSE AGAIN? -- INCOMPARABLE.\nA: I am saying it because I don't go anywhere; it is very difficult to assassinate me. It was easy in India because I was traveling. It is no longer easy to assassinate me. Because that has become impossible for them, that gives the possibility for them to destroy the whole community with me.\nBut we are not afraid about it -- that you have to remember.\nQ: OH, I HAVE NO DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR RESOLVE; IT'S YOUR REASON THAT BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HATE YOU SO MUCH THAT THEY WANT TO MURDER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE?\nA: Because I am against all the religions, and here, particularly, against Christianity. I am against all the politicians because I think the world has suffered for thousands of years because of the politicians. They are the greatest criminals around. I don't agree with any kind of morality in which they believe. I think it is immoral. I have my own conception of morality. I don't believe in marriage, I think marriage is an ugly institution which has put the whole humanity in a madhouse.\nThe problem is that I stand for totally different values and they are afraid because they have no argument. We have been inviting the Governor, \"Come here. Let us have an open argument.\" He would not come. For four years, he would not come.\nQ: THAT STRIKES ME AS UNREASONABLE, I MUST SAY.\nA: We are ready to have an open discussion. Anybody they can find to stand for their values... I am ready to discuss our values. That seems to be the human way to decide a thing. But none of them is ready to come here. They are in a paranoia; they think anybody who comes here is hypnotized. So, you be aware!\nQ: SHALL WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT? OR DO YOU WISH TO GO? A: No.\nQ: I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ONE THING MORE. I ADMIRED YOUR COMMENT AS QUOTED HERE ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN AND YOUR ARDENT SUPPORT OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL CALL FEMINISM OR EQUALITY. I ALSO SEE A LOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ORGANIZING HERE ARE WOMEN. IS THAT ANOTHER OF THE THINGS THEY PROBABLY HAVE AGAINST YOU?\nA: That too, certainly, because I am against all that man has done to woman. And in my own way I am trying to do a little compensation.\nQ. TO SOMEONE OBSERVING THE VARIOUS VIEWS THAT YOU HAVE -- IT IS QUITE A MIXTURE, BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR VIEWS APPEAR CONSERVATIVE, SOME APPEAR QUITE RADICAL, OTHERS APPEAR REFORMIST/LIBERAL, IF YOU LIKE -- HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO ENCOMPASS SO MANY THINGS WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER? HOW CAN YOU BE ALL THOSE THINGS ALL AT ONCE?\nA: I am not a mediocre thinker. My consciousness is vast enough to contain all, all contradictions, but within me they become complementary to each other. So you can find anything you want in my writings. If you love me, you can find everything that makes your love deeper; if you hate me, you can find everything that makes your hate deeper. I give opportunity to all kinds of people to choose whatever they want to choose. I am vast.\nOkay?\nQ: THANK YOU. I'VE ENJOYED OUR DISCUSSION.\nA: Come again.\nQ: THANK YOU.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #16 Chapter title: The Future Is Always Open 2 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 27.]\nMa Prem Arup\nDE RAJNEESH TIMES AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS\nQUESTION: BHAGWAN, YOU ONCE SAID, \"HOLLAND WILL BE ONE OF MY MOST ORANGE COUNTRIES.\" WHY IS THAT SO?\nANSWER: You can see it already happening. It needs guts to be my red people, and Holland is one of the countries which has existed all through history with tremendous struggle, because the earth level is low and the sea level is higher. Holland has been continuously fighting against the ocean, and it has given a certain strength to the people. Only those who have strength to stand with me can belong to the red commune around the world.\nHolland is certainly going to be my country. My people are continuously growing in Holland.\nYou will be surprised to know the fact that when the theosophical movement decided to declare J. Krishnamurti as the world teacher, Holland was the country chosen for the declaration. Six thousand topmost leaders of the Theosophical Society had gathered there in Holland.\nOut of all the countries, why Holland? There is something very essential that the Dutch people have grown within them; just somebody needs to trigger it. J. Krishnamurti chickened out, could not take that great responsibility. I can take any responsibility without any problem, because basically I am an irresponsible man -- it does not matter.\nBut the Dutch people have grown something in them down the centuries which can have a synchronicity with me; the same with the German people. Germany cannot remain without becoming red, because they have been through two wars which would have destroyed anybody forever; but if you go to Germany now, you cannot believe that this country has survived two world wars -- not only survived, but is now the richest country in Europe. They have some guts.\nI cannot say the same about the French. They are simply lousy. There is no possibility for France. It is doomed; it has no spiritual corner in its being. Yes, a few French people will be coming, those who have still the soul alive in them.\nBut about the whole country this cannot be said. Every country grows in different ways on different lines and gathers a different kind of energy. One of the reasons why Gurdjieff failed and could not help humanity was that he chose France to be his headquarters. Germany would have been of much significance, Holland would have been better, but not France.\nFrance has become satisfied with women and wine. It has no aspirations for something beyond the horizon. It is very limited in its vision and very closed too, because it is a very egoist country. France thinks itself to be the most superior country in the world. Their language is the most superior, their philosophy is the most superior, their paintings are the most superior. These are just ornaments for the ego, and the more a country is surrounded by egoistic projections, the less is the possibility of its transformation.\nOn the other hand, Germany has given birth to the biggest genuises in philosophy, in theology has produced the greatest mystics, but it has no bragging about it. As I have felt people from almost all over the world, I can say certainly that it is hard to bring a German to transformation, hard because he will resist and fight; but if you go on persisting, the day he drops his resistance he is forever yours. Then there is no way back. Then he will never waver. You cannot say that about the American. You can predict that he is going to waver.\nAmerican history is only three hundred years old, and America is not an ancient race. It is not a race at all; it is a hodgepodge. The French are there, the English are there, the Spanish are there, the Portuguese are there, the Italians are there... it is a marketplace. People don't have roots, and to have strength you need roots. The deeper the roots go... yes, it is harder to change you, but once you are changed, it is almost impossible for you to fall back. Once a German is deprogrammed, nobody can reprogram him again. The American can be reprogrammed within two days and you can deprogram him again within two days. He has no roots.\nIn India, we have a certain creeper without roots. It simply lives as a parasite on other trees, from one tree to another tree. It spreads far -- sometimes miles, in the forest -- but it has no roots, it simply lives on those other trees.\nAmericans are simply like that creeper: they don't have any roots; they don't have anything to stand upon, their past is so small. That's why they cannot project about the future either, because this is the logical way: the longer the past, the longer you can project the future.\nThe third world war is just knocking on the doors. This century is going to end, and with the end of this century either we have the new man on the earth or no life at all. But Americans are fast asleep.\nMany Americans have come to me. In almost twenty years, many have come, many have gone, very few have stayed. And those who have stayed are really not Americans. The American Jew has stayed with me, because he has no country; he has only his past, but a long past and of tremendous importance. He knows how to deal with people like Moses, Ezekiel, Jesus, Baal Shem.\nAnd what does America know? Henry Ford, Rockefeller? -- they cannot have a deep intimacy with me.\nYes, a few Americans have remained with me. Mukta is sitting there, but she is not really American, she is Greek. The American generation is just changing continuously -- everything is a fashion. They can come to me also as part of a fashionable movement, but they are not going to remain here, because soon they get attracted to something else. They don't know how to grow roots.\nAnd different countries have different ways. It is not a coincidence that forty percent of my people are Jews. And I have been hitting hard on Jews -- so much so that rabbis have started writing letters to me saying, \"You seem to be anti- Jewish.\" They don't know that Jews are the majority of my people, and I can hit on them because I love them and they understand my love. In my hit, they receive my love.\nNot a single Jew has left me. Once he has come, he has come forever, he has found his Israel in me. He need not go to Jerusalem, he need not bother about Moses and Jesus; there is no need. They have found a more contemporary Moses here.\nEach country can be given a certain characteristic. For example, Indians: they pretend to be spiritualists, and that is the most materialistic country in the whole world, most greedy. They could not be with me for the simple reason that I was exposing them -- and unless I expose you totally, you cannot be reborn.\nIndians started escaping from me the moment I started exposing them. They took the hint, and it was right: they are greedy, they are materialist; they don't have any longing for spirituality, only pretensions. Yes, once, twenty-five centuries ago, perhaps they were spiritual, and that idea of the past has followed them like a shadow. But they forget completely that for twenty-five centuries you cannot go on pretending that the shadow that is following you is alive. Indian spirituality is dead, and I don't see much hope for its revival.\nBut a few Indians have been with me all along, in all the seasons, in all the changes. So when I say something about a country, it does not apply to individuals. Now Avesh is sitting there -- a great Frenchman -- and he is going to sit there forever. I have destroyed his French-ship completely. Arup herself is Dutch. Can she conceive of ever leaving me? Not even in dreams; it is impossible. I can say that with certainty, because love is never uncertain.\nEngland is so sad and depressed -- obviously: they were on the top, they had the biggest empire any country ever had. It was said that the sun never sets in the\nBritish Empire, somewhere or other it is always rising. As far as the whole Empire was concerned, the sun was always rising somewhere; it never set in the British Empire. Neither Alexander, nor Napoleon, nor Hitler, nor Stalin has known such a vast empire. Nobody has been able to know such immense power, and suddenly all that has disappeared like writing on water. It is natural that they will be so depressed, sad. They would not like to come out of their depression. They cannot accept laughing, dancing, singing. They have lost so\nmuch, and you are thinking to dance? They have lost everything, and you are proposing, \"Let us sing a beautiful song!\"\nEngland will find it more difficult than anybody else to be with me. But that does not apply to individuals, let me remind you again. Teertha is there... the moment he entered my room, many years ago, not for a single moment has he left, not even to visit England again. He has dropped his wife, he has dropped his parents, he has dropped everything. He was a well-known encounter leader, he had the best growth institute in Europe; but once he looked into my eyes, all that was finished. I knew it, he knew it -- that he was bound that day and a new life began which had nothing to do with the past.\nIndividuals will be coming from everywhere, but a few countries have more potential. For example, it is very difficult to get into the Mohammedan countries\n-- almost impossible, because they are still so uncivilized. Civilization has not happened anywhere, but there are countries which are a little less uncivilized and there are countries which are more uncivilized. Civilization is still waiting to happen. It is waiting to happen for you: you are to become the heralds of civilization.\nBut Mohammedan countries are not even contemporaries. They have not moved a single inch from the times of Mohammed. Fourteen centuries have passed and they are still thinking that the Koran is the holy book. In the Koran ninety-nine percent is just nonsense. One percent you can manage to give some spiritual meaning, with great effort, otherwise it is not of any importance. And Mohammedans have remained faithful to the Koran. They are not ready even to listen to anybody.\nA few Mohammedans are my sannyasins, but those poor people ask me, \"Bhagwan, we want to be sannyasins, we want to be contemporaries, we want to have the revolution that you are giving us, but we cannot go in red clothes back home. They will simply kill... they don't argue.\"\nMohammedans don't know argument. They don't know any philosophy. Their only argument is the sword: either kill them, or be killed by them; whosoever is killed was wrong. That is strange. It is very easy to kill Socrates, any idiot like Muhammad Ali can kill Socrates without any difficulty. Socrates is not a wrestler, he is not a boxer; just a good punch on his nose and he will be finished with all his philosophy. Physical strength or strength that comes through weapons cannot be a substitute for argument. Argument needs intelligence, and that intelligence is missing there.\nIn India, I had come in contact with hundreds of Mohammedans. You may not know that India is still the biggest Mohammedan country in the world as far as numbers are concerned, even after the division with Pakistan. When Pakistan and Bangladesh were one with India, of course, half the population of Mohammedans was in India. But even after Pakistan was separated, Bangladesh got separated, still India had a larger Mohammedan population than any other\ncountry. Countries which are completely Mohammedan -- even they are far behind.\nThese Mohammedans in India are a little better than any Mohammedans in any other country because for centuries they have been living with all kinds of philosophers, all kinds of religions, all kinds of attitudes, approaches. Obviously their fanaticism has become less, but even that fanaticism is enough to kill you. You cannot say anything against one holy book -- and that is Koran; one God -- and that is that of Islam; and one prophet -- and that is Mohammed. In these three statements, the whole Mohammedanism is complete. You cannot speak against any of these three... and there is so much to say against all these three.\nThe Mohammedan God does not look like a God at all, their holy book is just rubbish, and their one and only one prophet is just an uneducated, uncultured man, with no idea of philosophical heights, with no knowledge of anything, who has never meditated in his life. He knows nothing about meditation.\nBut the sannyasins who are Mohammedans have asked me, \"Give us permission. We will keep the mala hidden in our houses, we will keep the robe\nhidden in our houses, we cannot even let our family know about it because that will be just the end. And if you want,\" they have told me, \"that we should be killed, we are ready.\"\nNow, I am not a fanatic about the color of the dress or the mala. I said, \"Don't be worried about it. I need your heart, and if that has become red.… I need to be within you. If I have reached there, then don't be worried. And I don't want anybody to be killed in my name, I want people to live longer, healthier, happier in my name.\"\nMohammed says to Mohammedans, \"If you die in my name, your paradise is certain.\" I say to you, \"If you live in my name and love in my name and dance in my name, you are already in paradise.\" I don't guarantee anything about the future, how can I tell anybody to die in my name?\nThe earth is so small and it is divided in so many different groups who have grown differently, had different histories -- and their past is significant, that has to be taken into account. So, whenever I have said anything about Holland, or Germany, or England, I was simply indicating the possibility.\nI have so many Italians -- but not reliable; well greased and slippery! They try hard, nice people, but what can they do about their greasiness? Some thing in them is always slippery. Many Italians have come to me, very few have stayed. Those who have stayed have changed a lot, but still something of greasiness is there. Now they are not going to slip back, but the possibility remains. they are\nnot absolutely out of it.\nBut if we can get the right people, the people who are not that ripe may start following them. That's how the human mind functions; it is imitative. If we have enough red people around the earth, then more and more Italians will slip into being red people. Slipperiness has no direction, you just have to give them the right place from where to slip.\nAnd if we can create a rejoicing around the world, how long can England remain depressed? Nobody wants to be depressed. How long can they go on singing \"God Save the King\"? And what about them? God only saves the queen or the king? -- what about the people? God has not been in favor of the people.\nThose people are waiting for something to happen in the world that can drag them out of their gloominess, their depressiveness, and can make them free, free of the glory that they had of the empire, which they are missing.\nWe can give them a new glory which nobody can take away from them. That glory that they had was really ugly: exploiting people, poor people all around the world -- and your whole joy was dependent on these starving people, and you went on exploiting them. If you are sad and depressed today, it is the consequence of your own actions. You have made millions of people sad, depressed, you have killed millions of people around the world to save the empire; now who is going to suffer the consequences?\nEngland is now a dark hole. That does not mean that people want to live in that dark hole, but we have to make an effort to reach into their darkness with our torches, we have to throw ropes into that dark hole. Somebody is bound to catch hold of the rope and we can pull him out. And it is a question only of a few people starting moving, and others may follow.\nSo in every country we have to work in a different way, seeing the country's characteristic. Now we have communes all around the world. Every commune has to understand what kind of people you are surrounded with, and what can be done so that they can be pulled within you. It is simple arithmetic.\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WERNER ERHARD, THE BUSINESSMAN WHO DISCOVERED THAT PERSONAL GROWTH SELLS BETTER THAN ENCYCLOPEDIAS, YOU SAID THAT THE BUSINESS OF GROWTH IS JUST AN AMERICAN NAME FOR GOD.\nTHE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER CHRONICLE, REPORTING THIS, NOTED THAT YOU DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PERSONAL GROWTH MARKETING OF YOUR OWN RAJNEESH INTERNATIONAL MEDITATION UNIVERSITY HERE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AND WHAT PART DOES THE UNIVERSITY PLAY IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNE?\nA: The difference is great. He was a door-to-door salesman of encyclopedias. Our university is not going door-to-door to sell anything to anybody.\nOur university is a well. Those who are thirsty can come and drink out of it. It is available, but we are not persuading anybody. On the contrary, I am making every effort to offend them, to make them angry, become our enemies. Do you think this is business tactics?\nIn business, the customer is always right. Here the situation is totally different: the customer is always wrong. From whatsoever source he comes, he is always wrong -- and he comes on his own, in spite of all that I go on doing continuously\nto prevent him from coming. Nobody in the whole world has offended so many people as I alone have done, singlehandedly.\nBut even after all this turmoil that I create, and offensiveness and antagonism in their minds, a few daring people come. These people can be relied upon. Just their coming is significant. Certainly, my university is not part of the marketplace.\nWerner Erhard was part of the market world. He was taking his est from one hotel to another hotel around the country, then outside the country. And he was neither a philosophical man, nor religious; he had registered est as a corporation, a business corporation. He was paying income tax for all his incomes.\nOur university is not a business. We don't have to pay any taxes for the university. The degrees that our university gives are of no use in the marketplace, because we don't want our degrees to be recognized by any government or by any university or any other institution. We refuse to be recognized by them, because just the fact that we let them recognize us means they are somebody higher than us, somebody more authoritative. We don't accept any government's recognition, because no government is worthy of it.\nOur university is absolutely a free phenomenon. Those who want to come, come knowing that whatever we have to offer is of no use in the marketplace. In fact it may make their market world more difficult for them, because a person who comes here for three months or four months to do a course in the university... we are not giving him growth the way Werner Erhard was giving. He started from where you are.\nOur work is first to destroy whosoever you are -- whosoever, without any condition. We destroy you first, dismantle you first, and unless we have deprogrammed you completely there is no growth possible. We don't teach you any growth. To be deprogrammed... you start growing on your own accord. Werner Erhard was teaching you techniques of growth, but if you are a monster and you are being taught techniques of growth, you will become a bigger monster.\nWerner Erhard never offended anybody. That's simply the way of the businessman: never offend anybody. Everybody was happy with him. The government was happy, the churches were happy, the politicians were happy -- not only in this country, but in other countries too. He used to go to India to pay respect to the so-called Hindu mahatmas. Muktananda was his guru. He even went to pay his respects to Morarji Desai, when he was the prime minister of India. And by mistake he even came to me, thinking I also belong to the same category of mahatmas that he has known all his life. He must have been shocked. When he was sitting in front of me, I could see how difficult it was for him just to sit there. And when I told him he can ask anything, he simply said, \"No, I don't have any questions.\" Laxmi had given him my latest books, just as a present. He went into the hotel -- which was not far away, just a few minutes walk -- and gave those books to one sannyasin, Hridaya, without even looking at them. Some\ngreat fear must have arisen in him. Reading those books might disturb his mind. And certainly I was not the person that he had expected. I would have destroyed his whole est first.\nI have to begin from scratch. First I have to demolish the old building completely, I don't believe in renovation. Howsoever beautifully you renovate a building, it still remains the old rotten thing; just painted here and there, a little bit supported, but it is just the old rotten building that you have given a facelift. No, it is better to live in an A-frame, but new, fresh, young.\nWerner Erhard is a businessman, there are no two opinions about it. And nobody can compare me with Werner Erhard. Our whole approach is totally different.\nOur approach is first to deprogram the person completely, and then leave him alone to himself. Don't give him another program. Leave him alone, empty, just a pure nothingness. And out of that nothingness grows everything that existence wanted to grow in that man.\nWe bring the person close to existence, from where he has been taken away. Once we see that you are communing with existence, our work is finished. We don't give you growth, we simply take away all nonsense that is surrounding you and which perhaps you think is growth. Growth comes of its own accord, you just have to be utterly open and vulnerable.\nI am not a businessman. I could have been and then I would have defeated all the businessmen in the whole world. But I have chosen to offend everybody, ready for their hostility from every nook and corner of the world.\nA businessman tries to be respectable, and I have been trying my whole life to be notorious. Unless you understand me, you will not be able to see why I unnecessarily create hostility in people. I am not a businessman. I have nothing to sell to them. If they are courageous enough to come nearer to me, I am going to burn their whole personality. I'm going to take their whole skin off their body and then leave them alone so they can grow fresh from the very beginning.\nThat growth will not be in any way a credit to me. That growth will be a credit to the person who dared to come, who dared to pass through the fire, who dared to risk his whole life. The whole credit goes to him.\nQ: BHAGWAN, GOING BACK TO HOLLAND: YOUR COMMUNE IN HOLLAND WAS LIVING IN A PRISON AND NOW HAS MOVED INTO A MONASTERY. IS THIS PROGRESS? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM HAVING A DISCO IN A CHURCH NEXT?\nA: That's great. I want discos in all the churches and cathedrals and all the mosques and all the temples around the world. They are the best places for disco. So this is a great advance, that they have turned a church into a disco! That's what I want.\nAnd if they have moved to the monastery, for the first time the monastery will have real people, not hypocrites, in it. For the first time, the monastery will hear\nlaughter and singing and dancing and people loving each other. The monastery may have seen monks who were simply monsters and nothing else. Now the monastery will see what really the word monk means and what is the meaning of being a monastery.\nThe word monk means one who is capable of being himself, individual, alone, independent. That is the meaning of the monk: alone. It has nothing to do with Christianity. You will recognize the word in other words: monogamy, monopoly\n-- it is the same word. Monk, monastery... MONASTERY means people living there totally independent, completely free from any strings and yet they have one thing in common: that they all want to be alone and individuals. This is the common factor that keeps them together.\nSo it is good that our commune in Holland has moved into a monastery. We will make it a real monastery because my people are real monks, and the monastery will be really celebrating. My people, even if you give them a graveyard, are going to make a carnival there. The graves will become tables for drinking wine. They will soon turn the graveyard into such a beautiful place that you would never imagine that thousands of dead bodies are under the ground.\nThe actual fact is, wherever you are sitting, at least ten persons' dead bodies are on that spot underneath you. So many millions of people have lived down the millions of years, it has been calculated that not a single inch on the earth is not a graveyard. And for all these people who have lived on the earth and died, this is the minimum -- that on every spot at least eight persons are buried deep down.\nSo there is no problem: when we can make any place a place of joy, we can change a graveyard into a joy. Just inquire of those people. Because it happens\noften that by the side of the churches there are graveyards, by the side of the monastery there are graveyards. If there are graveyards, transform them into dancing places, playing grounds; fill them with laughter and joy. Perhaps those who are buried there will have for the first time a time which they never had in their life. It is just great.\nQ: DO YOU THINK SOME OF THOSE GHOSTS MIGHT STILL BE KICKING AROUND UNDERNEATH?\nA: There are no ghosts. There was only one ghost -- the holy ghost -- and he too finished only by making a poor girl pregnant. Then what happened to the holy ghost? He must have committed suicide, thinking of the consequences that followed his making the woman pregnant, which was illegal, criminal, irreligious, a sin.\nSecondly, out of that sin, what else can you expect but Jesus Christ? People had to crucify him. Seeing his son being crucified, do you think the holy ghost would have survived? Since then, nothing has been heard about him. No news. the\nVatican is silent.\nThere are no ghosts, there are only dead skeletons underneath. The soul goes on moving to new forms. It depends how you have lived. Your whole life essence determines your new form. What you have desired your whole life and have not been able to fulfill, that desire at the last moment of your life stands as the only thing that determines your life. There is nobody directing anything, it is simply the law.\nFor example, a man goes on writing to me -- obviously he's from California. It is so difficult to find anything right in California. The man goes on writing to me that he loves to dress himself in women's dresses. When he was in California, there was no problem. There are many who are doing that and they are doing it perfectly. It is very difficult to detect that this is a man -- with tits and all!\nBut here he finds it difficult, because everybody knows he is a man. So he goes on asking me what he should do: \"Should I go through plastic surgery and become a woman?'\nNow, this man if he dies will become a woman. That is his whole mind, full of only one desire: to become a woman. And it is my experience that this is not an exceptional case, this is the rule. Men get tired in seventy years' life of being men, and every man thinks women are more juicy, enjoying life more, and he has been simply sucked of all his energy.\nAnd the woman her whole life goes on thinking that, as a woman, whatsoever she is going to do, she is not going to be really equal to man. Liberation or no liberation, man is going to dominate her. The woman carries the desire to be a man, and my experiments with many people about their past lives even surprised me in the beginning, because the man was a woman in the past life, the woman was a man in the past life. For many lives you have been human beings, man or woman.\nBut if we go deeper, you have been animals. If you go still deeper, you have been plants -- but that is millions of lives back. The whole physiological, biological evolution stopped at man. This whole growth up to now was horizontal. At this point, man has come to a crossroad. He can go on horizontally, changing man to woman, woman to man, but there is no growth. Now he has to take a vertical route, not horizontal. And that vertical route is my whole effort.\nMeditation is a way of giving you a vertical route. Then there is no need to be reborn. Bodies move horizontally, souls have wings. Once you are fully alert, aware, conscious, enlightened, then this is your last body, because only bodies can move on the horizontal line. Now you are a soul. You will have to move vertically.\nBut what a joy! Not to have a cage of bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerve system, a skull. Sometimes it is good experience to go to a medical college and\nsee a skeleton: this is you, really naked. Not only the clothes are removed. he\nhas gone too far; he has removed everything. Just bones, just the fundamental structure is there, and everything else has been removed.\nOnce in a while, standing before a mirror, just close your eyes and think that you are a skeleton. Then open your eyes and look into the mirror. Try to figure out what kind of skeleton you have. That's why I say you should first see a few skeletons. I suggest to Vedant and Siddha that in the university you should have a few skeletons hanging around all over the place, so nobody can bypass -- and that will prove also that this is not a marketplace, and everybody has to understand that this is your reality. When the soul is free from all bondage, it moves into the cosmos, it becomes one with the sky, with the sunrise, with the flowers, with the birds, with all that exists. It spreads all over. It has no more any limitations, it is as big and vast as the whole universe itself. That's what I call liberation. That is the end, because nothing is more blissful, more ecstatic, than to achieve it.\nQ: BHAGWAN, EARLIER ON YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND YOU WERE JUST TALKING NOW ABOUT THE LAST DESIRE AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH, SO IF SOMEONE GETS REBORN INTO SOME NATIONALITY, DOES THAT WHOLE NATIONAL HISTORY BECOME PART OF THE BODY, OF THE MIND, OR HOW DOES IT CONNECT?\nA: Mostly it never happens, or very rarely. A Dutch is born again in Holland; a Hindu goes on again and again being a Hindu, because his whole conditioning can be adjusted in a Hindu environment. Perhaps, rarely.… I have yet to come across a person who was something else in his past life; now he is an Italian, and in the past life he was a German. People go on being born in the same race, in the same atmosphere. The only change that happens is from man to woman.\nPerhaps my people will find it difficult where to be reborn, because now they don't belong to any race and they don't belong to any country. But don't be afraid, we have so many sannyasins throughout the world, you can get born as a sannyasin somewhere -- and there are a few sannyasin women, sannyasin men, who want children. But I have not come across a case where somebody is born from Tibet into India, or from India into China. It is unnatural. The soul flows in the same rut to which it has become accustomed.\nThere are many cases in India of small children remembering their past lives. It happens only in India, for the simple reason that that is the only country that believes in rebirth. Christians believe in only one birth, Jews believe in only one birth, Mohammedans believe in only one birth. It is only the religions born in India who say that there are thousands of births. It is a long process -- seventy years is not enough for a sleeping person to be awakened. He needs more time.\nThey believe it; I know it.\nIt is certainly true; it is not a hypothesis. But I don't want you to believe it, because for you it will not be a truth. I would like you to explore. Go back into your past lives -- it is really a tremendous trick, just terrific -- and as you go\nbackwards, you are simply amazed what kind of person you are and how many forms you have taken before. And this is a great help, to understand that no form has been a contentment to you. From every form you have died in discontent and despair, so now don't miss the chance of moving vertically.\nIt is good for animals to move horizontally. Ordinarily, they also move horizontally, and it is symbolical, really significant. The only animal on the earth standing, against gravitation -- walking on four is easier because it is not against gravitation, the force of gravitation is equally distributed all over the body-you are also vertical, just as gravitation is vertical. That's why in sleep you find so much relaxation, because in sleep you become horizontal. You get tired standing up, sitting long; then you need lying down.\nHow does that lying down bring you relaxation, rejuvenation? Just being in tune with gravitation. Standing, you are really doing a miracle. You are against gravitation, which pulls everything down, and your heart has to pump blood into your head, upwards. It is a miracle that you are performing every second. Your heart is really a rebel, a revolution against gravitation. It is forcing blood upwards.\nIt is now a well-established fact why animals have not been able to grow brains: for the simple reason that they are horizontal. In their heads, blood flows so much that the necessary small cells which constitute your brain-seven million cells in your small skull -- are so small that in that flood of blood they cannot survive. They cannot be born, either.\nJust because man stood on two legs and the head became against gravitation, a very small blood flow reaches to the head and the head can grow a very delicate system of nerves, a delicate combination of cells. But for that a very small and silent flow of blood is needed.\nThat's why I'm against anybody doing the headstand posture of yoga. More than three seconds is dangerous; your brain cells cannot stand too much blood coming to them for more than three seconds. And you can see the result: not a single Hindu yogi has contributed anything to the world. Those yogis are standing on their heads, they destroy their brain, and the brain is the necessary instrument to create anything. The Hindu yogis have been the most uncreative people in the world, they have been just the parasites of our society.\nSo, anybody who is interested in standing on the head, it is really a good exercise\n-- but only for three seconds. Then just be back on your feet. It is good because it refreshes your mind: just a sudden shower of blood and the whole mind is refreshed. All the dead cells will go back when you jump again to your feet, the blood returning back to the body will itself take all dead cells that were hanging around in your head. The exercise is good, but exact timing... nobody should do it more than three seconds.\nSo, people are continuously born into the same culture, except a few exceptional people -- travelers, nomads, who don't have any home, who don't have any\nattachment, who may be born into some new environment. And that's from where the trouble child is born.\nYou know the word problem child. It is not the child's decision to make any trouble, but he is a misfit, he does not belong to your heritage, your conditions, your past. He has some other past, some other conditions, and there is going to be a clash between the parents and the child. Most probably the parents are going to prevail, they will destroy the child's heritage and force him to belong to them, to their race, to their religion.\nBut these children who are born into a different race, into a different country, for some reason, are really very valuable. Any problem child is a very valuable phenomenon. If we allow him freedom to grow, he will bring new richness to your race, to your country. He will introduce something that your race has never known. These children prove to be the geniuses.\nAnd vice versa: you can look into the lives of your geniuses and you will always find in their childhood their parents had as much trouble with them as human beings can tolerate. All geniuses are a trouble in their childhood, and any child who is not a trouble in his childhood is going to do all kinds of businesses -- Werner Erhard and all kinds of shops and marketplaces -- but he cannot be a genius. It is difficult... he is burdened with his own past, and his parents have burdened him with their past. He is in a kind of split.\nPerhaps this will give some insight to you about schizophrenia. Why do some people suffer from schizophrenia? Because from two different directions two conditions meet in them, but they cannot mix and become one, they remain two. Sometimes one is up and the person starts speaking in a different way, behaving in a different way; another time the other is up and the person behaves so diametrically opposite to his normal behavior that all you can do is take him to the psychiatrist. You start thinking he is sick.\nHe is not sick, he is simply suffering because two long traditions have met in him. All that he needs is to be a witness of both the conditionings and separate himself, disidentify himself from both the conditionings, and the whole schizophrenia will disappear.\nIn fact, the moment he disidentifies himself from both the conditions, he will have a richness that you cannot have, because he can use from both the conditions, both the heritages, things which he wants. He is now the master.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #17 Chapter title: You Are Alive 3 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 28.]\nWillem Sheer PERS UNIE THE HAGUE,\nNETHERLANDS\nQUESTION: I HAVE BEEN READING YOUR BOOKS FOR SOME YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN SEEING SOME VIDEOS OF YOU. AND I WAS HERE LAST WINTER AT THE WINTER FESTIVAL. AND ONE WEEK AGO AT THE OFFICE I GOT A TELEPHONE CALL FROM BHAGAWATI WHO ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU. SO HERE I AM. I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 QUESTIONS. AND I CHOSE ABOUT TWENTY... I SELECTED ABOUT TWENTY OUT OF THEM.\nANSWER: Good, let's start.\nQ: MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE: BHAGWAN, I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN A CLIMATE OF CRITICAL JOURNALISM. I AM TAUGHT AS A JOURNALIST NEVER TO BELIEVE ANYONE ON HIS WORD. ARE YOU CAPABLE TO COMMUNICATE YOUR MESSAGE TO SUSPICIOUS JOURNALISTS? OR IS TRUST NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN?\nA: No. No faith, no belief, no trust is needed. And what you have been taught as a journalist, to be critical, skeptical, is exactly my message. Be critical, be skeptical. Go on saying no until you can find the yes which you cannot deny.\nMy people are not people who have gathered here because of a certain faith or belief. They are inquirers, seekers with open minds, and they are being taught only one thing: never accept anything unless you can experience it. Critical journalism is just third rate, because it is only the mind, the reason. But the mind and reason can be very easily defeated. Just a little sharper intelligence is needed and your criticism will be gone.\nBut the criticism I am teaching to my people is something far deeper and far wider. I am teaching them not to argue about truth, because there is no way through argument to reach the truth. Whenever two arguments fight, all that is\nproved is who was more capable of arguing. Truth is never proved that way, truth has to be experienced. So deny every belief and deny it absolutely. Not even a lingering shadow of belief should be within you.\nQ: SO YOUR SANNYASINS ALSO SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY?\nA: They are.\nQ: AND WHEN YOU SAY, \"DO THIS AND THAT AND THIS WILL BE THE RESULT,\" THEN THEY ENTER IT WITH A SKEPTICAL, CRITICAL MIND?\nA: Certainly. Whatever I say to them is hypothetical, just the way science works. A scientist enters into an experiment with a hypothesis. Hypothesis means not belief, but just that one has to begin somewhere, so for the moment he accepts a certain concept and enters into it with absolute alertness so that he is not deceived by his own hypothesis. He has to be aware that it is only a hypothesis and not a truth.\nQ: BUT YOU ALSO SAID, \"TRUST ME, FOLLOW ME.\"\nA: That is said to those people who have arrived. I have been speaking to millions of people. And when I speak to a person, I cannot take account of the whole world. My statement is direct and immediate and personal. When I have said to somebody, \"Trust and follow me,\" that means the person has arrived. Now there is no need of any skepticism, no negativity. Now there is no need for him to unnecessarily harass himself, he has done enough. But not before that.\nQ: SO TRUST IS A LATER STATE?\nA: Yes.\nQ: MAY I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION? I BELONG TO THE DIMINISHING MINORITY OF DUTCH PEOPLE WHO REGARD THE HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A WONDERFUL INSTITUTE IN WHICH A LOT OF WISDOM CAN BE FOUND. AT THE SAME TIME I ENJOY YOUR BOOKS AND VIDEOS. IS THIS A PARADOX, AND IF SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT?\nA: It is a paradox and you know exactly what has to be done about it. If you could have left me, you would have left. You cannot leave me. So the paradox is dissolved: Catholicism is finished.\nQ: I MEET IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PERSONS WHOM I SINCERELY EXPERIENCE AS SINCERE. AND I HAVE OFTEN READ THAT FOR EXAMPLE MOTHER TERESA... YOU MOCK HER A LOT. I ONCE MET HER MYSELF AND I FOUND HER A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. WHEN I ASKED HER, \"SHOULD CHRISTIANS CONVERT PEOPLE OF OTHER RELIGIONS TO CHRISTIANITY?\" SHE ANSWERED, \"NO, LET EVERYBODY GO HIS OWN WAY. YOU GO YOUR WAY TO GOD, I GO MY WAY. \" AND I FOUND HER A SINCERE WOMAN, AS FAR AS I CAN EXPERIENCE.\nA: First, there are sincere people in every religion, but groping in the dark. So if you meet in the Catholic Church sincere seekers, it is your duty to bring them out of the Catholic Church, because there they are not going to find what they are seeking. A seeker cannot seek if he is surrounded by dogma, by a certain attitude about reality -- and that too, two thousand years old, out of date, out of existence. Those Catholic Churches are just graveyards. Those people may be seekers and sincere. Tell them, \"You are searching in a graveyard. Come where life is. Come where dance is. Come where the fresh wind is blowing. In this stale, closed Catholic Church, you are going to get suffocated and die, you are not going to find it.\"\nBecause they are sincere, that's why you have to be sincere with them too. They need respect -- but not only respect; they also need a shock so that they can wake up and come out of the boundaries of Catholicism, or Protestantism or Hinduism or Mohammedanism -- that doesn't matter. My work here is to bring everybody out of his prison; what the name of the prison is does not matter.\nThe person who wants to know the truth has to be completely deprogrammed. He should not have any belief, he should not have any religion, he should not have any nation, he should not have any race, he should be just a simple human being. From there, with that innocence, like a child, he has to start.\nQ: IT SEEMS, BHAGWAN, WHEN YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER -- WHEN YOU ARE A COMPLETE OUTSIDER -- IT SEEMS THAT RAJNEESHISM ALSO IS A PRISON. I WENT INTO IT A LITTLE BIT AND I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE CLEAR TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS IS IN FACT AN ANTI-CHURCH?\nA: Just wait, let me first finish your question completely. I cannot leave Mother Teresa alone. So whenever Mother Teresa comes in, please don't change the subject.\nYou say she is a beautiful woman. I have no disagreement about it. But what she said to you is not beautiful -- that you follow your path, I follow my path. This is not compassion. If I see you following on a wrong path I will try every effort to obstruct you from going there, and I will try to convince you that what you are doing is wrong. That is compassion.\nAnd all the paths are not right. There are three hundred religions in the world. All three hundred religions are not right. This is nice to say that you follow your path, I follow my path and everybody follows his path, but that means Mother Teresa does not know at all what is right. This can be said only by an ignorant person. If I know what is right, I also know what is wrong, and I will make every effort to prevent you if you move on the wrong path. To me that will be compassion. You got influenced by the old woman.…\nQ: I THINK SO, A BIT.…\nA:... But things are not as they appear. She goes on converting orphans into the Catholic Church. The orphan may be a Mohammedan, may be a Hindu, may be a Jaina, may be a Buddhist. She does not think those orphans should follow their path. Just because she has been feeding them, she has purchased them for the Catholic Church. She wants more and more orphans, she wants more and more poverty, because without poverty and without orphans, the number of Catholics cannot increase.\nIt is power politics, the politics of numbers. And when you look deep down into the whole thing, you will not say that she is a beautiful woman. She is a politician and her answer was diplomatic. It consoled you, that you go on your path, I go on my path. It gave you certain strength, but that strength is going to be given to your ego. I cannot say, \"You go on your path.\" You don't know what your path is, where you are going. I know there is only one path, there are not many paths.\nSo the man of compassion will try in every way to persuade you, to convince you; rationally he will make the effort. And if there is a possibility of an open heart, he will make a heart to heart contact too. When somebody is drowning and you are standing on the bank of the river, you don't say, \"You go on your path and I am going on my path.\" Do you think that is beautiful? You have to jump and save that man who is drowning.\nAnd now Catholics need to be saved. Jesus started saving people, although he could not save himself; and for two thousand years these people are trying to save people. They have not been able to save anybody. On the contrary, they have been fighting crusades, burning people alive. These are the saviors of man. And if Mother Teresa has any intelligence left -- I suspect not, but if she has any intelligence left, the first thing would be to get out of the Catholic Church.\nQ: AND BECOME A SANNYASIN.…\nA: Certainly. Because I can say on my own authority that I can save her. She cannot say on her own authority anything. She can quote the dead Bible, she can quote Jesus Christ. I am not quoting anybody. I am saying it myself.\nQ: AND YOUR PATH IS OBJECTIVE?\nA: Absolutely objective.\nQ:AND ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWS YOUR PATH FINDS THIS TRUTH?\nA: Certainly.\nQ: MAY I PASS TO ANOTHER QUESTION?\nA: Is Mother Teresa finished...? Pass on.\nQ: READING YOUR DISCOURSES, BHAGWAN, ONE MEETS WITH CONTRADICTIONS CONSTANTLY. I DID NOT STUDY ALL YOUR BOOKS OF COURSE, BUT BASING MYSELF ON THE ONES I DID READ, I THINK THERE ARE NOT MANY STATEMENTS OF YOURS WHICH ARE NOT COUNTERED BY OTHER STATMENTS. AM I RIGHT THAT YOU CONSTANTLY UNDERMINE YOUR OWN TEACHINGS? WHAT IS THE UNCHANGING NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION?\nA: You are right. I am a man of contradictions; and my understanding is that only idiots are consistent. The higher your intelligence, the more contradictions will be in your life, because you are constantly growing, expanding. Every day new facts arise in your consciousness, and then the question arises to go with the reality that has been revealed today or just to remain consistent with your past, dead statements.\nI am not such a coward as your philosophers and theologians are. I don't bother about anything that I have said, ever. My whole concern is this moment. If it contradicts my whole life, it is perfectly okay, there is no harm, it is good. And I am not saying that I will remain tomorrow with the same statement. Tomorrow will bring its own light, tomorrow will bring its own experience, and only tomorrow will decide what statement I am going to make.\nQ: BUT IS THERE AN UNCHANGEABLE NUCLEUS, THEN, IN YOUR VISION?\nA: Yes, my consciousness, my awareness. But that you cannot find in the books. That you can find only in yourself.\nI am absolutely alert. Whatsoever I am saying, I am not saying according to some dogma, according to my own philosophy up to this moment. No, I am simply responding to this moment, to you. And I don't care about anything else for the moment. I am a man who lives moment to moment. And whatsoever happens in the moment, I am available to it.\nQ: AM I WRONG WHEN I SAY, WHEN I TRY TO DESCRIBE YOUR NUCLEUS, THE NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION, AS CELEBRATING LIFE?\nA: No, that is just a by-product. The nucleus is consciousness, absolute consciousness. Out of it many things will be there: celebration of life, love, laughter. Out of it so many branches and so many flowers... but the nucleus remains consciousness. And that I have never contradicted in my whole life. I cannot, because whatsoever I have said, I have said with full consciousness. But that was in that moment.\nFor example, I may fall in love with a woman, and in that moment I may say to the woman that I will love her forever. And I am not cheating, I am not deceiving; that's my response in that moment, and I am absolutely clear about it. But that does not mean that tomorrow I will not change. I am not saying that I will never change; I am simply stating my response to the moment. The next moment nobody knows what will happen, and the next moment I will not find myself chained by my own past.\nSo my approach is to go on dying to the past moment continuously so that you can be alive in the new moment that is coming. Death to the past, life to the present. And the future is going to come to you as present, never as past.\nQ: THAT MEANS, I THINK, TRY TO LIVE WITHOUT TRADITION.\nA: Certainly.\nQ: AND NOW MY QUESTION IS: THIS IDEA THAT YOU TRIED TO DESCRIBE OF LIVING OUT OF THE FULLNESS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND IN THIS MOMENT, HERE AND NOW -- IS THIS IDEA NOT ALSO A PRODUCT OF TRADITION?\nA: No, because nobody has said it before. No tradition exists around this idea. Buddha was very consistent. Forty-two years' teaching... you cannot find a single contradiction. In Buddha, Mohammed, you cannot find any contradiction. In Jesus you cannot find any contradiction either. These people lived according to a certain dogma. They were prisoners.\nI am a free bird with no cage around me. And I want to break all the cages of everybody, so the whole sky is yours. Sometimes it is sunrise, sometimes it is sunset. Sometimes it is day and sometimes it is night. Things go on changing in existence, and a man of consciousness remains in harmony with existence, with the continuous flux of existence. My statements in the past are as dead as I am to the past.\nQ: BUT WE ARE ALL STILL READING THE BOOKS YOU SPOKE IN THE PAST. IS THAT SENSELESS THEN?\nA: It is significant. But don't trust those books against my present. Perhaps reading them you may be able to understand what I am saying now. All those contradictions and all those books will help you to understand my present state and my present statement about existence. That is their only use. If you can understand it without them, burn them. There is no need of all those books.\nI have never read any of my books, and I am not ever going to look at them -- because past is past, gone is gone, and I don't live in a graveyard. Only dead people can be consistent, because they cannot contradict anymore. I am alive, and I am going to be alive to the very last breath of my life. My last breath will also be a statement, perhaps contradicting all that I have done and said before, so wait.\nQ: SO, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE THAT AT THE END YOU WOULD SAY, THE VERY NOTION OF ENLIGHTENMENT -- FORGET IT!\nA: I can. I can say anything, I am so free. Don't you see the beauty of freedom? You can say anything, you can live anything. There is no bondage on me. At the last moment I can say, \"All this business of enlightenment is simply bullshit. Forget all about it\" -- and perhaps a few people may get enlightened only when I say that.\nNobody can make a dogma out of me; nobody can be a pope after me, because he will be in so much trouble. Nobody can be a successor to me because he will not be able to manage all the contradictions, thousands of contradictions.\nQ: SO THE ONLY NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION IS BHAGWAN HIMSELF\nA: Certainly. I am the center of my circus and when I am gone, who bothers what happens to the circus?\nQ: YOU SAID JUST A MOMENT AGO, \"I WANT TO SHOCK PEOPLE AWAKE.\" AND I HAVE THE FEELING THAT VERY OFTEN YOU SHOCK WITH SUCH A HEAVINESS THAT YOU PROVOKE A LOT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST YOURSELF, AGAINST YOUR SANNYASINS. IS THIS PRICE WORTHWHILE?\nA: It is absolutely necessary -- no question of its worthwhileness. I want their hostility, I want their aggressiveness, because their hostility and their aggressiveness is going to work in two ways. If my sannyasins are simply ignored, nobody takes any offense, that simply means I have nothing to offer to the world, no contribution, nothing new. It can be ignored. The only thing that I\nhate is to be ignored. Be aggressive -- that I accept, because at least a certain relationship has started happening between me and the person who is aggressive.\nHostility is emotional and the beauty of the whole game is that the hostile person is burning himself. I am not hostile; I have simply triggered something in him and he is burning himself.\nAnd nobody can remain hostile for long. It is a sickness. He has to find some way out of it. Either he has to forget all about me -- which is impossible because I have hurt him so deeply.… Neither can he forgive me nor forget me -- the only possible way is to come close to me and try to understand what I am doing. \"Is it really right for me to be hostile to these people? Is it right for me to be so full of hate with these people?\" And anybody who comes closer is going to change. This has been happening every day.\nIn Ahmedabad a man came and fell at my feet. I said, \"What is the matter?\" He was crying. He pulled out a big knife and he said, \"I had come to kill you because what I have heard about you, that you are destroying the whole tradition of Hinduism, made me so angry, but when I heard you something suddenly changed in me. I could see that you are not interested in destroying any tradition. You are simply interested in helping people to find the truth, and if something has to be demolished on the way, removed from the way so the person can reach to the truth, you are doing that.\" And he wanted to be initiated into sannyas.\nHate can very easily turn into love, just as love can turn into hate. They are two sides of the same coin.\nSo it is with full awareness that I am continuously creating enemies around the world. I don't want anybody to go on sleeping without being disturbed. Perhaps a few of them may wake up. Most of them will take a turn, pull over their blanket and go to sleep again, but that is not my responsibility. If out of a hundred even one person wakes up and sees what has happened, that my hit over his head was not against him but was against his sleep, he will be grateful to me. Those who are hostile to me can be grateful to me if they wake up. If they don't wake up, they are already asleep, let them sleep.\nAnd what harm can anybody do to me? At the most they can kill me -- that is nothing, because I have known everything that can be known and I have experienced everything that can be experienced. Now I am almost living a posthumous life. As far as I am concerned, I have come to the point beyond which there is nothing. And I am so.blissful that if somebody wants to assassinate me I don't see any harm in it.\nPeople are afraid of death because they have not lived yet and death is coming closer. I have lived, I have tasted the nectar of life. Now there is no problem for me, so I can create as much hostility as possible in the hope that perhaps a few, out of thousands, may wake up. And they are waking up.\nQ: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD AS \"MENTAL HEALTH\" IN SOCIETY... WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SLEEP?\nA: The society that exists today is retarded. Its mental age is below thirteen. It is worse than asleep. What do you expect of a seventy-year-old man, carrying a small intelligence of a thirteen-year-old boy? The distance between his intelligence and his life is so big.\nThis is sleep. The awakened person moves together almost as an organic unity. With his physical age, his mental age goes on growing. With his mental age, his spiritual awareness goes on growing. If a person really goes on growing simultaneously on all levels of life, then only you have a perfect Master someday. Otherwise, the so-called masters are masters just for those retarded people; the so-called saints, saints only for the retarded. And nobody wants -- your politicians, your priests -- nobody wants man to be intelligent because it is against their vested interests.\nAn intelligent man cannot be Catholic, an intelligent man cannot believe in the boundaries of nations, an intelligent man cannot conceive that white and black colors make any difference. An intelligent man will have a totally different vision of life.\nThese vested interests cannot allow this earth to become awake. Before it wakes up, they are ready with all their nuclear weapons to destroy it. It is such a calamity. To me, the destruction of life is not the real problem. The real problem is that man is now at a point where thousands of people can become enlightened, and the politicians are preparing to destroy this whole living beautiful earth.\nQ: YOU MEAN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF SANNYASINS, THESE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BE ENLIGHTENED?\nA: There are many who are not even sannyasins... they can be awakened. Man has gained a certain maturity. Sannyasins certainly, but there are many who are\npotential sannyasins, like you; I can see you in the orange robe any day. It all depends on your courage. But I can see a man of intelligence in front of me, who can understand, and he would like to have his consciousness blossom to its fullest.\nQ: YES, BHAGWAN, BUT IT WOULD BE, FOR ME, A BLIND GAMBLE.\nA: Every search is a blind gamble. Those who are afraid of blind gambles remain stuck and starve, they never grow. One has to take the risk. One has to stake everything. And as far as I have known, anybody who has taken the risk has never been a loser.\nI don't play the game of being a loser in any way. And if I tell my people to stake everything, I can say it with certainty, categorically, because I know that if they can stake and risk, they will be reborn.\nThere is an old story. A man was traveling and got lost in the night, in the mountains. He was really very much afraid, alone. The place was unknown, the road was lost, there was no light. As far as he could see, there was no village, no lamp. But still he tried to find his way, and then he slipped from a rock. Holding the roots of a tree, he was hanging.\nThe night was becoming colder and colder and he knew that soon he would not be able to keep a grip on the roots; the hands were becoming frozen. His death was near. He looked, and by the side, there was abysmal darkness. He knew there was a big valley by the side of the mountain and there was no chance of surviving.\nFinally, his hands started slipping. There was no way to prevent it. But he was in for a great surprise. When the hands slipped and he thought, \"This is my last moment,\" and he prayed to his god in whom he believed, the roots slipped out of his hand and he was standing on the ground. There was nothing, and the whole night he had suffered. And it was getting to be sunrise and he could see that this was strange, he was standing on the road!\nRisk is there, but I know the path. I know that if you are ready to lose your grip, you will be immediately on the clear ground, on the way; you are not going to lose anything. This is the whole function of the Master. The function of the Master is not to give you beliefs, is not to give you philosophy. His function is to give you confidence in yourself, to make you a gambler from a businessman.\nQ: BHAGWAN, WHEN I GET AROUND YOUR SANNYASINS -- I GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH THEM, IT'S PLEASANT TO BE WITH THEM -- BUT I VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT THEY FOLLOW YOU BLINDLY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I AM WRONG OR RIGHT BUT I VERY OFTEN GET THIS FEELING. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PRODUCE TEST-TUBE BABIES. NOW I'M SURE, IN SOME DAYS, ALL YOUR SANNYASINS KNOW THIS IDEA OF YOURS AND THEY AGREE WITH YOU. NOW, IN TWO WEEKS YOU SAY SOMETHING OPPOSITE -- ALL YOUR SANNYASINS AGREE WITH YOU.\nA: That means they are also growing with me. That does not make any problem.\nQ: BUT WHERE IS THEN THE DOUBT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF? I CANNOT, EVEN IF I WOULD LOVE YOU DEEPLY, I COULD NOT FOLLOW YOUR OPINIONS EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY YOU CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS, DON'T YOU?\nA: That means you are not growing with me, you are lagging far behind. My sannyasins are my fellow travelers. Sometimes I walk fast, they have to walk fast. Sometimes I dance, they have to dance. Sometimes I just relax and they have to relax. They are just my fellow travelers. There is no philosophy, no belief, no faith. They are love, pure love towards me, just the way I am pure love towards them. It is a love affair.\nQ: BUT YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO HAVE A LOVE AFFAIR.\nA: Nobody decides. I am simply love. I never fall in love. I am in it, I am it. Others go on falling in love with me. But they don't lose anything; the moment they fall in love with me, they have discovered their life's juiciest moment. They could not have even dreamed about it. Your question is very relevant.\nIn the beginning, a sannyasin is baffled, confused that I said one thing yesterday and I am saying another thing today. Now what am I supposed to do? In the beginning, it happens to every sannyasin. Soon he starts understanding that what I say is not the point. Somewhere between my statements there is a gap. Between my words there is a gap. Between my lines there is a gap. That is my real statement.\nSoon they start learning it, then they don't care what I said yesterday and what I said today. They don't compare. The gap is the same, the words have changed. The lines are different but between the lines The moment they start seeing me\nbetween the lines, between the statements, all their trouble disappears. And it is not belief\nQ: THERE IS OBJECTIVITY BETWEEN THOSE LINES?\nA: Yes\nQ: MAY I ASK QUITE ANOTHER QUESTION? ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IN THE NETHERLANDS ALSO, WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH YOUR ROLLS ROYCES, OF COURSE, AND I DECIDED I HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS.\nA: You ask anything you want.\nQ: SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THAT I, MYSELF, AM THE HAPPY OWNER OF A CAR OF THE JAPANESE MAKE, TOYOTA COROLLA. NOW, I WOULD RATHER HAVE TWO OF THEM, SO I WOULD HAVE ONE IN RESERVE BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT TO DO WITH THREE TOYOTAS. YOU HAVE, IF I AM RIGHT, SEVENTY-FIVE ROLLS ROYCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THEY'RE NOT.…\nA: You're not right. One has just arrived -- and I have no problem. There are ninety Rolls Royces, and I have no problem; and you are having problems, even with three? Poor guy! And that, too, Toyotas, a third-rate car... just a toy. And just with three you are.…\nAnd I am soon going to have 365, and still there will be no problem. I don't see any problem. I never go to the garage. I don't even know what car they are going to give me today. My people are there and they are intelligent enough, they can take care of anything. If they can take care of ninety Rolls Royces, they will be able to take care of 365. This is their problem, not mine. And I don't think they are troubled either... they look so happy. A new car arrives and they are rejoicing.\nThere is no problem in having two or three cars. The problem is somewhere else which, out of respect, you are not asking me.\nQ: WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?\nA: Yes. It is not the number. Your question is not Rolls Royces but Ethiopia, India, poor countries, poor people around the world. I am making it clear to you, because I can see it is there within you. A Rolls Royce is just to bring the question out, but you love me so you cannot ask directly. You are going around about... there is no need.\nQ: MAY I PHRASE THIS QUESTION?\nA: That's what I was doing. You can phrase. I was phrasing your question.\nQ: MY QUESTION, WHICH I HAD WRITTEN DOWN FOR THIS, IS WHY, IN YOUR VISION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL GROWTH AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP YOUR NEIGHBOR? WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A SANNYASIN AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP ETHIOPIA?\nA: Nobody is preventing anybody. I am not saying to my sannyasins, \"Don't help the neighbor.\" I am telling them, \"Help them!\" And the only way to help them is to hit them. They are asleep, they have to be awakened first. Any other help will be coming later on. Set their houses on fire so they have to wake up and escape out, then we will catch hold of them.\nI'm not preventing my people from helping, but again the same problem. Because you love me, you cannot say it directly -- I have to phrase it for you.\nQ: PLEASE DO.\nA: You want that the poor should be given bread, butter, clothes, shelter, that there are sick people who need hospitals, that there are beggars in the world... something has to be done for them, and this should be my sannyasins' responsibility.\nI don't consider it my sannyasins' responsibility. If there are poor people in the world, the priests and the politicians, and the scientists and the educationalists all are guilty of it. They have created a world which has to be poor and they exploit the poverty in many ways. For example, this beautiful woman, Mother Teresa. I don't think her face looks beautiful, but tastes differ. Your taste is a little strange. Would you like to get married to her? -- then you will know how beautiful she is.\nThese people who have been serving the poor, catering to the poor, are helping the poor to remain poor. Otherwise, the poor either would have died out of poverty or would have gone through a great revolution and changed the whole society. Only two things are possible if no help is given to them. I want no help to be given to these people; they should take their own responsibility. If they are poor and they don't want to go through a revolution, change the whole structure of the society, destroy the whole status quo, throw these governments away... and if you cannot do that, then at least you can die. Don't unnecessarily be a nuisance around.\nFor example, in Ethiopia where thousands of people are dying every day, the priests and the bishops and the popes and politicians are all just sympathy for Ethiopia. And they are trying to send food, medicine, but their whole effort is very hypocritical. On the one hand they want to save the poor in Ethiopia, on the other hand they are piling up nuclear weapons. For whom? They are not lifeloving people, they are showing sympathy to Ethiopia just as part of diplomacy. It has nothing to do with service to humanity, because their small support that they are sending is not going to help, it has not helped. It is almost like dropping a teaspoon full of sugar in the ocean to make it sweet. Great responsibility you are fulfilling: you destroyed one cup of tea!\nI am not in favor of sending any help to Ethiopia. Only one thing is possible: if these big dodos around the world, presidents and prime ministers and kings and queens, if they are really concerned with Ethiopia, then there are two alternatives for them. Stop piling up weapons and divert the whole money and energy towards Ethiopia, and Ethiopia will be saved today.\nOr, if you cannot do that, then at least do one thing: send your medical people to inject these people with something that takes them into eternal sleep. It is better to die than to starve for ninety days and then die. It is compassionate. And there is no harm if there is no Ethiopia... what harm?\nQ: SO, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU WELL, BHAGWAN, YOU SAY THAT THE MISERY IN ETHIOPIA IS VERY REAL.\nA: Mm hmm.\nQ:... AND THIS REMINDS ME OF ONE OF YOUR DISCOURSES IN WHICH YOU SAID, \"YOUR MISERY IS BOGUS.\" AND THIS AT THE TIME MADE RATHER AN IMPRESSION ON ME, AND I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT MY PERSONAL MISERY IS BOGUS INDEED.\nA: Mm hmm.\nQ: BUT THEN I WONDERED, IS THE MISERY OF THIS ETHIOPIAN MOTHER, SEEING HER CHILD DYING OF STARVATION, BOGUS ALSO?\nA: It is a totally different context. When I said your misery is your responsibility, I meant your anxieties, your anguishes, your expectations, your frustrations, your aspirations, your ambitions which are not going to be fulfilled. I meant your mental anguish. That statement was in a totally different context.\nBut in Ethiopia, it is not that the mother is imagining that her child is dying. He is really dying. The child is not imagining that the mother is dying; the mother is really dying and soon she will be dead.\nAnd fortunately in Ethiopia there are not Christian Scientists. There has been a movement in America of Christian Science. Christian Science has as one of its fundamentals that whatsoever you think becomes sooner or later a reality. Thoughts are the beginning of a certain reality.\nI have heard the story that a young boy met an old Christian Scientist lady. The lady asked the boy, \"I have not seen your father for many days. Is he not coming to the meetings of our group?\" The boy said,\"He's sick. He's in his bed.\" The old woman said, \"Nonsense. This is just mind. You just tell your father that he is only thinking he is sick:'Just think you are healthy. Think positively that you are healthy. Get out of your bed, be positive.' Don't fall into negativity -- this is our whole philosophy: positive thinking.\"\nAfter three or four days, the boy meets the old woman again in the market and the old woman says, \"What happened? Did you manage to convey the message to your father?\" He said, \"Now my father thinks he's dead. And not only my father -- everybody thinks he is no more in the house, he is in his grave!\"\nThe misery in Ethiopia is real, objectively real, and these sympathies are not going to help. They are simply keeping people starving, dying. And it is better to die instantly rather than to wait and suffer all kinds of torture that this hungry man is bound to suffer.\nAnd this is a thing to be understood, that a normally healthy man can live without food for ninety days, then he will die. Now, making these people suffer for ninety days does not seem to be compassionate. To me it is more compassionate that they are given injections so they go into eternal sleep. And\nanyway the soul does not die, so what is the problem? All these religions believe that the soul does not die, so what is the problem?\nCommunists believe that when you die, everything dies. Then, too, there is no problem. I don't see a problem from any side. And if Ethiopia is not there, who bothers? What has Ethiopia contributed to the world?\nQ: DO I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, THAT YOU SAY NOBODY SHOULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT ETHIOPIA?\nA: I am saying either do -- that means stop piling nuclear weapons, that is my first alternative. If you are really sympathetic towards dying people, then why are you creating weapons for death? That is simple hypocrisy. Stop! If you are really concerned with dying people, then whatsoever is happening in Ethiopia is nothing to what has happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nThose few moments, the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have suffered as much as one can suffer in the Christian hell. And you have now seven hundred times more nuclear weapons than there were available at the time of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And they go on piling up.\nOn the one hand, seventy-five percent of the income of every country goes to war; and on the other hand, these politicians really have beautiful masks. And they must be having many because they have to change again and again. When Ethiopia is there and people are dying, you are so sympathetic and you want to save Ethiopia. These two things don't go together, they are inconsistent.\nSo my first alternative is that the nations should stop creating more war, and the poverty not only from Ethiopia but from the whole world will disappear today. The poverty is there because our whole energy is involved with war, with the preparation for war.\nAnd if you cannot do it, then at least don't be a hypocrite. Be direct and say, \"Let Ethiopia die. We don't care. We are going to make more nuclear weapons and we are going to have a third world war, and what does it matter?\" The whole world is going to end in the third world war. Ethiopia will be saved from nuclear weapons, they will die before that. That's perfectly good. Let them die, but don't be a hypocrite.\nQ: BHAGWAN, IF PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD DECIDE TO ASK YOU TO BE HIS ADVISOR, WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM IN REGARD TO THESE NUCLEAR ARMS?\nA: Just tell your scientists to find some creative use for all these weapons, because you cannot throw them into the Pacific; sooner or later they will explode just by accident. You cannot throw them into the Atlantic, you cannot throw them and bury them under the earth. Anytime, anything can trigger them and they can explode your own country or somebody else's. But energy is neutral,\nenergy is never decisive whether it can destroy or it can create. It depends on the direction that the human mind gives it.\nIf the human mind can create nuclear weapons to destroy, it can change nuclear power into construction. It can create more electricity, it can give better rains, it can give better earth. It can do miracles.\nSo much energy is piled up in these two nations, and smaller piles in smaller nations, that if they all simply think once, \"What are we doing? Our scientists should be together. \"\nMy advice is that the scientists should not be under any national regime. There should be a world academy of scientists who can decide how to convert nuclear weapons and energy into positive things. It is possible.\nQ: BUT PRACTICALLY, SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DISARM?\nA: I am not saying disarm. Changing nuclear weapons into creativity does not mean disarm; because you have many more arms than just the nuclear weapons. You could fight the first world war without weapons, you could fight the second world war -- you had already won before you threw the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Germany had already surrendered and Japan was on the verge of surrendering.\nAtomic and nuclear weapons should be completely converted to serve humanity. And go back before the first world war: those bombs and those airplanes are good. Whenever you feel an itch to fight, fight!\nUp to the first world war I allow; then fight. It is perfectly good once in a while, good exercise. But I am not ready to accept the third world war. Every effort should be made to prevent it -- and this is a beautiful chance.\nEthiopia, India and other countries of the third world are on the verge; any moment there will be more Ethiopias. It is good we start transforming that energy into something positive and creative that can help these people who are dying.\nIf you cannot do it -- remember my condition -- if you cannot do it, then don't unnecessarily try to pretend that you are Christians and Catholics and Protestants, and you are sending money and you are sending blankets, and you are sending clothes and food. It is not going to help, it has never helped before. This has been happening again and again through history. Just be very clear and send medical teams so all Ethiopians in one night go into eternal sleep. At least they will not be hungry tomorrow morning.\nQ: YES.\nA: And you will be at ease, Ethiopia will not be a troublesome problem for you. So I am giving two alternatives. And remember my first priority is to stop\nnuclear weapons piling up more and more, and divert the whole money that you are wasting on nuclear weapons.\nMy second alternative is: if that is not possible, then just simply accept the fact that we cannot save Ethiopia, but we can at least help them to die peacefully. We cannot help them to live peacefully, at least we can help them to die peacefully. And that will be really great compassion on the part of politicians. Rather than leaving them starving, dying, getting tortured by hunger. For four years there\nhave been no rains. Water has become almost impossible to get. Not only food is not available, water is not available.\nAnd it is only in one country right now, but soon India will be joining it, because half of the Indian continent is starving. And you will be surprised to know that the Indian prime minister is selling wheat to other countries. Fifty percent of his own nation is starving and the wheat is being sold because he wants a nuclear plant in India. Can you see the stupidity of this whole thing?\nQ: MAY I CHANGE TO A SUBJECT WITH A BIT MORE FUN?\nA: You can change.\nQ: IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU DESCRIBED YOUR COMMUNE AS A CIRCUS AND YOURSELF AS A GREAT SHOWMAN, THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. WERE YOU MOCKING YOURSELF AND YOUR COMMUNE? WHY DID YOU SAY IT?\nA: Again, you are bringing the past here. Forget all about that nonsense. I am a showman? And my people a circus? I contradict it completely.\nQ: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT NOW?\nA: Yes... there is no circus here. This is the only place where a circus is not happening.\nQ: AND YOU ARE A SERIOUS TEACHER?\nA: I am a very non-serious teacher! And I have already forgotten about what news conference you are talking! I just respond to you. Why drag the dead unnecessarily out of their graves? Let them sleep silently. You are alive, I am alive, we can have an existential encounter.\nAnd I see the potentiality in you, that's why I am saying that. I would not have said it to another person. I have been interviewed every night, every evening -- and now this is going to be continuous -- but I would not have said that to another journalist. I don't see you just as a journalist, I see you more as a seeker. I see you more as a human being. And I see your heart throbbing with me, in tune\nwith me, that's why I am saying it. Otherwise, I can go on answering about the past, anything that comes to my mind, there is no problem about it.\nI love jokes. And to joke on other people's account is not very good, not nice. So, once in a while, I joke upon myself, upon my people. And it was simply a joke, and those idiotic newspaper journalists thought it is something serious. Do you think a showman will sit here in the desert? Is this the place for a showman? Then I would have chosen Hollywood. On the contrary, I have pulled all my Hollywood people here.\nIn this desert, 126 square miles, I am sitting the whole day in my room. I only come out twice: in the morning to talk with the sannyasins, in the evening to talk with any interviewer. What kind of a showman do you think I am? This is not the way of being a showman.\nThe showman has to be always running -- like Mother Teresa. She is in New York, she is in Chicago, she is in Washington, she is receiving a Nobel prize in Norway, she is in India, Calcutta. I wonder when she gets the time to serve the poor people. All the time she is moving around the world, becoming a bigger and bigger celebrity. The more she is becoming senile, the bigger a celebrity she is becoming. And when does she serve the poor people? She is inaugurating colleges, schools, hospitals.…\nI don't have any time for showmanship. I will tell you my routine and you will see: from where can I get the time? Six o'clock in the morning, I wake up. That too, my caretaker, Vivek, has to wake me up, otherwise I will not wake up. Who cares to wake up again? I have been waking for half a century again and again. It is enough.\nBut she wakes me up, gives me a cup of tea. Just to be respectful to her, I drink the tea. My tea is not much, it is just water and tea leaves. No sugar, no milk. If that kind of tea is served in heaven, all the saints will start moving towards hell. Then -- I have always loved water, from my very childhood -- one and a half hours in the morning I am in my bathroom, enjoying the bathtub, the shower; and the same in the evening, one and a half hours again.\nAfter my bath, immediately I have to get into the car and move to the Mandir where my people are waiting. Back to my place, it is lunchtime. I take my lunch at eleven, and go to sleep again, which I have done most of my life. I had to miss my classes when I was a student, and my teachers allowed it because if they did not allow, then I used to sleep in the class. I said, \"There is no way... I have to sleep these two hours.\"\nWhen I was a professor, I was sleeping two hours and I had told the vice- chancellor that during these two hours no classes should be given to me; otherwise I would be sleeping there.\nAt two o'clock I wake up, and for one hour I go for a ride. That is the only time I come in contact with the Rolls Royces. I love driving, and I have certainly one of the most beautiful roads, because it is made by my sannyasins only for me. There\nis no traffic, so I need not bother whether I am driving on the right or on the left. The whole road belongs to me. One hour there and back home.\nOne and a half hours I simply sit silently in my chair doing nothing and let the grass grow by itself Then my bath.\nAfter the bath, I take my supper; and after the supper, I am here. I will be back there nearabout nine, nine-thirty. Then comes my personal secretary -- with letters from all over the world; news cuttings about me from all over the world, anything that the personal secretary feels I need to know -- because I don't read. Since five years I have stopped reading anything: books, newspapers, magazines, anything.\nThe clippings that my personal secretary brings she has to read; I simply listen. Nearabout eleven, I go to bed again. Now, where will I find the time to be a showman? Yes, you can look at my dress and think it looks like the dress of a showman. It is not, it is the love of my people. I am dressing for them. They make beautiful dresses, they enjoy making them for me. I cannot refuse them. And to whom am I going to show? I never go out of this place.\nYou see my watch? I have hundreds. My people are really intelligent people -- no Master in the whole history can claim such an intelligent group. Now, this is made by my sannyasins. It has already defeated Piaget -- and it is made of real stones, not diamonds.\nQ: REAL STONES?\nA: Real stones, not diamonds. So don't carry the idea that it is a fake watch. Real stones are as real as real diamonds, there is no question of its being fake.\nI just heard on television one stupid journalist saying that I have been using fake watches. I cannot understand: so authentic stones, and you call it a fake watch? Its time is absolutely perfect; in a year only one second will be the difference, and that is the best any watch can do. It is as beautiful as any diamond. The same watch from Piaget is a half million dollars, just because of an idiotic idea that diamonds have some value. This watch costs nothing, but I will not sell it even for ten million dollars because it is invaluable. It is made with such great love that it is not a saleable thing. Love cannot be sold. But to whom am I going to show the watch? My people know my dresses, my people know my watches, my people know me. I don't mix with anybody else, I don't go anywhere else. As far as I am concerned, the third world war has happened, and only Rajneeshpuram is saved. There is nowhere else to go.\nI was simply joking. And my people are working hard, twelve hours, fourteen hours a day, transforming a desert into an oasis -- and do you think these people constitute a circus?\nYou will not find anywhere in the world such hardworking people, and they are not being paid, because we don't believe in any way inside the commune that money should be used. There is no need. We fulfill our needs, our food, our\nclothes, everything, so nobody needs any money. Whatsoever he needs, he can get.\nThese people are working so hard, and for what? To entertain somebody? These people are creative people. They love me and now they want to materialize my vision into reality. And they are ready to do anything for it. In festival times, they are working fourteen, sixteen hours a day with no complaint. Nobody is telling them or forcing them.\nQ: YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THEM?\nA: No. Not at all. I never talk to them about these things. I never talk about the commune, about any mundane things. They are intelligent enough that they can manage themselves. And they are doing so well that it cannot be improved.\nQ: IT WAS THEIR IDEA, IT WAS NOT YOUR IDEA, THIS COMMUNE?\nA: It is my vision, and their love for my vision, but the idea to materialize it is theirs. I am a dreamer: I can give you beautiful dreams, and I give for free -- I don't charge for them. But then if you get caught up in the dream and you start trying to materialize it, that is your responsibility. I simply watch from the outside.\nIt is not a circus. The Vatican may be a circus, and with Pope the Polack it is bound to be a circus. Nothing more can be expected of this thick head. I was just joking, laughing. And our people were there in the press conference and they enjoyed. You should listen to the video of the press conference, then you will see how much our people enjoyed and how silly the journalists looked. They could not manage to ask any significant question.\nBut you need not bother about those people. You have a certain acquaintance with me, so I know these answers will be enough for you. If you want to add something, you can add -- I give you the authority. I love you and I trust you. I know you cannot do anything that will be against me.\nOkay?\nQ: THANK YOU.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #18 Chapter title: It Is Possible 4 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 29.]\nMike Wolfe KBND RADIO BEND OREGON\nQ: BHAGWAN, MY NAME IS MIKE WOLFE. I'VE BEEN IN THE RADIO AND TELEVISION BUSINESS -- IN WASHINGTON D.C., DENVER, COLORADO -- SO I'VE TRAVELED A BIT AND GOT TIRED OF THE BIG CITIES AND CAME TO CENTRAL OREGON. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS INTERESTING TO ME, AND WILL ALWAYS MAKE ME REMEMBER YOU, IS THAT I HAVE A SIX-AND-A-HALF-YEAR OLD SON WHO WAS ALSO BORN ON DECEMBER 11TH. SO I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER BHAGWAN'S BIRTHDAY.\nA: That's great!\nQ: I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME YEAR, HOWEVER.\nTHE HOSPITALITY, I MUST SAY, IN THE BEGINNING HERE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED.… AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING, THERE IS OF COURSE CONTROVERSY, MAYBE MISREPRESENTED CONTROVERSY, THAT RAJNEESHPURAM IS AN ARMED CAMP. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT; THAT THE PEOPLE ARE COLD AND DISINTERESTED IN THOSE OF US WHO LIVE OUTSIDE -- AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT I HAVE NOT FELT IN MANY ROOMS IN MY LIFE AS MUCH LOVE AS THERE IS IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE MAY REALIZE THAT.\nI WANT TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE CITY OF RAJNEESHPURAM WHICH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW AND VISIT IN A VERY QUICK WAY TODAY, AND ASK IF THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THAT MAYBE THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH AS I NOW BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE, COULD IN YOUR MIND DEVELOP INTO A PROTOTYPE OF WHAT CITIES POSSIBLY COULD AND SHOULD BE?\nA: Yes, that's exactly my idea. This loving commune should become a prototype, because in the vast world, even though you are in the crowd, you are alone. Here, even if you are alone, you know and you feel the warmth of people all around you.\nLove is something which is nobody's monopoly. A loving person is simply a love-radiating energy. And when there are thousands of people radiating love, there is a certain energy field. I called it the Buddhafield. Anybody who comes will receive the love, the friendship, the hospitality... but people are afraid to come.\nQ: WHY?\nA: For the simple reason that we are strangers. This is animal instinct. Animals are afraid of strangers. Every animal has its own territorial prerogative. If you keep out of the territory he will not get disturbed or upset, but if you enter into his territory, then immediately he is hostile. That instinct is still alive in man.\nWe are outsiders. In many ways our ways of thinking are different, our values are different, our priorities are different. We are for a better man and for a better humanity, and their fear and hostility is natural.\nQ: ARE THE HOSTILITIES CREATED OR PERPETRATED BY THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE ABSENCE, AS IT WOULD APPEAR TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, OF A WILLINGNESS FOR THE RAJNEESHEES TO GO OUT, RATHER THAN ACCEPT IN, SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM?\nA: No. This is my basic standpoint: not to go out, because that is interfering into somebody's world. I am not a missionary and I hate the word. I don't want anybody to be converted, and I don't want anybody to be convinced that we are right. In fact the people who try to convince others that they are right are basically, deep down in themselves, not convinced that they are right. Convincing others, they are making an effort to convince themselves.\nWhen they see they have a crowd convinced, then they feel at ease. Then they know, \"I cannot be wrong. If so many people are converted by me, then I cannot be wrong.\"\nThis outgoing is impossible for me or my people. We are here, we do no harm to anybody, and we don't want to interfere in anybody's thinking, way of life, his style, his religion, his politics -- we do not want to interfere. We accept him as he is. But if he wants to be acquainted with our world, he is welcome.\nQ: BUT TO BE EXPOSED TO YOUR WORLD, TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE EXPOSURE -- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO hate THIS PARTICULAR GROUP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE GROUP, I WOULD IMAGINE, WHO FEEL\nTHAT AND REALIZE THAT HATE OUTSIDE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GOES ON HERE -- WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA, not AS A MISSIONARY, not REACHING OUT TO CONVERT, BUT IN FACT TO INFORM?\nA: I will wait, because if they are hating me and my people, they are on the way towards Rajneeshpuram. Hate is a relationship, and sometimes far stronger than love. And once they come here, then we will see.…\nQ: BUT IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THIS HATE -- USING THAT WORD, SINCE I BROUGHT IT UP -- IS BRED BY FEAR, WHICH IS BRED BY SOMETHING UNKNOWN. THIS IS A MYSTERIOUS WORLD INSIDE THIS VALLEY.\nA: Yes, that is true. That mysteriousness in this valley will attract only those people who are ready to go on an adventure, who want to explore, who want to know the unknown -- and those are the only people who have any worth.\nQ: WHAT KIND OF WORTH?\nA: They are adventurers -- they are on a pilgrimage to know the unknown -- they are the real people. Others are just living like animals, without exploration.\nQ: SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT SELECT GROUP OF RISK-TAKERS?\nA: Yes. With me, only that select group can have a communion.\nQ: WHAT IS... WHAT IS THE FUTURE -- AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OR ADDRESS YOURSELF TO IT -- BUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE OFRAJNEESHPURAM? WE GOT OFF THE TRACK A LITTLE BIT. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY, THE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT I'VE SEEN TODAY -- AGRICULTURALLY, CERTAINLY THE COMMUNAL WAY OF LIFE. WHAT DO YOU VIEW AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS VALLEY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS TRAVEL WITH YOU?\nA: I'm not concerned with it. My concern is with people and their growth. The city is their concern, not my concern. And I have so many intelligent people here, architects, engineers, doctors, professors -- from all the professions, daring, adventurous people have come to me. Now it is up to them, a mundane affair, I don't care about it. I trust them, they will be able to manage, and they are managing. And they will be able to develop it technologically, but it is not my concern at all.\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN?\nA: My concern is their spiritual growth. Their intelligence should come to its highest peak. They should be deprogrammed from all past, rotten and dead, meaningless and harmful.… My work is not to create the city, but to create the man, and then the man will take care of the city and the houses. That is a totally different matter. I don't bother about it.\nBut my basic concern is the individual. The individual is to me the highest value in life. And all the religions of the world have repressed the individual. They have all made him feel guilty, they have all made him somehow think himself unworthy, a sinner. All the religions, in different ways, have forced everybody into a corner where he is no more human. They have humiliated humanity. It was their vested interest.\nThey needed a world of slaves, not a world of rebels. And you can make a person shrink if you make him guilty. You can make him afraid of hell, you can make him greedy for heaven, and this way you can make him completely forget this moment, this life. All the religions have been trying... either they are focusing you on the past, or they are focusing you on future, beyond death. No religion bothers that you should be alive, laughing, living, loving, flowering -- here and now -- and that's my purpose.\nQ: DO YOU THINK THAT THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE BIG BUSINESS AND THAT IS THE WAY TO CONTROL PEOPLE?\nA: It is a great conspiracy between the politicians and the priests. It has been for thousands of years. The conspiracy is that the politician rules people as far as worldly things are concerned and the priest rules people as far as their psychology, their mind, their souls are concerned. And they have enslaved man in every possible way: the politician from the outside and the priest from the inside -- they have destroyed all potential of human beings.\nMy work is to bring that potential back, make the person aware that he is not guilty if Adam and Eve disobeyed God -- that is their business. You cannot be guilty for Adam and Eve disobeying God. This is so stupid! In the first place, disobedience is not always bad. And as far as Adam and Eve's disobedience is concerned, it was certainly beneficial to humanity. In fact, God was the enemy, because he was prohibiting Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of knowledge and the tree of eternal life. Now, who is the enemy?\nWisdom, knowledge, science -- all that we value in life -- paintings, poetry, sculpture, nothing would have happened if Adam and Eve had not disobeyed. They would have been still naked animals in the garden of Eden, chewing grass!\nQ: MY GOD, I HOPE THAT... I CAN'T PICTURE ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM CHEWING GRASS!\nA: You cannot picture it because of Adam and Eve. You should feel grateful to Adam and Eve!\nQ: I DO NOW!\nA: Yes!\nQ: YOU KNOW, PSYCHOLOGISTS TELL US ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE DIRECTED BACK TO OUR MOTHER, BUT NOW YOU'RE TAKING IT SO DAMN FAR BACK, I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND IT!\nA: They take all the problems to the mother and they forget the real father. That is male chauvinistic psychology. The whole psychology is created by man, just as all the religions are created by man. The woman is condemned by the religions, and she is condemned now by the psychologists. In fact the psychologist is slowly taking the place of the priest because the priest is becoming out of date. Younger generations are no more interested in the priest. They have seen five thousand years of human history, what these priests have done.\nThe younger generation is more interested in psychotherapy, in psychoanalysis, in other different methods of psychic exploration. The priest is no more in the powerful position that he has always been.\nSo you will be surprised that all the priests in the world are now studying psychology, to become psychotherapists. It is going to become a necessary qualification for every bishop, every priest, to have some degree of psychology, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, because they are aware that their power is slipping away and the psychologist is replacing them. He is becoming the new priest. But the trouble is, the new priest is also serving the old vested interest; he is not revolutionary.\nQ: IS NOT THE PROCLIVITY TOWARD PSYCHOLOGY APPOINTMENTS OR PSYCHIATRY APPOINTMENTS -- WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY, AS THEY STATE IT, FIND OUT ABOUT THEMSELVES -- SOMEWHAT THE SAME PARALLEL AS TO WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM?\nA: No! Because your psychologists, even the founders -- Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Adler, Assagioli -- even they knew nothing about themselves, so how can they help you to know yourself?\nJung had been to India. He went to see the Taj Mahal, he went to Calcutta, to Bombay, and everywhere he was told, \"You being a great psychologist, the place you should go first is to a man in south India, Maharishi Raman.\" That man was conceived by the whole country as one who knows himself \"You should go there\nand see whether it is true or not. And if he knows himself, perhaps you can learn something from him; if he does not know, you can help him to know.\"\nBut he would not go there, and in his diary he wrote: \"I was afraid to go there, to face the eyes of a man who knows himself, because I don't know myself.\" He returned without going to Maharishi Raman. And when he was back he must have been feeling guilty, that this is not right. Going to see the ruins of palaces was worthless for a psychologist. He was not a historian. Going to see big cities, what was the point for him? He must have started feeling guilty, that everywhere he went, every friend he knew, all the professors in all the universities, in all the psychological departments, were pointing towards one man -- and he did not go there.\nOut of that guilt he started writing against Indian mysticism. He started saying that Westerners should remain aloof to the Eastern tradition of mysticism, because it is dangerous for the Western man. Western man's development is different, Eastern man's development is different, their psychologies are different. This he said for the first time after coming back from India.\nPsychologies are not different. There may be minute details which are different, but the basic psychology is not different, cannot be different. He projected his own fear over all history.\nSo I don't think these psychologists are helping anybody in any way. They can't help themselves. Do you know, the suicide rate of psychologists is double that of average human beings.\nQ: I THINK IT'S EVEN WORSE.…\nA: Yes. It may have grown higher, because for five years I have not been reading a single word, of any book, of any newspaper. For five years I have simply stopped... so perhaps it may have gone higher. But five years ago, it was double. And the same was the situation with madness -- it was double any other profession. And the same was the proportion of all kinds of perverted acts.\nThese people -- suicidal, insane, committing perverted acts, finding excuses to do them through psychology -- do you think they can help anybody to know himself?\nQ: IF YOUR THINKING AND YOUR BELIEF IS AS YOU STATE IT -- AND I ASSUME CERTAINLY THAT IT IS -- AND THE WORLD IS IN THE CHAOS THAT IT'S IN... I MEAN, THIS IS ABOUT AS SCREWED UP AS IT CAN GET.…\nA: Yes.\nQ:... MAYBE A LITTLE WORSE DOWN THE LINE, BUT I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO MAXIMUM.\nA: It is.\nQ: WHY THEN DOES NOT BHAGWAN STEP FORWARD, NOT AS A SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, NOT AS A GOD, BUT AS A MAN WHO HAS RECOGNIZED WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, HAS AN IDEA OF THE SOLUTION, AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW? GRANTED, IT'S AVAILABLE IF THEY COME HERE, BUT IT IS A MASSIVE JOURNEY TO COME HERE, AND THE ROAD IS TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY, WHICH DOESN'T HELP, EITHER.…\nA: It is a massive journey. That's why you are here: you take the message. Q: BUT I'M NOT A MISSIONARY EITHER.\nA: No, you are not a missionary.\nQ: AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A MISSIONARY.\nA: No. I don't want anybody to be a missionary.…\nQ: BUT YOU'VE BECOME A MAN OF THE WORLD. A: No.\nQ: YOU HAVE BECOME A MAN WHO IS VERY VISIBLE. OH, BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE.\nA: Mmm?\nQ: THE WORLD PRESS KNOWS ABOUT BHAGWAN. YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE GREAT SHOW BUSINESS TEACHERS OF ALL TIME.\nA: That's true!\nQ: AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT AT THE SAME TIME, ON A SERIOUS NOTE -- WELL, AM I CORRECT OR AM I NOT? -- IF YOUR MESSAGE IS AS YOU STATED, WOULD IT NOT BE TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL MANKIND IF BHAGWAN WOULD TAKE HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD?\nA: No, not on the road. I can manage from here! And I am managing it well!\nQ: WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH, GETTING BACK AGAIN.… YOU KNOW, I WAS INTIMIDATED.… I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES, A RECENT ARTICLE -- AND ON THE BACK PAGE IS THE KIDS' CORNER WHICH WAS THE ONLY ONE I UNDERSTOOD. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT COLUMN, A YOUNGSTER HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS HELD HERE TWO WEEKS AGO AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORLD PRESS TO GATHER AND MEET WITH YOU, AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY, BUT ALL HE HEARD WAS THE SAME OLD QUESTIONS.\nNOW I HAVE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN SINCE THE PRESS KIT WHICH CONTAINED THAT PARTICULAR EDITION CAME TO ME, TRYING TO THINK OF SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT I'M JUST A PRETTY SIMPLE GUY. WHAT I SEE IS, VERY SIMPLY, THAT YOU HAVE SOME THINGS TO SAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THIS POINT DON'T BUY, WHICH YOU MAY NOT CARE ABOUT. WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT IT?\nA: Why should I care?\nQ: BUT WHY SHOULDN'T YOU CARE?... AND WE CAN PLAY MONOPOLY WITH THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH.\nA: No.\nQ: YOU STATE THAT YOUR INTEREST IS IN THE INDIVIDUAL. IS THAT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HERE, OR WITHIN THE RAJNEESH GROUP?\nA: No. The individual is everywhere, whether he is here or not, because only the individual exists. Societies are just names, collectivities are all names. The reality is only of the individual. And I am trying my best, sitting in my room. That's why You can see in all the papers, on the radio, on the television, a man who does not go out of this small valley. And I will go on hammering all over the world from here. What is the point of traveling?\nQ: WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS: YOU DO NOT GO OUT OF THE VALLEY, BUT IS IT NOT CORRECT THAT YOU SPENT THREE NIGHTS IN BEND AT THE RIVERHOUSE MOTEL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?\nA: No.\nQ: THEN SOMEONE IS PAYING YOU THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPERSONATING YOU.\nA: Hmm!\nQ: BECAUSE IT WAS TOLD TO ME THAT YOU SPENT A SUNDAY NIGHT, A MONDAY NIGHT AND A TUESDAY NIGHT, WITH A NURSE AND A BODYGUARD. AND YOU WERE SEEN IN THE JACUZZI AND IN THE LOUNGE AND YOU WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME. SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THEY KEPT SNIFFING MY HAIR TODAY BEFORE I SAT DOWN TO TALK TO YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DIDN'T SNIFF EVERYBODY'S HAIR AT THE RIVERHOUSE IN BEND, OREGON.\nTHOSE KINDS OF MISDIRECTED IDEAS -- IF IN FACT YOU WERE NOT THERE -- SOMETIMES BREAK DOWN A LITTLE CREDIBILITY FOR BHAGWAN, AND I WONDER IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING -- GETTING BACK TO IT SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY -- TO BE PROJECTED TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nA: First, the nonserious part.\nQ: DON'T TRY TO GET A BIGGER LAUGH THAN I DID.\nA: I was not in the hotel, but I can be.\nQ: WELL, YOU PROBABLY COULD BUY THE HOTEL IF YOU WANTED TO.\nA: In fact, I have... and I have everything that any hotel in America can have. You have just to see my bathroom. Perhaps it is the best in the whole world.\nQ: YOUR BATHROOM?\nA: My bathroom.\nQ: IS THAT AN INVITATION?\nA: Yes.\nQ: I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE. I'VE BEEN TOLD I BELONGED IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE, BUT NEVER INVITED TO ONE.\nA: I am a rare and a unique person in every way: I invite you into my bathroom! Q: THAT IS UNIQUE. BUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM THERE?\nA: There is nowhere to go. Enjoy the jacuzzi there, enjoy the shower there, enjoy the hot shower, enjoy the ice-cold shower.…\nQ: AND THEN GET OUT... L UNDERSTAND! I NEED TO KNOW THIS FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION: HAVE YOU EVER INVITED A MEMBER OF THE PRESS TO YOUR BATHROOM BEFORE?\nA: No...\nQ: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nA:... because I never liked any man the way I like you. Q: I WONDER IF THIS COULD BE LOVE?\nA: This is!\nQ: INVITED TO THE BATHROOM.… WELL, I'M SURE THE LISTENERS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE THINKING YOU AND I ARE GOING TO START A NIGHTCLUB ACT.\nWHAT IS THE POTENTIAL -- SINCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A MOMENT AGO -- OF UNITING THE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MATERIALISTIC, AND THE EASTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY NOT MATERIALISTIC BUT IS MORE AN INNER -- WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT -- AN INNER RECOGNITION OF ONESELF?\nNOW YOU HAVE DONE A MAGNIFICENT JOB IN MANY RESPECTS -- THAT DIAMOND WRISTWATCH OF COURSE IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EASTERN PHILOSOPHY -- AND YET THE REST OF YOUR PRESENTATION IS SOMEWHAT EASTERN. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE TWO CULTURES TO UNITE?\nA: That's what I have been doing! And that's why both sides of the culture are angry at me. The Easterners are angry with me because they think I am materialist.…\nQ: AND ARE THEY RIGHT? A: No.\nQ: YOU'RE NOT MATERIALISTIC?\nA: No, not in their sense. And the Western people -- particularly the materialist, the communist -- they are angry with me because I am bringing spiritualism.\nMy approach is that man is both together. This existence is not split into matter and spirit. This existence is one organic unity, just as your soul and your body are an organic unity. Your soul cannot exist without your body, and your body cannot be alive without the soul.\nI am destroying the whole idea of the separation, of a split between matter and mind, body and soul, materialism and spiritualism. I call myself Zorba the Buddha. My restaurants, my discos are all named after me: Zorba the Buddha.\nNow Buddhists are angry. The ambassador of Ceylon in America wrote me a letter saying, \"In my country people will be angry about it. Please don't use Buddha's name with Zorba.\" I replied to him, \"We don't mean your Buddha; your Buddha's name was Gautam Siddhartha. Buddha is not anybody's name, it is a quality. It means the Awakened One. It can be used for anybody who is awakened. So don't get upset about it.\"\nMy effort is that Zorba and Buddha have to be bridged. Zorba represents the materialist's life in all its luxury -- hence this diamond wristwatch, hence all my Rolls Royces. I live the most luxurious life that any man has ever lived, with no worry. People have much more money -- I don't have a single cent -- but they cannot live such a luxurious life as I am living, with no worry, no bank account, no income tax... and having everything that anybody can have!\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR SECRET, BHAGWAN? I REALLY THINK YOU'RE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS. I MEAN BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST DOCUMENTED, YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CON MEN, IT WOULD SEEM.\nA: I am!\nQ: AND IT TAKES A GREAT MAN TO ADMIT THAT.\nA: Certainly!\nQ: AND IT TAKES AN EQUALLY GREAT MAN TO SIT AND ACCEPT IT AND REVEL IN IT, BHAGWAN.\nA: Right!\nQ: I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORMER DEAD CITY OF ANTELOPE. THIS HAS OF COURSE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROVERSY. I HAVE ONLY LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL OREGON AREA FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA. IT WAS MY FIRST TRIP THROUGH ANTELOPE, AND I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO ASK IS: WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT ANTELOPE? I MEAN WHAT IS THE PURPOSE AND\nWHAT ARE THE PLANS? I DON'T SEE IT BECOMING A RESORT AREA. I DON'T SEE IT BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL AREA. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE FOR THEIR OWN PARTICULAR REASONS, WHO OF COURSE DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT MAN -- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. WHAT WAS THE POINT?\nA: In fact, again you bring me to something in which I have no interest. Just not to be impolite to you, I am answering it.\nWhen we came here four years ago there was 126 square miles of land, just desert, and that one house there, for a guard to take care of the land -- what could he do with 126 square miles of land...? And the owners had been trying to sell it for almost half a century, but who would purchase this desert, for what?\nWhen we came here I wanted a big place. That big a property was not available anywhere else. When we came here we needed our people to stay in Antelope, because there were no houses here. Before we made houses and roads and restaurants and eating places, they had to remain in Antelope. The population of Antelope was less than my sannyasins. And the Antelope population started behaving with great hostility: they wouldn't allow any permit, they wouldn't allow them to purchase any land, they wouldn't allow change of zone -- small things. My people told them, \"We don't want your city or your government. We are simply here for the time being, and we will be moving to our own city. But we have to create the city, and before we create it we have to be here. This is the nearest place.\"\nAnd because they wouldn't listen, and they tried in every possible way to hinder, naturally my people thought that the best way was to take over the government. What is the need of asking permission from these people when we have the government and we give the permission? -- so they took over, there was no problem in it.\nIf you had come four years ago and seen Antelope, you would not have believed it.\nQ: I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT TODAY. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL THE FLACK WAS ABOUT.\nA: Four years ago it was absolutely a cemetery. Q: WHAT IS IT NOW?\nA: Now it is a dancing place. We have made a dead city alive. Now hundreds of sannyasins are living there. And since we took over the government, we have done many things there: we have made better roads, we are trying to make new houses, a big housing colony, we are going to make a big hospital there, we have\ntaken the school and raised the standard of the school. We are doing everything there, and now it is part of us. Now nobody can take it over from us.\nQ: BUT THEY ARE TRYING?\nA: They are trying and we are enjoying. They are trying to collect 84,000 signatures so that in the next election they can ask the governor to dissolve Antelope into Wasco County.\nThey certainly know they cannot win, because only eight or ten old Antelopians are there and one hundred sannyasins are there. They cannot win democratically, and this is absolutely unconstitutional. If it is done, then we are going to fight up to the Supreme Court.\nQ: WAS IT CONSTITUTIONAL TO TAKE IT OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE?\nA: Taking over is not the problem. They are the majority; the majority should rule. It is not a question of taking over.\nQ: IS IT AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH QUESTION THOUGH, NOW THAT YOUR CITY IS ESTABLISHED?\nA: Not yet. They are not allowing it to be established yet. Our city is under litigation. And we have been telling them that if you allow us whatever we need, if you help -- and we are creating a beautiful place for you in a desert -- we can leave Antelope. That was our basic proposal to them.\nQ: AND THAT STANDS NOW?\nA: No. No more.\nQ: NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE?\nA: Now we are not going to leave!\nQ: AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INVITE ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE INTO YOUR BATHROOM?\nA: No.\nQ: YOU WILL FIGHT THIS AS HIGH AS IT MUST GO?\nA: We will fight it, and I know constitutionally it is absolutely wrong to dissolve. So let them.. and then we go to the Supreme Court. And it has been so in many cases; we have never been losers.\nLast year we brought thousands of street people to share our homes with us, and the Oregon government got simply mad about it. They started thinking that we were going to take over the county or we were going to take over Oregon.\nQ: THEIR FEELING WAS THAT YOU WERE CONTROLLING THE ELECTION, I THINK, IS THAT NOT CORRECT?\nA: No, not at all.\nQ: NO, I MEAN their FEELING WAS THAT.\nA: Their feeling was that.\nQ: AND THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE ELECTION COMMISSION LAST WEEK.\nA: Yes. That has been rejected.\nQ: BUT, IN DEFENSE OF YOUR ACTIONS, IS NOT THE OREGON ELECTION LAW, RESIDENT LAW -- I MEAN YOU CAN WALK IN AND TEN MINUTES LATER YOU CAN VOTE -- SO ANTIQUATED THAT, ON THE BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU WANTED TO CONTROL THE ELECTION -- WHICH PROBABLY YOU DID...\nA: No.\nQ:... THAT YOU COULD BRING THESE PEOPLE IN AND THAT THEY COULD HAVE VOTED LEGALLY IN THAT ELECTION. IS THAT NOT CORRECT?\nA: We were not concerned with taking over the county. What will we do with the county? It is unnecessary, taking the burden of the county, which is bankrupt -- why should we bother? We have to develop our own place!\nQ: WHAT DID YOU BRING THE PEOPLE IN FOR?\nA: We had surplus money. After every festival we have nearabout two to three million dollars and we want to share it. This time we will be bringing some other group. Each year we are going to bring different groups of people -- perhaps we may invite the blacks!\nQ: MY GOD, I DON'T KNOW IF OREGON'S READY FOR THAT!\nA: Get ready! But every year we are going to invite somebody or other.\nQ: WELL, THE COMPLAINT THOUGH, IN THE BEND AREA AND IN OTHER AREAS, WAS THAT YOU BROUGHT THEM IN AND THEN YOU TURNED THEM LOOSE.\nA: No.\nQ: AND THAT THEY THEN BECAME WARDS OF THE VARIOUS VENUES THAT THEY LANDED IN, FOUND THEMSELVES IN... FOUND THEMSELVES INTENTIONALLY BREAKING LAWS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE.…\nA: No. That is absolutely wrong, because we had brought people first with a contract that whenever they wanted to go, we would give them the ticket, return ticket.\nQ: YOU PROVIDED THEM ALL A TICKET?\nA: We provided all those people with whom we had the contract. After two weeks, we dropped the idea of the contract, because the idea was... how would these poor people dare to come here on a one-way ticket? So we gave them round trip tickets -- they could go back -- but once they settled here, they started sending messages to their friends. Then we told the people, \"If they want to come.… Your people are there, you can contact them. You know what the situation is here -- if they want to come, we will give them only a one-way ticket\"\n-- and that was the contract. So those people who had the contract for a one-way ticket got a one-way ticket, and that was their responsibility. We have nothing to do with it.\nAnd we were giving them three months to be here, every facility, but the Christians -- particularly Christian churches and associations around -- became very much troubled about that. The fear was that perhaps we would turn them into sannyasins. Christians started coming here, Christian priests started having demonstrations in Madras, in Portland, and they persuaded them to go back.\nHere they were receiving everything free, here they were living better than they had ever lived before, and many of them are still here. After three months it was a free choice for them: if they wanted to go back, their ticket was there; if they didn't want to go back, they could remain here. They HAVE remained here, and we have been receiving hundreds of letters from the people who have left saying that it was wrong on their side to listen to the Christians and leave the place. They would love to come back again.\nIt was not our responsibility letting those people loose in Oregon. It was the State of Oregon and the Christian churches of Oregon who created the whole paranoia. The state created the paranoia about the election, and the churches created the paranoia about religion. But the people who are here -- nobody has tried to make them sannyasins. If they wanted to become, that was their business.\nAnd sannyas is such a nonserious phenomenon. It is not a fanatic type of group; it is very loose and free. If you want to become a sannyasin we don't make any conditions, we don't ask for any qualifications. You simply become a sannyasin. If you want to drop it, goodbye, you drop it. When you drop nobody stops you, when you want to become a sannyasin nobody stops you.\nSo those people who are still here are never going to leave. And we had no intention about the election. That's what the commission has found, that we had no intention at all to bring those people for the election.\nQ: IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THIS SEGMENT OF THE GENERAL SOCIETY TO COEXIST WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF OREGON UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THINGS? CAN YOU GUYS GET ALONG WITH THE FOLKS OUTSIDE? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF THAT?\nA: I don't think so.\nQ: I MEAN, I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT, BUT NO MAN OR NO GROUP IS AN ISLAND, AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH. AND AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME COOPERATION IN SOMETHING. I KNOW YOU ANSWERED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE IF THERE WOULD BE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR COEXISTENCE, SAY WITH THE PEOPLE OF WHAT USED TO BE ANTELOPE, AND YOUR ANSWER WAS NO. BUT MY QUESTION IS: IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE RAJNEESHEES CAN BECOME COEXISTING, NOT SUBSERVIENT, BUT COEXIST WITH THE PEOPLE OF OREGON?\nA: No. To me the word COEXISTENCE is political, and it does not carry any good connotations with it. Coexistence means that we are enemies, but -- what to do? -- we have to get along.\nQ: CHOOSE ANOTHER WORD THEN, WHERE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, WHERE THE STATE OF OREGON IS CONCERNED, THAT THE RAJNEESHEES COULD IN FACT ACCEPT.\nA: I don't compromise on anything.\nQ: WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO COMPROMISE.\nA: No. I will make every effort to bring to the Oregonians what we are. We are exposing ourselves to all media and everybody is welcome, but we are going to remain ourselves and there is no need for any coexistence. They exist there in their way, we exist here in our own way -- PARALLEL EXISTENCE, that is my word.\nQ: PARALLEL MIGHT BE EVEN A BETTER WORD.\nA: Yes\nQ: Coexistence, I THINK, DOES DENOTE A HOSTILITY THAT IS ACCEPTED.\nA: That's it. That's why I said \"Never.\" When the question was asked about coexistence, I said, \"Never.\" But the woman did not even wait for me to explain what I wanted to say. She did not ask about the implications. She simply left. That was enough. Coexistence finished! That woman immediately left the mike, and that was really symbolic.\nQ: WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YOU AND I WOULD GET ALONG VERY WELL, AND I'D PROBABLY DOMINATE THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS.\nAT THE... AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT -- AND THESE ARE THE MECHANICAL THINGS, SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE ABOUT GOD, AND THE FACT THAT YOUR ANSWER OR RESPONSE WAS, I BELIEVE, PARAPHRASING \"HE IS MAN'S GREATEST LIE.\"\nA: Right.\nQ: OR SHE IS MAN'S GREATEST LIE -- WHICHEVER THE CASE MAY BE.\nA: Right!\nQ: THAT'S IT?\nA: Yes.\nQ: LET'S TALK AGAIN ABOUT YOUR BATHROOM!\nWHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION THAT CAME UP AT SOME POINT. I HAD\nREAD SO MUCH ABOUT RAJNEESHEES AND BHAGWAN. FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS IN THIS AREA, I HAD NOW BECOME SO INUNDATED WITH INFORMATION.… YOUR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, YOUR PUBLIC\nRELATIONS DEPARTMENT, SENT ME THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRESS KIT. IN SIXTEEN YEARS I COULD NOT READ EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THERE, BUT I TRIED! THE QUESTION THAT HAS COME UP IS THE JIM JONES PROBLEM, THE PARALLEL THAT HAS BEEN DRAWN THAT THIS IS IN FACT A RELIGIOUS FANATIC WHO IS CONTROLLING A CULT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL DO ANYTHING THAT HE DECIDES THAT THEY SHOULD DO -- WHETHER OR NOT HE DECIDES THAT. I BELIEVE YOUR ANSWER WAS SIMPLY THAT THE CHRISTIANITY FACTOR IS NOT IN EXISTENCE HERE, THAT LIFE AFTER DEATH IS BETTER THAN LIFE DURING LIFE. IS THAT THE COMPLETE ANSWER, AND IS IT NOT PROBABLY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT IN SOME RESPECTS THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED AT JONESTOWN WAS A RESULT OF PEOPLE FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL BLINDLY, AS OPPOSED TO A CHRISTIANITY QUESTION?\nA: Wait!\nIt is not only that he was a Christian priest. There is great implication in it. The whole Christianity is death-oriented; the cross is its symbol. And if Jesus was not crucified, there would have been no Christianity at all. The Jews simply missed the point. The man was nuts! They should have ignored him, he was doing no harm to anybody. To crucify that nut created Christianity. I call Christianity, CROSSIANITY. It is not Christianity.\nQ: HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO SAY BHAGWAN IS NUTS, AND IF THEY WERE TO CRUCIFY YOU WOULD THE SAME THING HAPPEN?\nA: It will happen again if they crucify me. Again there will be another Christianity, so better tell them.…\nQ: LEAVE YOU ALONE!\nA: Leave me alone!\nQ: OKAY.\nA: It is in their favor if they leave me alone. If they assassinate me, it will be in my favor.\nReverend Jim Jones had no similarity at any point with me. All his disciples were mostly black, illiterate. All my disciples are white.…\nQ: I SAW THREE BLACKS TODAY.\nA: Yes, three you can see in five thousand people. That does not make even one percent. These white people have come from all over the world, they are all well educated, most of them are graduates, a large number of them have master's degrees, many are Ph.D.s, few are D.Litts. His group and my group are poles apart.\nThose people were blindly following him, because that is what Jesus teaches. He was simply repeating Jesus' drama. Jesus is responsible.\nQ: FOR JONESTOWN?\nA: Yes. And the pope should be hanged! Q: WHO SHOULD BE...?\nA: For Jonestown -- the pope.\nQ: WELL, HE WASN'T IN OFFICE THEN. THE POPE AT THE TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANGED...?\nA: Any.\nQ: JUST PICK ONE OUT.\nA: Any will do, because he represents Jesus Christ.\nQ: BUT THEN WHY NOT HANG ALL THE PRIESTS AND THE BISHOPS AND THE CARDINALS AND THE ARCHBISHOPS...?\nA: That will be great!\nBut that's what Jesus was doing with people, his followers: \"Believe in me, have faith in me, follow me.\" And that's what Reverend Jones was doing: \"Whatever I say you have to follow.\"\nHere I am saying to my people, \"Don't believe in my statements. Think over them, argue over them. You love me -- that is another thing. That should not become your belief.\"\nQ: BUT ONE OF THE GREAT PLOYS IN THE HUMAN MIND AND MANEUVERABILITY IS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY, \"DON'T DO THAT,\" WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO DO IT EVEN MORE.\nA: So what do you want? I should say, \"Do it\"?\nQ: NO, NO. DOES THAT NOT PUT AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU TO HAVE THIS KIND OF DEVOTION?\nA: No. Because I have been consistently denying to them, telling them, almost every day for thirty years, that I am not your leader, that I am not a prophet, that I am not a messiah, that I am not the only begotten son of God -- I am just an ordinary man as you are, with a slight difference: you are asleep, I am awake. But that is not much of a difference. I can just shake you a little and you will be awake.\nI have been telling them that I don't have any dogma to give them, any belief system to give them. Christians have told me that I should publish a catechism in which my whole doctrine is presented in short, but that is impossible. I have 360 books and I have contradicted myself thousands of times, because to me, consistency is something that belongs to the stupid, unintelligent, retarded. A consciousness which goes on growing is bound to contradict at each step the step that preceded it.\nThey cannot make any belief out of my books, out of my teachings. They can love me, and love is not adoration. Adoration is for somebody who is higher than you. Now I am doing my hardest to tell them that I am not higher, but I don't take any responsibility if they don't listen. If somebody adores me, that is his responsibility, not mine. If somebody thinks he is my follower, that is his idea, not mine. I am not responsible for anybody. I am only responsible for myself, and I want my people to be responsible for themselves.\nQ: IS ANYONE HERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE?\nA: No, nobody is responsible for anybody else.\nQ: IS ANYONE IN THE WORLD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE?\nA: In fact they should not be. Only politicians and priests have been exploiting people and saying \"We are responsible for you. We take the responsibility.\" That is a strategy to make them enslaved. The priest says, \"Don't be bothered. You just follow the Christian dogma, have faith in Jesus Christ and you will be saved.\" They are taking their responsibility. Jesus was taking the responsibility for saving the whole of mankind, and he has not been seen for two thousand years -- what a great savior!\nI am nobody's savior. I have saved myself, that's enough. Q: QUITE LUXURIOUSLY TOO.\nA: Quite luxuriously, because I don't believe in any ascetic ideas. My idea about asceticism is that it is a psychological sickness, it is masochism. It is torturing yourself, and in a sick mind you can enjoy torturing yourself\nThere are two kinds of torturers: the sadist who tortures somebody else and enjoys, and the masochist who tortures himself and enjoys. Both kinds of people fit together very beautifully. The best couple in the world will be a sadist husband, a masochist wife, or vice versa. Both will be of great.…\nQ: A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN, RIGHT?\nA: Yes, a marriage made in heaven, because one will enjoy torturing the other and the other will enjoy being tortured. So that is perfect, the best marriage I can conceive.\nI am not a masochist, hence I enjoy everything that life can give to me. And I am not a sadist, so I don't tell any of my people to torture themselves in any way: enjoy to the fullest. And I don't give them any promises.\nJust see the difference: I don't give any promises for their future, after death, that they will be benefited, rewarded -- I don't even talk about the future, I simply talk about this moment. I cannot believe how people can even think of me in reference to Reverend Jones and Jonestown. This is just the opposite place.\nHere we love, we live, we live to totality, and we try to squeeze every moment to the very last drop of its juice. I have never ordered them in anything.\nAnd as far as death is concerned, I am life-affirmative. I want death to disappear from the earth, and there is a possibility if the idiotic politicians don't go on wasting scientific genius in piling up nuclear weapons. There is a possibility, very commonly accepted by biologists, that a man can live for three hundred years very easily, and without any old age.\nIn India I have seen people, in a small part of Kashmir which is now under Pakistan -- they have invaded that part; it is a very small place, a few thousand people -- who live for 150 or 160 years. The oldest man in that community was 180 years old when I went there, and he was working in the field!\nI asked him, \"How long have you worked?\" He said, \"I don't know how to count. People say that I have been working here for at least 150 years. When I was thirty, my father died, and since then I have been working.\" And he was still young!\nThere are hundreds of people in the Soviet Union who have reached beyond 150; they also are middle Asian, from the other side of the Himalayas. Scientists think that three hundred years is very easily possible, and if more efforts are made, we can postpone death as long as possible.\nUnless a man wants to die -- because who would like to live for one thousand years? Perhaps.…\nQ: I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE GUY OF 185 WOULD WANT TO KEEP LIVING WHILE HE'S WORKING IN THE FIELDS.\nA: You cannot. It is difficult to believe when you.…\nQ: THEN WE'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THIS PLANET. THE ENTIRE PLANET WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED.\nA: No, nothing. All that we have to change is the way we have been producing children -- only that has to be changed, nothing else, because the father's cell and the mother's egg have the program for the whole life. The meeting of those two decides the whole life of the person: how long he will live, what kind of nose he will have, what color of hair, what color of skin, what kind of diseases he will have, when he will die. The whole program is in the first two genes.\nThe only thing that bioengineering has to do is to change the program. And they ARE capable, they are saying they are capable of changing the whole program, that the child will not have any old age, that the child will live three hundred years, that he will not be vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, infections, that he will have the highest I.Q., intelligence possible.\nQ: WOULD THAT BE, IN YOUR MIND, A HEALTHY WORLD?\nA: It will be for the first time healthy. Up to now it has been just a sick and mad world. It will be really healthy when there are no diseases.…\nQ: WELL, WOULD YOU DO AWAY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONSTRUCTING GENES AND THE DNA PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE, AND PROCREATION AND THE ENTIRE PICTURE -- WOULD YOU DO AWAY WITH EGOS, WOULD YOU DO AWAY WITH THE COMPETITIVE FACTOR? COULD YOU DO AWAY WITH ALL OF THE NEGATIVES LIKE JEALOUSY, LIKE GREED AND THINGS LIKE THAT?\nA: Yes. That can be done.\nQ: SO YOU'RE REALLY TALKING THEN ABOUT A GENEALOGICAL, BIONIC PERSON, CONSTRUCTED?\nA: Certainly. And that will be the dream of all those people who for centuries have been thinking of a superman.\nQ: DOES THE WORLD REALLY WANT A SUPERMAN?\nA: This world does not deserve it.\nQ: BUT THIS IS WHERE IT HAS TO START, OR AT LEAST WHERE OUR LIFETIME IS CONCERNED.\nA: It needs it.\nQ: THIS IS NOT \"THE PRICE IS RIGHT\" AND YOU SUDDENLY OPEN THE CURTAIN AND THERE IS A SUPERMAN -- IT'S THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS.…\nA: Very simple. Within twenty years -- because one generation of twenty-year- old young people, supermen moving around, not hippies -- you will see the difference. Within twenty years -- it is not a question of a very long time. And when we can give the child the intelligence of an Einstein, we can give him the aesthetic sense of a van Gogh, we can give him a face as beautiful as Alexander the Great or Cleopatra, why should we go on living with this mediocre, biological, accidental world?\nAnd it is strange that whenever I mention it to people, they raise the question that it will be something inhuman, mechanical, but about other things they don't bother. When you have cancer, then you don't say,\"It is natural. Leave it, don't do anything, because that operation is going to be mechanical, that operation is going to be technological, and this beautiful cancer in me is natural.\"\nWhen we are ready to take man-made medicines for our diseases -- and diseases come from nature -- nobody bothers about it, everybody is willing for medicines, operations, surgeries.\nQ: WELL, THEY ACCEPT IT TO HEAL, BUT NOT TO CREATE.\nA: That is just the next step! If so much healing is needed, why not create a man who needs no healing?\nQ: I DON'T KNOW IF I BUY ALL OF THAT PART OF IT. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT... I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY TO START ACCEPTING.… WE'VE GONE FROM YOUR BATHROOM TO CREATING SUPERMAN AND THAT IS A GIANT, QUANTUM LEAP FOR ME.\nA: It is!\nQ: AND FOR MOST PEOPLE?\nA: No. Not for my people! They are accustomed to\nQ: BUT WE'RE BACK TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT BHAGWAN SAYS.…\nA: No. That is not the way. They have been listening to me and they know that I give them every day a quantum leap that they have never expected. And they have been with me for a decade or two decades, and they had not been expecting that I will say this. They go on waiting for tomorrow morning.\nQ: AND THEN THEY SAY, \"WHAT HAS HE GOT FOR US TODAY?\"\nA: Yes!\nQ: COUPLE OF THINGS, POPULAR QUESTIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NEWSPAPER REPORTS, TELEVISION, RADIO, ANY OTHER FORM OF MEDIA THAT THERE MAY BE, THAT THE RAJNEESH EMPIRE -- YOU EXCUSE MY WORD -- IS CRUMBLING, THAT THERE ARE MAJOR DEFECTIONS, SOME OF THE CORPORATIONS ARE NOT DOING AS WELL FINANCIALLY, AND SUSTAINING THEMSELVES AS IT HAD APPEARED THEY WERE. TRUE OR FALSE?\nA: It is all wrong. But those people need some consolations. People who are hostile to us need some consolations. If these things give them consolations, good. But everything is wrong -- my empire is increasing every day.\nQ: WELL, PROBABLY IT'S BECAUSE YOUR RESTAURANT CLOSED IN PORTLAND, DID IT NOT?\nA: We closed it not because we are shrinking; we closed it because we wanted our people to be here.\nQ: DIDN'T BUSINESS GET A LITTLE BAD?\nA: No, our business is increasing so much in Europe that we have to send people from here to Europe.\nQ: DIDN'T YOU HAVE A BUSINESS THAT JUST WENT BANKRUPT SOMEWHERE?\nA: Nowhere!\nQ: I WONDER WHO I WAS READING ABOUT. WHERE DO THEY GET THESE REPORTS?\nA: These reports come to you or to the newspapers and they make big headlines out of them. If a sannyasin has a business of his own and he goes bankrupt, that does not mean that my empire is going bankrupt.\nQ: BUT IT DOES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOUR EMPIRE IS NOT SUCCEEDING.\nA: They can go on dreaming.\nQ: IS THIS AN EMPIRE? IS THAT A QUOTE?\nA: It is certainly an empire!\nQ: I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I CHOSE THE RIGHT WORD.\nA: It is the right word.\nQ: I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT WHEN SOMEONE ASKED YOU AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE OVER ALL OF OREGON AND YOU SAID NO, IT WAS TOO SMALL, YOU WANTED THE WORLD, THEY PROBABLY TOOK YOU SERIOUSLY. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BHAGWAN?\nA: I was serious!\nQ: ARE YOU INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD?\nA: Certainly!\nQ: WHEN CAN WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO TAKE PLACE? ANTELOPE TODAY, THE WORLD TOMORROW?\nA: No. We are not going to take the world the way we have taken Antelope. This is nothing. We are going to take the world over in a totally different way which is not political at all. We are increasing our people all around the world. We will take it over spiritually. We are not interested in politics. They forced us to take that dead town, Antelope, they FORCED us to take it.\nQ: HAD THEY NOT FORCED YOU -- AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I WANTED TO CLARIFY IT -- HAD THEY NOT FORCED YOU, WOULD YOU HAVE GIVEN IT BACK?\nA: Now, no.\nQ: I THOUGHT YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. NOT NOW. I MEAN, HAD THEY COOPERATED.\nA: Things have gone. In the beginning if they had cooperated there would have\nbeen no question of us taking it, because it is unnecessary trouble for us. We have our own work to do, we need more people here; we don't want our people to live in Antelope, because it is unnecessary trouble. Every morning they have to be brought here, every evening they have to be sent back.\nQ: THEY'D NEVER HAVE TO DISPLAY THEIR COURAGE TO ME, RIDING THAT ROAD TWO TIMES A DAY, EVERY DAY.\nA: It is something, because this road, this county road, is worse than the road that goes to hell!\nQ: I CANNOT YET SPEAK FROM PERSONAL AUTHORIZATION ON THAT.\nA: I can, because I visited.\nQ: I WILL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. IS THERE A HEAVEN AND IS THERE A HELL? AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME WHAT PART OF OREGON THEY ARE BOTH IN?\nA: You are sitting in heaven and the county road goes to hell!\nQ: YOU ARE A MAN WHO CERTAINLY, THERE IS NO DOUBT, LOVES THE CONTROVERSY THAT SURROUNDS YOU.\nA: I love it.\nQ: YOU ARE A MAN WHO I THINK WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EVERY HUMAN BEING IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD AT LEAST TO HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOU.\nA: Certainly. I would like the entire world either to love me or hate me; I would not like a single individual in the whole world to ignore me. And that's the way my empire is expanding. I have more friends, I have more enemies -- every day they are increasing.\nQ: YOU ARE ALSO A MAN WITH, WITHOUT QUESTION, A MAGNIFICENT SENSE OF HUMOR. AND IN ORDER TO RULE THIS EMPIRE -- NOT RULE, I'M SORRY... YOU DO NOT RULE; YOU JUST LIVE IN THIS EMPIRE -- TO\nACCEPT ALL OF THE HASSLES AND CONTROVERSIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS AND PROBABLY SOME OF THE TRUTHS ABOUT YOURSELF, YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.\nA: I really enjoy.…\nQ: LET ME STOP YOU ONE SECOND. I READ IN THE OFFICE, IN THE WELCOME ROOM -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?... THE VISITORS CENTER -- THAT IF THE WORLD COULD LAUGH, IF EVERYONE IN THE WORLD COULD LAUGH OVER A TWENTY-FOUR HOUR PERIOD IT WOULD CHANGE THIS ENTIRE MALIGNANCY THAT WE ALL SEEM TO LIVE IN. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID; THAT'S WHAT I SAID.\nA: It will help, but it will kill that woman. Laughter is good medicine, but you\nshould take as much as you can absorb; otherwise it can kill you, it can drive you mad.\nLife is a very mysterious phenomenon where laughter is part and where tears also are part. Once in a while to be sad, really sad, is not bad. Sadness has its own beauty. You have just to learn to enjoy the beauty of sadness, its silence, its depth.\nLife is everything all together, and we allow our people to live in all dimensions. If somebody is crying and weeping, nobody is going to stop him here. Somebody may give him a hug and go on his way. That hug was not to stop his tears, but just a spontaneous response.\nWe believe in life in its totality, in its days, in its nights, the sunny days and the cloudy days. We believe that everything in life can be enjoyed. You need just a little more awareness, more consciousness of what is happening. You are not your mind, you are not your body. There is a witness somewhere inside you who can go on looking at the mind, at the emotions, at the physiological reactions. That witness is you. And that witness is capable of enjoying everything, once you get centered there.\nMy whole method of meditation is to get centered at your witness, and then let life and its games go on. Enjoy, laugh, cry, but whatever you do, do it totally, with no shame, with no guilt.\nAnd, as you said, I am certainly a man who enjoys being controversial. I cannot conceive a man who has any guts not being controversial. The people who are not controversial are simply hypocrites -- just goody-goody, nice to everybody, just changing their masks the whole day, to fit with everybody.\nOne American, Dale Carnegie, has written a book, HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE. My idea is \"How to Influence People and Create Enemies.\"\nQ: WHY? WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, BY COMPARISON, TO CREATE ENEMIES?\nA: Because if you can create an enemy, you have created a potential friend. I will tell you one old Hassidic story.\nHassids are not traditional Jews. Jews don't accept Hassids as religious for the same reason that nobody will accept my people as religious: the Hassids sing and dance and enjoy and eat and drink.\nThis Hassid sent one of his disciples to the chief rabbi of Jerusalem to present him the first copy of his book that had just been published. And he said to the disciple, \"When you give it to him, remember, give it to him, not to anybody else. You have to be very alert and watch what he says, remember exactly every word; what he does, remember exactly his acts.\"\nThe disciple went. The chief rabbi was sitting in his garden -- it was a beautiful evening, the sun was just setting -- and the wife of the rabbi was also sitting there. He presented the book of his Master and said, \"It is my Master's book's first edition and this is the first book that has come off the press. Out of great gratitude he sends it to you.\"\nThe chief rabbi said, \"That Hassid? He has some guts to send me his book.\" He took the book from his hand and threw it over the fence into the street. The wife said to him, \"This is not right. You could have thrown that book when the disciple had gone, or you could have put it in the library where you have thousands of books. What harm could that book have done to you?\"\nThe disciple came back and he said, \"That chief rabbi is just a rotten man! He is not even a gentleman. You send him a present and he throws it with such hatred over the fence into the street. But his wife is certainly a woman worth respecting. She suggested to him,'You could have thrown it afterwards. Why hurt him? Or you could have just put it in your library where there are thousands of books. What harm could that book have done to your library?' \"\nThe Master said to the disciple, \"I am going to convert that rabbi one day, but his wife is beyond me.\"\nQ: WHAT KIND OF A MAN ARE YOU? NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT -- WHAT YOUR THINKING IS.\nA: Just crazy, nothing.\nQ: JUST A CRAZY OLD MAN? SOMEHOW I FELT THAT YOU WOULD ANSWER SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nA: It is a fact!\nQ: WHEN YOU SAY, \"JUST A CRAZY MAN...\" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nA: Exactly what it means.\nQ: MENTALLY DERANGED? A: No.\nQ: WELL, IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CRAZY, TO SOME, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.\nA: No. Crazy simply means one who has gone out of his mind. Now, two types of people go out of their minds. One is the madman that you know ordinarily as crazy; another is the meditator. He also goes out of his mind, but going out of his mind he goes higher, to the witness. The madman going out of the mind goes lower, to the mind. Both are crazy! I belong to the first category.\nQ: TOMORROW I'M GOING TO TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN YOUR CITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. AFTER THAT I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE FORMER AND CURRENT RESIDENTS OF OUR FAVORITE SUBJECT, ANTELOPE.\nA: Good!\nQ: IF YOU WERE TO WANT ME TO SAY SOMETHING TO THEM DURING THIS CONVERSATION -- NONE OF WHOM I'VE MET -- WHAT WOULD IT BE, IF ANYTHING?\nA: No. I have nothing to say to them, because I don't consider they will be able to understand anything. I have seen idiots around the world, but Antelope simply defeats all the idiots. You will come across them tomorrow!\nQ: BHAGWAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I HAVE ENJOYED IT. I THINK YOU ENJOYED IT TOO.\nA: I enjoyed even more! Q: THANK YOU!\nA: Good!\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #19 Chapter title: Half Of Humanity 5 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament, Volume 1, as Chapter 30.]\nCarlo Silvestro\n(Swami Swatantra Sarjano) PANORAMA\nMILAN, ITALY\nQUESTION: I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR MAGAZINE, WHICH IS A WEEKLY MAGAZINE IN ITALY WITH A REPUTATION OF AN OPINION MAKER, LIKE NEWSWEEK IN AMERICA. SINCE IT IS THE FIRST TIME ANY ITALIAN JOURNALIST HAS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WE WILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ALL OF THEM FOR OUR READERS.\nTHE FIRST QUESTION IS: YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT A PROPHET, YOU ARE NOT A MESSIAH, YOU ARE NOT A GOD, YOU ARE NOT A SAINT. SO WE WANT TO KNOW, WHO ARE YOU?\nANSWER: Is it necessary for anyone to be a messiah, to be a prophet, to be a son of God? Cannot one just be a human being? I am simply a human being as everybody else is, with a very little difference: I am awake and others are asleep. It may look like a great difference to the person who is asleep, but to the awakened there is no difference at all. Just a little shaking, shocking, and the asleep one will be awake and they both can laugh at the whole stupid game of Master and disciple, of messiah... of the savior and the saved. Except laughter there will be nothing, because they will know that they are both exactly the same. And because these names -- prophet, messiah, incarnation of God -- have been used in the past to exploit people, to create bondage for their spirits, for their psyches, these names have divided people into different religions and the result was thousands of wars. Five thousand wars in three thousand years... crusades in the name of God, people killing thousands of other people, burning people alive in the name of God, and with the authority that they are the representative of the messiah or the prophet or the successor.\nI don't want to be in this company of criminals. I want simply to be an ordinary human being -- that's what I am.\nQ: IN ANY CASE, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE A BIG POWER?\nA: I don't have any power. I have love, big love, but love knows no power. Power is desired by those who are incapable of love. Only the loveless become politicians, power hungry. They think that if they have power over people perhaps their desire for love will be fulfilled. It is never fulfilled. No politician dies contented. It is impossible -- he has gone wrong from the very beginning. The path of power leads farther away from yourself, and from love. The path of love brings you closer home to yourself\nI have immense love to give, inexhaustible love to give, but no power to order or command or tell somebody to be this, be that. I don't give any ten commandments.\nQ: WHY HAVE YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HERE? DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE, TO TRAVEL?\nA: No. I have always been a guest wherever I was, because I belong to the whole universe. So anywhere I am, that particular place is only a guest house. I am not planning to leave -- I never plan. I can leave any moment, I may not leave ever.\nQ: YOU SAID, \"I MUST CHOOSE, I PREFER TO BE ZORBA RATHER THAN BUDDHA.\" WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\nA: It means that Zorba is the foundation and Buddha is the palace. Buddha is the peak, but the foundation stones are laid by Zorba. It will be foolish to choose to be a Buddha without having the foundation stones.\nI am absolutely mathematical about it: Zorba should be there and the stronger a Zorba is there, the better a Buddha is possible. So I can become Buddha any moment, Zorba is absolutely needed as the basic energy out of which the Buddha is going to be carved. Zorba is the marble rock out of which the Buddha statue has to be carved. I choose the rock... and Buddha is easy.\nIt is just a question of opening your eyes. I don't bother about Buddha; I am worried about people who are not Zorbas. How will they become Buddhas? They don't have the basic material out of which a Buddha is made.\nAnd this poverty has been given to people by our religious leaders. They have been told not to be materialists. They have been told to be celibate. They have been told to live in poverty. They have been told that life is out of sin. All these things have destroyed their Zorbas. Otherwise, every man is a born Zorba the Greek.\nAnd if everything goes according to me, every man will die as Zorba the Buddha. Between the Greek and the Buddha there is not much distance, but first you must be the Greek.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH PEOPLE? ARE YOU AS RICH AS MANY OF YOUR SANNYASINS? YOUR CRITICS -- AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- SAY THAT YOU COLLECT MONEY JUST AS YOU COLLECT THE ROLLS ROYCES AND THE WATCHES. ARE YOU AGAINST THE POOR?\nA: First, I collect nothing. There is not a single thing that I possess. For thirty years I have been the poorest man in the world. And on the judgment day, if there is a line you will find me in the front, ahead of Jesus Christ.\nBut my people who love me are there. That is my possession, that makes me rich. Their love is more to me than power over the whole world. I would not like to become Alexander the Great. Out of their love, whatsoever they want to do, they do.\nIf they want me to have Rolls Royces, they are free. If they want me to have diamond watches, they are free. They know my taste, and for that simple reason my people can manage to offer me everything that not even a king or queen is capable of having.\nThe reason is very simple: whatever I teach can be understood only by the very intelligent and creative people. So only the cream of intelligence comes close to me.\nI am against poverty and against the poor. I don't want any poverty, any poor people in the world. I am not in agreement with Jesus that the poor are the blessed; they are the cursed, they shall inherit the kingdom of hell. There is no need for anybody to be poor. We have enough intelligence, we have everything that can make the whole earth a beautiful garden. But politicians will not allow it to happen; priests will not allow it to happen, because if the garden of Eden can be created here, then what is going to happen to their paradise, their God, their hell and all the business that goes on around those bogus words which mean nothing?\nPoliticians would not like that there are no poor people in the world. If there are no poor people in the world, communism will lose all hold immediately. If there are no poor people in the world, it will not be easy for the capitalists to exploit anybody. In the capitalist countries, the capitalist wants there to be poor people because they can be purchased easily. In India you can purchase any vote for two rupees; that is the highest price for any vote. Now what kind of democracy can exist where you can purchase a vote for two rupees?\nThe rich people want the poor to exist, the priest wants the poor to exist, because without the poor, who is going to go to the church? The rich people have their Rotary Clubs, their Lion's Clubs, the Club of Rome -- who is going to the church? The priest wants the crippled, retarded, blind, sick, old, starving, all kinds of people who are not wanted at all. The priest needs them; otherwise, who is going to gather around Billy Graham?\nIf there are not orphans, who is going to give a Nobel prize to Mother Teresa? These people are exploiting. With all the scientific and technological developments in the twentieth century, I am saying that it is absurd to allow poverty to exist for even a single moment more.\nQ: WE'VE BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS NOW AND THE COMMUNE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL. YOUR WORDS ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL, TOO. WHAT I AM ASKING MYSELF NOW IS, HOW COME THE PRESS AND THE OREGONIANS ARE SO UNUSUALLY AGGRESSIVE AGAINST YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE?\nA: Because I want them to be aggressive. They are simply following my wishes. If they are not aggressive, then there is not much hope. If they are aggressive, we can put them right.\nTheir being aggressive is their first step towards friendship. They may not understand, but I understand it. For my whole life I have been creating enemies and turning enemies into friends. And in fact it is better this way, rather than vice-versa: you put all your energy into creating a friend and then he becomes your enemy. That is sheer wastage. The better thing is to put your whole energy into creating enemies, and then let them turn into your friends. And they are bound to turn, because whatsoever they are carrying is absurd. The moment they come to know the truth, they will become your friends.\nAnd it is a simple psychology: the deeper their hate, the deeper will be their love, in the same proportion. I do not believe in people like Dale Carnegie. I work just in the opposite way, and you can see my business is succeeding. And where is Dale Carnegie? And how many people has he turned into friends?\nI want the whole earth, the whole humanity to be divided in two camps -- no more Russian, no more American -- either they hate me or they love me, but both ways they are connected with me, and I love both of them. They are like the two wheels the bullock cart moves on; they are not aware that they are playing into my hands.\nQ: YOU SAID, \"I AM A SIMPLE MAN.\" BUT WHY DO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, SIMPLE MEN, FOLLOW A SIMPLE MAN?\nA: Because it is very difficult to find a simple man. Nobody is simple, everybody thinks himself extraordinary. He may not have the guts to say it -- that's another matter -- but everybody, deep down, thinks himself to be the most superior, the most beautiful, the most intelligent person in the world. And if he is not succeeding, it is because the whole world is hostile to him, everybody is preventing him. Otherwise, he would be on top of Everest.\nI am a simple man with no ambition to be anybody other than I am, and these people have been attracted towards me just because of my simplicity, humanity.\nThey have fallen in love with an innocent man who has no secrets and no privacy, who is absolutely open, available.\nYou cannot find people open, available, innocent, simple. Even the most idiotic people think they are great geniuses. I am not a genius, just an average, ordinary person.\nQ: DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF PERSONAL STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE, ANY MESSAGE TO LEAVE? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF RAJNEESHISM AND RAJNEESHPURAM AFTER YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCCESSOR?\nA: No, because all the religions who have followed those lines have turned poisonous, have turned into curses on humanity. I don't want to be a curse to humanity. I am a blessing and I want to remain a blessing.\nSo nobody is going to succeed me.\nAnd my message for my people is that the moment I am gone, your religion is gone. Then whatever remains is just a corpse. Don't start worshipping the corpse. I am a free man and I want every sannyasin to be a free man. My love is the only binding force between them; otherwise, there is no theology, no belief system, no agreement on anything.\nOnly one thing is keeping them together around the world, and that is their love for me. When I am not there, nothing can keep them together. There is no bridge. Each sannyasin is individually connected to me. You don't ask the sun, \"If one day you stop rising, what is going to happen to the rays?\" You know that the rays will not be there the moment I am dead and gone.\nThey have lived with me, they have danced with me, they have enjoyed with me\n-- now they know the secret of how to enjoy life, how to live life. And there is no need to go on making a church, popes, successors... because they have done so much harm. I will not allow my people to do that.\nWhen I am gone, then you disperse. What is the point? my love was keeping you together, and I am no more there. It is good that I am no more, because now your last attachment is also dropped. I was the last attachment to be broken, now you are totally free. You were free from your family, from your nation, from your religion, but a small thin thread of love was binding you with me. Now I am no more there; I give you the last, the final taste of freedom.\nAnd then whatever happens, happens. I am not responsible for it. The people who will be coming after me will have the responsibility. And I never think about the future. I am so totally involved with the present... I am talking to you, and at this moment only you exist for me. The whole space has disappeared and the whole time has stopped. Just you and me... only then can there be some communication.\nAnd I don't think about what is going to happen tomorrow. I am not thinking what you are going to write about me, and I am not going to read it, whatever\nyou write! It doesn't matter at all. What matters is that we enjoyed this moment together, loved this moment, laughed together, felt each other's humanity.\nI cannot see anybody as a journalist, as a doctor, as an engineer. Those are not your realities, they are just your jobs. When I look at you, I put aside your journalist, I am talking directly to you. Journalism is just your way of earning bread and butter. What importance does it have? I cannot love bread and butter, but I love you as a person, as an individual, and whatsoever I am saying is totally different from what you would have found in the past with the many other people you have interviewed. Even in the future you may not come across a man like me.\nMy whole interest in this moment is how to help you enjoy the time you have been with me. Your magazine, your writing, does not come between me and you, so when you started introducing the magazine, I was going to stop you, but just out of politeness I listened. What concern do I have with magazines, newspapers?\nMy concern is purely with the individual, and then it is up to him. Whatsoever he wants to make out of it, he will make out of it. I trust in my love, and I trust in the dignity of the individual that is sitting before me, and the trust will take care of everything. I never think of tomorrow.\nQ: BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE SANNYASINS LIVING HERE, FOR THE LIFE AND THE FUTURE OF THE CHILDREN I HAVE SEEN IN THIS CITY?\nA: I am not responsible for anybody. I am not even a member of this commune. I live outside the City of Rajneeshpuram. And I am not a sannyasin, as you can see. It is the commune's responsibility. I am very irresponsible.\nWhen I was leaving the university, one girl used to love me. But just the way girls are -- and particularly in India -- she was shy, and I am not the one to chase anybody. I do chasing sitting in my chair... I am just a lazy man. She loved me; and continuously she was sending messages to me. She wanted to get married to me. Then the day of departure came and we were leaving. We had passed our final examinations and then she could not contain it any more.\nShe pulled me aside and told me, \"I have loved you for two years, but I had not the courage to say it. And you are a strange man... I made so many efforts and so many messages, and you just remained as if I am not here.\"\nI said, \"You do not know. It is just out of compassion that I have remained that way, because I am a very irresponsible man. I may marry you, and tomorrow morning I may forget all about you. I may give birth to children and then I will not bother at all what happens to you and your children.\"\nJust out of compassion, I kept out of it. It is enough that I am carrying my own responsibility towards myself That's why I have never accepted any responsibility for anything.\nIndia's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wanted me to join politics. I was introduced to him by India's very old seniormost parliamentarian, who had been a member of parliament from 1916 up to 1976. He was known as the father of the Indian parliament. Jawaharlal used to stay at his palace -- his father was given the title of rajah, king, so his house had become the palace, and it was palatial.\nAnd Jawaharlal was a man of tremendous intelligence. He talked just for five to ten minutes with me and he said, \"You'd better join politics. You don't waste your time here and there, you have a great future and I am with you and I will support you.\"\nI said, \"Thank you for your generosity, but I am not going to be in any position where I am responsible for anybody.\"\nPolitics means responsibility, and if you are not responsible you have to become a hypocrite. That's what all the politicians have become. They talk about being responsible and nobody is responsible.\nNow, millions of tons of food in Europe have been thrown in the ocean, but they will not send it to Ethiopia. One hundred thousand dollars were needed to take it to the ocean, and they dumped it there -- fresh fruit, fresh food. But its presence was going to bring the prices down, and that they would not like. And who cares about Ethiopia? And why should anybody care?\nIn speeches, everybody will talk about Ethiopia and responsibility, but the real face is totally different. The prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is one of my friends. He is Jawaharlal's grandson. If I had accepted Jawaharlal's offer, perhaps I would have been in his place. He is selling wheat to other countries while half of India is starving and dying.\nAnd they go on talking about sympathy and compassion for the poor... but he needs nuclear weapons. For that he needs money, and India has only raw materials to sell. It has no technology, no high technology. The poor man works his whole life producing wheat and dies starving while the wheat will be sold to purchase uranium to make nuclear weapons.\nI don't take anybody's responsibility. In this way I help whoever comes close to me to be responsible for himself. People who take others' responsibility are responsible for creating retarded, dependent slaves all around the world. If nobody had taken their responsibility, they would have taken the challenge of life and struggled for themselves.\nI have heard about a very super-rich woman. She had come to a holiday resort, to the best hotel. Her boy, who looked perfectly young and healthy, was carried from the car on a stretcher. Even the hotel manager and others thought that there must be something wrong. The young man looked perfectly healthy, in the best of health. They said, \"What is wrong with this young man? What has happened?\" She said, \"Nothing has happened, but he can afford to be carried on a stretcher. Why should he walk?\"\nNow, this woman thinks she is making the life of the boy luxurious, but she is crippling him. He may become crippled, he may not ever be able to walk. Somebody took the whole responsibility.\nIt is a known fact that in the whole history of humanity, not a single genius has come from superrich families. And the reason is simple. All that he wanted was available, there was no challenge. When there is no challenge intelligence goes out of function, it is not needed.\nIt is strange. It should have been otherwise. The richer people should have given birth to better geniuses, better Einsteins, better painters, musicians, poets, but they have just given birth to buffalos.\nI don't take anybody's responsibility, because I love people and I have compassion enough not to take their responsibility on my shoulders. They have to take their own responsibility.\nQ: I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO OUR READERS WHO THE SANNYASINS ARE. IS THE SANNYASIN A SORT OF NEW MAN? YOU SAY THAT THE SANNYASINS ARE INNOCENT CHILDREN. YOUR CRITICS SAY THAT THEY ARE YOUR SLAVES, SLAVES OF YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS WORK, LIFE, LOVE, SEX. MAY WE HAVE YOUR OPINION OF THE SANNYASINS?\nA: I don't care at all what the critics say. They all can go to hell -- the sooner the better. But I can tell you about my sannyasins.\nI don't have any dogma that they can follow. I have no philosophy that they can live. I don't have any catechism that they have to repeat and cram.\nBeing with me, all that happens is a very delicate deprogramming, and once a person is deprogrammed I don't have any program for him. In fact, my sannyasins are simply losing what they have, and I am not going to replace it with with anything. They will lose Christianity, they will lose Hinduism, and I will not replace it with another program. I will leave them to themselves.\nThey are not my slaves; neither am I their slave. Slavery is a very strange phenomenon, it is a double-edged sword. The master is dependent on the slaves as much as the slaves are dependent on the masters.\nI am nobody's slave, nobody is my slave, because I know that if you create a slave, you become a slave immediately. My sannyasins cannot even expect anything from me for the simple reason that I never expect anything from them. When I said that I am not celibate because I am not unnatural, a few sannyasins were shocked. They started writing letters to me, and I informed them that they cannot have any expectations about me. I can do anything I want. We don't have any contract that I will follow your expectations or you will follow mine.\nI have no contract of any kind. My sannyasins cannot expect what I am going to do tomorrow. I can do anything, and they also are absolutely free. They can do anything they want: they can be here, they can leave. It is their freedom.\nOut of freedom they have become sannyasins, out of freedom they can become non-sannyasins. There is no problem. It is not a church and it is not some contract which has always existed between the leader and the follower, the Master and the disciple. But this delicate thing is rarely understood -- that they both become dependent on each other.\nI am reminded of a beautiful story about Diogenes. Greece has given a few beautiful people to the world, but none comparable to Diogenes. He is not much mentioned in the history of philosophies or even if he is mentioned, it is only in the footnotes -- for the simple reason that the man was so rebellious and such an outsider that the professors of philosophy would find it difficult to explain the man and his behavior.\nHe lived naked. Now, in India it is a tradition, there are many naked sannyasins. But in Greece, he was the only one in the whole of history who lived naked. Just like Buddha in India, he used to carry a begging bowl to beg food or to drink water.\nOne day he was thirsty. It was hot and he was rushing towards the river to fill his begging bowl with cool water. Just before he was going to dip his begging bowl, a dog came running in and started drinking. He stopped, for a moment he thought, and he said, \"This dog seems to be more independent than me. I have to depend on this begging bowl. If a dog can manage without a begging bowl, then Diogenes is going to manage it, too.\"\nHe immediately threw the begging bowl into the river. Even in small things -- what to say about human beings -- when you make human beings your slave, you are entering into a mutual slavery, a mutual dependence.\nI have no contract with my people. I have not promised them that I should be this or that, so they can never question my behavior. I remain individual; and that's what I want them to remain, individual.\nNow, the persons who were shocked when I said I am not celibate had carried the idea for centuries that a religious person should be celibate -- and particularly nobody has heard that an enlightened man had made love to any woman after his enlightenment. Naturally they were shocked.\nIt is up to them. They can think that perhaps I am not enlightened. Perhaps it is time for them to leave this place. Perhaps they have come to a wrong person. But as far as I am concerned, I am going to be totally free, absolutely frank, no secrecy, no privacy.\nI know for certain that celibacy is unnatural unless you are impotent; and I don't think any impotent person has ever become enlightened. No, there is no mention of it. In fact, just the opposite is the case. The people who became enlightened were really too much sexual, that's why I call them Zorbas; they were really too much sexual -- so much that finally they understood that there is nothing much in it. They experienced it through and through and found nothing in it. And that was the point from where they started searching for something else. That led them towards Buddhahood, enlightenment.\nBut once they had become enlightened -- they were fulfilling people's expectations because they wanted to be great enlightened Masters, prophets, messiahs -- they could go on fooling with women. Buddha would not even look at a woman. What cowardliness! Buddha would not allow any woman close to him, she had to remain eight feet away.\nIs this enlightenment? so afraid, so shaky that even a woman coming close and you become afraid? This is repression, this is not enlightenment.\nI want to declare to the whole world that unenlightened people can have only sexual relationships, which they call love. This is not right. They should stop calling it making love; they are simply making sex. Only an enlightened person can make love, because it is no more his need. He can be without it for years and not even for a single moment will he feel its need. But he can enjoy it as fun.\nI can play cards; it is not a need. I can drink once in a while; it does not disturb my enlightenment. I can make love. I don't see... but it can disturb people's idea of enlightenment. That is their business. My enlightenment is not made of such fragile matter. It cannot be disturbed by anything. In fact, they have been asking whether enlightened people transcend sex, and I have sent the answer to them that the enlightened person finally transcends enlightenment, too.\nAnd I have transcended enlightenment, too. Now I am again the same old ordinary man I was before all this round trip jet journey. I am back home.\nI have passed through everything, all meditation, all enlightenment, and come back home, with new eyes, new clarity, new vision. It is almost like living continuously on LSD.\nQ: WHY ARE SO MANY WOMEN SANNYASINS?\nA: Because I am a man, and it is natural for women to be attracted to me. You can see my grey beard. This beautiful grey beard is the work of the ladies. The whole credit goes to them; otherwise, I would be having a black beard by this time. But so many ladies... but I don't bother about the color of the beard -- the grey is so beautiful!\nQ: IT SEEMS THE WHOLE COMMUNE IS RUN BY WOMEN. IS THERE A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR STRATEGY TO THAT?\nA: Certainly there is a particular strategy. Man has dominated women for centuries and forced the idea on them that they are the weaker sex, that they cannot do anything that man can do. They can do small homely things -- that is their world. I want to destroy that idea completely. And you can see I have destroyed it.\nMy communes are run by women, and they have proved far superior to men in every possible way. My sannyasins are doing better business than any man can do, finding better bargains than any man can find. I wanted it to be a solid\nargument before the whole of humanity that women are not inferior, that if you give them a chance, they can even prove superior in many matters. At least they are going to prove equal.\nAnd this is a strange way: to keep half of humanity in a downtrodden state. How much is the loss? -- half of humanity means that women, if they were accepted equally, would have produced a Dostoevsky, a Turgenev, a Chekhov, a Gorky, a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Nijinsky. They may have proved a Buddha, a Jesus. Half\nof humanity! -- it is a vast ocean to whom you have denied all possibilities of creation, expression. And you have behaved with women as if they are cattle, not human beings.\nIt is not going to be so in my commune.\nBut I do not agree with the liberation movement of women, because that is going in a reactionary way, creating hate for men -- so much so that their basic approach is now that no woman should love any man, that they should all be lesbians.\nHere, women are running the whole commune, everything, but no man who is here has ever felt that he is inferior. In fact, for the first time he feels a respect for women. He can see the dignity of women. Every day I receive letters from my male sannyasins asking, \"What is happening? The commune sannyasins, the women, are becoming juicier and juicier, more and more graceful, more and more beautiful. And they are working so hard!\"\nFor the first time, they have been given the chance to show their mettle. It is not a loss to men: they have found a companion, equal to themselves, side by side with them.\nYou were missing half of humanity.… And remember, because you have repressed that half, that half was trying to take revenge in every possible way. Of course, the woman has her own ways of taking revenge, and every man knows how the woman can take revenge. Every woman has been taking it for centuries. She will be nagging the husband, she will be spying on the husband. She will make the husband just a henpecked person.\nAll husbands are henpecked! I have never come across another category. Outside they may roar like lions, but that is not to be believed. Just look through the keyhole in their houses -- the woman is roaring and the husband is hiding like a rat behind this chair, behind that table. It is natural, because if you repress their energy, somehow they are going to revolt against it. Here, men also are feeling tremendously relieved because no woman is nagging them.\nWomen's liberation is automatically men's liberation. Women's slavery is automatically men's slavery. They go together.\nBut this is only a transitory period.… Once I have proved my point, all around the world in different countries and different communes -- even where I am not present -- women will be on the top, once the point is proved and people can see. Just four years ago, when we came here, we did not have a single dollar. My women sannyasins managed to purchase 126 square miles, an area three times\nbigger than New York. In four years we have poured almost two hundred million dollars into creating this oasis, and all has been managed by women. They have proved their mettle -- and without insulting men, without putting them down, without in any way taking revenge. And they are not lesbians.\nSo it is, in fact, a tremendous revolution which is needed, which has been needed for centuries. And the sooner the whole world goes the way my communes function, the better, because I don't think women will be ready to use nuclear weapons in the third world war. Women won't want to kill; that is not part of their feminine psychology. They would like people to come closer, to be more loving.\nIf the world is run by women -- and man can take his place more significantly in scientific research, in the service of life and creativity -- and the governments and all other functional things are run by women, we will have a tremendous balance.\nIt will take a little time for women to produce Einstein and Picasso and Michelangelo. It will take a little time to bring a Mozart, a Leonardo da Vinci, because for thousands of years -- in fact, for the whole history -- they have been repressed, so it will need a little time. And once the repression changes into expression, it will be just like land which has been lying fallow for thousands of years gathering all kinds of fertilizers, rain water, and nobody cultivating it. When you cultivate it, it is going to give you a bumper crop. All other fields will look poor because they have been exploited every year; they have lost their energy to produce more.\nThe same is the situation of the human mind. The feminine mind has not been used, has not been allowed to function. If it is allowed, it may take a quantum leap. And it will be a blessing for all.\nAn intelligent woman, respected as equal to men in the society, will not become a lesbian because it is unnatural, absolutely unnatural. She will be heterosexual. And if all women turn to heterosexuality, we will be declaring war on homosexuality, too, because from where are they going to find men? They will chase the homosexuals to their deaths. They are chasing them here. We have got a few homosexuals, and they go on writing letters of complaint to me: \"We are homosexuals and women are chasing us. We are not interested, but we do not want even to declare that we are homosexual.\" I say, \"What can I do? Drop your homosexuality.\"\nWe can make a better world together. Men and women should be really half- and-half of a whole. There are qualities which men have and women do not have; there are qualities which women have and men do not have. Both together, the human being will be richer in every possible way.\nJust think of a woman pilot dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I cannot conceive of it. If there had been a woman pilot, she would have refused to follow the order. She would have preferred to be shot dead, but she would not go to kill innocent people who have nothing to do with war.\nAnd anyway, the war was ending. Germany was already on its knees, it was only a question of a week or two until Japan would surrender. There was no need of an atom bomb to create a hell for two beautiful cities.\nI don't think a woman could have done that. A woman would rather have said, \"You can court-martial me. You can shoot me. That seems to be easier than killing 100,000 people in one city, and 120,000 people in another city.\"\nBut what did the man pilot do? He dropped atom bombs on both the cities, came back to his base, had a good dinner, smoked the best cigar, joked with his friends, and went to sleep with a woman. In the morning when the journalists reached him, they asked the man if it had been very difficult for him to sleep having caused 220,000 people's deaths.\nHe said, \"No, I slept beautifully. I did my duty, and once the duty was fulfilled -- and it was a great duty to be fulfilled -- I was feeling so happy that I managed to do it that I went to sleep with a woman and had a beautiful sleep.\"\nBecause it had been his orders, President Truman was asked early in the morning the next day, \"How was your night?\" He said, \"I felt immensely relieved. Now there is no question of the war being prolonged any more. Not only that, we have made a point to the whole world: Don't come in conflict with America, otherwise the result will be more Hiroshimas, more Nagasakis\" -- not a single word of sympathy for those innocent people. They were civilians, they were not in military camps.\nI have seen a picture that I cannot forget. One friend from Japan sent me a photograph of a small child, maybe eight or nine years old. His bag hanging on his shoulder, his books in the bag, he was going upstairs into the attic which was allotted to him as his place to study and sleep. And just when he was on the middle of the staircase, the atom bomb fell on Hiroshima. The boy simply got burned and got stuck into the wall -- just a burned body with a burned bag, burned books.\nWhen I saw that picture, I could not believe that man can do this to man. If a woman was president of America, I don't think this could have happened. Man has been given enough chance; now let the woman come up, and man can pour his energies more into scientific fields. Meanwhile, women will pick things up.\nYes, there is a certain basic strategy why my communes are run by women. But you can meet my male sannyasins. They are not in any way thought to be inferior. No woman is treating them as inferior in the way they have always treated women as inferior.\nPerhaps it is that the male ego functions in that way: unless it makes somebody feel inferior, it is not satisfied. The woman functions in a different way: unless she feels somebody needing her, desiring her, she feels frustrated. A man's need seems to be to dominate, and the woman's need seems to be to be needed. That is a far better need -- to be needed.\nAnd I am doing an experiment, I am not a philosopher. I hate philosophy because it is simply a wastage of time. My commune is my experiment, and\neverything that I have envisioned has come true in it. The same can happen all over the world. This is a prototype.\nQ: YOU HAVE ALSO SAID, \"WE ARE NOT MISSIONARIES.\" WHY? DON'T YOU WANT MORE SANNYASINS?\nA: We are not missionaries because we don't want anybody to be converted into sannyasins by us. We are available for anybody who wants to join us. He is welcome. We are receptive to anybody without conditions, but we are not going after people like the Christian missionaries or the Witnesses of Jehovah, forcing their Bible on you, knocking on your doors every morning. We are not going to knock on anybody's door.\nYes, we will spread the message -- that's why I am talking with you. We will spread the message and if anybody wants to come with us and join our caravan, we are perfectly happy.\nBut this is a very different approach from missionaries. It is not aggressive, it is receptive; it is not masculine, it is feminine. That is the difference I make between these two psychologies. The male psychology is to go after the woman -- that is the missionary. The woman's psychology is to escape from the missionary, but remain receptive. She never escapes too much. She always remains within the boundary so you can catch hold of her, but she lures by running away. By running away she becomes more beautiful; by running away she becomes a dream girl a very homely girl can become a dream girl.\nI trust in the feminine psychology because these missionary types of people around the world are aggressive. They are in a kind of war; very subtle, but it is a war. They are in politics -- very subtle, but it is a politics of numbers. What has the pope got that he should be respected? I have seen his statements, which are not even his statements, his secretary goes on writing them. Even then, all those statements prove only a thick head. Nothing of importance ever comes out of these popes.\nAnd the missionaries I have been in touch with in India were of a very high caliber -- men like Stanley Jones -- but the whole effort is how to convert people into Christianity. What did Stanley Jones do? He created a Christian ashram. To exploit Hindus, he used the word ashram. He managed his ashram just the way Hindus live in their ashrams: getting up early in the morning, going to the Ganges for the bath, then going to the church to pray. Every ritual of the Hindus was copied.\nThe only difference was that Krishna was missing, and there was Christ. And that is not much of a difference because there are scholars who say that Christ never existed, it is just another name for Krishna. I was looking at how Krishna can become Christ in Indian languages, and then I came across Bengali: in Bengali, Krishna is called Christo. Now that comes very close to Christ.\nThere are scholars who think there has never been any Christ, it was just that the story of Krishna, changing through many forms, finally took this Aramaic transformation; and Christianity was born out.of a borrowed myth.\nI asked Stanley Jones, \"Can't you see your diplomacy? Whom do you want to deceive?\" He used to wear Hindu clothes. In his ashram, everybody used to wear Hindu clothes. Nobody could smoke there. No alcohol was allowed. But the whole point was somehow to attract Hindus there, and then convert them.\nThis is aggression, violence. It is interfering into your inner being. It is far worse than cutting off your head. At least I cut off your head without changing you. I respect you as you are and cut off your head. They don't cut your head, but they destroy your mind, they reprogram you. They replace Krishna with Christ, they put a cross in place of a flute -- which is an ugly replacement.\nThe flute is life-affirming and the cross is death-oriented. No Jonestown could have ever happened under Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism. It is impossible. A Jonestown needed absolutely a Christian context. It needed a cross.\nAnd Reverend Jim Jones was doing exactly the same foolishness that Jesus did. He was simply following step by step. Jesus had told his people that they would be coming with him into the kingdom of God. Of course, he would be going first to make arrangements for them. And for two thousand years he has been making arrangements -- and the idiots are still waiting.\nJim Jones was more contemporary. He thought it better to take the whole lot, the whole congregation with him. Why should he go first and prepare the ground? -- and then Jesus has not been heard from for two thousand years. Perhaps people are not allowed to come back here; it seems to be better to take everybody with.… This could happen only in a Christian context.\nIf women are leaders in politics, leaders in science, leaders in poetry, painting, they will bring a totally new perspective to everything. Women should be professors, educationists, they should be everywhere. They are half of the world\n-- they own half the world. And my experience here is that they are tremendously capable, reliable. You can trust them more because they connect with you not from the head, but from the heart.\nQ: YOU SAY YOU CAN'T COEXIST WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. DO YOU WANT A RED OREGON, A RED WORLD? AND ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE?\nA: We never plan anything, but we are always ready to fight for human rights. Whatever the consequence, we will fight for democracy. We will fight for freedom. We will fight for respect towards the individual. We will fight for America and will not allow Americans to destroy its beauty, its Constitution, its Declaration of Independence. We are on the side of America, and the Oregonians are not. That is my basic standpoint.\nWe have not committed a single crime, we have not done anything illegal. We have not done anything against the Constitution, and the State of Oregon has done everything against the Constitution, against the law. They have used the law in a way it has never been used against anybody. They have taken advantage of the loopholes in the law.\nBut my commune is not Reverend Jim Jones' uneducated black people. My commune has four hundred law experts. There is no other firm in the whole world which has four hundred law experts.\nWe are going to fight to the very end. And remember, we are fighting for the values America stands for, and they are fighting against their own values, their own Constitution, their own law.\nThey are fascists, and I don't think fascism can win. We are a small minority, but we are not threatened by them; they are a big majority, and they are threatened by us. You can see clearly what is the reason.\nThe reason is that we are standing for their Constitution, and they are going against their own Constitution. In the courts they are getting defeated everywhere. In the lower courts perhaps they may succeed, because they belong to the state, they are under the pressure of the state; but as we move higher, our number of wins gets bigger.\nThe moment we are in the federal courts, we immediately win. And I am absolutely certain I myself am going to stand in the Supreme Court of America to save the Constitution of America against all those who want to prostitute it.\nIs it a Constitution or a prostitution?\nWe are not threatened, we are really enjoying the whole game. Anything more?\nQ: THE LAST QUESTION! ONCE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A HOLOCAUST BETWEEN 1984 AND 1999. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\nA: It means nothing. Eat more spaghetti! There will be no holocaust.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #20 Chapter title: none 6 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH PENNY ALLEN, FREELANCE JOURNALIST, SISTERS, OREGON\nQUESTION:* I HAVE READ THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE ENLIGHTENMENT AVAILABLE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. NOW I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NOT ALL ITS CRACKED UP TO BE, AND THAT YOU WANT TO BE NORMAL. WHAT'S HAPPENING?\nANSWER: Enlightenment is only the beginning; there is infinity to go for. Enlightenment is only a door, and then there is an unending existence, an unending evolution, expansion.\nThe people who are unconscious, for them enlightenment is the goal; they are not aware of the fact that enlightenment is only a door. Once you have reached it, then a new kind of pilgrimage starts. Up to this door, you were an entity. Beyond this door, you will not be an entity. You will be just pure consciousness without a body, without a mind; you will be just a fragrance which will go on spreading all over existence.\nAnd the fragrance is luminous. It is full of awareness. It knows itself and it knows the whole existence around it -- not as separate, but part, a kind of at-one- ment. It is the universe, and the universe is it; there is no division, no duality.\nNow the observer becomes the observed; the seer becomes the seen. He is both. It is difficult to explain to people who have not even thought about the door, whose lives go on like sleepwalkers, somnambulists. They live, but at the very minimum level without any intensity, without any totality.\nAnd this calamity has happened because of a few vested interests. The priest, the politician, all those who have been in power. They never wanted man to be awake, because if humanity consists of awakened individuals, there is not going to be any Christianity. There is not going to be any Hinduism. there is not going to be any American, and Russian, any German. There is not going to be the white man and the black man; there is not going to be man the superior and woman the inferior. All these stupidities will disappear.\nFor the awakened man, the whole existence is one. Not only this earth, but now he is joined with the stars, too. And in his vision the smallest blade of grass is as significant and important to existence as the biggest star millions of light years away.\nThe priest does not want people to be awake because they can be exploited only when they are asleep. The politician does not want people to be awake; otherwise, they will not be democrats, republicans, socialists and communists. They will be individuals intelligent and conscious enough to decide for themselves. They will not need parties and religions and cults and all their struggles and squabbles.\nThe vested interests have kept man almost drugged. I don't agree with Karl Marx on any other point, but on one point I absolutely agree with him -- religion is the opium of the people. On that point also I have my reservations.\nFirst, he was only aware of Western religions: Judaism -- he was a Jew; Christianity -- which is an offshoot of Judaism; and a little bit of Islam -- that, too, is an offshoot of Judaism. He had no knowledge about the Eastern religions: Buddhism, Jainism, Tao, Zen. They were unknown dimensions to him.\nSecondly, he was not aware he could not be aware, of me and my people -- we were not yet there -- and a totally new quality of religion which I call religiousness. Not religion, but religiousness; no God, but godliness. I change every noun, every pronoun into a verb because existence is a verb, it is not a noun. It is continuously growing, flowing, expanding.\nNow physicists say that the stars you see in the night are continuously running farther away from the center. We don't know where the center is; we don't know where they are going, and the speed is immense -- 186,000 miles per second. With that speed, although the stars are going farther and farther away, this continuous growth needs not static things but growing things.\nThat's why you will find so many contradictions in me. I have never stopped anywhere. I have been going in absolute tune with existence, wherever it leads. And if it contradicts my yesterdays, it is perfectly okay. They are dead anyway.\nI am happy that I am in tune in the present moment. I am happy that I know the secret of being in the present, because time has no other tense. It is always now. And once you know the secret of being in the now, you have known the greatest mystery of existence.\nBut the people who are in power would like human beings to remain involved and occupied with very stupid things -- communism, socialism, this party, that party, Christianity, Hinduism. The people are burdened with their own problems. They, too, are mostly created.\nFor example, marriage is a problem created by the priests. It is unnatural, it has not happened naturally. Now the man is being nagged by the wife; the wife is being continuously put down by the man. Then there are children. And the Pope and Mother Teresa go on telling people that these children are sent by God, so don't use any birth control methods -- that's sin.\nSo people have dozens of children, thousands of worries. How to bring them up? How to educate them? We have made a world for human beings so difficult, and on top of it there is hell. If you just slip a little bit, you fall into eternal hell. For small things. And there is paradise luring you with all those things every religion condemns here on earth. And the saints are enjoying all those things there.\nI have heard a story of a Zen Master. He was always teaching his disciples that celibacy is categorical. Without it, you cannot enter into nirvana, the kingdom of God. The poor disciples were trying hard to be celibate. It is really doing something unnatural, almost impossible. They were all feeling guilty. And then the Master died. His last words were, \"Remember celibacy is the foundation of religion.\"\nAfter a few days, one of the disciples died, and the moment he entered paradise he was so full of joy that now he would be meeting his Master. He had been with the Master for thirty, forty years.\nHe saw the Master sitting by the bank of a beautiful river under the shadow of a very huge and ancient tree, with a beautiful naked woman sitting in his lap. The disciple could not believe his eyes. Still just out of old habit, he fell in the Master's feet and asked, \"What is happening? What happened to celibacy?\" The Master said, \"You will always remain an idiot! This is the reward for all my celibacy. Now I can enjoy as many women as I want, and here no woman grows old, no woman perspires, no woman has menstrual periods. You cannot improve upon the women that are available here. Their very body is fragrant; they don't use French perfumes.\" But the poor disciple was at a loss. It was such a shock.\nThis is the situation of all the religions. All the things that they deny to people here, they will give a million times more as a reward in paradise. Naturally, the poor human being is pulled. To be, or not to be? To enjoy a woman here or to wait just a few years more and enjoy as many women as you want for eternity. No marriage happens in heaven; all marriages happen in the churches. And they say that marriage is made in heaven, but in heaven there are no couples, only individuals.\nThe poor man is pulled apart. His fear of hell represses him; his greed for heaven represses him. With so many problems of day to day living he has no time to think of enlightenment. He has no time to think that there is anything more than this miserable world.\nAnd this is a created situation, because only in such a situation can you keep them enslaved. You can send them to Vietnam to kill innocent people without any hate. You can send your pilots to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki within seconds without any feeling. You have turned people into robots. Millions of people around the earth are in the armies, just functioning like robots. And those who are not in the armies are also imprisoned in some kind of social, political, religious ideology. It is so difficult to find an individual who is clean, completely clean.\nAnd that's my whole effort: to create a complete clean human being, unburdened of the past, unburdened of any guilt. unburdened of fear and greed, unburdened of politicians and priests. Just clean, so clean that he becomes a mirror. And in that mirror, you see for the first time where the door is. In that mirror, the door reflects.\nJust as our eyes are mirrors in which things reflect -- we find where the table is and where the chair is because our two eyes are mirroring things around us -- when a man is completely clean, silent, serene, his inner being becomes a mirror and the inward door that was always there is reflected in it. And the magnetism of the door is such that once one has seen it, there is no way to escape from it.\nYou start moving toward that door the way a moth moves toward a flame knowing perfectly that coming closer to the flame he is going to be burned, he is going to die. But some strange attraction, the moth is ready to die.\nThe same is the situation when you see the door of enlightenment for the first time. You become the moth and the door becomes the flame. You know you are going to die; but at the same time you know that you are going to be reborn on the other side.\nThis is resurrection.\nQ:* IF I COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR PAST. WHEN YOU\nWERE LOOKING FOR THAT DOOR, YOU SPENT A YEAR WHEN YOU WERE MAD -- IN WHICH YOU COULDN'T FORMULATE A SENTENCE -- AND YOU LOST YOUR PERSPECTIVE. IS THIS CORRECT? IS THAT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT DOOR?\nA:* I have been looking for that door as long as I remember, from my very childhood. I must have carried that idea from my past life because I don't remember a single day in my childhood in this life that I was not looking for it.\nAnd as far as my craziness is concerned, naturally I was thought crazy by everybody. I never played with any children. I never could find any way to communicate with the children of my own age. To me, they looked stupid, doing all kinds of idiotic things. I never joined any football team, volleyball team, hockey team; of course, they all thought me crazy. And as far as I was concerned, as I grew I started looking at the whole world as crazy.\nIn the last year -- when I was twenty-one -- it was a time of nervous breakdown and breakthrough. Naturally, those who loved me, my family, my friends, my professors, could understand a little bit what was going on in me -- why I was so different from other children, why I would go on sitting for hours with closed eyes, why I sat by the bank of the river and went on looking at the sky for hours, sometimes for the whole night. Naturally the people who could not understand such things -- and I did not expect them to understand -- thought me mad.\nIn my own home, I had become almost absent. I would be there in the room and my mother would be asking me, \"If you see someone in the house, just tell me,\nbecause I don't see anybody here and I have to send somebody to fetch some fruits or some vegetable from the market.\" The market was not far away, just two minutes walk; but I was not considered to be anybody. They had accepted the fact that I was good for nothing.\nAnd they were right. In the morning they would send me to purchase something which was needed immediately and I would return in the night. And then I would say, \"I think you had sent me for something, but I completely forgot about it. If you remind me, I can run again.\" And they said, \"Please, excuse us that we sent you. Now if you go again, then the whole night nobody knows when you will turn up.\"\nBy and by they stopped asking me anything, and slowly, slowly they started feeling as if I were not there. And I loved it, the way I had become a nothingness, a nobody, an absence.\nThat one year was tremendous. I was surrounded with nothingness, emptiness. I had lost all contact with the world. If they reminded me to take a bath, I would go on taking the bath for hours. Then they had to knock on the door, \"Now come out of the bathroom. You have taken enough bath for one month. Just come out.\" If they reminded me to eat, I ate; otherwise, days would pass and I would not eat. Not that I was fasting, I had no idea about eating or fasting. My whole concern was to go deeper and deeper into myself, and the door was so magnetic, the pull was so immense -- like what physicists now call black holes.\nThey say there are black holes in existence. If a star comes by chance to a black hole, it is pulled into the black hole. There is no way to resist that pull, and to go into the black hole is to go into destruction. We don't know what happens on the other side. My idea, for which some physicist has to find evidence, is that the black hole on this side is a white hole on the other side. The hole cannot be just one side; it is a tunnel.\nI have experienced it in myself. Perhaps on a bigger scale the same happens in the universe. The star dies; as far as we can see, it disappears. But every moment new stars are being born. From where? Where is their womb?\nIt is simple arithmetic that the black hole was just a womb -- the old disappeared into it, and the new is born. This I have experienced in myself -- I am not a physicist. That one year of tremendous pull made me farther and farther away from people; so much so, that I would not recognize my own mother. I might not recognize my own father. So far that there were times I forgot my own name. I tried hard, but there was no way to find what my name used to be.\nNaturally, for everybody that one year I was mad; but, to me, that madness became meditation and the ultimate of that madness opened the door.\nI passed through it. I am now beyond enlightenment -- on the other side of the door.\nQ:* EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, DO YOU STILL HAVE BLACK MOMENTS? FOR\nEXAMPLE, THIS SPRING WHEN YOU STOPPED GIVING DISCOURSES FOR TWO MONTHS, WHERE WERE YOU? WERE YOU IN THE BLACK HOLE?\nA:* No. I have passed the black hole. Now I am always in the white house. Presidents will come and go, but I am going to remain in the white house all the time.\nQ:* IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU WERE SILENT FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AROUND APRIL AND MAY OF THIS YEAR?\nA:* Yes. I was sick at that time. I was not feeling fell, so I simply rested. But I was not in silence.\nQ:* IT WASN'T A LOSS OF PERSPECTIVE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?\nA:* No, nothing. That cannot happen now. That is an impossibility.\nQ:* YOU HAVE SAID THAT HERE ON THE RANCH, IN THE BUDDHAFIELD, YOUR SANNYASINS EXPERIENCE AND SHARE MOODS; THAT JOY IS CONTAGIOUS. DOES A BAD MOOD EVER PASS THROUGH THE COMMUNE?\nA:* Just wait a minute. First let me finish your last question; otherwise you will be in a difficulty to figure it out.\nFor three and a half years I was silent to sort out those people who were hanging around my words, who were enchanted by my words, who loved my voice, who loved the way I speak, I argue. But that is not my basic function. I speak to help you to be silent. I say something so that you can go beyond words.\nI use words to help you to go into wordlessness. It is just like having a thorn in the foot, with another thorn you pull it out. Your mind is full of birds, so many and so much chattering, yakketty-yak, yakketty-yak. It goes on and on.\nBut then, people became intoxicated with my words. That was not my purpose. I continuously insisted, \"Don't be concerned with my words; be concerned with my silences, the gaps between the words, the gaps between the lines.\"\nThree years I remained silent. Those few remained hanging around for a few months. Some managed to hang around for one or two years. Three years was too much; by and by they all left me thinking that I was going to remain silent forever. The day I saw that all those people who were interested in my words but not in silence had left, it was time to speak.\nAnd this speaking is totally different from the speaking that was there three and a half years ago. I was speaking to people who were listening through the head. I was arguing, I was rationalizing, I was doing everything to convince their heads. Now there is no need of that. I have got people with whom I can talk heart to\nheart. My words don't pass their heads. There is no scrutiny in their heads when they hear my words. My words simply penetrate directly into their hearts.\nAlbert Einstein has proved according to non-Euclidean geometry that there are no straight lines in existence. He is right as far as objective lines are concerned. Every line is a curve -- of a very big circle, so you cannot see it as a curve -- if you go on drawing the line on both ends, one day you will find that you have made a circle.\nIn existence there are no straight lines. If we draw a straight line here on the floor, it looks absolutely straight, but it cannot be because the earth is round. This small straight line is just a piece of a vast round which goes around the earth.\nEinstein is dead; otherwise I would have said to him that I know there are lines which go straight, too. But those lines are not of geometry, they are lines of love. I experience it every day. My being and my sannyasins' beings are joined not by curved lines but by straight lines. Now it is a totally different affair. I can say whatsoever I want to say. Three and a half years ago I had to say things which people wanted to hear. I had to drop a few things because they would not be able to digest them. I had to impose interpretations on Jesus on Krishna, on Buddha for the simple reason that if I impose that interpretation on Jesus, I can have a certain communication with the Christian. We can come close.\nNow I have my own people so I don't take the trouble to interpret Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Lao Tzu. On the contrary, all the things that I left unsaid before my silence began I am saying now. And the interpretations that I had managed through Jesus's mouth I am taking back and putting Jesus in his own place.\nSo my work has really started now. Before the silent period, I was just preparing the ground and finding the people who will be able to remain with me in every climate, in every season, in every change. I am not a thinker who remains consistent. Because I am an existential man who moves with existence, only those who don't bother about what I said yesterday can move with me. If today I am contradicting it, they don't worry about it.\nOne thing is to be understood very clearly: to my sannyasins whatever I am saying is not important; what is important is that I am saying it. Whatever is being said has no significance; but in saying it on my part and hearing it on their part, something else side by side with the words has transferred.\nThose words were just vehicles creating a way for something which cannot be said, cannot be reduced to language at all. that's why they are never concerned about contradictions. I am not creating a philosophy or a theology. It is a religious field of experience.\nNow, you were asking something. You can ask.\nQ:* I ASKED ABOUT THE ENERGY FIELD HERE; AND I WAS WONDERING IF IT EVER HAPPENED, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE NOT FEELING\nWELL, THAT A MELANCHOLY CAUGHT ON? OR, IS THE ENERGY HERE ALWAYS POSITIVE?\nA:* It is always positive. My sickness is a physical thing; the energy has nothing to do with my body. The energy is never sick. It is never negative.\nI mean the energy of an enlightened person is never negative. the energy of an unenlightened person is always negative. The unenlightened knows nothing of positive energy. He only reads books on positive thinking and this and that. Idiots like Norman Vincent Peale go on writing books on positive thinking, and millions of people read those books thinking that perhaps by positive thinking they can become millionaires, by positive thinking they can produce palaces. And they don't bother about how many palaces Norman Vincent Peale has created. They don't bother at all that Rockefeller has never read Peale, that Henry Ford has no idea of Peale.\nIt is not a question of positive thinking. Positive thinking is appealing only to negative people, because they know their negativity continuously. But without enlightenment, you cannot have positive energy. So I saw throw away all those books on positive thinking. They are deluding you. They are giving you a sense as if without being enlightened you can be positive. That is impossible.\nPositivity is beyond the door of enlightenment. Negativity is on this side. The night is on this side -- the black hole -- and the day is on the other side where the sun never sets.\nSo as far as I am concerned, I am always overflowing with energy. My body can be sick -- but that makes no difference to my innermost being; it remains exactly the same. and whether I am speaking or silent, my field is vibrating, is ready to welcome anybody who comes with an open heart, is ready to receive into the innermost center of the energy field one who is not resistant, not reluctant, but is ready, vulnerable, open, is willing to risk.\nThere is a field already existing. And the moment you enter Rajneeshpuram, you will feel a different air, a different milieu, a different silence, a different loving energy all over the place. But those who come with closed eyes and closed heart, those who come with prejudices already determined with their conclusions -- naturally, they come, they go, and they remain untouched by the immense energy that was available, free.\nI have been known around the world as the free sex guru. Now they should change it because things have gone far beyond sex. Sex is energy, the energy of the sleepy man. The moment a man becomes enlightened, the same energy turns into a positive field. Now they should start calling me the free energy guru, because I have traveled miles, and the go on calling me something which I have left far behind.\nEven if I die and my people can remain rejoicing, loving, the energy field will remain. I cannot take it away with me. But if they start being ordinary again, jealous, full of hate, hostility, violence, then they will destroy the energy field.\nI have created the energy field; now it is existing almost independent of me. And my whole effort is that while I am alive I should detach myself completely from the energy field and see whether my people can manage it.\nAnd that's what I am doing every day. I am giving more and more responsibility to my people. I am sending people from one commune to another. If twenty people are ready here, I send them to Germany. If in Japan they need, I send people there. So twenty people go to Germany and from that commune twenty people come here. So in both ways it is a great exchange program. My twenty people there will try to create the energy field, and those twenty people here will learn how energy fields are created and how one should preserve them.\nSoon I want a belt of energy around the earth. And as far as I am concerned that energy belt is the only hope for life to exist beyond this century. Otherwise the politicians have already arranged for global death.\nQ:* HOW CAN THE ENERGY FIELD, THE GESTALT, OF THIS PLACE CONTINUE WITH NO CHILDREN BEING BORN? I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR VIEWS ON THAT SUBJECT AND I AGREE WITH THEM. I JUST WONDER HOW WILL YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? HOW CAN IT CONTINUE AND EVERYONE JUST GETS OLDER AND THERE ARE NO YOUNG PEOPLE COMING UP?\nA:* They will be coming. I am telling my people not to produce children. Enough young people are all around the world. why bother creating children and waste your energy in growing them up? I need all that energy for my energy field. So right now I cannot spend any amount of energy in giving birth to children and rearing them.\nAnd what is the use when all over the world there are millions of young people frustrated with the whole society, searching for a new way of life? It is so easy. When you can get ready-made young people, it is simply uneconomical to produce children. And we are going to get hold of the whole youth because there is no competitor around.\nThe young man has fallen away from the old generation and the old people are trying hard to bridge the gap. Their priests are learning psychology, doing research work, getting Ph.D.s in psychology, in psychiatry and philosophy to figure out somehow what has happened, why this generation gap goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger.\nBut they are not going to be able to bridge it for the simple reason that they are still trying to bridge it so that they can keep the young people in the old fold. The young people need a milieu of freedom, love, responsibility, joy. They are not concerned with your God, whether he exists or not. They are not interested in your heaven and hell.\nThe whole old mind is so out of date that just by changing words and paraphrasing old things into new language, they are not going to manage to\nfulfill the needs of the young people. In fact they are the cause of creating this whole frustration, anxiety, anguish in young people all around the world.\nI am the alternative. I will tell my people to produce children only when we cannot get any from the ready-made market. And I don't think that is going to happen. The ready-made market is so big, and people are continuously bringing new children into the world, not knowing that they are bringing people for me. They would stop if they knew that Pope the Polack and Mother Teresa-type people are all working for me by preventing people from using birth control methods, the pill, by teaching people that abortion is a sin. They don't know -- unknowingly, they are my agents. They are working; and, for centuries, you need not worry, new people will be coming in.\nAnd when we have enough energy field that the whole earth is surrounded by a certain belt of energy, then I can tell to my people: it is time. You produce. Certainly your children will be far better. They will come out of your meditativeness, out of your love. They will not be accidental. But not now. The way I have got all these people from ready-made shops -- I am going to continue my business the same way.\nQ:* I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE COMMUNITY IN OREGON THINKS ABOUT YOU; THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT YOU, YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. BUT I WANTED TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT THE POLARIZATION THAT HAS GONE ON FOR FOUR YEARS OR SO IN OREGON. I FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POLARIZATION WAS A KIND OF PUBLIC DYNAMIC MEDITATION THAT YOU WERE CARRYING ON TO TRY AND INCREASE TENSION FOR A LONG TIME SO THAT AFTER A WHILE IT WOULD RELAX. YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, \"YES.\"\nA:* I will go on finding new ways to create more and more madness in the Oregonians because that is one of my ways of working. That's what I have been doing in India, and I am going to do it in America. Wherever I am, my way of finding friends is to create enemies. Then a clear-cut polarization happens. If there are no enemies outside, your friends become lousy, lazy, dull, dead. A certain hostility around is absolutely necessary for you to be alert, to be stronger, to be together. This happens naturally. I can create any kind of opposition. If one dies, another; there is no trouble in it. And since we are not troubled and we are always the beneficiaries of it, why should we stop it?\nThat's why I refused point blank the question of a journalist who asked if there were any possibility of coexistence. I said, \"Never. Either we or they.\" It is a question of either/or. It is not politics in which nations coexist. Jews and Christians coexist with all their hostility repressed. They are not friends.\nNow the Pope is trying to make some arrangements with the Jews, trying to forget all those two thousand years of hostility. But neither can Christians forget\nthat Jesus was crucified, nor can Jews forget what has been done to them continuously for two thousand years. This is a political way: You keep your hostility repressed and I keep my hostility repressed, because somehow we are here; we have to be here, so we coexist.\nI don't like that word at all. I have my own word. I call it parallel existence: We will exist the way we want to exist; you exist the way you want to exist. There is no question of coexistence, it is parallel existence -- two lines running parallel, meeting never.\nThe only way is that you convince us that you are more joyful, more dancing, more blissful. I am not concerned about theories -- that you convince us about God; I am concerned about people. You have to prove that you are more joyful than we are, you are more blissful than we are, you are more peaceful than we are. Then certainly we will mix with you. What is the need to remain separate?\nOr, sooner or later you have to recognize -- ion fact, even in their hostility people have recognized it reluctantly -- that these people are certainly happy, far happier than they have ever been.\nTheir theology has not helped. It has helped them to become more miserable. Their Jesus Christ has not come to save them. Their politics and their politicians have failed them. Their leaders are just professional liars.\nThey have to see that there is a small oasis amongst them where no politics exists, no competition exists, no jealousy exists; where the people are working so hard for twelve and fourteen hours a day, seven days a week with no holiday. Since I don't believe in God, I don't believe that on Sunday he stopped working, so I cannot give any holiday. People are working fourteen hours a day and looking so happy and so radiant and so joyful and so dancing -- how long can they ignore that fact?\nIt is something existential, not theoretical. It is not like Protestant Martin Luther arguing with the Catholic Pope. It is not Hindus arguing against Buddhists. It is a totally different kind of argument. We are not saying anything -- we are showing them something; and sooner or later they will have to see it. They will have to hear our laughter, they will have to see this desert becoming again green, bringing flowers. For fifty years it has been a dead land. They will see birds coming again, animals coming.\nI don't think that they are more stupid than the animals. You go in the night in the commune and you will find deer standing on the road not caring at all about you. They know my sannyasins -- nobody is going to hurt them. People have to get out of their cars to push them away.\nIn my own garden I have one hundred peacocks. They don't allow even me in the house. They are blocking my way all over the place; not only blocking, if they are somewhere else, they rush toward the car just to stand in front. I enjoy. That means they have understood that nobody is going to harm them, and they love the play. I will move the car slowly, they will go on moving backwards slowly, but they will not go out of the way.\nI don't think Oregonians are more stupid than the peacocks and the deer and the swans that we have. Nobody is worried here, not even animals.\nWhen I came to this place the junipers were small, dying, almost dead. Now they are lush green, have become thicker, bigger. Just four years more and you will see all these hills green and all this valley full of laughter.\nOregonians cannot resist the temptation to come here, to see the people, to understand the people. That's why I don't believe in coexistence. My denial was not understood by the journalist who had asked, because the moment I said, \"Never,\" she immediately left the mike. She should have asked what were my implications, what did I mean by never, why was I saying never.\nPerhaps she had come to hear that word, and once she got it, her prejudice was fulfilled and she immediately left. If she had asked my implications, she would have understood -- we coexist only with enemies.\nI would like to be one with the Oregonians, not coexist -- that word is ugly, but that woman was so prejudiced she could not stay a single moment. She did not give me a chance to explain what I meant. That's what I was going to do, but as I looked, she was gone. So I said it is better to let her go; that will create more hostility and it will do something good.\nIn my life everything has been doing good to me. I have never come across any situation which finally has not been a blessing. So I have learned to trust life and its ways.\nQ:* THERE'S SO MUCH MUSIC THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS PLACE, A MUSIC OF AN ORIGINAL SORT. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL EVER BE A LITERATURE COMING OUT OF HERE?\nA:* Soon everything will be coming out from here. And everything that will come out from here will have a different flavor to it. We have sculptors here, for example, but right now they are making houses, roads, and other things which are of more basic necessity. Once we are finished with the infrastructure of the commune, all our sculptors will be free, all our painters will be free, all our poets will be free, and you will see something of a totally new quality coming in every direction, every dimension.\nI have here around me the most intelligent group you can find -- the most talented people who can do anything -- you just have to give them time, the opportunity, and they are ready to do anything.\nDo you see my watch? Piaget was asking half a million dollars for it. One of my sannyasins I sent to Switzerland to learn how to make watches. Within two weeks he was back and since then he has made four or five watches and he has been teaching other sannyasins. The other sannyasin has made this watch. It is far better than the Piaget, far more accurate, and it is made of real stones -- not of diamonds. It is not fake: real, authentic stones.\nOne of the idiots from Portland said on television that I was wearing a fake watch. He does not understand language -- these stones are not fake. These stones are as real as any diamonds. If he cannot make the distinction between diamonds and stones, that simply means he should accept his ignorance about jewelry.\nBut he cannot make my watch fake! It has been made with so much love, that to me, these stones are far more precious than any diamonds can be. I will not sell this watch for ten million dollars; no price will be accepted for the watch. It cannot be sold: love cannot be sold and purchased.\nHearing the man calling the watch fake, I could see how people are blind. If I was saying that these are diamonds and later on you find they are not, then certainly it is a fake watch. But I am saying these are stones. And if you cannot understand any difference between stones and diamonds, it shows your state of knowledge or ignorance. To me it makes no difference. These stones are so beautiful, I don't see any reason why diamonds should be costlier than these stones. These stones have cost nothing, and my sannyasin's work was a meditation for him.\nWe have all kinds of people here. We have made all the houses ourselves. We have made the big Gurdjieff Dam, and soon we are going to double it because there is still space and we can go deeper into the mountains. We have made all our roads ... and sometime I can take you to my own road which my people have made especially for me. Perhaps I am the only man in the whole world who has a road for himself. No traffic, no need to follow any rules of the road. I can go the British way or the American way or the Russian way, it makes no problem. The whole road is available.\nAnd my people who made the road had never made roads, but they learned it immediately. You need just a little intelligence to learn anything. My people are doing all computer work. They have become so expert that now they are selling their expertise in the outside world. My people had never made any houses. Now they have become so expert that they are making houses for others in Germany, in Switzerland, in England. Cheaper, better, more comfortable, more contemporary.\nNovels will be coming. Dramas will be coming everything that man can do, we are going to do, and better. We just have to settle down.\nAnd we are settling down even against the Oregon government, the Oregonians. Nothing makes any difference -- we are settling down, we are settled -- nobody can throw us out from here.\nQ:* WOULD YOU PERSONALLY LIKE TO EVER TRAVEL AGAIN?\nA:* No, because there is nothing outside. Here, yes -- I have been to the disco yesterday. I enjoyed it!\nQ:* DID YOU DANCE?\nA:* Yes.\nQ:* I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES FROM ONE OF YOUR INTERVIEWS THIS PAST WEEK THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO MAKE LOVE TO A WOMAN ANY MORE -- YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY FOR THOSE GYMNASTICS -- BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE DISCO.…\nA:* I have energy for women also. I just wanted my men sannyasins not to be worried! Because if I am interested in any women, then her boyfriend is finished. It is just to solace them. I have enough energy, there is no problem. So all my male sannyasins have been immensely happy. The women sannyasins look a little sad, but I find other ways to make them happy. There is no problem.\nQ:* WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GLASSES?\nA:* That was just because of these lights, my eyes were feeling teary. Continuous exposure for two hours in the morning or two and a half hours, two and a half hours in the evening, my eyes started feeling teary. That's why I used those glasses; I don't need them now that they have managed to put the lights a little farther away. I think they need still to adjust because I can feel the strain on the eyes a little. Otherwise, my eyes ... you just look at my eyes.\nPeople think they get hypnotized ... I don't know. Journalists avoid looking into the eyes that perhaps they may get hypnotized. And for me it is such a simple job that I don't need to exert too much energy -- just a little smile toward a woman is enough.\nI don't have to chase her and go through all the dramas and traumas. There is no need. In my whole life I have never met a single woman who was not ready the moment I looked into her eyes. Where she was going to find such a simple man who has not even asked her name, who has not asked her address? And on the next railway station, I get down and we shall never meet again. The introduction has not happened, but I have made love to the woman.\nI am not British. They will not do anything without introduction.\nBut to me everything is love. Talking to my people is making love to them. My words reaching into their hearts create orgasmic reactions in their being. Just coming and going, dancing with my people ... just for a second stopping to dance with someone, and that's enough. That woman is not going to sleep the whole night -- you can ask the woman -- she is going to dream continuously of the dance.\nI have already made love. To me love is nothing in particular to do with sex. there are a thousand and one ways of making love. Sex is the lowest, the animal heritage. And I would like my people to rise above biology. Only then will they be really free. Then you can find thousands of ways of making love. Just sitting silently together doing nothing, but full of love for each other, and there is a certain meeting which is happening between the two energies. So I am continuously making love to my people in every kind of possible way.\nDon't be worried about my energy. And don't be worried about my eyes. They are perfectly okay and I am a non-serious man, so I have the freedom to say anything that comes to my mind without ever bothering about the consequences. And my whole life's experience is such that nothing has ever gone wrong. So I have become absolutely certain that nothing ever goes wrong, you just have to trust existence. And whatever happens is right.\nYou meet my people and you ask them ... everybody will say I have made love to them. Talking is a way of making love. Dancing is a way of making love. But these are higher qualities of love. Animals cannot understand it; you can go on playing the flute and the buffalo will go on chewing the grass. She will not even stop to look at what you are doing. The flute makes no sense to her. But to the lover, you play the flute and something immediately starts transmitting from your song and showering on your beloved.\nAnd my people are searching all possibilities, finding all possibilities of being in love. Sex is only one of them, and the very lowest of the kind. In fact, everybody should have a film of himself making love and see it once in awhile. Then he will see what kind of gymnastics and what happens to the woman's face -- distortions, and you call it orgasm? She is having a fit. And the man is trying so hard, huffing, puffing.\nEverybody should have a film of his own lovemaking just to see it whenever the desire arises. Just see the film and that will be enough. That is the very lowest type of thing that is available to all animals. Man can manage to have many other dimensions, many other levels. And the higher you reach towards enlightenment, new dimensions open up.\nFor a man who has passed through the door to the other side, everything is love. My whole twenty-four hours, I am making love to existence in different ways. If I am taking a shower, I enjoy it as much as making love to a woman. So what is the difference? I am contacting existence through water. It is not necessary that I should make the contact with existence through a feminine body.\nEating, I am making love, because I eat with such joy. And I don't see any difference. My joy is the same. So twenty-four hours I am in love. It does not matter what I am doing. That you can take as a criterion of the man who has gone beyond enlightenment: whatever he does is love. Whatever he says is love. If he does nothing, that is love. If he remains silent, that is love.\nNow, should we start dancing?\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #21 Chapter title: none 7 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH KNBC-TV, LOS ANGELES, CA\nQUESTION:* HOW SHOULD I ADDRESS YOU? WHAT NAME DO YOU PREFER?\nANSWER:* Whatever you like.\nQ:* CHOICES MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ME. ALL RIGHT.\nA:* Choices are always difficult.\nQ:* DURING THE THREE YEARS OF YOUR SILENCE, WAS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL IN THE WORLD OCCURRING THAT ALARMS YOU? MORE SO THAN WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED PREVIOUSLY?\nA:* Two things: One is that nuclear weapons are coming to a point where either we have to stop producing them totally, or we have to be ready to evaporate from this planet. The second thing that has been of tremendous significance is the discovery of the disease AIDS.\nNow it seems humanity is between two ditches. Almost walking on a razor's edge. Either nuclear weapons will destroy it, or the disease AIDS will destroy it. The destruction is becoming more, more probable than it was before.\nIt is easy to control the politicians, convince the politicians not to go forward, but how to convince the virus that creates AIDS, and how to convince the people to turn away from all the perversions that religions have forced upon their sexuality? AIDS is the culmination of homosexuality, lesbianism and all kinds of perversions.\nBut the source is religious insistence on celibacy, which is unnatural. If you force people to be celibate, and you force men and women to live separately in monasteries and nunneries, homosexuality is bound to happen. You cannot prevent it, because man's sexuality will have to have to find some way out.\nAnd AIDS is the ultimate of that perversion. They don't know that there is any possibility to find a cure for it. Almost all the experts are agreed that a person who has confirmed AIDS is going to die within two years.\nBut within two years he can spread the disease to thousands of people. By sexual contact, just by kissing somebody, and a few experts are even suspecting that it may be contracted by breathing. Then we are on wildfire, which can spread all over the earth without any limitation.\nIt seems everything is against humanity. It is as if this planet is going to die. That's why I started speaking again. I felt that seeing the death of the planet just as an observer is irresponsibility. I have to respond to the situation, and I am spreading -- through my sannyasins, through mass media, in every possible way\n-- how we can destroy the idea of celibacy from religions, how we can convert homosexuals into heterosexuals, how we can convince the women's liberation movement that lesbianism is not liberation but sheer stupidity, and how we can create an atmosphere around the world that will force politicians to stop piling up more and more nuclear weapons.\nIt is almost an impossible task, but not absolutely impossible, and when the life of the whole planet is at risk, everything should be done to prevent it. Every intelligent man's door should be knocked on. It is time to take the challenge and come out.\nThe artists, the painters, the scientists, the dancers, the musicians, all the creative people around the world should declare that any government that goes on piling up nuclear weapons is anti-people, anti-humanity.\nQ:* YOU SPEAK OF CHANGING HUMAN NATURE. NOW THAT THE VIRUS AIDS IS HERE, IT IS PRESENT, IT IS THERE. NOW THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE IN EXISTENCE. IS CHANGING HUMAN NATURE AKIN TO CLOSING THE BARN DOOR AFTER THE ANIMAL HAS ESCAPED, NOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY HERE?\nA:* Changing human nature can make a lot of difference, because AIDS is not a natural disease.\nQ:* HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?\nA:* Because all the medical experts are agreed that it is a by-product of homosexuality. No heterosexual couple who has remained together without sexual contacts with other people has come up with AIDS. Homosexuality -- if we can simply convince the popes and the imams and Ayatollah Khomeini and all these idiots to stop this idea of celibacy -- allow your monks, your nuns to make love, and allow humanity freedom from the guilt of making love, don't make it a sin. At this moment every resource should be used to convert\nperversions back to nature. Heterosexuality is a natural phenomenon. And out of heterosexuality there is no possibility of AIDS.\nSecondly, the very fact that we have so many nuclear weapons that we can destroy the whole humanity 700 times is enough, if everybody comes to know about what the politicians are doing. Even the politicians are no more so enthusiastic about a nuclear war. They can also see that in this war nobody is going to be defeated and nobody is going to be victorious. This war is a global suicide, it is not war. Just a huge amount of nuclear weapons is enough to prevent it being used.\nSo I am not without hope. I see every possibility that we can change the course where we are going unconsciously. There is no need for AIDS to be there, and there is no need for a nuclear war to be there. In fact, we can change the nuclear energy into creative sources. We can make this earth a beautiful garden without hunger, without poverty, without disease. It will be simply idiotic to use so much energy for destroying innocent people, and for destroying the only planet around here that is alive.\nQ:* ARE YOU GETTING USED TO THE TAPE CHANGES, THE INTERRUPTIONS?\nA:* I am accustomed to every kind of change.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, WE HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS DURING YOUR THREE YEARS OF SILENCE ABOUT YOU OWN HEALTH. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?\nA:* I am feeling better.\nQ:* THE BACK PROBLEMS, THE ALLERGIES, THEY ARE IMPROVING?\nA:* No, they are there, but these are not sicknesses which can ever be cured. You have to take care and avoid the situations in which they can occur. I am as allergic as I have ever been, but all the possibilities of allergy are prevented. I don't come in contact with any perfume. I don't come in contact with crowds, perspiration, smells, dust. Then I am perfectly okay, there is no problem. Those allergies are not diseases -- they are simply my heritage.\nQ:* ARE THEY FRUSTRATIONS, LIMITING YOUR...?\nA:* No, no frustration in it. In fact, it keeps me absolutely clean. And it keeps me isolated, which I enjoy. Because to be silent and alone gives the greatest bliss that is possible in life.\nSo I don't take allergies as a disadvantage -- it has proved a blessing in disguise. My back also has been a blessing in disguise. It is the same -- the problem is there. The best experts in India and from England confirmed that it is not something that will leave me. I will have to live with it.\nAnd, you will be surprised, because of my back, only Rolls Royce suits me. No other car, no other chair. So you can see the blessing in disguise: my back has brought Rolls Royces to me.\nQ:* SO THAT'S THE REASON! I'VE BEEN WONDERING!\nA:* Yes, that's the reason. Everybody has been wondering, but that is the reason. I keep people wondering about many things.\nQ:* HOW CAN A MAN WHO LIKES ROLLS ROYCES DISLIKE SPAGHETTI?\nA:* That is a long story! I used to have a very beautiful woman around me -- an Italian woman -- twenty years ago. I don't think she ever took a bath. She was simple against it, it seems. She smelled... just disgusting! But she was a beautiful woman.…\nAt that time I was not aware that I am allergic. The day I became aware that I am allergic, I got rid of that woman. She was the first woman who brought spaghetti to me, and it smelled of her. That's why I am against spaghetti -- even the name of spaghetti reminds me of that woman, and I immediately start feeling that my attack of athsma is coming. Otherwise, I have nothing against spaghetti.\nQ:* LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT MAY BE LESS PLEASANT THAN SPAGHETTI, OR MORE UNPLEASANT.…\nA:* No, nothing is more unpleasant.…\nQ:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR FOLLOWERS WHEN YOU PASS ON?\nA:* Who cares? What was happening to them when I was not here? The world goes on. When I was not here -- it is not a problem to me -- what was happening in the world was happening.\nI was not here, I was not responsible for it. When I am gone, to you I am gone; to me you are gone. So the curtain falls.\nQ:* WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU NOW TO BE HERE, TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES, TO REMAIN IN OREGON, TO HAVE THE ATTORNEYS FIGHTING THE BATTLES WITH IMMIGRATION?\nA:* I enjoy fighting. And because I have found the most backward people here in Oregon, I have chosen it. The fight is going to be long. The longer it goes, the longer it will keep me alive. The longer it goes, the stronger it will make my people. And we are on the right path.\nWe are fighting for those values America stands for, and they are fighting against America. We are fighting for the Constitution of America, and they are doing everything against the Constitution. So it has to be seen who wins. We may be a small minority, but I promise you that we are going to win in every case against the state of Oregon.\nAnd we are going to prove to these people that it is not so easy to go against the only constitution in the world which has some democratic fragrance about it.\nQ:* DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, OR DO THEY HAVE TO BE DEFEATED?\nA:* I don't want to persuade anybody. Either they defeat me, or I defeat them. No compromise.\nTruth knows no compromise. The lies always are ready to compromise. Naturally, because in compromise, truth will always be the loser and the lie will always be the gainer. The lie is zero, it has nothing to lose.\nYes, the state government has been trying to compromise. The federal government has been sending their mediators to compromise. I am not going to compromise, and when the other party is trying to compromise, that shows where they are. They know that if they don't compromise, they are going to lose the whole thing. And why should I compromise when I know that the whole thing is going to be mine?\nQ:* WHEN YOU USE PHRASES THAT ARE TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE OF OREGON AND OTHERS AS INFLAMMATORY IN YOUR DISCOURSES.… YOU HAVE REFERRED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HELD VERY DEARLY BY PEOPLE HERE ... BY PHRASES SUCH AS \"POPE THE POLACK,\" \"CHRIST THE CRACKPOT,\" \"MOTHER TERESA, THE CRIMINAL.\" ARE THOSE PHRASES INTENDED TO BRING ENLIGHTENMENT TO PEOPLE, OR DO THEY INSTEAD FILL THE HEARTS OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH SUCH HATRED THAT THEY CANNOT HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\nA:* It works in many ways. Those are my devices. First, I am talking to my own people. They are not hurt by what I am saying about Pope the Polack, Teresa the Terrible, Christ the Crackpot -- nobody is hurt. On the contrary, they start looking at things in a totally new way, the way I want them to look at them.\nI want outside people to get hurt, shocked. I want them to be angry, hateful, because it is a very fundamental principle of psychology that if you can create hate in a man, it is very easy to change it into love. Love and hate are not so\ndifferent as people think, and certainly they are not opposites. They are two polarities of one energy, just like darkness and light.\nSo without going anywhere, just sitting in my room, I can manage to give shocks all around the world, shake people in their sleep, in their slumber. Because to me their Christianity is a kind of opium, and their Hinduism is a kind of marijuana, and so on, so forth. These people need to be shaken really badly.\nAnd I will go on throwing ice-cold water on their eyes as long as they don't open their eyes and jump out of the bed. It is not a question of persuasion. You don't persuade a sleeping person to wake up, because between a person who is awake and a person who is asleep there is no possibility of communication. So whether they hear me or not, I want them to be hateful against me, that's enough -- I have done my job. All these people.…\nAnd there are almost one million sannyasins around the world. Even in Soviet Russia, even in East Germany I have my sannyasins. Of course, they are underground sannyasins. From where are these people coming? First they were shocked, first they were hurt, but their shock and their hurt started a great question, a great quest in their minds.\nThey became suspicious about their own conditioning: Perhaps Christ was a crackpot? Let us give it another thought. And Pope is certainly the Polack, there are not two opinions about it, and you cannot find a thicker head than Pope the Polack's, because the world is suffering from overpopulation, and he is preaching around the world against birth control, against the pill, against abortion.\nThis man -- if I call him a criminal, I am not condemning him, only describing him -- perhaps he is the greatest criminal alive. And the same is my attitude about the Hindu leader, shankaracharya, Mohammedan leaders like Ayatollah Khomeini -- I call him Khomeiniac -- because these are the people who are insisting on more and more population on the earth.\nEthiopia is dying, India is dying, soon the third world will be dying of starvation. And who will be responsible for it? Mother Teresa will be responsible for it, Pope will be responsible for it. In the eyes of the future, these people will be as criminal as middle ages popes are criminal in our eyes. They burned innocent old women, just calling them witches. So what? If somebody wants to be a witch\n-- the word is not bad, it just means a wise woman -- so whose business is it to prevent?\nIn the middle ages, the same popes representing the same Jesus Christ, calling themselves infallible, burned thousands of women alive because they decided that they are in conspiracy with the devil. Now no intelligent person today can stand on their side in that matter. They themselves feel ashamed. In fact, they burned Joan of Arc as a witch, but it was so much against people's love for that courageous young woman that finally after three hundred years, they changed their verdict.\nOne infallible pope burns the woman alive, declares her a witch; another infallible pope declares Joan of Arc a saint. From the grave the bones are pulled out and worshipped.\nNow these idiots -- you want me to be polite with them? And they are dragging the whole world towards poverty. They have a vested interest in poverty -- they have to be exposed. Mother Teresa wants more and more orphans in the world; otherwise who is going to give her Nobel prizes and all kinds of awards and titles? She is roaming around the world -- I don't know when she finds time for serving humanity -- receiving rewards, awards, titles, opening functions, conferences. I can't think when she serves humanity. All she is doing is collecting Hindu and Mohammedan orphans and converting them into Catholics. This is sheer politics of number, she is a cunning politician. It is not even right to call her a woman -- she has no heart. She is simply a puppet in the hands of the Vatican.\nQ:* IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT A CHILD DYING OF STARVATION AND NOT TO FEEL A TUG AT YOUR HEART, A DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD?\nA:* I will do something for the child: I will give him an injection and send him into eternal sleep. That is my compassion. To keep him alive for his whole life to starve again and again, fall sick, create more children who will be sick, who will be again orphans -- this is sheer stupidity.\nI am a simple man of mathematics. If Ethiopia is dying, my compassion says there is no point in sending food, because these Ethiopians with that food will crate more Ethiopians. This is not a solution.\nEither give them so much that they can live at your standard of living -- but for that you will have to stop all your nuclear weapons and all your war efforts and all the money that you go on pouring into them. Or, if you cannot do that -- and nobody is willing to do that -- these hypocrites go on calling themselves compassionate. What kind of compassion is this?\n[text missing here in change from tape one, side A to side B]\n... a little butter to the Ethiopians. For four years they have been dying, because for four years there has been no rain. And now every day thousands of people are dying. All over the world politicians feel compassionate. They send a little bit, but their gifts prove to be only spoonfuls of sugar thrown into the ocean to make it sweet.\nNo, I am not so gullible. I can see the point is either, if you want to destroy poverty from the earth, stop war, stop all this nonsense of America and Soviet Union; or, be at least honest and say we cannot save Ethiopia, we cannot save India.\nWhy allow those people to starve and suffer? We can easily send medical teams -\n- I can send my own medical team. And this is such a simple affair, just one injection and the person goes into eternal sleep. And there is no problem, because if the soul is eternal, as all the religions say, then you have not done anything. Just the house was falling and you have moved the soul into a new house, a better house, a fresher house.\nBut if all these religions are wrong and communists and materialists are right, then too, there is no problem. They say when the body dies, everything dies, there is no soul left -- no problem is there. So whether one believes in the soul or does not believe in the soul, it is better to let these poor people at least die peacefully. You could not help them to live peacefully, joyously, but you can at least send them to death peacefully, silently. That is my compassion.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OTHER MISFORTUNATE SOULS.…\nA:* You can ask about anything, because I have no secrets to keep about anything, I have nothing private, I am absolutely open to all kinds of queries. And I am going to say exactly what everybody wants to say, but they don't have the guts to say it. And I don't care about any respectability -- I am already notorious enough. And I enjoy it.\nQ:* YOU ENJOY IT? HOW SO?\nA:* Yes, I enjoy it. To be respectable means bourgeois; to be notorious means rebellious. Every revolutionary will be notorious in his time, and every respectable person is nothing but in the service of the vested interests. Certainly, you don't give Nobel prizes to notorious people like me. You give Nobel prizes to Mother Teresa. She is respected because she is serving your vested interests.\nI am notorious, but I enjoy it. I don't want to be respectable. To be respected this mad humanity is insulting.\nQ:* LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PERHAPS MADE YOU NOTORIOUS IN THIS HUMANITY -- BRINGING THE UNFORTUNATE SOULS I WAS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT EARLIER, THE HOBOS, THE TRANSIENTS, THE DERELICTS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE LAST FALL. DID YOU APPROVE OF THAT? WAS THAT A WISE THING TO DO?\nA:* We enjoyed doing it, and it was the best thing to do. And we are going to do something better soon, so you will forget about it completely. And each year we are going to do something better. That's the only way.\nWhen you have a headache and you feel it is unbearable, I will just set fire to your house, and soon you will forget all about your headache.\nQ:* WHY DID THOSE MEN NOT FORGET ABOUT THEIR HEADACHES? WHY COULDN'T THEY ADAPT HERE? WHY DID THEY LEAVE?\nA:* Because they were uneducated, because they had been provided for their whole life food, clothes and other things by the churches and Christian associations, to live a life of misery on the streets. Those people were retarded.\nQ:* BUT YOU KNEW THAT. WHY DID YOU STILL BRING THEM HERE?\nA:* I tried it as an experiment. Those who could understand me are still here. Those who could not, they have left -- they were free. In an experiment, you have to take the risk.\nI am going to take a greater risk soon. Q:* COULD YOU AMPLIFY ON THAT?\nA:* No.\nQ:* WHEN WILL YOU?\nA:* Not right now. It is going to be declared in a world press conference. It is not a simple, small thing. It is really big.\nQ:* BUT THE INTENT IS TO BRING THE WORD TO ADDITIONAL PEOPLE?\nA:* No. Just to bring more notoriety to me!\nQ:* ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS COMMUNE HAS DEVELOPED? LET ME ASK IN PARTICULAR ABOUT ALL THE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS THAT APPARENTLY HAVE BECOME NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMUNE. IS THAT THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH YOU LIVE TO LIVE?\nA:* No. Your question is wrong. I am absolutely happy with the commune and its development.\nBut behind the question, you are being journalistic. You are saying, \"To save the integrity of the community there are guns and guards.\" That is absolutely wrong.\nQ:* WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THEM, THEN?\nA:* The reason for those guards is because I have been attacked many times in my life: I have been poisoned; an attempt was made to kill me with a knife before then thousand sannyasins -- and twenty police officers, because they got the message that something was going to happen that morning, so they reached in time before the knife was thrown at me. The man was caught red-handed. Ten thousand witness, twenty police officers as witnesses -- and still the man was freed by the court with punishment.\nNow, if my people feel to protect me, I am not going to interfere, for the simple reason that I don't interfere. If somebody is going to assassinate me, I will say hi to him, too. I will not interfere.\nAnd if my people who love me want to protect me -- and what protection? In a nuclear world, do you think those guns mean anything? Except for their love for me, those guns are toy guns. What can they do?\nBut I respect their love. I don't care about their guns. And those guns are not for the integrity of the community. The community is integrated on its own. Those guns have nothing to do with it. And those guns have not been used for four years to harm anybody. And they will never be used to harm anybody.\nBut if somebody tries to harm the community, certainly, we will do everything to fight back. I believe in tit for tat.\nQ:* THE COMMUNE HERE DEFENDING ITSELF IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME ATTACK -- IS THAT IN CONCEPT ANY DIFFERENT FROM A NATION STOCKPILING NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM AN ATTACK?\nA:* No.\nQ:* I GATHER FROM YOUR CONDEMNATION, THEN, OF STOCKPILING NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH WHAT THE COMMUNE IS DOING.\nA:* No. I am not stockpiling nuclear weapons here, and I won't allow my commune to stockpile nuclear weapons. And I don't want nations not to have armies, not to have other weapons. I am just against nuclear weapons. Other weapons are just a football match, and man is an animal -- once in a while there is an itch to fight.\nI am in favor of pre-first-world-war weapons. Do your best -- those weapons were perfectly good. And the world was a far more pleasant place to live before the first world war, because the population was small, and your wars helped to keep the balance of population. You need wars.\nI am not a pacifist. I think if wars completely disappear, it will be a loss. It is perfectly good for this mad humanity once in a while to erupt into a war, destroy a few people, because they were surplus, and keep the balance.\nI am against nuclear weapons because that will destroy the whole humanity and then there will be no fourth world war. And that I don't like! I would love fourth world war, fifth world, war, and history goes on. But this third world war is dangerous -- it simply puts a full point on history. That's why I am against it.\nOtherwise, I am not against war. It is just children playing. Let them play -- there is no harm. So if my commune wants to collect pre-first-world-war weapons, I am for it!\nQ:* I DON'T THINK THEY HAD OUZIS IN WORLD WAR I, DID THEY?\nA:* They are not nuclear weapons. They are freely available in the market, anybody can purchase them. The government does not think them serious weapons. Anybody who wants to purchase them in any numbers can purchase them. They are freely available.\nAnd if Oregonians have them, I will not prevent my people. If Oregonians have one, my people will have two, because in a game you should not lag behind. And what does it matter? People have to die anyway.\nAnd the strangest thing is that most of people -- ninety-nine percent of people -- die on their beds. That is the most dangerous place! Ninety-nine percent. Only one percent manage to die in varieties of ways.\nSo this is nothing wrong. Just if people want to fight, have a good fight -- enjoy it, celebrate it! Oregonians will be fighting with hostility and we will be fighting with songs and dances and celebration.\nPerhaps they will be able to kill us, but they cannot kill our spirit -- the spirit of ecstasy. And that will haunt them more. The ghost of Rajneeshpuram may haunt the whole of America!\nQ:* THAT'S AN OMINOUS STATEMENT. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A VISION? IS THIS COMMUNE GOING TO BECOME SOME FORM OF MARTYR?\nA:* No, no. I am just joking!\nQ:* HOW MUCH OF THE TIME ARE YOU JOKING?\nA:* All the time!... One hundred percent! I am absolutely a non-serious person, so I can say anything because a non-serious person has no bondage.\nQ:* BUT WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY?\nA:* They are foolish! They should learn to take me non-seriously, the way I take the whole world non-seriously. If they don't learn it, then they unnecessarily get terrified, go through nervous breakdowns. I am absolutely non-serious. What I\nam saying to you, I may contradict tomorrow -- or if you want, right now! I can do that, too.\nJust don't change the cassette in the middle!\nQ:* YOU AT TIMES HAVE SPOKEN WELL OF SOME OF THE THINGS JESUS SAID, SOME OF THE WORDS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO BUDDHA, TO MOHAMMED. AND I HAVE ALSO UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THAT MUCH OF WHAT THEY DID THAT IS GOOD WAS LOST IN THE FORMALISM OF THEIR FOLLOWERS, WHAT THE FOLLOWERS TRIED TO ESTABLISH. I WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU SEE A PARALLEL HAPPENING IN THIS COMMUNE HERE -- THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS BEING LOST IN THE FORMALISM OF YOUR FOLLOWERS?\nA:* No. It is impossible. First I have to remind you that whatever I have said about Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed -- and that there is much good in them which has been lost by their followers -- is centuries old. You are quoting Old Testament, and I am now in the middle of the LAST TESTAMENT.\nThose statements belonged three and a half years ago, before I went into silence. And do you know why I went into silence for three and a half years? Because I got tired of telling beautiful things about Jesus, knowing perfectly well that he was a crackpot.\nQ:* WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT, THEN?\nA:* Because I wanted to catch hold of Christians, and I got them! I have my devices -- I may be a madman but I have my methodology.\nQ:* DO THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS?\nA:* Yes.\nQ:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN MACHIAVELLI? IS THAT PART OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY?\nA:* Machiavelli can be my disciple, and he will enjoy learning a few more things that he has missed. I spoke on Jesus and I said he had said many beautiful things. And I interpreted him, but that interpretation was mine. It has nothing to do with Jesus. I was simply trying to catch hold of a few Christians, but that I was doing with all the religions.\nIt is natural, because all the people of the world are already divided. When I came into this world, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu -- no customer available! And I have to do my business, too. I have every right. So, how to get customers?\nI had to plan devices. And the natural way was -- the simpler way -- that anything that is wrong in Jesus, throw it on his disciples. And anything that can be seen as good, can be polished, given a more contemporary ring, bring it above and give the credit to Jesus.\nGreat Christians like Stanley Jones, who was a world-famous missionary, he told me, \"I am puzzled. No Christian down the centuries has even been able to give such beautiful meaning to the words of Jesus.\" I said, \"The trouble is, I cannot tell you the truth.\" That poor fellow is dead now -- but to you I can tell the truth: What beauty can be in Jesus' words? He was uneducated, uncultured, a carpenter's son. In his time it was said laughingly, \"Look at the Messiah. Who\nhas ever heard that prophets and messiahs are born in Bethlehem?\" Bethlehem became a laughing stock because of Jesus, and he was looked at like a buffoon. Riding on his donkey, proclaiming himself as the only begotten son of God.… Just see it, visualize it: a man sitting on a donkey looking like a perfect hippie, declaring he is the only begotten son of God, and telling you, \"Unless you follow me, there is no way to be saved. At the last judgment day, I will choose my sheep and they will enter into paradise. And those who are not chosen by me, will fall into eternal hell.\"\nAnd have you ever thought of the meaning of eternal hell? In a seventy-year life, how man sins can you commit to deserve eternal hell? Is there any fairness, justice in existence, or not? In seventy years -- because Christians believe in only one life -- how many sins can you manage to commit to deserve eternal punishment? This is simply stupid. Because of this simple statement, Bertrand Russell went against Jesus and he wrote a book, WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN, because this is simply unfair, unjust, inhuman. And the man certainly is a mental case.\nNow I have got my people -- from all sources I have caught them, from Buddhists, from Hindus, from Christians, from Jews. From every land, from every country, from every race, I have caught hold of those who can now listen to me directly, and I don't need any Jesus, any Buddha, any Mohammed to stand between me and my disciples. So I am kicking them out.\nFor three years I remained silent, just to give a gap so people forget all about what I said before those three years, and I can start from the very beginning again. So don't quote anything from my books. Those days are dead -- those books are dead.\nQ:* DO YOU WEAR THAT WATCH EXCEPT DURING TV INTERVIEWS?\nA:* I have got hundreds of watches. And this is the least costly -- just $180,000. I have watches which are a half-million dollars, or more. And I have hundreds -- but they don't belong to me, they belong to my sannyasins. This watch, too, is borrowed. Nothing belongs to me; everything is provided for me. I am just a guest here in this commune. I am not even a sannyasin.\nQ:* IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY, THAT YOU SAW SPEAKING HIGHLY OF JESUS AS A STRATEGY TO APPEAL TO CHRISTIANS, TO GET YOUR WORD TO THEM, AS A TACTIC. DO YOU HAVE NEW TACTICS NOW? IS YOUR TALKING TO US THIS EVENING -- IS THIS PART OF A NEW TACTIC TO REACH PEOPLE?\nA:* Everything I do is a certain device. Talking to you, too. I am involved in some great alchemical work of transforming people from their sleep into enlightened souls, and I have to try every kind of device possible.\nThis, too, is part of it. Everything that I say or do is part -- organic part -- of my whole work. And my work is to bring to people awakening on as big a scale as possible, as it has never happened before.\nQ:* YOU USED THE FIGURE EARLIER, IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY, OF A MILLION SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD. WOULD THAT BE YOUR ESTIMATE?\nA:* Yes.\nQ:* I HAVE READ -- I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY ASCERTAINED THE ACCURACY OF THIS -- THAT A NUMBER OF YOUR MEDITATION CENTERS BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE HAVE CLOSED, AND THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DRAWN FROM THAT IS THAT THE NUMBER OF SANNYASINS IS SHRINKING.\nA:* Their conclusion is wrong. We have closed a few centers because those centers were too small, and the sannyasins were finding it difficult to live amongst the hostility around them. So we have consolidated a few centers into a big commune. So those centers have disappeared, but a new commune has come into existence.\nThe number has not decreased, the number has increased because many who were afraid before to become sannyasins are no more afraid because they have five hundred sannyasins with them. Now their enemies are afraid.\nI am consolidating all over the world, and the number is increasing every day. From a half-million it has reached to one million, and these are above-ground sannyasins. The underground sannyasins are not included in it.\nIn communist countries, in China, in Russia, in other small communist countries I have my sannyasins, and they are spreading fast there, too. In fact, they are more excited than sannyasins anywhere else. Naturally, human psychology is such that in Moscow they have to meet in a basement of a friend's house -- silently, afraid even the walls in Russia are detectives and belong to the KGB.\nThere is great excitement in meditation, in reading my books, listening to my tapes. For sixty years in Russia, religion had almost disappeared except in a few places which the Russian government has been keeping up for tourist purposes. Only a few churches are there which are maintained for foreigners to visit and see that religion has not been disturbed. Everybody is free -- and you can see.\nBut in fact all the churches have become either hospitals or schools, and the whole country has become atheistic. After sixty years, these people were born after the revolution. They have been brought up in an atheist atmosphere. They have been conditioned that there is nothing in you -- you are only a component of physics, chemistry, biology, but there is no spirit in you.\nAnd for the first time they are becoming aware through me that they are consciousness. All these things are just their house, and they are not just a composite whole of all these things; they have an individuality, a consciousness. And the only way to discover it is meditation, and people are meditating.\nAnd the government is already starting to persecute them, trying to find out where they meet, what they do, where they go. They have started taking my books from them. My books are banned. These are good signs -- this means the youth will get more excited. It has become a revolution, and that's what the young blood always needs -- some rebellion.\nI have one million people, and they will be growing every day for the simple reason that there is no other alternative. The old world is already dead -- or almost dead, which is worse!\nAnd for the new world there is no other movement except this movement. It is not a political movement. It does not belong to any nation. It does not belong to any race. It does not belong to the past. It is absolutely fresh -- just born, young.\nAnd you are asking: Can your followers do the same as happened with Jesus? In the first place, the followers have not destroyed Jesus, Jesus had everything ready. He had sown the seeds, the followers have only been reaping the crop. Jesus is responsible.\nI am not giving any theology to my disciples. I am not giving them any catechism. I am not giving them any belief system. And my statements are so contradictory, that there is no possibility for anybody to figure out what kind of man this was. Nobody can bring any deformation, because I am not giving anything to the disciples -- no discipline, no dogma, no creed. What can they do? I am giving them freedom to do whatsoever they want to do. I am giving their responsibility to themselves. I am not taking their responsibility on me. I am not their savior or prophet or messiah, no.\nQ:* YOU ARE THEIR MASTER.\nA:* I am master of myself!\nQ:* ARE YOU THEIR MASTER, AS WELL?\nA:* No. I am trying to help them to be masters of themselves. I am just a catalytic agent. I am master of myself, so I know how one becomes a master of oneself. I am simply sharing my experience with these people. They are not my followers, they are my fellow travelers. And they are absolutely free to do anything they want. No restrictions, no inhibitions, no repressions.\nWhat can they do? The moment I am gone, they will also go on their way separately, because their connection with me is direct. They are not interconnected like Christians or Hindus or Mohammedans. They are connected to me directly. Each sannyasin has a direct communication line with me. The moment I am gone, his last barrier is also finished. Other barriers I had finished before -- now the last barrier, the love towards me, is also finished.\nHe is now totally free. Utterly free -- to be himself. So there is no problem. The followers of Buddha or Confucius they all destroyed their Master's things because the Master himself has given all the poison that was needed to destroy it. For example, Buddhas has given 33,000 rules of conduct. Even to remember them is impossible, the question of following them does not arise. And any man trying to follow 33,000 rules of conduct will soon be in an insane asylum. He will be in the same position as happened in Aesop's fable of the centipede.\nA centipede is just going for his morning walk. One hundred legs -- a small rabbit could not believe his eyes, how he managed to walk. One hundred legs? Which one first, which one second, which one third? He stopped the centipede and said, \"Uncle, I have a question if you don't mind. How do you manage to walk with one hundred legs? He said, \"My God, I never thought about it! Now I will watch how I walk and then I will tell you. Up to now I have been simply walking without thinking.\"\nAnd he could not walk even a single step. He fell down, because he was trying to figure out which leg first and which leg second -- and the number was one hundred. Even a great mathematician like Albert Einstein would have fallen with one hundred legs. That poor centipede -- knowing no arithmetic.\nBut the centipede was very angry and told the rabbit, \"It's okay that you asked the question to me, but here is a big commune of other centipedes. Don't ask such a stupid question to anybody. Perhaps you have crippled me for my whole life! I will never be able to walk again, because I don't know how I used to walk. It was simply natural.\"\n33,000 rules of conduct? Are you trying to drive humanity insane? And if they don't follow, they feel guilty. If they follow, they look mad. And if you look at those rules, you will be absolutely aware. For example, one sannyasin, Buddha's disciple, was going to spread his message. Buddha said to him, \"Never look at a woman. You are going far away.\"\nThe man said, \"It is a little bit difficult, because half the people are women. Everywhere is full of women, and you are giving me a message not to look at a\nwoman? But how am I supposed to know before looking that a woman is coming? And by the time I know that she is a woman, I have already looked.\" The man raised the question that it would be almost impossible for him to follow it, Buddha gave him the advice, \"No, it is possible. I will give you the clue. You walk looking just four feet ahead of you, so if you see a woman's feet, you know. Don't look up, always keep your eyes glued four feet away.\" In India, women use ornaments on the feet, on the toes, and just by looking at the feet you will know it is a woman.\nThe man was a little of a philosopher. He said, \"That's okay. Anything else?\" Buddha said, \"Never touch a woman.\" The man said, \"But there can be a situation.… For example, a woman is drowning and I am standing on the bank. What do you want me to do, jump in the river and save the woman, or just go on my way without looking at her? A woman may have fallen on the street sick or old or blind and she needs the help of someone to take her at least to the nearest town, and I am passing by. What do you suggest?\"\nBuddha said, \"Okay, you can touch a woman, but remain absolutely alert. Keep yourself as a witness, don't get in any way involved. Do it as if she is only a corpse, and you are fulfilling your duty.\"\nNow this kind of discipline will soon create disturbances. People are going to disobey such things and find loopholes and destroy the whole thing.\nI have not given them anything in which they can find loopholes -- I have given them only loopholes. Now what can they destroy? It is said a fishing net consists of holes. I have given them only holes,no fishing net. Now they can do whatsoever they want to do with holes. I give them absolute freedom to be themselves. No guilt, no promise, just enjoy the moment to the fullest, and you\nare not responsible to anybody.\nNo God to be responsible towards, no hell to be afraid of, no heaven to be greedy for. All that is present this very moment, enjoy it intensely, totally, because no one knows -- the next moment may come, may not come.\nYou want to do something?\nQ:* BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU THINK WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CATEGORIZE YOU, BUT WHAT CONCLUSIONS DO YOU THINK HISTORY WILL REACH ABOUT YOUR EXPERIMENT HERE?\nA:* I don't know\nQ:* AND FURTHERMORE, YOU DON'T CARE!\nA:* I don't care. Who cares when you are dead; you are not going to come back to read what others are writing about you, whether your name is in the history books or not. What is the point?\nAlexander the Great did so much, tried to conquer the whole known world, almost succeeded. But what is the point? He died when he was thirty-three, and after that he has not been seen around -- reading history and enjoying that his name is everywhere, and he is one of the greatest heroes in history. What does it matter? I don't know, and I don't care, either.\nI am perfectly happy right now, so blessed that I can bless the whole world. Still my blissfulness will not be exhausted.\nQ:* WHY SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD? YOU MENTIONED EARLIER YOUR HAPPINESS IN YOUR OWN PERSON.… WHY NOT KEEP IT WITHIN YOURSELF?\nA:* Because it goes on increasing if you share. It is profit-making.\nQ:* THERE ARE A FEW GIGGLES THERE. DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PROFIT-MAKING.\nA:* The more you share your bliss, your joy, the more it increases. It is a totally different kind of economics from that which you are aware of. In the ordinary economics the rule is if you go on sharing your money, it will decrease.\nIn the higher economics, which is my business, the more you share, the more existence goes on pouring into you. It is just like a well: you go on drawing water from the well and new water goes on flowing from everywhere. If you stop drawing water from the well, the water will become stale, dead, even poisonous. Bliss has to be shared. It is not out of compassion. That is why I said it is profit- making. It is not out of compassion that I share my bliss. it is just out of simple profit motive. It increases the more I share. It is like the rain cloud full of rain. It has to shower somewhere, otherwise it will become heavy, burdened.\nYes, I say, if you don't share your bliss it will go stale. It will start stinking very soon. It will die. You have to share it to keep it alive, flowing, increasing, expanding. I am an imperialist. I don't believe in any limits on anything.\nI can understanding why you are scratching your beard. You don't have a beard and you are scratching it. You take a few grapes -- that will help you. That scratching is nervous. You just take some grapes! Those grapes are there just to avoid doing anything else that shows nervousness.\nBut it is something new. All journalists feel nervous, because they have never met such a crazy man before. Who will not feel nervous? You take a few grapes.\nQ:* I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOW ME A MEAL BREAK UNTIL I'M OFF WORK.\nA:* Okay.\nQ:* WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, OR WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO SELL BLISS, WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE IT AWAY?\nA:* No. Because anything that is just given away is never taken by anybody. The higher the cost, the better people will keep it, save it in their treasuries. Give it free, and it has no value, because people don't understand value unless it has a price. They understand price, they don't understand value.\nQ:* IN THAT CASE, HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE GRAPES?\nA:* Nothing.\nQ:* SO, NO VALUE?\nA:* I know that if you eat those grapes your program is going to be for me. Just taste something sweet, so you are not bitter on television. It is all profit-making business! I am a very simple man, and truthful. If you are shy about eating right now, when I go, please.…\n[the cameraman has problems]\nQ:* I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT SOME OF THE WORDS YOU JUST SAID... WHY BLISS HAS TO BE SOLD. WHY YOU SELL BLISS.\nCOULD YOU GRANT US THREE MORE MINUTES?\nA:* I can, but I cannot repeat what I have said; I will say something else. I don't believe in repetition.\nEverything in this world has to be achieved. You have to pay a price for it, and the bigger the price you pay for it, the higher is your estimate of it. If bliss, ecstasy, joy, were all available, like water, free -- nobody will be able to appreciate their value.\nYou don't know the real value of water unless you have been thirsty in a desert. While he was in India, Alexander was asked by a great Master, \"If you are in a desert and thirsty and I have a full bottle of water, how much will you be ready to pay for it?\" Alexander said, \"I will pay half my empire in such a situation.\" But the Master said, \"I will not sell until you pay me the full empire. Why should I sell? If you are willing to pay half, that is indication enough that if I just wait a little more, the customer is going to feel more thirsty and is going to pay the full empire.\"\nAnd Alexander agreed that perhaps he would give the whole empire. And the Master laughed. He said, \"Then what are you doing? Wasting your whole life for a bottle of water? Are you stupid or something?\"\nThe world understands things in its own way. Otherwise, my bliss is freely available to anybody who can appreciate it, who is vulnerable to it, who is open to receive it. There is no price tag on it. But those who cannot understand anything unless they pay for it -- for those poor people, we have to put a price on everything. It is out of compassion.\nThat's why I said my answer will not be the same. Q:* BHAGWAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nA:* I enjoyed it.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #22 Chapter title: none 8 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH THE RAJNEESH TIMES, TOKYO\nQUESTION:* BELOVED BHAGWAN, BUDDHA THE JAPANESE SEEMS QUITE CONCEIVABLE, YET, ZORBA THE JAPANESE QUITE INCONCEIVABLE. WOULD YOU COMMENT?\nANSWER:* It is one of the most significant questions to ask. Buddha is not only conceivable in Japan, a Buddhist country, Buddha will be conceivable anywhere, even though the countries are not Buddhist. Perhaps Buddha is the only human being in the whole history who is loved, respected by ALL, not only by Buddhists.\nOn the other hand, Zorba is inconceivable in every old culture, civilization, religion, because they all have condemned materialism and they all have raised spiritualism to its ultimate height. They have created a duality between matter and spirit, between the mundane and the sacred.\nZorba represents all that has been condemned for centuries upon centuries by all the religions. Buddha is loved certainly by Buddhists, but respected by non- Buddhists, too. He represents something of the purity of the highest conceivable spirituality. That's why I say the question is significant.\nMy whole effort is to bring Zorba and Buddha closer and closer -- so close that both can exist in one human being without any contradiction, as complementaries, helping each other, not fighting with each other.\nSeparately, both are missing much. Buddha is absolutely bloodless, just a skeleton, because he has denied everything that life is. Life is love, life is laughter. Buddha has denied everything. He is just a skeleton. Zorba is full of life, love, laughter. Eat, drink, and be merry is his whole religion. He does not know anything beyond eat, drink, and be merry. He does not know ... he has no question or curiosity about something that is higher -- higher than the alcohol, higher than the woman or man, higher than this world, the visible world, the tangible world.\nZorba has no quest; he is perfectly happy drinking, dancing, enjoying. Buddha is missing the blood, the life, the love, the joy, the celebration. Buddha cannot dance. It will be simply inconceivable, Buddha dancing. Zorba cannot sit silently\nand meditate. That, too, is as inconceivable as Buddha dancing. Zorba is dancing, singing, drinking. He is making love to any woman, who by chance meets him.\nZorba represents the materialist in its best form. Buddha represents the spiritualist in its best form. but you are both, spirit and body. Existence is both, matter and consciousness.\nTherefore I say that spiritualists have been denying the very base of the temple. They accept the temple but they deny the foundation of the temple, and without the foundation, no temple can stand. That's why religions have failed.\nGautam the Buddha has failed, for the simple reason that he was trying to make a temple without any foundations going down into the earth. He was trying to grow roses, but he was not ready to accept the roots under the ground which life in darkness and, of course, are not as beautiful as the roses. But neither the roses can exist without the roots, nor the roots can afford to exist without the flowers. The roots without the flowers will be barren, and the flowers without the roots can only be of plastic. so all the religions of the past have created a plastic humanity. Denying Zorba, they have denied all that is solid in you. And the materialists, communists, Marxists and other brands of materialism -- Epicurus in Greece, Charvaka in India -- they are eating, drinking, womanizing, but at the very end they find nothing but frustration.\nSomething is missing. They may have all the money, all the power, everything that a man can ask for, but still inside they are empty, hollow. They may be dancing, but their dance has nothing of divinity in it. Their dance is just an exercise of the body. There is no soul to it.\nThese are the two ways humanity has lived up to now -- divided, split, schizophrenic, both have to repress something. Buddha has to repress Zorba. Zorba has to repress Buddha. As far as I'm concerned, both are sick because both are half of one whole, which can be healthy only if both the parts meet together and fill the gaps. Zorba can become the foundation, Buddha can become the temple.\nI don't see that there is any conflict between the rose and the roots. On the contrary, the roots are continuously sending food, water, nourishment, color, fragrance to the rose. the rose is on the receiving end. All that the rose gives to you comes from the roots. Cut the roots away, and the rose dies, disappears. All fragrance, all life, all dance in the wind ... the joy in the sun ... simply withers away. Take the roses away, and what meaning is left for the roots?\nThat's why materialism is bound to come to a point where it feels meaningless, everything meaningless. It is the Zorba in the West which has come to its climax in the so-called philosophy of existentialism. Existentialism is the ultimate logical conclusion of Zorba. There is no meaning in life according to European existentialism. There is only anxiety, anguish, despair. Zorba had started with love, laughter, life, and it is strange that in the end the conclusion is that there is only one way to get rid of it all, this whole mess and madness, and that is suicide.\nThe whole Western intelligence is in a great insane space, because they have accepted only the roots and now they are asking, \"Where are the flowers?\" They never allowed the flowers to grow. On the contrary, they went on cutting the branches, the leaves, the trunk of the tree, and now they are asking the roots, \"What is the meaning of you? For what do you exist?\"\nAnd in the East, just the opposite has happened: only the spiritual is true, and the material is illusory. All the spiritual masters in the East have been emphasizing only one thing: that the world in which you live is only a dream. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor -- what does it matter if it is only a dream? Whether you are hungry, sick, old, healthy, it is only a dream. It is not the reality.\nThe natural consequence was, that in saving their spirit and their spirituality they have lost their roots. That's why the East is poor. Gautam Buddha is responsible for it. If you deny materialism, then how can science develop? If matter is illusory,then the whole scientific endeavor is illusory -- Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never happened, it was just the Japanese dreaming about it. If matter is illusory, then how can the atom be real, which is the constituent of matter? And if life is illusory,then why make so much fuss about life disappearing from the earth in a third world war.\nBecause Gautam Buddha and the people like him in other religions emphasized only the other world, this world was neglected, ignored. No science was developed, although it could have been developed long before it started to develop in the West. The Western development of science is only of the last three hundred years. Mathematics was discovered in India ten thousand years ago, but what happened? Guns and dynamite were discovered in China five thousand years ago, but then what went wrong? In three hundred years the West has developed nuclear weapons, and they have managed to reach to the moon. What has the East been doing for ten thousand years?\nYou will be surprised to know that when Marco Polo came back from China, he brought from the Chinese emperor many presents for the pope. He was laughed at about everything that he brought, and he thought he was bringing something of immense value. For example, up to that time, the West had no idea of printing machines, and he had brought printed books from china. The West had no idea of currency notes, but in China currency notes had been in use for three thousand years.\nWhat went wrong? People who invented mathematics, people who invented printing presses, people who invented guns and gunpowder...? The whole responsibility goes to Gautam Buddha and his type of people. They emphasized that all this is illusory -- don't waste time. The small time that you have got has not to be wasted in the desert of materialism. You should devote your whole life to the search for truth, for that which is far above what you see. Seek the invisible, the intangible. Seek the eternal, the immortal. Seek the immaterial.\nEmphasis from people like Buddha who had charismatic personalities influenced the whole of civilization, and for centuries all progress stopped. India knew everything about mathematics, but could not produce an Albert Einstein. If things had moved rightly, India would have reached to faraway stars by this time, not just to the moon. The moon is very close. If Western science can reach to the moon in three hundred years, India cold have reached to the farthest star in ten thousand years. All the basic principles of mathematics were known, but they were never applied. They remained theoretical. They remained undeveloped because the genius of the country was attracted by Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Shankara, who were emphasizing that matter is illusory,that this life is just a dream, and the only use you can make of this life is to find that which remains forever.\nNaturally, the East has remained poor. Nobody else is responsible for it. it was bound to happen. If I had been there at Buddha's time, I would have predicted that what he was teaching would result in poverty, sickness and death to the same people who were influenced by him. And remember, when people are poor, hungry, dying, do you think they can meditate? With a hungry stomach, can you go on sitting silently and let the grass grow by itself?\nBasho's stomach was full when he wrote those lines. He must have begged and eaten well. Then, sitting under a tree by the side of a pond, he could write beautiful poetry of tremendous significance. But we should not forget that Basho was not hungry. If he had been hungry, then there was no possibility of these beautiful lines coming out of him.\n\"The ancient pond, the frog jumps in. The sound.\" Or, the silence. It is difficult to translate exactly the Japanese word, because Japanese has no alphabet. In India, we have a word,which is pronounced \"chapak,\" -- the sound of the frog. When a frog jumps into the pond, there is something like chapak.\nBut these beautiful statements are not out of a hungry stomach. The East went on becoming poorer and poorer, because without technology and science you cannot be rich. And if Ethiopia is dying today -- almost one thousand people per day are dying, and in the last four years, millions have died in Ethiopia -- who is responsible for these people dying there? Why have they not been able to develop enough technology and science to create and produce wealth? Because wealth was condemned by their religious leaders and the people listened to their religious leaders. Wealth was condemned. Children were declared to be gifts of God, so they went on producing only one thing: children. Now, no child brings with him a piece of land, seeds for the new crop, water to nourish the plants. God goes on sending children without any equipment to be here, and the religious leaders go on saying they are gifts of God, but they have proved to be the very curses against humanity.\nThe East was bound to remain poor because of Gautam Buddha. It was bound to remain unprogressive, backward, because of Gautam Buddha. And I love the man; you can understand my anguish that I have to say that Gautam Buddha is\nresponsible for this whole misery. For twenty-five centuries, millions of people have suffered, have gone mad, have become perverted -- and the man who is responsible for it, I love him.\nI love Zorba, too, but I know it is because of the materialists we have suffered two world wars and now the third is impending to destroy the whole humanity at any moment. Because of Zorbas, the West has remained superficial. Yes, its stomach is full, perhaps much too full, but its being is empty. The house is really beautiful, a palace, but nobody lives there. It is empty. Yes, there are precious paintings on the walls and great sculptures in the garden. Everything is immensely valuable, but nobody lives there; nobody IS there, because the materialist forgot completely to come back home. He went out, and out, and out, and went on searching farther and farther away from his home base. Now he has completely forgotten who he is, where he comes from. Now he is asking, what is the meaning of my life, what I am searching, what I am going here, what the hell am I doing here? He is angry, angry at life itself.\nIn one of Dostoevsky's novels, THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV there are three brothers. One brother is an atheist, one brother is a very pious religious innocent person, and the third brother simply does not care about either. The atheist says: If I meet your God, Ivan -- Ivan is the religious one -- if I meet that fellow anywhere, the first thing I am to do is to return the ticket, and ask the gentleman, \"Is it right to send me into a world without asking my permission? Who are you? What authority have you got to force me to live a life which is meaningless? And everything that is joyful, you and your representatives condemn it. You have done a great job of creating. You create us without asking us. That is the first crime you have committed. Then you give us instincts which we have not asked for and send your prophets and messiahs who condemn those instincts saying that sex is sin, that attachment is sin, that possessions are sin. So what kind of game is going on? Are you some kind of a sadist? Have you created us to suffer? Are you enjoying our suffering and misery?\"\nThat brother is speaking for the whole West. Everything is available, but what is the point? You will go on making love to this woman, to that man, but what is the point? After a few experiences, you simply look silly. What are you doing? You may eat in this restaurant,in that restaurant -- Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian spaghetti -- but sooner or later you are bound to recognize what is going on. What is the point of it all? Why should I go on living tomorrow, because again tomorrow, spaghetti?\nIt is enough for any intelligent man -- and the more intelligent a man is, the sooner he gets bored. Retarded people can go on living with a woman or with a man their whole life. But intelligent people, the greater their intelligence, the greater is their capacity to see that there are thousand of beautiful women. Why remain with one? There are thousands of beautiful men, so why cling to one? There is no natural law that you have to remain clinging to one. Why create a bondage?\nBut even if a man goes on moving from one woman to another, soon he gets tired and founds out that he is in a vicious circle. Finally he finds to his great surprise that all women are exactly the same. What you call making love -- whether you make love to Cleopatra or Mother Teresa -- it is the same, the same stupid thing. So the whole West has created the foundation of the temple, but a foundation is meaningless without a temple. They go on making foundations, and then they are stuck: \"What are we doing? For what are we making this foundation?\" They don't have any idea that a temple has to be created. They have denied that temple for centuries: there is no consciousness.\nKarl Marx says, \"Consciousness is only a by-product of matter.\" See the point: Shankara, Buddha and Mahavira say that matter is illusory, that consciousness is immortal reality. Charvaka, Epicurus, and Karl Marx say just the opposite, that matter is the ONLY reality and consciousness is only a by-product.\nIt is just like a clock on the wall that goes on clicking, giving you time. If you bring an aboriginal into the room and show the clock moving, he will look all around and say, \"Where is the spirit of the clock?\" Because if it moves, there must be a mover hidden inside. But there is no mover, the movement is a by product of a certain mechanism. You can take apart all the parts. Do you think the soul of the clock goes upwards to meet God? If it was a good clock, giving the right time all the time, it will go to God; if it was a bad clock, giving the wrong time all the time, it will go down into hell to suffer. But you know there is nobody who is going anywhere. You can put those parts together again, and the clock starts clicking. that clicking of the clock is just a by-product.\nThe West denied consciousness; the result is a tremendous feeling of despair. The East denied matter; the result is Ethiopia, India. Half a million people are going to die out of poverty this year. Two million people will be barely able to survive. You cannot tell them that being barely able to survive will be life.\nAnd who knows about the next year? Right now the world population is four billion. In every decade we are producing one billion people, so by the time this century ends, we will be nearabout six billion people. Our resources are being exhausted, and this increase of population will be happening in the poor countries,not in the rich countries. The poor countries will become poorer, much porer, and it will be impossible for richer countries to give any help. And why should they give? The poor don't give their meditation to the rich. They don't give their experiences of ecstasy, blissfulness to the rich. Why should the rich give the fruits of their technology to the poor? They are going to be in difficulty themselves, because they are piling up nuclear weapons.\nThis is where Zorba has brought them. Sooner or later nuclear weapons are going to destroy the world. Yes, they will die with their stomachs full. In fact, half a million people only in America suffer from obesity, fatness. They go on growing like monsters. They don't have anything else to do except eat. Eat more. A small child, an American, was puzzled why the Ethiopians go on dying. He told his father that it seems so stupid that one thousand people are dying every\nday, starving. Why don't they open their fridges? If there is nothing else available, they can eat cakes, biscuits.\nNow, the American child cannot conceive a home without a fridge. What a distance we have created amongst human beings! The Ethiopian has never seen a fridge and perhaps will never see one. There seems to be no way for Ethiopia to survive.\nZorba has brought half of the world to where they have everything. Only the man is missing, the spirit is missing -- and with the spirit, all meaning, all ecstasy, all joy, everything has gone down the drain. In the East, they are poor, dying, sick, suffering in every possible way, and that is the consequence of what Buddha has been teaching to these people.\nI want East and West to disappear into each other. I want Zorba and buddha to disappear into each other. Only then will we have a whole man, and the whole man is the need of the day. It is because of this that I am going to be condemned from both sides. The religious people will condemn me as a materialist; and the materialists, the communists are condemning me for diverting peoples' minds towards meditation. That means the young generation is being diverted away from the revolution, that I am serving in some way the interests of capitalism.\nI am the greatest danger to them, because I am attracting so many young people. If they had not come to me, they would be communists. But now the situation has come to such a point that red no longer represents the communists, it represents me.\nThey both are angry: Zorba is angry, Buddha is angry. But I am not to be stopped by either. I am going to put both of them into a mixture and put the electricity on, so that when the juice comes out, you cannot find which is Buddha and which is Zorba. That is my sannyasins: one who will live with intensity and totality like Zorba. But that is not the end, that is only the beginning. He will go on searching, seeking for something higher to live, something better to live. He will be in favor of science and technology. He will not deny this world. He will not call it a dream. It is true -- as true as anything can be. Who can say roots are untrue? Just to prove that roses are true, have you to prove roots to be illusory? I don't see the point. Roots are roots, and as roots they are real. Roses are roses; as roses, they are real. The problem is that they are joined together and they depend on each other.\nI have told you that juices are flowing continuously from the roots towards the flower; but it is not a one way affair. the flower is taking the sun rays deep down to the roots. Because those roots are underground, they also need the life that sun rays give. Without those sun rays, those roots wil die. The flower does not open for you to make a garland, it opens for the roots which are hidden. In fact, it is an extension, a hand of the roots to catch hold of life and energy from the sun, the wind, the rain,and send it back to the roots which are hidden deep down. It is a two way traffic.\nAnd this is how it should be between Zorba and Buddha. If Buddha has eyes -- and certainly he has eyes -- but he doesn't have legs, what is he going to do with his eyes? The house is on fire.He can see it. He can see the way out, but he doesn't have legs, he is crippled. And somebody is sitting by his side who is blind, but has strong legs.\nI am suggesting a simple thing: get introduced to each other! Tell each other what you have got and what you have not got. It is a simple thing to come to an understanding that the crippled man, who can see, sits on the shoulders of the strong man, who is blind but who can walk. Now they are together, functioning as one unit. One sees and shows the way, and the other follows -- that's the only way to get out of the house which is on fire.\nAnd we ARE in the house which is on fire. It is exactly the right moment when Zorba and Buddha should drop all their antagonism and become one.\nYes, Zorba is blind, but he is a strong person. Buddha has eyes, but he is fragile. He can sit under the bodhi tree, but if the jungle takes fire, perhaps he will not be able to escape.\nIt had happened in Buddha's life.… I have been to that place near Bodhgaya, where Buddha became enlightened. There is a small river, Niranjana. Buddha was so weak because of fasting, meditating. He had devoted everything to meditation. He had forgotten his body, he had forgotten everything else. He went to take a bath in Niranjana. It is a small river. When I went there, I could not believe -- perhaps at that time it may have been a little bigger river -- but the story is that he was so weak that the current of the river started carrying him away and he could not manage to stand against that small river's current. He tried hard somehow to get out, and had to hang onto the root of a tree on the side of the river. He had to rest for a time to gather energy enough to get out of the river.\nThis situation, this story, is the story of the whole East. Yes, Buddha has got eyes. He can see as far as existence is. His vision is limitless but he has done one thing wrong: he has gone against the body, against nature. His achievement is partial. So is the achievement of Zorba partial.\nRemember one thing: truth can only be the whole. It is just like a circle. You cannot draw half a circle. That is not possible. Just the word circle means FULL- CIRCLE. You cannot draw half a circle. That will be only an arc, not a circle. A circle has to be whole. And that's the situation about truth: truth has to be whole. Half a truth is worse than a lie.\nBuddha is half of the truth, and Zorba is half of the truth. It is going to be difficult to explain to Buddhist that I am making an effort to create a synthesis between Zorba and Buddha. They may feel offended, but that does not matter. Truth is on my side, and I am ready for an open discussion with both Buddha and Zorba. And my vision is so clear that both are half and both have disturbed the whole humanity.\nNow it is time for Zorba the Buddha to appear. Perhaps I am the first Zorba the Buddha. I take the responsibility of bringing this new kind of animal into the world. And my sannyasins have to be Zorba the Buddha. Nothing has to be sacrificed, and everything has to be experienced. From body to soul, from earth to sky, all is ours.\nQ:* THE PROBLEMS OF SOUTH AFRICA ARE BASICALLY REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS JAPANESE. WE ARE ACCEPTABLE IN BUSINESS, BUT CULTURALLY WE ARE CONSIDERED COLORED AND HAVE SEMI-HUMAN STATUS. IS THERE ANY SOLUTION POSSIBLE IN SOUTH AFRICA?\nA:* South Africa is not a big problem. Like all problems it is very simple, but the vested interests make everything complex. In South Africa only fifteen percent of the population is white, and these fifteen percent white are invaders. Eighty-five percent of the people, the natives of the land, have been living in slavery for centuries. They are simply slaves, servants, working in the coal mines, gold mines, diamond mines. Those mines belong to them, but they get only a little bit of money to survive. And the fifteen percent white people exploit their rich country, and have been doing so for three hundred years.\nNow it has come to the point where something has to be done, but the problem is that these fifteen percent whites came three hundred years ago, and now they don't have anywhere to go. There are Dutch people, English people, Italians. There are others, but the majority is Dutch. Their own countries are not ready to accept them back, because no country wants its population to grow suddenly. Somehow they are keeping things in balance. Neither do these people really want to go back, because in their own countries they will be ordinary second-rate citizens. Maybe clerks, waiters, porters, while in South Africa, they are kings. All their investment is in South Africa. All the technology that they have brought, all the mechanism is in the mines of South Africa, and they know how much more is still there to be exploited. They have only scratched the surface. This is their greed and their fear of going back to their own countries where they will be almost foreigners.\nThey have started calling themselves Afrikaaner, they don't call themselves Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish. No, they have become a new race: Afrikaaner, and they call their language Afrikaans. They don't want to leave and I can understand the human greed. I can also understand their problem of who is going to accept them. Nobody is willing to accept them, but that does not mean they have to continue to exploit eighty-five percent of the people, their country, their land; nor that they have to go on being the ruling ones.\nIt is strange that in the twentieth century only the fifteen percent, the white people, have the voting right in South Africa. The eighty-five percent majority\nhas no voting right, so the question of their coming into power does not arise. They have nothing to do with power. They can't even vote. It is inhuman.\nI can see the difficulty of the white people; I can see the exploitation of the black people, but it cannot continue the way it has up to now. It has come to a point of explosion. Now there is emergency rule. The whole country is under military rule, and South Africa has one of the biggest armies in the world. No journalist is allowed in, so nobody knows how many people are being killed and burned every day.\nMy suggestion is simple: fifteen percent of the land should become a new country -- Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the wealth should go to the new country, Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the army should go to the new country, Afrikaaner. Everything according to the percentage, with South Africa divided into two countries, Afrikaaner and South Africa.\nIt is so simple, if people really want to solve the problem. The white people should remain there. They have been there for three hundred years, and their old countries are not going to accept them back. It is enough time. But they should get according to their percentage. if they don't want to divide the country, then the eighty-five percent majority should be given the voting right. Naturally then the government will be of native South Africans.\nThese are two clear alternatives. And I think the white people will prefer the first. They would have at least fifteen percent of the country -- fifteen percent of its wealth, diamond mines, gold mines, and fifteen percent of the army -- and they would be their own rulers. And the native eighty-five percent of the people would have eighty-five percent of the army, eighty-five percent of the wealth, eighty-five percent of the land, and would be their own kings. I don't see a problem at all. They just have to sit with each other and find out the way to divide.\nIf the ruling minority insist that they don't want division, then they must give the eighty-five percent majority their voting rights. But then they will not have even the fifteen percent that was possible in the first place, because the native majority will throw them out of the government. Then they will be at the natives' service. Those natives who have served you for three hundred years -- now you serve them. they have worked in your mines and died -- now you work and die.\nThe whole world should insist that either of these two alternatives has to be accepted; otherwise, the South African government simply will be rejected by all the governments of the world. They should be thrown out of UNO. They have no right to represent a country where eighty-five percent of the people are against them. They should not be given any support. All businesses from other countries should be completely stopped. The present government should be forced either to accept the first conclusion, or accept the second alternative.\nAnd I think the first is perfectly beautiful. They don't lose; they get as much as they deserve, fifteen percent. The native South Africans don't lose anything, they get as much as they deserve. One just needs the clarity to see. But this is the\nproblem: even when things are very simple, millions of people have to die, innocent people have to suffer. The idiotic politicians and power-hungry people go on massacring poor innocent children, women, old people.\nIn South Africa the army now is given the power to shoot anybody they suspect. No inquiry is needed; no arrest warrant is needed; no court has to decide. The military itself has all the powers to shoot ANYBODY, and suspicion is not something that you can later prove wrong or right. Whether it was wrong or right, it makes no difference -- it was not a certainty, it was only a suspicion. So now they are killing anybody they want to kill. It is the responsibility of the whole world to reject South Africa as a member of civilized humanity, because what they are doing is barbarous.\nBut even countries like America that are supposed to be the most advanced, progressive, democratic countries do things which are inconceivable. In the Second World War, when Japanese armies attached Pearl Harbor, one and one- half million Japanese -- who were living in America, who were American citizens, who had been living here for generations, and most of whom were born in America -- were given fifteen days notice to sell their properties, land, everything, and move to a special place that the American government was providing for them.\nAnd the whole of America was kept in darkness. Even today that part is not mentioned in books of history about the Second World War.\nIn fact, all around the world, nobody knows what actually happened to those one and one-half million Japanese-Americans. Fifteen days was such a short notice -- how could you sell your businesses, your houses, your lands? -- and who is going to purchase them when the local buyers knew that within fifteen days you will have to go, that the lands, the buildings, your car, your shop, your business, everything will be left in their hands, free? Why purchase?\nThese one and one-half million Japanese-Americans who had earned all this with their own labor with their own intelligence, were really rich people. The Japanese have the knack of becoming rich; they know how to create wealth.\nThey had to leave, and they were not supposed to ask why or where they were going. Just one thing was told to them -- that the American government suspected that when America and Japan were at war they might favor Japan. And in a democratic country, the government had not a single proof that a single Japanese in America supported Japan. Out of one and one-half million people, they could not find a single proof that anyone was really or willing to support Japan.\nThey were ready to support and fight for America because they considered America their country; but they were taken into isolation in the desert where they were told that they would be taken care of on a reservation, just like the Red Indians. But it was not a reservation. Now facts have become available: it was the same kind of concentration camp that Adolf Hitler had created in Germany for Jews.\nAfter the Second World War, the people who had been running those concentration camps in Germany were punished, but America was not punished even though they had behaved in the same way with absolutely innocent Japanese-Americans who were not in favor of Japan. They were tortured, no medical facilities were given, their food was not up to standard, and they were crushed like sub-human beings.\nWhen they were brought back after the war, their properties were not returned, and have not been returned even yet. And this is a democracy! During the whole period of wartime, America was not able to find any proof to support their actions. When the Japanese-Americans were released, their businesses were in American hands, their cars were in American hands, Americans had taken over everything without giving a single paise in compensation.\nNow forty years have passed and those Japanese-Americans are still asking the American government: \"Give us some compensation. It was your duty.You forced us and we had not committed any crime, and you don't have a single case against us.\" And it is not a small thing -- one and a half million people and their properties -- and the American government is silent.\nThat's why I say that civilization has yet to come. It has not yet happened. There are only pretenders, hypocrites, but not truly democratic people anywhere. America is different from the Soviet Union only in hypocrisy. The Soviet Union is straightforward, a dictatorship. America IS a dictatorship proclaiming itself as a democracy, and now we can say it from our own experience.\nFor four years, Rajneeshees have been harassed by the American government -- the state government, the federal government -- without any legal reason on their part to support their acts against us. All their laws are in our favor and their constitution is in our favor, because from the very beginning I have made it clear to my people not to do anything knowingly or unknowingly against the American constitution; that it is the only constitution which at least accepts democracy, accepts freedom of speech, accepts respect for the individual -- so don't do anything.\nWe have not done anything against the constitution, but still we are being harassed in every possible way. They are taking advantage of all kinds of laws, which have never been applied to anyone in the whole history of America. Suddenly those laws have become applicable to us, and those laws go against the American constitution. So now my new stand is that we will fight the American government in Oregon, and if needed, then the federal government, to save the American constitution. We are for the American constitution and its values, and even if we have to fight with the Americans themselves, we will fight to the very end -- because that constitution is the only hope for humanity some day to become democratic, some day to become really civilized and human. Okay, Nartan?\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #23 Chapter title: None 9 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH NATHAN WOOD, THE ROGERS CABLE SYSTEM, PORTLAND, OREGON\nQUESTION:* YOU LOOK VERY NICE IN BLUE. IS THAT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE COLORS?\nANSWER:* All colors are my favorites, except red. Q:* DO YOU SEE A LOT OF RED AROUND HERE?\nA:* Your tie!. That is a lot.\nQ:* WHY DO THESE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SO MUCH? WHY ARE YOU SO APPEALING?\nA:* I am also wondering.\nQ:* IS IT THE BEARD OR THE MONEY OR THE PRESTIGE?\nA:* I don't have any money. I don't have any prestige. I am notorious all over the world. What prestige can I have? To be with me needs courage. To be with a notorious man... you will lose your prestige if you are with me.\nQ:* WHY IS THAT?\nA:* Because I am notorious. You need not do anything; you just be with me and you will lose your prestige, your respectability, your service. Everything will be gone.\nThey love me because I love them, and they cannot love me more than I love them. The love of all my sannyasins around the world is put on one side of a scale and my love for them on the other side, I'm going to be weightier.\nQ:* WHEN OR IF YOU DO PASS AWAY, OR IF YOU DIED, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED, WHO WOULD TAKE OVER? WOULD THERE BE SOMEONE TO TAKE OVER? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO RAJNEESHPURAM IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU?\nA:* Let me start from some point.… I have been waiting my whole life for somebody to ask it, but nobody asks me what will happen to me when I die. Nobody is worried about that.\nI will be dying and you will be living here. The whole trouble and the journey into the unknown is for me. Nobody seems to be concerned about that; everybody is concerned about those who will be left behind, living. What kind of minds have human beings got? Very egocentric. I am dying and even at my last breath you will be asking, \"What will happen to all these people who will be living?\" Nobody will ask, \"Bhagwan, forget all about us. We will be living and you are going on an unknown pilgrimage. What can we do for you?\"\nQ:* WHAT KIND OF A PILGRIMAGE WOULD YOU BE GOING ON WHEN YOU DIE?\nA:* Whatever kind of pilgrimage, when one is dying at least he is out of this world, out of this life, out of all that is known. He is moving into the dark and the unknown and the unfathomable. If you really love the person you will be concerned about him. But the trouble is that everybody is concerned about himself, although you will be living and I will be dying.\nQ:* WHAT COULD WE DO THEN? WHAT COULD WE THE LIVING DO TO HELP?\nA:* At least you could ask the question. But for my whole life I have been waiting and nobody has asked it. I am simply pointing at the fact of how egocentric man is. Now your question.…\nMy whole teaching is centered on the present moment, this moment. I do not care for any tomorrows. In the first place, the tomorrow never comes; whatever comes is always the now. You are never there, you are always here. Existence knows only two words, now and here.\nI have heard about an atheist who was very much against God. To remind himself and his clients, his children, his wife, his friends, he had written in his sitting room in big bold letter, \"God is nowhere.\"\nThen a child is born the the atheist, a small child. He starts growing and learning. Learning the alphabet, he reads the sentence, \"God is nowhere.\" But nowhere is such a big word for him that he splits the word in two. He reads, \"God is now here.\" That mistake transformed the whole mind of his father. For the first time he could see that nowhere consists of now and here.\nExistence is now and here. I have never bothered about the future. When I leave the body these people will celebrate, as we celebrate everything. And I have no responsibility for them, so the question of anybody succeeding me does not arise. The successor is needed only when I am having any responsibility. I have no responsibility. My approach is that everybody is responsible for his own life.\nIn this commune they are not here to dump their responsibility on me; they are here to learn how to stop dumping responsibility on others, how to take the whole responsibility of life on one's own shoulders. That's what gives a man dignity, integrity, self. For the first time he feels he is. And the responsibility makes him free of all kinds of slaveries, enslavements.\nSo, I'm not going to say what they have to do when I am gone. That is manipulating people even when you are dead. Moses is still manipulating the Jews. He was not satisfied while alive. While alive he tortured his people for forty years in the Middle East desert in search of some holy land.\nQ:* SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE BIBLE IS ACCURATE IN SPEAKING OF MOSES, OR IS THAT A MYTH?\nA:* The BIBLE is just fiction.\nQ:* YOU MENTIONED GOD JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU CONCEPT OF GOD IS. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKED THAT SO MANY TIMES, BUT.…\nA:* My concept is exactly whole because I can read nowhere; I don't have to cut words in two. God is nowhere.\nQ:* GOD IS NOWHERE. I WAS WONDERING THAT, BECAUSE WHEN...\nA:* No, wait, don't wonder, let me finish. Moses tortured Jews for forty years. Almost seventy-five percent of his followers died in that stupid search for a holy land. And finally, not because they had found the holy land, but just to save face, he declared Israel to be the holy land. Now there is nothing holy in Israel! And Moses gave commandments to them to be followed after he is gone. The same was done by Mohammed, by Buddha. They were too much concerned about what their people are going to do when they are gone.\nIt is something of tremendous importance that they were so much concerned. The reason is that in their presence they have persuaded the disciples to repress every natural instinct. Sex has to be repressed and they have to be celibate. Under their influence and charismatic personality people have accepted something absolutely unnatural. Only an impotent man can be celibate; and no impotent man has been known to become enlightened, not yet. He has no energy in him. Enlightenment will need a tremendous explosion of energy. He cannot\neven create a child; how can he create himself in a totally luminous way? So no impotent man has ever become enlightened.\nAnd all the people who became enlightened were really over-sexual. In fact their over-sexuality was one of the causes for their enlightenment. They had so much energy that the woman was not enough. Many women were also not enough. They had such a great energy that they wanted to make love to the whole existence itself, and that's what enlightenment is, and orgiastic experience with existence itself.\nQ:* ARE YOU ENLIGHTENED?\nA:* Yes.\nQ:* HOW ENLIGHTENED. ARE YOU VERY ENLIGHTENED?\nA:* There are no quantities in enlightenment; either you are enlightened or you are not enlightened.\nQ:* I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AS FAR AS OTHER RELIGIONS.…\nA:* No, I have not answered your first question. You asked me what I am thinking about these people after I am gone. I am not even thinking now, when I am here.\nI am giving them total freedom. I have not enforced anything on them that will make me afraid that once I am gone these celibates are going to create trouble. I have not repressed anything. If they want to smoke, I tell them to smoke the best cigar possible -- don't go for anything second rate. If you want to love, find out the best man, the best woman, and go into it as totally as possible. I am in support of expression and all the so-called religions were in support of repression. When you repress people you are certainly afraid that when you are gone there is going to be chaos.\nThat problem does not exist for me. When I am gone there is going to be no chaos because chaos was all that I have been training my people for. My commune is a chaos and yet a very organic chaos, a very creative chaos, a chaos out of which stars are born. That's why that kind of question becomes very difficult for me to answer. I am not giving them any discipline, any rules of conduct. I am simply teaching them to be aware, alert, to be independent. Take your responsibility and do whatsoever you want to do. Don't bother about Moses, or Jesus, or Buddha, or me.\nJesus lived his way; he never bothered about others. If he had bothered about others; the Jews would never have crucified him. Buddha never bothered about anybody. I don't accept anybody as my master or my leader. I am nobody's\nshadow, nobody's carbon copy, and that's what I am teaching to my people: Don't be anybody's carbon copy, including me.\nSo, alive, dance with me, rejoice with me. When I am gone continue to dance and rejoice in remembrance of a man who gave you freedom, who gave you individuality. What else is there to bother about the future? Wherever I am -- somewhere I must be -- I will go on showering my love on my people and I know they will find ways to respond. But that is something very private; I cannot reveal it to a non-sannyasin.\nQ:* YOU HAVE MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENT REMARKS ABOUT RELIGIONS, AND -- I BELIEVE THIS IS YOUR MOST RECENT ONE; YOU'LL CORRECT ME, I'M SURE YOU WILL -- THAT THIS IS THE TRUE RELIGION, THIS IS THE TRUE CHURCH. CORRECT?\nA:* Right.\nQ:* YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU WERE BUILDING AN ORCHESTRA OUT OF ALL THESE OTHER RELIGIONS. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT?\nA:* I have done it already. There is no question of proposition. You can see my commune, Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas.\nQ:* SO YOU WEREN'T SPEAKING OF THE WHOLE WORLD, THEN, YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING OF IN THE COMMUNE?\nA:* I am just speaking of my world. Hell to the whole world!\nQ:* YOU MADE A COMMENT A FEW YEARS BACK, I BELIEVE, THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD POPULATION WOULD DIE OF AIDS. NOW RECENTLY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE NEWS, THAT THE FIGURES ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR PREDICTION IS STARTING TO COME TRUE?\nA:* No need because they are going to die; there is no way to save them. Q:* HOW SOON DO YOU THINK?\nA:* Within the last twenty years before the twenty-first century, they are going to die either by nuclear weapons or by AIDS. The nuclear weapons are the culmination of our whole past politics. AIDS is the culmination of our whole religious past.\nAIDS is the logical conclusion of all sexual perversions; and religions have caused all kinds of perversions in man. Homosexuality is a very religious\ndiscipline. Monks were forced to live together in monasteries where no woman was allowed to enter. There is a Catholic monastery in Athos, one thousand years old. In these one thousand years not even a six-month-old baby girl has entered the monastery. Even that is not allowed. I sometimes wonder -- a six-month-old baby girl -- what is the fear and what kind of monks are living inside? Are they monks or monsters? And in Athos the rule is that once you enter the monastery only your dead body comes out. You will never come out alive to have any contact with other human beings. There are nunneries where only women can live; no men can enter. Now what do you want? You are creating the situation for homosexuality, lesbianism, masturbation and all kinds of things. These monks, these nuns are the original sources of AIDS.\nSo your politics have brought you to the third world war, which is looming on the horizon, and your religions have brought you to AIDS. Your political and religious leaders have done great service to humanity and to this planet.\nI am certainly concerned about my people. They have been given all the information about AIDS. Meanwhile, the governments are trying to repress exact information for the simple reason that if they accept that AIDS is spreading, if may create anarchy, chaos, turmoil. Rich people can afford private doctors, private physicians, and they can keep their mouths shut with their dollars. There are many people who have AIDS; they are confirmed by the medical profession but the public does not know about them.\nJust think of the situation. A person who has AIDS can live at the most two years, at the most, which is almost impossible. If he remains secluded, avoids all kinds of infections, does not come in contact with anybody, perhaps he may survive two years; otherwise, six months is going to be the average. Just think, you are given six months to live. You would not like to be condemned by people that you have AIDS. You bribe the doctor. And you have only six months to live, naturally you will make as many sexual contacts as possible. Life is fleeing out of your hands. You would like to do everything that you always wanted to do but you had time to postpone. Now there is no time to postpone, so these people who are not made known to the public are going around spreading AIDS like wildfire.\nQ:* SO YOU DON'T THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING ENOUGH TO CONTROL AIDS, THEN?\nA:* Not at all. They are doing nothing. Their senators have AIDS and they have not yet imprisoned those senators. Their senators are homosexuals; they should be immediately arrested. There is no other way: put them into imprisonment.\nQ:* WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH A SANNYASIN IF HE OR SHE HAD AIDS?\nA:* There is no need because my sannyasins are living in a totally different world. I have one million sannyasins around the world and I am trying for them all to come and live in communes, not to live in the outside world. So I am segregating them into different places, into different countries, in communes. We do not condemn anything; every sannyasin goes through the medical test and if he finds that he has AIDS the whole commune is full of compassion for the person.\nQ:* ARE YOU TESTING FOR AIDS, THEN?\nA:* Yes, we have our own medical center, all kinds of expertise: doctors, nurses, a hospital. And we have a special place far away in the mountains where we remove those people who have AIDS. We take care of them. We give them everything they need, books to read, films to see, games to play. They are respected in the commune, and everybody is responsible that they are no longer to make any sexual contact. Not even kissing, because AIDS is caught through kissing.\nSo I'm telling my sannyasins to change their patterns and drop the idea of kissing which is certainly unhygienic even without AIDS. Two persons mixing their saliva which contains all kinds of germs. And there are idiots who are doing French kissing. I have suggested that my sannyasins change that pattern: start rubbing noses with each other. Hygienic, clean, and if sometimes somebody has a cold, at the most you can catch cold. And this is not a big problem. Nobody considers a cold a disease. If you don't take medicine it goes in seven days; if you take medicine it goes in one week. And this is not something new; Eskimos have been doing it for their whole history. They don't kiss, they rub their noses and they enjoy rubbing their noses. As much as you want, you can rub. There is no problem and I think Eskimos are far more progressive, at lest about kissing. There are other aboriginal tribes also, in India, where noses are rubbed and kissing is simply laughed at.\nWhen Christian missionaries reached those aboriginal tribes to spread Christianity, the aboriginals have not stopped laughing yet about two things. One they call the missionary posture, man on top of the woman, which looked very ugly to the aboriginal. The woman is fragile, delicate, she should be on top. And this huge animal is putting all his weight and doing push-ups on the poor woman. In India this posture is called missionary posture because they came to know about it for the first time through Christian missionaries. Otherwise in India there are known eighty-four different postures and in those eighty-four different postures the Christian missionary posture is not included. And second thing that they could not believe is that these people kiss. And these people are trying to open hospitals, medicine -- can't they understand what they are doing, that this is very unhygienic?\nThe aboriginals who are five thousand years behind the civilization have never agreed for kissing. Even though they had become Christians -- they were poor and Christians could provide them with food, clothes, education -- they have not started kissing. They still rub noses.\nSo, as far as my sannyasins are concerned, perhaps they will be the only ones who can escape the calamity of AIDS. We don't condemn anybody; if he has AIDS, so what? Take precautions. He is not humiliated and disrespected for that; on the other hand, he becomes the center of the love of the whole commune. Now we have two sannyasins who have confirmed AIDS. We are taking care of them and we have given them the most beautiful part of our land, the best beautiful view.\nQ:* ARE THEY HERE IN THIS COMMUNE?\nA:* Yes, they are here in this commune, but we have one hundred twenty-six square miles, so they are miles away, beyond the lake, living in a beautiful place and doing whatsoever they can do. They can do proof-reading, they can do editing or whatever they want. They can simply make a beautiful garden there. And if both those two sannyasins want to make love to each other there is no problem. Nothing more can happen to them; what has to happen has happened. Perhaps two persons having AIDS making love may come to discover this is the only way to get rid of the disease -- nobody knows. So we may be able to find out: if they survive more than two years that means we have found what medical science has failed to find. But we will be taking care of these people. They are victims of religions, but what they can do?\nIf the politicians and the religious leaders -- that means nuclear weapons and AIDS -- are in a race to destroy humanity, I don't think politicians have guts enough to go for a third world war, because both sides, America and the Soviet Union, have enough nuclear weapons to destroy this planet seven hundred times. I don't think any politician in America or any politician in Russia has guts enough -- and what is the point?\nThe whole point in a war is to be victorious, but in this war nobody is going to be left alive. The question of who was victorious and who was defeated will remain unsettled and there will be no one to write the history, either. Just because of the totality of war, war is an impossibility. There is no need for pacifists, unnecessary to scream and take protest march. Just forget all about it; nuclear weapons have already done. They have finished the idea of war. Politicians can go on talking about war because that keeps them in power, but there is going to be no war.\nQ:* WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN YOUR OPINION IF A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY GOT HOLD OF A BOMB AND DETONATED IT AND STARTED ANOTHER WAR?\nA:* NOBODY can start it because everybody knows that starting it is finishing the whole humanity. And those poor countries who are dying.… Do you think Ethiopia is going to have nuclear weapons? Do you think India is going to have nuclear weapons? They are trying, but half of their population is on the verge of becoming another Ethiopia. They are selling their wheat. The people who have produced the wheat are dying because they are hungry, and their wheat -- their production, their labor -- is being exported so that India can manage to have a nuclear plant. Sheer stupidity. But even if they can get, nobody can conceive India becoming a nuclear power comparable to the Soviet Union or America.\nQ:* INDIA MAY NOT HAVE IT NOW AND IT MAY NOT BE A THREAT, BUT WHAT ABOUT CUBA OR LIBYA OR KHADAFI?\nA:* NOBODY. Even if they can afford, even if they can make, nobody has guts to start seeing the whole perspective. The whole thing is clear that if you start, that is not the end; soon you will be retaliated with nuclear missiles and you will be destroyed. And your starting it will mean the end of the world. So I don't think there is any possibility of third world war. It is simply canceled. It is strange how things happen in history -- war goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and a point comes when it is to big, and you cannot manage to have it. War itself commits suicide, that's what the third world war is.\nOnce Albert Einstein was asked, \"Can you say something to us about the third world war?\" He said, \"I have no idea. If you want to know about the fourth world war I can say something.\" The inquirer was simply at a loss. He could not believe what Einstein was saying. \"About the third world war you cannot say anything? What can you say about the fourth world war?\" And Einstein said, \"It will never happen; that much can be said about it. But about the third world war there is no way to say anything.\"\nSo the war is certainly canceled -- nuclear war. Any other kinds of war can go on. They are just football games, so I'm not concerned about that. But AIDS is certainly my concern because it is spreading, individual to individual.\nNo government control is possible. Even your president, your prime ministers may be having it. Nobody knows unless everybody is checked. You should begin with President Ronald Reagan -- that is the place to start with -- the White House should be completely checked because this White House is just like white lies. What is going on inside it is all black. In Oregon catch hold of Governor Atiyeh and start checking from there. First all your assembly members, your senators; first do it on the highest level because these are the people who can keep it to themselves and go on spreading. And then by and by come lower and lower, and find out people, then these people have to be segregated someplace.\nIt is such an urgency it cannot be delayed. And the whole humanity has to be made aware of all the facts relating to AIDS, all precautions that are possible. And around the world create the atmosphere that if anybody has AIDS he is\nsimply a victim of centuries of stupid religious ideas. Don't be hard on him. Help him so at least in these last days of his life, he can relax. There is no need for him to be employed, no need for him to think of other responsibilities. Free him from all responsibilities. Let him enjoy music, movies, literature. Be compassionate to him.\nI don't think your world is going to do it, but my communes are doing it already.\nQ:* NOW YOU'VE MADE A POINT IN THE PAST THAT YOU HAVE A VERY OPEN SEXUAL COMMUNE HERE. HOW DOES THAT EFFECT THE CHILDREN IN REGARDS TO CHILDREN ON THE OUTSIDE? ARE THEY BEING EXPOSED TO SEX AT AN EARLIER AGE? HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES?\nA:* There is no problem at all. Children are told everything about sex not in any roundabout way of explaining, but direct and exact. And once their curiosity is satisfied they don't bother about it; they will bother only when they are sexually mature. In the outside society they become interested before their sexual maturity because they see in the movies, they see in the streets, they see in their parents, and they wonder what is going on.\nA child is very curious to know about everything that he comes access, and you create all kinds of curiosities. He knows his father is reading magazines like PLAYBOY, and he also looks into the magazines when the father is in the bathroom. He knows his mother is frittering with somebody else. Children are very conscious, very alert, silent, but watching everything that is going on around them. Naturally he becomes curious -- something is being kept secret from him. -- and this curiosity is dangerous; he may try to do something that others are doing. It must be really great because everybody is doing it, every movie, every family. All the children are talking about it, so there must be something really experienceable.\nBut in my commune it is totally different. We tell our children everything. We tell them they are allowed to ask all the question, that there is nothing to hide, there is no secret. And we tell them that soon they will become mature, soon they will be having sexual experiences, so it is better to be acquainted with all the facts about sexuality as well as all the fictions which are all untrue but have been told to children down the ages. So we are making them aware of the facts and the fictions. Then, when they are sexually mature, we do no not prevent them from having sexual affairs. We simply introduce them to precautions; that is their responsibility. If a girl becomes pregnant she becomes a burden on the boy she loves and she becomes burdened by her own act, so we provide to them all birth control methods. In every bathroom we have free birth control methods available. They can go to the medical center and get the pill. We help them in every way.\nWe don't want them to remain celibate because celibacy is cause of AIDS. We want them to know as many girls, as many boys as possible. The richer their experience the better for choosing a life partner later. If a boy has known hundreds of girls he is more experienced and more capable of finding the right girl with whom he can manage to live. There will be less nagging, less fighting, less jealousy because the girl has also experienced hundreds of boys before she decided for this boy. The boy had experienced hundreds of girls before he decided for this girl. They both know.\nAnd in my commune it is absolutely allowed even after marriage that if the girl wants to go with someone for a day or two, or the husband wants to go with someone, it should be respected. It is their freedom. Once in a while a little change is good, and it is not destructive of marriage. On the contrary, it helps the people to remain together. Their love becomes more and more a friendship. In the ordinary world people are together but their love becomes more and more an intimate enmity. Here, their togetherness becomes more and more a friendship, and any day they want to change their partners that is their freedom, their choice. So nobody is crying and weeping and screaming. If you hear anybody screaming, crying, you should know that he is doing Dynamic Meditation; it is not the ordinary screaming that goes on in every other household. And we give them one hour every morning to scream as much as they can, so for twenty-three hours there is no need. We are absolutely simple and natural.\nIn the four years we have been here not a single child has been born. People understand their responsibility. We are the only people in the whole world who understand responsibility. Right now the world population is four billion and it is increasing at the rate of one billion per decade. By the end of this century there is not going to be elbow room -- on both sides you will find somebody standing. What are your governments doing and what are your churches doing? Four sannyasins have certainly died in our commune but not a new child has been born. And we are not going to give birth to children till the world population is reduced to one fourth.\nQ:* ONE FOURTH OF WHAT IT IS TODAY?\nA:* What it is today. Without coming to one fourth there will be Ethiopias, there will be Indias, there will be small-scale wars. These are just methods of nature to bring balance. Nuclear war is out of the question; there will be diseases, AIDS and everything, just to cut the population.\nBut my commune is perfectly responsible, happy, rejoicing. It is not that anybody is controlling them; we only inform them that these are the facts -- now they are intelligent enough to draw the conclusions. And my communes certainly are intelligent enough. Almost everybody is a graduate. Most of the people have masters degrees, a few have Ph.D.'s, a few are D.Litt.'s. And they come from all professions: psychiatrists, professors, doctors, engineers, electronic experts,\ncomputer experts. We are absolutely self-sufficient. And that's what we are doing around the world. We are trying to make every commune self-sufficient.\nIf the outside world dies of AIDS or anything we can still survive and we can manage humanity's heritage. The planet need not die with the popes and with the presidents and the prime ministers. It can live, go on living with dancing and celebrating sannyasins. But we are not serious about anything. This, too, is not a serious affair. We do everything playfully.\nQ:* I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION TO ASK YOU. WHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY FOR YOU? WHAT DO YOU DO FIRST IN THE MORNING? HOW DO YOU START YOUR DAYS?\nA:* First, I'm an absolutely lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's guide to enlightenment, so I am a non-doer. In the morning I have to be awakened otherwise I'm not going to wake up. At six o'clock they wake my up, and then I take one and a half hours in my bathroom relaxing in my bath. I love my bathroom the best; it is my temple. They have made for me really beautiful, gorgeous bathrooms. And not only one because I'm always for two of everything, not less than that, because if something goes wrong in one bathroom I'm not going to miss my bath. A second bathroom has to be constantly alert and ready. So for one and a half hours I enjoy in my bathroom. I have the best bubble baths. I'm allergic to perfumes, so I can take only herbal bubble baths. If you come to my bathroom you will be surprised to see what a treasure I have got there: the world's best shampoos, hair conditioners, liquid soaps without perfume, all kinds. It is really difficult every day for me to choose. It takes my\nalmost five minutes to figure out what this combination will do.\nAfter my one and a half hours I take one glass of juice; that is my whole breakfast. And then I go for my morning talk, two and a half hours gossiping with my sannyasins. I don't have any gospel I have only gossips, and I laugh with them, enjoy with them. By eleven I'm back. Eleven is my time for my lunch. and has been for my whole life. I have never missed my lunch at eleven. At eleven-thirty I go to sleep. That, too, I have never missed.\nI have always slept from eleven till two for the simple reason that if you sleep in the day for one or two hours, you have two mornings instead of one. And why miss the other? And sleeping is just a beautiful activity. Patanjali, the founder of yoga, has described the ultimate state of consciousness as very similar to deep sleep. The only difference is that in the ultimate state of consciousness -- what he calls samadhi -- one is aware; in deep sleep one is not aware. For me now there is no difference: my sleep is my samadhi. I am aware, so I am enjoying my sleep in a double way. Patanjali, Buddha, Mahavira, all those great Indian founders of religion missed something that I am enjoying -- they missed the afternoon nap.\nThey could not sleep because all these so-called great prophets and messiahs were fulfilling the expectations of mediocre people who were their followers.\nNow it doesn't look right for a Buddha to sleep in the day -- it looks lazy, it looks luxurious. And Buddha had not guts enough to say to those followers, that \"If you cannot accept me as having an afternoon nap, then just get lost. Just to fulfill your expectations, I am not going to change myself.\"\nMany times many people have told me that a religious man, particularly in India, should wake up at three o'clock in the morning. That is the traditional Indian spirituality, three o'clock in the morning. I said, \"I am ready to lose my enlightenment, my religiousness and everything, but forget completely that I am going to wake up at three o'clock in the morning. That is the best time to sleep; the most precious time is between three and five -- those two hours are the deepest. It is a scientific fact, but I have known it according to my own experience that those two hours are the most important because you go deeper. And I am fully conscious, so I can see when I go deep. Now science has come to support it. They have found a way -- your temperature falls down when you go deeper into sleep. Between three and five, your temperature comes. down; otherwise for twenty-two hours it remains the same, normal. For two hours, it suddenly falls down. So I enjoy my afternoon sleep.\nThen at two o'clock I have to be awakened again. I go for a drive that I have always loved, and my sannyasins have made a beautiful road just for me. Perhaps I am the poorest and the richest man in the world: I don't possess anything, but everything that anybody can possess, I use it. I don't think even the Queen of England has a private road going into the forest in the hills by the side of a lake. It is used only for one hour, and there is no traffic, so there is no question of following any stupid laws of being on the right or being on the left. Mostly I follow being in the middle, which is not allowed anywhere else in the world. That's why I enjoy it.\nBack at three o'clock, I rest just sitting in my chair. I have a beautiful haiku from a Japanese poet which says: Sitting silently, doing nothing, and the grass grows by itself. That's all -- haikus are very small statements, but of tremendous meaning. So for one and a half hours, I am just sitting silently, doing nothing, and let the grass grow itself. And it is growing. My grass is not green, it is red. And it is growing all around the world while I am simply sitting in my room, doing nothing. Even Basho was not aware -- he was thinking only of the grass by his side in the Zen garden where he was silently sitting. My grass is growing all over the world and I am not doing anything for it. But one and a half hours I enjoy sitting; then again for one and a half hours, I am back in my bathroom for my evening shower. Then I have my supper, and from the supper I come directly here for the interviews. By nine, nine-fifteen, I will be back. Then my personal secretary has one or two hours -- whatsoever she needs -- for any advice for the commune around the world, any letters to be answered. Mostly, they do them themselves, unless they find something that needs my advice; then they bring it to me. At eleven in the night, all my life I have eaten a certain kind of Indian sweet that I eat and go to bed. Without eating my sweet, I cannot sleep.\nQ:* WHAT KIND OF A SWEET IS IT?\nA:* It is a Bengali sweet which is not known in the West, but is the best. It is made of milk but the butter is taken out. You heat the milk and just pour lemon juice into the boiling milk. It separates, and what is left is called *** (name of sweet).\nIt is something that the West has not used. It is the lightest sweet. In Bengal it is given to patients or to those who are recovering from a long sickness. It is very helpful and tremendously delicious. From eleven to six, I am again knocked out. And it existence wants me again tomorrow, I will be awakened; otherwise I am gone -- gone with the wind.\nMy life is very simple -- the same. For thirty-five years it has been the same. I never got bored by it for the simple reason that I never compare two days. If you go on giving me the same food for a whole year, I will not complain because I don't compare. Yesterday is gone, finished. I again enjoy the same food with the same freshness, with the same excitement, with the same enlightenment as I have always done. My people go on doing everything for me. You see this beautiful robe? You were impressed by the colors -- my people make my robes, my people make my shoes, my people make my watches. Everything that I have on is made by my people. That's why I say everything that I am wearing is priceless because it is made of love. If somebody is going to give me a billion dollars for this watch, I am not going to sell it. There is no price which can purchase this watch because it has been made by my sannyasins with so much love and so much care. And these are not diamonds -- and that's why I loved it even more -- these are real stones, defeating diamonds.\nI have always enjoyed whenever a stone defeats a diamond, whenever a genius comes out from the lower classes and defeats all the super-rich. And it has been always so -- all the geniuses have come from lower classes. The super-rich have been absolutely impotent; they have not contributed to civilization in any way. They have not given birth to a single Picasso, a single Dostoevski, a single Turgenev, Gorky, Marx, Albert Einstein... they are just futile, getting fat.\nIn America there are half a million people suffering from over eating, obesity; and this year exactly half a million people in the third world are going to die of hunger. It is a strange world we have created in which half a million people are dying because they have no food, and the other half-million are dying because they are eating too much. Their fridges are so full.\nI have heard a story of a man whose wife was becoming bigger and bigger, fatter and fatter and was looking so ugly that to go with her in the society was just a shame. So he brought a beautiful picture of a nude girl, well-proportioned, and put that picture inside the fridge, where his wife was continuously going to give an idea what a woman should be like. But the trouble changed: the man started going to the fridge to look at the girl! The wife stopped; she hated to see that girl.\nShe would have killed that girl. She stopped going to the fridge and she started getting slimmer. But the husband started going to look at the girl and while looking at the girl, he would get interested in the ice cream and this and that. Soon the situation changed -- the wife was slim and the husband was ashamed to go with her in the outside society.\nBut this is what is happening around the world. A few people are dying because they have too much; a few people are dying because they have nothing. Just a little understanding, and we can create a beautiful humanity and a beautiful world where nobody needs to die, where nobody needs to suffer from AIDS. All that you have to do is to change stupid ideas and make man a natural human being, and allow his humanity and nature total freedom.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #24 Chapter title: None 10 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH MARCEL BRUYNS TROS NATIONAL TV, THE NETHERLANDS\nQ:* BHAGWAN, ABOUT YOUR HEALTH. HOW ARE YOU DOING?\nA:* Just great.\nQ:* YOUR DISCIPLES LAUGHING IN THE BACKGROUND, WHY DO YOU THINK THEY LAUGH?\nA:* Just my presence is enough for them to laugh, rejoice, sing, dance. I am here.\nQ:* HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE MASTER OF HALF A MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD?\nA:* Groovy.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK UP AGAIN?\nA:* Because the world is at a very great crisis. The politicians have brought the world to the ultimate destruction of this beautiful planet. It has to be stopped.\nQ:* HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?\nA:* Just by spreading my red people around the earth; creating more and more silence, peace, meditativeness; destroying people's old programs of being American, Russian, Indian, Dutch, German; destroying their old ideas of being Mohammedan, Christian, Jew, Hindu. Because this whole earth is ours, all the boundary lines of nations should disappear. Only then there is a guarantee there is not going to be a war in the future. I am for one world, one government. if nations are there, then war is inevitable.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, RECENTLY YOU MADE AN ATTACK ON THE CHURCHES AND ON MOTHER TERESA CALLING HER A CRIMINAL AND BLAMING HER FOR THE POVERTY AND THE ANGUISH IN THE THIRD WORLD. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS GOD-GIVEN?\nA:* There is no God.\nQ: WHAT DO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE IN, THEN?\nA:* Their beliefs are blind; the very word belief means blind. If you know, you know; you do not believe. You don't believe in the sun, in the moon. You don't believe in the roses, in the trees. You believe in God. You believe in heaven. You believe in hell. Those are all fictions.\nQ:* ARE YOU A GOD?\nA:* No.\nQ:* ... OR A MAN? YOU ARE A MAN?\nA:* I am just an ordinary man.\nQ:* BUT YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED.\nA:* That is not much of a difference. It is just a difference between closed eyes and open eyes.\nQ:* YOU BELIEVE IN POLYGAMY, BUT YOU ARE AFRAID OF OVER- POPULATION. YOU BELIEVE IN FREE SEX, AND YOU ARE AFRAID OF AIDS. HOW CAN YOU PROPAGATE POLYGAMY AND FREE SEX WITHOUT PROTECTING YOUR FOLLOWERS FROM AIDS?\nA:* I am protecting them already; there is no question of how. First, I am not in favor of polygamy as against monogamy. I am in favor of dissolving the very institution of marriage. That is the ugliest institution that has happened to man. Marriage dissolved, there is no question of monogamy or polygamy. People are free: if they want to be together, they are together; if they don't want to be together, that is their decision. And children should be taken care of by the commune. Children should not belong to families, but to the commune. And I am taking perfect care of my people. In four years not a single child has been born in this commune.\nQ:* WE KNOW BHAGWAN, THAT YOU ARE LIVING A RATHER RICH LIFE. BUT DO YOU THINK THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR THE POOR?\nA:* Those who are poor are themselves responsible for their poverty. They have believed in idiotic religious ideologies which have made them remain poor.\nQ:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP THEM?\nA:* They have to suffer whatsoever they have done. And if they have to punish someone, they should punish the Pope, Mother Teresa, Shankaracharya, Ayatollah Khomeini. Hang all of them: these are the people who are against birth control, against the pill, against abortion. These are the people who are increasing the population. The Pope increases the population and I am responsible for it? And those poor people listen to the Pope, not to me, so what I have to do with them?\nQ:* IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU THAT YOU ARE INSULTING MAYBE HALF THE WORLD BY SAYING THIS?\nA:* I want the world population to be reduced to one fourth. Only then can this world be comfortable, luxurious; can people live, enjoy, rejoice, create. Life can be a blessing. With this population it is a nightmare, and the responsibility goes to your religious leaders. I am not going to suffer for their crime. Neither me nor my people. We are living in comfort, in luxury. And I believe in comfort and luxury. Man has the intelligence to create more comfort than nature is capable of giving, more luxury than nature has ever intended to offer. And man should use the opportunity. These poor people who are dying in Ethiopia, in India, or anywhere, have listened to the wrong people. Now they should take revenge. They should burn the Vatican; they should take over all the churches. I am not responsible for their poverty. For thirty years I have been teaching birth control methods, abortion. And the poor people whom I have been teaching these things have been throwing stones at me, have been throwing shoes at me, have made attempts on my life. Strange reward -- I am trying to show them how to prevent becoming more and more poor, and they want to kill me. I am simply finished with all that nonsense. They should go to their Pope, to their Khomeini, to Shankaracharya and settle their things. i am concerned only with my red people and with nobody else.\nQ:* DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF YOUR MIND TO BECOME A SANNYASINS? YOU ONCE SAID THAT.\nA:* Certainly. There are two ways of being out of the mind. One is falling below it; then you go into an insane asylum. The other is going above it; then you\nbecome enlightened. But both are out of mind. Hence there is a certain similarity between the madman and the Buddha. A certain similarity.\nQ:* AREN'T YOU FREEZING?\nA:* No.\nQ:* IT IS COLD IN HERE.\nA:* I love freezing.\nQ:* BUT YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES ON.\nA:* They are not thicker than yours.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, RECENTLY THE POPE OF ROME PAID A VISIT TO THE NETHERLANDS. DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO COME THERE TO SEE HOW YOUR FIVE THOUSAND DUTCH FRIENDS ARE DOING?\nA:* No. I don't have any need to go anywhere. Q:* YOU LET THEM COME TO YOU.\nA:* They come here. Always the thirsty have to come to the well.\nQ:* BUT YOU ONCE CALLED HOLLAND YOUR MOST ORANGE COUNTRY, SO I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN OREGON?\nA:* In Oregon I am doing something else. In Holland, even without me, the country is going to turn red; but in America my presence is needed.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING ATTACKS ON RONALD REAGAN SEVERAL TIMES. I NEVER HEARD YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS.\nA:* I simply don't know anything about the Russian leaders -- except that I am against communism.\nQ:* BUT YOU DO KNOW ABOUT AFGHANISTAN AND THE RUSSIANS BEING THERE.\nA:* Yes, I have heard about it. But I don't read any books, any newspapers. I have dropped all rubbish. For five years I am just without any contact with the outside world.\nQ:* HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THEN?\nA:* Just my secretary. Q:* SHE TELLS YOU?\nA:* If she feels something has to be informed to me, she informs.\nQ:* AND SHE DIDN'T INFORM YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS DOING ALMOST THE SAME BUT THEM IN ANOTHER ANGLE AS THE WESTERN LEADERS?\nA:* She has never informed me about the Russian leaders. One thing I know is that they are not hypocrites; they are openly dictatorial. They believe in the dictatorship of the proletariat so whatsoever they do, they do it without hiding themselves behind beautiful words. America talks about democracy, but that is only talk.\nQ:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS PLANET, BHAGWAN? WILL THERE BE ANOTHER BHAGWAN?\nA:* I don't know, and neither do I care. When I was not here the world was not missing me.\nQ:* BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, YOUR SANNYASINS WILL MISS YOU WHEN YOU ARE GONE.\nA:* Only my sannyasins will miss me.\nQ:* SO WILL THERE BE ANOTHER MASTER?\nA:* No. Nobody can replace me; nobody can be my successor. I am making it absolutely clear that we are not to create another Christianity, another popedom, another Vatican. No. My sannyasins are related to me: Drink as much as you can from my well, and when my life disappears you are free to live the way you want. There is nobody going to dominate you, order you, discipline you. I am against all discipline, against all commandments. My whole emphasis is on the respect of the individual and his freedom. Even if he wants to go to hell, nobody\nshould interfere. So when I am gone, you see only from one side: when I die, you all have died to me.\nQ:* WE HEARD THIS STORY OF THE REVEREND JIM JONES WHO ORDERED HIS FOLLOWERS TO COMMIT SUICIDE. YOU ONCE SAID THAT WHEN YOU WILL GO, MANY WILL FOLLOW. DO YOU MEAN THIS AS A MASS SUICIDE?\nA:* I am not a Christian. I am not a Reverend Jim Jones.\nQ:* YOU DON'T WANT YOUR DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW YOU WHEN YOU ARE DEAD?\nA:* No, never. I want them to live and live abundantly. And when I am gone, I want them to celebrate my death because we celebrate everything: defeat or victory, life or death. Celebrate, dance, enjoy.\nQ:* IS THERE A LIFE AFTER LIFE? AFTER DEATH? A LIFE AFTER DEATH?\nA:* Yes, there is. But unless you experience it, my answer will be only a belief to you. I know it, but I don't want anybody to believe in my knowledge. I can help my people to come to the point from where they also can know. And that is one of my basic tenets: unless you know, don't believe: doubt to the very end till you come to know. And when you know, there is no need to believe. I don't believe in life after death -- I know.\nQ:* DO YOU MIND WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DO BELIEVE?\nA:* I mind because their belief will prevent them from knowing. They have moved in a wrong direction.\nQ:* YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE, DO YOU?\nA:* I want to take away all hope from people. Every hope. Because hope is the opium that all the religions have been supplying to the people.\nQ:* WHAT IS IT, THEN, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE WHEN THEY MAY NOT HAVE HOPE?\nA:* This moment is enough. Hope is for those who are unable to live this moment, those who are suffering and are in misery. They need hope; they only think of tomorrow. My people live today. And tomorrow never comes, it always\ncomes as today. They know the secret of how to live today, so they will be knowing the secret anywhere, anytime.\nEthiopia needs hope. India needs hope. Poor countries need hope. Retarded people need hope. Miserable couples need hope that in heaven everything will be perfectly good: your wife will not be nagging you there. Your children will not become hippies there. They will not start taking drugs and dropping out of the university there. You need hope. I am giving to my people the reality; hope is only a fantasy. The sick man needs hope for health. But why should the healthy man need hope for health? He is already healthy.\nQ:* IS THE MESSAGE YOU ARE BRINGING ONLY FOR SANNYASINS, ONLY FOR 500,000 OF YOUR DISCIPLES? OR DO YOU WANT TO BRING THIS MESSAGE TO MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD?\nA:* I don't want anything. My people are there. I have not searched for them, they have come to me. Those who are in need, they should seek me. If they are not in need -- get lost -- it is none of my concern.\nQ:* HOW DO YOU LIKE MY TIE? THIS WAS THE ONLY RED THING THAT I COULD FIND?\nA:* That is the only color I hate. I never use red. Q:* YOU MUST LOVE SHEELA.\nA:* Sheela I love, but not the red color.\nQ:* SHE IS RED AND ALL YOUR DISCIPLES ARE RED.\nA:* That is why I have given red colors to them -- because that is the only color I will never use.\nQ:* SO NONE OF YOUR CARS IS RED, EITHER?\nA:* There are a few cars which are red, but I am sitting inside and I don't see them.\nQ:* YOU ARE A VERY WISE MAN.\nA:* Of course. The wisest who has walked on this earth.\nQ:* IS THIS CLIMATE FINE FOR YOU, BHAGWAN? MUCH BETTER THAN IN INDIA?\nA:* Much better in every way. The water is clean, pure. In India it is difficult to find water which is not polluted. Just the other day I was informed that in India half the crops are eaten by rats and other animals. And the people, fifty percent of India's people, are almost starving. Whatsoever they eat, half of it is eaten by bugs in their stomach. So almost three fourths of their production goes to the animals or to the bugs. All rivers are polluted. Here, we have the purest water possible, the cleanest air possible. And we have enough land, space, 126 square miles. It is three times larger than New York City.\nQ:* ARE YOU CREATING A WONDER HERE IN THE DESERT, BHAGWAN?\nA:* Certainly. An oasis I am creating. And we have already succeeded much. When we came four years ago, there was only one house -- that was all. Now we have houses for five thousand people, fully equipped with everything modern. All the houses are centrally air-conditioned. The air is dry; that is what has helped me most. Because I suffer from asthma, humidity is a trouble for me. And I suffer from all kinds of allergies which are not curable. No allergy is curable; you have just to protect yourself against it. So here we have managed everything. My people have done everything so that for four years I had not suffered from any allergy. My back was bad in India, and in India they could not manage to do anything. Experts from England were called, the best expert. He also could not figure it out. But strangely -- I have used all kinds of cars available in the whole world -- just one car Silver Spur by Rolls Royce, fits to my back.\nQ:* IS THIS A COMMERCIAL, BHAGWAN?\nA:* I am absolutely a business man.\nQ:* BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY NINETY. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE MORE?\nA:* Three hundred sixty-five soon. Q:* EVERY DAY ANOTHER ONE?\nA:* Yes.\nQ:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM AWAY TO THE POOR PEOPLE, I UNDERSTOOD.\nA:* No. Never.\nQ:* I KNOW, BUT CAN YOU GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE THEN MAYBE A BIT OF UNDERSTANDING, A BIT OF LOVE?\nA:* I have given them for thirty years and in return they have given me poison, they have thrown knives at me. I am finished with all that nonsense. These Rolls Royces will go to my sannyasins, not to anybody else.\nQ:* WHAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING IS LOVE. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE LOVE TO PEOPLE THAT NEED IT?\nA:* My people are enough. I have one million sannyasins. What do you want of me? I am loving one million people. Do you want to kill me?\nQ:* YOU WOULDN'T MIND.…\nA:* Is it not enough? One million people? I am loving and loving as much as nobody else can love.\nQ:* ARE YOU A BETTER SHOWMAN THAN RONALD REAGAN IS?\nA:* I am certainly better in everything. I believe in the best. And if I start loving all those people, then what Ayatollah Khomeini is going to do? Then Pope the Pollack will be out of employment. And what Mother Teresa the Terrible is going to do? I take care of these people also. I leave business for them also. I don't want them to die without business. I have my business going fast like a wildfire; their businesses are shrinking, so I leave the whole world to them: serve the poor because your religion teaches that through service to the poor you will reach to paradise. I don't believe in any paradise. I say: Live richly herenow. This is paradise.\nQ:* YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, YOU SAY, AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE VERY MANY DISCIPLES OR FOLLOWERS, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD IS POOR.\nA:* I don't want them. I have more than enough.\nQ:* YOU DON'T WANT TO CONVERT ME, FOR EXAMPLE?\nA:* No.\nQ:* WHY NOT?\nA:* I don't believe in conversion. To me conversion is interfering in somebody's freedom. You can become a sannyasin; I will not convert you. You will have to\nask. You will have to beg on your knees to be accepted. And then too perhaps I may not accept.\nQ:* MAYBE I WON'T, BHAGWAN, HEARING ABOUT YOUR IDEAS. DO YOU RESPECT THAT?\nA:* That's great. I respect everybody and I respect everybody's decision, individuality. Even if he is wrong, it is his right to be wrong. But I will never try to convert anybody. In my whole life I have never tried to convert anybody. The people who have come to me have come on their own; if they stay with me, they stay on their own. If they want to go, they receive a good farewell. They can go. It is all freedom: no conversion, no enforcement, no conditioning. So I will not convert you, but if you want to become a sannyasin.…\nQ:* YOU WON'T LIKE MY COLOR IN RED...\nA:* I will put you all in red.\nQ:* YOU WERE TALKING YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY CAN LOVE JESUS CHRIST. I THINK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CATHOLICS CAN. AND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?\nA:* How many contemporaries of Jesus loved him? Q:* TWELVE, AT LEAST.\nA:* Twelve. And how many were present when he was crucified? One, at least, and the eleven had escaped -- and these are great apostles of Jesus. And the one who has remained has refused that he knows Jesus.\nYou take few grapes.\nQ:* I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BE WITH THE LITTLE THINGS.\nA:* You just take a few grapes.\nQ:* INSTEAD OF SMOKING, BHAGWAN.\nA:* Yes, they are very helpful.\nQ:* I MUST BE A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE WITH YOU, BECAUSE I DIDN'T SMOKE ALL DAY. I DIDN'T DRINK. I HAD ALL MY CLOTHES DRY- CLEANED. AND I HAVE COLD FEET. JUST TO SEE YOU AND TO HEAR YOU SAYING WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.\nA:* I know you must be in love with me. And you can see in my eyes and see my love for you. That's why I am saying take a few grapes.\nQ:* SO YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BHAGWAN?\nA:* No. I am going to take over the whole universe.\nQ:* YOU THINK THAT THERE IS LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS?\nA:* At least fifty thousand planets have life.\nQ:* AND DOES THAT COME ONCE TOGETHER? ARE WE VISITING THEM? ARE THEY VISITING US?\nA:* Yes. Life moves from one planet to another planet -- not bodies, but spirits.\nQ:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFO'S? UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, YOU KNOW.\nA:* No. That's all nonsense.\nQ:* PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLANETS VISITING US?\nA:* No.\nQ:* INVADING MAYBE? IT COULD BE A TEACHER OF THEIRS, A MASTER OF THE PLANETS.\nA:* Nobody is interested in invading this madhouse.\nQ:* WHAT IS YOUR SEX APPEAL, BHAGWAN? YOU HAVE SO MANY GORGEOUS WOMEN AROUND YOU AND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.\nA:* I love women, and women love me. Q:* ARE YOU A CELIBATE?\nA:* No. Why should I be? This is a strange question. Nobody asks: Do you breath? Do you eat?\nQ:* HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY SINCE YOU DON'T READ?\nA:* With so many gorgeous women, you are asking me: How do you spend your day? Read the book Arabian Nights and you will be reading my autobiography.\nQ:* WHY DO YOU SPEAK UP NOW AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS? IS THIS BECAUSE THE FRUIT ON THE TREE IS RIPE?\nA:* Yes, that is one of the reasons. But even deeper than that, I had gone into silence to let a few people drop out from sannyas. These were the people who were enchanted with my words, my philosophy, my approach towards the fundamental problems of life. I have been insisting that what I say is not important: the important cannot be said; the truth is inexpressible. You can know it in silence, but you cannot put it into words. So I wanted to get rid of those people who cannot understand my silence. The only way was to be silent. In three years I sorted out all the wrong kinds of people. In three years those who remained as happy with me as before -- these were my people. After sorting out the wrong kind, now is the time for me to say what I really wanted to say. The right opportunity was not there; now I have enough people who are ready to listen to me without any prejudice. And I have not to fulfill any of their expectations -- they don't have any expectations about me. So just to sort out the wrong people was one of the most fundamental reasons. Secondly, it is true -- in these three years of silence, the people who were living with me have come to a state of maturity, centering, grounding -- the fruit is ripe. The flowers have blossomed and now I would like to spread the fragrance unaddressed. Whoever wants it can have it; the fruits are here, just be the side on the table.\nQ:* IT IS THERE, RIGHT, BUT NOT FOR A NEW GENERATION, BHAGWAN, BECAUSE YOU ADVOCATE COMPLETE BIRTH CONTROL.\nA:* I don't care. Nobody cared about me. All of you are just accidental products. Who cared for you? Do you think your father and mother were thinking about you?\nQ:* YES.\nA:* NO. You are just accidental. Q:* THEY WANTED ME.\nA:* No. Because they never knew who you are. They may have wanted a child, but not you.\nQ:* I HAVE THEIR CHARACTER, A COMBINATION OF THE TWO.\nA:* There were millions of possibilities -- not only you. When your father was making love to your mother, he released millions of germs and one of them -- that is you -- reached to your mother's cell. All your millions of brothers could not reach and died. And their life is only two hours. If they don't reach the mother's egg within two hours, they will die. And the problem is that only one can reach, and the moment one reaches, the egg closes. It is rare that two male cells reach together so there are twins. Once a cell has reached, all others have to die. In every love affair millions of beings are being killed. And nobody knows who is going to win the race. I don't think your mother or father knew anything about who was going to win the race. It was fortunate that you won it, but nobody cares.\nQ:* THANK YOU.\nA:* Come back again and again. I will be waiting here.\nQ:* THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME THAT THIS INTERVIEW MIGHT NOT BE THE KIND YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO.\nA:* No. I am never angry about anything. I am always ready to adjust to anything, any situation. There is no problem in it.\nQ:* BHAGWAN, IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND TO TALK VIA ME TO YOUR DISCIPLES, THEN THE CAMERAMAN CAN MAKE SOME CUTAWAYS IN THE MEANTIME.\nA:* Okay. I would like to say to you that you are a potential sannyasin -- be careful.\nQ:* YOU HAVE SO MUCH LOVE FOR ME?\nA:* I can see it. I can feel it. I will be following you and I will coming in your dreams. I am a little bit dangerous.\nQ:* I AM NOT GOING TO WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, BHAGWAN.\nA:* No, that I can manage. If you want to come here and you want not to work seven days, you can work six days.\nQ:* THEN FIRST YOU MUST HAVE A GOLF COURSE HERE, BECAUSE I LOVE PLAYING GOLF.\nA:* We are going to have it. Whatsoever you love, we will manage to have it. Just come.\nQ:* I CAN BE YOUR GREEN KEEPER.\nA:* Perhaps our golf course is waiting for you to come here. I want my sannyasins to have everything that the world can provide.\nQ:* THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.\nA:* And they are having everything they need. Nobody has asked about a golf course yet.\nQ:* BUT THEY ALSO ARE THINKING OF PLAYING TENNIS, BHAGWAN.\nA:* Yes. They have tennis grounds ready. They have grounds ready for football. And soon we will be having a golf course. We can have the best golf course in the world.\nQ:* I SAW THAT YOUR GRASS IS GREENER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.\nA:* It is going to be. It is my grass -- real authentic grass -- which every government is afraid. Okay? Good.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #25 Chapter title: None 11 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEWS WITH HELMUT WERB, PHOTOJOURNALIST WITH: ROCK STAR, ITALY; MUSIC EXPRESS, GERMANY, HOLLAND; O'KEG, SWEDEN; MUSIC MAN, AUSTRIA; FI, ENGLAND; CONCRETE, MEXICO\nQ: I'M WORKING FOR TWELVE DIFFERENT MAGAZINES IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA. I ASKED EVERY SINGLE MAGAZINE TO SUBMIT ONE QUESTION, WHICH I THEN RELAY TO YOU. SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WILL BE DIRECTLY FROM THE MAGAZINES; ROUGHLY ONE-THIRD ARE MY OWN QUESTIONS. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ARE VERY SIMPLE, SOME OF THEM WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL...\nA: I will make the simple ones also controversial.\nQ: SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, REPORTED THAT THE NUMBER OF RAJNEESHEES WORLDWIDE ARE DECLINING, AND THAT YOU'RE SLOWLY RUNNING OUT OF RESOURCES. NOW AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SILENCE YOU HAVE STARTED TALKING AGAIN, YOU STARTED GIVING INTERVIEWS, YOU STARTED TO TALK WITH THE DISCIPLES. IS THIS PART OF A MEMBERSHIP DRIVE, OR IS IT JUST YOUR WISH TO COMMUNICATE?\nA: In the first place, sannyasins are increasing all over the world, so there is no question of their decrease. Secondly, I don't believe in converting anybody. I believe that the very effort to convert somebody is trespassing his freedom, his being.\nI can say what I want to say, but there is no effort to convert anybody to sannyas. In my whole life, I have never converted a single person to sannyas. Although there are one million sannyasins around the world, they have all come to me on their own accord. And I am against all kinds of missionary work, conversion, making people Christians, or Hindus or Mohammedans. Every individual has the right to be himself.\nI can say to the person -- not as an authority, that I am the only begotten son of God, so you have to believe me, and until you believe me, you are lost. If you\nbelieve in me, you are saved. These strategies are simply cunning, political, playing on man's fear and greed. Exploiting man, taking advantage of his innocence, ignorance.\nI am against the whole company of messiahs, prophets, founders of religions. A single man has declared war against all the religions of the world. I am fighting with every argument that they have proposed for thirty-five years continuously, and they have not been able to support any of their dogma, and they have not been able to answer any of my questions.\nSo the people who have come to me have come out of their own freedom, intelligence. They could understand me, what I am saying, and they could see the fallacy that I was showing them. But unless somebody comes to me, asks for sannyas, I am in no way going to interfere into his fundamental right of being himself. Right or wrong -- that does not matter -- who am I to decide what is right for him, what is wrong for him?\nI can say how I have found my bliss, my joy. That's all. If your heart starts feeling with me, if your heart starts beating with me, and a desire for adventure arises in you for new spaces, new ecstasies, I am available. Not as a leader, but only as a friend.\nThis is for the first time that one million people have gathered around a man who claims no miracles, who claims no authority, who claims no speciality -- who only claims that he is a friend. And if you enjoy my friendship, you are welcome. The moment you feel that our paths now separate, I give you my heartfelt blessings, the same way as I had given to you when you had come to me.\nNobody is prevented from going. Nobody is pushed, manipulated to come in. I have started speaking for my own reasons. I do everything according to my own reasons. I never bother about the world around me, and I don't care at all. For three years I was silent because I wanted few people who were wrongly hanging around me because they were intellectually convinced -- and that is not really to be with me -- I wanted to get rid of those people. But I am not rude to anybody. I have never said to anybody come in, I have never said to anybody to go out. But I have my own devices.\nThree and a half years of silence was enough for them, they could not stand it. They were interested in words, they were interested in my theories, they were interested in my arguments -- their approach was intellectual. They dropped out. The moment I saw that the wrong people had dropped, I have started speaking again. Now I am speaking to those people who do not expect me even to speak. In three and a half year silence they were with me with the same joy. If I was going to remain silent forever, they were going to be with me with the same joy. Now it is a question deeper than intellect. It is more close to a love affair. You don't think about it -- suddenly you know you are in love, suddenly your whole being starts feeling a dance, suddenly you start whistling, you want to sing.\nIf something like this happens to anybody around me, then only he is with me, my fellow traveler. So I have sorted out the people politely, given them the opportunity to leave on their own accord so I need not have to tell them to go away because they are with me for wrong reasons.\nLogic is a game. If two persons discuss something and one person wins the discussion, that does not mean that what he is saying is truth. All that it means is that he has more logical argumentative calibre than the other one. The other one may be the truth. The defeated one may have the truth, but is not articulate enough. So truth cannot be decided by logic, argumentation. Its decision is something deeper -- it is of the heart in the beginning, and in the end it is of the being itself.\nSo now I am speaking to my own people, and now I can open my whole heart to them without even bothering to argue what I am saying. Without giving any evidence, any proofs. They know me, that until it is something that is going to help them, I am not going to say it. It is not a question of right and wrong. It is a question of helping them on the path.\nSo now I have my people around the world. They are increasing every day, because I am the only alternative in the whole world against all the religions and against all the politicians. Against all nations and against all races -- I am the only alternative. I stand for the simple human being -- I don't want him to be German, I don't want him to be African, I don't want him to be American or Russian, I don't want him to be Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist, Mohammedan. All these are meaningless.\nHistory is full of all this nonsense, and because of this, man has stopped growing thousands of years before. I want man to be completely clean of the past, so he can become available totally to the present and to the future.\nThe numbers of sannyasins will be increasing every day faster and faster. For two reasons: The politicians are creating the situations -- I am not converting anybody. The politicians are creating the situation in which, if they succeed, this whole beautiful life on the earth will be destroyed. And the politicians can disappear only if nations disappear. War can disappear only if nations disappear. My people belong to no nation. They claim the right of the whole earth.\nThe religious leaders, on the other hand, have led people to a very dangerous disease: AIDS. Politicians have come to the nuclear weapons, that is their logical end: and religious leaders have come to AIDS.\nAIDS is a by-product of monasteries, nunneries and the preachers who have been telling people to remain celibate. If you put people, man in one place confined, women in another place confined, you are preparing the ground for homosexuality. Nobody can be celibate, it is against nature. It is against your physiology, against your biology, against your chemistry. So just taking a vow of celibacy is not going to change the whole program of your biochemistry. Then your biology will find some roundabout way -- that's what perversion is.\nAnd that homosexuality has ultimately culminated into this disease AIDS which is going to take over the whole world like wildfire. Only my communes will be the refuge, because only my communes, I am trying to destroy all kinds of perversions and bringing people back to nature, to their natural being, respecting their bodies, loving their bodies. And trying to understand that sex is natural only with the opposite pole.\nA man and woman can only create authentic orgasm. All other ways of orgasm are just phoney, and in the name of orgasm, nothing is achieved, cannot be achieved.\nAgainst nuclear weapons, I am the alternative because I am creating meditative people, silent people, peaceful people who do not want to destroy this earth. And against AIDS I am creating communes all over the world like oases where people will be back into the garden of Eden from where that idiot God pushed them out.\nQ: IN ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS, YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. I THINK IT WAS A TV STATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\nA: I am taking over it. I am already on the way, but my ways of taking over the world are not that (those) of Adolf Hitler or Alexander the Great. Those idiots have failed so badly that no intelligent person can try to take over the world in their way. I have my own way.\nMy way is to create more and more loving, peaceful, silent people around the world. That's my; empire, but in my empire, everybody is an emperor. Nobody is a slave.\nI am taking over the world. There is no other way for humanity to survive. Soon the people who are hostile to me will be begging that they should be allowed in the commune, because in the outside society if it is found they have AIDS, they are going to be condemned the way lepers were condemned in the past. Lepers were not allowed to live in the cities, they had to live outside. They could not move in the daylight, they had to move in the night. They could not take water from the well of the town -- they had a separate well outside the city. And leprosy is not such a dangerous thing.\nThere has never been anything more dangerous than AIDS. So anybody who has a little intelligence, then the politicians and the religious leaders are pushing him to become a sannyasin. I don't need to go for conversion. They are pushing people toward me.\nQ: THAT WILL BE IN THE END THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE?\nA: This is the only way -- not in the end -- right now, in the beginning, because in the end. It is all finished.\nQ: YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, HOWEVER, AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER.… A: No.\nQ: WHAT ARE YOU, THEN?\nA: Just a simple human being, just like you -- with a little difference that your eyes are closed and my eyes are open. But you can open your eyes any moment and the difference disappears. Or, I may close my eyes.… Just that much difference, nothing much.\nFirst I will try to open your eyes but if I feel that everybody wants to sleep, then why I should bother? I should go to sleep myself! I don't take anything seriously. Leaders are serious people, taking the responsibility of the flock. And that's why I call them names, because I cannot find worse condemnations for these people. Jesus I call crackpot, a mental case, a man with a wish to die. And his whole life is a life of a schizophrenic. The behavior is enough proof -- he curses a fig tree -- can you thing of why a man sane should curse a fig tree because there are no figs on it? And it was not the season for figs! The poor fig tree, what can she do? But he was angry because he had come from a village where people had refused to give food to him and to his twelve fools that he used to call apostles. And they were all hungry and tired, and then they came to the fig tree and there were no fruits.\nAnd this man talks about: Love your enemy. Even love your neighbor, which is even more difficult than loving your enemy. I can love the enemy very easily because there is so much distance between the enemy and me, but to love the neighbor is just like loving your wife. .\nThis man is talking about love, this man is talking about compassion, kindness and he is not compassionate to the poor fig tree. And anybody cursing a tree, what do you think about him? If I call him a crackpot, nothing is wrong in it. he was absolutely insane.\nHe interfered with people's ways of life. For example, in the temple of Jerusalem where money changers have been doing that kind of business for centuries, since the time of Moses when the temple was built. And in fact those money changers were of tremendous help to the land and to the people, because with all the donations that came to the temple, those money changers were giving loans to poor people on a very nominal interest. And Jesus goes and throws their tables and pushes them with a whip out of the temple, and he says that this is my father's house and I will not allow anybody to pollute it with money.\nNow this man has no proof that he is the son of God. There are many mad people around the world who think they are son of God, they are prophet, they are messiahs, and they are all in mental asylums. They also don't have any proof. What proof Jesus has? Any certificate from God, any, message stamped by God,\nsigned by God? What proof he has got -- just a poor carpenter's son. That too is not certain whether his father was his father.\nQ: BUT YOU ARE BHAGWAN, YOU ARE THE ENLIGHTENED ONE. ARE YOU PERFECT?\nA: No. The Enlightened One simply means one who has come to know himself. That's all.\nThe prophet dominates. He predicts. He gives you doctrines, theologies. You have to believe in him -- he himself cannot prove anything about hell or heaven or God, all are fictions -- but if all are fictions, his being a prophet flops because then without those fictions, how he can be the prophet? If there is no God, then how Jesus can claim that I am the only begotten son of God?\nSo these prophets are trying to keep all the fictions, all the lies, because amongst those lies they can declare themselves to be a prophet. And the people who can believe in a God no one has ever seen, the people who can believe in hell and heaven no one has come back to give us a little detail about these places, are gullible. Any cunning person, a little articulate can declare himself a prophet and these people will believe him because believing is all that they know. And if he is the type of Jesus, so angry that he throws single-handedly all the money changers out of the temple and declares that it is my father's house and I am going to clean it of all impurities, naturally the gullible will see and believe in him.\nI am not a prophet because I don't have any consolation for anybody, and I don't have any hope for anybody. I don't sell opium to people, and that is the basic function of a prophet -- he is a dope dealer.\nThe messiahs are trying to save the whole humanity. They have not been able to save themselves. Now Jesus must have been a fanatic idiot. Even on the cross he still believes that he is going to be saved by God, but when he sees that time is passing, blood is oozing, he is thirsty, he shouts at the sky.\nThe sky is empty, no answer comes. Never any answer has come from the sky. Millions of people have been praying -- no prayer has been answered. Jesus shouts, almost angry, frustrated, that: Have you forsaken me? He is talking to God. He was still believing that God will come sitting on a white cloud with angels playing on their harps singing alleluja. Nobody came, nothing happened. People simply laughed at the stupidity of the man -- even on the cross, he has not come back to sanity.\nAnd upon his crucifixion the whole Christianity is based. That's why cross has become its symbol: I call it \"crossianity.\" I don't call it Christianity, it has nothing to do with Christ. Its whole thing is the cross, and the cross is a symbol of death. So I don't say that Reverend Jim Jones did anything which goes against Jesus. he simply followed him to the very logical end. Jesus was saying to people: soon I will go and prepare ground for you and soon you will all be coming, and you\nwill be with me and with God the Father in paradise. Reverend Jones, of course, was an American and believed in speed and he knew that 2,000 years have passed and the \"soon\" is not finished yet. It seems a different time scale exists in paradise, so he did not want to take any chance -- he took all his followers with him. Why bother coming back and then take them.\nReverend Jones is just part of the whole Christian attitude, but strange it is that Christians started condemning that man.\nQ: A LOT OF EX-SANNYASINS LEFT YOU DISAPPOINTED -- MAYBE IN THAT PROCESS WHEN YOU DECIDED NOT TO TALK ANY MORE -- AND SOME FELT AND VOICED THEIR CONCERN PUBLICLY THAT YOU EXPLOIT YOUR FOLLOWERS TO SUSTAIN AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE. YOUR FORMER ITALIAN COOK, DEEKSHA, CALLED YOU A LIAR IN THE OREGONIAN; YOUR FORMER BODY GUARD SHIVAMURTI SAID YOU ARE DISHONEST -- I THINK IT WAS IN THE OREGONIAN, AS WELL. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE PEOPLE PERSONALLY? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?\nA: I love them still, the same as I have always loved them; and what they are saying is not wrong. I have never said that I never lie. If a lie is helpful, I am the first person to lie immediately.\nTruth is not a value to me. Helping those people who have come to me in every possible way -- and they are all asleep, they cannot understand the language of the one who is awake.\nSo every enlightened person has lied and, of course, they did not have the guts to say so. I don't have any problem in accepting the truth that I lie. The whole question is: What helps to wake you up? For example, if you are not waking up, I can lie and shout in your ears that your house is on fire. It is not on fire, but what to do? Hearing that your house is on fire you jump out of the bed and you wake up, and then I can say I am sorry that I had to lie, but there was no other way to wake you up.\nQ: HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO WAKE SOMEBODY UP?\nA: To the very end. I don't believe in half-hearted things. Anything I can do will be total, so if Deeksha says that I lie, she is perfectly right. There is nothing wrong in it. She is not condemning me.\nQ: WELL, SHE TOLD THE OREGONIAN REPORTERS THAT SHE HAS TO HIDE FROM YOUR FOLLOWERS NOW.\nA: That is up to her, and you have to ask her what she said, and why she said. How can I answer for her? I can answer for myself. About anything she has said\nabout me, I am ready to answer; but about anything else that she says, she is answerable, I am not.\nIf Shiva says that I am dishonest, he is right. To me everything can be used as a device to wake people who are fast asleep, unconscious. To me it is just a game. If honesty helps, good; if it does not help, dishonesty will do.\nAnd I love those people who have left. The reason must be in themselves. If they say they left disappointed, that means they have some appointment with me? Certainly, unconsciously they must be hoping that some expectations will be fulfilled by me, and I don't fulfill anybody's expectations.\nThose who can remain with me without any expectations, only they are capable to understand me and capable to understand the work that I am doing. These people, if they feel disappointed (it) simply means they had come with a certain idea, hope, desire -- and I fulfill nobody's desire. I teach desirelessness. I don't fulfill anybody's hope.\nYou must have seen the Christians have put a board outside my commune that those who enter here, drop all your hopes forever. That's perfectly true. They are doing my work.\nQ: DO THEY KNOW THAT?\nA: They don't know -- this is the difficulty. That's why I call these people idiots! So anybody who leaves me, leaves on his own responsibility. Anybody who joins with me joins on his own responsibility. So if you see these people, tell them that since I don't take anybody's responsibility and I don't promise you any hope, then the whole frustration is your own making. I am not a party to it.\nI have never claimed that I am an honest person. I have never claimed that I always speak the truth. Even under oath, you cannot manipulate me to say anything that I don't want to say. I will say only the thing that I want to say.\nSo all these allegations they think are allegations -- I don't think so. By saying such things against me they are simply showing that for its ten years or eleven years they were with me, they could not understand a single word of mine. They are simply saying that they are retarded, their minds are not more than thirteen years of age. Their physical age may be anywhere, but their minds are stuck at the thirteen. If they don't believe me they should go to a psychoanalist and let themselves be examined that how much is their mental age.\nWith me only people who have tremendous intelligence can stay. I am not Jesus. With Jesus all those twelve uneducated, illiterate fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters -- those were his disciples, not a single learned rabbi was convinced. That is very strange because he was a Jew. he was fulfilling, long awaited prophecies of the Jews for a messiah. In fact, they should have rejoiced that our days of waiting are over and he has come.\nBut not a single educated person was converted by Jesus. He could manage only with fishermen and woodcutter, uneducated, illiterate people. It was a kind of\nbribery and exploitation because he promised them: If you believe in me I am going to take you to paradise. Naturally those fishermen, woodcutters have never thought that they would ever be able to make -- rabbis, great scholars, saints, prophets, they will enter into paradise -- and this guy is saying that if we just believe in him, we will be the first to enter. So what is the problem, we are not losing anything. he says simply believe in me, so we will believe.\nBut no intelligent person can do that. In my people you will find just the opposite. My commune must be the only place in the whole world with so much education -- almost everybody is a graduate from some university. Most of them have masters degrees, few have PhD degrees, few are D.Litts. They come from all professions -- they are not fishermen and farmers.\nThey people who have left me -- for example, Deeksha; she is illiterate, she would have fitted with Jesus perfectly well, but not with me. She could not understand me. She was a good cook, but being a good cook you don't become enlightened. Shiva -- what intelligence he has got? If it took him ten years sitting by my side -- he was always sitting by my side -- if it took him ten years to discover that I am a dishonest man... then do you think I have to answer anything?\nQ: LET ME GO INTO THE NEXT QUESTION, IF I MAY.\nA: Go anywhere!\nQ: THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRIES DESPERATELY TO DEPORT YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO RAJNEESHPURAM IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO?\nA: No, I never think of tomorrow. I am here right now, and we are enjoying! And for four years they have been trying desperately top deport me. If in four years they could not find a single reason to deport me, I don't think in forty years they are going to find it.\nFour years is (are) enough against a single individual; and a whole department is continuously working. Their people are going around the world to find something so I can be deported. They will find that this is the most difficult case that has come to them.\nI am going to fight up to the Supreme Court.\nQ: BUT YOU HAVE SAID DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT YOU WOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA.\nA: That was just to visit. And if I love it there, then the same problem will be in Australia. Wherever I am the problem is going to be the same, so I don't care\nabout it whether the INS in America is trying to deport me, or INS in Australia trying to deport me. What difference does it make to me?\nQ: BUT IT WOULD MAKE DIFFERENCE TO RAJNEESHPURAM, WOULDN'T IT?\nA: Nobody can destroy Rajneeshpuram. If they succeed -- in the first place they cannot succeed, because I have applied on five grounds. They have only six ground. I can do the sixth, too. They have six grounds for application. For five grounds I am capable. They cannot deny on any grounds. Sixth is marriage -- I can do that, too. With as many women as they want!\nSo it is just out of (the) question. They cannot deport me, they simply will get crazy and cracks and retired, and I am going to be here.\nAnd if -- just for the argument's sake -- if I decide to go, they cannot deport me, but if I decide to go, they cannot stop me, either. Let them know it. They are absolutely impotent either way. If I decide to go, they cannot prevent me. And If I go, that does not mean that the commune will be in any way harmed or wounded.\nI have prepared my people that without me they can exist as beautifully as they are existing with me. Because I have not taken any responsibility. You should see the point: I have not taken any responsibility. I am not responsible for anything in the commune. I am just a guest. I am not even a member of the commune, I am not a sannyasin. I don't have any responsibility that they will miss me.\nI don't do anything; in fact, they have to do everything for me. If I am gone, they should really rejoice, and my being here is a constant trouble for them. Once I am gone from here, nobody is going to bother them.\nAnd I have my communes all around the world -- without me they are running exactly the same way, so there is no problem at all. INS or American government, or any government cannot create any problem for me. I can create thousand and one problems for them.\nThe moment I decide to create problems, they will be at a loss to find how to tackle with me. Up to now, I have not created any problem.\nQ: WHAT PROBLEMS WOULD YOU CREATE, FOR EXAMPLE?\nA: I can create any problem. For example, I can go to the Supreme Court that the whole American government is functioning against (the) American constitution. And I stand for (the) American constitution, and the whole American government is against it. And I have grounds to fight how they are exploiting and deceiving people.\nThe state government of Oregon is doing the same. They accepted this city, incorporated it, everything was done according to the constitution. For two years the city was legal. We were getting the support of the state, the federal\ngovernment support to the city -- and after two years, suddenly the city became illegal.\nThen who is responsible? All those people who make this city legal should be immediately arrested and imprisoned. The governor is part in it. The attorney general is part in it. What these idiots were doing for two years? They were giving state support, money, everything to the city. What the federal government was doing? They were giving money to the city.\nAnd idiots can go in such a berserk way about everything, that I don't think they have given much. (To Sheela, off mike:) How many dollars from the federal government have we received?\nSHEELA: ABOUT $32,000 LAST YEAR FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I THINK IT'S ABOUT THAT MUCH.\nBhagwan: That is nothing. I cannot even purchase one-third of a Rolls Royce. And these idiots are now asking the money back! In the first place they did wrong. They gave that money to a city which was not legal. They are responsible for it. In the second place, they have guts to ask the money back. From whom? The city does not exist. You gave money to a non-existent city, so go and ask the holy ghost if he knows anything about it!\nQ: THE PRINCE OF HANOVER WAS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SANNYASINS. HE WAS VERY ILL, AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT YOU ASKED TO CUT THE OXYGEN TO SHORTEN HIS SUFFERING. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TO DIE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES?\nA: That rumor is absolutely wrong. Do you think if the rumor had any evidence then the royal family of Germany would have remained silent? And the father of the Prince, the mother of the Prince were present at the funeral in India. The brother of the Prince was there, the wife of the Prince was there, the daughter of the Prince was there.\nIf the rumor has any validity, then the Prince of Hanover, his sannyas name was Vimalkirti. He was related to almost all the royalties of Europe. Prince of Wales is his cousin-brother. His mother is Princess of Greece. First she had married the Prince of Denmark, and then she divorced him and married Vimalkirti's father. His mother's sister is a queen -- perhaps in Spain or somewhere.\nAll these royalties against a poor man like me? Could not do anything if the rumor had any evidence in it? Just their being silent is enough proof that all this is nonsense. So as far as Vimalkirti's death is concerned, the rumor is simply a rumor.\nSo please don't get confused about my idea, my approach about the death of an individual. My way of life accepts that every individual has the birthright to et\nout of life if he wants. Death is not something that should be in the control of government, law. It is an individual freedom.\nIf I don't want to live in this body anymore, nobody can prevent me. And in fact, even though all the governments and all the legal systems are against it, suicide goes on happening every day. And it is such a amusing phenomenon, that if a person is caught redhanded committing suicide, then he is sentenced to death. Because he was trying to commit suicide! What kind if lawmakers we have? He was trying to commit suicide, now you are making arrangements for his death. He should have come in the first place to you -- that I am going to commit suicide, please kill me. Why I should unnecessarily take the risk of falling from a tree, getting broken legs, hanging myself from the ceiling, feeling suffocated, but not dying, jumping into a river -- but because I know swimming, getting out of it? Why should I, or anybody should take all these difficulties.\nSo as far as philosophical opinion is concerned, I am for individual's total freedom -- death included. And it is the duty of the community to provide him beautiful facilities for death. Why one should wait for old age and the troubles of old age, the degradation of old age, the rejection of the young people, the old person feeling constantly an unnecessary thing in the house, a burden to everybody? He is not capable to do anything for them, and they have to do everything for them. All his companions are dead, his friends are dead. He goes to the same park where he used to go and sit with his friends -- now he sits alone on the bench, nobody comes near him. Mostly he is sick in the bed. And if that person wants then it is simply ludicrous just to wait for death to come.\nAnd this death is going to be terrible, because he will be old, sick and he will die by and by, inch by inch, and we have now every scientific way to send him joyously into deep sleep forever.\nIf you and your society cannot give a man a beautiful life, at least you can arrange for him a beautiful death. And if he wants, it is his birthright. And anyway, anyone who wants to go out of life will find the way, so why unnecessarily create a legal system against? He will find a way. The people who fail in committing suicide are really people who are hesitant -- 50/50. In fact, they have a split mind. One part says it is good to get out of life, another part shrinks back and feels afraid. This inner conflict is the cause of their failure. Otherwise, I don't see that there is any way to prevent me from dying. There are so many million possibilities all around.\nSo you cannot prevent, and you think the penalty has to be an electric chair? Why you could not provide that beautiful electric chair before? The man would have said goodbye to his friends, enjoyed the best meal that he always wanted to, but because of sickness and old age and diabetes, he was not allowed. He can have beautiful ice cream, now there is no problem. He is going to the electric chair, he can have champagne. One day of absolute freedom because there is no tomorrow anymore. So he need not worry about his blood sugar going high, his blood pressure going high, or he is getting drunk and doing something stupid.\nWho cares now? At least one day give him total freedom and let him die. Help.… Your medical hospitals, all the hospitals in the world should have a beautiful place for those who want to die.\nHe can be taught even on the last day how to be silent, how to relax, so when you are given the injection which will take you deep and deep into sleep, you don't fight it. Otherwise, you will be in suffering. This can be simply explained. He can practice beforehand, do a little rehearsal. And I am ready to provide to every hospital one of my sannyasins to teach meditation. And his room for death should be a temple, beautiful, with flowers and with everything. He should go from this earth like a king. Just resting, relaxing and going forever into deep sleep.\nWhen we can manage it, I don't think we should prevent it. And, anyway, it is going to help world population problem immensely because 1,000 people are dying every day in Ethiopia.\nOut of hunger when one dies, it is real torture. Out of thirst one dies, it is a torture of days together. Why not they should be given injections which is simple, so they can relax and die and be reborn in America? Because they all want, all over the world, the poor people think America is the paradise on the earth. So if they died with the idea of being born in America, great; let them die with the idea, and let them be born there.\nI am perfectly in favor of freedom, and death is only one part of my whole idea of freedom.\nQ: HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY?\nA: Have I to spend it?\nQ: HOW DO YOU SPEND IT?\nA: No, I am asking you -- have I to spend it? I live it! Spending is not a right word. Life is not money, you don't spend it. Otherwise, one day you may go bankrupt. No, I live it and I live it intensely.\nEach moment of my life is a blessing. Whatever I am doing, I do it to the very climax. I don't believe in Gautam Buddha and his middle path. Gautam Buddha was teaching the middle path, I teach the extreme. If you are enjoying, what will be the middle path? 50/50? 50 percent enjoying, 50 percent in despair. When I am taking my bath, I enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed my enlightenment, not in any way different.\nAnd one and half hour in the morning, one and half hour in the evening -- three hours I am in the bathroom. And it is tremendously meditative, silent, beautiful just to lie down in the hot water and play with bubbles. I don't play with anything else.\nQ: HOW IMPORTANT IS SEX FOR YOU?\nA: Not at all. Just fun.\nQ: YOU SAY THAT RAJNEESHEE IS THE ONLY RELIGION WHO CAN REALLY FREE THE PEOPLE. INDIAN OFFICIALS SAID TWO YEARS AGO ACCORDING TO SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS HERE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES NOT RESEMBLE A RELIGION. DOES THIS HURT YOU PERSONALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE ABOUT THIS?\nA: No. There is no problem. In fact, that is what I am saying -- that my people don't resemble any people who have ever lived on the earth. They don't resemble any old religion. Neither do we want to be categorized with those insane theologies. It is a totally new phenomenon.\nQ: YOU SAID ONCE THAT YOUR RELIGION WILL DIE WITH YOU. WILL YOU NOT ASK ANYBODY TO CONTINUE FOR YOU -- PERHAPS SHEELA, PERHAPS ANOTHER PERSON, LAXMI, OR AN ORGANIZATION FOR YOU?\nA: Nobody. It is up to them whatever they want to do when I am gone. Do you see the politics in the whole idea of successors? That even when I am gone I will control through Sheela the commune. Because I have trained Sheela I can trust her, and she will remain in control. Then she prepares somebody else. And in a subtle way, though I am dead, I am controlling the living people. No, I cannot be so inhuman. While I am here, rejoice with me. When I am gone, you are intelligent enough, whatever you want to do, do. I am not going to declare anybody as my successor, and I am not going to say to my people what you have to do when I am gone.\nJust look at it from the other side: People only see one side always they ask me \"When you are gone,\" but you don't ask me when I am gone, you are gone as far as I am concerned. The world is dead. The moment I am dead, for me the whole world is dead. Now who bothers about a dead world? It is not one-sided death, that I am only dying. I am disappearing to you, you are disappearing to me. It is equal, equal death on both the sides. And I have no desire to control. I don't control even while I am living. But these people, for example, John the Baptist, baptizes Jesus, initiates him as his successor. This is a subtle strategy. Then Jesus appoints these twelve apostles as his messengers. And out of all that, by and by, the popes come in and for 2000 years, these people have been torturing.\nThe whole responsibility goes on Jesus, or even on John the Baptist. There is no need. I was not in the world one day, and the world has been here for millennia. Nobody asks me: \"Bhagwan, what have You done when You were not here for the world?\" Nobody asks that question. It is as relevant as the other question. One is about the past, when I was not here; one is about the future when I will\nnot be here. But both are absolutely meaningless. I am here -- that is the only place; and I am now, that is the only time. And I don't care anything. I am not going to write a will that somebody should be my successor.\nThere is no need. I give freedom, I don't give bondage like a Catholic church. In Spain just a few days before, the government has legalized abortion. Had to legalize because the population is destroying the whole economy of the country. Reluctantly, they legalized abortion, and now the church is fighting against it. And Spain is a fanatic country. They are protesting and they are saying that anybody who goes for abortion will be expelled from to Catholic religion.\nThese people can't see that who are you to dominate the whole world and its troubles and miseries and sufferings? On the one hand you go on saying we are here for your salvation, and whatever you do is just to create more misery for people. I do not belong to this mafia gang of popes, shankaracharyas, ayatollah Khomeini. I do not belong to these people.\nMy approach is very simple: while I am here, I will sing my song, I will have my dance, and when I am gone, I am gone.\nQ: IN AN INTERVIEW WITH AN AMERICAN NEWSPAPER, YOUR FORMER RANCH MANAGER BOB HARVEY, SAID THAT HE RESTORED SEVERAL MINES ON YOUR REQUEST ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RANCH -- THE OUINNS* MINE, FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT IS IN THESE MINES? AND IS IT CORRECT WHAT SANNYASIN DHYAN JOHN SAID THAT YOU; HAVE BUILT A KALI TEMPLE?\nA: That is absolutely wrong. Because in those three and half years while this man Bob Harvey was here, I was silent. I spoke only to Sheela. I never instructed him. That's absolutely wrong; I was not speaking. And it is true that there is a possibility of mines on the land, it is 126 square miles of land. It comes in the range which directly comes from Canada and moves through this property. Every possibility -- it may have oil, it may have gold, it may have silver, it may have copper; but we are not going to open those mines for the simple reason that we love our people so much that we don't want any hazard for our life. If you start working on a gold mine, you have to use chemicals which finally pollute all your water -- poisonous. In fact, one ranch just ahead of us has also gold mines. They were going to open them and we had to go to the court because their water moves into our ranch. We will not allow our water to be polluted, and we have stopped them.\nSo there is no question of our people digging up all the metals or oil or whatsoever is available in the land. And legally ten feet of the earth is ours, and unless we allow anybody to penetrate those ten feet, nobody -- not even the American government -- can dig the gold underneath. And we know how to be rich, how to be wealthy. Who cares about the gold? Let it lie down.\nAnd this man is absolutely lying that I had instructed. I have never talked with him. He had no business with me; he was a servant. He used to take care of this land before we came here. The past owners had put him as a servant here, and we accepted him for a time being, so that we can become acquainted with the whole territory. But that man cheated the commune. he was getting one thousand dollars per month from his owners. Our sannyasins are innocent people -- the accountant... he started going to the accountant every week to get\n$1000. Just a misunderstanding, the accountant thought perhaps he is salaried\n$1000 per week. Now, $4000 per month for a servant! Even a poor man like me cannot afford. And what qualifications he had for $4000? Even a vice-chancellor of a university does not get that much. The chief justice of the supreme court in Oregon does not get that much. He had no qualification, nothing -- just an ordinary servant. I had never given him any instructions. And because we are not interested at all in the mines, I don't think anybody else has given him instructions to find out. Because we are not interested at all. So many people have approached that they know there are mines here and they are researchers and they would like to research. We have refused them point blank. We don't want any research on our ground, because basically we don't want to create mines here.\nQ: SWAMI PREM LEELADHAR WAS INTRODUCED IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES AS A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZES IN SEX CHANGES. DO YOU PERFORM SEX CHANGES ON THE RANCH HERE?\nA: If somebody wants, it is part of their freedom. If somebody wants to change his sex, I think there is nothing immoral in it. You have lived as a man: you know what being a man is, and naturally every man is curious about women. In fact, it is said that nobody has yet been able to find the mystery of the woman. This is a perfectly good way -- change your sex and be a woman, and find the mystery. There is no mystery. (Laughter.)\nBut if you can live in one life both the sides of the coin, why not? I don't see any problem in it. The sex change is such a simple thing. The difference between men and women is so mall, almost negligible. It is just like if you pull your pocket out it becomes man; you put the pocket back, it becomes woman. And Leeladhar is really a great plastic surgeon, one of the best. I only believe in the best. So if anybody wants...\nQ: THERE ARE CONSISTENT RUMORS THAT THERE IS A HUGE ARMS CACHE IN RAJNEESHPURAM. I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE BEFORE -- I MEAN PEOPLE HUGGING EACH OTHER ON THE STREET, SMILING AT EACH OTHER, WAVING AT EACH OTHER -- WHY WOULD YOU NEED SO MANY WEAPONS?\nA: There are not so many weapons. We have a police force which is part of Oregon state. And for the police force, all the weapons and everything, the Oregon state is responsible, not we. We have a commune security force because I have been attacked many times, attempts on my life have been made, the last time in India when a knife was thrown at me, there were 10,000 sannyasins present. It was in a morning discourse. And because the police got some information ahead of time, 20 police officers had reached almost few minutes before the man threw the knife. So 20 police officers were eyewitnesses, 10,000 sannyasins were eye witnesses, and yet the court freed that man without any punishment. Because the politicians wanted him to be freed, because the religious leaders wanted him to be freed. There is so much hostility in Oregon, it is not a problem to me. In fact, I created it.\nBut my people are concerned about me, and if somebody comes to assassinate me, I will not hinder him. That is his freedom, I will not interfere with it, although he is interfering with my life, but even at the risk of my life, I will not interfere into his freedom. But my people -- why should I interfere in their freedom to protect me. So those few guards are here. And what a strange thing that in a world which has gone nuclear -- just those toy guns -- do you think we are going to attack America or Soviet Union?\nQ: YOU DECLARED DEATH AS THE BIGGEST ORGASM OF ALL TIMES ONCE. DO YOU WANT TO LEAD YOUR DISCIPLES INTO THIS SUPER ORGASM, OR DO YOU FEAR ANOTHER JONESTOWN AMONG THEM?\nA: No. This is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen. it can happen in the Vatican, it can happen in any Christian context. You should be aware of few things:\nBoth the world wars happened in a Christian context. Christianity for centuries has killed millions of people -- burned people alive -- it is a death-oriented religion, in the service of death.\nPoor Reverend Jones was simply doing the best he could. This is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen, because there is nobody who is a \"reverend\" here. As far as my idea about death is concerned, if a man can go meditatively into death, then death is the greatest orgasm you can feel. Because death is the separation of body and soul; it is just like when the physicist breaks the atom, there is such a great explosion. Just a single atom, which is not visible to the eyes, can destroy Hiroshima, Nagasaki.\nWhen man's body and his soul separate, if the man is alert and aware in that moment, he will see a tremendous explosion of joy, light, eternity, truth -- whatever you want to call it. But most people die unconsciously. Before death, they become unconscious, so they never come to know it. My people are learning meditation. There is no need for them to be especially prepared for death. I am\npreparing them for life, and in that very preparation, they are getting ready for death. Any time they will have to die.\nQ: IF I MIGHT INTERRUPT YOU, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT IF SEPARATION BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE, WOULDN'T IT BE DESIRABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT?\nA: No. Because before that you have to learn how to be alert and meditative; otherwise, you won't get anything, no orgasmic experience. Because the experiencer will be in a coma. The whole life is a preparation for death, and you should be able to be so conscious in life that when you are making love, there are not only two persons, but four persons. Two persons making love, and two consciousnesses watching, witnessing. Or you are walking on the road, you have to walk with watchfulness, alertness, so that you can see your own body walking.\nThe whole life you have to prepare; then only in death you may be able to retain consciousness. So it is not just separating the body and soul; otherwise everybody who is given electric chair will enjoy an orgasm. Then Jesus being crucified would have enjoyed an orgasm. Then all those Jews -- one million -- whom Hitler put into gas chambers. He did really great religious work: gave one million people spiritual orgasmic experiences, and still these Jews are against him. No, just death won't do.\nBetween death and you there must be full consciousness. Then only it can become an orgasmic experience. The whole life you need to prepare, and then death is the climax of life. Then it is not the end of life, but the climax of life. The whole perspective changes.\nQ: YOU SAID THAT EVERYBODY WHO WILL DIE IN A TWENTY-FOUR MILES RADIUS OF RAJNEESHPURAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY ENLIGHTENED. WHY IS THAT SO?\nA: That is true. Not everybody. There you are wrong. Only a sannyasin. Not Oregonians.\nOnly a sannyasin dying within a twenty-five mile radius will become enlightened. And this is not something new. It has been known in the East for thousands of years. Gautam Buddha had said exactly the same. He said within twelve cosas radius, any bikkhu that is his sannyasin dying will become enlightened.\nI was puzzled myself that how, what mechanism works? Twelve cosas are approximately twenty-five miles; but then I saw few sannyasins dying around me and becoming enlightened, their death was not death. I could see it.\nWhen Vimalkirti died, we celebrated his death as it is celebrated for an enlightened man. You could have seen on his face the joy, the marks of that orgasmic experience through which he had gone. He was still radiant. The body was still somehow carrying the stamp of the experience. And then, many sannyasins in these fifteen years have died.\nThen slowly, slowly I became aware why it happens. I am continuously in contact with my people. They love me so immensely that it is not a question of believing in me -- it is a simple unconditional love. So whenever a sannyasin will be dying, these twenty-five miles are something like an existential law, like the law of gravitation or the law of water evaporating at 100 degrees. Nobody asks why.\nAnd the scientist has no answer, he can say only that that's how it is. Never at 99 degrees; never at 101 degrees. Exactly at 100 degrees the water evaporates. But why the water has chosen 100 degrees? It is simply a law.\nThese twenty-five miles, Buddha has recorded; these twenty-five miles, Mahavira has recorded, another founder of a great religion, Jainism, a contemporary of Buddha. And I have experienced it, and now I can feel that the energy of a commune if it is a single enlightened person, then the radius will be only five miles at the most. But if it is a commune of thousands of sannyasins, the radius becomes twenty-five miles. Why? Nothing can be said about it. That's how it happens.\nAnd I don't know if the commune becomes bigger and still bigger, perhaps the radius will become greater. I hope one day here you will see 100,000 sannyasins, and then I want to see how big the radius can be. Can we cover the whole America? Our effort will be to cover the whole world. We have communes all over the world which will soon have the same effect. Just they need one enlightened person amongst them, and then all other sannyasins become kind of radiating, reflecting the energy field further and further away.\nAnd when a sannyasin dies in this loving energy field, it is easier for him to be awake than otherwise. It is just like if you are sitting amongst a few people who are yawning and dozing, soon you will find yourself yawning and dozing. And you will be surprized -- why you are doing it? Those people are creating a certain vibe. If you sit with people who are bored to death, soon you will feel a certain boredom entering in you. You may have experienced sometimes to be with someone, you feel as if you are nourished. And with someone else, you find as if you have been sucked.\nThese are very simple experiences everybody knows that with a certain person you gain energy, with a certain person you lose energy. People avoid these people because they are parasites. The enlightened person has an energy field of five miles, alone; but if he has a commune around him, then at least twenty-five miles radius is ready to wake any sannyasin dying within it. Why it works, there is no way to say. It is just the same as other scientific laws -- it is also a scientific law.\nQ: YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT AND SECRETARY, SHEELA, HAS MADE TREMENDOUS WAVES HERE AND IN AUSTRALIA RECENTLY ON TELEVISION AND PRESS INTERVIEWS AND IN THOSE WAVES CREATED, YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY BAD PRESS -- THE ORGANIZATION, YOU DID. DID SHEELA ACT UNDER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS OR DO YOU FEEL SOMETIMES THAT SHE'S GONE MAYBE SOMETIMES TOO FAR?\nA: No. She never goes as far as I want. She gets hit every time she comes back home, that this is not enough. You say I, my people, my commune got bad press. I want none of it. Because I know certain laws that if we can create bad news immediately existence balances it with good news.\nIn existence nothing can remain unbalanced -- soon the balance settles. Now, to create good news is very difficult, almost impossible. But to create bad news is very easy, very simple. And I know that the simplest should be followed. Create bad news and let existence balance it by good news. And you will see what I am saying; it has already starting.\nQ: BUT THEN IT WOULD BE EASY THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN, HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND TELL EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE HUMAN SACRIFICES ON THE RANCH, THERE ARE, WHATEVER HORROR STORIES YOU CAN COOK UP.\nA: We will do. We will do.\nQ: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE ON THAT.\nA: We will do. Everything. But we always wait for the right time to do it. There is a saying that no news is good news. It is not complete; it has waited for me to complete it. It says no news is good news. Its other part is good news is no news. Bad news is the only news there is. Create as much bad news as possible. Don't be worried.\nQ: DO YOU CREATE THEN THE BAD NEWS TO WAKE UP YOUR DISCIPLES, OR DO YOU CREATE THE BAD NEWS. ?\nA: I create the bad news to wake up my disciples and also to wake up those who are not my disciples, but will have to become my disciples sooner or later -- sooner the better.\nSheela is doing good, but she can do better.\nQ: QUOTED AS SAYING \"WHEN THIS WILL BE ALL OVER, I WILL BUY MYSELF A DARK SUIT, GO TO THE BAR, AND BUY A CIGAR.\" WILL YOU GO AND BUY YOURSELF A DARK SUIT?\nA: Someday.\nQ: SOON?\nA: Soon -- just like Jesus said, \"Soon.\" Q: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #26 Chapter title: None 12 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH KGO TV, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA QUESTION:* WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE A REPORTER LEARN HERE?\nA:* One thing and only one thing: that this is the alternative to your world. Your world is on the verge of death. The politicians have brought the nuclear weapons to create the funeral of the whole humanity. And the religious leaders, insisting on celibacy, have brought humanity to the ultimate disease -- AIDS.\nAnd the politicians and the priests both are bent upon to destroy the world. We are creating a totally new kind of man, with new values. And these communes are around the world now -- one million sannyasins, and we provide the alternative to your mad world.\nQ:* HOW IS THAT ACCOMPLISHED?\nA:* First the sannyasins only requirement is to be a meditator. And meditation means going into yourself, to the deepest core of your being, where absolute silence, serenity, peace, bliss are experienced. And once a person experiences those values then all ambitions about becoming a president of a country, or the prime minister, or becoming famous, a celebrity, all ambitions disappear. And if we can create millions of people who have no ambitions, that is the only way to prevent war. War is the culmination of ambitions.\nAnd the peaceful man, the silent man who has touched his own source of being, is no more Christian, no more Hindu, no more Mohammedan, no more Buddhist, no more American, no more Russian, no more German, no more Italian, he is simply a human being, and the whole earth is his home.\nIf we can destroy those ugly lines on the map which divide humanity -- there is no reason for war: one thing.\nSecond, if we can create such serenity and joy in people's lives all their perversions; homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, group sexuality, which all have culminated finally into AIDS, will disappear. Because we are creating such a contented man who needs no one to fulfill him. He is alone enough.\nQ:* I SUSPECT THAT MANY OF THOSE WHOSE RELIGIONS YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU DO ABOUT, WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH THOSE TENANTS, AND THOSE GOALS. OR AT LEAST WOULD VOICE AN AGREEMENT WITH IT.\nA:* They would not. There is no question of suspicion. I am certain they will not listen. They will fight back. They will be hostile towards me. They are.\nBut that makes no difference. I am not a serious man. If the world is going to go we will do whatever we can do, but our work is playfulness. We are not saviors and we are not here to save anybody. That is just by the way. Otherwise we are celebrants not saviors. We enjoy and we are enjoying, and who cares for tomorrow? Today is so tremendously beautiful.\nQ:* I HEARD YOU BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THE WORLD IS ON THE VERGE OF SELF DESTRUCTION ESSENTIALLY. AND THAT THERE IS AN ANSWER, THAT SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD, CAN BRING THAT ABOUT. BUT NOW YOU TELL ME HOWEVER, FORGET IT. BUT I THINK THERE'S PURPOSE HERE. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS PLACE SPEAKS OF ACCIDENT. EVERYTHING SPEAKS OF PURPOSE AND INTENTION.\nA:* That's the beauty of being playful, and yet not becoming accidental. Being nonserious, laughing, enjoying, dancing and yet doing everything that is needs. There is no contradiction. That's why I say we are creating a new man in which this contradiction melts, becomes complimentary.\nWe are certain that those idiots are not going to hear. Still we will make our best effort playfully. Knowingly that it is a hopeless task, we will enjoy the challenge. There is no contradiction in it.\nQ:* MUCH THAT YOU DO, OR YOU CONSIDER PLAYFUL IS RECEIVED OTHERWISE. AND THE CONFLICT WITH MANY AROUND YOU, WHICH I SUSPECT YOU RELISH, IS RECEIVED OTHERWISE. WHERE IS THE MESSAGE IN THERE FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD?\nA:* No message for anybody.\nQ:* WELL, IF IT'S A PLAYFUL... IF IT'S A PLAYFUL ATTEMPT I MEAN.…\nA:* Not even attempt, that's what I am saying, that our language is different, that our way is different. We are not making any attempt, any effort. We are simply enjoying the game.\nThe world is on the brink of death. We are celebrating our life. By the way, if we can make those people also understand that there is an* answer and life can be saved on the planet, good. If they don't hear, if they are hostile that is their\nproblem. We are not concerned. We are living already and we don't bother about future.\nOur whole concern is the present -- here-now.\nQ:* THIS PRESENT YOU ENJOY IN THIS PLACE CAME THROUGH PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE THROUGH WHICH YOU ARRIVED AT THIS DAY, DID IT NOT? THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY EVERYWHERE I SEE PLANNING, INTENTION, CONCERN WITH CREATING WHAT IT IS THAT YOU SEE TO CREATE.\nA:* That is your way of seeing. For example, I am here. You think I am serious answering you?\nQ:* NO, I DOUBT IT.\nA:* But I will answer you, and anybody will be clear that there is a purpose in the answer, that I am answering out of concern. No, I am simply responding playfully -- just a game. You put the question, and I respond with the answer. I don't care whether the answer received anywhere any response or not. That is not my business. My business is finished with the answer I have given. And I enjoyed answering it. My basic purpose is to enjoy. I love talking.\nQ:* IS THIS THE BEST GAME YOU'VE ...\nA:* The best, because it needs the most intelligent people to play it.… It is not football; it is headball. It is not football. Idiots can do that. It is head ball.\nQ:* IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU WERE A STUDENT IN YOUR EARLY YEARS, THAT YOU WERE A BRILLIANT STUDENT, THAT YOU READ EVERYTHING ON THE SUBJECT YOU STUDIED, AND THAT YOU HAD GREAT GRASP OF IT. WHAT DID YOU STUDY? WAS IT ANOTHER GAME? WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU USED FOR PREPARATION?\nA:* No preparation I have done for anything, ever.\nI have loved reading from my very childhood. My own personal library consisted of one hundred fifty thousand rare books of all the religions, philosophies, poetry, literature. And I have read all of them, but with no purpose; I enjoyed it. And the moment I felt that enough is enough.… I have enjoyed the best geniuses of the world, and now there is no more. I dropped. For five years I have not read a single book, not a single magazine, not a newspaper. No reading at all.\nThe students may have felt that I am prepared. In fact, I would like you to go with me a little more back. When I was a student, my professors felt that I am more prepared than them -- and I was. But I was not prepared.\nThey had stopped thirty years before when they left the university and became professors. And I have read everything that has happened in these thirty years. They were thirty years behind me. I was expelled from many colleges for the simple reason that many of the professors could not stand me. Understanding is out of the question, even they could not stand me.\nFinally I was admitted in a college with a condition that I will never attend a class. But I ask the principal how I am going to enter into the examination. Class is no problem, that is great freedom, good, but how I am going to enter into the examination? The principle said, that \"That is my problem. I will give you enough attendance to enter into examination. But it is a promise between you and me that you will not come into the college at all.\"\nAnd for two years I never entered that college, and I got into the examination, and I got the gold medal, I topped the whole university and the principal was amazed. He said, \"This is simply miraculous.\"\nI said, \"There is nothing. I have never read your textbooks. I have never listened to your lecturers, but I have such a love to read everything, and to go to the very depth of, to the very roots of everything.\nIn my reading there was no purpose, just joy. I relished it. For nine years I have been a lecturer in the university after that. That too, was a great joy. I relished, but the students were in a trouble. The university was in a trouble, because I will teach Aristotle, and I will also say that he is absolutely wrong. So first I will finish the course, and then I will destroy the whole that I have been teaching them. And they were in a great confusion then what is right.\nI said, \"Now, it is up to you. It is your intelligence to find out. I have presented Aristotle with absolute sincerity, but I cannot say that he is right. So I have to criticize him with the same sincerity. Now both are present to you; you can choose or you can remain confused.\"\nI was reported to the vice-chancellor many times. And I told the vice-chancellor that, \"Any day you want -- I have always carrying the resignation, but I will do only the way I want to do, because it is not a serious matter to me -- your service, your university, your textbooks, your examinations, that is nothing to me. To me, teaching is a joy. I am a born teacher.\"\nQ:* YOU'VE WRITTEN THAT YOU WOULD TRICK A FOLLOWER OR A STUDENT. YOU DON'T REFER TO THE SANNYASINS AS FOLLOWERS, ALTHOUGH THEIR FEET SEEM TO BE FOLLOWING YOU.\nA:* That is their problem.\nQ:* BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD TRICK A STUDENT TO TEACH A LESSON, AND THAT YOU HOPE THEY WOULD FORGIVE YOU THAT. IS THAT A TECHNIQUE THAT'S USEFUL TO YOU?\nA:* I have been simply enjoying everything that I have been doing. And you can enjoy only anything if you are not serious about it. If you become serious about it, enjoyment disappears, it becomes work, hard work.\nI have never worked, I'm a lazy man. I call myself a lazy man's guide to enlightenment. I don't do anything.\nQ:* SO THE ANSWER THEN IS THAT TRICKERY WOULD BE WORK?\nA:* Just enjoyment. Everything that I have done or am doing, to me is a joy. What it is to others, that is for them to decide. I have not missed a single moment of my life without enjoying it.\nQ:* THE ROLLS ROYCES OBVIOUSLY RAISE A LOT OF SILLY QUESTIONS... BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS A LITTLE SILLY.\nA:* It is not. It is not yet the whole thing.\nQ:* THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE BEHIND THAT.\nA:* There is nothing else.\nQ:* JUST TO PRICK THE HIDE OF THOSE OF USE ON THE OUTSIDE AND GET THEIR ATTENTION.\nA:* No, because I am loved by my sannyasins. Whether I have ninety Rolls Royces or not, will not make any difference to their love and their trust. And I don't purchase those Rolls Royces. They are purchased by sannyasins, and they are intending to bring three hundred sixty-five Rolls Royces. So tell those people that the silliness is still not absolute. It will be absolute soon. As far as I am concerned I possess nothing. Everything that I have belongs to the commune. You will be happy to know that from the shoes to my cap, everything is made by my sannyasins themselves -- even my wrist watch.\nThey love me and they want to do something for me -- love always want to do something -- and I don't hinder them. Why I should hinder them? Those who hate me, they go on doing their things and I cannot hinder them. I have been poisoned. I have been in every way put in a dangerous situation. Stones have been thrown at me, shoes have been thrown at me, knives have been thrown at me. Attempts on my life have been made. I have not prevented anybody. And\nwhy I should prevent my people who love me if they bring Rolls Royces, diamond watches?\nIt is simply a balance between the hostility and love, and in existence it is always balancing. I am just a witness, an outsider.\nQ:* A FORTUNATE ONE.\nA:* Certainly, the blessed one -- that is the meaning of Bhagwan. The word itself means the blessed one. And I am, and far more blessed than any other -- Jesus or Moses or Buddha, because nobody had such a worldwide family of friends and lovers and fellow travelers, none of them.\nQ:* WHY DO YOU SO POINTEDLY AVOID THE TITLE 'LEADER'?\nA:* Because it is ugly, it is exploiting.It is putting somebody down... suggesting that I know and you don't, so you follow me.\nQ:* IT IS A FAIR ASSUMPTION THOUGH.\nA:* That is their problem, you can ask them, you cannot ask me. As far as I am concerned, I am nobody's leader, nobody's... any responsibility I have taken on myself.\nQ:* BUT IF A THING LOOKS LIKE AN ELEPHANT, WHY NOT CALL IT ONE?\nA:* I cannot, because to me I have to insist my truth. If they are insistent in not listening to it, I am more insistent and will make them listen it. It is a competition between lovers. Nothing to be worried.\nQ:* THE QUEST TO INFLUENCE THE HUMAN MIND MAY WELL BE THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE NEXT DECADE OR SO -- FROM ALL FRONTS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT? IF YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE, HOW DO YOU SEE THAT KIND OF COMPETITION FOR BELIEFS?\nA:* My approach is totally different. I want to destroy all belief systems -- Catholic or communist, it does not matter.\nQ:* WHAT ABOUT THE BELIEF SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN BELIEF SYSTEMS?\nA:* It is not a belief system. It cannot be a belief system. It simply deprograms people, but does not program them. It leaves them clean, tabula rasa, no writing on them, just the way they were born, innocent. My function here is to\ndeprogram the Jew, the Hindu, the Mohammedan, whoever comes here. I have to destroy his belief system. I am not trying to influence him in favor of another belief system. I have none.\nQ:* IT IS SAID THAT NATURE DETESTS A VACUUM, THAT SOMETHING WILL FILL THE HUMAN MIND.\nA:* No. That is not true, because for thirty-two years I have been absolutely nothing. So it may be objectively true as far as science is concerned, that nature abhors vacuum, but as far as spiritual interior world is concerned, it is just the opposite.\nThe deeper you go, the more you find yourself empty. Ultimately, you find yourself just a zero, and that is the point of enlightenment. Your ego has disappeared,your greed has far away disappeared. You have disappeared, there is only light, life, infinite, eternal, but you are not there as a person, but just a pure consciousness, and it is nothingness. Buddha has actually given it the name nothingness -- nirvana; that* means nothingness.\nIn the western world, no religion has reached to that point -- all the western religions -- the three: Christian, Judaic tradition and Mohammedanism, which are born out of India. The other three religions which are born in India: Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism -- all three have reached to the point where you enter into an inner zero. And that is their ultimate goal: to be nothing, and it is never filled by anything.\nQ:* YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT.\nA:* You will not, and I am not surprised, because how can you understand something that you never have experienced. For example, if you have never tasted sugar, whatever I do, there is no way to explain you the taste of it. I will have to ask my sannyasins to hold you and force a spoonful of sugar into your mouth -- the only way. Looks a little hard, but what can be done? Unless you taste it you will not understand it. So if you really want to understand what I am saying about inner nothingness come here, be here for few days. Meditate with my people who have experienced it. Just being close with them, some kind of synchronicity happens.\nIf there are a dozen people who are deep in meditation, you simply sit in the middle of those people and try whatsoever they say, just sit down and watch your thoughts and do nothing. But those twelve people are radiating something towards you, and your effort together will give you the taste. If I have given the taste to thousands of people, you cannot be exceptional, nobody is. Everybody has the same spiritual potential.\nQ:* I AGREE WITH YOU.\nA:* Okay, and you will remember your questions, otherwise your questions will remain unanswered. Don't get involved with me, you just remember your questions.\nQ:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DON'T LISTEN TO YOU?\nA:* You just remember that you have brought questions. I have not brought any answer, so whatsoever you ask I will answer. It is going to be immediate, but to me it makes no difference what you ask.\nQ:* I'M AWARE OF THAT.\nA:* But it is my concern to remind you.\nQ:* THERE ARE PATTERNS AND SIMILARITY BETWEEN WHAT IS TAUGHT HERE AND HOW, AND WHAT'S TAUGHT IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW. AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE MANNER WHICH INVOLVES RHETORIC AND PSYCHOLOGY. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ASK YOU, \"IS THIS PLACE ANOTHER JONESTOWN? IS THIS PLACE ANOTHER WHATEVER?\" BUT THEY ARE CLEAR SIMILARITIES, AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE SOME SHARED KNOWLEDGE.\nA:* There are bound to be some similarities, because we are not the only human beings. Outside also there are human beings, so there are bound to be some similarities. I have two eyes, you have two eyes, but that does not mean that our basic attitude is the same. For example, you mentioned Reverend Jim Jonestown.\nQ:* I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE THE SAME. I'M OBSERVING THAT A LOT OF THE TECHNIQUES ARE.\nA:* No. Neither our intentions are the same nor is there any possibility of such a thing to happen here. Reverend Jim Jones and his Jonestown can happen only in a Christian context.\nQ:* HE WAS A MARXIST.\nA:* Marxism is a Christian product.\nQ:* HE FORSOOK RELIGION AS HE DEFINED IT, AND I REMEMBER A SERMON HE PREACHED ONE DAY WHERE HE THREW THE BIBLE ON THE FLOOR AND STOMPED UP AND DOWN ON IT AND SAID, \"THAT'S ALL\nBULLSHIT,\" AND WENT ON TO TELL HIS FOLLOWERS IF THEY FOLLOWED HIM TO GUYANA* THAT EVENTUALLY THEY COULD GO TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT RELIGION WAS TO BE FORSAKEN. PERHAPS PHILOSOPHICALLY YOU COULD CONNECT THE TWO, MARXISM AND CHRISTIANITY, BUT ON THE LEVEL THAT MOST PEOPLE DEAL AND WILL UNDERSTAND, THEY AREN'T RELATED.\nA:* They are related.\nQ:* BUT ISN'T IT MISLEADING TO REFER TO A MAN WHO DEFINES HIMSELF AS A MARXIST AS BEING A CHRISTIAN?\nA:* Certainly, because he still remains the Reverend Jim Jones. Reverend is a Christian title... not a Marxist title. You don't refer Reverend Joseph Stalin. And as far as Marxism is concerned, it is simply a reaction to Christianity. Remember that Jesus and Marx both were Jews, never forget that. And both were trying to change the Jewish tradition -- Jesus in his own way, Marx in his own way. Because Jesus has failed on certain points: the only begotten son of God, the existence of God, heaven and hell, Marx simply denied. There is no God, there is no question of any begotten son of God, there is no heaven and hell. In fact, there is no consciousness in man, it is only a by-product of material things.\nIt was really Jesus in a new edition in which all those points have been deleted which brought Jesus to the crucifixion -- only those points are. Otherwise, just as Jesus is concerned with the poor and says, \"Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of God,\" Marx is not different. He says, \"Proletariat of the world unite, because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\" The only difference is that Jesus was talking about a fictitious kingdom far away in the heavens, and Marx was a more pragmatic and practical man -- he was talking that, \"We can create that paradise here -- all that is needed is: destroy classes, make a classless society.\" But both were in favor of the poor, both were against the rich.\nJesus says, \"A camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man can pass through the gates of his god.\" Now this man seems to be the first communist! What do you expect of a communist? Even Marx has not such a strong statement against the rich. In fact he was living on the money provided by a rich man, Friedrich Engels; whole life he never earned anything. Friedrich Engels was an industrialist, a rich man, and he supplied all his needs, his whole life.\nHe could not say that Engels cannot enter into the kingdom of God; without Engels, Marx himself will not find a way into kingdom of God.\nJesus raises the poor to the highest level. He praises them and that's what Marx was doing in a more scientific way. Jesus was too young. He was crucified when he was thirty-three, uneducated, knowing nothing -- he was just a carpenter's son. Maybe he knew something about wood, but about God he knew nothing.\nKarl Marx is just another Jew, against the Jewish tradition, the richness of the Jews, their immense intelligence to create wealth -- Marx was poor, just as Jesus was poor. And you must remember that Marx's father was a reverend, so he was brought up in the context of Christianity. His father was converted -- he was a Christian -- and he was teaching Christianity to his children too. And whole communism is just a reaction against the Jewish wealth, their capacity to create wealth.\nThis man, Reverent Jim Jones, is doing exactly what Jesus was doing. He was saying to people that, \"You just follow me, believe in me, and you will enter into my kingdom of God.\" The only condition was, \"Believe in me!\" And that was the condition of Reverend Jones, \"Believe in me, and I will lead you to the kingdom of God.\" His kingdom of God may have been Sovietland -- that does not matter -- but he was the leader and you were the led; he knew what and where they are going -- you need not bother about it, need not even question about it.\nSecondly, Jesus said to his disciples, \"I will come back. First I will prepare the ground for you in the kingdom of God and then I will come back to take you.\" Reverend Jim Jones were far more intelligent than Jesus: why go and prepare; why not take the whole lot with you?\nThis is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen. It can happen anywhere within Christian context; it cannot happen in India, you cannot conceive. In Hindu concept you cannot conceive.\nQ:* OF WHAT? -- SUICIDE. THOUGH NOT ALL WHAT HAPPENS THERE WAS SUICIDE.\nA:* Jonestown -- Jonestown you cannot conceive under Hindu or Buddhist or Jaina or Tao traditions -- impossible, for the simple reason that Krishna, who is the God of the Hindus is a lover of life. He has sixteen thousand wives. Do you think such a man will...?\nQ:* COMMIT SUICIDE? YES, FRANKLY.\nA:* No! Suicide is committed by people who have only one wife. Having sixteen thousand wives, one is already living in paradise! What more you can want?\nQ:* I USED THE JONESTOWN THING JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF, OF THE ISSUE OF THE SIMILARITIES TO WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN.…\nA:* There are no similarities.\nQ:* I DON'T SEEK TO DRAW A CONCLUSION OF A SIMILAR END. WHAT\nI'VE SEEN IS REMARKABLE SIMILARITY IN TECHNIQUE.\nA:* Just tell me what.\nQ:* IN THE TECHNIQUE OF ATTRACTING, WORKING WITH PEOPLE.\nA:* What technique?\nQ:* THE TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION -- NOT PRECISELY THE SAME (TAPE INAUDIBLE)\nA:* Reverend Jim Jones.… Or even Jesus, has never heard what meditation is. They knew only prayer and prayer is not meditation.\nYou are finding difficulty now to... show the similarities. Meditation you mentioned, which cannot exist in Jonestown.\nQ:* THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION.\nA:* No. There is no control.\nThere is no control about anything. People are absolutely free to be here or not to be here.\nI DON'T SEEK A TRICK HERE AND I DON'T SEEK A FALSE COMPARISON, SO.…\nA:* No. I understand. I understand your intention. Just see one thing: in Jonestown, the major following was Black people, in this place the major following is White people. In Jonestown the people were all illiterate, uneducated... except for few. Here everybody is educated, most of them are graduates of universities, most of them has Masters' degrees, few have Ph.D.'s, few are D.Litt's. Not even few are uneducated. The uneducated, the illiterate, the poor, the Black -- these are the people who are very gullible, these are the people who are victims of all kinds of systems of belief.\nQ:* A STREET BLACK WOULD TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NONSENSE, THAT HE'S HARD TO CON, SO WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE?\nA:* They were just here for three month, to share homes with us. They were not going to be part of the commune and we were not interested in transforming them. Just whenever we have surplus money, and our people are so productive all around the world, that whenever we have some surplus money, we would like to share it with different groups. That was just the our first experiment to share it with the street people and to give them the same dignity as any other human being needs: give them the same love, the same equality, the same\nclothes, the same food, the same air-conditioned housing -- a taste of what they are missing on the streets.\nNever again we are going to invite them, because we have other projects, far more dangerous. In the next month we are going to have another project which is going to shake the whole America.\nQ:* I TAKE IT FROM THE FACT YOU DIDN'T VOLUNTEER TO TELL ME WHAT IS, THERE'S NO POINT IN ASKING.\nA:* There is no point in asking, because I would like to keep people in curiosity, suspense.\nQ:* A SANNYASIN ONCE TOLD ME DURING THE PERIOD OF YOUR SILENCE THAT YOU WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN AN ECONOMIC NEED AROSE.\nA:* That's wrong. We have never faced any economic need, otherwise my Rolls Royces will not be go on growing. One has come just now, one is coming within the next week, and one I am informed, my people are specially making: an old model of Rolls Royce, Phantom.\nIt is going to cost four-hundred-thousand dollars. Ordinary Rolls Royce costs only one hundred thousand dollars; it will take one and half year to be made, but it will be the most unique Rolls Royce in the whole world. So we are not out of economy. There is no question, for me to speak because my commune was not going well.\nMy commune is going so well that nothing else in the whole world is going so well! Five thousand people are here. They all have the best standard of food, the best housing, the whole commune is centrally air-conditioned, they have hundreds of cars, hundreds of busses, they have five planes, and we are not expanding, because the legality of the city is under litigation, so they have prevented us to expand. Otherwise I was going to bring one hundred thousand sannyasins here and I will bring. The litigation we are going to win.\nIn a democratic country nobody can defeat me.\nQ:* WHERE COULD A MAN LIKE YOU BE DEFEATED?\nA:* Only in the Soviet Union, never, no other place. They are afraid in Soviet Union. Already my books are banned. I have sannyasins underground in Soviet Union, they are being persecuted, already, but because of the government persecution, there is great excitement to become sannyasins. For the first time, against communism, there is a new movement. And the new generation needs something new. Communism is already out of date. Marx's books, who reads? No communist, nobody bothers -- it is just old testament. So that is the only place\nwhere I may be defeated, but not in America. If I am defeated in America then America is not different from Soviet Union; then it is a bogus democracy, hypocrite.\nQ:* DO YOU SAY THAT IN CONFIDENCE OF YOUR BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME OF DEMOCRACY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE...\nA:* Certainly.\nQ:*... SO THAT IF YOU CAN'T WIN THEN THE GAME IS WRONG?\nA:* I know the constitution of America and I am going to stand for it against the Americans, because the American government, the state governments are all violating the basic rights given to human beings in the constitution.\nI can play the game. I can play the game in Soviet Union also, if the need arises, because I don't think anybody has read communist literature more than I have read. I can play the game, but first I have to try America.\nQ:* WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY HERE?\nA:* This reason is clear: psychology is the latest development of intelligence, the latest science. And they can understand me more than anybody else. They are the most intelligent people.\nQ:* CAN THEY TEACH BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE?\nA:* That is not certain. To be a psychologist is one thing; to be a teacher is totally different art.\nWe have so many psychologists here that many Ph.D.'s are farming, many Ph.D.'s are creating dams, many Ph.D.'s are looking after my peacocks. Few\nperhaps are functioning as psychologists, psychiatrists, in the medical center. If somebody needs any help, if somebody is schizophrenic.…\nQ:* WHAT ABOUT IN THE MEDITATION COURSES AND IN THE UNIVERSITY?\nA:* Meditation is beyond psychology. It is not psychology. It has nothing to do with brain, it has nothing to do with the mind either. It is a state of no-mind. Even Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and Alfred Adler, had no idea of meditation, what it is. They all thought in terms of concentration. Concentration has nothing to do with meditation. Concentration is a method of the mind and meditation is a way how to transcend the mind, how to go above the mind -- so\nyou are on the top of the hills and all your thoughts are just in the valley -- and you can watch them and you can have a bird's eye view of what kind of mind you have.\nThese are three things: the state of no-mind which is your being, the mind which is what the society has conditioned you for, the third -- the brain -- which you have brought into the world with the body. The most bogus is the mind. The brain is a reality. The no-mind is a reality. The mind is only a program: Hindu mind, Mohammedan mind, communist mind -- the mind has to be labeled, because it is a program. And meditation is a deprogramming. It is going beyond the mind. Nobody can deprogram a meditation man -- impossible. There is no way. He has nothing.\nI am available: I give the challenge to any psychiatrist in the whole world if he can deprogram me. Just he has to be alerted that by deprogramming me, he may get deprogrammed!\nQ:* I SEE THIS BUSINESS OF COMPETITION FOR THE THOUGHTS OF MAN AND FOR THE INDOCTRINATION PROCEDURES THAT ARE GOING ON ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT HAPPENS IN ADVERTISING, IT HAPPENS IN THE MILITARY, IT HAPPENS IN CHURCHES, BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED.… THERE SEEMS TO BE A LEVEL OF IT THAT'S ALMOST FRANCHISABLE.\nA:* No. No indoctrination happens here -- sophisticated or unsophisticated -- because if you look at my books you will find thousands of contradictions in them. Talking to me is just a beautiful game, with words. I am not trying to preach a certain doctrine, otherwise I will be consistent. I will repeat the same thing.\nI have never repeated anything. And I have contradicted myself every day and I tell to my people never bring yesterday what I said. You ask directly right now whatever is your question, but don't bring that, \"Bhagwan, you said ten years before this and now you are saying this.…\" I have never read my books, and I don't remember ten years back. And why should I remember unnecessary luggage on my head?\nI am available, more alert, more aware, than I was ten years before. Q:* DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD?\nA:* No. That indoctrination is going on all over the place, except my communes.\nQ:* WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT LEADING, YOUR COMMUNE QUITE ASIDE, JUST AS AN OBSERVATION?\nA:* Everywhere. The pope is doing, Mother Teresa the terrible is doing. That\nwoman is terrible!\nQ:* THIS RULED MY QUEST: TO MAKE FOLKS SEE THINGS HOW WHATEVER PARTICULAR LEADER SEES THEM. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE HEATING UP AND HEADING SOME PLACE THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD AT LARGE.\nA:* It is happening there and the politicians are leading the world to a nuclear war, because they go on piling up nuclear weapons inspite of all their speeches about peace, love, friendship, coexistence -- but they all are piling up nuclear weapons.\nIn fact it seems to be a little crazy: already they have so much nuclear weapons, they can destroy this planet for seven hundred times. Now there is no need. There is no way for life to escape; they have already seven hundred times more than it is needed. But they are heading out of fear of each other.\nThe religious leaders are continuously trying to convert, particularly Christianity which is the biggest religion in the world, is trying to convert the poor people very easily. Because those poor people need food, those people need medicine, they need houses, they need jobs, and Christianity can provide them few things. And their own religion cannot do anything else but prayer to a God who does not exist.\nSo Christianity is trying to convert people more and more into the church, because it is also a political game -- politics of numbers.\nPoliticians and priests have been in a certain conspiracy always. The conspiracy is that they both need wars, they both need poverty, they both need people in suffering, misery, orphans, widows, sick people -- they both need all these people. Without these people Adolf Hitler has a statement in his biography that, \"Only in a wartime you can become a great hero,\" and that is true: all your heroes are wartime heroes. You don't know anything about, not a single peacetime hero. Politicians, if they want to achieve their ambition -- and they are ambitious people, otherwise why they should be in politics? Their ambition can be fulfilled only in war. The trouble is that the third world war is going to destroy all, so both parties are waiting and trying to find out ways how to prevent nuclear weapons or sabotage them.\nOnce either America or Soviet Union finds a method, that can nullify nuclear weapons, the war will be immediately on. It will be postponed till that moment, and that moment cannot be very long -- both the sides are continuously working how to find something as an antidote for nuclear weapons. Right now they don't have any antidote. Till they don't have the antidote, you can remain assured there is not going to be war. But soon they may find. There is not much problem in it. If they can find nuclear weapons, they can find something which negates nuclear weapons.\nAnd the religious leaders are trying to convert the poor countries, the poor people -- that is also the program of the capitalist countries. Against communism. America don't have a philosophy to argue. Against communism, America needs Christianity to argue. You cannot convert Indians into Americans, obviously. You cannot convert Japanese into Americans, obviously. But you can convert them into Christianity. So Christianity is serving the capitalist politicians and is spreading Christianity all over the world.\nAnd these Christians, their leaders, are against abortion, because if there is abortion. The religious leaders are against abortion.\nQ:* NOT ALL OF THEM.\nA:* All.\nQ:* EVEN THE ONES WHO SAY THEY'RE NOT?\nA:* Everyone is against abortion -- religious leaders. The Hindu religious leaders, the Buddhist religious leaders, the Christian, the Jews -- they are all against abortion, against birth control methods, against the pill for they all want more numbers. Number is their strength.\nQ:* YOU PAINT SUCH AN UTTERLY DARK PICTURE. YOU PAINT SUCH A\nPICTURE OF THE TOTALITY OF SELFISHNESS OF EVERYONE OUTSIDE HERE.\nA:* It is true. It is true. I am neither.…\nI am not a pessimist, I am not an optimist either. I am just a realist. So if it is night I cannot say it is day. And I am not painting it dark; it is dark. Absolutely dark.\nQ:* THIS IS THE ARK?\nA:* This is Noah's ark. This is where we are trying to pull the intelligent youth, so they can be saved from AIDS -- outside world will not be capable to save people from AIDS. They may be able to postpone the third world war, but who is going to postpone AIDS.\nQ:* HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT HERE?\nA:* Only we can do it.\nWe are already doing it. Every sannyasin is going through tests, and if somebody is found to have AIDS, he is not condemned; he is a victim of all old religions. We love him, we have made a beautiful place. Two persons we have found who have AIDS -- we have made a beautiful place, the most scenic for them, because their life is now short, and we are supplying them everything that they ever\nwanted. And we are going to create that place bigger -- if more AIDS people come to the commune, we will put them there with all medical facilities -- but AIDS cannot be in any way cured. All that can be done is those people can be prevented from spreading it, and that you cannot do in the outside world -- it is impossible.\nQ:* YOU'RE SAYING IT HAS TO BE A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT?\nA:* Yes. It has to be a certain commune where people love each other, respect each other. Even the person who has AIDS does not feel condemned. In the outside world the people who have AIDS are trying to hide it, otherwise the whole society will be turning their backs on them.\nQ:* I KEEP HAVING DIFFICULTY... IT'S THE TOTALITY WITH WHICH YOU CONDEMN US.… Q:* I'VE BEEN TO AIDS HOSPICES, I'VE SEEN THE TREMENDOUS CARE, THAT DECENT GIVING HUMAN BEINGS PRESENT TO MEN WHO WERE DYING. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE OF RELIGION WHO YOU CONDEMN BEING GENEROUS AND GOOD AND OPERATING FROM POINTS OF CONSCIENCE.\nA:* It is just your prejudice that has given you all these ideas. For example, if you look at mother Teresa from your attitude I am just taking an example, because\nI know her and her work.…\nAnybody who sees her work will appreciate it -- she is doing a great service to humanity: saving the orphans. But the real purpose of saving the orphans is converting them to Catholicism. All those orphans are being adopted by Catholic families. One American Protestant family went there. They were not aware that they will be refused. They were asked, \"Are you Christians?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So they were taken in and the receptionist informed that, \"There are seven hundred orphans -- you can choose -- but first you fill the register to what religion you belong,\" and then they wrote, \"Protestant.\" And the clerk said, \"Wait. Let me first inquire,\" and out he comes back and says that, \"We don't have any orphans right now.\" A minute before there were seven hundred orphans.\nThis man wrote a letter to all biggest Indian newspapers. I condemned on that letter mother Teresa. She wrote a letter to me. I had told her that this is absolutely ugly; you are trying to convert orphans into Catholicism, your concern is not the orphan. Your concern: one more Catholic.\nSecondly, you are against abortion, you are against birth control, because if there is birth control and abortion, where you are going to get orphans -- the whole supply of orphans. So on the outside it is white house, inside it is all black. @D She wrote to me that, \"I will be praying to God on your behalf, that he should forgive you.\" Nobody can say that something is wrong in it, but I know everything is wrong in that sentence. I wrote her back that there is no God, so\ndon't try to befool me. Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf without my permission? You are interfering into my life, without my permission -- this is trespass.\nSo the sentence looks beautiful, but when you dissect it, what she is saying that I am wrong, so wrong that I will be punished by God, and she is right and she is praying for me -- what great generosity.\nQ:* I CAN'T, I CAN'T SEE THINGS IN THAT BLACK AND WHITE. LIKE YOUR STORIES ABOUT MOTHER TERESA -- I KNOW NOTHING. BUT I DO KNOW THEY'RE DECENT PEOPLE OUT THERE.\nA:* You have to look more deeply into these generous people. These are the people who have kept humanity poor.\nQ:* YOU ARE TREATING TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AIDS; I HAVE SEEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THEM...\nA:* They are not serving, they are not servants of the people, they are not serving the poor. Service is not a respected word here.\nThey are simply sharing their love. And in sharing it is totally different. You give your love to those people who have very little time to live... and without any greed. All the religions in the world are serving the poor with a certain motivation that if they serve the poor they will reach to the kingdom of God.\nMy people have no greed, no motive; there is no God and no paradise.\nQ:* HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE I SAW WORKING. WON'T\nGET IT?\nA:* They enjoying it, they are just enjoying it. I have made everything here a celebration, and that is my religion: celebration. And we don't bother about anything else. If those two people are sick, it is part of our celebration to share our energy with them and prevent the disease spreading to other people. And we can do it perfectly. In the outside world, I know there are Senators in your parliament who have AIDS. But these people can hide it -- they are powerful enough -- they can hide it. And the person who has AIDS knows that he is going to die within two years time: he will make as many sexual contacts as possible.\nQ:* ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I WOULD GO OUT KNOWINGLY CONTAMINATE PEOPLE IF I KNEW I HAD AIDS\nA:* No, no. It is not a question of knowingly contaminating. The question is a man who knows that he's going to die. His immediate reaction will be how much\nhe can live in these two years or six months time. He has to live with speed, with intensity, that he had never done before.…\nSo this man is going to have as many sexual contacts as possible. Not that he is trying to contaminate anybody; he is just the flame which is going out.\nIn the outside world it is happening. Soon you will see.\nQ:* WELL, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.\nA:* The question is: you can be contaminated even by kissing and you may not know, because it is not only sexual intercourse that you get, get the AIDS.\nQ:* THERE IS A THEORY ABOUT THAT.\nA:* Yes. You can be just kissed by a friend and you may get it. And without knowing it, you may contaminate other people. It is a wildfire. And now there are few experts who are saying that there is a possibility to contaminate even by breathing -- then it becomes absolutely impossible. But in my commune, we will try to prevent that too. Everybody, all the sannyasins can use the doctors' mask. You will not be able to do that in the outside world. That's what I am trying to make the difference; the difference is here we are living together, caring about each other, loving each other. Outside world, you have your family, a small circle friends, but the outside world is big, and it is beyond control.\nAll the states and all the governments are trying to repress the information about people who have AIDS. For the simple reason, because it is such a condemnation. And if you repress the information, you are a criminal. For example, in Oregon, they have made the test for AIDS so difficult that almost ninety percent people who are suffering from AIDS will not be caught into it. This is what my medical people have informed me, that the test they are doing is such that ninety percent will be cleared out.\nQ:* I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THAT.\nA:* Yes, you should talk with them. And these ninety percent people who are given a clear certificate will not be contaminating anybody knowingly, but they will be contaminating all the same. Knowledge is not needed to contaminate anybody.\nThe outside world is crushed between nuclear weapons and AIDS. Perhaps nuclear weapons may be avoided, for the simple reason if we cannot find an antidote, the nuclear weapons cannot be used, but AIDS is unavoidable. Unless the world turns into small communes, and people start going on their own accord to be examined, and every commune manages for those people special places to live and supplies their demands -- I don't think the outside world is going to do that.\nThirty million people in America are almost in Ethiopia.…\nAnd America cannot do anything for thirty million poor people in America itself, but it goes on making more nuclear weapons. You have these mad people in power to be removed immediately. A great concern should be created in the outside world that these people are mad -- when your people are dying, even in India -- fifty percent people are on the line any moment they will be dying like Ethiopia: one thousand people per day. And the prime minister of India is selling wheat to outside countries, exporting wheat, because he wants nuclear plant and for that money is needed. Now these people should be behind bars.\nRajiv Gandhi is one of my friends... but still I say he should be imprisoned immediately, because what he is doing is criminal. People are dying and you are preparing for more death.… Strange. And you call that they are generous -- the pope is generous and goes on continuously telling, \"No abortion, no birth control, no pill -- these are all immoral,\" and to go on creating more children is moral.\nQ:* THANK YOU.\nA:* Although your questions have remained -- I'm worried about your questions.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #27 Chapter title: None 13 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY OF INDIA BOMBAY, INDIA\nQ:* FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS, YOU KEPT A MAUN. AND AFTER THAT , YOU GAVE IT UP. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE A MAUN? WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO GIVE IT UP?\nA:* There were many reasons. The most fundamental was concerning my sannyasins. I don't want them to be intellectually related to me, because that has nothing to do with the real experience of your being.\nThere were many people who were just hanging around me. They loved my words, they loved my way of thinking, and I am not a thinker, and I am not a preacher. I am not a prophet or messiah.\nI want to share my experience and for that only those who are capable of living with me in silence are ready to understand me. So for three and a half years I was silent. The basic reasons was that those people who were hanging around my words, were interested intellectually in me, dropped out.\nAnd the people who were in love with me -- not with my words or theories -- they remained. The moment I saw that all people whose concern was their head are gone, I have started speaking again. Now with these people, speaking is a totally different experience.\nThey can read me between the words, they can read me between the lines, and they are not addicted to my words. If I silent they are as happy as when I am speaking to them.\nQ:* BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ADDICTED TO YOUR WORDS AND BEING ADDICTED TO YOU?\nA:* There is a great difference. Being addicted to my words is just being intellectual. Being in love with me is total. Being in love with me is not a conviction, it is an experience. Being in love with my words, somebody can destroy it very easily -- just a little better argument and the person is finished.\nBut a person who is in love with me -- nothing can disturb him. His trust is not based on any argument, it is not philosophical, it is existential.\nQ:* ONE MAY DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM HIS LOVE FOR YOU; SOME MAY DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM THEIR LOVE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHY DO YOU THINK ONE KIND OF LOVER IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER AND NEEDS TO BE DROPPED OFF?\nA:* He is not only less important, he is absolutely wrong. His approach toward me is wrong, and what he is doing with my words -- creating certain belief systems, creating some philosophy, some ideology which is going to prevent him from knowing himself.\nMy whole work is to help people to know themselves, and those who become addicted with the words are creating a hindrance for themselves. It does not matter whether they are Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan or addicted with my words. It is the same thing: They are hanging in their heads, and the reality is somewhere far deep where no word has ever entered, and no word is ever possible to enter.\nIt is in your uttermost silence, in your meditative peaceful serenity. So it is not a question only of difference or degrees, they are polar opposites. Those are the wrong people -- unnecessarily wasting their time here.\nQ:* BUT DOES A MASTER CHOOSE HIS FLOCK?... HE LEADS HIS OWN LIFE AND BY HIS EXAMPLE, PEOPLE FOLLOW HIM. HOW DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHO FOLLOWS HIM?\nA:* I am not a leader. So nobody is allowed to follow me. They are my fellow travelers, they are my friends, and I am absolutely certain that who should be my friend.\nFollowers -- who cares? Flocks -- who cares? Crowds -- who cares? These are individuals. I care. And I don't want any wrong person for any wrong motive to waste his time. It is not harming me -- he is harming himself. It is out of compassion that I want him to be released.\nAnd they went away. The device worked perfectly well: they went away and new people have come in their place. While I was silent they became sannyasins. Their approach is totally different; their search is different.\nSo remember, I am not a leader, I am not a prophet, I am not a messiah. I have no business to do with all that company. I am a simple man just like you and my people. If there is any difference the difference is very slight.\nThe difference is that you are asleep, and I am awake.\nQ:* ONLY THIS MORNING IN YOUR DISCOURSE, YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT A SIMPLE MAN, YOU ARE EXTRAORDINARY MAN.\nA:* Only an extraordinary man can say it that he is a simple man.\nA simple man cannot say that.\nQ:* OKAY -- THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.\nA:* These are my friends.\nQ:* BUT YOU HARDLY INTERACT WITH THEM.\nA:* Continuously I am interacting. I am dancing with them, I am talking with them. I am sitting in silence with them.\nQ:* BUT IT IS HARDLY A ONE-TO-ONE COMMUNION WITH ANYONE.\nA:* There is no need. I have created the field where just sitting by my side is enough. Otherwise, they will be gone if there is no communion. What they will be doing here? For what they will be here? I dance with them, and they feel my love. They know my love.\nLove is something that need not be expressed in words, or expressed even in actions. They can see it in my eyes. You are seeing it in my eyes. Not only they are my friends, you are my friend.\nThat's why you are here. This is the beginning of a friendship and it is not going to end easily.\nQ:* IN INDIA YOU WERE PERHAPS IN CLOSER TOUCH ON A DAY-TO-DAY LEVEL WITH PEOPLE.\nA:* No. Not much. Just when I was initiating them into sannyas. Q:* BUT YOU ARE SLOWLY WITHDRAWING YOURSELF?\nA:* Yes, that's true. Because now I can have a contact even from distance. Now physical contact is not necessary, particularly with my people. Even though I never come out of my room, they know I am there. They know and they feel. In the beginning it was necessary to come into contact because that was the only language those people could have understood.\nAs love deepens, as meditation deepens, distance makes no difference. I have my communes all around the world. Those people who are in a commune in Germany, or in Holland or in Switzerland feel me as deeply as my people.\nQ:* BUT YOU HAVE THIS GORGEOUS FEMININE MAFIA IN BETWEEN.\nA:* That is true. Love always has a feminine mafia in between. It is really gorgeous!\nYou just be here and you see the whole ARABIAN NIGHT is actually lived here.\nQ:* YOU SPEAK OF FREEDOM OF ALL KINDS: INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL, SEXUAL. HOW CAN YOU YOURSELF LIVE SUCH A RIGID, BORING, DULL, DISCIPLINED LIFE?\nA:* It is not disciplined for me. It is not dull for me. It is not rigid for me. To me, it is the most comfortable life. It is not that I have disciplined myself, it is that living in many ways I have found the most comfortable way, the most luxurious way to live.\nQ:* BUT SURELY THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND THE MOST LUXURIOUS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE.\nA:* To me it is. To me it may not be. But whatsoever is the best to you is luxurious for you. And I don't say that all my sannyasins have to live in my discipline, the way I live, or the ritual of my living.\nNo. They are free to find out their ways. But I have found mine and I am perfectly contented with it. So it is not dull -- I am every moment enjoying it.\nQ:* IT'S AN EXTREMELY STRUCTURED LIFE.\nA:* It is not structured. It may look from the outside. It may look from the outside it is structured, it is not structured. I have.…\nFor example, I have tried to wake up three o'clock in the morning, I have tried to wake up four o'clock in the morning, I have tried to wake up five o'clock in the morning. I have tried to wake up eight o'clock in the morning -- and finally I found that six suits me the best.\nNow, for an outsider it may look a structured life that every day I wake up at six, but to me that has been the best moment. After that, the sleep becomes a headache. Before that, the whole day becomes dull, sleepy. But exactly at six I have found my time. And now scientists say that for two hours every night, you have the deepest sleep. If you wake up after these two hours exactly, you will have the most awakened day.\nIn those two hours, your temperature falls down, so it can be measured from outside, too. And I have tried that, that when my temperature falls down, it falls down between four and six.\nAnd exactly at six -- and this is a later thing -- I had found my time long before. For thirty years I have been waking up at six. But this is just recently I found out that scientists say that these two hours -- wherever in the night they happen, and to different people they happen at different times. Somebody may find it at five o'clock, somebody may find three o'clock.\nVinoba Bhave used to wake up at three o'clock, and that became the discipline of his ashram. Everybody has to wake up three o'clock. Now that is nonsense, that is stupid. Vinoba it may be the right time, but all those people in Vinoba's ashram are unnecessarily suffering. Then in the whole day they feel dull, sleepy. Change your diet, your diet must be wrong. Change your other habits, something must be wrong. And the only thing wrong is that they are waking up at the wrong time.\nSo, to me, it is not structured. I have looked for it and found the right point, the balanced point. The same with my food. I have found what suits me, how much is needed, how much keeps me in a well-being, and I go with it.\nI am a very luxurious, lazy, comfort-loving man. And I have found everything that is needed to make me comfortable. I possess nothing -- I am the poorest man in the world in that sense. Otherwise, I am the richest, because my people have made everything available to me. It does not belong to me, it belongs to the commune, but you will not find such a commune anywhere in the world -- now, or in the whole history of man.\nNo ashram with five thousand people has ever been there living in centrally air- conditioned. This is the only city which is completely air-conditioned in the whole world. And my people are eating the best food possible. Enjoying their life in different ways. It depends on them.\nQ:* IT'S SAID YOU ARE THE GURU FOR THE RICH.\nA:* Yes, I am.\nQ:* BUT HOW DO YOU COMBINE YOUR OWN LEVELS OF COMFORT AT EVERY POINT... WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH YOUR OWN PEOPLE FOLLOW?\nA:* My people have every facility available. We have the Italian restaurant, we have the Chinese restaurant, we have the Indian restaurant. We have the continental food available. We have the American food available. All kinds of wines and champagnes, all kinds of cigars and cigarettes. Everything is available\n-- they have to choose and find.\nQ:* THEY HAVE BASIC NORMS OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH THEY FOLLOW, WHICH MAY BE SELF-IMPOSED, OR STRUCTURED BY THE COMMUNE.\nA:* Nobody is imposing anything... It is not even self-imposed. The very word imposed is not right.\nQ:* HOW DO YOU COMBINE THIS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF YOURS WITH THE GROUND RULES OF THE COMMUNE?\nA:* There is no ground rules in the commune. It is a commune of individuals who are not in any way parts but members, living. And they have to live according to their own way. If they feel this is fitting to them -- good. If they feel this is not fitting to them -- good. If they feel this is not fitting to them, we have all kinds of work available.\nFor example, a doctor is tired with patients and hospitals and he becomes a sannyasin. We have a hospital, but he does not want to become a part of the hospital. He is fed up and finished. He wants to go farming: perfectly good, he does farming. And he enjoys it for the first time in his life. His whole life, he wanted to do farming.\nThere are professors.…\nQ:* THIS COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF A FARMER WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR...\nA:* A farmer cannot be allowed to be a doctor. He will be sent to study medicine. Even the doctors who have come here from different countries are not allowed to practice unless they get Oregon certificate to practice. The farmer needs no certificate. It is not a qualified job. It is not something that is harmful to anybody.\nQ:* BUT HE MUST KNOW THE LAND USE LAWS.\nA:* That we are fighting and we are creating our own land use. And the way we have used the land, Oregonians have never used it.\nFor fifty years this land was just lying down barren, a desert. We have made it an oasis. They will have to change their ground rules for land use, because we are showing them how land should be used.\nWhen I had come here there was only one house. And 126 miles of land -- just barren, dead, only few junipers. Junipers are known as camels of the trees, but they were also in a very poor, dying condition. Since we have come we have managed to make dams, we have collected rainwater enough that all the junipers have become big, thick, green.\nWe are making the whole city a green place, and those idiots are discussing in the courts about land use. They should come here and see how land has to be used. And they have much land in Oregon lying down like this. Otherwise, where can you find 126 square miles land so easily?\nIt was for sale for fifty years -- nobody purchased it. What they will do with a desert? We have changed it into a garden. Go on coming every year and you will be surprised that every year you will find expansion, more people, more trees, more birds.\nThere was not a single bird when we came here -- now there are peacocks, swans and -- because of the water -- deer from all other places have moved. We have thousands of deer now, and we are thinking to make a deer park especially for them. In fact, deer have never enjoyed such a luxurious life as they are enjoying here, because we have put the grass that they love most -- alfalfa. They are eating it too much that you will not find such fat deer anywhere in the world.\nQ:* YOU WILL NOT FIND SUCH PROSPEROUS AND WELL-KEPT SANNYASINS ANYWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER.\nA:* No, you will not. And these if you go in the night in the roads, they will be standing in the road, you will have to stop because they know my sannyasins don't harm anybody. So peacocks are there.…\nIn my own garden there are one hundred peacocks, and they won't give me way to drive. They are standing just there in front of me.…\nQ:* I WAS ACTUALLY PREVENTED FROM SEEING YOUR HOUSE.\nA:* You will be prevented, but not by peacocks! For that we have sannyasins.\nBut those peacocks or those deer, they have understood one thing: that these people are nonviolent, not any way harmful. You can be with them without any fear.\nQ:* THE OREGONIANS DON'T THINK SO.…\nA:* Oregonians are far retarded than the deer. Q:* THEN WHY THE SUB-MACHINE GUNS?\nA:* For the Oregonians who are retarded, because they will understand only the machine guns, no other language. It is not for the deer. No bird, no animal is being killed here. In Oregon there are every year ten years* freedom from the government to kill deer. All over the state deer are killed. This is the only place we have stopped... that no deer can be killed here, and if anybody kills a deer on this land he will be in trouble.\nThose guns have never been used yet, and I don't think they will be ever used. Those retarded Oregonians are so afraid, they don't come near. And we don't have long-distance guns. But if it is needed, we will have them.\nWe are nonviolent. We don't want to do any harm to anybody, but we are not Gandhians, that if you do harm to us, we will give you the other cheek. We are not Christians.\nWe respect you so much that if you hit, you will get a bigger hit. We respect your dignity, your individuality, your humanity. Christ's statement that when\nsomebody hits you on one cheek give him the other cheek is a humiliation of the other man. You are reducing the other man into an animal, sub-human species. You are becoming holier-than-thou.\nJust by giving one cheek.… What about if he wants to hit you third time? What cheek you are going to give? We don't give another cheek -- if somebody hits on our cheek, we will hit on both of his cheeks together, simultaneously. We respect people. We respect their humanity. We don't want to prove that we are holier than you. We are just as human as you are.\nThe hostility in the Oregonians is perfectly good for us. One thing: they don't come here -- no disturbance. That's what I wanted, for all sides fifty miles around we are completely isolated, doing our thing without any interference, without any trouble.…\nQ:* WHAT IS THAT \"OUR THING?\"\nA:* Many things. People are meditating. In India it was a trouble. Others were\ngetting disturbed because my meditations are one hundred twelve methods in which few methods are chaotic, dynamic, active. The people have to throw out all their screams, shout, throw out their anger, dance, jump, jog. Naturally the neighbors will be disturbed in the early morning, and every day the police were there that neighbors are complaining. So I told my people we have to find a place where no neighbors are.\nOne thing certain, the police is ours, so there is no problem. Q:* THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.\nA:* No. Not dangerous at all. The police belongs to the state government. They are part of the police government of the state, they have been trained by the state, but they are sannyasins and they know what you are doing -- you are not disturbing anybody. And we have such a vast land that you can go on doing in one corner and nobody will know.\nWe have a nature institute which allows people to live naked. They have a special lake for themselves. They can live naked, walk naked in the forest. Nobody is interfering. Even if you move naked in the streets of the city, nobody is going even to look back, what is the matter. It is your thing. That's your thing.\nQ:* IT'S A SAD COMMENT IF AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON IS WALKING NAKED AND NO ONE LOOKS AROUND.\nA:* Because everybody has his own freedom, even looking around is an interference. More than three seconds -- that's what psychologists have come to the conclusion -- more than three seconds if you look at a man, that is interference.\nQ:* WELL, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES ALREADY.\nA:* You have been doing immense interference. But, it is perfectly okay with me because you at least blink. I don't blink. You should see that. That blinking, I don't blink. When I am talking, I forget blinking.\nBut everybody is free to do his thing. If somebody wants to hug somebody on the street -- in India it was a problem. Unnecessary, that somebody is hugging -- it should be nobody's business. If you don't want to see, don't see. Just turn your back and go away, or close your eyes.\nHere, we are having absolute freedom. If people want to hug each other -- and it is a beautiful experience to hug each other.…\nQ:* BUT HERE YOU HAVE TOTAL FREEDOM TO HUG EACH OTHER, YOU ALSO GIVE TOTAL FREEDOM TO HIT EACH OTHER. AND THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.…\nA:* No. When people hug each other, nobody wants to hit each other; when people are prevented from hugging, then the only way to touch the other is by hitting. There is a basic psychology involved in it. Sigmund Freud said that people have invented guns, arrows, because they were prevented to hug each other, to love each other.\nLove is really a man trying to enter the woman. Now if that is prevented, the man will try to enter from a distance with a gun. That gun is phallic, according to Freud, and all other psychologists agree with him: that if you allow people total freedom of love, violence will disappear. Gandhi and people like him are responsible for violence in the world.\nIn Gandhi's ashram, nobody could fall in love with any woman. There was great discipline that no woman meets in secrecy with any man. His own secretary Karilal* could not follow this discipline. His own sons could not follow this discipline. The discipline is stupid.\nBut when you prevent people from loving, then their very energy of love becomes hate. Hate is not different from love, it is love standing on its head, doing sirshasan*.\nQ:* IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BELIEVE THAT IF HITLER HAD A JEWISH GIRLFRIEND TO MAKE LOVE TO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENCE ON THE JEWISH POPULATION?\nA:* Certainly. Hitler was rejected from everywhere. His parents rejected him, he was never given love by his parents. He was continuously condemned. He wanted to become an architect; no school of architecture allowed him. Then\nfinally he became a soldier. Now there is no way to avoid the fact that the man was basically interested in art, in architecture, but being denied from everywhere, only army was the place where he was accepted.\nAnd even from the army -- after the first world war -- he was thrown out. He was one of the most rejected persons in the world, and he took good revenge -- he did well.\nQ:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE DID WELL? YOU WOULD SUPPORT WHAT HE DID?\nA:* It means he has given you a lesson that: love people, respect people, a person should not be rejected so much that he becomes simply a maniac. That's what you made Adolf Hitler.…\nAdolf Hitlers will be born again and again if we cannot allow people freedom of love, warmth, dignity, respect -- just for being themselves. We respect people if somebody reaches on the Everest -- some Edmund Hillary*, then we respect him. If somebody invents something, we respect him. If somebody is a painter like Picasso, we respect him, but we don't respect people just for being themselves.\nEverybody cannot be a Picasso and everybody need not go to the Everest, and it will be silly. We have to respect people as they are without any demands on them.\nQ:* BUT YOU DON'T EITHER -- YOU ATTACKED MOTHER TERESA RECENTLY.\nA:* I attack Mother Teresa because she is doing so much harm to humanity. These are the people -- Mother Teresa is only symbolic, I call her Mother Teresa the Terrible. These people, Teresa, or Polack the Pope, or Jesus Christ, or Mahatma Gandhi, all these people in a very subtle way.… I never suspect their intentions, their intentions may be good, but their actions are dangerous: these are the people who are keeping the world poor.\nJesus says, \"Blessed are the poor.\" Now this is something absolutely wrong. The poor are not the blessed, they are the cursed! -- the condemned. But he consoles them by saying that you are blessed.\nQ:* BUT YOU ARE SELECTIVELY USING THAT VERSE. THE FULL VERSE IS: BLESSED ARE THE POOR FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH. SO THOSE WHO INHERIT THE EARTH CAN NEVER BE POOR, SO HE WAS USING THE WORD POOR PURELY METAPHORICALLY.\nA:* Just wait a minute.… Just wait a minute, you are quoting wrongly. I was quoting rightly: blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the kingdom of God, not earth.\nQ:* THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS -- THE KING JAMES VERSION SAYS THE EARTH.\nA:* There are not two versions!\nQ:* THE KINGS JAMES VERSION SAYS THE EARTH.\nA:* It is the kingdom of God basically in Hebrew. Kingdom of the earth is already possessed by the rich, it is already inherited. Jesus can only promise something in far away future, after death. All religions have been playing that game of promising people things beyond death. There is no evidence of anything beyond death, whether poor enter into the paradise, or rich enter -- more probability is that rich will enter.\nThere is no possibility for poor in paradise if there is no possibility for them here on earth! And these people... Teresa collecting orphans, what she is doing? Creating more poverty in the world. She is against abortion, she is against birth control, she is against the pill. These are sins. Naturally, if these things are there, orphans will disappear, and with orphans disappearing, who is going to give Nobel prize to Mother Teresa?\nI condemned her; she wrote a letter to me. In the letter she said, that \"I will pray to God to forgive you.\"\nNow the sentence looks perfectly nice, but not to me. It is nasty. I wrote her back, that \"In the first place, I don't believe in any God, so who are you to pray to a God who does not exist? At least you should have asked me.\n\"Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf? I have not given the authority to you, and I have not committed any sin that God should forgive me. If He meets me, He will have to ask forgiveness from me, because what He has done to the world is enough! All these Tamerlane, Genghis Khan, Nadirshah*, Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin -- who is responsible for all these people? Who is responsible for Ethiopia dying? Who is responsible for half the world being poor and on the verge of death? Who is responsible for nuclear weapons?\n\"If God is the creator, and if He is omnipotent, omniscient, He knows everything\n-- past, present, future -- He knows that there will be Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And even knowing that, He creates the world? He knows that there will be a nuclear war, and people are piling up nuclear weapons. Even the day he created the world he knew that one day there will be a nuclear war, and millions of people will suffer tremendous torture and death. And this is your God,\" I told her. She never replied. I again wrote her, that \"You reply, because otherwise I am going to sue you in the court. Who can on my behalf -- without my permission -- ask my forgiveness from God?\"\nThese people are simply trying to increase their number. All those orphans become Catholics; all those poor people, aboriginals, become Christians. The hospital, the schools, the food -- these are all strategies. Islam had the strategy of the sword. Christians have the strategy -- because the world has changed, ways have changed -- they come with bread and butter and one hand and Bible in another. Mohammedans used to come sword in one hand and Koran sarif* in another hand.\nBut it is the same -- just to purchase you. They are using people's poverty to make great numbers of Christians, because number has power. It is simply politics, nothing else; there is no religion in it. Just the pope before this polack who is now the pope, was a homosexual -- well-known over the whole Italy. And he was a bishop before becoming a pope, in Milan. And the whole Milan knew because he was continuously moving with a homosexual, a young man.\nQ:* BUT THAT'S PURELY A SEXUAL PREFERENCE.\nA:* That's what I am saying, that it is perversion, not preference.\nQ:* YOU MEAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO BELIEVES IN FREE SEX, YOU WOULD OBJECT TO PEOPLE EXERCISING A SEXUAL PREFERENCE?\nA:* No, it is not a preference. Otherwise soon you will be making love to the camera, love to the electric pole. And please, don't disturb my junipers. It is not preference, it is unnatural. It is a religious contribution to humanity, this homosexuality.\nIt started in the monasteries where only men were living and no woman was allowed in. It started into nunneries where only women were living and no man was allowed. Naturally, man is intelligent enough to find some way.\nAll the monks have been either masturbators or homosexuals, but in some way they have to do something. Their biology you cannot change by just preaching. Their bodies won't listen to your Bible.\nQ:* BUT YOU WERE A CELIBATE AT TWENTY-ONE. WHY CAN'T THEY BE?\nA:* I have never been a celibate. Q:* YOUR BIBLE SAYS THAT.\nA:* I have never been a celibate. If people believe, that is their foolishness. I have always loved women, and perhaps more women than anybody else. You can see my beard. It has become grey so quickly because I have lived so intensely that I have compressed in fifty years almost two hundred years.\nQ:* OF SEXUALITY?\nA:* Yes. But I am not a homosexual. These people have been talking of celibacy and creating sexual perversion. And the sexual perversion has led to the disease AIDS, which can kill almost two-thirds of humanity. Who will be responsible for it?\nQ:* WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN SEXUAL PERVERSION AND SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION?\nA:* There is no sexual experimentation. Sex is a purely biological thing, absolutely determined by biology. For example, in the wild no animal is homosexual, but in a zoo if only male animals are there and no female is available, they turn into homosexuals. Your world is a zoo, not a wild place.\nIn a wild jungle, nobody, no animal ever turns into a homosexual.\nQ:* SO WOULD YOU, LIKE ROUSSEAU, TALK IN TERMS OF GOING BACK TO NATURE, TO THE WILD?\nA:* No. I am not saying back to nature, I am saying forward to nature. Not back -\n- back is not my vocabulary -- forward to nature. There are tremendous treasures hidden in nature which these perverted people have denied humanity to enjoy. I am against these people because what they are saying and what they are doing ultimately results into something like a curse.\nAll the religions have been preaching celibacy. And nobody has ever bothered whether celibacy is medically possible or not. Even Mahatma Gandhi at the age of seventy was having wet dreams in his night. And you cannot find a more sincere man trying more sincerely than he tried to be a celibate. For forty years, no success. And do you know in the end he started sleeping with a naked woman? But Gandhians don't talk about it.\nGandhians even approached Mahatma Gandhi, that please don't do it. Vinoba was one of them, Kalila* was another, Maulana Azad*, Kreplani*, all asked him, \"Please don't do this experimentation\" -- in your language. It was not experimentation; it was forty years of failure of celibacy.\nAnd all these popes -- just two days before, one Christian minister has been jailed for one and a half years because he was using small children. That is experimentation. In the pulpit, in the church, he is talking about celibacy and inside the church he is abusing small children.\nOn father filed the case. He got for one and half years jail. How many others have come, because they were afraid to say anything against the religious leader. But now when he is in jail, many other children have said that the same he has been doing with them.\nBut this is not about one priest I am saying. All the priests have to do it! We are forcing them to do it. We respect their celibacy, and that respect is a bribe to remain celibate. And their biology does not know about your respectability -- their biology has its own laws and it follows its own laws.\nThe people who have been consoling the poor are the enemies of the poor. Poverty can be destroyed immediately. All that is needed is that nations should disappear -- only then wars can disappear.\nAnd seventy-five percent of every nation's income is going into war efforts. Even America is doing eighty percent income pouring into nuclear weapons. Now if the whole world stops this nonsense, what is the need to be poor. We have so much energy, so much money, so much scientific intelligence.\nBut strange, in England, in Europe, in America, too, they are destroying food and Ethiopia is dying, and soon India will be in the same position. And if you see Rajiv Gandhi, tell him that he will be responsible for India's poverty and people dying there, because he is exporting wheat OUTSIDE India and his own people are on the verge of death -- half of the country. But he wants a nuclear plant. Tell him that this is not a child's games, and you don't understand anything about humanity. You better go and become a pilot again, that is your place. You don't understand and you don't need to be a prime minister of a country which is suffering from poverty and you are looking for creating a nuclear plant. For what?\nEven if India puts every penny into creating nuclear weapons, it will take three hundred years for them to be equal in power to America or the Soviet Union. And do you think for three hundred years, America and Soviet Union will be staying where they are? It is stupid -- absolutely stupid -- for a country like India to think of nuclear weapons, atomic energy.\nBut they go on saying to the poor -- in India, all Indian religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, all go on saying -- \"It is your past life's bad actions, that's why you are poor.\" That's the reason -- because of these religions -- for five thousand years at least India has never revolted, suffered all kinds of poverty, slavery, accepted it, because the religious leaders were telling them that if you reward or if you do anything against it, you will have to suffer in the future life. Let me tell you one thing: you will be surprised. One of the Jaina great teachers\nin India is Acharya Tulsi -- it is a Jaina sect, Terapanth. He is the head of that community. Their basic philosophy is that if somebody is dying of thirst and you have water, don't give it to him because he is suffering from his past life's karmas. And giving him water means interfering into the punishment. He will be punished soon again. He cannot get rid of it, and by interfering, you have committed a crime; now you will suffer also.\nIf somebody is drowning, you simply go on walking. Let him drown -- it is his past life's actions, and you should not interfere in any way. For example, if you pull that man out of the water and tomorrow he murders somebody, you are also responsible in that murder. You see, the logic is great. If you have not saved that\nman, the murder would not have happened. So in the next life you will also suffer because you saved that man and took part into murder.\nIf you teach people for thousands of years that it is your bad actions in past lives which create poverty, you are stopping them from revolting, you are stopping them from doing something to change their situation. You are telling them, \"Just accept the situation in which you are.\" And that's how the East has accepted and remained poor.\nAnd still you want me that I should not speak against these people -- Buddha, Mahavira? I have to speak. To me these are far bigger criminals than Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, because those people have done very small harm. One million Jews Adolf Hitler killed, but how many poor people Mahavira has killed? And living in poverty is far more dangerous, far more suffering than dying in a beautifully, scientifically managed gas chamber in Germany. Within a second you are smoke, holy smoke, rather than suffering for millions of years.\nNo, I am against all these criminals. And I mean what I say.\nQ:* DO YOU THINK THAT IF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD DID NOT INVEST SUCH A LARGE PART OF THEIR MONEY, OF THEIR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN NUCLEAR ARSENALS, THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT MORE MEANINGFULLY? THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND SOME ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF CREATING A SITUATION OF TERROR IN THE WORLD?\nA:* The question is whether they invest in nuclear weapons or into something else all depends on us, not on them.\nQ:* IT IS BORN OUT OF THE DESIRE TO CONQUER, TO RULE.\nA:* I understand, but now it is absolutely idiotic. Up to now it was meaningful to conquer. With the nuclear weapons you cannot conquer -- nobody is going to be victorious and nobody is going to be defeated. All are going to be finished. In that way, nuclear weapons have served great cause: now war is meaningless.\nQ:* M.A.D. -- MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION.\nA:* Yes. So it is meaningless. They are not going for the third world war -- they will talk about it, talk about peace. They will play the games, and they will put small nations into fights and wars so they can sell their out-of-date weapons to them. But they are not going for a big war. Pakistan and India may go into a war, Bangladesh and India may go into a war, but Russia and America are not going into war because both are perfectly aware what it means. There is no victory.\nWar was meaningful, you are right, because it was conquering. Now with nuclear weapons, the whole situation changes. We can put this whole energy in\nconquering new planets, going to the stars. We can conquer nature which is deteriorating, and we can put the nature back into its harmoniousness as it was always. We can feed people. We can create medical food, just pills. If you cannot grow more wheat, you can just swallow a pill and that will do.\nThe whole world has to be made aware in what a situation we have reached: that war is absolutely meaningless. So now no more pouring your energies into more nuclear weapons.\nQ:* THEN WHY ARE YOU INVESTING IN MISSILE SILOS?\nA:* I am investing only in toy guns. Those toy guns are enough to keep the Oregonians afraid. They don't do any harm, but just keeping them there, they remain far away.\nQ:* THE RUMOR THAT YOU ARE SHIFTING TO AUSTRALIA, ARE THEY RIGHT? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCH PLANS WHATSOEVER?\nA:* No. I will be visiting. Q:* WHEN IS THAT?\nA:* That will depend. If America wants me to go out, to Australia.… Perhaps I may stay there forever. I have a beautiful commune there, on the sea beach. I may stay there. So there is a great opportunity for America to get rid of me. But first, my green card. With green card, I am not going out of America. I am going to fight up to Supreme Court.\nThey have six clauses -- six types of people to apply for American green card. I have applied on five. On each I will fight separately. One file will take twenty years to be finished by the time it reaches to the Supreme Court. On five grounds again I will start on the second ground. One hundred years, they cannot do anything to me. And the sixth clause is not difficult for me -- that is marriage. I can marry as many women as they want. But they cannot throw me out of America. If they are intelligent, they should immediately issue my green card, then perhaps I may never come back. If Australia is there... and I have my communes in beautiful places. In Holland we have purchased a great ancient Christian monastery.\nAnd it was meant for Christian monks and a school for Christian children, beautiful gardens, three hundred people's accommodation. And we are renovating it. I may stay in Holland.\nI may stay in Germany. In Germany we have twelve communes of the same size. Germany is my country. Now the color red is no more connected with communists, it is connected with me. And we have sannyasins in the Soviet Union. We have sannyasins in other communist countries. We have sannyasins\nin the East Germany. They are not only there, they want to make a commune. I am stopping them because if you make a commune and you come over-ground, you will be in difficulty. You remain underground. But they are so excited they want to make a commune in East Berlin. My sannyasins in Soviet Union are more excited than anywhere else.\nQ:* HOW DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM? OR HOW DO THEY STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU?\nA:* That I cannot say to you. But I am in touch and they are in touch, and everything is going just groovy! Anything...?\nQ:* IF RUMORS ARE TO BE BELIEVED, ON THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER, YOU ARE STARTING A NEW PROGRAM WHICH WILL POSSIBLE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH AIDS?\nA:* That's only a rumor.\nQ:* WHY IS THIS PARTICULAR AFFLICTION SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE?\nA:* Because it has no medicine, no cure. Q:* NEITHER HAS CANCER.\nA:* Cancer only of one type, but there are many types of cancer which have cure. They can be operated.\nAnd the people who have cancer are not contagious. They will not spread the cancer all over the world. AIDS is a different phenomenon -- no cure. The person is sure to die within two years. The person can contaminate not only by sexual intercourse, but by kissing. If his saliva comes in contact to you, you can get it. Kissing is going to be prohibited. In my commune I have told people that you drop kissing completely. You learn the art of Eskimos who rub noses... which is far more hygienic, and no fear of any epidemic. At the most, cold, which is not a disease. If you don't take medicine, it goes away in seven days; if you take medicine, it goes away in one week.\nI am concerned about AIDS, certainly, particularly for my people. My communes are creating every prohibition, precaution. Every sannyasin is going through tests.\nWe have found two sannyasins. For them we have made a beautiful... the most scenic place in the commune we have given to them. And we will take care of them, and they are respectable people, they need not hide it. They are simply victims of religions.\nIn the outside it is totally different. If somebody is found to have AIDS he will be just treated the way lepers used to be treated in the past. He will be no more a respectable citizen. In his own eyes he will fall down. He will not be allowed into restaurants. He may not be allowed to visit. Even his own family would not like him to live in the house.\nSo what is happening -- which is the most dangerous thing -- that people who have AIDS are hiding it. They are bribing physicians, doctors, and hiding it. I know absolutely certainly that one of the senators has AIDS. Now he has every power to hide it, and he will be continuously spreading it.\nIf it can spread even by kissing or by saliva... and there are few experts who are thinking that there is a possibility that if the disease becomes of enormous proportions, which it is becoming.… But governments are hiding, state governments are hiding, because nobody wants to accept the fact that your country is full of homosexuals -- because it is a homosexual disease.\nQ:* BUT IT HAS SPREAD BEYOND THE GAYS.\nA:* Yes, it has gone beyond now. It is not confined to only homosexuals, but it is created in homosexuality. Then it spreads. It can go to a woman; then from women it can go to another man who has never been homosexual. And there is no way.…\nQ:* BUT TO STOP KISSING IS LIKE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SHAVE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET A NICK IN YOUR CHEEK WITH THE BLADE WHICH MIGHT GIVE YOU TETANUS.\nA:* No, it is not that way. In fact, a man shaving his beard looks like a woman -- it is ugly. As far as women are concerned, they love beards. You can ask my women here. A man without a beard and a mustache is just half man. Just think of a woman with a mustache and beard -- looking like a SARDARJI*. That's what is happening to men. A stupid idea because men biologically feels attracted to the feminine physiology -- her face. He thinks that the woman's face is beautiful because it is without beard and without mustache. He is just a fool -- he does not know simple laws of nature. To a woman a man without a beard and mustache has no appeal. And you can see that all your prophets, all your messiahs... They had beards, and beautiful beards. And they influenced tremendously. Most of it will go to the beard.\nIt happened when Lincoln was standing for the presidentship in America, he had no beard, no mustache. He was a thin man, tall man, and ugly. While he was campaigning one small girl told him, \"Uncle, if you grow a beard and a mustache you will look far more beautiful.\" And the idea got into his mind and he grew his beard and mustache. Now it is very difficult whether that played some part in his winning.\nI am not saying that there are not exceptions. I am simply saying that it is not like a beard that out of fear you stop shaving -- because if that becomes the situation, then ninety-nine percent people die on the bed, so don't sleep on the bed! Just sleep on the floor.\nQ:* THEN HOW DO YOU STOP KISSING? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.\nA:* No. Kissing is totally a different matter, because we can find better ways. Q:* OF FOREPLAY? HARDLY ANY.\nA:* Many! Because you don't know the feminine body. It is all erotic. Q:* I'LL ASK YOU THOSE QUESTIONS SEPARATELY, PERHAPS!\nA:* You can ask separately, but for this you have to remember that the woman's whole body is erotic. You can play it from anywhere. It is a strange musical instrument. Vatsyayana knew it five thousand years before when he wrote his sutras. He suggests that lovers should press each other's earlobes and that gives great joy. That seems very hygienic. And, in fact, there are tribes... Eskimos never kiss, they rub noses.…\nQ:* THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.…\nA:* No. They know, because they see the missionaries and they think that these are fools. Even Eskimos think the missionaries are fools because they are transferring diseases to each other. It is not that they are unaware of kissing, they are perfectly aware. There are aboriginals in India, in Thailand and in other parts of the world where rubbing of the nose is the common practice, kissing is not.\nAnd when something like AIDS is standing on your door, it is a small question of being intelligent to take precautions. And at least try once, and how you feel... you may enjoy it more than kissing. At least it is more fun -- something new and novel.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #28 Chapter title: None 14 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH KEYI TV, EUGENE OREGON, TRACY BERRY,\nQ: ABOUT THESE PRESS INTERVIEWS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE PAST FEW WEEKS: JOURNALISTS HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT YOU FROM THESE SESSIONS. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT SOME OF THE JOURNALISTS?\nA: Nothing.\nQ: WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? YOU'VE CALLED YOURSELF THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHOWMAN. ARE YOU PLANNING TO PERHAPS TAKE YOUR SHOW ON THE ROAD?\nA: No, the roads will come to Rome. All roads will be coming to Rajneeshpuram. I'm not going on any road.\nQ: DOES THIS HERALD AN EXPANSION PHASE FOR RAJNEESHEES -- YOUR GOING SO PUBLIC?\nA: They are increasing, and they are expanding all over the world. Q: SPECIFICALLY, WHAT SORT OF EFFORTS ARE GOING ON?\nA: The same that is happening here is happening around the world in all of my communes. People are trying to live in a new way.\nThe past of humanity has failed, utterly failed. It has not been able to create a better man, a better society. Civilization has only remained a word; it has not been yet actualized.\nIn my commune, you can see the beginnings of a new man. The commune is not a family. It is just the opposite -- dissolution of the family. Families are small units which have kept people confined -- their love confined, their respect confined.\nA commune is coming into the open, out of your small circle of hypnotic conditioning. In the commune you are not a Hindu, nor a Christian, nor a Mohammedan. In the commune you are not a communist nor a fascist. The commune does not live according to any ideology -- political, or religious, or social. Each individual lives according to his freedom, according to his responsibility, according to his meditative consciousness. And the more a person meditates, goes deeper into himself, he starts living on the outside with new values which he had never known before: love, compassion, friendliness, joy, celebration -- and for no reason at all.\nPeople celebrate when there is some reason to celebrate. We simply celebrate, because celebration in itself is a reason. There is no need for any other reason. It is enough unto itself.\nOur people are free in every possible way. So we are dropping the old patterns of jealousy, competitiveness, politics. There is no politics, there is no competitiveness, there is no jealousy. If one lover moves to another lover, there is no antagonism. It is simply understood that it is human.\nMany inhuman things have been imposed on man. For example, marriage is inhuman. It is forcing two people to live together for a future about which they know nothing.\nHere, this moment is enough, and if the next moment also you find yourself loving each other -- good. And if you find that it is difficult, it has become nagging, it has become poisoned -- that you are no more interested in each other\n-- then to go on living is ugly. It together is wasting energy, the life of two people Both can move, and both can move before things become bad, before things go sour. When they are sweet, friendly, they can move with gratefulness for all those beautiful moments that they lived together.\nQ: DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A MORAL CODE? IS THERE A WRONG? IS THERE A RIGHT?\nA: No. I don't have any moral code. All moral codes are inventions of different societies in different geographies in different situations, but there is no moral code which is universal.\nSo I don't teach any moral code, because what is moral today may become immoral tomorrow. What is immoral today may become moral tomorrow. So I don't teach a code that fixes people with the past. I give them insight to see, to be clear, to be aware, to be conscious so that they can find what is good, what is bad in each situation without any code.\nMy people are not living according to any code, any doctrine, any creed. They are living according to their consciousness. And the whole effort is, how to raise your consciousness higher and higher. So to me, there is only one morality and that is being a conscious being. And then act out of it. You cannot act wrongly.\nQ: THE PERCEPTION OUTSIDE OF RAJNEESHPURAM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING AMOUNTS TO ANARCHY -- MAYBE A PLEASANT SORT OF ANARCHY.\nA: That is absolutely wrong. Anarchy is a reaction against what the governments have done to man. It is not a revolution; it is simply a reaction. And by reactions you cannot live.\nFor example, the founder of anarchy, Prince Kropotkin, simply wants all the governments to be dissolved immediately. That is stupid, because the man is not capable to cope -- even with all the courts, all the police, all the army and the whole hierarchy of government. Man is criminal, man is murderer, man is rapist\n-- so a this is stupid idea to dissolve all the governments.\nMy idea is not for anarchy -- that is not my goal -- but to create better individuals. Finally, perhaps one day we will have so many conscious individuals on the earth that there is no need of any government. But I am not preaching anarchy.\nQ: HOW DO YOU COUNSEL YOUR FOLLOWERS TO DEAL WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAND? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU URGE THEM TO PERFORM CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WHERE THEY SEE IT NECESSARY?\nA: No, We fight the government, the government agencies. And we follow their rules, because we are playing their game. And we can play the game better than they are playing. And in four year's time we have proved to them that how stupid they are. Laws are made by them, rules are made by them, but we can find loopholes in their laws and loopholes in their rules. And we are going to be here, and going to fight to the ultimate end.\nSo we are not against their laws. But their laws are made by mediocre politicians, and we have far more intelligent people to fight. We have the biggest law firm in the whole world -- four hundred legal experts continuously getting ready for more and more fight on more and more grounds.\nAnd your governments -- state government, the federal government -- they are all doing many things illegally, against the Constitution. It is their Constitution, it is their law, but they are doing things against it, going against it.\nWe will be in favor of the Constitution and we will go against them. We will be in favor of the laws and prove to them that they are acting illegally. So our way of fighting is not to disobey. Our way is to prove that we are obeying the laws and you are disobeying your laws. And laws are yours, made by you, and you have committed so many stupidities in them that we are perfectly capable to fight with you.\nQ: IT MUST BE DISAPPOINTING TO YOU TO HAVE MET WITH THE LEVEL OF REJECTION AND PERSECUTION.\nA: No. In fact, it was perfectly expected. Any new idea has to be ready to accept the challenge of hostility, rejection, persecution. I would have been disappointed if they had ignored me. They could not ignore me.\nAnd strange, it is a small commune, living in a desert trying to make the desert green, an oasis, and they are terrified. These people who are living, loving, dancing, singing -- what harm are these people going to do to them?\nIn four years' time we have not committed a single crime. In the commune not a single rape has happened. There is no prostitute in the commune. There is no murderer in the commune. There is no thief in the commune. The police in the commune are just sitting, doing nothing, because there is nothing.\nWe have the city magistrate, but in the court, in four years, nobody has been brought as a criminal. Against such peaceful, loving people the whole of Oregon is afraid. They must be just retarded people.\nQ: IT ALSO SOUNDS, THOUGH, LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING SOME OF THE COMMOTION YOU'RE CAUSING AROUND THE STATE.\nA: Mm? I want -- because that gives us strength. Every challenge brings us strength. And we will go on creating more and more challenges. We will not let them sleep peacefully. We sleep peacefully -- we have no trouble.\nQ: HAS THE FUROR THROUGHOUT OREGON AND THE U.S. CONTRIBUTED AT ALL TO THIS CYNICISM?\nA: The U.S. has nothing to give to me. In fact, in that way I am disappointed. I was thinking that America must be more intelligent than any other country, less prejudiced than any other country -- really democratic -- but being here for four years what I have found is that democracy is just in the name. Behind the democracy everything undemocratic is going on.\nOur own experience is a proof of it. I have not found that America is really a country where individuals are respected, freedom of speech is respected. It is only talked about. And I don't see any sense of humor -- not at all.\nThey have been taking us so seriously -- and we are taking them so nonseriously; but they cannot understand. We are all the time joking, but they cannot understand simple jokes. They are having secret meetings -- the governor, the attorney general, and they did not allow -- they were discussing us and they did not allow any one of our representatives to be there. If you are discussing us -- at least it is simple courtesy that at least one person from our side should be there and you should listen to what we have to say. They did not allow... they did not allow any journalist either. The governor said, \"After our secret meeting I will talk to you and inform you.\" And whatever he informed us about was simply lies\nand nothing else because we have found the confidential file which says just the opposite.\nWhat he had said to the people, to the journalists, to the media -- he was saying that everything is under control and we are pacifying people, there is no problem to be worried, the heat is cooling down.\nAnd in the secret report that they prepared inside they are alerting the army to remain ready. Any moment, if they are ordered, they have to reach Rajneeshpuram in three hours.\nNow, what kind of people are these? And what is the need of bringing the army here? We are not a nation, that you have to attack us? And they are lying to the media that things are getting settled and there is no problem. If there is no problem, then why is the army given the alert? And why have you given them a time, that within three hours you have to reach Rajneeshpuram?\nSo these people, I don't think, have any sense of humor. They are just dodos.\nQ: WHO DO YOU FEEL HAS TREATED YOU FAIRLY SINCE YOU'VE COME TO THIS COUNTRY? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS BEEN AGAINST YOU.\nA: Not everyone. Most of the journalists have been very fair, very loving. And those are the only people I have come in contact with from the outside world. And they have been intelligent and they could understand what I am saying and they could understand the sense of humor.\nAll the journalists who have come here, except one or two, have enjoyed the place, loved the place, wanted to come again and again.\nQ: DID YOU PLAN TO MAYBE GO OUT AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE? A: No...\nQ: IF YOU WENT OUT AND MET OREGON AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE, AND THEY FOUND OUT YOU WEREN'T THIS HORRIBLE MONSTER, IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF RED-ROBED FOLLOWERS, IT WOULD BE EASIER THAT WAY?\nA: No, it would not be, because I have been for thirty years in India, moving around the country; no, it is not so. Shoes have been thrown at me; stones have been thrown at me. I am speaking and in the crowd a band is playing so nobody can hear what I am saying.\nPoison has been given me twice, to kill. And the last thing before I left was an attempt on my life.\nSo I know... and I have had enough of it, so I want to be here; if anybody is thirsty, he can come. If he wants to think me a monster, so far so good. That will give him good nightmares.\nQ: WELL, LET'S SAY, I'M THE AVERAGE PERSON IN EUGENE OR PORTLAND, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT'S ON THE NEWS OR IN THE PAPER, DOES THAT MEAN THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE TO RAJNEESHPURAM TO FIND OUT OR HOW WOULD I GET.\nA: That's the only way. You have to come. And it is such an experiment that there is no other way, you have to come here and be here and meet people and see with your own eyes what is happening.\nAnd it is open. It is not like Soviet Russia, that you can not enter here, that you cannot meet people, that you cannot remain for a few days as our guest. And you can move freely, nobody is preventing you. That's the only way.\nAnd we have our communes all over the world. So if Germans wants to know about us, in Germany we have twelve communes. If Holland wants to know us, we have our communes there. On the same pattern, the same way of life, the same approach towards life, we have places in Australia, in India. We are opening in Japan, and soon we'll be all over the world. Small oases, so whoever wants to know about us has to travel and visit our communes.\nQ: THE RUMORS THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BE MOVING TO AUSTRALIA... AND YET, I SEE A LOT OF EXPANSION GOING ON HERE, WHAT IS THE REAL STORY?\nA: I was just joking. Because Australia seems to be so much afraid of me. Only Sheela has been there, my secretary, and she has created so much turmoil there, that they are getting very much afraid that I may be coming, so I told the journalist that yes, I am coming; tell them get ready. But I am not going anywhere. I am going to be here and fight the American idiots who are destroying democracy and all human values for which America stands. It is a very strange situation. I, I am fighting for the American Constitution, American values, against the Americans. But this will expose America to the whole world. That is their fear. And I'm not going anywhere.\nQ: QUESTION ON THE JOKING: YOU'VE RATTLED SO MANY PEOPLE'S CAGES BY SAYING, \"OH, WELL MAYBE I'LL GO TO AUSTRALIA.\" OR OH, YES, I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.\"\nA: Yes.\nQ: DO YOU AND SHEELA SIT DOWN AND SAY, \"OK, LET'S FRIGHTEN AUSTRALIA THIS WEEK,\" OR IS IT...\nA: No, it is spontaneous. There is no need. Because we are absolutely nonserious about it. In Joke, everything is allowed. There is no problem.\nQ: THE CONSTITUTION OFFERS FREEDOM OF RELIGION. IT SEEMS THAT WHAT YOU ARE OFFERING IS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION.\nA: Certainly\nQ: SO, HOW DO YOU COUNSEL PEOPLE TO PURSUE THAT? IS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION POSSIBLE?\nA: It is possible, and should be made possible, because religion has dominated people, exploited people, kept poverty in the world. Religion has committed so many crimes that it is time we should be finished with it... Jesus says, \"Blessed are the poor.\" The same is the tone of Buddha, the same is the preaching if Mahavira.\nThey all are consoling the poor people that you will inherit the kingdom of God. Marx was right only on one point in his all writings: that religion has been the opium of the people. And I agree with him only on that point. It has been the opium! They have drugged people to remain poor... Even in a country like America which has all riches -- the richest country -- there are thirty million people suffering from poverty. Thirty million people are suffering from poverty, and Ronald Regan goes on piling up on nuclear weapons. And there is no point in having more nuclear weapons, because both Soviet Russia and America combined have enough nuclear weapons to destroy humanity seven hundred times. So what is the point now? Nuclear weapons have made war absolutely obsolete. It is meaningless. The whole meaning of war is to win. Now there will be no winner and nobody defeated. The whole of life will be finished. So now war is against life and in favor of death. It is not a question if American democracy or Russian communism, it is a question of whether life has to exist on the earth or not. Thirty million people in your own country are starving on the streets, and you are preparing for war. And you are already equipped too much. But the politicians are not interested; in fact they want poor people because they can always be purchased. The religious people want poor people because they can be easily converted. That is what Christianity is doing all over the world. Islam used to do it -- in one hand the sword, in the other hand the Koran. You can choose: either the Koran, or the sword will behead you. Christianity has changed its techniques. In the one hand the Bible, in the other bread and butter. A little bit nicer, but the inner game is the same.\nIn India, I tried to find out whether any rich person has ever been converted to Christianity: I could not find a single case. Those who are converted to Christianity are orphans, beggars, poor people, starving people. Now, naturally the catholic pope and his bishops and the whole army of their priests would like that abortion should not be legal, because if it becomes legal, Catholics will be less in number -- where are they going to find orphans. Birth control should not be allowed, it is against God; population should be allowed to grow as people become more and more poor. And that means more customers for Christianity.\nQ: MANY PEOPLE BECOME RELIGIOUS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY NEED A CHURCH TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM. AND IF THAT IS TRUE, HOW COULD THESE RELIGIONS EVER BE ABOLISHED WHEN IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THEM?\nA: In fact, this is a very vicious circle. Religions teach every child as the child is born, immediately religions catch hold if it -- either Hindu or Mohammedan or Christian. And they start making him feel that he is not capable of deciding for himself, that he has to depend on those who know. That he has to listen to the parents, that he has to listen to teachers, that he has to listen to the priest. They make children slowly dependent, and those children lose their sense of strength, their being, and then naturally they want on everything to be advised and commanded, to be ordered. They can function only if they are ordered. If they are nit ordered, they are in confusion. They are always in search of a father figure. It is not strange that they call the Christian priest father: It is not strange that God is called the father. There is simple psychology behind it. They need a father figure; but I am saying it is a vicious circle. Religions create it and then they say people need guidance. Nobody needs guidance. I have people here -- five thousand people are here, one million sannyasins are around the earth -- none if them needs any guidance. None of them is dependent on anybody else. If one million people can depend on themselves and take the sole responsibility for themselves, because I am not their father -- I as not even their uncle! And I Am not their leader; because I cannot humiliate a person by forcing him to follow me. I am just a friend, not more than that. I can talk to these people. It is up to them to decide for or against. I am not asking them to believe in me. And all the religions have done that; that's why they are called faiths. I am against faith. My whole approach is unless you know it, never believe anything. And the beauty us that when you know, there is no need to believe -- you know it. Belief is always for the ignorant. Faith is always for those who are not courageous enough to enquire. I teach doubt; I teach skepticism; I teach enquiry. And a person has to remain in the state of not knowing until he comes to know. Belief covers his ignorance. You do not know about God, you do not know about what happens after death. Naturally, you start believing in somebody who pretends to know.\nNeither your popes know about it; nor Jesus Christ knew about it. Even on the cross, he shouted toward the sky: \"God have You forsaken me?\" He was a believer -- just illiterate, uneducated. And the people who were following him were also of the same grade, third rate. Those third-rate people became apostles of Christianity -- carpenters, woodcutters, fishermen. Not a single rabbi was a follower of Jesus Christ, and the whole Judea was full of learned rabbis. What does it show? It simply show that Jesus appeal is only for the very ignorant, and those ignorant people want to cover their ignorance, they are ready to believe. You will find totally different kind of people around me. You will not find ignorant people, you will not find illiterate people; you will find people who are almost all graduates from universities, have master's degrees, have Ph. D.s, D.Litts. Most of them are highly qualified professionals: psychologists, professors, doctors. You cannot enforce these people to believe. They have come to me because everywhere they are being indoctrinated and their intelligence was in rebellion. Here they have found a place where no indoctrination is happening. I don't have any doctrine to teach; I don't have any program to give. I only deprogram people and leave them to themselves. Now find you way, be courageous and go into the unknown.\nQ: HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM THEY'VE MADE THE DESERT FLOWER. THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS WITH THE MORMONS SETTLING IN UTAH, THE JEWS IN ISRAEL; AND THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY SEPARATES ORGANIZED RELIGIONS FROM CULTS, IS JUST TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT. DO YOU SEE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE RAJNEESHEES AND...?\nA: No! How many Rolls Royces do the Mormons have? (Laughter) In a five thousand member community we have ninety Rolls Royces, hundreds of other cars, one hundred buses, five planes, the city centrally air-conditioned. Why these people can...?\nQ: WELL, YOU HAVE ROLLS ROYCES, THEY HAD WIVES.\nA: They cannot have many more wives that we can have. We can defeat anybody. And just look at my commune women. You will not find more juicy women anywhere else. They are just gorgeous!\nQ: THE PRECAUTIONS THE COMMUNE HAS TAKEN AGAINST AIDS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FOREMOST EFFORTS WORLD-WIDE TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. HOW DID YOU FIRST BECOME AWARE OF IT AND RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THAT ILLNESS?\nA: I have a medical center here. We have the best doctors possible -- from all over the world, not only from Oregon -- we have FRCS from England, and they are\ncontinuously watching about everything, so that our commune can be protected from any kind of attack. And AIDS is going to be the most tremendous disease that man has ever seen. So it is their research on it, and if they feel there is something I should know they inform me.\nAnd soon we are going to do something about it. We will be the first in the whole world to do something; right now what is being done is that every government is trying to suppress the information about it, because no government want the world to know how many AIDS patients they have. The Oregon government has made such a test that ninety percent of AIDS patients will pass through it. This is simply criminal, because those ninety people that you have passed and cleared will be spreading the disease; and the disease is such that even by kissing you can give it to another person. It is not necessary that you should make some sexual contact -- just by kissing. Saliva is the carrier. I have told my people to stop kissing, instead of it, rubbing your noses against each other and enjoy it. And, in fact, these are people -- Eskimos do it already. They are five thousand years backwards, but as far as AIDS is concerned, they are far more superior than us. It is not that they don't know about kissing -- they have seen missionaries kissing, and they laugh at it that what kind of dirty people are these? Because kissing is simply laughed at. They have their ways -- and man is no inventive -- they rub noses, they rub each others' ear lobes. And these are all erotic points, and the women is so erotic her whole body is erotic. There is no need to put her in danger. In India, you will be surprised to know that the ordinary posture of making love -- man on top of woman -- is known as \"missionary posture,\" because it was the first Christian missionaries who were seen in that posture. Otherwise in India it was insulting. A woman who is softer, more fragile, and a huge animal is doing push ups on the poor woman.\nQ: THERE WERE THOSE CHARGES FILED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO REGARDING YOUR CHILDREARING TACTICS HERE IN THE COMMUNE. COULD YOU JUST BRIEFLY DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE?\nA: That is absolutely wrong, and the court has completely cleaned us. The charges were invalid. And now we are going to sue the woman who had put the case for child abuse. She has never been here; she know nothing about what is happening here to the children -- and she puts a case against us. And now she is defeated. This is insulting and disgusting. There is no abuse. Our children are the ones who cannot be abused. In the outside world, children can be abused, are abused. Here it is impossible because we are giving them all the information about sex -- not in a roundabout way. We are giving them actual facts -- that these are the facts of sex and these are the effects of sex, and until you are sexually mature don't get involved in any relationship which will destroy your whole life, may make you retarded, may make you perverted. And when you are of age, the medical center provides every contraceptive, pills. We don't prevent\nthem, but first let them be ready. If a boy is fourteen and has the energy now to make love -- he has the greatest power to make love between fourteen and twenty-one, and that is the time which is wasted in universities. After that, he is on decline. By the time he gets married after his Ph. D, he will be twenty-eight, twenty-seven; he has already declined. By thirty-five he is becoming older, he loses interest, he make love but he is a spent cartridge.\nQ: I PEERED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND WATCHED AS YOUR CAR ARRIVED, AND YOU DANCED WITH YOUR SANNYASINS. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES, WHAT DO YOU SEE ON THEIR FACES?\nA: Just love and nothing else. Great love and great gratitude. I don't think anybody has been loved so much as I have been loved. Jesus has only twelve disciples -- I have one million; and out of one million, ninety percent are women. So it is really groovey.\nQ: ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH?\nA: Death it not the end of life, it is the culmination of life. It is one of the most beautiful experiences. If you have really loved then only will you experience the beauty of death; if you missed life itself in listening to the sermons in the churches, in reading the Bible, and all kinds of nonsense... if you have missed life itself, you will die in a coma. Before death comes you will become unconscious, so you will miss the experience of death. The people who are living consciously -- and that is my basic teaching, live consciously every moment. Even while making love, remain conscious and a witness. It is a life... long growth if becoming alert. Then you can die consciously and you can experience death as the ultimate orgasm. It is far bigger than any sexual orgasm. In fact, the difference is not only of quantity, the difference is of quality. It is immeasurable. Living moment to moment, one learns how to die. beautifully, silently, joyously. One is going on another adventure. Unknown -- I don't give them any ideas what is going to happen after death, because that is absolutely wrong, destroying. it is like if I loved a movie and I tell you the whole story of the movie, and then tell you that I have brought a ticket for you, go and see. I have destroyed it already; what is the point of seeing it? I give them the ticket, but I don't tell them what is going to happen. That they have to discover on their own. It is tremendously beautiful because I have lived before and I have died before, and I have died consciously so I know what beauty it is. It is not the end; it is always a new beginning.\nIn existence nothing dies -- it cannot. You cannot destroy even a small pebble. You can grind it, but it will be there. Now in powder form. You can throw the powder into the ocean. It will be there, resting somewhere in the bottom of the ocean, but now it is an accepted scientific truth that nothing can be destroyed,\nyou can only change its form. And if this is so about matter, what to say about consciousness? -- Which is the highest evolution on the earth. Existence cannot be so stupid, so unintelligent to destroy consciousness -- it does not destroy even stones, how it can destroy your soul? But I don't say to anybody believe in me. I say experiment; and right now you are alive, so don't bother about death. When it comes, it comes. Right now you experiment with life, and be ready: death can come any moment. And particularly in these days where politicians are preparing to destroy the whole humanity, and religions have contributed their contribution through AIDS. That will destroy if politicians cannot, then AIDS will destroy humanity. So we are really living without any tomorrow. Always man has lived without tomorrow, but never with such a crisis. And I say AIDS is a religious disease because its beginning is in homosexuality, and homosexuality was born in monasteries of religions because there they segregated men and women and they did not allow men and women to meet. No women can enter in a monastery where only men live; neither men can go into the nunnery. You are creating the situation for homosexuality. Religions have been teaching for celibacy -- which creates perversions because it is unnatural. It is just as if somebody says to you that unless you stop urinating you will not enter into the kingdom of God. That is just nonsense! But you can find a few idiots who will start making an effort, because if this is the price, they are ready to do it. But what they will do -- they will pretend, they will be hypocrites, and they will find perverted ways from the back door. You cannot go against nature: celibacy is against nature. And all the religions have been preaching celibacy. They are responsible for AIDS. So today the situation is really more dangerous than it has ever been. Tomorrow is more uncertain than it has ever been. So live today with intensity, with totality, with as much consciousness as possible. And I have here one hundred and twelve methods how to increase your consciousness. So if death comes tomorrow, there is no problem -- there will be only my people dying joyously with a smile on their face.\nQ: AT YOUR NEWS CONFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU INVITED SOMEONE TO ASSASSINATE YOU. IS IT A JOKE? IS IT FEAR OF DEATH BY NATURAL CAUSES, OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL WAY YOU COULD SEE THE END OF YOUR LIFE?\nA: Most probably, that will be the logical end of my life. It is a serious joke. And I would prefer it that way, rather than dying on the bed. Ninety-nine percent of people do that. I don't want to belong to that crowd! I would rather like to be assassinated than to die on my bed. And to me there is no problem. I have experienced life. I have tasted all its joys. There is nothing that I have missed. If death come this moment, I will not ask even one more moment to complete my sentence. It is perfectly Okay. In existence, nothing is ever completed. Only in novels, stories begin and end. In life there is no beginning and there is no end.\nAbruptly things start and abruptly things finish. There is no preface, there is no appendix, there are no footnotes, nothing. It is always in the middle that the story begins. When I used to read -- for five years I have not been reading anything -- but I loved reading so much that I have to find out ways to make the book more interesting. I would begin in the middle, then go to the end, then come to the beginning. And that was more hilarious, gave more suspense. Life is really hilarious. Just you have to know how to love it. We don't have any God, we don't have any heaven and hell. We have only this moment, so we can pour all our energies into it. And we are doing that. We are celebrating and enjoying and loving and laughing and dancing. In fact, that is what creates hostility toward me. The poor is hostile toward the rich; the sad people are hostile towards those who can laugh and love and dance. The whole world lives in such misery and suffering that they cannot tolerate me. My existence and my people's existence proves them wrong -- and I am not a person just to argue. I give existential argument: my commune is an existential argument to the whole world that you also could have loved and danced and sung and enjoyed, but you have chosen wrong paths, so you go to church, you go to the synagogue. My people don't go there. There is no need for them to anywhere. They don't pray. They are not beggars. And to whom to pray? There is nobody in the sky to pray to. My people meditate. They sit silently doing nothing, they enter into their own silence, enjoy it. The more you enjoy it the deeper and deeper you enter into it. There come a point where you are exactly at your center of being. And that's what I call enlightenment: a great explosion of luminosity, clarity. All questions disappearing, all doubts dissolved, you have found the answer. The answer is within you -- nobody can supply it. And all these prophets and messiahs have been doing just that: they are suppling you the answer. And borrowed answer is not going to help. Those borrowed answers have made the whole humanity miserable. They have taken their enquiry, they have taken everything away from the people and left them utterly poor. My people are multidimensionally rich.\nQ:SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU DIE, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RAJNEESHEES?\nA: They will celebrate my death.\nQ: AND THEN GO TO THE FOUR WINDS, OR STAY TOGETHER...?\nA: That is for them to decide what to do. I am not to decide. Remember, that is the strategy of a politician: he want to even control people after his death. The religious leaders declare their successors, but what is the point in it? The point is dead over-ruling the living... When I am gone, I am gone. And it is a double thing to be understood: when I am gone, I am gone to you -- you are gone to me. I will be doing whatsoever I want to do; you should do whatsoever you want to\ndo. Nobody has to control. You cannot control me when I am dead. You cannot tell me what I should do after death. Neither will I say to anybody. I have made you love life, relish every moment. You know the secret. You will not miss me; you don't need any successor. You are my successor -- everyone individually. If you still decide to remain together -- good; if you want to go separate on your own ways, that is even better. But I am not going to dominate you, either alive or dead. To dominate anybody in any way is criminal.\nQ: WHAT WILL RAJNEESHPURAM LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS? OR WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS?\nA: Nothing -- I never think about the future. Future is not my concern at all. To me, time is only now, and space is only here: beyond that I have no concern. While I am here, I love my people making a desert into an oasis. When I am gone, these people will be here. These are intelligent people, they don't need any instructions. Even now I am not giving them any instructions. They can understand. They know that I love greenery, so they started planting as manu trees possible. They know I love water, so they have made dams, lakes. They love me -- from my shoes up to my hat they make everything for me. I never think about the future. That's why my life is without any tensions -- I never think about the past, so I am not burdened with the past. I never imagine about the future, so I'm not worried about the future. And today is enough unto itself. I enjoy it. When I go to bed, I thank the whole existence that it has been beautiful today, and if by chance I wake up again, we will see.\nQ: YOU MADE THE COMMENT THAT THERE CAN NEVER BE PEACE BETWEEN OREGONIANS AND RAJNEESHEES. WHY IS THAT? DO YOU NOT WANT PEACE?\nA: I always love peace, but what I had said actually has been misunderstood and it was bound to be because the question was asked, it was not about peace, it was about coexistence. And I said: \"Never.\" Because coexistence is an ugly word, political; it means you are you are an enemy, I am hostile, I am an enemy, but what to do -- we have to live. I am here, you are here, and we have to live somehow, so some compromise is needed. That is coexistence. I don't believe in coexistence. Either I will turn Oregon red, or they are free to turn us into Oregonians. That is peace, not coexistence: One existence. Till that happens, the fight will continue.\nQ: WHAT IF OREGONIANS DECIDED JUST TO LEAVE RAJNEESHEES ALONE?\nA: I don't think everybody can leave Rajneeshees to live alone we won't allow that!\nQ: THE MOST OPEN WOUND IN THE STATE WAS WHEN THE RAJNEESHEES WON THE ELECTION IN WHAT WAS THEN ANTELOPE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS LEGAL, PEOPLE FELT IT WAS A TAKE-OVER. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE RAJNEESHEES WOULD EVER PULL OUT OF THE CITY OF RAJNEESH?\nA: There is no way, because they are absolutely wrong and we cannot compromise with anything wrong. It is simple democratic process that sannyasins are the majority, and whoever is the majority will rule. If they want to rule, they should create a majority and they can have the rule. There is not problem in it. And one should not be so ugly in behaviour that you don't want to be ruled by the majority, and the minority wants to rule the majority. It is not a take-over. Otherwise, Ronald Reagan has taken over America. If majority supports, then that's a democratic process. And it is not a small majority. There are not more than one dozen people in the dead Antelope, and there are hundreds of sannyasins there. They can bring more people if they want; otherwise, we are going to bring more people.\nQ: WILL YOU AND RAJNEESHEES GET INVOLVED IN THE OREGON POLITICAL SYSTEM YOU SO DESPISE, RUN FOR OFFICE?\nA: No. There is no political problem for us, and we are not involved in any way with the politics. The sannyasins who are living in Antelope, they were being tortured by the minority. For small legal things that they wanted, they were not allowed. The minority should have thought about it -- it was such a simple thing\n-- that they were denying the majority things which they legally asked. They are not asking any illegal thing. If they want to make a house, permit will not be given; if they want to purchase a land, permit will not be given. On what grounds? Their children will not be admitted in the school. On what ground? A minority torturing a majority -- that is democracy? And since we have come there, nobody can complain that we have harassed any Oregonian? We invited them they gave taken their children out of school. And still you think that there should be some peace! And many of them have already left; and the others who are still hanging are hanging because there is nobody else except us to purchase their properties, so they can leave. If they cannot be with us, there is no reason for them to be there; but we are going to be there.\nQ: CAN WE EXPECT PEOPLE IN RAJNEESHPURAM TO BE RUNNING FOR THE STATE HOUSE OR THE STATE SENATE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS?\nA: No. We are not interested in politics. Our interests are our own comforts -- our houses, our lands -- we wanted more lands, we wanted more houses. Our interest was not politics at all; nobody is running for Assembly... You have many idiots to do that in the State, you need not...\nQ: YOU'VE RECEIVED SO MUCH OPPOSITION FROM THE POLITICAL ARENA THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE BEATEN THEN AT THEIR OWN GAME BEFORE.\nA: No. But if sometimes the need arises, we will do everything to beat them on their own grounds. But we are a small minority, and the majority of millions of people in Oregon is threatened by us -- this is something ridiculous. We should be threatened by them, we are not; they are threatened by us which is simply absurd. That's why I say I have known people from all the countries of the world, but Oregon seems to be special. It seems all the idiots of the world go on being born in Oregon. Strange! For example, they are unnecessarily harassing us. That's what they did in Antelope. If they had not harassed our people, we were not interested in making a mayor or a council. Why we should bother about all that? We are not interested in power or prestige. In fact, it was so difficult for our people to persuade somebody to be mayor, to persuade somebody to be the councillor -- nobody wants. Who wants to get that sort of job? There are so many groovy things going around, and the poor mayor is sitting in the town hall having a meeting about unnecessary things... We are not interested, but if they harass us too much, we can do anything. We will fight in every possible way. We do not want to harass anybody and we do not want to be harassed by anybody. We are harmless people, we will not do any harm to anybody; but if somebody does harm to us, then we are not Christians -- we are not going to follow Jesus Christ that when somebody hits on you cheek, give him the other cheek. To me that is insulting the other person who as hit you. It is making him subhuman. You are becoming holier than thou. No. We are just human being and we respect you. If you hit me on one cheek, I will hit you your both cheeks immediately. I just respect you as a human being. You needed it, you deserved it, you earned it. There is a story in Buddha's life. He said in one sermon that you should forgive a person seven times. One of his disciples stood up and asked, what about the eighth time?\nReasonable question. Buddha was at a loss for a moment. He had never expected that somebody would ask about the eighth time, so he said, OK, Make it seventy- seven. But the man stood up again and he said it makes no difference. What about the seventy-eighth time? I have heard one story of a Christian saint who was hit on one of his cheeks. Obviously, being a follower of Jesus, he gave his other cheek, but the man was also some man of guts -- he hit on the other cheek even more forcibly. And at that moment the saint jumped on the man, clutched his neck and told that now I am going to kill you. But the man said wait, you a\nsaint and your master has said that give the other cheek. He said: OK, I followed the master, I gave you the other cheek, but now I have no other cheek. Now I am free. And I will teach you a lesson. If they go on harassing us, we enjoy it, so there is nothing serious in it; but we will harass them in our own way.\nQ: BUT YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR?\nA: No we don't need. We don't need; it is far better to harass the governor than to put our governor and then that governor is being harassed by Oregonians. No. We will do this way; Let the governor be theirs, we will harass him. And we are enjoying the whole game. If they can understand a little sense of humor, all the clouds can disappear within a second. From our side there is no problem at all. Ok? Good\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #29 Chapter title: None 15 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH BHASKAR, CORREO BRASILIENSE, BRASILIA, BRAZIL\nQUESTION:* BHAGWAN, I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS MOMENT. BRAZIL'S A VERY POOR COUNTRY. SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING MISERY. THERE IS NO FOOD, NO HOUSING, NO EDUCATION. BUT THEY HAVE THREE HOPES: TO WIN AT THE LOTTERY, TO BE SAVED BY GOD, OR TO MAKE A POLITICAL REVOLUTION.\nTHERE IS A VERY POPULAR EXPRESSION IN BRAZIL WHICH SAYS, \"GOD IS BRAZILIAN.\" DO YOU THINK SO?\nANSWER:* God must be Brazilian, but it is very unfortunate, because only poor people, suffering people need a God.\nGod is just opium. You can take the opium and forget your suffering your misery, your poverty. So, the more a country is poor, more it sill be addicted with God. It is the same proportion always. So the more a country is poor, the more it will be addicted to God. It is the same proportion always. More the country is happy, contented, comfortable, who bothers about God? For what?\nEven in the ordinary life of a man, one remembers God only when he is in misery, suffering, trouble, sick, bankrupt. When everything is going great, nobody remembers God; there is no need. God is the need of the suffering, downtrodden.\nSo perhaps, if you say seventy percent of Brazilians are without food, without houses, then God must be a Brazilian.\nGod is the property of the poor, the hope of those who are living a hopeless life. And they will continue to live in poverty until they get rid of this God. So tell the Brazilians he is a Brazilian, so it is our duty to finish him.\nOnce God is finished from the world, man need not suffer, for the simple reason, then we start functioning intelligently.\nThere is no need for poverty, there is no need for misery, there is no need for so much sickness. There is no need for man only to live seventy years. These are just because we have not tried intelligence in living. Wherever we have tried it, we have reached heights of immense dimensions.\nOnly as far as man is concerned, we are dependent on God.\nIt is only three hundred years since science came into being. It revolted against the world and all kinds of superstitions. And within three hundred years science has given man so much that in thirty thousand years, religions have not been able to provide. And this too, against the priests, against the politicians, science has contributed. If politicians and priests are not there, man can take a quantum leap.\nThere is no barrier between man and paradise. But the priest wants people to be poor, because only the poor need him. It is a simple business ideology. The politician wants people poor, because only the poor can be conditioned. They are illiterate, uneducated, and they are so much in suffering that any hope and they are ready to buy it. It may be God, it may be communism, it may be revolution -- something in the future, faraway. The poor are ready to buy it.\nThe politicians have been selling hope for thousands of years. The priests have been selling hope, and it is really strange that after such a long time they are still doing good business. And man seems to be fast asleep, without looking at the whole strategy.\nThe priests and the politicians have to disappear from the earth. Only then the new man -- rich, comfortable, skillful, creative -- can come into being.\nSo it is Brazilians' duty to kill God. He must be there.\nIt is the duty of the poor people of the world to kill God. The rich people would like him to survive. For the rich people God is a beautiful investment, because God creates a buffer between the rich and the poor. And because of that buffer the rich are protected. Remove the buffer and the rich and all their exploitation will be exposed. And then no priest can go on befooling the poor in the name of God, in the name of fate, in the name of the law of action, past lives. All kinds of things have been invented just to keep the poor poor, ready to be sucked by all kinds of parasites.\nAnd the poor man has lived in poverty for so long that he has become accustomed to it. He accepts it as his life. He does not know what life is, so he cannot think that he is missing something. To miss something, first you have to have it.\nAnd that's the function of my communes. In every country I want my communes to live as richly, abundantly, contented, joyously, without God, without heaven, without hell, without politicians, with out priests, and prove to the world that people can live without all this nonsense! And they are living far more beautifully than anybody else.\nNobody on the earth is singing a song of joy. Nobody on the earth is in a state to dance.\nWe have to create these oases in the whole desert of the earth, so people at least can see the possibility. They can also be part of this ecstasy, this pilgrimage.\nFirst, they will be hostile, because it hurts the ego to see that others have attained, and you have failed. So the first reaction is that the others are pretending. Their laughter is just a makeup. Their joy, their dance is just show-business.\nBut how long can you befool yourself by finding such explanations?\nPeople cannot go on working for twelve hours, fourteen hours a day, and still be able to laugh, enjoy, dance, love. Sooner or later the outside people are bound to be attracted to our communes.\nOur communes have to become finally, a kind of university where we teach -- not three r's, but three l's: love, life, laughter.\nAnd there is no other hope for the poor. Revolution has failed.\nIn Russia, the politicians were giving them the hope that after the revolution everything will be paradise. Sixty years have passed, there is no sign of any paradise. Of course, one thing has happened: they have distributed poverty equally. And they don't allow Russian people to come in contact with the rich countries, for the simple fear that if they can see how richly, intensely and totally people are living, then this communism has failed. It could not make them rich, it has only made them all poor -- equally poor.\nSo equality has been achieved. The classes have not disappeared. Their names have changed. It was the bourgeois class and the proletariat -- the poor and the rich. Now it is the ordinary citizen and the member of the communist party.\nThe member of the communist party has more power than any rich man ever had, is using all luxuries for himself that any rich man ever had, is living comfortably with all technological devices at his hand. And it is only in Russia, that to become a member of the communist party is the most difficult. In any other country, you can just become the member if you want -- any moment. No qualifications, no conditions have to be fulfilled.\nBut in Russia, to become a member of the communist party is a long process, a long discipline -- far longer than a poor man has to travel to become rich. The distance between the hierarchy that is in power and the people is bigger in Russia than anywhere else, for the simple reason, that the middle class has completely disappeared and it has left a big gap.\nIn other societies, the society is divided, not only in two classes -- about that Marx is absolutely wrong. Society is divided into many steps. Those two may be the extreme steps -- the poorest and the richest, but there are in between both, many classes. So there is a link.\nAnd the middle class is the biggest class, because on one hand it joins the poor, on the other hand it joins the superrich.\nIn Russia the middle class has disappeared, because the rich are no more there. So the rich and the middle class both have been reduced to the proletariat. Poverty is so equal that you don't feel hurt, you don't feel jealous. There is nothing to feel jealous of, everybody is just like you.\nGod has failed. Marx has failed. And I don't give any hope. Naturally I cannot fail. They were all giving hope, they could not fulfill the hopes. I am not giving you any hope. On the contrary, I am taking away all your hopes, all your future, so that you can live in this moment. Even if you have not much to live, still one can make this moment a paradise by small things.\nAnd if the whole humanity is convinced that this is the only moment to live, the misers will disappear on their own accord -- because they are not living, they are accumulating for the future. The monks and the nuns will disappear, because they are not living in the moment; they are living for some heaven, some paradise somewhere.\nSo the basic thing today is, that God -- which is another name of hope, revolution\n-- which is a materialistic name for God... But they function exactly the same. Their function is to keep people intoxicated.\nMy work is to wake people and stop taking all these opiums.\nIf people are just a little bit awakened, we can disperse all nations, all nuclear weapons, all atomic plants -- which are simply wasting energy. And the same energy can become creative and make people as rich as no Alexander the Great was ever rich.\nThe clothes that I am wearing, no emperor in the past could have used them. And I am a poor man! It was simply impossible, because the technology was not there.\nWe can make the whole earth full of emperors living better than Ashoka, Akbara, Alexander, Napoleon -- in every possible way.\nI don't see any problem, except the mind of the poor itself -- which is so conditioned that it still goes on believing in God, who has never answered any prayer, who goes on believing in paradise. If God was so compassionate, he would have given you paradise here. Why after death? Why not before death?\nAnd the poor people have to see the fact that all the revolutions have failed. The French Revolution failed, the Russian Revolution failed, the Chinese Revolution failed. They were bound to fail, because the revolutionaries who were going to take over the power will become the power elite, and the society will be still divided.\nAnd these power elites will be more dangerous than the rich people of the old. For the simple reason, in countries like Russia and China, you cannot create another revolution, because the revolutionaries who have taken over the power know how it has been taken over, so they have prevented all possibilities. Even to talk about revolution is enough to be persecuted, killed, or exiled into Siberia. Even if Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, or Lenin himself, were to be born into Russia, there is no possibility that their books would be published. Only government has the publication department. Anything that is published is published by the government, approved by the communist party.\nAnd Marx would not have been allowed to sit in the British Museum the whole day doing nothing but reading and taking notes. His whole life he never did anything, except reading and writing. His writings are voluminous. But in Russia that is not possible. He will not be counted as a proletariat.\nOne of my friends was visiting Russia -- he is a Buddhist bhikku, a follower of Buddha, a monk.\nHe told me, \"The first thing that was shocking to the Russians were my hands.\"\nI said, \"Your hands?\"\nHe said, \"Yes. Whenever I shook hands with them, they immediately shrank back. And they said, `You must be a bourgeois. Your hands don't show that you have ever worked.\"'\nI told the Buddhist monk, \"You touch my hand. Then you will know that you are a proletariat and I am a bourgeois! That will give you great consolation.\"\nMarx would not have been possible. No revolution in Russia is possible. Everything has failed that man has done up to now, for the simple reason that man does not change his conditioning and goes on doing things with the same conditioned mind.\nAll that is needed is a simple deprogramming. Your mind should be cleaned from being a Brazilian, from being an American, from being an Indian, from being a communist, from being a socialist, from being a Christian, Jew, Hindu -- whatever the name of your limitations. All those limitations should be dropped, so you can become an unlimited being.\nThat is freedom, and that is true revolution, and it is an individual affair.\nSo take my message to Brazil, \"please stop hoping, and start living! Out of your living there is hope. Out of your hoping there is only death and nothing else.\"\nQ: BHAGWAN, TODAY, BRAZIL HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF AIDS IN THE WORLD. DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A MEDICINE AGAINST AIDS? AND WHY ARE THE GAYS MORE SENSITIVE TO AIDS?\nA:* First, the homosexuals have created the disease AIDS. It is a homosexual contribution to humanity. Then it can spread to heterosexuals, but the source of the disease is homosexuality.\nFew things will have to be understood. One, homosexuality is not the way of nature, not the way of existence.\nExistence always wants the opposite polarities to meet. Then only you can create a better generation. Homosexuality is uncreative, and homosexuality is between two men, two women. There is no polarity, there is no tension, no challenge.\nFirst, people started becoming homosexuals in monasteries, soldier camps, school hostels, university hostels -- wherever man was separated from women. It was going to happen.\nBiology knows nothing about your moralities. By the time a boy is fourteen, he is capable of giving birth to a child. The same is true about the girl. But in all the societies, this is the time when their sex is repressed, and this is also the time when their sex energy is at its climax -- between fourteen and twenty-one. Nearabout eighteen you have your peak sexual energy, which you will never have again.\nIt seems all societies have conspired that man should not know the blissfulness of orgasmic experience. This was a beautiful way to divert: that he has to be\neducated first, he has to go to the university. And by the time he is back from the university -- he may be twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight -- he is already on the decline. He has lost the time when he could have attained orgasmic experience. Now he can only experience ejaculation.\nThat proves to the religious people that it is sheer wastage of energy, you don't get anything. And after making love, a man feels frustrated, nothing comes out of it. He has lost the right timing. The society has diverted him.\nIf we want a more joyous world, the best thing will be that between fourteen and twenty-one, all girls and all boys are given birth control methods and total freedom to mix with many boys, with many girls, because you will never have this energy again. It is lost, then it is lost forever. Then you will have to wait for next life. That is why everybody is waiting for the next life, because they have missed something very essential in this life. They may not be aware of it. Perhaps they are not aware, but there is a wound inside. Something that could have blossomed in them has not blossomed. That's why there is so much despair.\nAnd then all the religions are teaching celibacy. First, they prevent the best time to know the secrets and mysteries of sex, and then they impose the idea of celibacy, that it is very spiritual. It is simply against nature, against your biology. The monks in the monasteries of all the religions, have been the first to find homosexuality. And the disease is basically homosexual, because nature never forgives. You have to follow the law.\nIf you put your hand into the fire, you are going to be burned.\nNature simply goes on its way. There is no question that you are a saint, so you will not be burned, you are a celibate so you will not be burned, only the sinners will be burned -- that is stupidity. Everybody is going to be burned who puts his hand into the fire.\nThe law of nature is impartial, accepts no exception. And anybody who goes against nature, sooner or later will have to suffer for it.\nHomosexuality was the greatest crime against nature.\nFew things to be understood before you can understand why AIDS evolved out of it.\nIn ancient China, it was a common practice if an emperor was getting old and his people did not want him to die, the method that was used to prolong his life was not a medicine. It was two beautiful young girls who will be lying on both of his sides in the night. And strange as it may seem, it has worked for thousands of years in China. Finding himself between two beautiful girls, he again becomes psychologically young. A great lust for life arises in him. He would like to be young again. Playing with those girls, there are moments when he forgets that he is old. And the life of emperors in China has been the longest of any emperor in the whole world. This was the medicine. @B003\nI mention it so that I can explain what is happening to the homosexuals. Because they are both men, their energies don't have any tension, their energies don't\nhave any challenge, their energies by and by start losing the will to live. For what? There is no challenge. They start losing the desire to live.\nThey may not be conscious of it. Just as the Chinese emperors started feeling a tremendous desire to live more, perhaps forever-life is so beautiful it is not worth losing great lust arises in them. That lust gives you energy. That lust provokes all your stagnant forces into functioning.\nYou can see it happen to a man who suddenly falls in love with a woman and you meet him on the road. You met him yesterday, too, but you can see the difference. The man is looking radiant. His walk has a dance in it. He is whistling. And this man used to walk the street as if he were dragging himself against his will because he has to reach his home. But today he is not walking, but running. because he has to reach the home -- the woman will be waiting there.\nSomething that was dormant in him has become dynamic. The homosexuals slowly, slowly go on losing their desire to live. and that is the basic cause of the disease called AIDS.\nIt is not a disease. If it was a disease, there would be a possibility of finding medicine for it. This is the most strange thing about it -- it is not a disease. Otherwise, it may take some time, but we will be able to find some medicine for it. But it is simply loss of the will to live. Now, what medicine can bring the will back?\nThe man really wants deep down to die. He has dropped all hopes to reach the bank. He is ready to be drowned any moment. He has given himself a life sentence. He has crucified himself.\nJesus only said everybody has to carry his cross on his own shoulders -- I wonder why he forgot that everybody has to crucify himself also. But people are doing that: carrying their cross on their shoulders, and then finally putting themselves on the cross.\nHomosexuality has to disappear if we want AIDS to be prevented. All homosexuals have to be taught again that the woman is something significant to their life. Her warmth is something significant to keep them alive.\nNow it is a well-established psychological fact that if a child is given every nourishment except the warmth of the body, blankets are given -- he is not kept in cold, he is warm; every food that is needed for his growth is given -- but there is no human touch anywhere. There is nobody to hug him, to hold him close to her chest, to her breasts where he can feel warmth, love.\nThey have tried with one child keeping scientifically perfectly healthy checking that nothing is going wrong, and another child is kept with the mother -- no check, nobody is bothered whether anything is going wrong or not. But the first child dies within three months. And this experiment has been first done on animals many times, and the same is the result: without the mother's warmth, the feminine warmth, the child perhaps never gets the will to live.\nThat is my explanation for the phenomenon. He never gets, in the very beginning, a desire to live. This is one side of the case which is now well established. Homosexuals cannot give to each other the warmth that they need. They need a feminine warmth.\nTwo women cannot give to each other the same quality of energy and love that a man can give to them. But it has to be understood that AIDS is not created by lesbians.\nThat too is very strange. Homosexuals have created AIDS, not lesbians. The reason is clear: a woman is always a receiving center, and man is always an assertive energy. Two women can live together without disturbing each other's life for the simple reason that they are not assertive agents. They are completely closed and alone . They can be together, but they will not affect each other.\nTwo men are both assertive. So when homosexuals are making love, they not are giving energy to each other which is not needed at all -- they both need feminine energy, feminine warmth.\nSo lesbians have no part in contributing Aids. I am sorry to say that on that point they have not proved equal to men.\nHomosexuality has to disappear from the world, and we can make it disappear, at least in our communes. It is just a question of understanding. And, because it is artificial, superficial, it can be easily removed.\nAnd precautions should be taken against AIDS because it is already rampant. This is not the beginning -- we are almost in the middle of it. The ind is not far away. It spreads like wildfire. And now they have come to find that even kissing can give it to you.\nLooks as though medical people will not be able to find any medicine for it. We have to find a way, and we can find a way. My own understanding is that in our communes slowly, slowly homosexuality should disappear. About lesbians we can take care later on -- it may not be giving AIDS, but it is ugly, unnatural. Perhaps someday it may bring something better than AIDS, nobody knows, because nobody knew about AIDS before and homosexuality has been in existence since religions have been in existence.\nIt took thousands of years to create the situation in which AIDS can happen. But to me it is not a disease -- it has nothing to do with medicine. Medicine and medical care can keep it from spreading, can keep the man who already has it, alive to the maximum -- that is two years... if he is completely isolated where no infection is possible.\nThat gives the clue to me: the AIDS patient loses all resistance power. His life energy has shrunk withinwards. The petals of his life energy are no more open -- they are closed, they are getting ready for the night. Hence, any infection can enter into his body.\nBecause his own will to live is not there, his body will not create the antibodies to prevent AIDS. In my communes I will suggest: First, try to help homosexuals turn into heterosexuals. Everybody in the commune should go to every possible\ntest, because we love each other so much that we would not like one of us to become the cause of the death of so many people. No sannyasin would like it.\nAnd we are not going to condemn, because he is simply a victim -- victim of Jesus Christ, victim of Mahavira, victim of Buddha, and those big criminals are no more there. Otherwise, they should be shot immediately. Fortunately, they are dead.\nSo help them -- these are victims of thousands of years of homosexuality. Respect them. Be loving to them and compassionate. And then each commune has to create a corner for them where they can live. And my idea is that a male AIDS patient should live with a female AIDS patient.\nPerhaps that may be the only medicine possible. I say perhaps because it has not been tried, and I am not a man of medicine. I am just crazy, and crazy ideas come to me. But when nothing is working, why not try a crazy man's idea?\nAll the sane people are saying there is nothing that can be done, so you are not going to lose anything except a madman's idea. My idea is that a woman and man -- both having AIDS so there is no question of giving AIDS to each other, or as much they can give, that is up to them, there is nothing more to it -- have come to the very end of the journey.\nBut my feeling is that the female energy and male energy meeting again may provoke the will to live. The warmth of a woman, the love of the man may postpone the date of their death.\nAnd this can be done only in my commune with my people, because they all understand each other. They would like to help each other. Here we are going to start... soon. And perhaps that may prove the only cure. If it is out of homosexuality that the disease is born, then something out of heterosexuality will be the medicine.\nThis is my simple logic.\nQ: BHAGWAN, YOUR SANNYASINS IN BRAZIL ARE TRYING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE SOME BEAUTIFUL SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY COULD LIVE TOGETHER, AND IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THEM?\nA: It is difficult?\nQ:YES. MY FEELING IS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE BUSINESS, TO MAKE A COMMUNE.\nA: You talk with Sheela and Savita about that. Some way can be found, and a commune can be created. Start on a small scale and slowly it can grow. And few businesses you can do very easily. And we can send you sannyasins from outside, all around the world to help you. For example, you can start publications. In Brazil, many of my books are published, but they are published\nby publishers. Somebody else is taking the profit out of them -- our sannyasins should publish them themselves. Just that will bring you good money.\nThere is no need to create huge palaces. Just workable houses, simple. For example, in India where poor people are in millions, in a village a beautiful hut can be made almost for nothing. This has been a tradition in Indian villages that whenever somebody is making a house, the whole village will help. And the houses are made with bamboos -- the bamboo functions as the wall -- cow dung mixed with mud is put on both sides of the bamboos, whitewashed it looks so clean, so beautiful. And just bamboos on the roof with mud tiles. For two hundred rupees, you can make a beautiful house. Two hundred rupees means, today, five dollars, or at the most ten dollars.\nBetween five to ten dollars, you can make a house. So when the situation is bad, then think of your local products-whether bamboo is available, other kinds of wood are available cheap -- and use that material. There is no need for marbles, and there is no need.… Yes, one day when you have money then have marble palaces, but meanwhile, till the palaces come, you need a certain kind of shelter that can be made very easily.\nNot difficult -- you can create a commune of five hundred people with small cottages. And you can start businesses. For example, publication you can start with your own press, your own editors, your own designers. And you can make it an art -- hand binding, hand stitching.\nAnd in fact you can sell in the market for a better price than book printed mass scale in a factory, because that will not have that beauty. And about other things you talk to Sheela and Savita. There is no problem which cannot be solved.\nBut Brazil needs a commune.\nQ: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT THE THIRD WORLD WAR. WE FEEL EACH DAY THE WAR COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER. IS THERE SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO PREVENT THE WAR?\nA: The truth is that the nuclear war is never going to happen. Even when I say it is coming closer and closer, the reason to say it is not that the war is coming closer and closer, the reason is to awaken you somehow that the war is coming so close now there is no time to waste -- get up as quickly as possible before the war finishes you.\nBut the third world war is impossible for the simple reason that both the nations America and the Soviet Union are equally balanced with nuclear weapons. And if a war starts, the whole point of a war is to win, but in a nuclear war nobody wins. So war has lost its basic foundation. Why should you fight when both are going to be finished in it?\nThe possibility of one becoming victorious and the other being defeated is no more there. So I say with nuclear war, war has reached to such totality that it has committed suicide. Now war is not possible -- I mean nuclear war is not possible.\nJust the other day I saw a petition of American scientists who had made the first nuclear war plant in America -- the pioneers of nuclear weapons. Fifty scientists have signed the petition to the president and to the Supreme Court that we are trembling with fear -- what we have done. And we have already so much nuclear weapons on both sides that they are enough to destroy all life from earth within ten minutes.\nThose fifty scientists who have been making nuclear war possible have visualized the situation that is happening. The same is happening in Russia -- the scientists are becoming aware that what they are creating is a mass scale world- wide suicide.\nIt is so absurd and meaningless. Those fifty scientists have mentioned one thing which I have been telling again and again: that up to now all our efforts to find some antidote for the nuclear weapon has failed. And we don't think that we will be able to find something that destroys the power of nuclear weapons -- no counter energy is available.\nIt is because of this fact they have put the petition because now it is simply destruction -- there is no way of protecting anybody. I am tremendously happy that nuclear weapons have come to a point where fighting becomes useless, war becomes utterly stupid. And even if seeing this stupidity the politicians decide to go for a nuclear war, then I think this earth deserves it.\nIf its leaders are ready to destroy it, then perhaps it is good we finished. The universe will go on -- it has been going on before this earth was born, it will go on with the same beauty and with the same splendor. It doesn't matter that the earth is gone. There are 50,000 planets exactly like this earth in the universe where life exists.\nSo if the situation for life to exist on this earth disappears, the bodies will be dead here and your souls will be transplanted into other planets. They don't need missiles, they don't need rockets, they can simply jump a quantum leap from this planet.\nBut as far as I am concerned, I am totally convinced that war is impossible for the simple reason that that's why they have been postponing it. And they will go on postponing it -- they want to find something, either party -- whoever finds it first will immediately go for nuclear war because he can protect his country and you cannot protect your country. Then war again gains meaning -- somebody will be victorious and somebody will be defeated.\nBut I don't see there is any way to find an antidote. For the simple reason that 300 years of continuous creation of war mechanisms, destructive weapons, has led to the nuclear weapon. You have never worked for life, you have never thought about how to create more beautiful life-healthier, intelligent, lengthier. If side by side you were working for these 300 years, putting your whole energy as you have been putting into war, perhaps you may be able to find an antidote -- but there is not time enough.\nIf all the scientists of the world together start working now, perhaps in one hundred years they may be able to find a clue which nullifies all nuclear weapons. That seems to be impossible.\nSo to me the third world war is over. We have passed it -- now think about the fourth. And prepare for the fourth. Third is not possible.\nAnd I am not a pacifist, and I don't want my sannyasins to be pacifists. A pacifist is against war; so much so that if he had nuclear weapons he will fight with nuclear weapons against war. A pacifist is not a peaceful man.\nOur sannyasins are not pacifists, but peace loving, silence loving, trying to find their inner serenity. If we can create around the world millions of people who are centered in their meditation, who know who they are, who know the tremendous bliss that comes when you enter into your innermost core, that will create a energy blanket around the earth. That is the only possibility to prevent.\nSo directly I am not concerned with war. My concern is how to create more peaceful people, more loving people, more meditative people. Because if the balance for peace-loving people is more in the world, then any war can be prevented.\nIf there are millions of meditators in the world, nobody can force them to go war, to go destroy innocent people. In fact, these people who have attained some light within themselves will become a tremendous barrier -- not only against nuclear war -- but against any kind of war.\nI am aware that nuclear war is impossible, and it is possible that the Soviet Union and America will come to a conclusion to drown all their nuclear weapons into the Pacific -- I don't know who gave it the name Pacific. Perhaps for this purpose\n-- and stop all traffic in the Pacific. Although it is five miles deep, there is always danger anything can trigger, and then it can become a chain explosion.\nSo for at least a decade, no traffic in the Pacific. Drown all the weapons there. And my feeling is, soon Russia and America will come to that conclusion. But that does not mean war will not happen. Then old type of war -- first world war, second world war -- those type of wars will continue. Thinking of the third world war, they look like children's play. But they were immensely horrible.\nSo as far as I am concerned, third world war is out of the question. But still other wars will be there.\nIf we want to prevent all kinds of war in the world, then we have to spread the red people to the farthest corner everywhere, so that we have a commune of millions of young people who declare that they are the owners of the earth, and they refuse any kind of passport, any visa.\nMovement is our birthright, and the whole earth is ours. If we have millions of people to destroy the boundaries of nations, the boundaries of religions, then there is nothing to fight for. Fight with whom?\nSo my direct effort is not to prevent war or to be a pacifist and print pamphlets against war and protest and put posters on the walls and scream and shout. All that nonsense is not going to prevent. They were doing the same thing before the\nfirst world war. They were doing the same thing before the second world war. They are doing the same thing before the third world war. They are just useless people. Good intentioned, but unintelligent.\nMy effort is to create a vast atmosphere of peace around the earth and that will be enough. War will become impossible.\nIn every country we will have thousands of sannyasins who will prevent that country itself, because they will say, \"First kill us and then you can kill the neighboring country.\" They will be sitting on the boundary line meditating, \"Kill us first.\" On both the sides. On the other sides also. Back to back.\nAnd I don't think any politician has the courage to kill millions of his own people, because then the whole country will destroy the government and the politicians and everything. Because these children are not doing anything wrong, and they belong to the whole country.\nSo create peaceful people, and if time arrives, we will risk all our peace-loving people. And I don't think that any country can go to war.\nIt has never happened that the people of the same country are opposing its own government, that \"War is not going to be our game anymore.\" And it is happening in both the countries. The enemy camp -- young people are ready there too: \"Kill us first and then you can do whatsoever you want.\"\nThere are a thousand-and-one possibilities to change this world. But the basic need is to spread more and more sannyasins all over the world.\nAlready the red color is no more associated with communists. We have taken its possession already, copyright is ours now.\nEven in Russia we have a beautiful group of sannyasins. Just the other day there was an article against me in a Russian magazine. They have been persecuting sannyasins. They have been taking their books away. The sannyasins have done nothing wrong -- no illegal thing, no crime -- so they cannot do anything to them. In the article they have published the main prominent sannyasins' names, so that they can be recognized by the people anywhere, because they don't wear red clothes, they don't wear a mala. They are my underground sannyasins. They meet also in the basements of houses, so that they can meditate and nobody hears. They can listen to the tape, they can read a book.\nAnd they are more excited than anywhere else, because for sixty years Russian youth has been missing something which is the very flavor of youth, something revolutionary, something rebellious. For sixty years, Soviet youth is the poorest youth in the world.\nFrom their childhood they simply become adult. The youth -- that season -- never comes. Those days of dreaming of changing the whole world, of changing man, of creating a new humanity -- if they are not there, youth loses all its glamour, its splendor.\nSo they are immensely excited. And I know that communist countries will soon be having thousands of sannyasins -- without any question.\nAnd nobody else can provide communist countries anything that I am offering to them.\nThey have been taught there is no God. I say, \"Perfectly good, there is no God.\" They have been told there is no hell, no heaven. Perfectly true.\nThey have been told not to believe -- that's my whole teaching.\nOnly on one point... I am giving them something new -- that is meditation. And Marx or Lenin or Stalin, nobody has said that meditation is against communism. Just sitting silently, doing nothing... How can it be against communism? Or against anybody?\nSo my sannyasins need not be afraid in communist countries either, because my teaching agrees with Marx on every point, except meditation. But that is the whole secret: that meditation will destroy all those communist ideas, those Marxian concepts. And about meditation, there is not a single word against it in the whole communist literature, because they have never even heard about it. Marx knew nothing about it.\nSo try to spread meditation far and wide, and find out whatever is possible in your situation. The country is poor, then manage something. But communes have to exist. And once a commune is there, soon you will be able to produce many things, create many things.\nAnd the commune is not going to remain poor long. And it will become a prototype for other people, \"If we can create and we can live comfortably and we are not starving, and we are rejoicing, why can't you just do the same as we are doing.\"\nOkay.\nThe Last Testament, Vol 1 Chapter #30 Chapter title: None 20 August 1985 pm in Jesus Grove [NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's words]\nINTERVIEW WITH FRED BRUNING OF NEWSDAY, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK\nQ: BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU STAY WARM IN SUCH A COLD ROOM?\nA: is not cold.\nQ: TO ME IT IS VERY COLD.\nA: To me it is only cool.\nQ: HAVE YOU ALWAYS FELT BETTER IN COLD SURROUNDINGS, EVEN AS A CHILD?\nA: Always\nQ: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THAT IS ASKED IN MEDITATION: WHO ARE YOU?\nA: It is a little bit complicated. It is not an ordinary question. When you ask \"Who am I?\" you are not waiting for an answer. There is nobody to answer you. But by constantly inquiring \"Who am I?\" slowly, slowly other thoughts start disappearing. You become more and more attuned with only one thing -- this quest: \"Who am I?\" When all thoughts have disappeared and only the sound \"Who am I?\" remains, that is the miracle moment. That sound also disappears. First it kills all your thoughts, and finally it commits suicide -- not that you get an answer, but the question disappears. And that is the moment of ultimate bliss.\nQ: HOW OULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF?\nA: Impossible.\nThis question is possible [to ask] only of an object. And I am not an object; I am subjectivity. I can describe the table, I can describe the grapes, I can describe the\nwhole world -- except me. Description is applicable only to objects. I am always the witness. If I describe myself -- in the very nature of things -- that description becomes false, because I am again witnessing it. I am always the witness, which cannot be reduced to an object.\nQ: IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DESCRIBE OTHERS, OTHER INDIVIDUALS?\nA: No. As objects of course, but not as a subjectivity. I can describe the color of your hair, I can describe the clothes you are wearing, but I cannot describe you, the being that you are -- that remains indescribable. And that's the whole mystery of existence: that at the ultimate core, at the very center, is something that you can experience, but you cannot explain.\nQ: DO YOU EVER HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR WORK, ABOUT YOUR ROLE?\nA: There is no question. For thirty-two years I have not encountered any doubt in me, any question in me. Yes, before I became enlightened I had millions of questions, millions of doubts. The moment I came to know myself, that dark night was over. Now there is no question of doubt, no question of repenting, no question of planning for the future. Just this moment is enough -- I am totally contented with it as it is.\nQ: THINGS COULDN'T BE BETTER?\nA: No, not for me. For you, yes.\nQ: I DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.\nA: That's why I am saying it. You are not sure; I am sure. Q: MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND?\nA: I can -- that's my whole business. Q: AND YOU ARE GOOD AT IT?\nA: I am just perfect -- not good.\nQ: YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE FOR ME BEFORE YOU CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THINGS COULD BE BETTER OR WORSE.\nA: No need for me [to know]. All sleeping people are sleeping people. It does not matter to me whether this man has a Ph.D. degree and asleep, this man is a doctor and he is asleep; that man is an engineer and he is asleep -- that does not matter to me. My problem is simple: they are all asleep and they will be better off if they are awakened.\nQ: I AM ASLEEP AS WELL.\nA: You are asleep as well.\nPeople [have been] doing everything in sleep for millions of years.\nQ: IS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM ALSEEP, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED?\nA: As far as I am concerned, yes. Q: IS SHEELA ASLEEP?\nA: Yes -- sound asleep.\nQ: HOW WILL YOU AWAKEN HER?\nA: I am trying...\nQ: DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE? DO YOU EVER FEEL 'ENOUGH'?\nA: I have never read any of my books.… I have never heard any of my tapes. I don't even bother what I said yesterday. And if you ask me tomorrow about this meeting, I will not be consistent with it at all. Because I don't carry comparison, memory; I simply go on existing moment to moment. You get bored because you compare: the same wife every night, the same kiss, the same geography... It is strange, unless you are asleep, to remain with one woman for thirty or forty years -- it is just a miracle!\nQ: THAT IS JUST WHAT MY WIFE KEEPS SAYING!\nA: That's good. Somehow help her to come here... All wives who run come here finally. Because you can run from one husband to another husband, but finally you have to run from husbands to my place. Here there is no husband and no\nwife.\nQ: IS MARITAL FIDELITY WORTH ANYTHING?\nA: Nothing -- just nothing.\nQ: YOU DON'T THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOME, NOT GOOD FOR OTHERS?\nA: No. The very word `fidelity' is ugly, dirty. If I love you, I love you. If I don't\nlove you, I don't love you. I am a simple, sincere, straightforward man.\nWhat do you mean by fidelity? Fidelity means: when you don't love, even then remain faithful. Anything that goes against love is ugly. What is the need of fidelity? If I love you, is that not enough? You need some fidelity too? That means there is a doubt in your mind -- you are afraid: today love is there; tomorrow it may not be. So something legal, religious -- the church, the court, and some condition of fidelity -- so when love goes away and the spring is over, you can cling to these props: fidelity, court, law religion, church. Love needs nothing.\nQ: HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED MARRIAGE?\nA: Never considered marriage. Q: DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?\nA: No. How can I have children? Not even my sannyasins have children.\nQ: WHY DO YOU SAY: \"HOW COULD I HAVE CHILDREN?\" OF COURSE YOU COULD HAVE CHILDREN.\nA: I don't want my child to be in this world with Ronald Reagan, Soviet Union, Ethiopia, India. In this starving world, where people are piling up nuclear weapon to destroy the whole planet... I would not like my child in this world -- no!\nQ: WHO DO YOU CONSIDER HISTORY'S MOST ADMIRABLE FIGURES AND MOST DESPICABLE?\nA: Your whole history is bunk.… I mean the whole human history is bunk, because it is written by people who were victorious; it is all false. For example, in India, Britain ruled for three hundred years and they were the writers of history. And whatsoever they wrote was wrong. They were not writing about the reality, the fact. To them the Indian revolution was only a mutiny; it was not revolution. Revolution has respectability about it; mutiny is something ugly to be crushed.\nThe moment India became independent, they rewrote the history -- they changed those three hundred years. Now, who is right?\nWhen Stalin came into power in Russia, he changed the whole history of the revolution -- he even changed pictures. Trotsky was the second figure to Lenin, so in every picture he was sitting next to Lenin. Stalin was nobody. He changed the pictures: Trotsky was removed; Stain's picture was put instead. And all the old books were destroyed. Trotsky himself had escaped and he was in Mexico, writing history. He was on the last page, when one of the murderers from Stalin hit him on the head with a hammer.\nLooking at Trotsky's history -- and he was one of the chief characters in the history... Lenin was not a very impressive person; he had no charisma. He was a great organizer...\nTrotsky had charisma, and he had influence over the masses. Both together were immensely helpful and complementary to each other.\nQ: YOU HAVE READ WIDELY?\nA: I have read immensely.\nQ: DESPITE THE FLAWS IN HISTORY, WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE ADMIRABLE INDIVIDUALS?\nA: You will not even have heard those names that I consider admirable. For example, I consider admirable a poet in Japan, Basho, who has written a few small haikus -- three-line poetries. But each haiku is a tremendous experience of meditation. No poet in the whole world has been able to put so much in those few words. But only a meditator can understand it.\nQ: YOU HAVE EXPRESSED YOURSELF IN THE PAST ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, THOUGH?\nA: I have spoken on many individuals. Q: JESUS FOR INSTANCE?\nA: Yes, I have spoken on Jesus, Moses, Mohammed. I have spoken on hundreds of people... There are three hundred fifty books that I have spoken; I have never written anything -- those are all spoken words.\nI have admired one Chinese: Chuang Tzu. He is the most absurd character in the whole history of man; that is why I admire him.\nQ: WHY DO YOU ADMIRE ABSURDITY?\nA: Because life is absurd. To search for meaning in it is going to be frustrating. That's why western philosophy has come to a certain philosophy of existentialism, which talks only of meaninglessness.\nChuan Tzu says that there is no need to search for meaning. If you search for meaning, then you will end up in meaninglessness, and that will be frustrating. Life is an absurdity -- it is a mystery. You need not search for meaning, you have just to live it, enjoy it. And I agree with him.\nQ: YOU SEEM TO DELIGHT IN CONTRADICTIONS. I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\nA: Yes, that's what I am saying; I am always contradicting myself knowingly, so that nobody can make a consistent philosophy out of me.\nQ: BUT IN THE END, WHAT WILL BE LEFT BUT A SERIES OF CONTRADICTIONS?\nA: Those contradictions, if you pass through all of them, first will create confusion in you; second, will create a tremendous silence in you. If you persist, if you don't escape from the confusion, they will create a silence in you -- and that silence will be a revelation. So I am not giving a philosophy to people; I am giving a device for them to discover the ultimate silence of existence -- which is meaningless, as meaningless as a roseflower is.\nQ: HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED?\nA: I don't want to be remembered. Q: BUT YOU WILL BE!\nA: That is other people's problem.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU WANT SET ON YOUR TOMBSTONE?\nA: No. Nothing. Once I am gone, I am gone. Then whatsoever my people want to do, they can do.\nQ: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE; WHAT DO YOU DO?\nA: First thing to understand about is that whatever I am doing, I am not a doer -- I am always a witness. Taking a bath in my bathroom, there are two persons: one is taking a bath, another is watching. And the watcher is me. The one who is\ntaking a bath soon will be in a grave. So as far as my inner being is concerned, it is just the same, twenty-four hours. Sleeping, I am watching; talking to you, I am watching; sitting silently in my room for hours, I am watching. So as far as my essential being is concerned, I am only a witness. But the doer is there -- I have to get up in the morning. But I never get up on my own -- I am a lazy person.\nQ: WHO WAKES YOU?\nA: Somebody takes care of me... she is here: Vivek. She wakes me up at six o'clock in the morning. And then one and a half hours I enjoy my bathroom.\nQ: ONE AND A HALF HOURS?\nA: One and a half hours -- that is minimum. Q: WHAT GOES ON?\nGreat things...\nQ: I SAW THE INTERVIEW ABOUT THE VERY ELEGANT BATHROOM AND YOUR INVITATION.\nA: Yes, I have not only one bathroom -- I have two, because if something goes wrong with one bathroom, the other is all ready, emergency ready. I cannot miss anything.\nQ: WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?\nA: Just some plumbing problem arising...\nBecause I cannot miss anything -- I want to take as much out of each moment as it is possible. I love taking a bath(tub), playing with soap bubbles. Albert Einstein discovered everything about the universe, playing with soap bubbles. My one and a half hours is nothing -- he was sometimes six hours in his bathtub.\nQ: MAYBE HE HAD TROUBLE GETTING OUT.\nA: His wife had trouble getting him out. But because I won't have any wife, there is no trouble.\nQ: SO YOU ARE READY FOR THE DAY AFTER?\nA: Yes. One and a half hours taking my bath, I am taking my shower. And I have all the best hypo-allergenic soaps, shampoos, conditioners -- I enjoy them immensely.\nQ: AND THEN AFTER... DO YOU DO ANY ROBUST WORK, ANY KIND OF EXERCISES?\nA: Just a little exercise in my bathroom. Q: ALSO IN THE BATHROOM...\nA: My bathroom is big enough.\nQ: AND THEN IS THERE A PERIOD OF STUDY?\nA: No. For five years I have stopped studying anything; not even a newspaper -- nothing.\nQ: DO YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD? A: No.\nQ: IF I ASKED YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN NICARAGUA OR EL SALVADOR, WOULD YOU KNOW?\nA: No -- unless Sheela informs me; that is her duty. She is my secretary; if she feels that something is happening which needs to be informed, then she brings it to me.\nQ: IS THERE ANYTHING IN CURRENT HISTORY?\nA: Yes, right now she is bringing every information about AIDS, which is significant.\nQ: IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN SEPTEMBER YOU WILL INVITE SOME VICTIMS OF AIDS TO THE COMMUNE FOR CARE. IS THAT TRUE?\nA: Perhaps, perhaps. Spread the gossip.\nQ: HOW DO YOU THINK THE SANNYASINS WOULD RESPOND?\nA: Just the way they are responding -- they will laugh. They will laugh, because\nmy sannyasins don't consider death a calamity; it is a celebration, a new beginning.\nQ: DO YOU THINK AIDS REPRESENTS SOME COSMIC PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT'S GONE WRONG SOMEHOW?\nA: No. There is no punishment in existence and no reward -- each action has its consequence. It depends on you, what you want to call it.\nQ: SO AIDS HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE BEYOND ITSELF? IT EXISTS, IT KILLS AND IT MEANS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT?\nA: That's all -- nothing more than that; nothing more in it. Religions bring the idea of punishment and reward, and through that they bring heaven and hell and the whole theology: that you are a sinner, that you are a saint. To me, there are only people -- neither sinners nor saints. And everybody has to do what he wants to do. If a person ends up with AIDS it is totally his responsibility; he was doing things which have brought him to a certain end. And he should be perfectly happy with it -- nobody has forced him.\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS: HOMOSEXUALITY AND DRUG ABUSE?\nA: I don't. Each individual's thinking. as far as I am concerned, anything that is\nunnatural, anything that is not part of the program or your biology, physiology, is going to lead you into trouble. But you may like the trouble -- you may love the challenge.\nI am against homosexuality, lesbianism and all kinds of perversions. But that is my personal opinion. If any individual chooses to be homosexual, there is no condemnation in me for the person. I am not going to throw him into hell; I am not going to judge him. That is his [way]. I have told my opinion; [if] still he feels that homosexuality is the only thing that is appealing to him, then he has every right to be a homosexual.\nQ: BUT YOU SEE THAT AS AN UNNATURAL ACT?\nA: Not only see -- I say also say that it is an unnatural act. But you are free to do something unnatural.\nQ: WHAT FOR YOU IS SEXUAL PERVERSION?\nA: It is a religious disease, sexual perversion.… It is a religious disease. All the religions of the world are responsible for it because first they started forcing celibacy on people, which is unnatural. Unless you are impotent, you cannot be celibate. And the strangest thing is: not a single impotent person has become enlightened in the whole history of man.\nThat means that all these people -- Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Krishna -- all these people were more sexual than ordinary people. It is their oversexual energy that does not feel contented with women and children and the ordinary, mundane world. After all this experience they are still too full of energy and they want to go on some higher quest. All these people are oversexual.\nNo impotent person has contributed anything to the world, because he cannot be creative. His basic creative energy, sex energy, is missing. Telling people to be celibate and then putting monks in one place, in one monastery and putting nuns into another place, and not allowing men and women to meet, you are creating the situation for homosexuality. So Catholics are responsible, Hindus are responsible, Buddhists are responsible -- they are creating the situation.\nQ: I DON'T THINK CATHOLICS OR BUDDHISTS OR HINDUS ARE ANY MORE LIKELY TO BE HOMOSEXUALS THAN ANYONE ELSE.\nA: They have to be. Particularly their monks -- what will they do?\nQ: BUT THAT DOESN'T EFFECT NECESSARILY THE MASSES OF PEOPLE.\nA: That reflects, because those... for example, in India there are five million Hindu monks. Now these five million Hindu monks are staying in Hindu families, are coming in contact with Hindu children, women -- all kinds of people. And they are bound to spread their perversion in every possible way. They will be abusing children for their sexuality.\nThey have been caught: just now, three or four days before, one Christian priest has been imprisoned for one and a half years because he was abusing small children.\nQ: BUT THESE SEEM ISOLATED INCIDENTS...\nA: They are not isolated. They don't come to your notice -- that is one thing... because the church wants to repress them, the society wants to repress them, the government wants to repress them. How many homosexual senators do you have?\nQ: GOT ME...\nA: No information about your senators.\nQ: YOU SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE ALL...\nA: I know.\nQ: HOW DO YOU KNOW?\nA: One personally I know.\nQ: YOU PERSONALLY KNOW A HOMOSEXUAL UNITED STATES SENATOR?\nA: Yes, yes. Yes. Not only homosexual, perhaps he may have AIDS.\nQ: WHO IS THE PERSON?\nA: Name I cannot tell you -- that's your work to find out. Q: HOW DID YOU COME UPON THIS INFORMATION?\nA: I will not tell you anything, but one thing I can tell you: that every vested interest is trying in every way to repress such information. For example, the pope before this pope was a homosexual -- everyone in Italy knew. He was a bishop in Milan, and he was always hanging around with a homosexual, and everyone knew. Then he became the pope and that homosexual man who was hanging around him became his secretary, came to Vatican.\nQ: WHEN YOU SAY EVERYBODY KNOW, WHO IS EVERYBODY?\nA: Because you could have asked in Milan to anybody. These are things which people know, but which will not come to be given as evidence in the court. These are not easily provable things.\nQ: BUT PEOPLE SAY THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE.\nA: There is no problem. No, no -- you can ask me. I am not a pope and I am not a president and I don't care a bit about any respectability -- you can ask me. And I can put their information. correct. They may not be well informed. I can inform them about myself perfectly well.\nQ: THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO SPEAK OF.\nA: No -- not a single thing.\nQ: PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE...\nA: Whatever they say, you just tell me.\nQ: THEY SAY THAT YOU HAVE DEVELOPED THIS ORGANIZATION FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT, THAT YOU ARE A LLIAR, THAT YOU ARE A CHEAT, THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE UNFAIRLY, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN COARSE AND UNKIND IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH OREGON AND OF ANTELOPE FOR VERY PARTICULAR SELFISH REASONS.\nA: So start with one, so I can answer you. For example, I have not been coarse\nand unfair to Oregonians; I have been very lenient and very liberal. I should not have been so liberal. And from now onwards I will be coarse and I will show them what roughness means.\nQ: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN TOO LIBERAL, TOO LENIENT?\nA: We have just been factual -- calling a spade a spade. But now I am going to call a spade a fucking spade -- you can go and tell those Oregonians.\nQ: I THINK PEOPLE FEEL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SOME TIME.\nA: No, I have not been doing anything. Go point by point, so I can put you right.\nQ: THE POINT WAS THAT THINGS CAN BE SAID ABOUT PUBLIC PEOPLE WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY TRUTH TO WHAT IS BEING SAID.\nA: No. But you don't come across a man like me in your public people -- you can ask me and I can answer you directly. For example, you cannot ask your public people; they depend on you, their respectability depends on you. If a senator says he is a homosexual, perhaps next election he is gone. But as far as I am concerned, I am not dependent on anybody in the whole world -- not even your God. So I can simply be true. Only I can be true -- anybody who is dependent cannot be true.\nQ: I MIGHT ASK YOU HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK, AND YOU MAY TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING IN THE BANK. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT.\nA: Just listen to me: you can inquire. Has anybody ever seen me with a single dollar? I don't even have pockets. I don't have even a diary to keep my accounts.\nI don't have any connection with any bank in the whole world. You can put your\nF.B.I. or C.B.I. or whatsoever nonsense you have in America -- if they can find a single bank account of mine, I am ready to be shot. They should inquire. And I am ready -- if they can find a single paise in my name anywhere...\nQ: YOUR BEING WILLING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DOESN'T SETTLE THE ARGUMENT.\nA: Nothing settles the argument. Has any argument ever been settled? Is it settled that Jesus was the son of a virgin girl? For two thousand years theologians have been arguing, and he was simply a bastard.\nQ: YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS MORE EASILY DEALT WITH THOUGH...\nA: No, this is a simpler case to decide, because a virgin woman giving birth is a simple matter to decide. My case of bank account will take a long investigation.\nQ: BUT IT COULD BE DETERMINED.\nA: Yes, it can be determined. Q: THE OTHER CANNOT.\nA: The other can also be determined -- I determine it. And no medical person can refuse me.\nQ: THAT HAS TO DO WITH MATTERS OF FAITH. WHAT IS YOUR NOTION OF FAITH?\nA: Faith is simply for the ignorant and the idiots; faith is not for intelligent people. Intelligent people try to know things. Either they know, or they don't know. If they don't know, they simply accept that they don't know.\nQ: BUT PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE FAITH IN YOU.\nA: Nobody can say that.\nQ: I TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO SAY...\nA: Then they are wrong...\nQ: ... WHO SAY THEY TRUST YOU.\nA: ... because I am continuously saying to them that nobody should have belief in me, nobody should have faith in me. What more can I do?\nQ: IT SEEMS TO ME, THAT MAKES YOU MORE APPEALING TO PEOPEL.\nA: So what do you say: Should I start saying to everybody they should believe in me, everybody should have faith in me? -- will that convince you?\nQ: I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOU FOR THIS VERY KIND OF CONVERSATION.\nA: That is people's business, but as far as I am concerned, I can only do two things: either I can say, \"Have faith in me\" or I can say \"Don't have faith in me,\"or I can remain silent. But in all the cases I am guilty. Just look at the situation: if I am silent, you can say I am silent and that is misleading If I say \"Don't have faith in me\" you say, \"They have faith in You because they love Your idea of not having faith in You.\"\nQ: EXACTLY RIGHT, YES. YOU ENCOURAGE QUESTIONING, BUT IS THERE ANY FORMAT SET UP FOR YOU TO BE QUESTIONED BY THE PEOPLE?\nA: No format is settled. They have to ask their questions. And there is no need for any format, for the simple reason that I don't come to you or to my people with any answers ready -- your question creates the response in me. So if I know, I will tell you. If I don't know, I will tell you I don't know anything about it.\nQ: A SANNYASIN MY FEEL THAT PERHAPS THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED DIFFERENTLY. HOW WOULD THAT PERSON MAKE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT HE HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT?\nA: I have nothing to do with money, and I have nothing to do with how it is spent.\nQ: HAVE YOU NO INFLUENCE IN THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT?\nA: No, I have no influence, no information -- that is different corporations, different corporation heads; they have to settle their own things.\nQ: I THINK WHEN YOU SAY THAT, PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE IT.\nA: That is their business.… By not believing it, it does not mean that they are right. There is half of the world not believing in God. All the communists around\nthe world don't believe in God. All the Buddhists in the world don't believe in God. All followers of Jainism don't believe in God. But even that does not prove that God is not. -- neither it proves [does it prove] that God is, because half of the world has faith in God. It simply proves that God is just a bogus word. You can go on arguing about it for millenia and you will not come to any conclusion, because in the first place there was nothing to conclude about.\nQ: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A CAPITALIST?\nA: I am a super-capitalist -- without a single cent.\nQ: YOU ARE IN A VERY FORTUNATE POSITION.\nA: That's why I am known as the Blessed One. I don't have to bother about any taxation. I don't have to bother about any bank account. I don't have to bother to earn, and [know] how to spend -- and still everything is available to me.\nQ: HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY YOU HAVE COME INTO SUCH GOOD LUCK?\nA: No -- I have simply accepted everything that has come (on) my way. Good or bad, I have accepted it.\nQ: DID YOU FORESEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS YEARS AGO? A: No.\nQ: WHAT WERE YOUR HOPES THEN?\nA: I am a without-hope person.\nQ: NEVER HAD HOPES FOR YOURSELF? NEVER DREAMS AS A YOUNG MAN?\nA: No. Just before twenty-one, I had.\nQ: WHAT WERE YOUR DREAMS THEN?\nA: They were dreams about becoming enlightened, and they were fulfilled. They were dreams about knowing myself, and they were fulfilled. And after that,now I have nothing to dream.\nQ: YOUR DREAMS DID NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF MATERIAL ELEMENT IN THEM?\nA: No. From the very childhood I was not interested in anything else than myself.\nQ: THAT'S UNUSUAL.\nA: It is. It is, in such an insane world, to be so sane is...\nQ: HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? IS IT YOUR UPBRINGING, YOUR PARENTS?\nA: Very difficult to account for it, because my parents were just ordinary people, as everybody's parents are. They tried their best to bring me to their religion. But I was rebellious -- I made it clear to them that `please leave me alone; let me search for myself'.\nQ: WHEN DID YOU BEGIN SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT TO YOUR PARENTS AND WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU IN RETURN?\nA: Almost when I was four -- I started small. About small things -- it is not only about big spiritual things -- about small things. For example, if my father would say, \"You just get out of the room -- don't disturb me.\" Then there was no way. I would simply refuse and say, \"You can go out if you are disturbed. I am not going out of the room alive.\"\nQ: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DISOBEYED; WERE YOU PUNISHED?\nA: I was punished.\nQ: HOW?\nA: In every possible way corporal punishment was used. I was punished but I was never angry and I had no complaint. I said...\nQ: YOU WERE HIT? YOU WOULD BE HIT BY YOUR FATHER?\nA: Yes. My father hit me, and he... Q: WITH HIS HAND?\nA: With his hand. And his whole life he repented for that one hit. Only once... because I had long hairs when I was a small child; I had very long hairs. And my father was in continuous trouble because he was a small shop- keeper, and I was continuously passing through the shop; the house was behind the shop. And everybody will ask, \"Whose daughter is this?\" That was very much hurting him -\n- that he has to tell everybody that `he is my boy, not my daughter'. And one day he became very angry and he said, \"This is an unnecessary irritation... and the whole day you are coming in and out. Either you start going through the back door or you cut your hairs.\" And he hit me.\nI simply went to a barber shop just in front of my house. And I told him, \"Shave my hairs completely.\" He was an old opium addict -- otherwise nobody would have cut my hairs completely. So he was in his mood -- he simply shaved my whole head. In India you shave your head completely only when your father dies; otherwise nobody will shave your hairs.\nI came back, and before I came back home, others had already reached there, thinking that my father is dead. My father was sitting there, and they said, \"What is the matter? I saw your son shaved -- and you are alive!\"\nThen I reached there and he said, \"What have you done?\" I said, \"This is the answer to your hit. If you are against long hairs, you will be half against small hairs\" I said, \"Let's satisfy you one hundred percent. So I have shaved them completely. And in the future, remember: if you want to hit me, I will not complain about it, but I will respond in my own way.\"\nQ: SHOULD CHILDREN DEFY THEIR PARENTS?\nA: Certainly. If Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God there would have been nothing in the world.\nQ: WHEN SHOULD CHILDREN OBEY THEIR PARENTS?\nA: Nobody should obey anybody unless your intelligence says it is right. But that is you obeying your intelligence -- not your father, not your mother.\nQ: BUT IS A CHILD PREPARED TO DO THAT?\nA: Yes, certainly.\nQ: SO IF A CHILD CHOOSES TO WALK INTO WHAT AN ADULT...\nA: Perfectly good. Rather than creating this stupid and mediocre world, it is far better that few thousand children every year jump into the ocean and die -- but leave the world with intelligent, rebellious, vibrant people.\nQ: BUT THAT WOULD TERRIFY PARENTS.\nA: Let them be terrified! I have terrified my parents -- why should I bother about other parents?\nQ: BUT YOU'VE NOT BEEN A PARENT. ISN'T THAT TOO EASY FOR YOU TO SAY?\nA: No, because I know my parents and it was not easy for them. In fact I had not been a parent because of them, because they wanted me to be married. I said, \"Then there is no way. If you keep quiet, some day perhaps I may get married. But if you continue in some way persuading me, then there is no way.\"\nQ: IF YOU SAW A CHILD PUTTING HIMSELF OR HERSELF IN DANGER, YOU WOULD NOT REACH OUT TO THAT CHILD?\nA: I will tell the child that \"there is danger, and you are going into danger; you can die. I can make help available to you if you want, but if you have decided to go into it, then go -- with all my blessings.\"\nQ: YOU WOULD NOT PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN A CHILD WHO INSISTED ON WALKING ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS?\nA: No, I will not. I will not interfere in anybody's freedom, whatsoever the freedom is for.\nQ: BUT THAT'S ONLY THE FREEDOM TO DESTROY YOURSELF. A: No.\nQ: IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD.\nA: This is only one case. The question is: out of a hundred cases there may be one case where your example may be applicable In about ninety-nine cases there is no death involved. Just for one percent I am not going to destroy the freedom of ninety-nine percent of the people.\nQ: BUT IS THAT ANY MEANINGFUL LIMIT ON A CHILD'S FREEDOM -- TO PROTECT THE CHILD FROM DANGER?\nA: I will tell everything to him, and if he allows me I will help him physically to get out. But if he says that he wants to go into it, that he understands what I am saying, then with all my good wishes he can go.\nQ: AND IF PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU ARE TOO DETACHED FROM THE WORLD, YOU ARE MAKING NO SENSE EXCEPT YOURSELF; WHAT YOU SAY REALLY DOESN'T APPLY TO THE BROAD POPULATION?\nA: I don't care -- why should it apply? Everybody has intelligence, everybody has to decide for himself. This whole idea that you should interfere in other people's life is being brought by the political leaders, by the religious leaders. They have conditioned the whole humanity that you have to serve others, you have to sacrifice yourself, that you have not to be selfish. My whole approach is that you have to be selfish, and only if you enjoy serving somebody -- serve -- because there is no other reward.\nQ: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT SERVICE TO THE POOR: YOU'VE SAID A FEW THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT?\nA: I am not a consistent man -- you should remember that.\nQ: SHOULD YOU BE HELPING THE POOR? ARE WE NOT OBLIGED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO HELP THOSE IN LESSER SITUAITONS?\nA: No. All these are just nonsense words: `human beings' -- where are human beings? Just in theory... Monkeys never became man -- perhaps human monkeys may have become -- but I cannot say Ronald Reagan is a man; a chimpanzee perhaps.\nHuman beings would not have been in such a stupid state in the first place. Why is there so much poverty? -- those poor people are responsible for it.\nQ: THE POOR PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN DILEMMA?\nA: Certainly, yes.\nQ: WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO SOMEONE WHO LIVED IN THE GHETTOS OF NEW YORK OR CHICAGO?\nA: I have lived in India which is far worse.\nQ: AND WERE YOU SAYING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS?\nA: Yes. I have been saying there and they were trying to kill me. They are responsible because they have accepted religious ideas which make them poor. They have accepted a certain ideology that your poverty is your past life's\npunishment: in your past life you have committed bad actions -- that's why you're poor.\nQ: I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT THE POOR OF THE UNITED STATES BELIEVE, BHAGWAN.\nA: No, I don't know about... This they cannot believe, but they also believe that you are born is sin; you are born because Adam and Eve disobeyed God. And the whole humanity has to suffer for it until you repent, until you become Christians, until you become a follower of Jesus, who will persuade God -- because he is the only begotten son of God -- to save you. So the question has been removed from its real context: that there is exploitation. The rich are rich because they know how to exploit. The poor are poor because they are not intelligent enough and not allowed to be intelligent enough so that they are not exploited -- one thing. Second -- the poor go on increasing the population of their own; the rich people don't increase their population.\nQ: SO SHOULD THE POOR BE PUNISHED FOR THAT?\nA: They are already punished. Who is saying that they should be punished? Q: WHEN YOU SPEAK THIS WAY YOU SOUND SO UNSYMPATHETIC.\nA: I am, I am.\nQ: YOU ARE UNSYMPATHETIC TO THE POOR?\nA: I am, because those poor are a great calamity on the earth, and they go on producing because they don't have any other entertainment than sex. And they are not ready to listen to me. They are ready to listen to the pope, who goes on saying that birth control is against God, that the pill is the worst thing that has happened to humanity, that abortion is anti-life. They listen to these people, and these people are making them more and more poor.\nQ: COULD THE POOR SAVE THEMSELVES BY LISTENING TO YOU?\nA: Certainly -- immediately.\nQ: HOW WOULD THAT WORK, THOUGH?\nA: It would work immediately. For example, in India I had been telling people for thirty years to use birth control methods, to use the pill, to use abortion --\nwhatsoever prevents population growth. But it goes against their religious ideas, it goes against their tradition.\nQ: BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE TO BEGIN PRACTICING BIRTH CONTROL, THAT WOULD NOT PAY THEIR FOOD BILL FOR THE NEXT MONTH. HOW CAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES NOW BY LISTENING TO YOU?\nA: The government was providing for free every birth control method. And in thirty years they have doubled the population. When I started speaking to them they were one four hundred million Indians; now there are eight hundred million Indians.\nQ: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POOR TONIGHT; THE PERSON WHO IS HUNGRY TONIGHT, THE PERSON WHO HAS NO MONEY TO PAY HIS ELECTRIC BILL TONIGHT; WHAT CAN HE DO?\nA: He should go to the church and first ask the priest there to give him food. Ask your god, ask your savior -- he has been saying that he is coming back. Two thousand years have passed and and he has not come back yet, so `you give us'. And your savior was turning stones into bread, walking on water, raising the dead. So why can't the pope do the same? He's his representative, an infallible representative -- he should do all these things. If he cannot, then burn the whole Vatican.\nQ: YOU SPEAK WITH SO MUCH DISDAIN FOR JESUS, ALTHOUGH WE ARE IN PART OF THE COMMUNE CALLED JESUS GROVE, AND IN THE PAST YOU HAVE SPOKEN RATHER FONDLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, OF JESUS AS A... FIGURE. HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?\nA: No. I have spoken about only half of Jesus before; now the remaining half. Before, I spoke abut the day; now I am speaking about the night -- twenty-four hours I have to finish.\nQ: PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, THE YUPPIES' GURU?\nA: People don't say -- I say. This is actually the fact. That's why I say I am not\nlike other public figures. Nobody -- Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha -- had the guts to say that they are the rich man's guru, and they all were. Buddha had all of the kings of India come to his feet, offer him thousands of acres of land and gardens. He was the rich man's guru but he had not the guts to say it. I have the guts to simply say what is the fact: I am the rich man's guru, because only a rich man can be religious -- a poor man cannot be.\nFor example, if you ask Albert Einstein, \"Can you teach a poor man higher mathematics, physics?\" he will say, \"How can I? First he has to go through the complete courses of the university and at least have a master's degree in physics. Then, perhaps I may be able to start from scratch.\"\nReligion up to now has never asked for any qualifications from anybody. And religion is the highest experience in life. This is a strange situation: Only a rich man -- who has lived with all luxuries, all comforts, who has attained to his ambitions and is now feeling that nothing satisfies, that nothing brings the delight he was hoping for -- is ready to go into the direction of religion. A poor man asks for food, a poor man asks for medicine; he does not ask for meditation.\nQ: HE HAS MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS THOUGH, BHAGWAN.\nA: And I don't have food to offer him.\nQ: BUT IS IT A WORTHY WAY TO SPEND A LIFETIME, MINISTERING TO THE RICH?\nA: Only one man in the whole world ministering to the rich, and the religions -- three hundred religions are there -- and all their priests and all their public servants are serving the poor. And just look: one man is looking after the whole rich world so well, and everything is going perfectly well. And all those idiots -- three hundred religions -- and millions of monks and nuns, and what are they doing?\nQ: WELL, YOUR JOB IS EASIER THOUGH, ISN'T IT?\nA: So I am ready to change. If they have guts, I am ready to change -- I can become the pope, pope can come here.\nQ: WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE THE POPE?\nA: First I will destroy Catholicism completely.… Because if six hundred million people are deleted from the world, we have solved a great problem for poverty.\nQ: DO YOU HAVE ANY USE FOR PROSTESTANTISM?\nA: I will take them when their number comes. First: Catholics... because Protestantism is nothing much -- it is below my dignity even to condemn them.\nQ: YOU DON'T THINK OF MARTIN LUTHER AS A SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL?\nA: Martin Luther was simply a politician, and wanted to be a pope himself. Because he could not be a pope -- so the protest, and the Protestantism. And that is just a German mind and nothing else. And you cannot think...\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF A GERMAN MIND?\nA: Just zero! Mind and German...? German and mind are contradictory terms. Q: WHAT KIND OF MIND SCORES HIGHER?\nA: Polacks! They are the highest. So just see a single man taking care of the whole world's rich people, without moving out of his place, and all these people are taking care of the poor... And just compare the work of one man against three hundred religions and their millions of servants, and you can see.\nIn my commune, not a single baby has been born in four years, and I have not told anybody that you have not to give birth. Simply stating that the world is too much populated... you should think -- you are intelligent.\nQ: THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE CHILDREN?\nA: For twenty to thirty years there should be no children. Only then can we cut\nthe population to one-fourth of what it is now. And once one-fourth of the population is there, then every couple can be allowed to have two children.\nQ: HOW COULD THAT EVER WORK?\nA: If it is not going to work, then AIDS will work, then third world war will work.\nQ: DO YOU HAVE A VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT INCLUDES A THIRD WORLD WAR?\nA: If I am not the alternative, then there is no world. Q: YOU OR WORLD WAR III?\nA: It is me or the whole world. Really, things have come to such a point: either they have to listen me or go to hell.\nWhomsoever they have listened to up to now have led them wrong. The politicians have created the nations, the wars, and now the ultimate war -- the third world war -- they are preparing for every day, piling up more and more nuclear weapons. They already have more than are need -- seven hundred times\nmore. They can destroy the whole earth seven hundred times -- still they are piling up. I don't know what kind of arithmetic these people have learned.\nQ: WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE TO RONALD REAGAN IN REGARD TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS?\nA: Just drop all those nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean -- that is the meaning of the name `Pacific Ocean'. Drop all nuclear weapons. Be first and declare that \"we are not for war, whatsoever the consequence.\"\nQ: DO YOU FEAR THE SOVIET UNION?\nA: There is no problem, nothing to be worried [about]. If the whole world drops war, what can Soviet Union do? Let them conquer the whole world -- what is wrong? Rather than getting destroyed completely, it is perfectly good to have a Soviet government all over the world. What is wrong in it?\nQ: IN THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A TERM PEOPLE DESPISE: 'BETTER DEAD THAN RED'\nA: So then, be dead; but we have decided to be red. We are not deciding for being dead. So our slogan is: Better to be red than dead.\nIt is only a question... Just think: if I say [this] to Soviet leaders, they will ask the same question that `American is going to run over us'. If I say to Americans, they think `the Soviet Union is going to run over us'. So nobody is willing to do it first, but somebody has to do it first. And America, being a far more intelligent, far younger nation, far more democratic, far more intelligent -- I would like to appeal to America first: that you be the pioneer.\nQ: YOU'VE SAID SOME HARSH THINGS RECENTLY ABOUT AMERICA. YOU SAID THAT VIOLENCE IS THE RELIGION OF AMERICA...\nA: I say all kinds of things in different contexts.\nQ: YOU'VE SAID THAT \"I BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS THE RELIGION OF AMERICA, THAT AMERICA HAS MISTREATED MANY GROUPS: RED INDIANS, BLACK PEOPLE...\"\nA: That's true.\nQ: WHY, THEN, DO YOU REMAIN HERE IF YOU FIND SO MUCH EVIL IN THE UNITED STATES?\nA: I will fight it.\nQ: WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT, SAY, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION?\nA: We are creating the commune of joyous, happy, silent, dancing, singing, loving people. And this commune is going to create a sabotage your whole American Society. If just a small atom can explode and destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then don't think a small commune cannot sabotage the whole American continent.\nQ: HOW WILL THAT WORK?\nA: You will know only when it has worked. Had you any idea how atom bomb would worked before it worked? Even those who made it had no idea how it would work. Einstein suffered his whole life after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, repenting that,in the first place, he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt that atom bombs can be made. He was not aware that so much is possible through a single explosion. And now we have seven hundred times more power to destroy.\nThis small commune is a life-energy phenomenon. If dead matter can explode... This type of experiment has never been done; what we are doing here is totally new -- we are creating a certain kind of energy field.\nQ: THIS IS WHAT THE EVANGELICALS SAY. REALISTICALLY, DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN?\nA: Those people have no idea what is going on here. Don't compare with all those retarded people.\nQ: LIKE BILLY GRAHAM, FOR INSTANCE?\nA: Yes. Billy Graham is the final word as far as retarded people are concerned. You can even just look at his face, and this is a face of a chimpanzee, not of a man. Well shaved.… Dressed in American way, but he is a chimpanzee. Just undress him and you will find...\nQ: WHICH IDEAS OF HIS DO YOU FIND MOST OFFENSIVE?\nA: Everything, because I find Jesus a crackpot -- so what about these people. I don't criticize Billy Graham or that kind of people. I think of Jesus as a crackpot, and these are...\nQ: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF REVEREND MOON?\nA: He should be sentenced for his whole life, not for one and a half years... and with him, all the other bishops and priests who have signed a petition for him, that he should be released and should not be punished.\nQ: ARE YOU DISTRESSED THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT YOU AND REVEREND MOON IN THE SAME CATEGORY?\nA: They can put wherever -- everybody is free to do that. In fact, Moon's and my name mean exactly the same thing: the moon.\nQ: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?\nA: Absolute difference -- there is nothing similar. I don't have any god, I don't have any paradise, I don't have a savior, I don't have a gospel, I don't have a holy book, I don't teach a certain theology, doctrine, creed, discipline. On the contrary: I teach individuality, freedom, doubt, skepticism, agnosticism: these words are anathema to those people like Reverend Moon.\nQ: AND YET, IN YOUR COMMUNITY THERE IS A SENSE OF ORDER AND AUTHORITY HERE.\nA: There is a sense of order, and that sense or order is coming out of the intelligent people living here. Nobody is ordering.\nQ: BUT THOSE PEOPLE SAY THEY DRAW THEIR ENERGY FROM YOU.\nA: They can say whatsoever they want to say -- what do I have to do with that? Nobody is ordering, nobody is trying to enforce a certain system of them. I am simply explaining my experience, my attitude, my approach to life, and leaving it to them. If they want to live, they are free; if they don't want to live, they are free. If they want to be here, good; if they want to go away, that is even better.\nQ: I SPOKE TO A YOUNG WOMAN TODAY WHO ONCE SAID THAT, WHILE SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOT CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD EVER DO THIS, THAT IF YOU DID AS JIM JONES DID, SUGGEST A MASS SUICIDE, THAT SHE WOULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD DO THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHAT DO YOU FEEL? WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nA: Certainly, that woman is telling her heart. She is not telling anything about me\n-- she is telling about herself. And as far as she is concerned, you have to ask her. That is her love for me, but I have not asked anybody to die for me -- I have asked people to live for me.\nThis is the only place on the earth where Jonestown cannot happen, because I am in total love with life -- with everything that life is. There is no denial, no renunciation of anything. And I would like my people to live as long as possible. But if somebody feels that way, that is his freedom. What can I do, I...\nQ: WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT A FANATICAL KIND OF RESPONSE?\nA: No, not at all. Not at all. Q: WHY NOT?\nA: It is simply her love.\nQ: ISN'T THAT A DANGEROUS KIND OF LOVE?\nA: Love is always dangerous. So people who are not capable of living dangerously are not capable of loving, either.\nQ: WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE JONESTOWN INCIDENT, WHAT DID YOU THINK?\nA: I thought this is where Jesus had led people. This was Jesus's doing. If I get\nhim, I am going to slap him on both his cheeks together, so he cannot give me another cheek.…\nBecause that's the whole conclusion, logical conclusion, of Jesus. Jesus was telling to his people that he is going to his Father's house to prepare a place for them, and then he will come and take them. Now two thousand years have passed; he did not come back.\nNow it is simply logical that Jim Jones thinks, \"Why bother first going, preparing?\" -- it is better to take the whole lot with you. I think this seems to be more logical and mathematical, and if Jesus had done that, that would have been better -- there would have been no Christianity. That would have been a great blessing in the world: if he had taken those twelve fools that he used to call apostles, humanity would have been saved from so much misery and suffering.\nQ: YOUR FOLLOWERS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOOLS AS WELL.\nA: They are!\nQ: DO YOU TELL THEM THAT?\nA: Yes. They are here -- I tell them.\nQ: THEY JUST DON'T LISTEN THOUGH?\nA: They do not. They know me -- they don't care what I say.\nQ: YOU ONCE LIVED A VERY SIMPLE KIND OF LIFE; NOW YOU LIVE A VERY OPULENT KIND OF LIFE. WHAT HAPPENED?\nA: I am just a contradictory man. One day I can again live a simple life; there is no problem in it. But whatsoever I do, I do it totally.\nQ: IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL GIVE ALL THIS UP?\nA: Every possibility -- any moment, because in the first place, nothing belongs to me, so I have not to give up anything. This watch is given to me for your interview. In my room, I am not... even wearing a watch. The car comes to me when they have to take me here. Nothing belongs to me. Everything belongs to the commune or to the Trust. So in the first place, I am still a poor man -- pretending to be a rich man.\nQ: IF YOU GAVE ALL THIS UP, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\nA: I will just go to sleep.\nQ: PERMANENTLY, OR FOR THE EVENING?\nA: Permanently.\nQ: WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO ALL THIS AFTER YOU ARE DEAD?\nA: I don't care, because nobody bothers. When I was not here, I was not concerned abut the world; neither the world was concerned about me. When I am not here, you think only one thing: that I am dead. You forget the other part: that you are dead for me, too. The connection is finished: The world is no more there for me, just as I am no more there for you. I become absent to you; you become absent to me.\nQ: DO YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION?\nA: I know; I don't believe. I don't believe in anything.… I know my own past lives. That's why I know there is reincarnation.\nQ: WHAT WERE YOUR PAST LIVES?\nA: Now, that will be a belief for you, only fiction. And a man who can write three hundred fifty books can write three hundred fifty fictions, also. So that is not much use...\nQ: BUT HOW MANY LIVES HAVE YOU HAD IN THE PAST?\nA: As many as you want. One thing I can say: I can lead you to the point from where you can look at your past lives -- at least one life -- and that will be proof enough of reincarnation. Telling my stories will not be of any use.\nQ: COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLE OF HOW IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST?\nA: No. I never give anything which can become a belief in any way.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT FUNERAL PREPARATIONS? HAVE YOU MADE SOME ARRANGEMENTS?\nA: No.\nQ: WOULD YOU WANT TO BE CREMATED IN THE NEW CREMATORIUM?\nA: That my people will think of. Who bothers? -- I am gone. People are so much worried about controlling, things, even after their death. When I am not there, this body is just matter. So whatsoever they want to do... if they want to throw it into the river, most probably that will be the right thing.\nQ: DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE IN OREGON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?\nA: I don't know. If I get the green card, I may go out. If I don't get the green card, I am going to be here.\nQ: YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA WORRIED NOW, I UNDERSTAND?\nA: In the whole world I have my communes, but everywhere I will have the same problem, so first I will have to settle here. If the green card is settled here, then I will go to Australia to fight again -- whatever card they have.\nQ: THE LAST THING, BHAGWAN: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA?\nA: I certainly have a message. Because America is not an old country like India, which has existed for thousands of years and has a burden of a long past, prejudice, conditioning. America is just a child compared to a country like India or China -- three hundred years mean nothing.\nAmerica has a very superficial layer of conditioning. If it can drop that conditioning -- being Christian, being Jew, being American -- America can become the first country of the world opening the doors for a new humanity. It is a risk thing, dangerous, but only America is young enough to take the risk.\nDrop all religions, drop the boundaries of the country, throw away all nuclear weapons, declare to the whole world that \"we are no more for war -- if anybody wants to invade us, we will welcome them.\"\nQ: IF YOU WERE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND YOU CHOSE TO VOTE; WOULD YOU BE A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT?\nA: I will be simply what I am. I cannot conceive myself in any other role.…\nThey both are the same type of people -- this is just a political conspiracy. It depends on a certain psychology of people, and democracy is using it.\nPeople's memory is very short -- three years. So four years, five years, one party rules, and naturally it cannot fulfill all the promises that it has given to the people. It starts falling in people's eyes, and for five years the other party has been giving promises that \"we will do what they have not done.\" So after five years, the other party comes on top, and this game goes on playing. Those two parties are conspirators, shareholders in the same company. It is a rotation of a wheel.\nI don't see any difference in their ideology; I don't see any difference in their principles; I don't see any difference in their faces -- they are all the same people, playing a game. It is a football: one time on this side and one team on that side. It doesn't make any difference to me.\nI am against parties. I want democracy to be partyless. Unless it is partyless, it cannot be democracy -- it is only temporary dictatorship. Four years, five years or whatsoever time in different countries... You give to a party four years' dictatorship: it is temporary dictatorship; it is not democracy.\nDemocracy will be possible only when there are no political parties and each individual decides on his own. Nobody is going to campaign, nobody is going to convince him. He is not a party member; he has not to follow a party line -- he has to decide himself.\nQ: RONALD REAGAN THINKS HE PRESIDES OVER A DEMOCRACY. IS HE INCORRECT?\nA: Absolutely incorrect. He does not preside over Rajneeshpuram.\nQ: IS HE A DELUDED MAN?\nA: He is... senile.\nQ: HE'S TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT?\nA: He really should go back to cowboy work, cowboy films, to Hollywood -- don't waste the time of the world unnecessarily. Even as a cowboy actor, he was a third class actor.\nQ: YOU LIKE MOVIES, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?\nA: Once in a while, if my people suggest them to me. Perhaps one or two which\nI liked. One was \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" That is Dostoevsky's novel that I have always loved, and I consider it more valuable than the holy bible. Another was \"Anna Karenina\" by Leo Tolstoy. That is a masterpiece of genius. So once in a while, if somebody sees something beautiful that they would like my time to be wasted on, they bring it.\nQ: I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU LIKED \"PATTON\" AND \"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.\"\nA: \"Ten Commandments\" I liked, as a film! Q: YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK!\nA: No. `Commandment' -- the very word -- is not for me.\nQ: DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME LOOKING AT VIDEOS? A: No.\nQ: AND YOU'RE NOT READING ANYTHING ANY MORE?\nA: No, for five years I have not read anything, but before five years I have read as much as people will read in five lives.\nQ: THANK YOU.\n","wordCount":"233936","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rajesh jain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/the_last_testament_vol1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The Last Testament, Vol 1</h1><div class=post-meta>1099 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;233936 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rajesh jain&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/The_Last_Testament_vol1/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>The Last Testament, Vol 1</p><p>Interviews with the World Press</p><p>Talks given from 16/07/85 pm to 20/08/85 pm English Discourse

chapter 1.] Ken Kashiwahara</p><p>GOOD MORNING AMERICA ABC NETWORK</p><p>USA</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPEAKING
WITH US TONIGHT. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, YOU ADOPTED A VOW OF SILENCE.
RECENTLY, YOU HAVE DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT TO YOUR SUPPORTERS AND THEN TO
US HERE TODAY. WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: I live spontaneously. I never decide anything beforehand. I
keep tomorrow open. If I feel like speaking, I speak. If I feel like
being silent, then there is no other way than to be silent. And I never
ask myself why, because no why is answerable. All answers are arbitrary.
So I simply go on floating with the river, never asking where it is
going, why it is going, where it is going to end. And this is my basic
approach to life: a total letgo.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WAS THERE A REASON THAT YOU DECIDED TO ADOPT THE VOW OF SILENCE IN
THE FIRST PLACE, OR WAS THERE ALSO NO REASON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is never any reason. I don't live by reason. I simply allow
things to happen. I don't know why I became silent. I don't know why I
started to speak again, but I enjoyed being silent and I'm enjoying
being out of silence again. I don't know about tomorrow. I may be
silent, I may be speaking. I may not be here at all.</p><p>Q: WHEN YOU WENT BEFORE THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE FOR A VISA AS A
RELIGIOUS LEADER, THE COMMENT WAS MADE BY THE OFFICIALS OF THE SERVICE
THAT HOW COULD YOU BE A RELIGIOUS LEADER IF YOU DIDN'T SPEAK? DID THAT
HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON YOU AT ALL?</p><p>A: No. Nothing influences me. Nor do I want anybody to be influenced
by me, because the very fact of being influenced is a kind of mental
slavery. I keep</p><p>myself totally free from influences, and I never influence anybody,
never try to convert, convince anybody.</p><p>I am the first one who can claim to be religious. The whole past and
its religions have been pseudo, false. To me religion has a totally
different meaning. There is no God. There is no heaven and hell. All
those past religions have exploited man with fear of hell and greed for
heaven, and all those religions have kept man retarded, dependent on
God, a big daddy somewhere above who is taking care of you. This made
man irresponsible. This made man unintelligent.</p><p>My religion is basically centered around consciousness, silence, and
silence has its own way of communication. Just as words speak, but can
be misunderstood- they ARE misunderstood-silence also speaks. It also
can be misunderstood. To understand silence, the other side, the
receiving side, should also be silent. Then there is a meeting of the
hearts. Something starts falling into tune, harmony, a kind of
synchronicity. Nothing is said, nothing is heard, but everything is
understood. Lovers know it; just sitting side by side saying nothing,
something goes on moving between them.</p><p>Q: IF YOU WERE TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE LISTENING AND WATCHING WHO KNOWS
NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR YOUR RELIGION...</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR THEOLOGY, WHAT IS YOUR BELIEF WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR,
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have no system of belief I have no catechism like Christians,
and I don't have any dogmas, principles, theology. If somebody wants to
understand me he will have to learn meditation, learn being silent and
sit with me, live with me. There is no other way. All those belief
systems are nothing but a process of conditioning you.</p><p>A belief simply means you don't know -- still you believe. My effort
here is that you never believe unless you know. When you know, there is
no question of believing, you know it. I destroy all belief systems and
I do not give you any substitute. Hence, it is not easy to understand
me.</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE NO PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No philosophy of life. I have LIFE itself. There are people who
have philosophies of life, but they don't have any life.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR PHILOSOPHY, IF THERE IS ONE, HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN "THE THREE
L'S, " LOVE, LIFE, LAUGHTER. IS THAT A PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE?</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?</p><p>A: It is just a consequence of being silent and in tune with
existence. Love arises in you. Life becomes abundant; laughter, for no
reason, just because this whole existence is so hilarious. This is not
philosophy, this is the consequence of being silent.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT TO ENJOY LIFE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no tomorrow. If there is tomorrow, you cannot stop
worrying about it. Tomorrow never comes, it is a process of worrying.
Nor is there any yesterday. One is no more, one is not yet. All that is
in our hands is the present moment, now, here. And this is a miraculous
experience. If there is no yesterday, no tomorrow, and this very moment
you are silent, all worrying disappears. All imagining, dreaming,
projecting disappears.</p><p>And it is not that you have to enjoy this moment. That rejoicing
arises out of this moment. But you are never here, you are always
somewhere else. You are never in the now, you are always then.
Otherwise, everything is available, but you are absent. I want my people
to understand a very simple fact -- not a philosophy, something
existential, not philosophical -- be present to this moment and then see
what happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID A MOMENT AGO. YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN CONTROLLING PEOPLE, AND HAVE NO CONTROL. BUT DO YOU
NOT HAVE EITHER CONTROL OR TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OVER 350,000 OF YOUR
FOLLOWERS?</p><p>A: I don't have any control. I don't give these half million people
who love me any discipline. I don't give them any commandments. I
insistently emphasize that they are not my followers, but only fellow
travelers. It is up to them to go a few miles with me or not to go. If
they join with me, I'm happy; when they depart, I say goodbye.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF THEY LOOK TO YOU, THEY WORSHIP YOU, WOULD THEY THEN NOT DO
WHATEVER YOU TELL THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am trying on my part that there should be no worship. They
should not be influenced by me. But if they worship and if they go on
being influenced, they are not understanding me.</p><p>Q: WHO IS BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH? HOW DID YOU BECOME BHAGWAN?</p><p>A: The word Bhagwan means "the Blessed One." When people started
feeling my blessing throbbing in their hearts, when they started feeling
that something has happened to me of immense value which they would like
to share, they started calling me Bhagwan. I could not deny it because
it was a fact: I was the Blessed One.</p><p>Q: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE THE BLESSED ONE?</p><p>A: How do I know when I have a headache? I know Q: WHEN DID YOU KNOW
IT?</p><p>A: Thirty-two years ago.</p><p>Q: HOW DID YOU KNOW IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That question is absurd. When you are sick, you know. How do you
know? When you are healthy, you know. How do you know? That "how" is
absurd. You simply know it.</p><p>Q: WAS THERE A VISION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, there is no question of vision. Vision is always objective, of
something else. It was an experiencing. Not even an experience, but
experiencing. I was full of it. I was it. And since then not for a
single moment have I been otherwise. It was not something that happened
and disappeared. It was a transformation. It has remained with me.</p><p>Q: DID YOU KNOW AS A CHILD, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU WOULD BECOME THE
ENLIGHTENED ONE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I never knew... not even a single moment before. But I was
searching from my very childhood. I was seeking and trying in every
possible way not to be influenced by any religion, by any ideology,
because if I am already having a faith, already believing, the search
stops. The inquirer has to be very alert and aware that no belief enters
into his being. He has to remain open and agnostic, knowing perfectly
well that he does not know. From that space of not knowing, the search,
the seeking, arises. But who can say when it is going to be fulfilled?
It is unpredictable.</p><p>Q: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A GOD?</p><p>A: My God! There is no God, so how can I consider myself a god? God
is the greatest lie invented by man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because man feels so helpless, so afraid of death, so burdened
with life's problems. Because he has been raised by a father, by a
mother, and those were the beautiful days -- no responsibility, no worry
-- somebody was taking care of him. That psychological childhood is
projected into all the religions: God becomes the father. And there are
a few religions in which God becomes the mother. It is a simple
psychological projection of a child. It has no basis in reality. And
whenever you are afraid, whenever you are in trouble, you start seeking
help. No help ever comes. Even Jesus on the cross was waiting for the
help to come, and finally got disappointed and shouted, "Father, have
you forsaken me?" A great doubt must have arisen in him, a great
question. Nothing is happening, and he was believing all these years
that God would come to save him, his only begotten son. Nobody came.
Jesus Christ must have died in utter disillusionment.</p><p>I don't have any illusion. I cannot be disillusioned.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HE ALSO SAID, "FATHER, FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY
DO."</p><p>A: That was again the same mind. I call Jesus' mind sick. Q: WHY?</p><p>A: Because his whole life... whatsoever he was teaching and doing was
just nuts. Only a crackpot can claim to be the only son of God. And
then, preaching to people that he is the savior, and whosoever is with
him will be saved, and whosoever is not with him will fall into hell --
eternal hell... all these things. His behavior: he cursed a fig tree
because he and his disciples were hungry and there were no fruits on the
fig tree. In fact, it was not the season; it was not the fault of the
fig tree, but he cursed the fig tree.</p><p>I cannot conceive of this man as sane. And this prayer to God that,
"Forgive these people because they know not what they are doing," is
again out of that same arrogant, egoistic idea. I don't think that it is
out of compassion. It is the emphasis of the Christians for centuries
that out of compassion he prayed even for his enemies. But let me repeat
his sentence: "Forgive these people because they know not what they are
doing." In fact, it was not an act of compassion, he was still
condemning the people that they knew not and he knew.</p><p>Q: BUT HAVEN'T THERE BEEN SOME TEACHINGS HANDED DOWN FROM JESUS WHICH
FORM THE BASIS OF MUCH THAT IS GOOD IN CIVILIZATION TODAY?</p><p>A: Nothing. Not a single thing has come out of Jesus which has helped
humanity in any way. All those teachings have proved not blessings, but
curses. They are beautiful words and because they have been repeated so
often, you have -- and everybody has -- forgotten the implications of
them.</p><p>He says, "Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God." It
looks beautiful, but basically it is ugly. It is a consolation to the
poor. It is an exploitation of the poor. It is giving false hope to the
poor, and the ultimate result is that the world has remained poor.</p><p>Who would not like to inherit the kingdom of God? Jesus says that
even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but a rich man cannot
enter through the gates of heaven. Now this man is responsible for all
the poverty in the world. He is condemning richness. He is condemning
the creativity which can make the world rich.</p><p>I am all for richness in all dimensions, and I cannot say, Blessed
are the poor. That is just what Karl Marx said: Opium of the people. It
is possible to use beautiful words, but if you go into the implications,
what are the Christians doing today and what have they done for two
thousand years? They will open orphanages. They are against birth
control. They are against abortion.</p><p>Q: SOME OF THEM.</p><p>A: Those who are not will soon be expelled. They are being expelled.
And those who are... for example the pope himself is against abortion,
against birth control. He is against the greatest revolution in humanity
-- the pill. Population goes on growing, poverty goes on growing, and
who is responsible for this? I think these people are criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE POPE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The pope. He should be behind bars. Q: WHY?</p><p>A: Teaching such stupid things to humanity: go on producing children
-- they are gifts of God. He is responsible for Ethiopia. He is
responsible for poor India. Anywhere poverty happens, these people are
responsible. On the one hand, they go on increasing the population,
which is already too much, in the name of God. But the real thing is
that they can convert only the poor to Christianity. I have</p><p>never seen a single rich man being converted to Christianity in
India. Beggars, orphans, prostitutes-these people get converted.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANY PART OF CHRISTIANITY, HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, ANY OF THE
ESTABLISHED RELIGIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE GOOD?</p><p>A: Nothing is. I want to be finished with the whole past completely,
I want it to be erased completely. I want a discontinuity with the past.
Only then the new humanity is possible, a new world, a new man. So I
categorically say everything is wrong. And the proof is there: the whole
world is in a mess. These are the people who have given the world
principles how to live, ideologies, systems. This is the outcome of
Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. This is the
outcome.</p><p>Q: YOU SAY THE WHOLE WORLD IS A MESS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO CREATE IN MAN, IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I'm simply saying that there is a way to be sane. I'm saying that
you can get rid of all this insanity created by the past in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just by being a simple witness of your thought processes. That's
my method of meditation. It is not a prayer because there is no God to
pray to. It is simply sitting silently, witnessing the thoughts passing
before you. Just witnessing -- not interfering, not even judging,
because the moment you judge you have lost the pure witness. The moment
you say this is good, this is bad, you have already jumped into the
thought process. It takes a little time to create a gap between the
witness and the mind. Once the gap is there, you are in for a great
surprise: you are not the mind, you are the witness, a watcher.</p><p>This process of watching is the very alchemy of real religion,
because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing,
thoughts start disappearing. A moment comes when there is no thought at
all. You are, but the mind is utterly empty. That is the moment of
enlightenment. That is the moment when for the first time you become
unconditioned, sane, a really free human being.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, SINCE YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO,
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS WRITTEN -- ALLEGED</p><p>-- ABOUT YOU AND THE RAJNEESHEES. SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE
SPEAKING IN PUBLIC, I'D LIKE TO GET YOU TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT
SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID. FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS BEEN
WRITTEN AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT</p><p>YOU AS A "FREE SEX GURU," BELIEVING IN PROMISCUOUS SEX WITH VIOLENT
ENCOUNTER SESSIONS AND MIND CONTROL. TRUE OR FALSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Do you think sex should be charged for? Should it not be free?
Should it be paid for?</p><p>To me, sex is a simple, beautiful, natural phenomenon. If two persons
want to share the energy with each other, it is nobody's business to
interfere. And to say "free sex" implies that you want sex also to be a
commodity, that it has to be purchased -- either from a prostitute for
one night or from a wife for the whole life, but it has to be purchased
and paid for.</p><p>Yes, I believe in free sex. I believe that sex is everybody's
birthright to share, to enjoy. It is fun. There is nothing serious about
it. The people who have been talking about me as teaching free sex are
really pathetic. They are sexually repressed people.</p><p>Q: I THINK WHAT THEY WERE IMPLYING IS THE IMAGE OF WILD SEXUAL ORGIES
GOING ON.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No orgies are going on. And if people should want an orgy, it is
nobody's business. If a few people want group sex, what is harmful in
it? If two persons can enjoy, why cannot ten persons enjoy together?
Once we think of sex as a natural, joyful fun.…</p><p>That's why I call the pill the greatest revolution since fire was
discovered. The pill has freed sex from all nonsense, seriousness,
marriage, legalities. It has made man enjoy sex for the first time as
man, not like other animals who are in a biological bondage.</p><p>No orgies are happening here, but I am not prohibiting them. It is up
to the people. If they feel like having an orgy, so far so good. But
these people are also conditioned by your society. They also have the
idea of relationship one to one. They also have the monopoly, monogamy,
planted in their minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THAT NOT GOOD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is absolutely unnatural. Man is not a monogamous animal at all.
He is polygamous and everybody knows it. You may have the most beautiful
wife, but that does not mean you don't get attracted to other women,
that once in a while you don't dream about other women. Somebody may
have the best possible husband. That does not make any difference. Man
is by nature polygamous. Monogamy iS enforced on him.</p><p>Q: ARE YOU SAYING THAT MAN SHOULD FOLLOW HIS POLYGAMOUS
INSTINCTS?</p><p>A: He should simply follow nature wherever it leads. Polygamy is
perfectly good. In fact, there is no need for monogamy or polygamy. I'm
a little further ahead. I see the relationship of love or sex as an
absolutely free phenomenon.</p><p>Q: YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING-AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE SUGGESTED BEFORE</p><p>-- THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY "WESTERN HANGUPS, " SO CALLED,
ABOUT SEX. RECENTLY YOU PREDICTED THAT AlDS WILL KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE
WORLD'S POPULATION, AND YOU TOLD YOUR FOLLOWERS TO ENGAGE IN CELIBACY OR
HAVE SEX WITH ONE PARTNER. WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: AIDS is a totally new phenomenon, and the old religions are again
responsible for it.</p><p>Q: RESPONSIBLE FOR AIDS? A: For AIDS.</p><p>Q: WHY?</p><p>A: They are responsible for everything that is wrong. Homosexuality
and all kinds of perversions were created by religious people, by
teaching celibacy. Now, to force men or women to remain celibate is
taking them against their biology, chemistry, physiology -- their whole
nature. It is impossible for them. They will find some way, and it will
be perverted.</p><p>Nuns were kept in one monastery, monks were kept in another
monastery. There are monasteries still where no woman has ever entered.
Now these monks are the original homosexuals. These nuns are the
pioneers of lesbianism. All kinds of perverted things have brought AIDS
as the ultimate result.</p><p>I'm not telling my people to be celibate because celibacy has any
spirituality. I'm telling them that you can be celibate without any
repression, just out of sheer understanding. You are not going to be
rewarded in heaven for it, you will just be being careful about your
health. That is enough reward. But if you feel that celibacy is
difficult for you, then use all possible methods to protect, to prevent.
AIDS is going to kill the larger part of humanity.</p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because it is spreading so fast. And it will spread... just one
contact with a person who has AIDS is enough, and then those contacts
will go on spreading. Just the other day I was looking into it because
we were having the festival. Fifteen thousand people were going to come
here from all over the world. Now it was a problem: many people can
bring AIDS and destroy the whole commune.</p><p>We tried to find out. Two sannyasins had it confirmed, and we asked
them how many other contacts they had. One woman had fifty contacts.
Those fifty people may be carrying AIDS and may be having other
contacts. That's why I have said remain with one partner. It is nothing
to do with monogamy, it is just pure hygiene, health. I am telling that
on medical grounds, there is no religious basis to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT. AGAIN, IN KEEPING WITH
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AND SAID ABOUT YOU AND THE
RAJNEESHEES, AND THAT IS THE FEAR WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOUR BODYGUARDS
CARRYING WEAPONS -- SUBMACHINE GUNS-AND RUMORS THAT THERE ARE LARGE
CACHES OF WEAPONS HERE ON THE RANCH. IS THAT TRUE? AND IF SO, WHY ARE
THE WEAPONS KEPT HERE?</p><p>A: I'm not a man like Jesus Christ. I will not carry my cross on my
own shoulders. And I'm not suicidal. Jesus must have been suicidal. I
love life, my people love life. I'm not afraid of death. I will enjoy
death as much as life, but my people don't want me to leave the body
now, and they have every right to protect me. I'm not going to prevent
anybody who is going to assassinate me. Why should I prevent my people
from protecting me?</p><p>If the assassin is free, I'm not going to interfere. And the people
who love me and want to protect me, I'm not interfering with them
either. This is something between those who love me and those who hate
me. This is their business, I am simply out of it. Yes, guns are there,
but not according to the rumors. Those rumors are too much
exaggerated.</p><p>Q: LARGE NUMBERS OF GUNS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, not large numbers.</p><p>Q: DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ATTACKED? ARE YOU AFRAID OF ATTACK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not afraid of anything. I have been attacked many times
before. I can be attacked any time and I'm not concerned about it, but
my people are concerned. Who am I to prevent them if they love me and
want to do something? And I have around me one of the most intelligent
groups of people.</p><p>Jesus had only twelve fools -- uneducated, unintelligent fishermen,
carpenters -- and he himself was uneducated, uncultured. And when he was
crucified they all escaped. They were not in love with Jesus; they were
hoping that through Jesus they would enter into paradise and enjoy
paradise.</p><p>I give no hope to my people, no promise to my people. They are not
going to gain anything as reward.</p><p>Q: SO WHY SHOULD THEY STAY HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They stay here because meditation is its own reward. There is no
other reward beyond it.</p><p>Q: IN FACT, RECENTLY YOU SEEM TO BE PAINTING A VERY PESSIMISTIC
FUTURE OF THE WORLD AND MANKIND WHEN YOU WARNED THAT A CYCLONE OF
DESTRUCTION BOTH NATURAL AND MAN MADE WILL HIT THE WORLD, AND THAT THE
RAJNEESH RELIGION WILL PROVIDE A "NOAH'S ARK OF CONSCIOUSNESS," ALLOWING
YOUR SUPPORTERS TO SURVIVE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not pessimistic. It is simply factual.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It simply means that all the centuries that have passed have been
bringing this day closer and closer. Religions have been talking about
peace and fighting and killing and murdering, burning people alive. On
the one hand they will say God is love, on the other hand they will be
burning living people. Christians have been killing, Mohammedans have
been killing, Hindus have been killing. It is a strange phenomenon that
Buddha was born in India, but in India there are no Buddhists. For
twenty-five centuries there have been no Buddhists. They had to escape
because Hindus were killing them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS CYCLE OF
DESTRUCTION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We have destroyed the harmony of nature through our unguarded
scientific experiments. We have now in the hands of politicians; who are
the most mediocre people in the world, such immense energy to destroy
that they can destroy this whole earth seven hundred times. Now if just
one politician goes nuts, that's enough -- and they are all nuts. So I
am not painting any pessimistic picture of the future. I am not a
pessimist, neither am I an optimist. I am simply a realist.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE NOT PESSIMISTIC; YET,
IF I MAY READ ANOTHER QUOTE WHEREIN YOU SAID "THIS WORLD IS NOT WORTH
SAVING. ONCE IN A WHILE I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER IF THE THIRD WORLD WAR
HAPPENS AND DESTROYS THIS WHOLE STUPID HUMANITY." ISN'T THAT
PESSIMISTIC? VERY GLOOMY?</p><p>A: This is optimistic!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because if something has become so rotten, it is better to be
finished with it. Q: YOU THINK THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED?</p><p>A: The world has become almost a madhouse. If we cannot change
people's consciousness, if we cannot destroy the boundaries between
nations, the boundaries between colors, and the boundaries between
religions -- if that is not going to happen.…</p><p>I am trying on my own whatsoever I can; but one cannot simply forget
the reality. The world is divided into nations, into religions, all
fighting and trying to kill each other. One cannot forget America and
Soviet Russia, ready to destroy the whole world any moment. This is
simple realism. As I see it, this humanity, if it is not going to
change, is not worth saving.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU, AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER, SHOULDN'T YOUR ROLE BE ONE TO
ENLIGHTEN AND TO HELP TO CHANGE...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That I am doing.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: RATHER THAN TO SAY THE WORLD SHOULD BE DESTROYED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is part of my effort. That makes my thing emphatically clear:
Either change, or the world is going to be destroyed. So your change is
absolutely necessary. It is not something that can wait, that tomorrow
we will change.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LET ME GO BACK... I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. WHEN YOU FIRST
GOT HERE TO OREGON, YOUR SUPPORTERS SAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE OVER THE
TOWN OF ANTELOPE. YET NOW RAJNEESHEES ARE IN CONTROL OF THE TOWN AND THE
RESIDENTS THERE HAVE CHARGED THAT THEY WERE FORCED OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS THE RAJNEESHEES REALLY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE
ENTIRE STATE OF OREGON. TRUE, OR FALSE?</p><p>A: I want first to make it clear that I am not a Rajneeshee. You
should ask Rajneeshees -- that is their problem. I am an outsider. I am
just a guest here, not even a resident. I am not even living in the City
of Rajneeshpuram, but outside the city in a guest house. I am not a
Rajneeshee; I don't belong to any organization. Now, whatsoever they are
doing, you should ask them.</p><p>Q: WELL, WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE THEM TAKE OVER THE STATE OF
OREGON?</p><p>A: I would like them to take the whole world! -- because I feel that
they can manage this world better than anybody else. But I am not
interested. I am not a politician, and that is not my concern.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT YOU AND YOUR RELIGIOUS FOLLOWING ARE
EXTREMELY WEALTHY. IF IT'S TRUE, WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM?</p><p>A: My people are rich. In fact, only the very rich, educated,
intelligent, cultured can understand what I am saying. Beggars cannot
come to me. Poor people cannot come to me. The gap is too big. They can
hear me but they cannot understand me. So it is natural: I am the rich
man's guru.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ISN'T THAT A CONTRADICTION WITH THE TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION OF A
LIFE OF AUSTERITY LED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND ASCETICS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I simply think those traditions just rubbish. There is no question
of contradiction; I am simply against them. I don't want to be
consistent with them. I want to drop all connections with the past. They
have done enough harm.</p><p>My conception of a beautiful, flowering being is not that of
austerity, it is of luxury. He will enjoy all that is beautiful in the
world -- great paintings, great music, poetry. I don't conceive of him
standing on his head in the hot sun of Oregon, fasting, slowly
destroying himself. To me, all religions of the world up to now have
been sado-masochistic. My religion is for the first time life-
affirming.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE REMEMBER ABOUT YOU WHEN
THEY READ STORIES OR SEE YOU ON TELEVISION IS THE FACT THAT YOU OWN SO
MANY, OR HAVE SO MANY ROLLS ROYCES. WHY IS THAT?</p><p>A: How many? Q: EIGHTY?</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: FORTY?</p><p>A: Ninety. And they are not so many. Q: WHY DO YOU NEED NINETY?</p><p>A: I don't need even a single one. And they don't belong to me,
either. But my people want 365, one for every day. And I go for a drive
only for one hour. But if my people want it, if they are happy and
rejoice doing it, I don't want to destroy their joy. It is perfectly
okay.</p><p>Q: COULDN'T YOU TELL THEM TO GIVE THEIR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE,
OTHER THAN FOR ROLLS ROYCES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: All other religions are doing that. Let them do that as their
work. Let me do my work. All other religions are looking after the poor.
At least leave me alone to look after the rich.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, THERE HAVE BEEN FEARS EXPRESSED, AS YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
YOU FIRST GOT TO OREGON, THAT RAJNEESHPURAM MIGHT TURN INTO ANOTHER
JONESTOWN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE THERE ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOU AND JIM JONES?</p><p>A: There is only one thing between me and Reverend Jim Jones, and
that is of absolute opposition. He was a Christian, and Christians are
cowards, afraid to take the responsibility for whatsoever happened in
Jonestown. From Jesus till this Pope the Polack, all are responsible for
it, because Christianity is a death- oriented religion. The cross is its
symbol.</p><p>There is nothing common between me and Reverend Jim Jones. Everything
is opposite to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PEOPLE THINK THE POWER YOU HAVE OVER YOUR FOLLOWERS.…</p><p>A: I don't have any power. I don't have any position. I don't even
know my people by their names.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU SEE THEM OUT THERE EVERY DAY AS YOU DRIVE BY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I see them, but I don't even know their names. I don't relate with
them personally, I don't talk with them personally.</p><p>What power? I don't have any power.</p><p>Q: YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE DEVOTED TO YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is their thing. I am not exploiting their devotion for any
power for myself. I could have declared myself the only begotten son of
God. Then it would have been a power trip. But I say I am simply an
ordinary man just like you. And I emphasize it again and again so that
my people can understand that if this experience can happen to me, it
can happen to them, too. It is nothing special. It is absolutely natural
and ordinary.</p><p>Q: SO YOU SEE NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN RAJNEESHPURAM AND JONESTOWN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not at all. But I see every similarity between Jonestown and the
whole world. Q: THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL END UP LIKE THAT?</p><p>A: They are trying. Seventy-five percent of their national incomes is
going into making more and more weapons, nuclear weapons. Even poor
countries are trying to create nuclear plants. They are all in tune with
Reverend Jim Jones. Except Rajneeshpuram, the whole world has a
similarity with him. This is the only place. We are absolutely opposed
to destruction. We believe in creativity.</p><p>We don't believe in the creator, we believe in creativeness.</p><p>And my people are creative. They have changed the shape of this
desert, with all the hindrances from the state, the government, the
politicians, the religious people. Still, they have changed it into a
small, beautiful oasis. If no barrier is created, we can make it one of
the most beautiful places in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: A NUMBER OF OREGONIANS HAVE EXPRESSED A CONCERN, HOWEVER, THAT YOU
WILL EVENTUALLY ATTRACT UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THIS
CITY AND THAT IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU CALL ALL 350,000
OF YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COME HERE TO LIVE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I may.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU MAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN?</p><p>A: Anytime. Tell the Oregonians that their fear is perfectly right.
Tremble. Have nightmares. I can call my followers anytime.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND YOU MAY DO IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: But I may not.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT THIS LAND SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT
THAT MANY PEOPLE, THAT IT WOULD HURT THE LAND IF THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVED
HERE. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The people who say these things, have they ever come here? Just
four years ago there was no water. We managed two big lakes, small ponds
all around, enough water. And we can create more lakes, more water. We
can make more land ready to be cultivated. It is only a question of
effort, devotion, and the joy of creation. Those people are simply
jealous, lazy, lousy, and nothing else. And it is our problem, not their
problem. If my people die because the water is not enough, the land
cannot support them, then it is my problem, not their problem. I will
not come to them for help.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU ENGENDER SUCH HOSTILITY ON THE PART OF YOUR
NEIGHBORS AND OTHER OREGONIANS?</p><p>A: There are no neighbors. We are alone here, and we want to be alone
here. Q: PEOPLE IN NEARBY TOWNS.…</p><p>A: We don't want even to relate.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS THIS HOSTILITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not hostility. It is simply that we want to be left
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, ON THE PART OF SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OREGON, SOME
OREGONIANS.</p><p>A: Now, that is their problem, and you have to ask them. We don't
have any hostility towards them. All that we want is to be left alone to
do our thing. They are hostile because this land was there, available,
for fifty years, and they could not make anything out of it. And within
four years we have made a beautiful place where five thousand people are
joyously living, luxuriously and comfortably living. They are simply
jealous and hostile because they know we</p><p>can manage one hundred thousand people here. And to them, number is
power. To us, there is no question of any trip for power.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ISN'T IT REALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE DIFFERENT THAT THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU? THAT PEOPLE DRESS ALIKE, WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED,
WEAR BEADS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There are so many reasons besides. There was a time when the
Christians were treated by the Jews the same way. Just to be a Christian
was enough to be a criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DO YOUR PEOPLE WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED? WHY DO THE PEOPLE
here WEAR VARIOUS SHADES OF RED AND BEADS?</p><p>A: I want them to be recognized by me, and by other people. I want
them to face the world... that they have dropped out of it. I want them
to be clearly individual. They don't belong to this rotten world around.
The day I see that there is no need, they will be using all colored
clothes. It is nothing spiritual, nothing religious; it is simply an
identification card put all over the body.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE WHO HAVE ACCUSED YOU AND THE PEOPLE LIVING
HERE OF OBSCURING THE LINE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. IS THIS A RELIGIOUS
CITY, OR IS IT A CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SHOULD QUALIFY FOR SCHOOL AID?
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: This is not a religious city. The city has its own functions,
religion has nothing to do with it. Religion is an individual
phenomenon. It has nothing to do with the streets, the houses, the
maintenance of the city. Religion is purely individual. The city is
taking care of the collectivity of the community. They are two separate
dimensions. They don't overlap, they don't meet anywhere.</p><p>Q: BUT EVERYBODY LIVING HERE BELIEVES AND FOLLOWS YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nobody follows me because I don't have any followers. If somebody
is walking behind me, that does not mean he is a follower. If somebody
feels that what I am saying is true and experiences it as true, what
does the city have to do with it? The truth of the individuals living in
this city is their private experience. The city is for other purposes,
mundane. It has nothing to do with religion.</p><p>What I am saying is true only about Rajneeshpuram, that there is no
mixing of state and religion. About the outside world that is not true.
Everywhere else state and religion are mixed. Otherwise, why should the
Bible be there in the court for</p><p>somebody to take an oath? What does it mean? Every Bible should be
thrown out of every court. It is mixing religion.…</p><p>And do you think the people who are presidents, premiers, governors,
are not prejudiced in favor of some religion? Are they capable of
discriminating, so that when they are in the office they are no longer
Christians? It has not been our experience here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LET ME GO BACK, IF I CAN, A NUMBER OF YEARS, BECAUSE THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT IT. WHY DID YOU LEAVE INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For health reasons. I never wanted to leave. India may be poor,
may have its troubles and problems, but it has a beauty of its own.</p><p>Q: THERE WERE STORIES AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE FORCED OUT. IS THAT
TRUE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is nonsense. I can go back there. Nobody can force me out of
anywhere. If Oregonians cannot force me out of Oregon, do you think
Indians can force me out of India?</p><p>Q: DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE OREGON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I never plan anything. But I can leave any day. Or I may not
leave ever.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IS HOPING YOU WILL LEAVE THE
COUNTRY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are waiting, perhaps. They can wait... and if I don't want to
leave, I will not leave. I will go on fighting to the end. I will not
leave. If I want to leave -- even if the whole of America begs me to
stay here -- I'm not going to stay a single moment. Nobody forced me out
of India. In India I was living with my commune, ten thousand sannyasins
were living with me. It was my health that was getting worse and
worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE YOU RECOVERED NOW? ARE YOU BETTER?</p><p>A: Not completely. I am feeling better, but it is just on the
boundary line; at any moment a small thing, and the trouble can
arise.</p><p>Q: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU AND FOR RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I never think of the future. We are happy now.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT FEELING WELL TONIGHT
BECAUSE I'VE STOPPED SMOKING.</p><p>A: I knew. You must be feeling nervous. One hour more, and you will
be in a nervous breakdown. Smoking is a difficult thing for people to
stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT, JUST BRIEFLY, OF YOUR DAILY ROUTINE,
WHAT YOU DO HERE?</p><p>A: I am a very lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's guide to
enlightenment. I don't do anything. In the morning I have started
talking again, as I have been doing for thirty years. I love it. It is
not a lecture, a prepared speech, or anything. People ask questions, and
whatsoever spontaneous response happens in me, I tell it to them. And
because I am not concerned at all about any consistency, I have made it
clear to my people never to say "Yesterday you said this, and today you
are saying this, and these seem to be contradictory." I always insist
whatever I am saying right now is the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PERSON OF CONTRADICTIONS. ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am. Because life is full of contradictions and I am in tune with
life.</p><p>I am not in tune with Aristotle. Aristotle, I think, is a disease. I
call him Aristotle- itis. Life is very different. It is not a logical
system. Now modern physics has come across facts which have baffled all
the scientists because they contradict Aristotle's logic and Euclid's
geometry. They have no obligation to perform according to the logic man
has created. They just go on their way doing their thing in their own
way. I am not a logician, and I have never claimed that I am not a man
of contradictions. I am big enough, as Walt Whitman once said: "I am big
enough to have all the contradictions in me."</p><p>And yet, there is a possibility that all those contradictions may
become a deep harmony. They may not remain contradictions, they may
become complementaries to each other. That's how it is in existence;
that's how it should be in life.</p><p>Now, give him his cigarettes!</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-2>The Last Testament, Vol 1

THINGS CLEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MA ANAND SHEELA HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT THE
WAY WE LIKE THESE DISCUSSIONS GOING. WE DO A COMPLETE WRITE-UP OF WHAT
HAS BEEN SAID, WE EDIT IT, AND THEN SEND THE COMPLETE TEXT TO YOU OR TO
YOUR CONFIDANTS TO BE REEDITED. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE... IF THEY ARE
GOOD, THESE INTERVIEWS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE MUCH OF A QUESTION AND ANSWER
GAME, BUT SOMETHING OF A CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSION WHICH FOR YOU IS ONE
OF THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO GET RID OF A LOT OF PREJUDICES THAT MAY
EXIST AGAINST YOU AND YOUR RELIGION.</p><p>ALSO, THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASKED SOME
THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE, BUT STILL I APOLOGIZE FOR SOME QUESTIONS THAT
PROBABLY YOU HAVE ANSWERED SO MANY TIMES.</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: No problem. You just ask whatsoever you want, and in whatever
way you want. And a question may have been asked thousands of times, but
I have not given the same answer again and again and again. My answer
has been a thousand times different. So you need not be worried; this is
my business. You just ask.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE BEING JUDGED BY THE PUBLIC
SO CONTROVERSIALLY, BECAUSE YOUR ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME ON THE
SAME SUBJECTS.</p><p>A: But I am controversial! It is not a judgment of the public. It is
the reality.</p><p>Q: YOU SAY THAT IT IS NOT YOUR ANSWER THAT CHANGES, IT IS THE REALITY
THAT CHANGES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. It is reality that changes, and I change with reality. I am
certainly controversial. There is nothing wrong about the public
thinking me controversial.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU ARE REALLY ANGRY ABOUT? ANY CONTROVERSIAL
ISSUE?</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'RE BEYOND ALL THIS CONTROVERSY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I just enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS CALL YOU BHAGWAN. HOW SHOULD PEOPLE WHO DO NOT
BELONG TO YOUR GROUP ADDRESS YOU?</p><p>A: They have to address me as Bhagwan. Q: WHAT DOES BHAGWAN MEAN?</p><p>A: The Blessed One.</p><p>Q WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEANINGS OF THE BLESSED ONE, THE
ENLIGHTENED ONE, AND THE AWAKENED ONE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT A BLESSED PERSON IS A CONTINUOUS
LAUGHTER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's true.</p><p>Q: AND ALSO EVERY ENLIGHTENED PERSON IS A CONTINUOUS LAUGHTER?</p><p>A: That's true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU PLEASE FOR OUR AUDIENCE GIVE A BRIEF RUNDOWN OF YOUR
BIOGRAPHY AND YOUR FIRST ENLIGHTENMENT? WHAT HAPPENED? AND HOW?</p><p>A: I don't have any biography. And whatsoever is thought to be
biography is utterly meaningless. On what date I was born, in what
country I was born, does not matter. What matters is what I am now,
right here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SOMETHING THAT MATTERS, FOR INSTANCE, FOR THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION
AUTHORITIES IS WHETHER YOU WERE ADOPTED BY AN INDIAN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN, FOR INSTANCE. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?</p><p>A: Everything has been explained to them. All the documents have been
given to them. Now it is for them to decide. If they decide against me I
am going to fight up to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Q: THAT MEANS THEY HAVE NOT YET ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Four years those lousy people are just sitting there, doing
nothing -- no decision this way or that.</p><p>Q: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENTS HAVE STARTED PURCHASING
PROPERTY IN THE HIMALAYAS. IS THAT TRUE? DO YOU PLAN TO MOVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I don't plan to go anywhere. I am going to be here. Q:
WHATEVER HAPPENS?</p><p>A: Whatever happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I SEE. BUT YOU ARE STILL BUYING PROPERTY IN THE HIMALAYAS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is my Indian followers making a commune there, just as I have
communes all over the world.</p><p>Q: FOR THEIR OWN USE?</p><p>A: For their own use.</p><p>Q: I SEE. THAT MEANS WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU HAVE DECIDED TO FIGHT FOR
YOUR STAYING HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will fight to the very end.</p><p>Q: WILL IT BE A HARD BATTLE?</p><p>A: It is going to be.</p><p>Q: WILL IT BE A LEGAL BATTLE, OR MIGHT THERE BE OTHER MEANS
INVOLVED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I would like it to be legal, but if they force me, then everything
can be involved.</p><p>Q: THAT MEANS EVEN BY WAY OF ARMED RESISTANCE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not from my side.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT FROM THE SIDE OF YOUR SANNYASINS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, not from my sannyasins' side either, that is my side. Q: I
SEE.</p><p>A: But if anybody tries to be violent in any way with us, we are not
nonviolent people. We are neither violent nor nonviolent, we are simply
human beings.</p><p>Q: BUT IF VIOLENCE ERUPTS, YOU ARE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will answer tit for tat.</p><p><br></p><p>Q TIT FOR TAT, JA. OKAY, THAT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION, UH,
ANSWER. WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nothing. Just nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WHERE DO YOU DO NOTHING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just sitting in my room, in my chair, enjoying myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WRITING BOOKS? DID YOU WRITE ALL THESE BOOKS THAT ARE CARRYING
YOUR NAME?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have never read my books. Any of my books.</p><p>Q: AH, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE YOUR GHOST WRITERS, THOUGH?</p><p>A: No, those are my discourses, and my sannyasins edit them. Q: I
SEE</p><p>A: And they are published, but I have never read them. What is the
point? They are my words.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW COME JUST NOW SOMEBODY, WHOM YOU MAY KNOW, HAS PUBLISHED A
THING WHICH IS CALLED The Rajneesh Bible? THAT'S A BIG TITLE FOR A
BOOK.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Bible simply means "the book." It is not a big thing.</p><p>Q: WELL, IT ALSO HAS AN ALLUSION TOWARDS THE FOUNDER OF A RELIGION.
ARE YOU ABOUT TO FOUND A NEW RELIGION NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am the founder of the only religion. All those founders were all
hocus pocus. Q: WHY IS YOURS TRUE?</p><p>A: Because I find them all... Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira --
you name the person and I will show you why he is not the founder of a
religion but is simply exploiting people's gullibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU EXPLORE THAT ON JESUS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Jesus, in the first place, knew nothing of religion. He never
meditated in his life. Whatever he was doing was prayer, and prayer
means you have already accepted the existence of God, to whom you are
praying. Your prayer is based on a belief, and all beliefs are ignorant.
Knowing is something else. If you have experienced a headache, then you
know it; but if the whole world goes on talking about headaches and you
have not experienced it, just for etiquette's sake you may believe in
it. But that belief is ungrounded.</p><p>Q: AND THEY ALSO TAKE AN ASPIRIN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: If you believe too much, perhaps you may take an aspirin. Then
things become worse than before. Jesus' whole ideology is based on
belief.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHERE I SUPPOSE YOURS, I THINK...</p><p><br></p><p>A:... is on experience. I don't say to my people that you have to
believe in anything that I say. I explain to you my experience, you try
to experience. If you</p><p>find it right, there is no question of believing in it. You know it.
If you find it wrong, of course, there is no question of believing it,
either.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: APPARENTLY YOUR RELIGION DOES NOT HAVE A SET OF DOGMAS. A: No.</p><p>Q: HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME SENTENCES WHICH MIGHT, UH, HELP US TO
UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF YOUR RELIGION?</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU TEACH SELFISHNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, because it is natural. And I teach to be natural.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YES. LION EATS MAN... SO DO YOU TEACH THE SURVIVAL OF THE
FITTEST?</p><p>A: It happens. It is not a question of my teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN YOU SAY IT HAPPENS, YOU ARE NEVER CONCERNED WITH WHETHER IT'S
GOOD OR BAD, THESE THINGS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No question of good or bad; there has never been a question of
good and bad. The fittest survives. And the fittest writes all the
histories and all the judgments. And, of course, he is right. Might is
right; and being Germans, you will understand it better.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, YOU'LL MAYBE UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL, AS YOU OCCASIONALLY HAVE
STRONG PREFERENCES FOR HITLER.</p><p>A: I love the man! He was crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO ARE YOU, YOU HAVE SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am more crazy than him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE A BIGGER OR GREATER MAN THAN HIM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, not bigger or greater -- just crazier.</p><p>Q: LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED TO MA SHEELA, I WANTED TO HAVE SOME
CLARIFICATION OF A SENTENCE IN WHICH YOU SAID, "HITLER, IN THE END,
FAILED BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY A TOOL IN THE HANDS OF HIGHER POWERS."</p><p><br></p><p>A: Don't bring in Sheela or anybody. Just I am here; be direct.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:... SHE SAID, "ASK THIS QUESTION TO BHAGWAN, "WHICH I HAVE NOW
DONE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS SENTENCE TO US?</p><p>A: You ask directly, don't bring anybody in. Don't make it
unnecessarily complex, ask directly. Why are you afraid of asking the
question directly?... Afraid of people in Germany?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOT REALLY.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No? Then just ask directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THIS WAS ONLY A POLITE REFERENCE TO MA SHEELA.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Don't be polite to me, because I will not be polite to you. Q: I
WAS ONLY BEING POLITE TO MA SHEELA.…</p><p>A: Ma Sheela is no more concerned here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OKAY. THE QUESTION IS: "HITLER WAS AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF
MAGICAL POWERS. THIS IS WHY HE WAS VICTORIOUS ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN
POINT." WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, AND WHO ARE THESE MAGICAL POWERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Adolf Hitler was very much concerned about astrology. He was not
listening to his generals, where to attack, when to attack. Rather he
was listening to his astrologer, what is the right time, and what is the
right place. And the generals were puzzled because astrologers have
nothing to do with military science. But for five years continuously he
went on winning simply because leaders of the opposite nations --
Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin -- were following the rules of military
science, and he was just going according to something which is not part
of military science. They could not conceive where he was going to
attack. They could not conceive where they should gather their forces.
Finally, Churchill had to import astrologers from India to England.</p><p>Q: APART FROM MILITARY ASPECTS, HOW WOULD YOU JUDGE HIM MORALLY AND
POLITICALLY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Morally, he was as moral as Mahatma Gandhi. Q: AS MAHATMA
GANDHI?</p><p>A: Yes, because I consider both absolutely immoral. In fact, he was
more a Hindu than Mahatma Gandhi himself</p><p>Q: IN WHAT RESPECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In his life. In his way of living.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BECAUSE HE WAS A VEGETARIAN...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He was a vegetarian..</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT HE WAS NOT NONVIOLENT, AS MAHATMA GANDHI WAS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Mahatma Gandhi was also not nonviolent. Just wait a bit; let me
finish with Adolf Hitler. He was a vegetarian. He was an early riser in
the morning, going early back to sleep. He remained a bachelor almost
his whole life -- only three hours before he died, he married. He was
not a drunkard, he was not a smoker. He was a puritan in every possible
way, and he lived a life of discipline, just as a saint lives in a
monastery.</p><p>You ask me if Gandhi was nonviolent. That was a political strategy --
but he was not nonviolent. He had declared that after India became
independent, armies would be dissolved. But when India became
independent and he was asked about armies being dissolved, he remained
silent. He was really a cunning man. His secretary said that it was his
day of silence.</p><p>Q: MAY I DRAW BACK YOUR ATTENTION TO ADOLF HITLER: IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN COMMON WITH HITLER? THERE
WAS A JOKE RELATED BY MA ANAND SHEELA -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRUE.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TOLD THE JOKE OF A TIGER WHO STUCK HIS NOSE
INTO THE ASS OF ANOTHER TIGER AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HE DID THAT, HE
SAID, "WELL I JUST ATE A JEW AND I WANT TO GET RID OF THAT BAD TASTE. "
IS THAT TRUE? IS THAT PROPERLY RELATED, THAT JOKE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It will be good if you don't bring Sheela or anybody in between me
and you. Be direct.</p><p>Q: DID YOU TELL THIS JOKE? IS THAT YOUR JOKE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I cannot remember. For thirty-three years I have been speaking
constantly, two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. Perhaps
there is no single individual alive who has spoken as much as I have
spoken. So, ask the question!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU LIKE JEWS OR DON'T YOU LIKE JEWS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love them -- what is the question of liking? I have among my
sannyasins more Jews than anybody else. Almost forty percent of my
sannyasins are Jews.</p><p>Q: FROM ISRAEL, OR AMERICAN JEWS?</p><p>A: From America, from Israel, from Europe, from Germany.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY NATIONAL, ANY RACIAL PREJUDICES?</p><p>A: I don't believe in the very concept of nations, or religions. I
don't draw any lines between one human being and another. And if I have
told any joke which you think is anti-Jewish, then I have also told
jokes which are anti-Hindu, anti- Mohammedan, anti-Christian. In fact, I
have been telling jokes which are against me! Jokes are just jokes. They
are not a philosophical standpoint.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID YOUR RELIGION IS THE FIRST AND LAST RELIGION. SO, AFTER
YOU THERE WILL BE NO MORE NEED FOR ANY RELIGION ANYWHERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DOES THAT APPLY TO AFTER YOUR DEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I say it is the first and last religion for the simple reason that
I don't consider old religions authentic religions. They were pseudo.
They pretend to be religions, but they were not religions.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BECAUSE THEY WERE RELIGIONS FOR THE POOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Because they were religions of superstition. Not a single
religion has been able to prove God's existence. Not a single religion
has been able to give any proof for heaven and hell.</p><p>Q: THAT DOESN'T MEAN GOD DOESN'T EXIST, IF YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT HE
EXISTS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It does not mean that; it simply means you cannot go on
worshipping something for which no evidence exists in the whole history
of man.</p><p>Q: SO, MAYBE FOR AN OUTSIDER IT IS SOMEHOW CORRECT TO PUT THE CORE OF
YOUR RELIGION INTO THE SENTENCE: FIND YOUR OWN EGO, FIND YOUR OWN
SELF.</p><p>A: NO. Not your own ego, but your own being. And there is a great
difference between the two. Not only different, but they are absolutely
contrary to each other. The ego is the false idea in you created by the
society... you are a Jew, you are a Mohammedan, you are a Nazi, you are
a communist; you belong to this family, this is your holy book, this is
your name. You have to remain attached to your tradition,
convention.</p><p>All these things contribute to your ego. Out of all these your ego is
created... as just a combination. Your being is not given to you by the
society, church, education, family -- nobody. Your being you bring with
yourself when you are born. It is existential.</p><p>Q: IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE SAID -- AND PROBABLY HAVE DONE -- IS THIS WHY
YOU HAVE SAID, "I HAVE TO DESTROY ALL YOUR EGOS"? -- MEANING THE EGOS OF
YOUR FOLLOWERS."</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, THE TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE SITTING RIGHT BEHIND MY NECK HAVE
NO EGO ANYMORE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You can just look and see.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK LIKE IT, BUT YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON
IT, AREN'T YOU? I MEAN, IF THIS IS YOUR AIM, YOUR TARGET... WHEN DO YOU,
THE TEACHER, NOTICE THAT SOMEBODY'S EGO HAS BEEN CRUSHED, DISAPPEARED,
VANISHED, OR WHATEVER HAPPENS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. I immediately recognize it. Q: YOU SENSE IT?</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: DOES YOUR PUPIL SENSE IT? (To the audience): WHEN DID YOU ALL
REALIZE YOUR EGOS HAD BEEN DESTROYED?</p><p>A: My disciples are at several stages of development. Somebody's ego
has completely disappeared, somebody's ego is just on the boundary to
disappear, somebody's ego is still trying to survive, somebody is trying
not to let it go. So they are at all stages. But I try to explain to
them where they are, and where they have to move from there.</p><p>Q: WOULD YOU AGREE TO CALL THIS METHOD OF TREATING PEOPLE
TOTALITARIAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, because I am not giving them any orders to follow me. I am
simply sharing my experience. I have not called them here, they have
come on their own. It is their decision to be with me; it is not my
decision that they should be with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM, MAKE PEOPLE GIVE UP THE FAMILY, THEIR
PROPERTY, THEIR HOME...?</p><p>A: I don't.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU MUST HAVE AN IDEA WHY THEY ARE COMING HERE. I MEAN, THEY
GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY HAD BEFORE JUST TO BE CLOSE TO YOU. THEY GIVE UP
EVEN THEIR OWN PERSONALITY, AND WHAT ARE THEY GETTING FOR IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Whatsoever they feel around me, they are on their own accord ready
to leave everything behind. But I have never told a single person to
leave his family or leave his job. I am not in favor of renunciation.
All the old religions were in favor of renunciation. They were telling
people to leave the family, to remain celibate. They were telling people
to move to the monastery. They were taking people out of the society. I
have never told anybody to do anything on my order. But if, being with
me, they start feeling that something is stupid that they are carrying
and they drop it, that is their business.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE COMING FROM WESTERN
CIVILIZATIONS -- FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM WESTERN EUROPE -- BUT
HARDLY ANYONE IS COMING FROM YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY, HARDLY ANY INDIANS.
OR AM I WRONG?</p><p>A: India is a dead country.</p><p>Q: MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Both.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ECONOMICALLY, OF COURSE, AS WELL. A COUNTRY WITH SUCH A BIG
CULTURAL TRADITION, YOU CALL IT MENTALLY DEAD?</p><p>A: It was once, but for two thousand years slavery.…</p><p>Q: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TAX CASE, BY THE WAY? IS THERE ANY NEW
DEVELOPMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have no idea, because I have never paid any tax. I have no
income, either. Q: YOU HAVE NO INCOME?</p><p>A: No income.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT ARE YOU LIVING ON THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just my friends -- I am their guest. I have been a guest for
thirty-five years continuously -- in fact my whole life. In the
beginning I was a guest in my family, and after that I have been a guest
in other families.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JUST ONE MORE QUESTION CONCERNING THE MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE COMING
TO JOIN YOU, TO JOIN RANKS WITH YOU. I HAVE THE FEELING THAT PRINCIPALLY
FRUSTRATED WESTERN YOUTH ARE COMING WHO SEEM TO BE THE MORE OBEDIENT
KIND OF CUSTOMERS, WHO DON'T ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS. AREN'T THE INDIANS,
FOR INSTANCE, MORE PRACTICALLY MINDED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Do you think you are an Indian? Q: NO, NO.</p><p>A: Do you see anybody here more frustrated than you? Q: NO, NO.</p><p>A: You go to the commune and see if you can find a single frustrated
person.</p><p>Q: NOT HERE, BUT THEY SEEM TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH WESTERN
CIVILIZATION.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are dissatisfied because they are intelligent people. Only
buffalos don't get frustrated.</p><p>Q: YOU FIND A NUMBER OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY,
TOO. WHY DON'T YOU ATTRACT ANY OF THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I'm telling you, India is a dead country. And everything which is
born has to die one day. Even civilizations are born and they have to
die. But it is very difficult for people to drop the corpses of the
ancient past, their glory, their tradition. They go on carrying the
corpses on their shoulders. They are very traditional, very orthodox,
and completely closed to anything new. They have the idea that their
scriptures have all the truth that is possible There is no need for
them.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE HAVE THE IMPRESSION THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE</p><p>-- I'LL SAY IT, I DON'T MEAN IT NEGATIVELY -- SOME KIND OF DROPOUTS
OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I READ A BOOK BY ANDRES ELTEN AND HE DESCRIBED EXACTLY THE FEELING
THAT HE WAS DISSATISFIED COMPLETELY WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AND.…</p><p>A: Will you call Jean-Paul Sartre a dropout? Q: WHO?</p><p>A: Jean-Paul Sartre. Will you call Bertrand Russell a dropout? Q: IN
THE WESTERN SENSE, JA.</p><p>A: Bertrand Russell, a dropout?</p><p>Q: IN THE WESTERN SENSE, JA, I WOULD CALL HIM A DROPOUT</p><p><br></p><p>A: In no sense can you call Bertrand Russell a dropout. You give on
the one hand the Nobel prize to the man, and on the other hand you call
him a dropout.</p><p>Q: WELL, LIFE IS FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.</p><p>A: I understand perfectly what you mean. Anybody who is intelligent,
is a little aware of the situation of the world, of the society, of the
family, is bound to be a dropout. Dropping out is absolutely positive.
If the house is on fire, you run out of it. That is not escapist.</p><p>Q: BUT YOUR WAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO SALVATION, YOU FEEL?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I don't say that I'm the only savior, or the only salvation,
but.… Q: WHAT ALTERNATIVE WOULD YOU SUGGEST THEN?</p><p>A: I don't suggest any alternative.</p><p>Q: WELL, YOU CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF WHAT YOU NEW MAN.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: I simply explain to them what I have experienced, and if they feel
themselves somehow falling into a kind of synchronicity with me, then it
is up to them. Whether they want to be with me or go back to their
home... I never persuade anybody to be here; I never prevent anybody
from going. It is all up to them. This commune is completely free.</p><p>Q: BUT YET, YOU ARE TRYING TO FORM THE NEW MAN, AS YOU SAY. THAT'S
WHAT YOU WROTE.</p><p>A: I am trying to form a new man. It is just an idea, it is not that
a new man can be made like a sculpture. I am just explaining what a new
man should be.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EXPLICATIONS BY LENIN, BY MARX, EVEN BY ADOLF
HITLER, BUT NO ONE EVER MANAGED TO REALLY CREATE THE NEW MAN.…</p><p>A: Because all their ideas were not right, they did not fit with
existence, they all failed.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR NEW MAN AND NIETZSCHE'S
SUPERMAN?</p><p>A: Superman is a fascist idea. A new man is not superior in any way.
A new man is really the most ordinary and simple man. Just try to
understand one thing: that I want man to live naturally, ordinarily,
without trying to become superior, without going into a pilgrimage
towards paradise. Just be here and now, and enjoy whatsoever life gives
to you. Be creative, be intelligent -- but this is not</p><p>making you a superman. Nietzsche's superman created Adolf Hitler and
the whole stupidity that followed. The new man is not the superman.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF BHAGWAN DIES? WILL THERE BE A SUCCESSOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Who cares?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is up to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WILL THEY VOTE FOR ONE? WILL THERE BE AN ELECTION?</p><p>A: I have nothing to do with it. The moment I die.… Q: HOW WILL HE BE
CHOSEN?</p><p>A: You have to understand me: I don't CARE.</p><p>Q: SO YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR YOUR CHURCH?</p><p>A: No responsibility whatsoever, because every responsibility makes
them slaves. Then I am totalitarian.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ONCE YOU SAID WHEN YOU GO, "MANY OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME." WHAT DID
THAT MEAN IN PARTICULAR? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: When did I say it?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OH, I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SAID IT, BUT I READ IT FROM ONE OF YOUR
SCRIPTS. IT WAS..."IF I GO MANY OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME." DOES THAT MEAN
THAT IF YOU DECEASE THAT OTHERS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. If you have read somewhere, you must have read wrongly, out of
context.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE IT KEEPS CROPPING UP IN
THE BIBLE, AS WELL. YOU ARE STRONGLY FOR WHAT YOU CALL DEATH CONTROL --
EUTHANASIA, ISN'T THAT THE ENGLISH WORD? -- DEATH CONTROL. A MAN HAS THE
RIGHT TO GO TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO BE FREED FROM HIS BODY, THIS SORT OF
THING.</p><p>A Yes.</p><p>Q: SO THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO KEEP TO THIS TOPIC. ALSO, YOUR FIRST
ENLIGHTENMENT STARTED WITH A.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: You are not keeping to any topic at all. I am trying to keep you.…
Q: I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MY READERS, NOT ONLY YOU.</p><p>A: I am not concerned with your readers. I am concerned only with the
truth that I can impart to you.</p><p>Q: WHAT'S TRUTHFUL ABOUT DEATH CONTROL THEN?</p><p>A: Once birth control is there, death control has to be there. It is
just the logical consequence of birth control. If you try to control
birth, you are only trying to control on one end. What about the other
end? You are preventing new children being born; it becomes absolutely
necessary that people should not be just vegetating in hospitals. They
want to die; if they want to die, this is their birthright. And all
medical facilities should be provided to these people.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I THINK I HAVE THE VERY POINT HERE. THE RAJNEESH TIMES QUOTED YOU
JUST RECENTLY, SAYING, "I TEACH YOU TO REALIZE SUICIDE SO THAT YOU CAN
GO FOREVER." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE TEACHING
SUICIDE AS PART OF YOUR RELIGION? IS IT DESIRABLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am simply saying that nothing is wrong with death. It is as
beautiful as life. If you have lived, and you feel that now life has no
more to give to you, and you feel that you are tired, exhausted and
spent, then what is the point of forcing you to drag on because an old
idiot, Hippocrates, created the medical oath for doctors that they
should always try to save the man? The man wants to die; he is hanging
between life and death, and they go on trying every way to keep him
alive. Who are you?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WILL YOU COMMIT SUICIDE ALSO, UNDER A CERTAIN CONDITION?</p><p>A: If I feel like it, if I feel like now there is no work for me, I
will. There is no problem in it. I am Master of my own self; nobody is
to control me.</p><p>Q: AND WILL YOU ENCOURAGE SOMEONE ELSE TO FOLLOW YOU?</p><p>A: No. I never encourage about anything. I simply explain myself, I
never encourage anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ARE A GREAT ADMIRER OF VINCENT VAN GOGH, THE DUTCH PAINTER,
THE ONE WITH THE EAR. YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE, "HE COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR
THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAD PAINTED EVERYTHING HE HAD WANTED TO PAINT.
SO TO THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS SUICIDE, NOT TO ME. TO ME IT SIMPLY SEEMS
A NATURAL END. THE PAINTING IS COMPLETED, LIFE IS FULFILLED."</p><p>A: Yes, absolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO OWN A PAINTING BY VAN GOGH, IN
ADDITION TO YOUR NINETY ROLLS ROYCES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I own nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WHO IS THERE TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS EUTHANASIA SHOULD BE DONE?
IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION -- MAYBE NOT FOR YOU -- BUT IF DEATH CONTROL
IS EXERTED, WHO SHOULD DO IT? A COMMITTEE OF DOCTORS? A LAWYER? A
POLITICIAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Politicians, certainly not. Legal experts have no business in
deciding about life and death. But the medical profession should be
freed from the Hippocratic oath; that their function is just to save,
whatsoever the situation. They should be allowed... their function is to
serve, whatsoever the condition. If the person is still capable of
living a meaningful life, if he is still wanting to live, if he has
still the lust for life, help him. But if a person has nothing to live
for and he is telling you that it is time for him to be freed from this
body.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, HE MAY HAVE REGRETTED IT NEXT DAY.</p><p>(BOTH JOURNALISTS CONTINUE TO TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY. )</p><p><br></p><p>A: You go on interfering with each other!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: (FIRST JOURNALIST): BUT WE'RE SPONTANEOUS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.…</p><p>Q: (SECOND JOURNALIST): YOU KEEP SAYING YOU HAVE NO INFLUENCE AT ALL,
AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE, BUT YOU KEEP WRITING THICK
BOOKS. AND YOU'RE HOLDING INTERVIEWS.</p><p>A: I will continue, but I am not trying to influence anybody.</p><p>Q: BUT CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU DO...?
MR. TEERTHA SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, "IF BHAGWAN TOLD ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE,
I WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE A GUN AND KILL MYSELF." IS THAT A REAL EVIL
KIND OF INFLUENCE?</p><p>A: What he is saying is his side. He is not saying that I am going to
tell him, because I don't tell anybody even to drink a glass of water or
a cup of tea.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF INFLUENCING PEOPLE, JUST.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I am not. I am consistently making them alert not to be
influenced by me. I may be wrong. What that man has said IS HIS
trust.</p><p>Q: THERE IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY YOU. THE TITLE IS Dying for</p><p>Enlightenment.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's perfectly good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JA, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL ENCOURAGED BY SUCH
A TITLE, AND WHAT IT CONTAINS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. That dying means the death of your ego.</p><p>Q: THE DEATH AND ENLIGHTENMENT THROUGH DEATH.</p><p>A: Yes, that means the death of your ego... not the death of you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ANOTHER THING YOU TRY TO DESTROY IS CONSCIENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, the conscience that has been created by the society; because
only that is the way to free his consciousness. And these are two
different things, except in the French language. In the French language,
there is only one word, CONSCIENCE for both consciousness and
conscience. But they are two different things. Consciousness the child
brings with himself Conscience is given by the society, the family, the
educational system and everybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, IF HE IS FREED, IF SOMEBODY IS COMPLETELY FREED OF CONSCIENCE,
HE MIGHT GO AROUND AND DO REALLY HARMFUL THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: What?</p><p>Q: ISN'T IT CONSCIENCE THAT REFRAINS PEOPLE FROM GOING ROUND HURTING
OTHER PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is conscience that has been creating all the wars in the world
and killing millions of people.</p><p>Q: MAYBE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSCIENCE.</p><p>A: All the consciences: Mohammedans have done that, Hindus have done
that, Christians have done that. For three thousand years there have
been five thousand wars in the world, and they are still preparing for
the third, total war. This is the conscience of your presidents, of your
prime ministers, of your leaders, of your popes, of your priests. A man
of consciousness cannot do anything wrong. It is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS MOTHER TERESA A WOMAN OF CONSCIENCE? I AM JUST MENTIONING THE
NAME BECAUSE I HAVE A QUOTE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Can't you find anybody better?</p><p>Q: IT'S VERY GOOD FOR A START, THAT REMARK; AND YOU CALLED HER, BY
GOD, CRIMINALLY MINDED AND IDIOTIC...!</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY OF CALLING SOMEONE WHO DEDICATES
HIS LIFE TO HELPING THE MISERABLE IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The people who devote themselves to helping the miserable keep
misery alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGHT IT, AT LEAST.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. They are simply exploiting the misery for their own glory.
Misery can be destroyed completely, but it cannot be destroyed by Mother
Teresa. Mother Teresa wants more orphans. Mother Teresa wants more poor
people so that she can convert those people to Catholicism. It is sheer
politics. All the religions have been exploiting and doing the same
thing. I don't make any distinction between those religions.</p><p>Q: YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE GOOD HEARTEDNESS AS...?</p><p>A: No, not at all. I approve only of one thing: If you have plenty --
abundant life, joy, anything -- and you want to share it, and if that
sharing is a joy to you, share it. It does not matter with whom you
share. Whether the other person is rich or poor, Hindu or Mohammedan,
Western or Eastern, if you are full of fragrance, you will share it.
There is no other way. When the cloud is full of rain water, it
showers.</p><p>I do not teach serving the poor, I teach destroying poverty. And we
have all the means in our hands to destroy all poverty. But the
politicians will not allow, the priests will not allow, because they
both will disappear with poverty, remember.</p><p>Q: WHO IS "WE" -- MANKIND, OR THE RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I mean the intelligence of mankind. I am not a Rajneeshee.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I STILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD BE A
BIG STEP FORWARD FOR MANKIND IF CONSCIENCE IS DESTROYED.</p><p><br></p><p>A: All that conscience has done up to now has been simply ugly,
destructive. We need a better concept, and that is consciousness.
Consciousness is a purification of your being through meditative
methods. That's my whole work. Then whatever a conscious man does is
right. Then there is no question of choosing for him.</p><p>Q: HE MAY KILL?</p><p>A: If he feels it right, he may kill.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S QUITE FAR AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: You are not civilized. And where is civilization? Q: RIGHT HERE...
IN AMERICA.</p><p>A: Nowhere does civilization exist. It is just an idea that humanity
has been hoping for. What exists is barbarism with clothes covering it,
masks hiding the real faces of people. But true civilization does not
exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY? ANYBODY WHO HAS REACHED
CONSCIOUSNESS MAY KILL IF HE FEELS LIKE IT?</p><p>A: I am saying the man who has become totally conscious cannot do
anything wrong. Whatever he does is right. There is no question of
choosing right and wrong.</p><p>Q: UNREGARDING OF THE EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY...?</p><p>A: There is no question for him. He sees where the door is, and he
moves. He has eyes of his own; he does not need to borrow eyes and
insight from others.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT MEANS, IN PRACTICAL TERMS, IF IT COMES TO THE WORST, AND THE
OREGON POLICE SENDS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POLICEMEN TO SEND YOU OUT FROM
HERE BECAUSE OF SOME LEGAL REASONS, YOU WOULD RESIST BY MEANS OF ARMS
AND EVEN ON THE RISK OF KILLING PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will decide in the moment. We never plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IF IT HAPPENS, YOU WOULD BE PREPARED TO KILL PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. We will see at the moment what we can do, whether it is right
to stand before them with our chests open and tell them to kill us and
prove that they are civilized, and prove that they are democratic.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YES, PROVIDED THIS IS A CIVILIZED DEMOCRACY.</p><p>A: It is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE AMERICAN SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No society anywhere is yet civilized.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I SEE. THAT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT
OF AN OREGONIAN JUDGE IF HE DECIDES TO EXPEL YOU...?</p><p>A: I have seen their judgments.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE IF THEY DECIDE TO EXPEL YOU, YOU
WOULD RESIST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will resist, certainly.</p><p>Q: BY ANY MEANS AVAILABLE?</p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p>Q: EVEN ON THE RISK OF CREATING BLOODSHED -- LIKE JONESTOWN?</p><p>A: It does not matter. Nothing matters if somebody is being nasty to
innocent people who are not doing any harm to anybody. Then, whatever
happens.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YES, IN A DEMOCRACY IT'S UP TO THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO DECIDE
WHAT IS HARMFUL AND WHAT IS NOT.</p><p>A: We will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court of America, and
even if we see that.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, IF YOU LOSE THERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Then we will fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WITH THE ARMS YOU ARE COLLECTING ALREADY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. We don't have arms to fight America.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO WHAT ARE THE ARMS FOR? THEY SAY YOU HAVE ARMS FOR -- I READ THE
QUOTE SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT WAS FROM A SENATOR -- HE SAID "THEY HAVE
ARMS FOR A COMBAT REGIMENT, LIKE A COMBAT REGIMENT IN VIETNAM." WHAT ARE
THE ARMS FOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just two dozen arms for the police, which are declared to the
government? You think they are enough to fight America? Then what is the
Soviet Union doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU MEAN THE TWO DOZEN GUNS YOU HAVE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are just cowards.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY SAID IT'S ENOUGH FOR A REGIMENT IN VIETNAM, THAT'S HOW IT
WAS</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. They are absolutely absurd.</p><p>Q: YOU ARE SUCH A LOVING COMMUNITY, WHY DOES YOUR POLICE FORCE NEED
ARMS?</p><p>A: We are such a loving community, that's why. We don't want this
loving community to be destroyed by idiots. In these four years in this
commune, no crime has happened, no drug has entered in, no theft has
happened, no murder has happened, nobody has been raped... no violence.
These few arms and policemen are part of the Oregon government.</p><p>Q: JUST IN CASE A CRIME WOULD HAPPEN, DO YOU HAVE THE JUDICIAL MEANS
TO DEAL WITH THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We have every judicial means. We have four hundred sannyasins who
are legal experts. Perhaps nowhere else will you find such a big legal
firm. And these four hundred legal experts are going to fight to the
very end.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS "DEVIATION" TREATED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Hmm?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He is just taken to the hospital. Q: AGAINST HIS WILL?</p><p>A: Otherwise he is told to leave. If he does not want to live here in
communion with people, he is free to leave. If he wants to live in
communion here, and if the community feels that something is wrong in
him, he goes to the hospital. And in four years, nobody has resisted,
nobody has been taken to the hospital forcibly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DO PERFORM YOUR OWN BIRTH... WELL, YOUR OWN MARRIAGE AND DEATH
CEREMONIES. WOULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE THEM TO US?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I do not perform anything, my people do everything. I am just a
non-doer, just good for nothing. My people do everything. If they want
to perform marriage, they will perform marriage. If they want to perform
divorce, they will perform divorce. It is up to them, their business,
nothing to do with me. I am completely an outsider. Let me repeat, I am
not a Rajneeshee. I don't live even in the City of Rajneeshpuram. I live
outside in a guest house. I am not a resident.</p><p>Q: WELL, AT LEAST THEY DON'T GIVE YOU DOG TAGS, LIKE THEY DO WITH
OTHER VISITORS.</p><p>A: I'm not a visitor.</p><p>Q: WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IT SEEMS SOMEHOW SIMPLY STYLISH AND VERY
COQUETTE TO SAY, "I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COMMUNITY."</p><p>A: It is true, so what else can I say? I have nothing to do. I have
never performed a single marriage, I have never gone to any service for
somebody who has died.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IF YOU DRIVE ALONG THE STREET, THEY STAND AND CHEER.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is their business and their joy. Just now they were standing
outside; I had not asked anybody to stand there, and they will be
standing still, just open the door and see. And nobody is telling them.
Two hours those loving people will be waiting for me.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YEAH. YOU SAID ONCE, "IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE A PART OF MY COMMUNE,
YOU ARE TAKING A RISK." WHAT KIND OF RISK DOES EVERYBODY TAKE WHO JOINS
YOU?</p><p>A: The risk is of dropping all rubbish that everybody carries and
thinks is very valuable -- all kinds of crap. Your religion will
disappear, your nationality will disappear, your whole idea of racism
will disappear. Your belief systems, your political ideologies will
disappear. Here you will be just a simple, innocent human being. I
believe in the individual.</p><p>Q: INNOCENCE ALSO MEANS IRRESPONSIBILITY.</p><p>A: Yes. It means both. It means irresponsibility to those who have
been forcing responsibility on you. But in fact it means responsibility,
because a person who is totally free, whatever he does he is responsible
for. He cannot say, "My commander-in-chief ordered me," that "It was
from the pope, what can I do?" "It is from Jesus, the only begotten son
of God." He has nobody to dump anything on. All responsibility is his,
so whatsoever he does, he has to take the responsibility upon his own
shoulders. So to him it means responsibility, but certainly to others it
will look like irresponsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PERHAPS HE CAN ALSO BE MANIPULATED EASIER.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Everybody is being manipulated everywhere and very easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOW LET'S COME BACK TO ONE MORE PRACTICAL TERM. TWO DAYS AGO YOU
WERE ASKED WHETHER YOU WERE TRYING TO SPREAD YOUR</p><p>POWER, OR YOUR INFLUENCE, OVER THE WHOLE OF OREGON. YOU SAID YOU WANT
TO TRY TO SPREAD IT OVER ALL OF THE UNITED STATES. WAS THAT
MISUNDERSTOOD?</p><p>A: No. These are not my words. They had asked, "Are you going to take
over Oregon?" The question is stupid, and a stupid question does not
need.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR HONEST REPLY TO THAT STUPID QUESTION?</p><p>A: I told the person that I would love them to take over the whole
world. Oregon is too small.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THERE IS AT LEAST A CERTAIN RISK FOR THE OREGONIANS. I MEAN,
NOT THAT YOU'D TAKE OVER THE WHOLE OF OREGON.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no risk for anybody from my people. Q: BUT THEY FEEL IT'S
A RISK.</p><p>A: They are just cowards.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU BROUGHT IN TRUCKLOADS OF DISPLACED PERSONS AND DRUNKARDS
AND WHAT NOT JUST TO INCREASE YOUR VOTING POWER. CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF YOUR TACTICS?</p><p>A: We did not vote at all! They were absolutely creating the whole
situation. Q: BUT WHY DID YOU BRING IN ALL THESE PEOPLE?</p><p>A: They are still here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JA, BUT THEY WERE NOT SANNYASINS... ARE THEY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: A few of them are still here. A few of them have become
sannyasins. Those who wanted to leave, they left. We brought them
because we wanted to share something with them. Next year we will bring
someone else. Next year... every year after our annual celebration we
have enough money to share.</p><p>Q: OR IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THIS COINCIDED WITH THE ELECTION
DATE?</p><p>A: It was just a coincidence, and we did not vote at all.</p><p>Q: SO IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF COINCIDENCE WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THAT
YOU WERE ADOPTED... WHEN IT JUST CAME IN HANDY FOR THE IMMIGRATION
AUTHORITIES?</p><p>A: No. It is not a question of my declaring it. I was myself not
aware up to that point that I was adopted in my childhood. It was a
secret pact between Swami Swarupananda and my father. They were friends.
And it was just superstitious astrology. Astrologers said that if I was
not given in adoption I would die, and I should be given to somebody who
does not belong to my family, does not even belong to my caste, to my
religion... somebody utterly a stranger.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT SOMEBODY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT ALL THE WAY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Only Swami Swarupananda and my father. Those two persons knew it
all the way. My father is dead, now Swarupananda is the only person who
knows, and who has all the documents. So when he declared, I came to
know about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, I'M QUITE AMAZED BY THAT HIGH RATE OF COINCIDENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not a coincidence. It happens in India every day. If people
are told by astrologers that their children will die, it is good to let
them be adopted that way they think they are going to deceive the stars
and death, and everything. It is foolish, but it happens every day. And
they kept it a secret pact between themselves.…</p><p>Q: UNTIL THEY COULD USE IT, OR UNTIL SOMEBODY COULD USE IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: There was no question.… Yes, my father told Swarupananda, "If
there is any need any day, you are authorized, he is your son."</p><p>Q: WE HAVE STILL TWO, THREE MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICTS. YOU PREDICTED
WORLD WAR THREE FOR SOME TIME, FOR SOME UNDISCLOSED YEAR BETWEEN 1984, I
THINK, AND 1999. HAVE YOU GOT ANY MORE PRECISE IDEA NOW? I MEAN, COULD
YOU PREDICT EXACTLY WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. It is not a prediction. Q: OR YOUR FEELING?</p><p>A: It is simple reasoning.</p><p>Q: A VISION.… HOW...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. It is not a vision.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT HOW REAL IS THE VISION? COULD WE RELY ON IT, OR IS IT JUST AN
IDEA?</p><p>A: I don't say rely on it. I am an unreliable man. What I said is a
simple, logical conclusion of the world situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: A CONCLUSION OF WHAT? OF POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE RECENT YEARS?</p><p>A: Yes. The political events, the nuclear weapons.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR IN MIND: SDI, OR AMEX OR
PERSHING, OR WHATEVER IT IS?</p><p>A: No. It is just the whole mess in which the humanity is. And the
politicians go on creating more and more weapons to kill; sooner or
later they are going to explode.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JA, BUT YOU COULDN'T SAY WHO IS MORE RESPONSIBLE, AND WHO IS NOT
SO RESPONSIBLE...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Everybody is responsible.</p><p>Q: YOU GOT SOME ADVICE FOR THE POLITICIANS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: One piece of advice: that all nations should dissolve into one
global government. The only way to avoid the third world war is that
there are no more nations, but only one world.</p><p>Q: IN THAT CONTEXT YOU HAVE SAID YOU WERE GOING TO SAVE THE ELITE OF
THE WORLD BY CREATING UNDERGROUND SHELTERS. FURTHERMORE, THAT ONLY
SANNYASINS WILL SURVIVE THAT WAR, AND THAT ALL THE REST OF MANKIND WILL
PERISH OR COMMIT SUICIDE OR WILL DEGENERATE INTO MONKEYS. SO, ARE THESE
THE PROSPECTS OF WHAT THE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER THAT WAR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: If the war happens, then only a few people are going to survive.
Perhaps even they will not survive.</p><p>Q: AND THE SANNYASINS WILL SURVIVE, YOU SAID? ARE YOU PREPARING FOR
IT? ARE YOU CONSTRUCTING SHELTER, A NUCLEAR- PROOF SHELTER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The state is preventing us from making anything -- from making
even a house. And we are fighting the case in court.</p><p>Q: WELL, I MEAN, ARE YOU BUILDING BUNKERS FOR...?</p><p>A: We will make them once our case is finished.… Q: YOU WILL START
BUILDING.…</p><p>A: We will.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NUCLEAR-PROOF BUNKERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will. I would love my people to survive.</p><p>Q: BUT, I MEAN, ARE YOU TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We are fighting in the court. What more practical steps right now
do you want me to take?</p><p>Q: NO, PRACTICAL STEPS AGAINST DYING IN A HOLOCAUST -- NOT AGAINST
SURVIVING IN RAJNEESHPURAM, AGAINST BEING EXPELLED FROM RAJNEESHPURAM.
ARE YOU PART OF THE PEACE MOVEMENT, THIS SORT OF THING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I am not interested in the peace movement. They have never
succeeded, and they are utter nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT TRUE WHEN THE RAJNEESH TIMES WROTE "EVERYONE WHO DIES IN
RAJNEESHPURAM OR WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR MILES OF ITS BOUNDARIES WILL BE
ENLIGHTENED"?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT TRUE? WHAT IS EXACTLY MEANT BY TWENTY-FOUR MILES? WHY NOT
TWENTY-TWO?</p><p>A: At one hundred degrees, water evaporates. Why not at ninety-nine?
It is simply a law of existence that if there is one man in the state of
absolute enlightenment, his being there creates a certain vibe in a
twenty-four-mile radius around him. In that radius.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN BEFORE? WHEN BUDDHA DIED, OR...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, Buddha also had exactly the same twenty-four mile radius. Q:
WHAT ABOUT JESUS?</p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: MOHAMMED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS?</p><p>A: None, except Buddha. Q: AND YOU.</p><p>A: There have been many others whose names are not known; but these
people, Jesus, Moses or Mohammed were not enlightened themselves. But
there have been many: for example, Kabir, in India; Farid, a Mohammedan
in India; Bodhidharma, an Indian in China; ChuangTzu, a Chinese; LaoTzu,
a Chinese. It has happened around many people in different countries,
and I have spoken on all these people. There are at least 350 books that
I have spoken and I have talked about these people, their methods, what
happened in their lives, and what happened in their death.</p><p>But these people, Mohammed, Moses, Jesus were themselves not
enlightened. Jesus was a mental case, thinking that he is the only
begotten son of God, thinking that he is the savior of the whole world,
telling his people that he will come back to save them. And the things
that he did-condemning, cursing a fig tree because he and his disciples
were hungry and the fig tree was not welcoming them with fruits. And it
was not the season, it was not any responsibility of the fig tree, and
this man curses the fig tree. You think this man is sane?</p><p>Q: THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION -- NOT A VERY PHILOSOPHICAL ONE,
BUT A QUESTION THAT INTERESTS LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE AND READERS IN
EUROPE. IN POONA YOU</p><p>FAVORED UNLIMITED SEX AS A KIND OF BIRTHRIGHT. AND SO, AS IT LOOKS,
IT WAS EXERCISED. NOW, AS IT LOOKS TO US, AND AS I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT
I READ, IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER THE CONTRARY. YOU SAY SEX IS ONLY ALLOWED
WITH RUBBER GLOVES AND EVEN KISSING IS FORBIDDEN. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND SO MUCH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because of that fact of life. In Poona I had said to my people
that sex is simple, natural, a joyous game... you can enjoy it; don't
take it seriously. It is not sin; it is not a crime, but don't impose
yourself upon anybody. Two persons willing to be together, it is
absolutely their right to enjoy a sexual meeting.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU'D RATHER SEE THAT THEY TURN IT INTO CONSCIOUSNESS, YOU
SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. I would love that slowly their meditation grows so that even
while making love.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LIKE THE CHRISTIAN MONKS IN THE MONASTERIES...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Christian monks in the monasteries have been masturbating and
nothing else. Q: THEY ARE NOT TURNING IT INTO CONSCIOUSNESS?</p><p>A: They cannot because they are repressive people. If you repress
your sex, you can never become meditative. The moment you become silent,
immediately sexual fantasies will come up.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT A MATTER OF AGE OR IS IT A MATTER OF STAGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
OR WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? I MEAN, YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT OPPOSING IT DIRECTLY,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T FAVOR IT THE SAME WAY AS YOU DID IN POONA. IS THAT
RIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is exactly the same as it was in Poona. Their sexual freedom is
there, but a new disease, AIDS, is spreading. Now we have to take
account of it, and to my people I have said that if you want.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW IS YOUR OWN SEX LIFE? ARE YOU STILL ACTIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My sex life?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU WERE ACTIVE BEFORE IN POONA?</p><p>A: I have been active all my life. But now it is enough. I'm finished
with it. I enjoyed it before my enlightenment, and I enjoyed it more
after my enlightenment. And I proved one traditional idea wrong: that an
enlightened man cannot enjoy sex. It is something of historical
importance. But now I am completely satisfied. Too much!</p><p>Q: YOU'RE NOT A VERY HEALTHY MAN THESE DAYS, ARE YOU?</p><p>A: I am not. My body is fragile. My back is bad.</p><p>Q: WILL YOU HAVE TO UNDERGO ANOTHER OPERATION, OR...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Every possibility is always there, because I have allergies to
many things: dust, perfume, smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAS IT BECOME WORSE FROM THE TIME YOU CAME HERE, OR HAS IT
IMPROVED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, it has improved. Oregon's dry climate has been immensely
helpful. I am grateful to Oregon not to Oregonians -- my asthma has
almost disappeared because there is no humidity around, and my back is
perfectly good.</p><p>Q: HOW ARE YOU MEDICALLY TREATED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have my own two physicians.</p><p>Q: DO THEY DO MASSAGE, OR WHAT DO THEY DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Medically, if my back is bad, as it was in India... then they
were massaging it, giving me traction, giving me medicines for it. For
my asthma they were giving me medicines. So whenever it is needed,
whatsoever is needed.…</p><p>Q: SO YOU ARE NOT OPPOSED TO PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not at all. I am absolutely in favor of all sciences, and I am
against all religions.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAY I PLEASE JUMP BACK IN DISCUSSION TO A POINT WE HAD SOME TIME
AGO: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DOCTORS AND YOU SAID THEY SHOULD BE FREED OF
THE OATH OF HIPPOCRATES, IN FAVOR OF SCIENCE. NOW, IF DOCTORS ARE NOT
BOUND BY THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH THEY CAN DO HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, CAN'T THEY?
IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT TO EXPERIMENT WITH HUMAN BEINGS?</p><p>A: It is absolutely right. In fact, it is needed. Not to experiment
with human beings is dangerous.</p><p>Q: EXPERIMENTS WITH HUMAN BEINGS OFTEN ARE BROUGHT ABOUT AGAINST
THEIR OWN WILL. SO, FOR SCIENCE ONE SHOULD SACRIFICE HUMAN BEINGS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not a question of sacrificing; just people like Mother
Teresa should offer themselves in the service of humanity. And there are
six hundred million Catholics; they should offer.…</p><p>Q: I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT INDIA AND MOTHER TERESA, BUT ABOUT HUMAN
ENGINEERING.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am also talking about human engineering. You were saying,
"Should people be forced against their will?" No, but people can be
invited. And there will be enough people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SHOULD THEY BE FORCED TO BE STERILIZED IF POPULATIONWISE, IT'S
NECESSARY, LIKE IT HAPPENED IN INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: If the population becomes a problem for the whole country, then it
is up to the country to decide. They should vote for it, for absolute
birth control.</p><p>Q: YOU ARE FOR IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not for it. I'm saying THAT country should vote for it; the
whole country should decide if they want to die starving. It is up to
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU FAVOR STERILIZATION...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not against anybody's will.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOT AGAINST HIS WILL BUT, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD YOU TRY TO PERSUADE
SOMEBODY HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM BECAUSE THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN DO NOT
FIT INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS COMMUNITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I never persuade. I simply explain the situation and my people are
intelligent enough that there is no need for persuasion.</p><p>Q: DO THEY EXERCISE STERILIZATION HERE?</p><p>A: Not a single baby has been born here in four years.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DUE TO STERILIZATION OF WOMEN HERE, OR IS IT...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Every kind of birth control method is being used.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS STERILIZATION A VERY WIDESPREAD KIND HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In India it was.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND IN RAJNEESHPURAM? A: No.</p><p>Q: NOT MANY WOMEN ARE STERILIZED BECAUSE OF THE NOT WANTED
CONSEQUENCES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, they can use other birth control methods. There is no
question.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THAT THE WAY YOUR RELATION TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY WORKS? YOU
EXPLAIN THE SITUATION, AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE DRAWS THE CONSEQUENCES AND
DOES THE DIRTY WORK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Everybody has to take his responsibility. I simply.… Q: EXCEPT
FOR YOU.…</p><p>A: ... explain the situation, the consequences. And everybody has to
think for himself, what he would like.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND YOU CALL THAT NOT HAVING INFLUENCE ON THE COMMUNITY?</p><p>A: It is absolute democracy. Nowhere does it exist except here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I MAY BE OLD FASHIONED, BUT MY NOTION OF DEMOCRACY WAS TWO PEOPLE
ARGUING A POINT AND REACHING A CONCLUSION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: But when you have somebody who can see the light, then of course
he is not going to grope like a blind man. Your idea of democracy is the
idea of people who are blind. So blind people are arguing about the
shape of the elephant; they</p><p>are arguing about whether light exists or not. And to what conclusion
can they ever come?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY DOES, IT WORKS
THE OTHER WAY ROUND, TOO, BECAUSE BASICALLY YOUR COMMUNE ISN'T
RESPONSIBLE EITHER. SO NOBODY IN THIS VALLEY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
ANYTHING.</p><p>A: Everybody is responsible for himself. Nobody is responsible for
anybody else. That's why I don't call it even a community. I call it a
commune. And I make a distinction between the two words. A community is
a certain kind of contract between people. A commune is open, without
any contract.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JA, IT'S LAWLESSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is lawlessness, because there is no need of law.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TELL ME ONE MORE QUESTION: HOW CAN A COMMUNITY SURVIVE WITHOUT THE
FAMILY, WITHOUT CHILDREN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is surviving.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD, YES, BUT.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Who cares? I'm very irresponsible about the future. I don't bother
at all about tomorrow. If tomorrow the whole world simply
evaporates...</p><p>Q: YOU WON'T HAVE FINISHED YOUR ATOMIC BUNKER.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:... I will say goodbye. Good morning, America.</p><p>Q: THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD FINAL SENTENCE, BUT FINALLY WE HAVE TO
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME MATERIAL QUESTIONS. PROBABLY, AS YOU SAID,
IT'S A QUESTION YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE, BUT
CONCERNING YOUR ROLLS ROYCES.… WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE PREACHING SOME
KIND OF, WELL, AT LEAST NOT MATERIALISTIC IDEOLOGY, BUT YET YOU ARE
ENJOYING A LUXURY LIFE.…</p><p>A: Matter and spirit are not two different things. Existence is
materialist/spiritualist. It is together. There is no duality.</p><p>Q: BUT BEING MATERIALISTIC AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS IS WHAT OTHERS
HAVE DESCRIBED AS EXPLOITATION. WOULDN'T YOU APPROVE FOR THAT?</p><p>A: Not at all. I don't possess a single Rolls Royce. You are talking
about Rolls Royces; I don't possess</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHO OWNS THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My people possess them. Q: BUT YOU USE THEM.</p><p>A: They allow me for one hour. If they don't allow, I will stop. Q:
YOU GO EVERY DAY AND SAY, "MAY I PLEASE...?"</p><p>A: Every day for one hour I go for a ride, and my people allow me. I
am not against riches, and I am not against LUXURY, but I am not asking
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WE SEE OTHERS ARE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: You were talking about the watch. Yes.… Q: IS IT ORIGINAL
DIAMONDS, OR IS IT...?</p><p>A: Are you a jeweler?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT IMITATION? I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON JEWELRY, BUT IT LOOKS RATHER
GENUINE. IS IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not. To me, diamonds or stones are the same. Q: I SEE.</p><p>A: I enjoy. It is beautiful; and it has been made by my people. It is
not Piaget, but they have defeated Piaget. And these are all ordinary
stones.</p><p>Q: DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY COMPANIES, HOW MANY RAJNEESH ENTERPRISES
THERE ARE IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I don't know and I don't bother.</p><p>Q: BUT NEVERTHELESS, I MEAN, YOU ENJOY A KIND OF LUXURY. WOULD YOU
AGREE TO THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am a perfect showman.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AT LEAST EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN THEM, IF YOU WANT TO HIRE A ROLLS
ROYCE... I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.</p><p>A: Not one? My people have managed to have ninety.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IT'S VERY UNECONOMIC TO HAVE NINETY ROLLS ROYCES AND HAVING
THEM IN THE GARAGE AND USE ONE EVERY DAY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: We don't bother about economics, economy, future. They are going
to have 365.</p><p>Q: BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO LET YOUR PEOPLE ENJOY THE FRUITS OF
THEIR WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is up to them. My commune has hundreds of other cars,
hundreds of buses, four planes, they have everything. It is not that
only I am enjoying luxury</p><p>-- they have everything. It is simply out of respect they will not
use a Rolls Royce. And I am using it because I have tried all the cars
and just by coincidence only the Rolls Royce seat suits my backbone.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND A MERCEDES WOULDN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have tried it; it was not good enough. Not even other Rolls
Royces, which are far more costly. I had a Corniche; it didn't suit me.
That was the costliest Rolls Royce. Then I had a Commarque -- that was
the number two Rolls Royce in cost; it didn't suit me. Now I am on the
third grade, the Silver Spur.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU WOULD NOT, FOR INSTANCE, IN SPECIAL REGARD TO OUR GERMAN
READERS, RECOMMEND A MERCEDES FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE WITH BACKACHES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I have used it. I would not recommend it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I AM VERY MUCH IN DOUBT WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO PRINT IT,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BIG ADVERTISEMENTS IN Spiegel, YOU KNOW.</p><p>A: You have to print it!</p><p>Q: ALL RIGHT, WE PROMISE.</p><p>A:... Because I love Germans. I have among my sannyasins a large
number of Germans. And they are the most stable, intelligent, reliable,
responsible people in the commune.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY ALSO PROVIDE THE MOST MONEY INTO THE FUNDS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WERE THEY ALSO THE MOST FRUSTRATED ONES BEFORE THEY CAME
HERE?</p><p>A: That I don't know, what they were.</p><p>Q: WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BRIDGE TOWARDS CURRENT GERMAN
CIVILIZATION. YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT FRUSTRATION -- THAT'S WHAT
ANDRES ELTEN WROTE -- FRUSTRATION WITH CIVILIZATION DROVE THEM TO
YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There may be some truth about it, because as man becomes more
intelligent, more alert, he starts looking for any meaning in life; and
he does not find it, hence frustration. Then he starts looking for some
way.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO GERMANY IS FIRST IN INTELLIGENCE, BUT ONLY SECOND IN MAKING
CARS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. You have not yet been able to create a Rolls Royce. Q:
WE ARE TRYING HARD, YOU KNOW.</p><p>A: You can try hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU KNOW WHO DECIDES WHO COMES COMPARATIVELY CLOSE TO YOU, WHO
SURROUNDS YOU IN YOUR STUDY, IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE? OBVIOUSLY, NOT FIVE
THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE CAN BE AROUND.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Just in the morning, everybody listens to me, the whole
commune together. In the evening, my secretary, Sheela, comes if there
is any problem for which she needs guidance from me. In the day, Vivek,
another sannyasin, takes care of my food. She comes only when I give her
a call to bring my food or my tea. Otherwise, I remain completely
alone.</p><p>Q: DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHY THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE HAVE THE
PRIVILEGE OF SEEING YOU TONIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. That is the decision of Isabel. People who are editing, people
who are part of the publicity department, people who are in some way
concerned with our magazine, with our newspaper, with our newsletter;
these are the people Isabel has collected because they need to be
here.</p><p>Q: IN YOUR BIBLE YOU TOLD A VERY NICE AND VERY MOVING LITTLE STORY
ABOUT A BILLIONAIRE -- AN OLD MAN OF SIXTY-FOUR OR SO -- WHO TRIED TO
JOIN THE MOVEMENT OR TO JOIN THE COMMUNE, AND THEN HE HAD TO STRUGGLE
WITH HIS FAMILY, AND THIS SORT OF THING. THIS WAS IN DECEMBER, 1984. HAS
HE JOINED NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: This morning I told this story you are mentioning?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I CAN'T RECALL HIS NAME, BUT IT'S A LONG EPISODE IN The
Rajneesh</p><p>Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am such a materialist, the moment you said millionaire,
billionaire, then I immediately remembered it. He was here. He still
comes every month almost. His family is much disturbed, because he is
the head of the family and head of the businesses and corporations, and
they are naturally worried that if he becomes a sannyasin, he may start
donating to my Rolls Royce collection. But nobody is interested in
converting him to be a sannyasin. In fact, he was amazed that nobody had
even asked him to be a sannyasin.</p><p>For almost one year he has been coming here. His family is worried.
Here nobody is bothered, here nobody takes any interest in anybody's
personal life: why you are not a sannyasin, why you don't become a
sannyasin. If you have been coming for one year continuously and doing
all the groups and the therapies, you must be somehow thinking of
becoming a sannyasin. Even that is not asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JUST LET ME ASK ONE LAST QUESTION I ASKED SHEELA BEFORE:</p><p><br></p><p>A: You drop that Sheela completely.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, I'M NOT ASKING HER, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU THE SIMILAR THING
BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT.…</p><p>A: You just ask directly.</p><p>Q: YES. WHY IS IT YOU HAVE ONLY WOMEN IN YOUR INNER CIRCLE, IN YOUR
INNER POWER CIRCLE? ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE MORE INTELLIGENT, OR
THAT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MEN, AS SHEELA PUT IT? OR
IS THERE ANY OTHER REASON FOR IT?</p><p>A: There are many reasons. The woman is not more intelligent than
man. But because the woman has not been allowed to use her intelligence
for centuries...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SHE KEPT IT FRESH.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:... she has kept it fresh. That's why she looks superior and better
and more capable. Otherwise, there is no question. It is just a land
which has not been used, not been cultivated. She gives better crops,
and woman has always been symbolized by the earth. That's why the
husband -- the word HUSBAND simply means the cultivator.</p><p>Because women have suffered for centuries, I would like to
compensate. Man has done sheer inhumanity to women. They have been
treated worse than cattle. So in my commune, I have allowed them to
express and come up with their whole potential. One thing is certain,
that they are more loving.</p><p>Q: CLEVER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: More loving. And as far as religion is concerned, a loving person
has more possibility to grow than a man who is stuck in his head with
logic, ideas, philosophies. The woman is free. If she falls in love, she
is more courageous than any man. And to be with a Master is a kind of
love affair. For men, for women, it makes no difference. These people
love me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT NOT IN THE REAL SENSE OF THE WORD.</p><p>A: In the real sense of the word.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOT ONLY PHILOSOPHICALLY... I</p><p>A: Not in the unreal sense of the word to which you are
accustomed.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID ONCE THAT DEATH WOULD BE A NEW DOOR OPENING WITH THE
WHOLE LIFE CONDENSED, A NEW DIMENSION OPENING. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU
ATTACK VERY SHARPLY ANY CHRISTIAN OR ANY OTHER BELIEF OF LIFE AFTER
DEATH. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NEW DIMENSION OPENING AFTER
DEATH, AND LIFE AFTER DEATH?</p><p>A: The difference is that I am not saying that you have to believe in
it. I am saying it is my experience. I am not telling you either to
believe or disbelieve. I am simply telling you my experience and
continuously insisting side by side that you are not to believe in
anything. I remember my past lives, so I know absolutely that life goes
on and on. There is no end to life. It only changes the bodies.</p><p>Q: WHICH PAST LIVES DO YOU REMEMBER, AND WHICH ONES DO YOU LIKE BEST
NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The best is this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WHICH ONES DO YOU REMEMBER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I remember many: sometimes fragments, sometimes a few incidents,
sometimes the whole series. But it is pointless.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TELL US SOME.…</p><p>A: It will be meaningless.</p><p>Q: BUT WE ARE CURIOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not curious.</p><p>Q: IF IT'S MEANINGLESS, IT DOESN'T... THE SAME AS SO MANY OF YOUR
STATEMENTS.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, because those will be simply stories for you. What is the
point?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, IF NOTHING IS THE POINT OF ANYTHING -- WHICH IS THE WHOLE
POINT OF YOUR RELIGION -- YOU ARE COMPLETELY UNATTACKABLE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: ... completely unattackable -- because there is no point, no
principle, no dogma. I will attack everybody and nobody can attack me.
That is simply true.</p><p>(THE JOURNALISTS' TAPE RECORDER CLICKS OFF. )</p><p>Q: GOOD! NOW THAT WAS A COINCIDENCE.</p><p>A: This is a coincidence, right.</p><p>Q: NO MORE QUESTIONS, THANK YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT HAS BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU.</p><p>A: I enjoyed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE DIDN'T GET ENLIGHTENED, BUT WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED WITH OUR
INTERVIEW.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: One day you will get enlightened too. Q: HOPEFULLY.…</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-3>The Last Testament, Vol 1

PORTLAND. MY QUESTION IS THIS: CAN THE RAJNEESHEES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS
IN OREGON EVER COEXIST PEACEFULLY?</p><p>ANSWER: Never. Peter Gillins</p><p>UPI Wire Services, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, PETER GILLINS FROM THE UNITED PRESS. ON ABC'S MORNING
INTERVIEW PROGRAM THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT YOU CONSIDERED YOURSELF TO
BE THE GURU OF THE RICH AND YOU WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE OTHER RELIGIONS TO
TAKE CARE OF THE POOR. IN LIGHT OF THAT, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE AN
OBLIGATION TO PAY TAXES ON THE MONEY THAT YOUR FOLLOWERS GIVE YOU IN THE
FORM OF DONATIONS?</p><p>A: Nobody has given anything to me, and I don't accept anything from
anybody. Whatsoever I use is loaned to me just for the time being. I am
wearing this watch only for these two hours.</p><p>Q: SHOULD YOUR FOUNDATION BE REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES ON DONATIONS? DO
THE RICH NEED CHARITY -- WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS?</p><p>A: Those rich people are intelligent enough to pay their own taxes. I
don't have to take care of that. I myself have never paid any tax
because my work is concerned with outcome, not with income.</p><p>Mark Haas</p><p>KATU TV, Channel 2, Portland, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, LAST YEAR YOU BROUGHT THE POOR AND HOMELESS INTO YOUR
COMMUNE, PRESUMABLY TO HELP THEM AND IN LIGHT OF THAT MY QUESTION IS,
WHY DO YOU ACCEPT THE ROLLS ROYCES THAT YOU ACCEPT WHEN PERHAPS THAT
MONEY MAY BE USED TO HELP THE POOR AND HOMELESS THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP
LAST YEAR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have not accepted a single Rolls Royce. Those Rolls Royces are
owned by the sannyasins. And remember clearly that I am not a
Rajneeshee. You can see from my clothes. I am just a guest here, and if
my host feels to take care of me and enjoys it, who am I to interfere in
it?</p><p><br></p><p>Greg Hoy</p><p>7 Network Australia TV, Australia</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, THIS MORNING YOU EXPLAINED TO US THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOURSELF AND HISTORY'S SELF-PROFESSED PROPHETS AND MESSIAHS. YOU
EXPLAINED THAT YOU WERE NOT SPECIAL AT ALL AND THAT YOU DID NOT WISH TO
PLACE YOURSELF ON A HIGH PEDESTAL. DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THERE MAY
BE THOSE THAT SEE THE REGAL WAY YOU DRESS, AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO
FOLLOW YOU, SEE YOUR JEWELED, BORROWED WATCHES AND NOW -- FAMOUS
BORROWED ROLLS ROYCES AND THINK THAT YOU HAVE VERY SUCCESSFULLY PLACED
YOURSELF HIGH ON A PEDESTAL, AND IT'S AN ELEVATION YOU OBVIOUSLY
ENJOY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am certainly successful. I am going to be more successful... and
I highly enjoy my people, whatsoever they offer. But you must remember
these are not real diamonds, and this is the cheapest, most beautiful
watch in the whole world. This is made by my own sannyasins, artists,
craftsmen, jewelers. The same watch from Piaget is half a million
dollars. This watch, as far as dollars are concerned, is not more than
one hundred dollars. But if you want me to sell it to you -- I am not
going to sell it to you for ten million dollars.</p><p>This is a work of love, and love cannot be purchased.</p><p>Richard Draper KOIN TV, Channel 6,</p><p>Portland, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, TEN DAYS AGO IN THIS HALL, YOU TOLD A GROUP HERE</p><p>-- AND I QUOTE -- "WE HAVE TO DEPROGRAM AMERICA FROM DIRTY POLITICS,
FROM FANATIC RELIGIONS, FROM ALL KINDS OF HYPOCRISY."HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
TO DEPROGRAM AMERICA?</p><p>A: America is too small a thing for me. We are trying to deprogram
the whole world. I have my people around the world trying to deprogram
every country, every religion, from all the conditions that have been
forced upon them.</p><p>And remember one thing. Don't get confused when I use the word
deprogramming -- because there are psychologists who are trying to
deprogram people. They are not really doing deprogramming, they are
doing RE- programming. A Christian moves out of the fold, he is brought
back forcibly to the deprogrammer, who reprograms him back into
Christianity.</p><p>I am simply deprogramming and then leaving you alone to your own
consciousness, your awareness, and to do whatsoever your insight allows
you, your responsibility feels. It is you who have to be decisive about
yourself. Neither the Bible, nor Koran, nor Gita; neither Jesus, nor
Buddha, nor me -- nobody is going to dominate and manipulate you like a
puppet. A deprogrammed person is one who is no more a puppet, who has
declared his independence from the bogus God and his prophets, messiahs
and incarnations. We are already doing it. If you want to see how we are
doing it, come to these people, be with these people, live with these
people and you will understand it. There are things which can only be
experienced. Don't be afraid, because you will be deprogrammed; only
through deprogramming you will know what it is and how it is done. You
are welcome.</p><p>Jon Tuttle</p><p>KGW TV, Portland, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, AS WE UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE JUST TWO RAJNEESHEE COMMUNES
LEFT IN THE UNITED STATES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE HEAR REPORTS THAT BOTH
MEMBERSHIP AND DONATIONS ARE ON THE DECLINE. IT APPEARS THAT TO DATE
AMERICA HAS LOOKED AT RAJNEESHISM AND SAID, "NO THANK YOU." DID YOU COME
TO THE WRONG COUNTRY AT THE WRONG TIME?</p><p>A: Whenever I would have come, it would have been the wrong time. I
cannot come at the right time -- in spite of all the watches given to
me. I just either come before the time or come after the time.</p><p>But this is the fate of a person like me.</p><p>The message that I am giving will never fit with the existing
society. But I enjoy to be a misfit. That means I am still alive. Those
who have fitted completely, comfortably, are just small parts in a big
mechanism. I have belonged to no</p><p>society, to no country, to no religion. I will always be a misfit
even amongst Rajneeshees, because I am not a Rajneeshee. It is just
their love and their tolerance that they allow me to be here. Otherwise
I don't follow anything of Rajneeshism.</p><p>I can't follow anything. I simply live moment to moment. It is
perfectly true. I have come at the wrong time. But that is the way, the
ONLY way I can come. But we will try to change the time.</p><p>I am not going to fit with your dead and rotten society; I am going
to change it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE OTHER HALF OF MY QUESTION WAS WHETHER THIS WAS THE WRONG
COUNTRY. WAS IT A MISTAKE TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES?</p><p>A: All countries are wrong, because the very idea of country is
idiotic. This whole earth, this whole world, is one.</p><p><br></p><p>Don Lattin</p><p>San Francisco Examiner,</p><p>San Francisco, California, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ELABORATE ON TWO THINGS YOU SAID IN
POONA ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS BECOME INSTITUTIONS --
WHEN BUDDHA BECOMES BUDDHISM OR RAJNEESH BECOMES RAJNEESHISM. YOU WARNED
THAT ONCE A RELIGION BECOMES ORGANIZED, VIOLENCE ENTERS INTO IT.
ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO BE VIOLENT; IT HAS TO FIGHT ITS WAY. I WANTED
YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT, IN LIGHT OF THE WEAPONRY WE SEE AND THE SECURITY
FORCES IN RAJNEESHPURAM.</p><p>THE OTHER THING YOU SAID ON THAT SUBJECT WHICH I FOUND VERY
FASCINATING WAS "WE HAVE TO LEARN ONE THING, NOT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE
RELIGION. WHEN THE MASTER GOES, LET THE RELIGION GO." I WANTED YOU TO
COMMENT ON THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE HERE LAST
SUMMER THAT THREE COMMITTEES WERE BEING FORMED TO OVERSEE RAJNEESHISM
ONCE YOU -- IF YOU -- LEAVE YOUR BODY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Your question needs no answer, because the answer is all over the
place. Look at the guns around me; look at the organization of
Rajneeshism -- and I am still alive, I am not dead. But I am fighting
with everybody, not only the people who are not Rajneeshees. I am
fighting with every Rajneeshee too.</p><p>Don't get institutionalized. Don't become an organization; remain an
organism. Whatsoever I have said is absolutely true, and you can see the
organization and the guns as evidence of it. And when I am going to die,
who cares what happens? Please at least let me die peacefully.</p><p>Mr. Romano Giachetti EPOCA Magazine, Italy</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, BUT I AM ITALIAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is great. In America, everybody is a foreigner!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I HAVE BEEN IN THIS CITY EIGHT HOURS NOW, AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF
EMOTIONS, MOST OF THEM STRONG. BUT I WAS FOLLOWING YOUR LECTURE THIS
MORNING AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS THAT YOU SAY THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO
ITALY. MY... THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION!</p><p>A: Just ask it. Don't say it's serious. If you say it is serious you
have already destroyed its seriousness. Just say it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AMONG THE MANY THINGS THAT YOU SAID THAT IMPRESSED ME, THERE WERE
A FEW THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO A CULTURE THAT I THOUGHT I HAD LEFT IN
ITALY, NAMELY THAT GOD DOESN'T EXIST; THAT ANY RELIGION THAT IS
ORGANIZED MEANS EXPLOITATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AND MANY OTHER THINGS
THAT YOU SAID. IT CAME TO ME THAT THERE WAS ONE ITALIAN THINKER, ANTONIO
GRAMSCI, WHO HAS SAID MANY THINGS THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONE ABOUT GOD, THE ONE ABOUT RELIGION, AND ABOVE ALL THE
ONE ABOUT THE NEW KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE NEED IF WE WANT TO
CHANGE LIFE ON THE PLANET. HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMMUNIST
PARTY.</p><p>THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS, DO YOU SEE ANY POSSIBILITY FOR THE BIRTH
OF A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNISM, OF ALL THE SYSTEMS
THAT EXIST ON THE PLANET?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is every possibility -- not only possibility, but I would
say almost certainty of its happening.</p><p>Even in a communist country, consciousness cannot be prevented from
growing, from spreading; love cannot be prevented. In communist
countries they can nationalize your house, your money, your other
commodities, but they cannot nationalize your being. That is everywhere
just the same. It makes no difference. And to bring the consciousness to
its highest peak, any place is as good as any other place. The question
is basically the individual's decision.</p><p>I have sannyasins in the Soviet Union. Of course, they cannot come
into the open, they are underground sannyasins. They are being
persecuted, but persecution somehow always helps people to spread the
message and their number is</p><p>growing every day. My books are prohibited in the Soviet Union, but
my people are writing them with their own hands or making typescripts,
and they are moving hand to hand, from one person to another person.</p><p>In fact, in the basements of houses where my people meet in Soviet
Russia, they are more excited than anywhere else, because for the first
time certainly they are doing something that gives them their dignity
back.</p><p>Communism has nothing to do with God, heaven, hell. Communism is an
economic theory. In fact, this should not interfere with religion.
Religion is not their domain, but Karl Marx is their Holy Bible because
he said there is no God, there is no consciousness even. What
consciousness we have is only a by- product. The moment we die, the
consciousness is finished.</p><p>They have not explored within, they have not meditated; they have
simply believed in Karl Marx, in DAS KAPITAL. So I include communism
also in all the other rotten religions. That is a different kind of
Christianity, a different kind of Hinduism, a different kind of Buddhism
-- and they all are bent upon destroying the individual. All the
religions of the world, communism included, are bent upon destroying the
individual, his freedom.</p><p>I am trying my best, even in communist countries, and the message is
reaching. And the problem is not so big as it appears. Even if there are
only two hundred enlightened people in the whole world, the third world
war is not possible. So the work is not that big. We CAN manage it, we
WILL manage it, and I am absolutely certain about it.</p><p>Jeff McMullen</p><p>60 Minutes, Australia</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHO IS THE BETTER SHOWMAN, IN METAPHYSICAL TERMS IF YOU
LIKE, YOU OR PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nobody can beat me. I am the best showman in the whole history of
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF THAT IS TRUE, WHAT KIND OF SHOW DO YOU ENJOY? IS THIS THEATER,
OR CIRCUS?</p><p>A: This is my circus, my carnival. And I enjoy it immensely. Marilyn
Deutsch</p><p>Public Broadcasting System, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE SAID YOU
ARE THE RICH MAN'S GURU. I AM WONDERING, THOUGH. YOU KNOW OF SUFFERING
ON THIS EARTH AND STARVING PEOPLE IN AFRICA. DO YOU HURT WITH THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE</p><p>SUFFER SO AND DIE FROM STARVATION, OR HAVE TO SLEEP ON STREETS AND
THINGS LIKE THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I know, and I know also why they are suffering there. They are
suffering there because of your priests and your politicians. Still, all
the religions are against birth control methods. They want abortion to
be made illegal. Pope the Polack continuously says that these children
are sent from God, so we cannot prevent them.</p><p>I am not responsible for this poverty that you see on the earth. If
the world listens to me, this poverty can disappear immediately. But
they are listening to the wrong people, because they have become
accustomed to listening to them for centuries. The Hindu shankaracharya,
the Mohammedan caliph, the Christian pope, howsoever they may be
different in small, meaningless matters, are absolutely together in that
people should continue to produce more and more people. Then this world
is going to die, naturally.</p><p>My few Rolls Royces -- which are not mine, I just use them -- I can
give to Ethiopia. Do you think Ethiopia will be saved? If you are
certain, then take all the Rolls Royces from here, and give them to
Ethiopia. Ethiopia is created by the pope, and I have to sell my Rolls
Royces...? What kind of logic is this?</p><p>Why should I bother about the people who don't listen to me, if they
are starving? They are not even ready to understand me, to listen to me.
This I am saying from my own experience.</p><p>India... I have been there, for thirty years continuously moving
around the country, a wandering teacher. Nobody is ready to listen. They
are ready to throw stones at me, they are ready to throw shoes at me,
they are ready to throw knives at me, they are ready to make attempts on
my life, and when these people start dying I have to sell my Rolls
Royces? I am not going to do that.</p><p>Whether there is Ethiopia or not does not matter at all. What does it
matter? If India disappears, it will be unburdening the whole world,
bringing a little more richness. In fact this world needs one fourth of
its population, and the only way is for twenty years, absolute birth
control. And abortion should not only be legal, it should be
rewarded.</p><p>You should stop giving Nobel prizes to criminals like Mother Teresa,
who is increasing the world population by saving the orphans. You should
give your Nobel prizes to people who can bring this whole world to one
fourth of its population.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF? DO YOU THINK YOU DESERVE A NOBEL PRIZE?</p><p>A: I do not, because what will it do -- only two more Rolls
Royces...! Peter Coster</p><p>Australian Newspaper Service, Australia</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHY DO YOU THINK SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN ARE DRAWN TO YOU?</p><p>A: I am not a homosexual. I am heterosexual. I love women and they
love me. And what I am saying to them is absolutely appealing to them,
because I am speaking against all male chauvinists of the past. I stand
for absolute liberation of women from man's hold, even to the extent
that there should be no marriage, because marriage is a bondage, a
life-long bondage.</p><p>People should live naturally just as all animals live -- no marriage,
no divorce, no quarrels, no problems. Have you seen any henpecked camel?
And on the other hand, have you seen any man who is not a henpecked
husband?</p><p>You have repressed the woman, you have taken away everything from
her. They were not allowed to be educated, they were not allowed to be
economically independent, they were not allowed even to go out of the
house, they were not allowed even to show their faces to other human
beings. These people who have continuously killed the spirit of the
woman are the worst criminals we have known, but they are worshipped.
They are worshipped by men, because they have given men power over half
of humanity.</p><p>Here, everybody is absolutely free. If two persons feel like making
love, and they agree, then it is nobody else's business to prevent them.
Anybody preventing them -- any law, any court, any politician, any
priest -- is simply going beyond his limits.</p><p>My community is a community of love. And of course, as I have said, I
am the greatest showman in the world. Women are bound to be attracted to
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU TALK OF PHYSICAL LOVE WITHOUT
AMBITION AMONG SANNYASINS. ARE YOU CELIBATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Why should I be? I am just natural, why should I be unnatural?
If you want to meet celibates you go to a Catholic monastery, and you
will meet celibates doing nothing but masturbating.</p><p>I don't see that anybody can be naturally celibate. He is bound to
become a pervert, some way or other.</p><p>And I am a simple, natural man. I follow my natural instincts in
every way. I have loved many women -- perhaps no man may have loved so
many women. In the beginning I used to keep a count; then I dropped it,
because what is the point?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, ONE FINAL QUESTION. WHY DO YOU THINK OUTSIDE PEOPLE FEEL
THREATENED BY THIS COMMUNITY OR YOU?</p><p>A: I don't care at all. The outside does not exist. We are absolutely
contented and happy herenow. They should take care of themselves. We are
not hostile to them, we are simply unconcerned. They are hostile towards
us.</p><p>And remember one fundamental law of life. If they are hostile, they
have hate towards us, sooner or later they are going to fall into my
trap, because hate can turn into love very easily, just as love can
become hate very easily.</p><p>But my people have nothing to do with them. We are not hostile to
them, we are not against them, we never think about them.</p><p>For five years I have not seen a single newspaper. I don't read. I
don't see television. I don't know what is being said about me. I don't
care, because I have no desire to be a respectable great master, a
messiah, a prophet. I am just an ordinary man. And I am notorious enough
-- what is the point of reading it again and again?</p><p><br></p><p>Bruno Glaus</p><p>World Press Institute, Switzerland</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, MY QUESTION REFERS TO THE WORLDWIDE FAMINE CRISIS. DON'T
YOU THINK YOUR LECTURE THIS MORNING MAKES THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND THE
CURRENT GOVERNMENTS VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY THINK
ALSO. I QUOTE: "STARVATION IS A WAY OF NATURAL BALANCE" OR I QUOTE, IF I
QUOTE IT WELL: "HELPING THE POOR IS DESTROYING THEIR LICENSE TO HEAVEN."
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THEY SEE THE WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They must be quoting me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DON'T YOU THINK YOUR COMMUNITY STABILIZES, BY THIS KIND OF VIEW,
THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, my community is so much more intelligent that there is no need
for nature to balance it. In four years' time here, not a single baby
has been born. Four sannyasins have died. I am not going to overburden
the earth. It is simply a way of nature to establish harmony.</p><p>It is in fact absolutely true that service to the poor has been the
basic cause of poverty remaining for centuries. You go on throwing a few
crumbs off your table, and those poor people go on hoping for more, and
your priests go on telling them, "Just wait a little. After death you
are going to be in paradise." And in paradise, even a camel can pass
through the eye of a needle, but no rich man can enter the gates.</p><p>They console the poor to remain poor. They make him happy because the
rich man will suffer in hell. They make the rich man happy because their
consolation</p><p>of the poor prevents revolution. The happy rich man goes on
contributing to make big cathedrals, churches, because he knows that if
he can manage here, he will be able to manage there too -- if even a
camel can manage, do you think Rockefeller, Morgan or Ford will not be
able to manage? They are certainly far more intelligent than a
camel.</p><p>I am certainly against poverty, and I want to destroy it completely.
But to destroy it completely one thing has to be understood, that all
preventive measures should be taken.</p><p>People who are not giving birth to children should be rewarded.
People who are giving birth to children -- their income taxes should go
higher and higher. People are doing just the opposite. If you have more
children, you have less income tax. This is strange. The government
policy is family planning, and on the other hand if the family is bigger
you support the bigger family, you don't support the person who has no
family.</p><p>These priests and politicians are responsible for keeping poverty
somehow alive. They are still doing that. Send help to Ethiopia, send
help to India. It fulfills the ego of the super-rich countries, and it
also keeps those poor countries in a subtle, mental slavery, always
dependent on you.</p><p>If I am listened to, it is so simple a matter. We just need one world
government; we don't need any countries. We need one government, one
world, and that government, that world can easily see where the problem
is.</p><p>Even a poor country like India, where people are starving, is
exporting wheat to other countries. It seems we are living in a
madhouse! Indians are dying, starving, and they are exporting wheat. But
they have to export, because they want to make nuclear weapons. From
where are they going to get nuclear plants? They need money for
that.</p><p>Seventy-five percent of the national incomes of all the countries
goes to war, either fighting or preparing for fighting. If the world is
one, seventy-five percent of the income of the whole world is
immediately released. Poverty disappears like a dewdrop in the early
morning sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Mary Catherine The Rajneesh Times,</p><p>Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT POLITICS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Do I have to say?</p><p>I curse it. It is the calamity that has made us live for centuries in
suffering. Politics is absolutely unnecessary. But politicians will not
allow it to become unnecessary because then they lose their
presidencies, their White Houses, their Kremlins, their prime
ministerships.</p><p>Politics is not needed, it is really out of date. It was needed
because nations were continuously fighting. In three thousand years
there have been five thousand wars.</p><p>If we just dissolve the boundary lines -- which exist only on the map
not on the earth -- who will bother about politics? Yes, there will be a
world government but this government will be only functional. It won't
have any prestige to it, because there will be no competition with
anybody. If you are the president of the world government, so what? You
are not higher than anybody else.</p><p>A functional government means the way railways are run. Who cares who
is the president of the railways? The way the post office is managed and
managed perfectly, who cares who is the head postmaster general?</p><p>Nations have to disappear, and with the disappearance of nations
politics itself disappears. It commits suicide. What remains is a
functional organization that takes care. It can be made rotary like a
Rotary Club, so sometimes a black man is the head, sometimes a woman is
the head, sometimes a Chinese is the head, sometimes a Russian is the
head, sometimes an American is the head -- but it goes on moving like a
wheel.</p><p>Perhaps not more than six months should be given to one person, more
than that is dangerous. So for six months be president and then go down
the drain forever. And no person should be chosen again. This is simply
poverty of intelligence that you go on choosing the same person as
president again, again and again. Don't you see it as poverty of
intelligence? You don't have any intelligent people? You have just one
dodo to go on?</p><p>In one world there is no need for political parties, either.
Individuals should decide individually. There is no need for any
political party, it is very destructive of democracy. Although people
say that democracy cannot exist without political parties, I say to you
democracy cannot exist if political parties are there, because they have
their vested interests.</p><p>Each individual is free to run for any post or to vote for anybody he
feels right. And whoever comes out may be far wiser than your presidents
and prime ministers. Perhaps because he is going to be there for only
six months, he cannot waste his time inaugurating this university,
inaugurating that bridge, inaugurating this road, inaugurating all kinds
of nonsense and wasting time. And the parliament is simply arguing about
absolutely meaningless affairs as if they have eternity in their hands.
A small bill takes years to pass.</p><p>A man who has only six months cannot allow this stupidity. He will
choose scientific advisers, experts in different fields. For example, in
economics he will find all the best economic minds in the world to
advise him. He has not much time. He cannot go on with third-rate
politicians who know only the art of lying and nothing else. If he has
to decide about education, he will ask the advice of the great
educationists of the world. But right now strange things happen.…</p><p>In India, when I was there, in Morarji Desai's government a man
became the education minister of the central government. I know the man.
I have seen many</p><p>idiots, but he is only number two -- because number one is Morarji
Desai. He is the education minister. He is going to decide the whole
educational system of the country.</p><p>But he decides nothing. The bureaucracy goes on running in the same
way. They go on playing the small games of back-biting, of pulling legs,
of making every effort to reach to the top. Just a single formula I give
to you: one world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MANY POLITICIANS HAVE ASKED IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS PLACE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Never. Who wants to fall back in all that bullshit? It was so
difficult to get out of it. It took many lives for me to get out of it
all -- and you are asking me again to take a dive into the bullshit?
No. Absolutely no!</p><p>Emico Franceschini La Repubblica, Italy</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I AM ENRICO FRANCESCHINI FROM La Repubblica, AN ITALIAN
NEWSPAPER.</p><p>A: I love Italians... except their spaghetti.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF I MAY FIRST FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION CONCERNING COMMUNISM THAT
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE ASKED YOU BEFORE. YOU SAID THIS MORNING THAT
MESSIAHS, PROPHETS, INCARNATIONS OF GOD ARE CHEATING US, KEEPING US
REPRESSED AND PREVENTING US FROM REBELLING AGAINST THE STATUS QUO. YOU
SAID THAT POVERTY AND HUNGER ARE NOT A BLESSING. BUT COMMUNISTS HAVE
SAID THESE SAME THINGS FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING TO
ELIMINATE POVERTY AND HUNGER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, they have tried to eliminate... not poverty, but richness.
And they have eliminated it. Now the whole of communist Russia is
equally poor. That gives a certain satisfaction, of course, but it is
not my goal. I want to destroy poverty.</p><p>I am all for the rich man. I am the rich man's guru.</p><p>Q: LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION. IF, AS YOU SAID THIS MORNING, YOU
ARE JUST AN ORDINARY MAN, WHY IS THERE A BUDDHAFIELD AROUND YOU THAT
MAKES THE GRASS GREENER, AND PUTS MORE BIRDS IN THIS VALLEY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It always does around an ordinary man. To be ordinary is the most
extraordinary thing in the world. You can go around the world and you
will</p><p>never find an ordinary man. Everybody is exceptional, everybody is
special, everybody is imagining himself something big.</p><p>I am just an ordinary man, that's why a Buddhafield exists around me.
You become an ordinary man, and see.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JUST A VERY BRIEF QUESTION: SINCE TO LAUGH IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU
AND TO THIS COMMUNITY, IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE ARTS, LIKE MOVIES,
LITERATURE, THAT MAKES YOU LAUGH? DO YOU LIKE WOODY ALLEN?</p><p>A: I am so happy that I am continuously laughing with my sannyasins
-- and there is no reason why. Sometimes even I am surprised why they
are laughing, but I join them in their laughter.</p><p>To me, life is not rational, it is very irrational. I enjoy
everything -- except spaghetti.</p><p><br></p><p>Tarcisius Munaku</p><p>World Press Institute, Kenya</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, ONE CORRECTION. I AM FROM ZIMBABWE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's okay. From wherever you are, I am glad to see a black man.
To me black is beautiful, and I am all for the black people, although
they have not started coming to me; perhaps they are so poor, so
downtrodden, that they are involved in their own misery.</p><p>But take my message to them, that I would like as many black people
as possible here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE LACK OF FOLLOWERS WITH BLACK SKIN IN THIS
COMMUNITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The world has been divided into the East and the West. Now it
should be divided between the North and the South. The South has been
completely denied, ignored. It has not been able to grow in
intelligence. It has the same potential as the white people of the
North. Perhaps the black man has more potential than the white man.</p><p>One thing is certain, that black people's intelligence has not been
used for centuries, perhaps never. So it is absolutely raw, unused,
ready to burst forth. They are not coming to me for the simple reason
that my teaching is difficult for them to understand. The poor people
may turn Catholic, may turn communist, but they cannot become
Rajneeshees, because the poor people have hopes with the Catholics --
yes, after life, after death -- they have hopes with the communists</p><p>in this life. Of course it is a big bargain, but they are certainly
impressed by those things.</p><p>What I am saying just goes above their heads for a simple reason: you
cannot ask everybody why they do not understand Mozart's music -- but
what can Mozart do about it? You have to learn classical music, its
delicacies -- only then you can understand Mozart. I am speaking in
favor of luxury, richness in all dimensions of life. Naturally the poor,
wherever they are, will not feel in tune with me. But in fact, I am the
only person they SHOULD feel in tune with. I can drag them out of their
poverty.</p><p>Just look at my communes around the world. We have hundreds of
communes around the world, and they are all living richly, joyously. We
would like the same for you and for your country and for your people.
But it is a very strange phenomenon: you tend to listen to those same
people who are the cause of your poverty, your degradation, your
slavery.</p><p>In India I have experienced it. I was talking to people to make them
free of all mental bondage, all spiritual slavery, but they were turning
against me, because they think their spiritual slavery is not slavery,
it is something holy, a divine heritage.</p><p>It is very difficult. I can very easily reach people who have known
the taste of richness and have found frustration in it, those who are
educated and have found that all this education is worthless. It does
not give you wisdom to live; it gives you only knowledgeability that can
allow you somehow to vegetate.</p><p>The gap is big, even in India. Here you will see all white people. In
India it was the same. All white people, ten thousand sannyasins from
all over the world, were living with me -- but the Hindus were trying to
kill me. They made attempts to kill me. Before ten thousand white people
a Hindu stood up and threw a knife at me. That is their response. I can
understand it, because I am speaking against their tradition, and they
are so burdened with tradition they cannot imagine themselves free.
(SOUND OF DOORS BANGING) Has some black man reached there?</p><p><br></p><p>SHEELA: TODAY ONE OF THE PRESS PERSONS IS REPORTED TO HAVE COME WITH
A GUN TO SEE IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAD A BETTER SHOW THAN HE DID, THEN HE WAS
GOING TO SHOOT YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's great. Shoot me before all these media people. I would not
like to die in a dark dismal room lying on a bed. Shoot me! This is the
right moment. I have done everything that I wanted to do, I have
experienced everything that is possible to human consciousness. There is
nothing to lose. Shoot me this moment. Gather courage, don't be afraid.
I will tell my guards not to prevent you. My guards are not to shoot the
person. Assassinate me, because Jesus missed the media... at least don't
let me miss the media.</p><p>Q: I WAS GOING TO ASK WHY -- YOU SAY IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE YOU
LAST READ NEWSPAPERS, LAST SAW THE TELEVISION HOW COME YOU KNOW ABOUT
ETHIOPIA IF NOT FROM THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE T V?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Ask the Ethiopians. Go there. What have I to do with it and how
can I answer it? Go to Ethiopia and ask those people why they have not
come. That is their business, not mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, HOW COME YOU KNOW THERE IS HUNGER AND STARVATION IN ETHIOPIA
WHEN YOU DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPERS, WHEN YOU DON'T WATCH TELEVISION?
WHERE DO YOU GET THE INFORMATION?</p><p>A: Just from your questions -- that's enough for me. I answer your
questions, that's enough. I don't want to go into details. I have a
vision of my own, a clarity. I am just like a mirror; you come before it
and the mirror will reflect you. The mirror is not a photograph; the
moment you are gone, the mirror is again empty. I am just an empty
mirror; you ask the question -- I will respond with my totality. But my
response is pure, it is not the response of a scholar. It is not out of
knowledgeability, information, it is simply the clear insight of an
ordinary man.</p><p>John Ng'anga Thuruo</p><p>World Press Institute, Zimbabwe</p><p><br></p><p>A: Great. I was thinking there is only one. Two is too many!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU DESCRIBED PROPHETS, JESUS AND OTHER MESSIAHS AS
LIARS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WHAT YOU TEACH IS THE TRUTH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not teaching anything, so there is no question about my
teachings; nobody can ask whether they are true or not. I am teaching
only methods. I don't give you any dogma, any philosophy that you can
discuss and argue and find out whether it is true or not. I give you
only a method. Practice the method, and you will experience what I am
saying. Your experience will prove that what I am saying is truth.</p><p>These people here are here because they have experienced something.
They have left their countries, their families, they have left
everything they had, just to come to me.</p><p>And LOOK at me. This is stupid; when you are asking a question,
looking here and there is simply stupid. Just look at me. And listen to
what I am saying, because when you are moving this way and that, you are
not listening. Perhaps you are thinking that it is nothing.</p><p>Q: I AM LISTENING.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Then you must have understood what I have said -- I have no
teachings, I have only methodologies. I am a scientific person; science
has only experiments. I have only experiments.</p><p>Those who are courageous enough go through the experiments, and if
they find something there, it becomes THEIR truth. It is not my truth. I
don't emphasize to believe in me; even the method has to be accepted
only as hypothetical.</p><p>This is very pleasant for me because I don't have any principles.
Nobody can contradict me, nobody can criticize me, nobody can say that
what I am saying is not true. To say that he will first have to go
through the experiments, the meditation, the silence, the joy, the
blessing, and he will know. And I have never come across a single person
who has followed the path and has not reached. Existence is very
compassionate.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, ANOTHER QUESTION. THE FOLLOWERS, YOU CALL THEM
SANNYASINS, LOVE YOU SO MUCH -- I HAVE SEEN THAT AND YOU MUST BE AWARE
ABOUT A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS THAT LIVED IN JONESTOWN, GUYANA, WHO
COMMITTED SUICIDE SOME YEARS BACK. DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU EVER TOLD
THEM TO TAKE A POTION, THEY WOULD DO SO?</p><p>A: They love me, I love them; how can I help them commit suicide?
Reverend Jim Jones was a Christian. And the whole responsibility of
Jonestown's suicidal act is the responsibility of Christians from Jesus
to Pope the Polack. All Christians are responsible for it because they
have been teaching that all that is beautiful is beyond death. Jesus was
doing the same as Reverend Jim Jones, they belong to the same category.
Jim Jones was only repeating Jesus. Jesus was saying, "You are all going
to be with me, and soon I will come back and take all of you into the
glory of God." Two thousand years have passed. The guy has not been seen
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Nevil Aschen</p><p>National Public Radio, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, IS IT PLANNED THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE RAJNEESH
FOUNDATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL FEMALE? IS THERE A REASON FOR
THAT? IS IT SOMETHING DELIBERATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, there is a reason. I love women, and I want to give them all
that has been taken away from them through the whole history of man.
This is just a little compensation. All the women are running this whole
circus of mine, and they are doing it beautifully. And there are other
reasons also.</p><p>A man is more head-oriented. He thinks for and against. It is really
very difficult for a man to say a total yes or a total no. He is a split
personality. Some part of him says yes, some part of him says no.</p><p>The woman functions through her heart, which knows no division. If it
says yes it is total, and yes is beautiful only when it is total. If it
says no it is beautiful. Anything which is total has a beauty. Anything
which is half and half, fifty-fifty, is schizophrenic.</p><p>So not only the women who are in a biologically feminine body are
running the show, but also the men who are there have become more
feminine than they would have imagined ever. They have become more
graceful, more loving. Their heads are not more in the way, they have
fallen deep into their hearts.</p><p>In fact, all my sannyasins are women!</p><p>Howard Sattler</p><p>6PR Radio, Australia</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I HOPE I WON'T REPEAT MYSELF YOU HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY
TELLING US THAT YOU HAVE THE GREATEST CIRCUS IN THE WORLD AND AS WE KNOW
GREAT CIRCUSES TRAVEL. I WONDER IF YOU WOULD RESPOND TO STORIES FROM THE
SOUTHWEST OF AUSTRALIA THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO TOUR THE CIRCUS THERE AND
THAT THE CIRCUS IS GOING TO SET UP ITS BIG TOP THERE NEAR A LITTLE
TIMBER TOWN CALLED PEMBERTON.</p><p>A: Spread the rumor that I'm coming!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I WONDER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE PEOPLE THERE, PARTICULARLY
THE CHRISTIAN LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEADING A LEGAL AND A MORAL BATTLE
AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE OVER THERE, WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT IF THE CIRCUS COMES
TO TOWN AND WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE FOR THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are going to be shocked by my message. Make it clear to them
that my coming to Australia is going to create an immense turmoil in the
whole continent, because I don't believe in their morality -- it is all
hypocrisy. I don't believe in their values, which are only a mask, and
I'm going to hammer on that mask as hard as I can.</p><p>My whole work is to reveal your original face to you. Naturally, if
you hammer on somebody's mask he freaks out, because he has been
thinking that that mask is his face. So the first response to me is
always that of a shock. But if he has some guts -- which I think
Australians have -- if they have some guts, they will wait to see what
is behind the mask. Let the mask slip and you will be surprised:
your</p><p>personality was just mumbo-jumbo. This is your individuality, your
true being, and it brings freedom with it. It brings wisdom with it. It
brings a new kind of morality with it.</p><p>So just tell them to get ready!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE'RE READY. THANK YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Tom Senior</p><p>KPTV, Portland, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, GETTING BACK TO YOUR WRISTWATCH FOR A SECOND. AS AN
ENLIGHTENED MASTER, WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT TIME IT IS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just for your sake. I know the heat; my people are suffering in
the heat and you must be suffering too. I can continue forever. I am
sitting in an airconditioned place, you are not. It is just a little bit
of concern for my people and for you all who come from all over the
world. I don't want you to be ascetics. I want you to enjoy
Rajneeshpuram, not to suffer the heat here. Otherwise there is no
problem... I can stop looking at the watch. You seem to feel offended by
it. If that is so then it is great, because to offend is my whole
work.</p><p><br></p><p>Carlo Silvestro</p><p>Grazia Magazine, Italy</p><p>Q: YES, ANOTHER ITALIAN. BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SPEAK ON WHAT
KIND OF LOVE IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, AND ALSO IF THERE IS
ANY HOPE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHICH IS NOT GOING
TO BE ENTANGLED IN THE USUAL PATTERN OF SADO-MASOCHISM.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is a very significant question. Ordinarily, religions have made
it impossible. Any beautiful relationship between man and woman -- they
have destroyed it. There was reason to destroy it.</p><p>If a man's love life is fulfilled, you will not find so many people
in churches praying. They will be making love, early morning love, on
Sundays. Who bothers about the idiot who is preaching in the church? If
people's love lives are of immense content and beauty they won't bother
about whether God exists or not, whether the philosophy preached in the
Bible is true or not. They are so contented with themselves.</p><p>Once in a while it happens that I pass on the road and two lovers are
hugging each other. They don't even look at me. I feel so happy; they
must be in an immensely groovy place.</p><p>Religions have destroyed your love by creating marriage. Marriage is
the end, not the beginning. Love is finished. Now you are a husband,
your beloved is a</p><p>wife. Now you start trying to dominate each other. It is politics, no
more love. Now every small thing becomes a point to be argued.</p><p>And marriage is against human nature, so sooner or later you are
going to be fed up with the woman, and the woman is going to be fed up
with you. And it is natural, there is nothing wrong in it. That is why I
say marriages should not be there, because marriages make the whole
world immoral. A man sleeping with a woman, and they are not loving each
other but still are trying to make love because they are married -- this
is ugly, disgusting. This I call real prostitution.</p><p>When a man goes to a prostitute, at least it is straightforward. He
purchases a certain commodity. He does not purchase the woman, he
purchases a certain commodity. But he has purchased the whole woman in
marriage -- and for her whole life. All husbands and all wives without
exception are caged, trying to get free of it. But even sometimes in
countries where divorce is allowed and they manage to change the
partner, within a few days they are in for a surprise. The other woman
or the other man proves an exact copy of the one they have left
behind.</p><p>I remember hearing about one man who married eight times -- of
course, it must have been in California. When he married the eighth
time, after two days he recognized that he had married this woman once
before too. And then he started thinking, "What have I gained by
changing women? It all comes back to the same rut."</p><p>Stability in marriage is unnatural. Monogamy is unnatural. Man is by
nature a polygamous animal, and anybody who is intelligent will be
polygamous. You can't go on and on eating Italian food. Once in a while
you want to visit the Chinese restaurant!</p><p>I want people to be completely freed from marriage and marriage
licenses. The only cause of their being together should be love, not
law. Love should be the only law.</p><p>Then what you are asking is possible. The moment love disappears, say
goodbye to each other. There is nothing to fight for; love was a gift of
existence. It came like the wind, it has gone like the wind. You will be
grateful to each other. You may part, but you will remember those
beautiful moments you had been together. You may remain friends, if not
lovers. Ordinarily lovers when they part become enemies. In fact, they
become enemies before they part -- that's why they part.</p><p>Ultimately, if both persons are meditators, not just lovers, trying
to transform the very energy of love into a meditative state.… And that
is my whole approach towards man and his relationship with woman. It is
a tremendous energy. It is life. If, while making love to your woman,
you can both move into a silent period, utterly quiet, no thought
passing through your minds-as if time has stopped -- then you will know
for the first time the real taste of love. That kind of relationship can
remain for the whole life, because it is no more just biological</p><p>attraction which fades away sooner or later. Now you have a new
dimension opening.</p><p>Your woman has become your temple. Your man has become your temple.
Your love has become your meditation, and this meditation goes on
growing, and when it is growing you start becoming more and more joyful,
more and more nourished, more and more strengthened. There is no
relationship, there is no bondage to remain with the woman. But who can
renounce joy? Who can ask for divorce when there is so much joy? People
are asking for divorce because there is no joy, just despair and
twenty-four hours a day nightmare.…</p><p>My people here and around the world are learning that love is only
the jumping board. There is much more ahead of it, which is possible
only if two persons remain intimate for a longer period of time. With a
new person, again you begin from scratch. And there is no need for a new
person, because now it is not the biological or the physical aspect of
the person, but you have come into communion spiritually.</p><p>To transform sex into spirituality is my basic approach. And if both
are lovers AND meditators, they will not mind, once in a while, if you
visit a Chinese restaurant, or she goes to visit some continental
restaurant! It is not a problem. You love the woman; if she is feeling
happy once in a while with somebody else, what is wrong in it? You
should be happy that she is happy, because you love her. Only meditators
are capable of dropping jealousies.</p><p>Be a lover -- that is a good beginning, but not the end. Go on trying
to be more meditative. And be quick, because your love may be finished
the day the honeymoon is finished.</p><p>So meditation and love should go hand in hand. If we can create a
world where lovers are meditators too, then there will be no problem of
continuous torture, nagging, jealousies, hurting each other in every
possible way.</p><p>Love without meditation is bound to turn into hatred any moment --
beware -- but love with meditation will become deeper and deeper, more
and more intense. And perhaps two persons will feel together so attuned,
a kind of at-one- ment, that they would love to be together forever.</p><p>But that is not a condition. Any day, even if one partner decides,
"Now I am moving from this crossroad, away from you. Thank you for all
you have done. I remember all these beautiful moments, but I cannot
continue" -- that's enough. No court is needed to decide for you that
you are married, to decide for you that you are divorced. What an insane
world we are living in! Even our love is not free.</p><p>And when I say that love should be our freedom, they condemn me all
over the world as the "free-sex guru." Certainly I am all for freedom of
love. And in a way they are right: I don't want sex to be a commodity in
the market. It has to be freely available just two persons agreeing,
that's enough. And this agreement is only for the moment; no promises
for the future, because they become chains around your neck. They will
kill you. No promises for the future, just relish this</p><p>moment. And if next moment you are still together, you will be able
to relish it more.</p><p>So I don't use the word RELATIONSHIP. I use the word RELATEDNESS. You
can relate, but don't create relationship. If your relating becomes a
lifelong process, good. If it does not, that is even better. Perhaps
this was not the right partner, and it is good that you separated. Find
another partner. There must be someone somewhere who will be waiting for
you. But this society does not allow you to find out who it is who is
waiting for you, who is the person who will fit with you.</p><p>They will call me immoral.… To me, this is morality. What they are
trying to practice is immoral.</p><p>Burt Rudman KOMO Television,</p><p>Seattle, Washington, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WE'RE HERE TO DO A STORY ON YOUR PERSONAL SECRETARY,
SHEELA, AND I WAS HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE YOUR
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HER, AND PERHAPS WHY IT WAS WITH SHEELA WITH
WHOM YOU SPOKE DURING YOUR VOW OF PUBLIC SILENCE.</p><p>A: You can just see Sheela: she is so beautiful. Do you think
anything more is needed?</p><p>I have chosen her as my secretary because she has lived with me for
many years, and I have seen not only her physical beauty, but also her
spiritual beauty. I have seen her intelligence. I have seen that she can
manage this whole commune of crazy people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SHE WAS DISCUSSING WITH A GERMAN MAGAZINE RECENTLY THE FACT THAT
THE REASON THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE RAJNEESH TRUST WERE WOMEN WAS
THAT BECAUSE WOMEN ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MEN. AND I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU SHARED THAT FEELING WITH HER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's true. Even if a man wants to function more intelligently,
he will have to acquire some feminine qualities. As a man, he is just a
barbarian.</p><p>To acquire some feminine qualities.… And just see, all qualities are
feminine: love, compassion, sympathy, service, sharing -- all qualities
are feminine. Even if a man wants to function at the highest peak of his
intelligence, he will have to be guided by his heart.</p><p>And we are suffering so much because we have ignored the heart, we
have completely bypassed the heart. Our whole educational program is how
to bypass the heart -- the feeling part, the emotions, the sentiments,
the smiles, the tears --</p><p>and just go directly to the head. And the head is the most
insensitive place in the whole existence.</p><p>Inside the skull there is no sensitivity at all. Even if a bullet is
put inside your skull or my skull, under anesthesia, and I wake up, I
will not feel that there is anything inside the skull. The skull is
completely insulated in a way -- it is insensitive. That's why all of
science has gone in an insensitive way and has become a curse rather
than a blessing.</p><p>The heart has to be the master, and the head has to be the servant.
Just because physiologically the heart is lower and the head is higher,
it does not mean that the head is superior. The superior part of your
being is your heart. The delicate, the nice part, the most beautiful
part, is your heart. So whenever you start moving towards the heart, the
heart guides the head. Then whatever you do, you do with
sensitivity.</p><p>That's why I said all my sannyasins are women in essence. They have
accepted the heart as the master and the head as the servant. As a
servant, the head is perfectly good. As a master, it is absolutely
wrong.</p><p>Swami Ramateertha</p><p>The Rajneesh Times, Germany</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I WAS VERY SHOCKED AT HEARING YOU SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION
OF TEST-TUBE BABIES, SAYING THEY COULD BE GENIUSES, MORE BEAUTIFUL AND
HEALTHIER THAN HUMAN BEINGS. SURELY THE BEAUTY OF OUR INNER BEING IS ALL
THAT MATTERS? -- OR WERE YOU JOKING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Very rarely I am serious, and at the time I made that
statement I was very serious. I mean it -- because the man that has been
created by blind nature, blind biology, has not proved a real growth for
humanity. You can see it.</p><p>Charles Darwin says that monkeys became man. But, since that time --
that must have happened a million years ago -- for these one million
years man has not created anything better. Monkeys were far more
intelligent; at least they gave birth to humanity. Human beings seem to
be absolutely impotent. They go on creating carbon copies of themselves.
This has to be stopped.</p><p>I have heard... it happened in an office. The orders from above came
that the office is too cluttered with old files -- thirty years, fifty
years old -- they should be destroyed. But make sure that every file's
carbon copy is kept. But what is the</p><p>point? Why destroy the originals?</p><p>Man has been meeting with woman accidentally up to now. Hence, you
feel shocked -- anybody will feel shocked, I can understand -- to think
that a baby should not have the mother's womb, the warmth of the mother,
the care of the mother, the love of the mother. But, you know, there are
many other things also</p><p>in the mother: her nagging, her hatred, her jealousy, her stupidity.
He will get all those things too.</p><p>And we can see, the specimens are available all over the world. This
is what has come out of your relationship: Adolf Hitler is born out of
your human relationship, he was in a mother's womb. Joseph Stalin is
born in the same way. And all these criminals -- Alexander the Great,
Napoleon Bonaparte, Mussolini, Mao Tse-tung, Nadirshah, Tamerlane,
Genghis Khan -- history is full of these monsters. They have also come
out of loving women.</p><p>I don't trust any more in blind biology. I trust more in a conscious
human being. It is better to give the birth of the child to a test tube,
where we can choose the best semen, the best egg from the woman. And
there is no need to be worried because they are anonymous; in fact,
every hospital should have a bank. They have banks for blood; they
should have banks for semen and eggs, and they should look into the best
semen cell and the best egg meeting in a very clinical way -- in a test
tube. They will not have the heritage of your ugly past. They will be
fresh beings and we can program those eggs and the semen cells so that
more health, more life, more intelligence becomes possible.</p><p>In each love affair the man releases millions of living cells. Only
one of them will reach the female egg; he will become Ronald Reagan.
They all rush -- it is really a great rush.… Millions of living beings,
although they are very small and you cannot see them with your eyes --
and it is a big race, bigger than any race that happens on the
earth.</p><p>Thinking of their size, the track between the semen and the woman's
egg proportionately is two miles long. If they were your size, the track
would be two miles long. A two-mile track... and they are fighting hard
to survive, because there is not much time. They are always close to the
third world war. They can live only two hours, not more than that. And
only one cell reaches the egg and the egg closes. It rarely happens that
two cells reach simultaneously, that's why twins are born.</p><p>Rabindranath Tagore, one of the great poets of India, was the
thirteenth child of his father. The other twelve proved just idiots,
nobody knows their names even. Now, it is a long blind passage. If
Rabindranath's father had stopped after the twelfth child -- which seems
to be a good point to stop; one dozen is enough, more than enough --
then you would have missed one of the most beautiful beings on the
earth: a great poet, a great painter and a great human being... in every
way beautiful.</p><p>But in a test tube it is so easy. Those twelve should have been
discarded. We have chosen Rabindranath to be the first child -- and who
knows how much more potential would have been in him if he had gotten
the best female egg. Nobody knows.</p><p>We don't know the potentiality of humanity. Give it a chance. What I
am saying is, give it a chance. It looks in the beginning inhuman.
Everything new looks inhuman in the beginning.</p><p>Do you know, when the first railway train moved from London to a
nearby station, just eight miles' journey, nobody was ready to sit in
it... even for free. Lunch was served, free, but nobody was ready to
enter the train because the priest in the early morning said in church
that God never created any railway train; this is unnatural, this is
dangerous, this is inhuman. Don't sit in it.</p><p>What do you think would have happened if people had stopped? There
would have been no trains, no cars, no airplanes, no rockets to reach to
the moon, and we have to reach to the stars. We need more stronger
bodies, we need more intelligent people, and we need people who are
clean of all old crap. That is possible only if we make a clinical,
medical arrangement for the birth of man. I am absolutely in support of
it.</p><p>Bob Chase</p><p>KEX Radio, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY RAJNEESHEE
LEADERS THAT THE REASON FOR THE VOW OF PUBLIC SILENCE WAS BECAUSE YOU
HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY, THAT YOU HAD SAID IT ALL IN YOUR TEACHINGS AND
WRITINGS. IS YOUR FEELING NOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NEW TO SAY, THAT
THE PAST BEARS REPEATING, OR IS IT THAT YOU ENJOY THE SHOWMANSHIP IN THE
SETTING THAT YOU HAVE HERE TODAY, FOR BREAKING THE PUBLIC SILENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Your question implies so many things.</p><p>First, my silence was not because I have said everything. My silence
was because I wanted to drop those people who were hanging around my
words. I wanted people who can be with me even if I am silent. I sorted
out all those people without any trouble. They simply dropped out. Three
years was enough time. And when I saw all those people -- and they were
not many, but they were hanging around my words. I don't want people to
just believe in my words; I want people to live my silence. In these
three years it was a great time to be silent with my people, and to see
their courage and their love in remaining with a man who perhaps may
never speak again.</p><p>When the work was done, when those people had left, there was no need
to remain silent. I am back again, and I have much more to say -- and I
will always have much more to say. Even on my deathbed, or in the chair
being assassinated, I will still be saying something. I will not die
silently.</p><p>And I enjoy talking to my people. I enjoy their response. And, of
course, I am a showman. Everybody is, they just don't have the guts to
say it.</p><p>Ma Prem Isabel</p><p>Press Relations Bureau, Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, I'M NOT A JOURNALIST, BUT I DEAL WITH JOURNALISTS
ALL THE TIME. AND BEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS OVER, I HAVE A QUESTION
THAT EVERYBODY ASKS ME BUT NOBODY ASKED YOU TODAY. AND THAT IS, DURING
THE TIME YOU DIDN'T SPEAK, SHEELA WAS SPEAKING ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND
MANY PEOPLE GOT OFFENDED WITH HER COMMENTS. AND EVERYBODY ASKS, "HOW
COME SHEELA IS YOUR SPOKESPERSON? HOW COME SHEELA MAKES THOSE
STATEMENTS? SHE IS ANTAGONIZING PEOPLE."</p><p>WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?</p><p>A: I was also very much offended by Sheela.</p><p>Whenever she came back, I hit her hard, because she was not the way I
would like her to be-really outrageous! She was falling below the
standard. And I was continuously telling her, "Don't be worried, we
don't have anything to lose. We have the whole world to gain and nothing
to lose. Be outrageous!" There is a saying that "No news is good news."
It is only half, the other half I have to make. If no news is good news,
then good news is no news! It has to be sensational. I have been
sharpening her like a sword. "Go, and cut as many heads as you Isabel, I
agree. I was also offended.</p><p><br></p><p>Kathleen Stone</p><p>KBND Radio, Bend, Oregon, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE OUTSIDE, NO
INTEREST IN POLITICS. WHY THEN DID YOU TAKE OVER THE TOWN OF ANTELOPE,
OR YOUR FOLLOWERS, YOUR COMMUNITY? AND WHY THEN DID YOU SAY YOU WOULD
LIKE YOUR FOLLOWERS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD?</p><p>SHEELA: BHAGWAN, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CORRECTION. IT'S THE TOWN
OF.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. No need.</p><p>Q: I'M SORRY. THE CITY OF RAJNEESH, THE FORMER TOWN OF ANTELOPE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not a Rajneeshee, first, you have to remember. Q: I
UNDERSTAND THAT.</p><p>A: And I have not taken over the dead city of Antelope. Q: BUT YOUR
FOLLOWERS HAVE.</p><p>A: They are not my followers either. They are my fellow
travelers.</p><p>Now, I have such a big caravan. If a few people decide to make a dead
city alive, why should I interfere? They should try to find other dead
cities around and make them alive with laughter and joy. That's why I
said -- because the question was asked to me, "Are you going to take
Oregon?" -- I said, "No! It is too small a thing. I would like my people
to take over the whole world."</p><p>But that was simply a joke. And I love jokes.</p><p><br></p><p>Penny Allen</p><p>Esquire Magazine, USA</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, A NUMBER OF YOUR SANNYASINS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY SENSE
A CERTAIN RIPENESS IN THIS MOMENT. THEY FEEL THAT THE FRUIT OF
RAJNEESHISM IS RIPE NOW AND READY TO BE PLUCKED FROM THE TREE. DO YOU
FEEL THIS ALSO, AND IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS MOMENT TO ADDRESS
THE QUESTIONS OF THE PRESS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, they are right. And this is the right moment to declare to
the whole world that our tree has blossomed and the fruits are ripe, and
to invite them to come and share with us. It is true.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-4>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 13.]</p><p>Jeff McMullen 60 MINUTES, AUSTRALIA</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, OF THE MANY EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THAT YOU SAY, THE
ONE ON WHICH I WOULD NEVER DEBATE YOU IS THAT YOU ARE AN ORDINARY MAN.
HOW ORDINARY A MAN ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: Extraordinarily.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE YOU THE NEW MAN THAT YOU SAY THE WORLD NEEDS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU PUT YOURSELF ON A PLANE WITH OTHER GREAT MEN, JESUS,
BUDDHA, KRISHNA?</p><p>A: No. I am just myself and I don't belong to any past, past
prophets, messiahs. I am the beginning of a new man, absolutely
discontinuous with the past. I have nothing to do with Jesus, Moses,
Abraham, Krishna, Buddha. To me they are all dead and of no use for the
future new man. In fact they are the barriers for the new man to be
born. I am fighting against all those fellows.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE YOU A GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There is no God. God is the greatest fiction created by
cunning priests. The new man is not going to have any God. The new man
is enough unto himself No God is needed. God is needed by retarded
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WAS EINSTEIN RETARDED? HE BELIEVED IN A GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Then I will have to explain to you that Einstein was a great
physicist. He was a genius, but as far as other directions of life are
concerned, he was below average.</p><p>I am reminded: he was traveling in a bus. He gave some money for the
ticket, the conductor returned some change to him. He counted, and he
said to the conductor, "This is not right, you are cheating." The
conductor counted it again and he said, "Mister, it seems you don't know
how to count." And this is the greatest physicist of the world.</p><p>It is a strange phenomenon that the great scientists are very stupid
as far as religion is concerned. They are absolutely ignorant about it.
Even the ordinary man is more aware of the religions. The expert is
basically to be understood as a man who knows more and more about less
and less. The ultimate expert is one who knows all about nothing. The
religious man is not an expert. His situation is just the opposite. He
knows less and less about more and more, and ultimately he comes to a
point when he knows nothing about all. And that nothingness has been
called nirvana. It is not ignorance, it is innocence.</p><p>Q: LET ME TRY YOU ON SOME OTHER NOT SO ORDINARY MEN. IF I GIVE YOU A
NAME, PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR WORDS OF WISDOM FOR EACH OF
THESE PEOPLE: MAHATMA GANDHI.</p><p><br></p><p>A: He was the most cunning politician the world has ever known. Q:
ADOLF HITLER.</p><p>A: He was the most idiotic politician the world has ever known. Q:
POPE PAUL.</p><p>A: He should be behind bars. Q: MOTHER TERESA.</p><p>A: It is time for her to jump into a lake.</p><p>Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS LAUGH AND YET, WITH THAT KIND OF VERY UNSETTLING
RAW STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE, YOU CLEARLY DISTURB PEOPLE, WHO SEE THAT
SORT OF STATEMENT AS PROFANE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love to disturb people, because only by disturbing them can I
make them think. They have stopped thinking for centuries. Nobody has
been there to disturb them. People have been consoling them. I am not
going to console anybody, because the more you console them, the more
retarded they remain.</p><p>Disturb them, shock them, hit them hard, give them a challenge. That
challenge will bring their capacities to the climax.</p><p>Q: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HELLS ANGELS, A MOTORBIKE GANG -- LEATHER
JACKETS, HELMETS, A TERROR GANG -- HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE HELLS
ANGELS RODE INTO RAJNEESHPURAM AND DISTURBED YOUR TRANQUIL OASIS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will enjoy them. We will receive them as our guests. They
cannot disturb us. Nobody can disturb us. Even if they throw an atom
bomb on Rajneeshpuram, the atom bomb will have a shock, because we will
be celebrating, dancing, enjoying. Even death cannot disturb us. We will
celebrate it.</p><p>We do celebrate it. Whenever a sannyasin dies, even when my father
died, we danced, we celebrated. We enjoyed a beautiful departure, a
goodbye.</p><p>So there is no question: anybody can come, he will have an
appropriate welcome.</p><p>Q: THEN, BHAGWAN, WHY THE ARMED GUARDS AND THE PERIMETER AROUND YOUR
EXISTENCE HERE? SURELY NOT ANYBODY CAN COME?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Those guards are the responsibility of the Rajneeshees, I am not
concerned. I don't interfere in anybody's life. I have never interfered
in any way. If somebody wants to assassinate me, I am the last person to
give him any resistance. I will simply welcome him. I will say, "Glad to
meet you. Shoot me and let me be free from the body and its cage." But
if people who love me want to protect me, I am not going to interfere
with their work, either. Those guards have nothing to do with me, they
are managed by people who love me.</p><p>Now, I am an outsider to both the assassin and the guard. It is
between them. They have to settle. I am simply an outsider.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: A TECHNICAL LIMITATION OF FILM, WE HAVE TO PUT A NEW MAGAZINE
ON.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EVEN IN THE ATOMIC AGE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOLLYWOOD ISN'T EASY.…</p><p>YOU SEEM VERY FOND OF THE WILD WEST, HERE IN AMERICA. DO YOU HAVE AN
EQUAL AFFECTION FOR THE WILD WEST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA? DO YOU HAVE ANY
INTENTIONS OF GOING THERE AND TAKING YOUR FOLLOWERS THERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I never function through intentions. I am a man of spontaneity, so
beware. Any time I can come with my whole circus. I may never come. I
never decide for</p><p>the next moment. One moment is enough to live at one time. And nobody
can get two moments together. We always get one moment, so why bother
about other things? -- because while we are bothering about other
moments, this moment will be gone, empty, unlived, and that is the
misery of humanity. They go on thinking of tomorrow and today is
disappearing.</p><p>We are the people who are living in the present. So it is possible.
Q: BUT NOT LIKELY.…</p><p>A: It is likely.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOT AT THIS MOMENT.…</p><p>A: Not at this moment. But perhaps tomorrow morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DO LOVE THIS THEATER, YOU SAID THAT. YOU LAUGHED YESTERDAY...
IT IS A CIRCUS. BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT WILL YOU TIRE OF THIS CIRCUS, THE
TRAPPINGS?</p><p>A: No, never, because it is such a beautiful circus, and changing
continuously. New flowers, new seasons go on coming. I am not tired of
it. And the people who make my circus are not the animals of a circus.
They are the most intelligent people of this earth, the very salt of the
earth. They go on creating something new every day. It is always
new.</p><p>And it is always new also because I never compare anything. Yesterday
is gone. I don't bring it back to compare with today. Tomorrow has not
come. Who cares? It is always new, fresh. People get tired because they
go on comparing.</p><p>Comparison means: you have lived this thing many times, you have seen
this rose flower many times; so slowly, slowly you become blind to it,
you start taking it for granted. I take nothing for granted and my
people take nothing for granted, so every moment we are ready for any
surprise.</p><p>The day I left India, I informed my people to immediately prepare,
that I was going to leave. It was a shock! Ten thousand sannyasins were
settling there, making arrangements, purchasing houses, lands. And
within twenty-four hours' notice I told them to make arrangements, that
I was leaving. And ordinarily I never come back to any place that I have
left in my life. So I am not tired or bored, I am rejoicing in it as
much as possible. (THERE IS A SLIGHT TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH THE
FILM)</p><p>You seem to have in Australia very ancient equipment!</p><p>Q: THIS IS HOLLYWOOD, THIS IS FILM AS DISTINCT FROM MERE TELEVISION,
MERE VIDEOTAPE. BUT THE FINAL LOOK -- YOU TALK OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS --
THE BEAUTY OF THE FILM IS STILL THE</p><p>ESSENCE, I THINK, WHICH IS WHY WE TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME. BUT WHEN
WE GET THERE IT IS WORTH IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WILL NOT GO BACK TO INDIA. EVEN IF THE MADNESS
WERE TO CHANGE, THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PLACE YOU WOULD BE DRAWN TO
AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nothing can be said about it. But in my whole life I have never
gone back. The place I have left, I have left. So looking at my crazy
behavior of the past, it is very unlikely that I will go to India. But
then, one never knows. I am not a reliable person.</p><p>Q: THAT IS YOUR MOST RELIABLE QUALITY.</p><p>WE HAVE HAD A VERY PEACEFUL TIME HERE FOR... IT HAS ONLY BEEN A FEW
DAYS BUT...</p><p><br></p><p>A: Come again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:... GIVEN THE MADNESS THAT WE PARADE AROUND IN FOR MOST OF THE YEAR
IT'S BEEN VERY ENJOYABLE.</p><p>A: Come whenever you feel like having a holiday.</p><p>Q:... THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WITH US. YOU HAVE SO MANY
AUSTRALIANS HERE ALREADY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love you. I see a beautiful human being in front of me, open,
available. I don't see you as a prejudiced man. I don't see you as
unintelligent, and I see every possibility of growing more and more into
higher and higher consciousness. I don't predict ordinarily, but I see
one of my potential sannyasins sitting here in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID YOU FOLLOW OTHERS, AS OTHERS NOW FOLLOW YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I have never followed anybody, and I have never allowed
anybody to follow me. These are my fellow travelers. My sannyasins are
not my followers, they are my friends.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, I THINK I AM JUST A FELLOW TRAVELER TOO. I AM AN ORDINARY
MAN AND I AM AN ORDINARY STORYTELLER. WHEN I ASK</p><p>ABOUT AUSTRALIANS AND YOU SAY WE ARE OPEN... I THINK WE ARE OPEN.</p><p>WHEN SHEELA CAME TO AUSTRALIA, SHE HAS LEARNED YOUR SKILL -- FOR HOW
TO UNSETTLE PEOPLE, SHE HAS MADE PEOPLE burn. IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WIN WITH THAT? WOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE SUPPORT REALLY
TO SHOW...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We don't need any support. I am not a politician seeking for
support. I want to share something, but that is possible only when you
are shocked and disturbed in your sleep. I have to wake you up, and
Sheela has been doing a good job of shaking people and waking people.
She prepares the ground for me. When she has done enough, then perhaps I
may come there to find people with whom I can relate heart to heart. And
there are millions of people in the world who need just a little bit of
shaking and they will be awake. Their sleep is not very deep.</p><p>Q: YOU DO SEEM TO LIKE TO SHAKE THE RICH MOST. MAYBE IT IS THE JINGLE
OF THE COINS IN THE POCKET YOU LIKE TO SHAKE LOOSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: The reason is that the poor man is fast asleep; otherwise he
cannot tolerate his poverty. He needs deep sleep. He needs some opium
given by the politicians, by the priests. His sleep is not just ordinary
sleep, it is narcotic. The rich man needs no consolation from anybody.
The rich man is not worried about heaven and hell. He knows he can
purchase everything -- the priest, his God, his heaven, his hell --
everything can be purchased. He is not in the same situation as the poor
man, he can be easily awakened. Between the poor man and me there is a
great distance.</p><p>Q: AND THE BLACK MAN? THERE ARE FEW BLACKS HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: A few blacks have come... because they are as beautiful people as
anyone. The problem is, once a person comes here and just gives us a
little chance to shake him and wake him, he is not going to leave the
place. So those few black people had come just for three months to live
with us -- we had invited anybody to come and live with us for three
months -- and they have remained.</p><p>Many have gone, but they go on continuously writing to us that they
miss us and would like to come back because for the first time they had
been treated as human beings. For the first time a white man has hugged
a black woman or a black man has hugged a white woman, made love to a
white woman. For the first time he was not thought to be second rate. He
was respected, just the way everybody else is respected. There was no
discrimination.</p><p>The problem is, people are afraid to come, because the politicians
are making them afraid. The religious leaders are making them afraid,
creating all kinds of rumors, preventing them from coming here, because
they know perfectly well</p><p>that anybody who comes here with open eyes, alert mind, is going to
fall in love with this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT IS VERY PEACEFUL. I SAY THAT TO YOU, THAT ANY VISITOR HERE
FINDS IT PEACEFUL.</p><p>ONE OF THE RUMORS ABOUT THE PLACE IS ABOUT THAT SIDE OF FREE LOVE. IF
THERE IS THIS MUCH FREE LOVE HERE, WHY THE RUBBER GLOVES IN THE HOTEL
ROOMS? WHAT HAS CHANGED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is being careful about my people. They should take every
precaution that they don't get AIDS, which is spreading fast. There is
no cure for it. Once you have AIDS, at the maximum you have only two
years more to live. That is the maximum. Most probably within six months
you will be finished.</p><p>I would not like my people to be finished that ugly way. Love is
free, AIDS is not free.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ARE MORE CERTAIN ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAN SCIENTISTS
THAT I HAVE TALKED TO. WHAT IS IT? HOW DOES AN ORDINARY MAN BECOME A
GURU, BHAGWAN, WITH SUCH CLARITY AND CERTAINTY ABOUT THESE THINGS?</p><p>A: Only an ordinary man can become so certain, so clear. The
extraordinary man is so much burdened with his ego, with his
knowledgeability, with his schizophrenic mind, with all kinds of
arguments.</p><p>I am reminded of Immanuel Kant, one of the most important
philosophers of the West. A woman fell in love with him. He said, "I
will have to think about it." Now, you don't think about love -- either
yes or no -- but Immanuel Kant is a big philosopher. He thought about it
for three years and he managed to find all the arguments for marriage
and against marriage. The trouble was, they were equal. After three
years he went to the woman's house, knocked on the door. He had gone to
say, "Forgive me, I cannot decide. The arguments are equal,
fifty-fifty." But the woman was not there.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PLEASE FINISH.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Let them change (THE FILM).</p><p>Q: TALKING TO AUSTRALIANS WILL NOT BE LIKE "GOOD MORNING, AMERICA."
WE DON'T PLAN TO EXHAUST YOU. THERE IS ENOUGH WIT AND WISDOM AND MAGIC
AND THEATER ALREADY IN WHAT WE HAVE TO FILL TWICE THE LENGTH OF OUR
TELEVISION PROGRAM. BUT THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MORE SPECIAL QUESTIONS THAT
I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BRING TO YOU, IF YOU COULD.</p><p>A: Okay.</p><p>Q: THE DAM THAT YOU HAVE HERE IS NAMED AFTER GURDJIEFF. THIS IS NOT
THE QUESTION FOR THE CAMERA, BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IT. HE WAS ALSO A
FELLOW TRAVELER ON THE ROAD. WAS HE TO YOU AT LEAST, IF NOT AN
INSPIRATION, WAS HE A REMARKABLE MAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He was an immensely remarkable man. In fact nobody else has been
so remarkable in this century. But he was an ordinary man. He never
claimed that he was a prophet. He lived just like an ordinary man, but
he was most remarkable. His insight and clarity are just
inconceivable.</p><p>Q: HE MOVED, WHEREAS YOU SIT STILL. DO YOU THINK ONE IS SUPERIOR? HE
SEEMS TO BE A TRAVELER; WHEREAS YOU ARE TRAVELING HERE, BUT YOU
PHYSICALLY REST ANYWHERE. IT SEEMS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU WHERE
YOU ARE IN THAT SENSE. DO YOU THINK ONE IS A SUPERIOR CHOICE TO THE
OTHER, OR...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, there is no question of any superiority. It is just with whom
your heart starts beating. It is just a question of liking, loving.
Somebody may like Mozart and somebody may not like. Somebody may like
Vincent van Gogh and somebody will think him crazy, mad. (SOME PROBLEM
WITH THE VIDEO EQUIPMENT) If you are ready, I have to finish my
answer.</p><p>Q: HE STILL HAS HIS HANDS IN THE MAGIC BAG.</p><p>A: So when he is ready, please tell me, because I don't forget
anything. You can talk about things that you don't want to put on the
film.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, WITHOUT GIVING YOU THE WIT AND WISDOM OF YET ANOTHER
ORDINARY MAN, ONE THING MIGHT BE USEFUL MAYBE MORE TO THE RAJNEESHEES,
BUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE SILLY, THE TOY SOLDIERS THAT YOU HAVE HERE. I
KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING IT OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU, BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME
OUT OF KILTER WITH THE SERENITY OF THE PLACE, THAT PROBABLY THE MORE
PEACEFUL SIDE OF WHAT YOU DO HERE IN THIS OASIS IN THE DESERT IS ENOUGH
DEFENSE WITHOUT THE WILD WEST TRAPPINGS. I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO ME WHAT
GOVERNMENTS AND ARMIES DO, AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE RAJNEESHEES
NEED TO BE THE SAME AS THE REST.</p><p>A: You have not been here long enough. And you have not seen... I
have been attacked...</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE...?</p><p><br></p><p>A:... many times.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HERE THOUGH, OR IN INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In India. Efforts were made to poison me, to kill me.</p><p>I know, those guns are silly. In an age which is nuclear, they are
carrying toy guns. But what is the harm, if they enjoy and they feel
that they are doing something?</p><p>Q: IT DOESN'T UPSET YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is perfectly okay. Let them enjoy. They are toys, but what they
are doing -- their love is not a toy. They cannot have nuclear weapons,
otherwise they would have nuclear weapons too. Whatsoever they can. (THE
FILM IS READY)</p><p><br></p><p>A: I come back.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PICK UP ON WHERE WE WERE TALKING? A: YES.</p><p>Q: YOU SAID THAT IMMANUEL KANT COULDN'T CHOOSE...</p><p>A: Yes, that will do.</p><p><br></p><p>Q BETWEEN ONE VERY SIMPLE MATTER OF LOVE. COULD I INTERJECT</p><p>AND ASK YOU SOMETHING ON THAT. ?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just wait. Let me finish, because I had not finished it.</p><p>He knocked on the woman's door. There was no woman. An old man opened
the door and recognized Immanuel Kant. Kant asked about the woman.</p><p>He said, "She was my daughter, but she has been married for three
years and she has two children, too. She does not live in this town
anymore. What business do you have with my daughter? You go and think a
little more."</p><p>Thinkers are the most clumsy people in the world, most indecisive. I
am not a thinker. I simply SEE, and whatsoever I see I say it without
bothering about the consequences. I am an absolutely open person --
nothing private in me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE SAME QUESTION THEN, THAT IMMANUEL KANT HAD TO ANSWER, THE YES
OR NO ABOUT LOVE. ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH SHEELA? IS SHE YOUR. ?</p><p>A: I am in love with so many women around the world. Sheela, of
course, is one of them. But I cannot point out a single woman that I
love. I LOVE, and my love is not addressed to anybody in particular. And
I have loved so many women, I don't think anybody else could have
managed it. Even Gurdjieff is far behind me in that matter. He loved
many women, but not more than a dozen.</p><p>Q: IF SHEELA IS THAT SPECIAL, IS SHEELA THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE?
IS SHE THE HEIR APPARENT TO YOUR SPIRITUAL KINGDOM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There is no power, no kingdom. I am here. She is just a fellow
traveler, as others.</p><p>Q: IT IS A KINGDOM WITH MORE ROLLS ROYCES THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE
WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is true. I am a man of very simple taste. I like the best of
anything -- this is certainly true. I would like this city to be in many
ways the only city in the world which has that capacity. Certainly, we
have ninety or more Rolls Royces. No city of a comparable membership can
claim that. In every way: we don't have a single beggar, we don't have a
single thief, we don't have any crime, no murder in four years -- in
America, where twenty percent of the presidents are being murdered -- no
prostitution.</p><p>In many ways this place is unique, and we are going to make it more
and more unique and beautiful. Just the stupid politicians cannot
understand a simple thing: that we are not doing any harm to anybody.
Don't prevent us from doing things which are not harmful. But they go
on, they are so afraid. The governor goes on speaking against us and we
have been inviting him, "First come and just visit. Be here and see the
people and the place, then if you feel to speak against, speak against.
We have no problem with that. But at least be acquainted, at least be a
gentleman."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE JONESTOWN TO US.</p><p>A: It is just exactly the opposite of Jonestown. They were
death-oriented. We are life-oriented. We love to enjoy everything. They
were just an unintelligent group of people -- mostly black, uneducated,
knowing nothing -- following this man who was telling them that if they
go with him, they will enter into the kingdom of God. We are creating
the kingdom of God here. In fact, we are waiting for God to knock on our
doors some day and say, "Let me come in."</p><p>We are just the opposite. Reverend Jim Jones and his people are
really the logical conclusion of Jesus and the Christian theology.</p><p>Q: NOT THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THE POWER OF ONE MAN OVER A GROUP OF
PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That was exactly what Jesus was doing. That is exactly what the
popes have been doing. That is why I say he is the logical conclusion
from Jesus through all the popes and all the Christian theologians. They
have all been trying to prove the power, the glory of Jesus, his
specialness and his special connection with God. And if you follow him
then you need not worry about the future. He will take care of you.</p><p>Here I teach people that nobody can take care of you. I am not your
savior. I am not going to help you in any way to enter into the kingdom
of God, but I can explain to you how we can live here in the kingdom of
beauty, love, joy. To me GOD is a dead word. It is a dirty word, a four
letter word.</p><p>Q: I THINK I ACTUALLY WOULD PREFER TO END OUR INTERVIEW WITH
SOMETHING YOU SAID A BIT EARLIER, AS FAR AS THE WAY WE STRUCTURE THE
BEAUTY OF SOMETHING AS YOU SAID EARLIER, RATHER THAN THE UGLINESS OF
JONESTOWN. SO, AS FAR AS THE TELEVISION PART, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO
YOU A LITTLE MORE, IF WE CAN TURN THE CAMERAS OFF UNTIL THEY NEED TO GET
A FEW MORE SHOTS OF US SITTING HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF WE COULD CONTINUE TALKING.… WAIT A SECOND, LET'S GET THESE
MICROPHONES OFF</p><p>A: Do whatsoever you want to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: FOR OUR PURPOSES, WE ARE TRYING, I SUPPOSE, IN THE SPACE OF THE
VERY CONDENSED TELEVISION PROGRAM TO GET YOUR ESSENCE, AND THAT IS AS
MUCH, I THINK, THE FEELING OF WHAT WE HAVE HAD THESE THREE DAYS. IT IS
TRYING TO COMPRESS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING -- FOR FIFTY-THREE YEARS OR
FIFTY-THREE LIFETIMES -- INTO A SIXTY-MINUTE PROGRAM, WHICH IS ALMOST AN
IMPOSSIBLE TASK. BUT WE DID THINK THAT WE HAVE CAUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF
OUR FILM SOME OF THE MAGIC AND THE TRANQUILITY OF THIS EXPERIENCE.</p><p>A: Good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING THAT I ENJOY THE CIRCUS AND THE
THEATER OF IT AS MUCH AS... MAYBE THAT IS CLOSE TO A</p><p>SPIRITUAL FEELING. BUT TO ME YOU ARE TRULY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is right.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL SENSE OF HUMOR. AND WHERE DID YOU LEARN SUCH
TIMING?</p><p>A: I have never learned anything. I just go on doing naturally
whatsoever I feel to do. Whatsoever I have to say, I say it, because I
don't have any obligation to anybody, and I don't have any commitment to
anybody. I don't belong to any party line. I am absolutely free to be
funny, to be shocking. I don't even bother about contradicting myself,
because to me it seems that a man who remains consistent his whole life
must be an idiot. A growing person has to contradict himself many times,
because who knows what tomorrow brings in? Tomorrow may cancel this day
completely. And I am ready to go with life with no hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID YOU LOVE THOSE CONTRADICTIONS WHEN YOU WERE A DEBATER MANY
YEARS AGO?</p><p>A: I have always loved the contradictions, because for me
contradictions have something of tremendous value. They appear
contradictions to the intellect, but the deeper you go into them, you
will find they are compensatory, they are not contradictions. They
somehow depend on each other; if one disappears, the other will not be
there. For example, if there had been no British rule in India there
would have been no Mahatma Gandhi -- no possibility. If there had been
no Adolf Hitler, forget all about Churchill and Roosevelt and Stalin.
Life exists in such a way that it makes contradictions, complementaries.
I have always loved them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU BE HAPPY THEN, IF WHAT YOU INSPIRED OUT OF THIS BRIEF
PART OF A VERY LONG JOURNEY, IF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO NOW FOLLOW YOU
IN FACT WANDERED OFF TO SOME OTHER SPHERE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS TO
THEM, THEMSELVES?</p><p>A: I will be happy and I will bless them to go there, because they
have come here to seek some truth, some tranquility, some sanity. If
they feel they can get it better somewhere else, I will be the first
person to send them and help them to go. I have been doing that for
years. In fact, I have had to do it in such a way that they don't feel
they are leaving me. Even against their will, I had to bless them and
tell them to go. I knew that they loved me, but now their minds were
in</p><p>difficulty; they wanted to go somewhere else, but their love for me
had become an attachment. I had to destroy that attachment -- only then
could they go.</p><p>And I have been destroying many attachments for their sake, because I
don't want anybody to be a slave. Out of freedom they have come to me,
out of freedom they should go. And if they want to remain here, out of
freedom they should remain here. This is not a concentration camp. It is
a meditation camp.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THIS HAS BEEN NOT SO MUCH AN INTERVIEW AS A CONVERSATION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I loved it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I HAVE WRITTEN IT HERE, ANYWAY. I WILL FIND OUT LATER HOW MUCH IS
ON THE TELEVISION FILM, BUT.…</p><p>A: Do whatsoever you feel like doing. Just remember one thing: I love
you, and whenever you feel alone sad, tired, come here. Again and again,
come here. Good.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-5>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 15.]</p><p>Howard Sattler 6PR RADIO, AUSTRALIA</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE THE CHAMPAGNE, I HAVE THE WATER. YOU SAY
YOU'RE AN ORDINARY MAN. WHERE DOES THAT PLACE THE REST OF US?</p><p><br></p><p>Answer: You will be drinking water and I will not be touching the
champagne. There is the difference.</p><p>Q: YOU AND PARTICULARLY YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE CREATED QUITE AN IMPACT
ON WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WHERE I COME FROM, THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS --
THEIR COMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS, AND THEIR EFFORTS TO START A COMMUNITY
SCHOOL IN OUR SOUTHWEST. THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOU, ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE. COULD YOU TELL THEM WHAT SORT OF PERSON
YOU ARE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't know at all. I just live moment to moment, so you cannot
confine me into a personality. You cannot define me, you cannot predict
me. I don't know even myself what I am going to do tomorrow morning. I
am simply as open as the existence, and as indefinable as the existence
itself. So people have to figure out whatsoever they want. I am
available. There are people who love me, there are people who would like
to kill me. They have chosen different parts of me. They have focused
their eyes according to their prejudices. But I am not concerned in any
way about the opinion of others. I don't have any opinion about other
people, any judgment about other people.</p><p>Q: ARE YOU A THREAT TO THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEIR FUTURES? MANY PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE.</p><p>A: Perhaps. If you don't understand what I am saying, I am a threat,
certainly. But if they understand what I am saying, they will rejoice,
there is no threat. In</p><p>fact, I want to make these people contemporaries. They are not.
Somebody is hanging two thousand years back with Jesus Christ, somebody
is hanging even farther back with Moses or Buddha. These people
certainly will feel me a threat because I belong to the present.</p><p>I want them to come to the present, otherwise there is no hope for
humanity. These people are simply walking corpses, burdened with the
whole load of the past -- ugly, superstitious. Certainly I am a threat
to their superstitions. I am a threat to their rotten theologies. I am a
threat to their concepts about morality, God, religion, about everything
they have that is out of date. Certainly they will feel threatened
because that's how they have become identified in their own eyes, and it
is always difficult to change.</p><p>Whenever a man like me is there, there are not two ways: either you
have to be with me or you have to be against me.</p><p>Q: DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO BECOME RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, there is no need. They have to become contemporaries, that's
enough. Rajneeshees are not an alternative. It is simply the groundwork
for the contemporary man to begin with. Once the world has understood
that we have to live in the present, not in the past, Rajneeshees will
simply dissolve. It is not something that I would like to remain forever
and forever, it is a simple device to challenge people, to bring them to
their senses. And once our work is done they don't need to become
Rajneeshees, they need to become contemporaries. And the moment they are
contemporaries, our work is done. Rajneeshees will simply melt and
dissolve into the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU CERTAINLY CHALLENGE PEOPLE'S TRADITIONAL VALUES, AND THAT'S
ONE OF THE THINGS I BELIEVE MAKES YOUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT. DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERATE AND LOOK FOR THE END RESULT
RATHER THAN THE IMMEDIATE REACTION?</p><p>A: I don't care about the end result. My whole concern is not
diplomatic, not political. I am simply responding with my totality to
anything that comes in front of me. I cannot be cunning. What you are
saying to me -- be a little more cunning</p><p>-- I cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not a politician. That is the ugliest thing that can happen
to a man. I am not diplomatic. I do not want people to be manipulated
politely. I am not a hypocrite, I simply say the truth as it is. If it
hurts, it is your problem. If it creates enemies I am not worried,
because the enemies are the first step to becoming my</p><p>friends. They have already recognized me in their hate. They have
already recognized their defeat and death. Now nobody can save them.
They cannot ignore me. If they can ignore me, then there is no threat
for them. That's why I have to be intense, fiery, and I have to hammer
hard on each traditional value, because the only thing that I would not
like is to be ignored.</p><p>Q: YOU CERTAINLY WON'T BE IGNORED, I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.</p><p>A: Thank you for the compliment.</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I COME FROM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHERE
YOUR RAJNEESHEES HAVE GOT TO GET APPROVAL FROM GOVERNMENTS, FROM
POLITICIANS, TO GO AHEAD WITH THEIR PROJECTS THERE. WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE
TO THEM IF THE POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WITH GUNS?</p><p>A: No. Legal methods are available. Those politicians themselves are
claiming that they are democratic. Use their own democracy and fight
with them. They are saying that their judicial system is fair? Use it
and fight them. Guns are just barbarous.</p><p>Q: YOU WOULD NEVER USE GUNS OR CONDONE THAT SORT OF...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I myself will never even touch a gun. My advice to the people who
belong to me is to be intelligent, use your intelligence. And against
those idiotic politicians it is a simple matter: we are going to use
their own devices for their own destruction. We need not use any
guns.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR PERSONAL SECRETARY, SHEELA, CREATED AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT IN
WESTERN AUSTRALIA. CERTAINLY SHE WAS PROBABLY NUMBER ONE ENTERTAINMENT
FOR AROUND ABOUT A MONTH ON RADIO AND TELEVISION OVER THERE. BUT I
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY SHE HANDLED
THINGS. YOU THOUGHT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT TOUGHER.</p><p><br></p><p>A: She could have been. Q: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.</p><p>A: And I have been very tough with her because I don't see any limit
anywhere. You can go in any direction infinitely. Sheela is not ever
going to satisfy me. She is doing her best, but I would like her to do a
little more... more.</p><p>Q: WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD COME NEXT TIME.</p><p>A: First she has to go on preparing the ground for me. One day I am
going to come.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TO AUSTRALIA, TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. When Sheela comes, that means I am coming. Q: SHE'S
GETTING US READY, IS SHE?</p><p>A: Yes. She is coming again. She will come again and again, and
prepare the ground. And she will hit people more and more, and their
values more and more, so they become ready. Because when I come, then
comes the final hit.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ALL YOUR OPPONENTS WILL BE ALMOST KNOCKED OUT BY THEN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just tell your people, "Be ready."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THERE?</p><p>A: I cannot say that now because I don't know myself When I come
there and I see the situation and I feel the atmosphere, then whatsoever
happens in me as a response.… I never prepare myself for anything. I am
not an actor. No rehearsal. I simply start the drama without knowing
what is going to happen.</p><p>We will see it. And up to now everything has gone well.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT SURE HAS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU LIVE IN
OREGON IS BECAUSE THE WEATHER SUITS YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDICAL
CONDITION. THE WEATHER IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA IS ALMOST THE SAME AS
OREGON.</p><p>A: That's great! It may become my permanent residence.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR OPPONENTS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly not. But wherever I am the situation is the same. I will
find my friends, I will find my enemies. Both belong to me. In fact,
they are two polarities, complementaries. There is nothing wrong in
it.</p><p>Q: YOU SAID JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT YOU ARE NOT AN ACTOR. BUT A
LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT CLASS YOU AS ONE OF THE GREAT COMEDIANS OF THIS
WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHERE DOES THE TALENT COME FROM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just because I don't expect any respectability from anybody. So I
can act the way I want. I can be funny without any trouble. I have
nothing to lose, because in the first place I have never expected the
world to praise me and give me Nobel prizes and this and that. I have
everything that I need, and it is within me. And I am completely
fulfilled. Now I can be crazy, mad, a comedian. I am absolutely free to
be anything. I can afford anything, even to be a madman. But it is
within my control. And I enjoy the whole show so much.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ENJOY THE LAUGHS?</p><p>A Yes</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes</p><p>Q: YOU'VE SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN BE A MADMAN. I DON'T THINK
YOU ARE A MADMAN AT ALL. BUT THERE ARE MADMEN AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I'D ASK YOU, IF I COULD, IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON
SOME OF THEM. THE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I said to you I can be a madman, and that is possible only if I am
not mad. I can enjoy being mad, but I am not mad. That's why I can enjoy
it. The madman has become identified with his madness. One thing is
absolutely certain about every madman: he will never accept that he is
mad. The religious leaders are mostly mad people, fanatics, and just
because they are mad, fanatic, they gather all kinds of idiots around
them.</p><p>Q: WHOLE NATIONS SOMETIMES, LIKE IRAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes... because most human beings are retarded. Scientifically, the
average mental age of a human being is below thirteen. Now if thirteen
is your mental age, you may be seventy years old, but you can be
exploited, you can be</p><p>conditioned for any nonsense. You can be made afraid of hell, for
which no evidence exists. You can be motivated. Your greed can be
aroused for heaven, for which no evidence exists. You can be conditioned
to pray to a God who is the greatest lie in the world.</p><p>And the wonder of wonders is that even in your supreme courts, where
you have your best judges, the cream, the oath has to be taken in the
name of God. The oath to be truthful, in the name of the greatest lie!
None of those judges have seen God, none of those judges have any idea
what God is. But it is being used. Most of humanity is so mediocre that
it can follow any madman. The madman just has to be a little
methodological, and the religious madmen are very methodological. There
is no contradiction in being methodological.</p><p>Methodology does not need intelligence. Now, what is the methodology
of Jesus? -- "I am the only begotten son of God." And the mediocre
people are going to believe it, because not to believe in it is to go to
hell and suffer for eternity. Nobody wants to suffer for eternity. As it
is, one is suffering enough already. One wants some relief. Even if the
relief comes after death, one wants to live peacefully and joyously, not
starving, not sick, not old, not ugly. Naturally, simple methodology --
"I am the only begotten son of God, I can save you, I have come to save
the whole world, those who believe in me I will choose for paradise, and
those who don't believe in me will fall into an abysmal darkness of
hell" -- a very simple methodology. And the suffering, the poor, the
starving, the uneducated, the downtrodden, the oppressed, exploited are
ready to cling to any hope.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY?</p><p>A: Because there is nothing in their life. It is so empty that if
there is no hope for them they will commit suicide. Then there is no
other way. For what should they go on, continue dragging their empty
lives? Just to suffer? Just to get hit, just to be crushed under the
boots of people who are in power? The hope helps.</p><p>And that is the methodology of all the religions: give people hope.
But the strategy is very cunning: keep the hope beyond death -- because
they know perfectly well that hope in this life cannot be fulfilled, and
then these same people who are their followers will kill them. So keep
the hope beyond death. You can never be caught. Nobody comes back from
death to say that these people are lying. So they go on lying, and the
more a lie is repeated, day by day, year by year, century by century,
for thousands of years... it almost starts sounding as if it is
true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO IS THE POPE A FRAUD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. Absolutely. All religions up to now have been fraud.
They have deceived people and because of their deception humanity has
continued to</p><p>suffer. Otherwise, we have enough intelligence. If we can reach to
the moon, do you think we cannot manage enough food for humanity?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PERHAPS WE ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY REACHING THE MOON.</p><p>A: That, too, is foolish. If you cannot feed people here, what are
you going to do on the moon? Seventy-five percent of every nation's
income, even poor nations, is going into construction for the coming
war. Everybody is getting ready.</p><p>Q: IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?</p><p>A: If all these people are getting ready and getting excited about
it, any fool can start it. My effort is that it should not happen, but
the only way to prevent it is to make human beings more alert, so that
they cannot be exploited by priests and politicians. And that's what I
am doing. Naturally, politicians are against me -- all kinds of
politicians. It is a miracle: the capitalist is against me, the
socialist is against me, the communist is against me, the fascist is
against me. It is simply a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU'RE A CAPITALIST HERE, RUNNING A COMMUNE.</p><p>A: I am not a capitalist. I use capital as a servant. It is not my
political ideology. I want people to live richly in every possible way.
Luxury should be available to everybody. I don't want people to become
equally poor and call it communism. I want people to become equally
rich, and then whatever name you want to call it, you can call it. Names
don't matter.</p><p>Q: IS THAT SORT OF WEALTH AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF, LET'S SAY,
INDIA, THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT MOTHER TERESA TRIES TO HELP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: These people like Mother Teresa, who have been helping the poor
for centuries, are really the causes for continuing poverty. The poor
cannot be helped the way Mother Teresa is helping. This is not help.
This is politics, because all those orphans she helps are transformed,
converted into Catholic Christianity. In fact, Mother Teresa would be
out of a job if there were no orphans in. India. She needs more orphans.
That's why they are all against birth control methods, against abortion.
Otherwise, where are you going to get orphans? They need the poor,
because without the poor whom are you going to serve? And without
service you cannot reach heaven. This is a simple strategy to reach
heaven.</p><p>I love one story: It happened in China that a man fell into a well.
It was the annual fair and there was so much noise that nobody took any
note that he was</p><p>shouting, "Save me!" A Buddhist monk passed by. He looked into the
well and told the man that there was no need to cry and scream. "Accept
whatsoever is the case, be contented. In the next life you will be
fulfilled a thousandfold." The man said, "I am not here to listen to
philosophy. I am dying and you are talking philosophy. First, please
help me to get out."</p><p>The Buddhist said, "That is against my religion, to interfere into
the actions and the consequences of somebody else. You must have
committed some sin in your past life. You have fallen into the well. Be
happy that your sin is finished, your punishment is over. But I am not
going to take you out, because tomorrow if you murder somebody then I
will also be responsible for it. I am not going to be responsible for
any murder." And he went away.</p><p>The man could not believe it: "These Buddhists talk about compassion.
I am dying and he talks philosophy. I am not in a state even to
understand what he is saying."</p><p>And just after him came a Confucian monk. In the old days in China
the wells had no walls surrounding them, so it was very easy to fall
into them in the darkness, there was no preventive measure. The
Confucian monk said, "Listen, you are the proof of what my master has
said. My master has said that every well should have walls around it.
Don't be worried. I am going to create a great revolution in the whole
country, so that every well is well protected." The man said, "But when
will the revolution happen? And when will all the wells have walls? By
that time I will be gone."</p><p>The Confucian said, "You are not the question. Individuals come and
go. It is a question for the whole society. We cannot bother about a
single individual, we think in terms of the whole civilization." And he
went away to create revolution. And then came a Christian monk with a
bag hanging on his shoulder. He took out a rope from the bag, threw it
in, took the man out. The man was immensely grateful, fell at his feet
and said, "You are the only religious man. But tell me how you guessed
that somebody has fallen into the well. And you came with the rope...
why are you carrying the rope?" He said, "We carry everything in this
bag for emergency purposes, anywhere. Somebody will need to be served,
and our lord Jesus Christ has said that those who serve will receive
immense rewards in heaven."</p><p>Now, think of a world where nobody is in need of anybody's service;
everybody is happy, healthy, comfortable, luxurious. What will happen to
the great Christian servants and saints? They will simply be out of a
job. They need poverty to remain. That is their very source of becoming
saints, holier than thou. I don't say to my people, "Go and serve the
poor." Service, to me, is not a beautiful word.</p><p>I say to my people, "If you have something, share it. But remember
one thing: there is no reward beyond it. Sharing, enjoy -- that is the
reward. If you pull out somebody who is drowning in a well, that's a
great joy. What more reward do you want? You saved a life; you should be
immensely happy. The reward is in</p><p>the act itself and the punishment also in the act itself They are not
extrinsic, they are intrinsic."</p><p>But all these religions have been telling people the reward is
somewhere far away -- beyond death, and punishment, too. Neither can it
be proved, nor can it be disproved; hence their business goes on and on,
and mediocre people go on following it. If all these religions disappear
two things are possible: either the poor will die out of poverty...
Ethiopia will disappear. So what? -- it is better that Ethiopia
disappears from the earth, rather than thousands of people dying in
hunger. And in hunger you don't die in a day; a man can live hungry for
three months. He will become just a skeleton, and what is the point of
these three months of torture?</p><p>So, there are two alternatives if all these great servants of people
don't interfere. Either countries like Ethiopia, India, other poor
countries will disappear. Let</p><p>them disappear. This earth cannot manage so many people.</p><p>Q: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS WHO HAVE DONATED
TO BUY FOOD FOR ETHIOPIANS WHO ARE DYING OF HUNGER, DYING OF WAR?</p><p>A: It does not help. It simply will save a few Ethiopians, who will
produce more Ethiopians.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE SHOULD STOP AID TO ETHIOPIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You should completely stop, because the world needs only
one-fourth of the population that it has right now. Only then can people
be peaceful, living comfortably, joyously. There is no need. What is the
point? I have been in India for fifty years, and for thirty years I have
been teaching people that birth control is absolutely essential, that
abortion is absolutely essential. And they were throwing stones at me,
knives at me, shoes at me; that was my reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AND PERHAPS SOUTH AMERICA, OPPRESSED
COUNTRIES, SHOULD THERE BE A MORATORIUM ON ALL BIRTHS FOR, SAY, TWENTY
YEARS?</p><p>A: That's what I said, that there should be total birth control for
twenty or thirty years.</p><p>That's what I was saying, that there are two possibilities. One, the
poor will disappear. Please don't serve them, be compassionate. Your
service is not compassion, your service is your greed for heaven. You
are using human people and their poverty for your own joys in heaven --
beautiful women who are always young, who don't even perspire and don't
need any deodorant.</p><p>In the Mohammedan heaven there are rivers of wine. You cannot get
water in the Mohammedan heaven, only wine. Here it is a crime, here it
is a sin. And the same thing that is sin here -- Mohammedans are against
alcohol; by a miracle, the same wine becomes virtue. Saints are enjoying
it. To look at somebody else's wife with lustful eyes is sin. And your
saints, what are they doing in heaven? They are not married, there is no
marriage in heaven. They are enjoying all kinds of women.</p><p>Be compassionate. Either let the poor die, or if you are REALLY
compassionate, then stop this wastage of your energy and money for war
efforts and drop these boundaries between nations. Let there be only one
government -- which is enough! There is no need for America and Soviet
Union and India and Ethiopia. Just let there be one global
government.</p><p>Q: WHO WOULD BE ITS PRESIDENT, RONALD REAGAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly not!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU?</p><p>A: No! Not I, because I don't want to get into any stupid mess. Not
Reagan, because if the world is one, people will find a better, wiser
man. Because the world will be available to choose, and they will not
choose Reagan, with a chimpanzee as his friend. There are wiser people
in the world.</p><p>And the moment nations are not there, war is impossible. Seventy-five
percent of the income of the whole world can change the whole scene.
There will be nobody who is poor. There is no need for anybody to be
poor. And if there is one world, all scientific effort will become
creative. Right now it is destructive, right now it prepares only for
war; but when there is no need for any war all scientific minds will
take a 180-degree turn. It will be creative. We can create so much that
nobody will bother about paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN? YOU'RE ENOUGH OF A
REALIST TO KNOW THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN TOMORROW.</p><p>A: I don't know. I am simply saying that these are the two
alternatives. Either let the poor die and don't make a fuss about it,
or, if you are really concerned, then let the nations disappear so there
is no need for war. And scientific efforts automatically will go towards
making more comfort, more luxury, more health, longer life. I am not
concerned what happens, I am simply saying these are the only two
alternatives. There is no third alternative. And I am telling my people
to spread the word all over the world. Four years we have been here, and
not a single baby has been born. Just simple intelligence is needed.</p><p>Q: BUT WHY NO BABIES HERE? PEOPLE HERE, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, COULD
AFFORD TO PROCREATE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. If they want to live really joyously and luxuriously, there is
no need. If they want freedom and equality between man and woman, then
it is better to avoid babies.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT SURELY THE HUMAN RACE WILL DIE OUT OF EXISTENCE IF EVERYBODY
DOES THAT?</p><p>A: No, no. I am not saying that. My proposal is that people stop this
accidental creation of babies and start looking for a more scientific
way. Any man, any woman who wants a baby, should be given permission by
the medical board. It does not matter if the medical board says to the
husband, "You are not the right person for this woman. You will have to
take some semen, either from the hospital bank or from somebody whom we
propose, to make this woman pregnant. Then your child will be a
genius."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE TEST-TUBE BABY PROGRAM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am absolutely in favor of scientific production of children. Q:
A MASTER RACE.</p><p>A: Right now it is mass production -- and accidental. That will not
be mass production and it will not be accidental. It will be
intelligent, and we will not be producing in a factory. There is no need
for so many people to be produced, we need only a few people. And as
science goes on serving humanity and human needs, people will be living
longer and longer, and we will need fewer and fewer new people. It is an
absolute certainty that we have the capacity to live at least three
hundred years.</p><p>There is no question of mass production. And even if you want to call
this mass production, so what? If it is better than your individual,
haphazard way of production, not knowing what you are doing, not knowing
what is happening.… You are just making love to a woman, absolutely
unconscious of what is going on in the biology, of what kind of child is
going to be born: blind, deaf, retarded, mad, sick from the very birth,
crippled.… You call it an intelligent way? The intelligent way will be
that we can manage that the best human seeds meet together from the very
beginning. And we can program -- now it has become possible -- we can
program the egg and the semen cell for anything. It is a question of
giving a certain program.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, I AM FIFTEEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM HOME, AND EVEN NOW
I THINK I CAN HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DESTROY THEIR
FREEDOM OF CHOICE.</p><p>A: Let them scream. It will give them good exercise. I call it
Dynamic Meditation. I am always for scientific, intelligent efforts
because all religions and political efforts have failed. Now there is
only one thing left, and that is science. Let us try it once. If that
too fails, that means life is impossible on this earth. Perhaps it has
come to its death point.</p><p>Q: IF YOUR PREDICTIONS ARE CORRECT IT WILL BE AIDS THAT WILL REDUCE
AND CONTAIN THE WORLD'S POPULATION, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID THAT IT WILL
KILL TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE HERE HAVE GONE TO EXTREME LENGTHS
TO STOP IT INFILTRATING YOUR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE CONDOMS AND RUBBER
GLOVES SUPPLIED TO ALL. MEDICAL SCIENTISTS, HOWEVER, ARE CLOSELY
MONITORING AIDS, AND THEY SAY THAT ONLY A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE
AFFECTED. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO KILL SO MANY PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is absolutely clear, simple arithmetic. It is scientifically
certain now that there is no remedy for AIDS. The man who has it is
going to die within two years' time. Two years is the maximum limit. He
may die within six months or two months or six weeks or today, but he
cannot live more than two years. And medicine has nothing to help. There
is no way, because AIDS is not an ordinary disease. It is a very strange
disease. It simply destroys your resistance against diseases. You become
vulnerable to all infections, all contagions. Nothing inside you is
there to fight against it, it is as if the very life force has
disappeared.</p><p>And this man who has AIDS can have many contacts. Before he became
aware, he may have had many contacts, sexual relationships. He must have
given AIDS to those people, and they will be spreading it. And now it is
known that it can be given to a person even by kissing -- not even
sexual intercourse is needed -- because saliva carries the disease.
Kissing should be absolutely illegal.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Rub your noses. There are tribes who don't kiss, they just rub
their noses and enjoy. I don't see that there is any problem. And noses
are hygienic. Find some other alternative. But kissing cannot be in
favor of human life anymore. It can pass, they suspect, even through
breathing. That's why I say it can spread like wildfire.</p><p>I would not like my people to die from AIDS. Dying is not a problem.
I am not afraid of death, but death should be a celebration, it should
come out in a joyful,</p><p>blissful mood. We celebrate death here. We dance, we sing. This is
the final goodbye to the person whom we have loved and with whom we have
known many beautiful moments. What more can we do? But dying from AIDS
will not be a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HOMOSEXUALS? -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN BLAMED
FOR SPREADING MOST OF THE AIDS.</p><p>A: They are all perverse. But the religions are responsible for
homosexuality, it is a religious perversion. The first homosexuals
happened in monasteries where men were not allowed to see women, in
nunneries where women were not allowed to see men. There are monasteries
where for one thousand years not even a six-month-old female baby has
entered. It is not allowed. Sometimes I wonder! A six-month-old female
baby is not allowed to go inside... are there monks living there, or
monsters? But they have become monsters. They are not meditating, they
are masturbating.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY TELL US THEY'RE CELIBATE.</p><p>A: They go on telling that to the whole world. But they should come
to the scientific lab and prove it. How can they be celibate? Nobody can
be celibate. It is just as if somebody says that he does not urinate.
You will not believe him. He will say it is his religion not to urinate.
Nobody will believe him, but everybody believes celibacy.</p><p>There is no celibacy. It has never existed, and all those who have
pretended either became homosexuals or became masturbators. Or, if they
were not courageous enough even to be homosexuals or to masturbate, then
nature has its own way: in their sleep their semen will be released.
They will be having beautiful women in their dreams. Mahatma Gandhi, who
tried his whole life after he had given birth to five sons -- he must
have been forty at that time -- for thirty years he tried to be
celibate. Impossible. He was having wet dreams even at the age of
seventy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LUCKY. NOT MANY SEVENTY-YEAR-OLDS HAVE THAT
SORT OF DREAMS, DO THEY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. If you are repressed, only then can you have them. If you are
enjoying love, you will be spent.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CELIBATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Right now I am celibate, but if my health gets better I am not
going to be celibate. I have never been celibate. I do not do anything
against nature. Right</p><p>now I am celibate not because celibacy has any value, but just
because I am sick. I don't have any energy to make love to a woman and
do all the gymnastics, no. I have enough energy to talk to my people, to
talk to you. If I get healthy again, I promise you, I will not be
celibate.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DON'T PROMISE ME, PROMISE THEM. ALL THESE LADIES ABOUT THE PLACE
TELL ME THAT YOU'RE A GREAT LOVER.</p><p>A: I am!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Many of them must have loved me. I must have loved them. Q: DOES
THAT MEAN YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH THEM?</p><p>A: Certainly. How do you love if you don't have sex with them? Q: HOW
DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR SEXUAL PARTNERS?</p><p>A: No question, because I don't have any contract, any relationship,
anything similar to marriage. No, just for the moment, in the
moment.</p><p>Traveling in a train I meet a stranger... I don't ask even the name
of the woman, because we may never meet again. What is the point? But if
she is willing. And</p><p>I am really the Blessed One: I don't know why, but women are always
willing. I have never come across a woman who was not willing. If I was
not willing, that is another matter -- but if I was willing, then I have
never come across a woman in my life who was not willing.</p><p>And there was no question of any promise that, "I will love you
forever, forever." There is no problem. It is just a momentous,
momentary affair. We share this moment, we enjoy this moment. And
perhaps at the next station I will be gone, or she will be gone and we
may never see each other again. I have not seen again many women with
whom I had a beautiful moment of love.</p><p>But there are many women here in my commune, and that proves a very
fundamental thing: that although I have loved so many women they are not
jealous of each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU EVER COME CLOSE TO GETTING MARRIED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, never. I have been against marriage from the very beginning,
because that means cutting down your freedom. Getting attached legally
to a woman or to a man, no. Freedom to me is the ultimate value There is
nothing higher than freedom.</p><p>It was difficult, because I was fighting from the very beginning. My
parents were in difficulty, my family was in difficulty, but I told them
absolutely clearly that I was not going to be married. They would have
been perfectly happy if I had been going to be a celibate monk. I said,
"No, I am not going to be a celibate monk either."</p><p>That was their trouble: if I was going to be a celibate monk they
would be happy. In fact, they would have felt proud that their son had
become a great monk. I said, "No, both are ditches. I am going to walk
just in the middle, on the razor's edge." And I have enjoyed the walk
tremendously.</p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURES FROM THE SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVED? --
NOT JUST YOUR PARENTS -- BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE DAYS INDIAN
SOCIETY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CLOSE AND WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT
YOU DID ONE OF TWO THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am intelligent enough for that society.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY NOW TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE
MARRIED? SHOULD THEY ALL GET DIVORCED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Everybody should get divorced, without exception. People should
meet and love each other occasionally, as opportunity comes. There
should be no ugly state when a wife has to make love to a man whom she
does not love anymore, but she has to fulfill her duty. The husband is
fulfilling his duty. While he is making love to the woman he may be
thinking of some other woman, she may be thinking of some other man.
What kind of neurotic society have you created? If you don't love each
other, at least be human and say frankly that it was beautiful to be
together, but now it is finished. Say goodbye.</p><p>I would like marriage to disappear completely from the world, and
with marriage, divorce will disappear. With marriage, prostitution will
disappear. With marriage, most of the work of the priest will disappear.
With marriage, almost ninety-nine percent of the psychoanalysts,
therapists, psychiatrists will disappear. It is marriage that is
creating all kinds of psychological perversions, repressions, guilt.</p><p>It is simply human that you see a beautiful woman and you would like
to have some time with her. It does not need any God's permission. Even
your God committed rape with the Virgin Mary without her consent.</p><p>Q: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY?</p><p>A: I just believe that story because it proves that your God is a
rapist; otherwise, I don't believe in the story. Jesus must be a
bastard. It is certain he was not the son</p><p>of Joseph, and just to cover up the whole thing, that great story has
been invented.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: GOT GOD TO DO THE JOB!</p><p><br></p><p>A: They say God is a trinity: God, the Holy Ghost and the son. The
Holy Ghost did it, but he is part of God. It is just like my hand is
part of me and your genitals are part of you, the Holy Ghost is part af
God. Perhaps he is his genitals. Otherwise, how could he manage to make
a virgin girl pregnant?</p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, THE MARRIED PARTNERS'
RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR CHILDREN, FOR A START?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Children should be the responsibility of the commune, not of the
family. It is the family which creates tremendous problems in the
children's minds. It gives them all their sickness, all their
superstitions, all their stupid ideas, theologies, religion, political
parties. It enforces on the child. The child has to be freed from the
family. If you want a new man... then the family is an ugly institution,
its time is over. It should be replaced by the commune. And then it is
very easy: the commune takes care of all the children.</p><p>There will be the father, the mother. They can meet the child, the
child can come to them. But basically it is the responsibility of the
commune to take care of the children. The children will have many uncles
and many aunts, and they will have more opportunity for human contact
with different types of people. They will be immensely enriched.</p><p>Our children are very impoverished. They know only one man, one
woman, and they know the constant quarrel between the two. The woman is
nagging the husband, the husband is beating the woman. And this is what
you are training them for. Your boy will repeat you. He will be your
carbon copy, knowingly or unknowingly. Your daughter will repeat your
wife, knowingly... unknowingly. That's why no son can ever forgive his
father, and no daughter can ever forgive her mother. They destroyed
their lives. It is absolutely a psychologically proved phenomenon.</p><p>But if the commune takes care, then they will have experiences of so
many different kinds of people. It is my experience that every person is
so unique that the more contacts, intimacies, love affairs you have, the
richer you will be. I have not seen two women who are similar. Making
love to many women, I have seen every woman is a unique personality in
herself, her way of making love is totally different. The people who
have never known anyone except their wives are really poor. They don't
know how many nuances, how many fragrances, how many different ecstasies
are possible through love.</p><p>The same is true about children. They should be available to the
whole commune. And because the commune is responsible, you need not be
afraid</p><p>what will happen to the children if you separate. You can separate.
Nothing will happen to the children, the children will be the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU RELATE THAT TO A WESTERN SOCIETY WHERE MOST PEOPLE LIVE
AS AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY IN EACH HOME, NOT IN A COMMUNE? WHAT SHOULD
HAPPEN THERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It can be immediately transformed into a commune. There is no
problem. Just understanding is needed. A whole big building which has
ten thousand people living in it can become a commune. It is a question
of understanding, there is no problem in it. Now there are skyscraper
buildings -- each building can be a commune.</p><p>Q: AND A STREET ROW OF HOUSES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, they can also become communes. We are making communes all
over the world; purchasing properties, different houses, making one
commune. Sometimes we have difficulty getting all the houses in one
place. No difficulty then, either. We have one main house, the meeting
house, and the commune people live in different places.</p><p>But they have dropped the idea of the family. It is not a question of
arrangements. Arrangements can be made very easily The question is of
understanding. Our mind is created by the family, so it is very
difficult to think that there should be no family. But the family is the
basic unit of the nation. Unless the family disappears, the nation
cannot disappear. The family is the basic unit of the church, so I am
cutting at the very root.</p><p>Q: YOU SURE ARE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: If the family disappears, then nations cannot exist anymore.
Churches and their congregations will simply disappear from the
world.</p><p>We need individuals. I respect the individual the most. The
individual should be able to have as many experiences about everything
as he is capable of, so that all his potential becomes actual.</p><p>Right now the situation is really sad. Even our geniuses like Albert
Einstein use only fifteen percent of their potential. What a poor world
we are creating. If an Albert Einstein uses only fifteen percent of his
potential, then what about the ordinary people? -- perhaps three
percent, four percent, at the most five percent... and you will call
these people talented. Beyond five percent you will call them geniuses.
I am not ready for this retarded world.</p><p>Q: YOU TALKED BEFORE ABOUT WOMEN AS SEXUAL PARTNERS AND AS LOVERS,
BUT YOU SEE THEM AS A LOT MORE THAN THAT. IN FACT,</p><p>LOOKING AROUND HERE, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IT'S THE WOMEN WHO ARE
RUNNING THE PLACE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, that is true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Man has been running the whole society for thousands of years, and
he has proved absolutely impotent to run the society in the right
direction. Give the chance to the woman now.</p><p>My commune is running far better than any society which is dominated
by male chauvinists. It is running perfectly beautifully. There is no
problem. All my communes around the world are run by women. Man has
proved his incapacity. He has tried hard enough to repress women, to
keep them uneducated, to keep them economically dependent, to keep them
almost like cattle, so that he can prove he is very superior. But the
basic phenomenon is that man feels inferior to a woman because he cannot
give birth to a child. The woman can give birth to a child; man's
function in giving birth is only that of an injection.</p><p>The woman has the capacity to give birth to children. That creates a
deep sense of inferiority complex in man. To cover it up he started
repressing woman, cutting her talents, telling her that she is not
capable of anything, that she is only capable of doing the jobs of
cooking, taking care of the children, washing the floor; of more than
that she is not capable. Only man is capable of all the great
things.</p><p>All religions are founded by man, and all religions have condemned
women. Jainism, one of the most ancient religions in India, says that
from the body of a woman nobody can be liberated, nobody can become
enlightened. From the female body, nobody can grow into consciousness.
Strange. The same people go on teaching that body and soul are separate,
and the soul is neither male nor female, and that growth happens in the
soul, and that liberation is of the soul, not of the body. Then why
can't women enter into paradise?</p><p>No, they have to be put down in every possible way. First, they
should practice religious disciplines so that they are born in a man's
body in their next life. All that they can do right now is pray,
meditate, fast, to get into a man's body in the next life. Then there is
a possibility. From the female body there is no possibility. In India
they were not allowed to read religious scriptures.</p><p>Jesus had twelve apostles, twelve idiots around him, who could not do
anything to save the man. They all knew that the next day he was going
to be crucified, they all knew that he was going to be caught that
night, and not a single one of them was courageous enough to tell Jesus
that going to Jerusalem was suicidal. There was no need. Why should they
go there? It was not the right time. He would be crucified.</p><p>Not a single woman was Jesus' apostle. But when he was crucified all
the men had escaped. Only three women were there under the cross: his
mother, Mary; his lover perhaps, Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute;
and another woman called Martha. All the apostles had disappeared.</p><p>Men have been telling women that they weak, which is medically wrong.
Women live longer than men, five years longer. Women suffer less from
diseases than men. Women go mad half as often as men. Women commit
suicide half as often as men. Still, the woman is weak, and she has to
be kept cut off from every corner so she cannot grow. And half the
society consists of women. They give birth to your children.</p><p>What you are doing to the woman you are also doing to your children,
because they will be taking care of the children; the children will be
learning from and imitating the woman. That's why every language is
called mother tongue. Even Germans don't have the guts to call their
language father tongue.</p><p>Q: SO WHEN YOU GO, WHEN YOU DIE, WILL A WOMAN BECOME THE LEADER OF
THE RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't care. I don't care at all. I am a man who is not concerned
with past or future.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU CARE FOR THE FUTURE OF RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I care in this moment. It is not caring about their future. In
this moment I care. What happens tommorrow I have nothing to do with.
But in this moment, whatsoever response arises in me I have to share
with my people.</p><p>Q: HAVE YOU MET A WOMAN WHO COULD DO THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING AS
WELL?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is very difficult to say. Because unless the opportunity is
given, one never knows what a woman can do, what a man can do. It is
always the opportunity. While I am here it is difficult for any woman to
do what I am doing. Once I am gone, perhaps a woman can do it better
than a man. Perhaps she may do even better than me. After all,
unfortunately, I belong to the male race.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN A WOMAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, because I love women so much. I would not be able to love men,
that would be the difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL? WHY ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS THE LEADER?
YOU TELL PEOPLE THINGS, AND THEY FOLLOW WHAT YOU</p><p>SAY, BUT WHY YOU? WHY NOT SOMEBODY ELSE? WHY NOT NOBODY? COULD THESE
PEOPLE NOT JUST FOLLOW YOUR PHILOSOPHIES WITHOUT YOU TELLING THEM?</p><p>A: You ask them -- because I am not their leader. I have not told
them that they are my followers. I have not asked them to come and be
here with me. It is their business and their problem, and their
responsibility. I am a very irresponsible person. I don't take anybody
else's responsibility. It is enough that I take my own
responsibility.</p><p>You will have to ask my people why.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT THEY FOLLOW YOU THE WAY THEY DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It surprises me immensely. It is really a miracle. I am nobody's
leader, but there are half a million people who think they are my
followers.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU ENJOY THE ADORATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Not at all. I hate it. I enjoy friendship. Adoration is
putting somebody high above you. I don't have any ego. I am not higher
than anybody else, not holier than anybody else.</p><p>But it certainly surprises me. They adore... they must be crazy! Now
what can I do about it? You tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I'D JUST GO ALONG WITH IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR ROLLS ROYCES AND I'M NOT GOING
TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR HALF-MILLION-DOLLAR WATCH, BUT I KNOW THAT ANY
FASHION-CONSCIOUS PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, WHO'VE SEEN YOU WOULD SAY,
"WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE MAGNIFICENT CLOTHES FROM?"</p><p>A: My women make them. They love to see me in fabulous clothes. Q:
ARE YOU FASHION CONSCIOUS?</p><p>A: I love everything that is beautiful. I will not say I am fashion
conscious, because my robe is not a fashion.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL I'VE GOT A FEELING YOU MIGHT BE GOING TO START A NEW
FASHION.</p><p>A: That is possible. I love everything that is beautiful, but I am
not fashion conscious, otherwise I would be imitating somebody else who
is fashionable. My people design my clothes. They enjoy, and they know
that I love only the best of everything. So they do it, and try their
best. And I am perfectly contented with my people. In fact, I adore
them. Nobody has been so fortunate as I am.</p><p>Jesus certainly was surrounded by fools. Buddha had not the guts to
allow women to enter into his commune. For almost twenty years he
continuously refused to initiate a woman. What was the fear? And when he
was asked why, he said, "If I allow women into the commune, then my
religion will last only five hundred years. If I don't allow women into
my commune, my religion will last for five thousand years."</p><p>But why this desire that the religion should last for five thousand
years? This seems to be only greed, immense greed, to keep your firm
running for five thousand years. What is the point? And why are you
afraid that if you allow women entry, your religion will be gone within
five hundred years? The fear is every man's fear.</p><p>Man feels deep down that he is inferior; the woman is superior. She
is beautiful. The man tries also to imitate. For what reason does he
shave his mustache, his beard? Just think of a woman growing a beard and
mustache -- do you think she will look very beautiful?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SHE'D BE IN THE CIRCUS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. And that is the situation about the men who have cut their
beards and mustaches. They are in the circus.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU'VE RAISED A LOT OF CONSCIOUSNESS, I KNOW. I CAN
PREDICT THAT ALREADY FROM WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE. ARE YOU SERIOUS
ABOUT IT ALL, OR IS IT ALL JUST ONE BIG JOKE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not serious at all. It is all a big joke. Seriousness is not my
business at all. I am an absolutely nonserious person, enjoying the
small things of life, unconcerned about the next moment.</p><p>I have lived my whole life this way and I don't repent. I don't feel
that I have missed anything.</p><p>Q: PERHAPS A FINAL MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA ABOUT
YOU, ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE, AND
PERHAPS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEE FROM YOU? DO YOU HAVE ONE? THEY'RE ALL
WAITING.</p><p>A: Nothing can be said about the future, but they will see some great
circus, certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SOON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO APPEAR ON THE PROGRAM.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was glad to talk to you. Q: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.</p><p>A: Come again and again whenever you can. And tell the people there
that I am coming.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-6>The Last Testament, Vol 1

title: It Is Up To You 23 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove</h1><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament,
Volume 1, as Chapter 16.]</p><p>Ma Yoga Pratima BHAGWAN MAGAZINE, RAJNEESHPURAM, OREGON</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BELOVED BHAGWAN, ON BEHALF OF ALL THE SANNYASINS I WANT TO
THANK YOU THAT YOU ARE SHOWING US EVERY DIMENSION OF YOUR BEING -- SO
CASUALLY, SO MATTER-OF-FACT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT TO ASK AS A
DISCIPLE MYSELF AND AS A REPORTER WHO COMMUNICATES IT TO FELLOW
SANNYASINS, IS: HOW, IN WHAT WAYS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US BECOME AS
ORDINARY AS YOU ARE?</p><p>ANSWER: One never becomes ordinary. You can become extraordinary. The
very process of becoming leads you away from being ordinary. So there is
no how as far as being ordinary is concerned. You are ordinary. You
don't have to become. You have to drop becoming, you have to start
living. These are the two types of people in the world: those who are
continuously becoming and in their very effort of becoming this and
that, they are losing being what they are. They are losing time, life,
energy, and their becoming is never going to end.</p><p>It is just like the horizon there, appearing so close that you can
reach it -- just a few more miles to go. But as you reach the few miles,
you find the horizon has receded again, the distance remains always the
same. The person who is caught in the net of becoming wastes his whole
life, dies unfulfilled, in tremendous despair, because he can see that
the whole life was there for him to live, but because of his desire to
become something, someone, he sacrificed all that was freely available
to him.</p><p>One does not become ordinary. You are ordinary. You are born
ordinary, just like everything else in existence: animals, birds, trees.
No bird needs to be ordinary. No tree asks, inquires how to be ordinary.
But man asks it. And this very process of becoming makes you insane.</p><p>Drop becoming anybody else. Drop the very idea that you have to be
according to some discipline, some scripture, some theology. Forget
completely that you have to be like Jesus or Buddha or Mahavira, and
suddenly you will find you are</p><p>who you are. Live it joyously, without any guilt. Existence wanted
you to be what you are. If existence wanted another Jesus he would have
created thousands of Jesuses, there is no problem. He would have made
Jesuses on an assembly line. But he makes only individuals. Existence
never duplicates, never makes anybody similar to somebody else.</p><p>This is the beauty and the glory of existence. This is a blessing,
that nobody like you has ever existed and will ever exist again. You are
simply unique. Don't waste this uniqueness in running after some goal,
some shadow.</p><p>Now, because I am telling you it is so beautiful to be ordinary, it
is so joyous to be ordinary, you have made being ordinary also a goal.
Your question would have been perfectly right if you had asked how to
become a Jesus Christ, how to become a Buddha, how to become a great
celebrity.</p><p>But the very processes of becoming and being ordinary are absolutely
diametrically opposite to each other. You are where you are trying to
reach. There is nowhere to go. You have not to become anybody. This very
moment you are what existence wanted you to be. Don't miss it. Enjoy it.
All the religions have deceived humanity and created the idea of
becoming in the mind of man. Once you get caught in the idea of
becoming, then there is only misery, suffering, anxiety, anguish,
despair, defeat, death.</p><p>That's what has been happening to millions of people for thousands of
years. Everybody was trying to become something. You cannot go against
nature. You cannot in any way be anything other than what you are. The
very effort of becoming something, someone, is absurd. But how have the
religions managed to make this whole earth a madhouse? They gave you
goals, they gave you great ideals you have to fulfill. It is impossible.
By the sheer nature of things, it is impossible. But because it is
impossible, far away, it becomes a challenge to your ego. The impossible
has a tremendous attraction, but you are forgetting that it is
impossible. It may have tremendous attraction because of its
impossibility, but you are going to be a failure finally.</p><p>There are so many people who realize that they were alive only when
they die. When they were alive they were so busy with so many things,
they completely forgot about life. They remembered it only when they
knew that only a few breaths are left -- the heart is sinking, only a
few beats more -- that is the moment the realization occurs to them,
"What a fool I have been. The whole life has simply passed by my side. I
have not drunk from its wine, I have not eaten its fruits, I am not even
acquainted with its fragrance. What was it? And now it is too late."</p><p>That's why I say only the ordinary being is capable of rejoicing,
because his energy is not involved in any process of becoming. It is all
available, it is overflowing. What can you do with overflowing energy?
Sing, dance, rejoice.</p><p>My insistence for ordinariness has tremendous implications you may
not be aware of. By telling you to be just ordinary, I am making you
free from all strategies of religions, theologies, political ideologies.
I am cutting their very</p><p>root, even without mentioning it. If you are ready to be ordinary,
nobody can exploit you. Nobody can push you in a direction which is not
for you. Nobody can create a guilt in you. Nobody can say that something
is wrong in you. I am making you free from all kinds of parasites.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world they have been using the same methodology just to
make you feel guilty. What you eat is wrong, how you live is wrong, how
you sit is wrong, how you walk is wrong. They have not left anything for
you to decide for yourself. Somebody else -- Manu, five thousand years
ago -- has decided for Hindus how they should be, and for five thousand
years Hindus have been imprisoned by that man Manu. And it is so
stupid.</p><p>You just be what you are... no becoming. Being is my message. Up to
now becoming has been the message of everybody. Being is my message.
Becoming has created guilt, sadness, despair, because you cannot do it.
On each step you fall, and on each step you realize how poor, how
inferior, how powerless you are. On each step you are forced to
recognize that you are unintelligent, stupid; otherwise, why are you not
succeeding?</p><p>You are not stupid, you are not unintelligent, you are not powerless.
You are just trying to do something which simply cannot be done.</p><p>Have you seen sometimes a dog trying to catch his tail? A dog is
sitting, is in a thinking mood, contemplating; he sees the tail, becomes
curious: "What is this?" Naturally, if human beings are doing such
stupid things, you cannot expect a dog not to do a stupid thing. He
tries to catch hold of the tail that is lying there, but as he tries,
the tail moves away. He tries harder -- that is logical -- he jumps with
as much force as possible, but he is simply amazed that the tail also
jumps in the same proportion and the distance remains the same. But I
think dogs are not so idiotic. After a few efforts he realizes that this
is not possible. He drops the idea, forgets about the tail. It is his
own tail, there is no problem. But man goes on and on, chasing
something, a shadow.</p><p>No, don't make ordinariness a goal somewhere away from you, so that a
path is needed, a discipline is needed; so that you have to follow a
leader, you have to listen to a priest, you have to change your habits,
you have to fit with the goal. Nobody in the whole history has ever
succeeded in becoming anybody else. And it is good that everybody has
failed, because even if one man had succeeded, he would have proved all
the religions right. One exception would have been enough. If one can
succeed, then why not others? History totally supports me. Without
exception, everybody has failed-except those few rare people who have
never tried to become anybody, who simply lived ordinarily without any
plan, without any tomorrow, without any ideals, without any philosophy,
who have simply lived.</p><p>Living is my religion. Living herenow, and living as you are without
any conditions, without any qualification, that's my message.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHY DO RAJNEESHEES, WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD, INTO
THE COURTS, ALREADY FEEL AS IF THEY ARE GUILTY? WHY DOESN'T OUR
CONVICTION COME OUT? WHY AREN'T WE PROUD OF OURSELVES? WHY DO WE BEHAVE
LIKE SUCH WIMPS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For the simple reason that you are not yet what I am trying to get
you to understand. When you go out, you try to prove you are somebody
special. You try to prove that you are no ordinary human beings. You are
somebody chosen, you have a message, you have a special way of life. You
have certain understanding which everybody else is lacking. Naturally
you will feel in difficulty because they are in the majority and you are
alone.</p><p>Here in the commune you can rejoice in being special, because
everybody is rejoicing in being special, there is no problem. And nobody
cares what anybody thinks, nobody is trying to impress anybody. In the
commune you are living simply. There you become tense, tight, afraid of
public opinion; you want to prove in the public's eyes that you are a
superior being to them, which you cannot prove. Nobody is superior or
inferior. There is no question of comparison. And the very tension,
tightness, anxiety makes you feel guilty, as if you have betrayed me, as
if you have not been the way you were expected to be.</p><p>I have no expectations of you. Go to the courts, to the marketplace,
anywhere, but remain ordinary, with no attitude of holier than thou. And
you will be surprised: there is no tension, there is no anxiety, there
is no guilt. And your intelligence will function more efficiently
because you will be so relaxed.</p><p>It is a miracle to know the beauty and the power of being relaxed.
Suddenly your intelligence has a sharpness that you were not aware of
Your capacities come to their very peak. You function not just on the
minimum survival level, but on the maximum. Your torch of life burns
from both ends together.</p><p>It is a strange thing. You were trying to be special and you felt
guilty. You were trying to prove yourself holier, higher, and you were
feeling a failure. Now you are not trying to be higher, and you are. You
are not trying to be better than anybody else, but you are, because they
are not relaxed and you are relaxed. And that small difference makes
such a great difference that it is immeasurable.</p><p>In my whole life I never felt guilty about anything. I don't have any
idea how you feel guilty. What kind of thing is guilt? Intellectually I
understand, but existentially I have never experienced it, for the
simple reason that I have never tried to be anything other than I
was.</p><p>I have been in the courts and I have enjoyed it. In fact, the judges
became tense, the advocates became tense, my own advocate became nervous
about what I was saying, what I was doing. The whole court was full of
tension. I could not understand what was the matter. I should have been
tense. Why were they in such anxiety? The case was against me, I was
ready to face it, because I didn't see there was any crime.…</p><p>There was one church, specially for British people, which had been
closed for many years, because when the British rule ended in India, all
the foreigners moved out. The archbishop of England -- thousands of
miles away -- was the owner of that church in Jabalpur.</p><p>I had a few Christian friends. I said to them "This beautiful church
always remains closed." They said, "The congregation of that church is
no more here, the nearest authority is in the capital, Nagpur. The
bishop of Nagpur is the nearest authority who has the keys. But the real
authority is with the archbishop of England."</p><p>I said, "You are just fools. Break the lock -- it is already falling
apart since ten years. Clean the church. This is your church. Use
it."</p><p>They became excited, the idea was good. The church was a beautiful
building with a very big garden around it, but it had become a jungle,
nobody was taking any care. They broke the lock. They asked me to
inaugurate the opening. I said, "I am perfectly ready" and so I
inaugurated their church.</p><p>It took a few days for the bishop of Nagpur to understand what was
happening there. Then he inquired of the archbishop of England what to
do, "because a few Christians have broken the lock, entered the
property, and are worshipping every Sunday there." Of course the
archbishop was angry and he told him, "Take legal action against
them."</p><p>The legal action was taken against them. That's why I was also found
guilty. I inaugurated it, I inspired those people to enter into the
church, so I was the most responsible person. I said to the judge, "A
church, a temple, a mosque, a synagogue belongs to those who worship
there. It is no ordinary property. For ten years the church has remained
without a single worshipper. The archbishop of England is guilty for
that, the bishop of Nagpur is guilty for that. Who are they to lock a
church and prevent worshippers?</p><p>"I am not a Christian, but I can see that a beautiful place which was
meant for worshipping, for prayer, is lying empty. Jesus Christ is still
hanging on the cross and nobody comes. He must be getting bored."</p><p>I said, "Yes, I inspired these people to make that church again
alive. It is dying. And to make any church alive is not a crime. To keep
it locked... locked against whom? In fact, churches and temples should
not have doors, so that they are available twenty-four hours for anybody
to meditate there. It is a place of silence."</p><p>My advocate was getting to the point of nervous breakdown when I said
that the archbishop of England should be given an arrest warrant... and
these people were going to continue worshipping in the church. The judge
said, "Whatever you are saying is absolutely right, but it is not legal.
The church is a property owned by the Church of England. Entering into
somebody else's property, taking possession of it, using it, is
trespass."</p><p>I said, "Then I am ready to be punished, to be jailed. But remember,
you are doing something absolutely wrong. You are not making any
difference between</p><p>a place of worship and an ordinary house. A place of worship cannot
be owned by anybody, cannot be possessed by anybody. It belongs to those
who are ready to worship there. Tell the archbishops of Nagpur and
England that either they should come here and bring their congregation,
so the church becomes alive, or... why are they worried? They were happy
for ten years. The church was gathering dust, it was going to become a
ruin.</p><p>"And I am not a Christian at all. I have no concern with that church,
just a human concern, a compassion. These people I know, and I told
them, 'If you are ready to worship, the church is yours.' And I take the
whole responsibility on myself, these people are not in any way
responsible. They simply got inspired by me." There was silence. The
advocate sent by the bishop of Nagpur could not figure out what to say.
The judge told me that it was legally wrong, but spiritually right: "I
cannot give any punishment to you. But please don't do anything like
that again."</p><p>I said, "That I cannot agree with. I will continue my whole life
doing things like that, because I don't care about man-made laws. My
concern is with the existential, with the spiritual, with the real.
Man-made laws go on changing."</p><p>But those Christians who had agreed and opened the church became
afraid. The bishop of Nagpur put another big lock. I lived in Jabalpur
for twenty years, and by the time I left Jabalpur the church was in
ruins, the roof had fallen. This is according to the law.</p><p>Why should I be afraid or guilty? And I am ready to accept any
consequences of my actions. I have been moving for thirty years in the
country facing hostile masses -- sometimes fifty thousand people, all
hostile. But I have never felt any guilt, because whatever I was doing,
I was doing with my totality. And whatever I was doing, I was doing with
full consciousness. And seeing me, listening to me, although they had
come with aggressive prejudices, I could see slowly, slowly a calmness
was descending on them. And by the end, when I left, many were in
tears.</p><p>In Ahmedabad a man came just after I had finished the meeting, fell
at my feet and said, "Forgive me." I said, "But you have not done
anything to me, why should I forgive you?" He said, "I have not done
what I had come to do," and he showed me a big knife that he was
carrying. He said, "I had come to kill you because I had been told that
you are against religion, and I am a great devotee of Krishna." He was a
fanatic Hindu.</p><p>I said, "Then why don't you kill me?" He said, "Listening to you I
became aware that what you are saying is religion. You are not against
religion, you are against religions. Those religions I have followed up
to now, but I want to change. I had come to kill you, but you have
killed me!" And that man is a sannyasin since then and has been a very
stable, reliable sannyasin.</p><p>Just go simply anywhere as you are and present yourself openly. We
don't have any secrets; only guilty people have secrets. Only people who
are burdened with</p><p>the idea of sin have secrets. We don't have any secrets. We don't
have any theology, so nobody can contradict you.</p><p>There is a saying that man proposes and God disposes. What I am doing
here is: I have disposed of God and I am asking you not to propose
anything. So both parts of the proverb, "Man proposes.…" Why? Why should
you propose? Proposals can be contradicted, better proposals can be
produced. There is no need to propose anything. Live whatsoever you feel
is right. And it is your life, nobody else's business to interfere. God
I have disposed of completely. And if you don't propose, even if God is
there, how can he dispose it?</p><p>I am making a very strange and unique effort with you. Buddha was
making people special, holier, higher than the layman. The layman was
almost a word of condemnation. The bhikku, the sannyasin, was truly a
man. The layman was not worth anything. Now, he was creating a class,
helping their egos to become stronger and stronger.</p><p>And these are the methods to make your ego stronger: Do things which
are against nature. Do things which other people find very difficult to
do. Fast, and then people will respect you. They cannot fast for seven
days, and you have fasted for twenty-one days. You have done something
superhuman. They cannot drop even one breakfast; they cannot live
without eating for just a single day. But whatever you have done is
against nature. You have tortured yourself, but it will give you a very
sophisticated ego. So do things which are not natural: be celibate,
which is not natural. Don't enjoy anything, because every enjoyment iS
condemned.</p><p>Jainas, Buddhists, Hindus have five great principles of life which
can make a man a superman. The first of those five is aswad. The word
means tastelessness. Drop all taste. They are asking of you something
absolutely unnatural: don't enjoy your food, don't enjoy eating
anything, or, before eating it, destroy its tastefulness.</p><p>The Hindu monk begs from houses and then goes to the river, mixes all
kinds of food into his begging bowl, gives the begging bowl a dip in the
river, so whatsoever is left unmixed, the water does it, and then eats
it. Now, in that begging bowl was every kind of thing -- salty, with
sugar, sweets. They have all lost their taste. Now it is religious.
People will worship you because you have conquered taste. All you have
done is destroy a sensitivity that is part of your individuality.</p><p>Islam is against music. Strange: "Don't enjoy music." Someone is
against the tongue, another is against the ear. And there are
Mohammedans who have never listened to any music. Then why not become
deaf? Why not give your tongue plastic surgery? Remove those small buds
on your tongue which taste things -- which is so much easier and so
scientific -- rather than the whole life suffering. And because these
things are unnatural, you are never absolutely successful. Hence the
guilt arises and hypocrisy, because you have to go on pretending that
you have succeeded.</p><p>I have been very friendly with a few Jaina monks and nuns. They had
become very intimate and were almost ready to drop their monkhood. Then
I came to know about a few things which no Jaina knows. These monks are
not supposed to enjoy taste, but I found that in the temple where they
were staying, they were keeping Coca-Cola, Fanta, hidden behind the
statue of God, Mahavira. And because I was very intimate and they
trusted me, they offered me their Coca- Cola. And I said, "Great, but
how do you manage?" They said, "A few laymen love us so much that
whatsoever we say, they manage." They all had small transistor radios;
no Jaina can suspect their monks are carrying transistor radios,
listening to all kinds of film music.</p><p>Whenever you ask people to fulfill unnatural things, you are asking
for them to be guilty. So on the one hand they are creating a big ego,
the ego becomes bigger, becomes a mountain; and on the other hand, side
by side, a deep valley of guilt. The bigger the mountain, the bigger the
valley.</p><p>I want you to be just walking on the earth. There is no need to go to
Everest. I don't want you to be anybody special. Your dress is not to
make you special; on the contrary, it is to remind you that you are an
ordinary human being. Behave with that ordinariness and you will be
surprised that you are received and welcomed. Your ordinariness will
destroy the hostility in the other person. Just go into the whole world.
It is ours; why should we feel anxiety and tension in any way? By making
you realize your ordinariness, I am giving you the whole kingdom of God
here on the earth, and only an ordinary person can enjoy the kingdom of
God.</p><p>Try. And when I say try, I don't mean make effort. I mean give it a
chance the way I am saying. Give it a chance, and something will
trigger.</p><p>I was in the university, a student of philosophy, and I was never in
agreement with my professors because they were all outdated. They had
studied in the universities twenty, thirty years before. In these thirty
years the whole world of philosophy had changed. They had read Bradley,
Bosake, Kant, Feuerbach, but they had not heard about Wittgenstein,
Jean-Paul Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger. I was ahead of them, so there was
continuous argument. And because I was ahead of them, they were always
in trouble. They had never conceived that Kant can be criticized, that
Bradley can be criticized. And after they left the university they had
never touched another book of philosophy.</p><p>So it was an everyday trouble. I would not agree with their
arguments, their arguments were so poor, and they were continuously in a
nervous breakdown because the whole class was with me, and nobody was
ready to agree with them. One of my professors, finding it almost
impossible to manage me, one day invited the vice-chancellor, the head
of the department, the assistant head of the department and all other
professors of the department, almost eight persons. As I entered the
class I could not believe what was the matter, because in my class there
were only three students: two girls and me. What were the
vice-chancellor, head of the department and other professors doing
there?</p><p>And the professor said, "Now I am going to teach, and you, before all
these people, bring your arguments." He was thinking that I would become
nervous. The vice-chancellor was there, the greatest authority in the
university. The head of the department was there, who could make or mar
my whole future. All the other professors were there. Anybody in my
place would have collapsed. His mind would have gone berserk, he would
not have been able to argue.</p><p>But I got so ecstatic that first I thanked the vice-chancellor, the
head of the department and the other professors. I said, 'I was waiting
for this opportunity to show you what kind of professors you have. This
man must have been dead thirty years ago. In thirty years' time
philosophy has taken such quantum leaps he is not aware of. He does not
know even the names of the latest philosophical minds, developments. I
am grateful that he has gathered you; in fact I was going to invite you
all one day, but I am lazy. So I waited for some day, but he has done my
job. I am thankful to him also." And I told him, "You start."</p><p>He was teaching Gautam Buddha at that time and he said, continuing,
that the country in Gautam Buddha's time was so moral, so religious, so
spiritual, that there was no crime, no theft, no murder. In fact, people
never used locks on their houses. Even if they were going for months,
their houses remained unlocked, because it was unheard of that anybody
would steal. That's what Buddhist scriptures say. He asked me, "Now what
do you have to say?"</p><p>I said, "They had no locks on their doors for two simple reasons: for
the first, there were no locks invented. You will have to give me proof
that locks existed. Otherwise, how do you suppose poor people locked
their houses? You will have to give evidence that there were locks in
existence. Secondly, I say to you that the people were so poor, they had
nothing in their houses. Even if locks existed, they would not have been
able to purchase them. And for what? -- there was nothing in the house
to be stolen." And he turned to the vice-chancellor and said, "You see,
this is how the whole year goes by. Now what am I supposed to do?"</p><p>I said, "You are not supposed to do anything, just listen to me a
little more and withdraw whatever you have said. If it is true that
people were rich and there was nobody who was poor, then why does Buddha
continuously teach to help the poor, serve the poor? Why does he make it
a great virtue? If there were no poor people, whom are you going to
serve? He continuously preached for forty- two years.</p><p>"I can bring all the scriptures tomorrow," I said, "and put them
before you. Every day for forty-two years he was teaching that stealing
is a great sin, never steal. If there were no thieves and everybody was
a spiritual saint, who was he talking about, who was he addressing?
Where could he get every day for forty-two years people he had to teach,
'Don't steal, don't be violent, don't be jealous, don't be this, that'?
It certainly proves people were stealing, people were thieves, people
were lying. That's why he goes on insisting, 'Don't lie, speak the
truth.' What more evidence do you want?"</p><p>The professor was absolutely dumb. The vice-chancellor stood up and
said to the professor, "It will be good for you to learn from that
student. And if you don't have any argument, then accept his argument.
It does not matter who is arguing, whether he is a professor or a
student; the question is whose argument is closer to the truth."</p><p>The vice-chancellor was a retired chief justice of the high court. I
thanked him. I said, "I was expecting fairness and I am happy that you
have not been unfair. You have not supported the wrong side just because
he is a professor. You have supported a student."</p><p>In my whole life I have never found there is any problem, any need to
be nervous, to be guilty, to be tense. But people are. Everybody is, not
only you. Perhaps you will feel it more because you can immediately be
distinguished by your dress, by your mala. You can immediately be
distinguished, and you are standing against a thick wall of
prejudice.</p><p>But remember: truth may be very small, but its power is almost like
an atomic explosion. And howsoever big the lie may be, almost as big as
God himself -- God is the lie -- a small truth is capable to expose the
greatest lie.</p><p>I don't say you need conviction, because that is a wrong word here. A
Christian needs conviction, because he does not know. Don't make
conviction a problem at all. Just say whatsoever you know, and just be
whatsoever you are. Don't pretend to be bigger than yourself. Don't
pretend to know that which you don't know.</p><p>Always be ready to say, "I do not know this." There is no guilt in it
because in fact nobody in the whole history of humanity has been able to
say that he knows everything. There is always a point where he has to
accept and say, "I do not know." So why be afraid? We are ordinary
people. If even Socrates has to say, "I do not know," why can't Pratima
say, "I do not know"? Conviction is not needed. Experience, and don't
pretend beyond your experience, and you will be always at ease and
relaxed.</p><p>Can't you see me? I never think what I am going to say to you,
because one thing is certain with me: if I know, I will answer; if I
don't know, I will say I don't know. What is wrong in not knowing? There
are limitations to everything. If I don't have to say I don't know, it
is because of you. You cannot find the place, the point, the question,
where I will have to say,"I don't know." It is your problem, not my
problem. Seek and search and try to find something that I have to
answer, "I don't know," and I will say it with the same strength as I
say anything that I know. I will not speak out of weakness, I will not
hesitate. I will not be wishy-washy, I will not try to divert the
subject.</p><p>But to ask a question for which I have to say, "I don't know," you
will have to come to the same space where I am. And in that space you
cannot ask. You yourself know that in this space all questions are
futile and no answer is possible. People are afraid of me. Strange: I am
not a Muhammad Ali, and I am not going to do any boxing, so why are they
afraid of me? The journalists have been</p><p>continuously asking me why people are afraid of me. They are afraid
for the simple reason that whatsoever they know, they really don't know.
And coming in front of me, they are going to be exposed. They will be
standing utterly naked, and that is the fear.</p><p>I am not afraid of anybody. What can anybody do to me? At the most
somebody can assassinate me. To me it seems exciting. Death is bound to
happen, and assassination is not a bad way, in fact perfectly suitable
to a man like me. I will enjoy it. I will thank the man; I will not die
before thanking him. And I will ask you that that man not be punished,
because to me he has not given any pain, he has simply given me an
opportunity to move beyond the body. So don't drag him to the court.
Don't force him to be sentenced to death. Make history out of it: be the
first people in the whole history whose Master has been assassinated,
but you are not against the assassination or against the assassin. And
there is every possibility the assassin will become a sannyasin,
otherwise he will not be able to survive.</p><p>Do you know what happened to Judas? He sold Jesus for only thirty
pieces of silver. When Jesus was crucified, he was also expecting a
miracle would happen and God would save him. And meanwhile, just being a
Jew, if he has earned thirty silver pieces, what is wrong in it? Jesus
is not dead; on the contrary, on the cross God fulfills his promise and
Jesus is recognized as the real messiah for whom the Jews have been
waiting for thousands of years.</p><p>So in fact I don't think he was betraying Jesus. He was just being an
authentic Jew. It is all profit: Jesus will be recognized as the
messiah, God will be known by thousands of people -- an opportunity
which is rare -- the ultimate miracle of God descending to save Jesus
will be a proof that God is, that Jesus is God's only begotten son.
There is no problem in it. Judas believed it; and if he can make some
money by the way, it is simply Jewish and human.</p><p>But the miracle did not happen. Nothing descended from the sky. Judas
was hiding in the hills waiting for the miracle. When the miracle did
not happen, Judas committed suicide within twenty-four hours. He felt
that he had done wrong, just for thirty pieces of silver. If he had
really betrayed Jesus, there was no point in his committing suicide. He
felt so full of guilt that he had to punish himself with the same
punishment that poor Jesus got because of him. He hanged himself from a
tree.</p><p>Christians never talk about Judas. He is a man of a certain
character; I don't see anything in him that has to be condemned. He
believed in Jesus, that's why he sold him. His trust was so much that he
thought there was nothing wrong in getting thirty pieces of silver.
Jesus was going to be saved by God. But Jesus was not saved. He must
have thrown those thirty pieces of silver in the mountains and hanged
himself out of sheer guilt: what has he done? As far as I can see his
crucifixion by his own hand is far more significant than Jesus'
crucifixion by others. Judas should be counted among the great names of
world history. He is as valuable as Jesus.</p><p>But why did the guilt come in? It came because he was convinced. It
was not his experience that Jesus was something divine. He had heard
Jesus say that he was God's son, but it was not his experience. These
were words repeated so often that he started believing in them. The
conviction of Judas was greater than the conviction of the other
apostles. But conviction is superficial. It is not that you don't have
conviction, so you feel afraid; no, it is because you have certain
conviction that you feel afraid.</p><p>Do you see my point? I am emphasizing continuously: don't believe in
anybody, particularly in me. Between Jesus and you is a great distance;
Moses even greater. These people are just names to you. But I am not
just a name. I am flesh and bones, and as real as you are. It is
possible that you can start believing in me; then, that belief will
create fear. Facing the hostility of others, your suspicions which you
have repressed by the belief may start asserting. Perhaps, if so many
people -- and the world is large -- are against Bhagwan, then who knows
whether he is right or not? That hesitation will create fear in you,
nervousness in you.</p><p>I have been surprised giving interviews to the journalists, seeing
that they are so nervous. And this must have been their experience
also... because whomsoever they go to interview is usually nervous about
what they are going to ask. They may ask questions which may create
trouble. They may ask questions that if he answers them, he will be
exposed; if he does not answer them, then a great suspicion will arise.
People are very much afraid of journalists, very nervous. With me the
experience has been totally different. And I have told Isabel, "Now find
all the journalists from all over the world, and bring each guy and I am
going to give him a good heart attack. This will be his real experience
of journalism." If I am open, you cannot expose me. If I am utterly
available, if I put all my cards before you on the table, what can you
do? In fact, they become nervous because they start feeling the
truthfulness of what I am saying. They forget that they are here only as
journalists. Their human being is also there in the same search as
everybody else, in search of silence, serenity.</p><p>One journalist was here. His people wanted only a thirty-minute
interview and it went on for two hours. His director was getting very
disturbed, but the man forgot completely that he was only a journalist
and he was to ask only questions in which the ordinary public and the
audience would be interested. He became so involved personally, he
started asking questions which were relevant to his growth. Of course
the director was puzzled about what he was doing. They had prepared all
the questions. He was given the list again and again, and he would hold
the list, and carry on with me.</p><p>You need not be nervous, afraid. And remember, it is not lack of
confidence. It is your belief, conviction, your confidence that you feel
here in the commune, where everybody is supportive of you, nobody is
hostile to you. Outside, you are alone there with hostile people. But
enjoy it. My whole life I have enjoyed facing the hostile public. It is
such a beautiful challenge, and if you have something to</p><p>say, they are going to hear it. They will have to hear it. If you
have something authentic, existential, experiential, their lies will
start dropping from their heads. If you are open to them, soon you will
find they start becoming open to you. It is infectious.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY ARE WE AFRAID, AND SOMETIMES EVEN RESENT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR OURSELVES, AND WE EXPECT EITHER YOU OR THE COMMUNE TO TAKE THE
RESPONSIBILITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is because from your very childhood you have been taught not to
be responsible. You have been taught to depend. You have been taught to
be responsible to your father, to your mother, to your family, to your
motherland, to all kinds of nonsense. But you have not been told that
you have to be responsible for yourself, that there is nobody who is
going to take your responsibility.</p><p>No, on the contrary, your parents were taking your responsibility.
Your family was taking your responsibility. The priest was taking your
responsibility for your spiritual growth. You were just to follow all
these people and do whatsoever they said. When you are grown up and you
are no more a child, a great fear arises because you have to take
responsibility and you have not been trained to take responsibility for
yourself.</p><p>You go to confess your sin to the priest... what kind of stupidity
are you doing? First, to think that you have committed sin; second,
feeling guilty that you committed it; third, now you have to go to the
priest to confess it, so that he can pray to God to forgive you. A
simple thing has become so complex, so unnecessarily long and
circuitous.</p><p>Whatever you have done, you wanted to do it, that's why you have done
it. And who is there to decide what is sin and what is not sin? There is
no criterion anywhere, no weighing scale that you can go and weigh how
much sin you have committed -- one kilo, two kilos, three kilos. How
long a sin have you committed? -- one yard, two yards, three yards? And
what was this sin, and who is this priest you are going to confess
to?</p><p>And this is his strategy: if you go on confessing to the priest, you
are certainly afraid of him, because he knows all the ins and outs about
you. The priest knows every gossip going in the town; he knows how many
husbands are flirting with other people's wives, he knows who is doing
what. They themselves go on confessing it. This is the priest's strategy
to keep control of his congregation. You cannot leave the congregation
because the priest can expose you. And also you are afraid that if you
leave the congregation the priest may not ask God for you to be
forgiven, and you have committed so many sins. Now it is too late.
You</p><p>have to remain in the same herd, in the same crowd, for your whole
life.</p><p>I teach you not to be responsible to anybody; the father, the mother,
the country, the religion, the party line -- don't be responsible to
anybody. You are not. Just be responsible to yourself. Do whatsoever you
feel like doing. If it is wrong, the</p><p>punishment will immediately follow. If it is right, the reward will
follow immediately, instantly. There is no other way.</p><p>This way you will start finding what is wrong, what is right, on your
own. You will grow a new sensitivity -- Indians call it the third eye.
You will start seeing with a new vision, a new eye. Instantly you will
know what is wrong, because in the past so many times you have done it
and always suffered in consequence. You will know what is right, because
whenever you did existence showered great blessings on you. Cause and
effect are together, they are not separated by years and lives.</p><p>You are responsible then. If you want and enjoy a certain act,
although it brings suffering, then do it. It is good, because you enjoy
it. The suffering is not big enough to deter you from the enjoyment that
your act brings. But it is up to you, wholly and solely up to you to
decide. If the suffering is too much and the act brings nothing, no joy,
and necessarily a long anguish follows it, then it is up to you if you
are an absolute idiot, and what can anybody do about it?</p><p>This is what I mean by being responsible to yourself. There is no God
on whom you can dump your responsibility, but you are always searching
to dump on somebody, even on a poor man like me, who is continuously
telling you that I am not responsible for anything, for anybody. Still,
somehow, deep down you go on carrying the illusion that I must be
joking.</p><p>I am not joking. He is our Master, you must be thinking, how can He
say that He is not responsible? But you don't understand. Dumping your
responsibility on me, you will remain retarded, childish. You will never
grow. The only way to grow is to accept all good, bad, the joyful, the
sorrowful. Everything that happens to you, you are responsible for. That
gives you great freedom.</p><p>If I am responsible for something, then the key to your actions is in
my hands. Then you are a slave to me. Then you are a puppet and the
strings are in my hand. I say dance, you dance; I say stop, you stop. Of
course, the puppet cannot be responsible for anything. The puppeteer,
who is behind the screen, is always responsible.</p><p>God is the great puppeteer. And all these popes and saints and
mahatmas are great puppets, just mediators between the big puppeteer and
you. They are also puppets, but they are great puppets because they
follow every single instruction from on high, absolutely. You are a
little smaller puppet. Once in a while you dance on your own, too. Once
in a while the puppeteer goes on pulling your strings and you don't
dance.</p><p>The moment I say there is no puppeteer, no God, no saint, it is all
rubbish, I am trying to give you total freedom. I am making you
absolutely responsible for everything that happens to you or does not
happen. Rejoice in this freedom. Rejoice in this great understanding
that you are responsible for everything in your life. This will make you
what I call the individual. And to become the individual is to know all
that is worth knowing, is to experience all that is worth experiencing.
To be an individual is to be liberated, is to be enlightened.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-7>The Last Testament, Vol 1

title: The Time Is Short 24 July 1985 pm in Jesus Grove</h1><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This discourse is published in the book: The Last Testament,
Volume 1, as Chapter 17.]</p><p>Swami Anand Maitreya BHAGWAN MAGAZINE, INDIA</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BELOVED BHAGWAN, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BECOME DISCIPLES, TO
PARTICIPATE IN YOUR VISION IN THIS NEW PHENOMENON. YET WE ARE AFRAID TO
TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DEFEND THIS VISION. THE FEW PEOPLE WHO DO
TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED BY SANNYASINS FOR THAT.
WHY THIS CRITICISM?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: My vision is so new, so revolutionary, that if you are all
massacred for it, it will not be a surprise to me. I am fighting against
the whole past of humanity. Nobody has ever done that. Christians were
fighting with the Jews, Mohammedans were fighting with the Hindus,
Jainas were fighting with the Buddhists; but this is happening for the
first time -- one single man standing against the whole history of man.
And you are choosing to be with such a man. Your participation, your
devotion, your love, are towards a very dangerous man. But I don't see
that the whole past -- it is vast and big -- can destroy what I am
saying.</p><p>The past is not in my favor. I don't want it to be in my favor, I
want to destroy it from the very roots. But the future is mine, the
future is yours, and the future is far greater than the whole past. The
forces of the future are far bigger than all the forces of the past,
because the past is dead. Life knows no past. It is in the present and
always moving into the future.</p><p>People will be against you. People will condemn you, particularly
those who are trying to materialize my vision. Don't care a bit about
their criticism and their condemnation. They are just on the verge of
their graves. They have failed. They have been promising man for
thousands of years and all their promises have proved false. Man has
remained poor, sick, starving, a slave to so many things, imprisoned,
chained. They have driven man almost to madness. They have completely
failed.</p><p>Naturally, they will be offended by your small successes. They have
not even been able to achieve small victories. Just your very presence
is offensive to them for the simple reason that you are rejoicing,
enjoying, loving, and they have never loved, they have never enjoyed.
They have always been guilty, feeling the burden of so many sins. How
can they dance? When you see their situation, you will be able to
forgive them for their condemnation. They have missed their life, and
you are not missing a single moment.</p><p>They are jealous of you. Their condemnation and criticism arise out
of their jealousy. When everybody else is depressed, you are dancing.
You are taking a risk. Those depressed people will not allow you to
dance. They will try to prevent you. They will start telling others that
you are mad.</p><p>I have heard a story about a faraway mountain land where a community
of blind people lived. Nobody was born blind, but there was a certain
fly whose bite made the person immediately blind. Every child was born
with eyes, but those flies were there all around. It was impossible to
escape from those flies. All the older people, the adults, the mothers
and fathers, could not do anything -- they were all blind. The whole
community was blind.</p><p>The fly affected only a certain age-group, below five years of age.
Five years is a long time for a child, and the fly was all around.
Within those five years... any moment. In fact, within six months every
child was blind; those flies were not waiting for five years.</p><p>For the first time, a stranger came into the community from faraway
lands. He was an adventurer. Seeing from the hilltop thousands of blind
people, he could not believe his own eyes. He felt immensely sorry for
them. He forgot about his further exploration in the mountains and he
remained with those people. He wanted to help them somehow. He wanted to
find what had happened. It is acceptable that in thousands of people
there may be one man blind -- that he knew -- but in thousands of people
not a single man with eyes? -- it was a great challenge for him. He
wanted to find out what was the matter, what had happened.</p><p>Soon he was able to find out that every child was born with eyes, and
every child became blind within six months. He discovered the fly, too,
which was a common fly. But while he was doing this research, why these
poor people had all gone blind, he fell in love with a blind girl. She
was immensely beautiful. He had seen beauty before, but this girl's
beauty was a category in itself, incomparable. Although she was blind,
she looked like a marble statue made not by any amateur, but by some
Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p>The girl was still unmarried. A great problem arose in the community,
because never before had it happened that anybody from their community
had married somebody, particularly a stranger -- and more emphatically,
a man who is mad because he thinks he has eyes. But they were simple
mountain people, they did not want to make these two young people
miserable.</p><p>The community agreed that the man could marry the girl, but first he
had to become blind. Then he would be one of them, no more a stranger.
First he had to drop that madness that he had eyes -- who had ever heard
about eyes? -- if he was not willing to drop that insane idea, then the
marriage was not possible. He was not only a stranger, he was insane
too. The man so loved the girl that he destroyed his eyes. In his life,
for the first time, love became blind. For love he became blind.</p><p>Why could those people not accept that he had eyes? It was against
the egos of the whole community. They were blind and he had eyes. He was
somebody special, so either he was mad, imagining, hallucinating about
eyes, or perhaps he had eyes. But then he could not be tolerated,
allowed to continue to have eyes, because he would remain a stranger, an
outsider, and the very idea that he had eyes made everyone feel
inferior. The day he destroyed his eyes and said, "I have dropped that
idea of being a man with eyes," there was great rejoicing, dancing,
singing.</p><p>This is the situation. This is my situation. This is your situation.
On your own accord you have become part of my caravan. I had started
alone; then people went on coming, and the caravan went on becoming
bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Now we are a reality the world cannot
tolerate. They will condemn you, they will curse you, they will
criticize you -- but they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that
they are mere ghosts of the past.</p><p>They are not living people. They can make much noise, but you just
have to remember that they are dead and that the future does not belong
to them. They can look backwards into the past. They can sing songs of
glory about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Mahavira, but they don't have any
eyes for the future. They don't have even eyes for the present. And to
have eyes for the past is absolutely meaningless, because the past is no
more. It is dead, it is a long, long graveyard. And suddenly you come
and start dancing and singing and celebrating. It hurts their egos. It
makes them feel inferior. When they have missed joy, how dare you dance
and sing? And for what? They know only one thing, that you can be happy.
But for happiness you need a certain cause... and I am teaching you that
happiness is your nature. You don't need any cause.</p><p>It is not that when you win a lottery of one million dollars, you
give a big party, wine and women and dance. This will be understood. I
am saying you need not win any lottery, you need no cause to be
blissful. Blissfulness is your very nature. Sadness needs a certain
cause. Bliss is free of all causality. Once you have understood it, you
become a participant in a new way of life, a way so new that it is
discontinuous with the past.</p><p>But you have to understand that all those poor people who have missed
are going to be angry with you. In their criticism, in their
condemnation, there is nothing but jealousy, anger. They cannot believe
that you can be right, because for millions of years they have lived the
life of sadness and sorrow and suddenly a few strangers arrive on the
earth as if from another planet and start doing</p><p>things which have never been done. They would like to destroy you so
they feel comfortable; they would like that you are not. They will feel
a certain satisfaction that whatever they are is the only reality, that
there is no other reality.</p><p>But they cannot destroy you for the simple reason that you are
living. You are vital energy and they are spent cartridges. They can
shoot you with their guns, but their guns are full of spent cartridges.
They cannot destroy you. Life is so strong and death is so weak. Joy is
so strong and sadness is just a shadow. You are undefeatable.</p><p>When they condemn you, enjoy that, too. When they criticize you, sing
a song as a response to their criticism, and don't pay much attention to
them. Ignore them. Anyway, they are going down, drowning. Don't waste
your time arguing with drowning people. You continue your dance, and you
go on spreading your dance. Religion, in the authentic, true sense, is
here.</p><p>You may not be aware that you are participating in something which is
so important that nothing like it has ever happened before. And because
you are capable, intelligent, you can forgive them. Not to let them feel
inferior, you can forgive them, knowing that they are on their deathbed
and you are just starting to grow and live and flower. There is no
comparison.</p><p>One journalist has asked if my commune can live in coexistence with
the neighbors. In the first place, there are no neighbors, we are alone
on the earth. Ghosts are not neighbors, graveyards are not
neighborhoods. Those dead people, although they are still breathing, are
not alive. Just to breathe is not enough to claim life. Much more is
needed.</p><p>Just to breathe is to vegetate -- even trees are breathing. Being
able to walk is not much; animals and even a few trees can walk. In
Africa, trees walk miles away from their place of origin to find new
sources of water. Of course it is a very slow journey, but they go on
spreading their roots, and slowly go on moving miles away to where they
can find water, miles away to where they can find open sky, the sun.</p><p>Yes, these people we are surrounded with are breathing, walking,
eating, doing all kinds of things which any robot is capable of doing.
Any mechanical device will be able to do all that these people are
doing, but no robot can feel joy without any cause. No robot can be
meditative and experience silence, ecstasy, blissfulness. What
coexistence can there be between living, overflowing people and the
dead? -- or the nearly dead, which is even worse. If you are dead, at
least a misery is finished, a long tragedy has come to an end; but
nearly dead, almost dead, life is not there but the tragedy continues.
They have enough energy for misery. Misery does not need much energy.
You cannot say that you are so weak you cannot be miserable. Can you say
that? -- that I am feeling so weak today that I cannot feel
miserable?</p><p>Misery needs no energy. It is easy, cheap, costs nothing. But to be
blissful, to be dancing and singing, to be a joy to yourself and others,
certainly you need energy, more energy than is needed only for survival.
If a tree gets enough</p><p>energy just to survive, it will not flower. No fruits will come for
the simple reason that flowering is an overflowing of energy. The tree
has so many colors within it, so much fragrance that it cannot contain
it anymore. It has to be shared with existence, with the sun, with the
moon, with the wind, with the birds. That's how flowers come and open
up. That's how it gives you fruits -- it has so much life energy that it
can give.</p><p>These people who condemn you because you have become a participant
with a man who is against the whole past of man, just forgive them. They
do not know that they are being foolish. Rather than wasting their
energy in condemnation and criticism, they should come closer to you,
know you better, feel you deeper; because if this ecstasy is possible to
you, it is possible to them also. Howsoever late, it is still
possible.</p><p>There is a proverb in India: if you get lost in the morning but
somehow manage to come back home by the evening, you are not lost. These
people you are surrounded by are coming closer and closer to evening,
but they are still far away from home. And if they could not find home
in the sunlight, it cannot be conceived that they can find home when the
sun has set and the darkness of night covers the earth.</p><p>That darkness is not far away. Its name is the third world war. Every
moment we are coming closer to it. That is going to be the night,
unending, perhaps forever and forever. It is going to destroy all that
is living and all possibility for life to exist on this planet. It has
happened on other planets; it is now a recognized scientific fact that
there are planets which give indications that some day life had existed
there. How it disappeared nobody knows, but soon we will know how it
disappears.</p><p>But there is time still, even if the sun is setting, there is time
still. Those people, if they are intelligent, will come and try to mix
with you, so that they can understand where they got lost, where they
missed the right path.</p><p>So remember, those who are intelligent are going to become
participants in this caravan. Those who are retarded will criticize you,
condemn you. Ignore them. They are already stepping into their graves,
soon they will disappear. They don't have any vision for the future,
they don't have any solution for the problems that the past has
created.</p><p>Every day more and more problems are being created by their past, and
not a single solution. We don't have any problems from the past, any
hangups. And we can see clearly that all their problems can be solved.
But they are blind and deaf; they cannot listen, they cannot see.
Perhaps they don't want to see, they don't want to listen because that
will make them feel more inferior. They want to continue to feel that
they are superior beings, that the problems are bad, the problems are
insoluble, but they are doing their best. If the problems still remain,
what can they do?</p><p>I want to say to you that those problems are their creations. With
one hand they go on creating the problem, with the other they go on
trying to solve it. Their</p><p>right hand knows not what their left hand is doing. I have not come
across a single problem which cannot be solved right now. But they have
their vested interests -- and if the problem is solved, then what will
happen to their vested interests? So they go on talking about solving
the problem -- poverty, war, disease, death -- but just talking, and
they have been talking for thousands of years. Their philosophers have
been thinking, creating great treatises, but what is the outcome? What
is the outcome of that whole genius of the past? How have Kant, Hegel,
Feuerbach, Bradley, Bosake helped to solve any human problems? Has
Mohammed, or Jesus, or Buddha, or Mahavira been able to give any
solution so that man can live at peace?</p><p>No. On the contrary, they all created more problems, they added more
problems. The older ones were there, they created new ones with their
so-called solutions. It is really very surprising and amazing to see
into the past and to see the people who have been adored in the past,
respected like gods. And what is their contribution? Nobody asks.</p><p>What has Krishna given to the world? Nothing at all. Yes, a few
problems, certainly. He has given the idea to the Hindus that they are
the right people, that everybody else is wrong in the world. Hindus
think they are the purest race, everybody else is impure. Hindus go on
saying that it is a great blessing, that they are fortunate to be born
as Hindus. To be born as Christians or Mohammedans would have been a
condemnation from the very beginning. Unless you have committed some
great sins in the past, how can you become a born Mohammedan, a born
Christian? All the virtuous people are born brahmins, Hindus.</p><p>But the same kind of idea is given by these so-called geniuses to
everybody. Jesus says to Christians the same stupid thing: You are the
very promise, all God's hopes are with you. Everybody has gone wrong,
now only you can help people to come to the right path. Moses says to
the Jews: You are the chosen people of God. You are born to rule over
the world.</p><p>Now, what is the difference between Moses and Adolf Hitler? From
where did he get this idea that German Nordics are the purest Aryan race
in the world and they have, by their very birth, the right to rule over
the world? Adolf Hitler must have got it from Moses. Perhaps that's why
he killed one million Jews.</p><p>You will be wondering what the relation is between them. It is very
simple. What Hitler is claiming is also being claimed by Moses. Those
claims are going to be clashed against each other -- either the Jews are
to rule the world, or the German Nordics. Both cannot rule the world,
both cannot be the purest and the highest race. Something had to be
decided, and he decided. By killing one million Jews, he made it clear
to them who is higher, more powerful, stronger.</p><p>Religious leaders, political leaders, they are all sailing in the
same boat. I see man's whole past as utterly impotent. It has not
contributed more beauty to the world, more joy to beings, more health,
more happiness. It has not been creative. It has been simply
destructive. I am totally against it.</p><p>It has been asked by very scholarly professors, "As you are a
rational person, how can you say that everything in the past is wrong?
Something must be right, too. There must be something that is good in
Buddha's approach, something good in Jesus' approach. You may not agree
with their total message, but to deny the total message -- not of one
person, one country, one culture, not of one civilization, but of all
the civilizations, all the cultures, all the prophets, all the messiahs,
all the religions!"</p><p>This professor was the professor of Buddhism in Benares University.
His name was Bhikshu Jagdish Kashyap -- he said, "You are a rational
man. I cannot see how you can say this." I said to him that just because
I am a rational man I can say it, and also can prove it.</p><p>Yes, there are things in Buddha which look beautiful. There are words
of Jesus which look beautiful. But remember one thing: Jesus is one
organic whole, his good words cannot be separated from his bad deeds.
Buddha has to be taken as a whole, because whatsoever he says and does
is interconnected. You cannot just cut pieces from different people, the
good ones, the nice ones, and make a living culture out of it. That is
impossible. In the first place, the moment you take a small piece from
Mohammed, it is already dead. It was alive in the Mohammedan context.
Once it loses that context it has no meaning at all.</p><p>For example, Jesus says: Blessed are those who are the last in this
world, because they will be the first in my kingdom of God. A beautiful
sentence. To find something wrong with such a beautiful sentence is
difficult. Even enemies of Jesus cannot do that.</p><p>I am not an enemy, neither am I a friend. I am simply looking with
open eyes, with no emotional antagonism, favoritism. He says: Blessed
are those who are the last. But how many people can be the last? If the
whole humanity is standing in a queue, one man will be the last; and if
humanity is standing in a circle, then it will be impossible to find who
is the last. And how do you determine? What is the criterion to decide
who is the last?-the beggar?</p><p>Buddha was a beggar. Do you have the guts to say that he is the last?
He had nothing but his begging bowl, that was his only possession, but
you cannot say he is the last. He was so magnificent a person that you
can only put him as the first -- this world or that does not matter. And
Jesus is saying this thing without considering how long humanity has
existed. How many people would have been the last in each generation?
And why were they last in the first place? They had no intelligence,
they had no strength, they had no guts to move. These will be the first
in the kingdom of God? -- then in the kingdom of God only idiots will be
found, and those who are intelligent, geniuses, they will be thrown into
hell because they were never the last.</p><p>A beautiful sentence, but if you start thinking and dissecting it,
you find that you will have to accept Jesus' whole theology. Only in
that context can that sentence have any meaning.</p><p>Buddha says beautiful things but also says stupid things. Now, I
cannot conceive of a man doing both things together. On the one hand he
says that men and women are equal; on the other hand he is not willing
to initiate women into sannyas. Now what to make of it? If they are
equal, then why are you preventing the equal people equal
opportunity?</p><p>Certainly they are not equal. Your action proves they are not equal.
You initiate the most idiotic man and you are not willing to initiate
the most intelligent woman. Then, when you say men and women are equal,
it seems to be just a political, diplomatic statement. It has no value.
You yourself have canceled it completely.</p><p>I have looked into the past, I have tried my best to find something.
It is always connected with something which is ugly. Now the Hindu god
Rama is a beautiful person, if you are not very alert. If you are very
alert, you will find that this man is an enemy of humanity. His wife was
stolen by another king. Three years he had to fight to get the wife
back. Poets and Hindu saints praise him because he respected womanhood
so much that he fought for three years. Otherwise, in those days, who
bothered? Every king had many wives, who cares if one is lost? It looks
right, the man must be very respectful towards women.</p><p>But the same man when he is victorious, when he takes out his wife
Sita from the imprisonment of the enemy king, the first words that he
says destroy him completely. He says: Listen, woman -- he is not even
saying, My dear, my darling. Three years of separation, and the word he
uses is derogatory -- "Listen, woman, I have not fought this war for
you. I have fought this war for my own prestige, for my kingdom's
prestige, for my forefathers' prestige. It is not a question of you, so
don't get a big head because Rama fought for you for three years."</p><p>These are ugly words. And then he is known to have forced the woman
to pass through fire to prove that she is pure, that she has not made
love to the enemy king. In the first place, it is such a stupid idea
that the fire will judge whether the woman is pure or not.</p><p>You can try it. Do a small experiment. Speak something absolutely
truthfully. Speak something which cannot be in any way untrue. Say the
time in your clock at this moment, and put your hand just on a candle
flame to see whether you are true or not. And you will know that the
candle flame does not bother whether your clock is there or not, whether
you are saying the truth or untruth. It is going to burn you. Then try a
lie, anything that cannot be true in any possible way, that two and two
make five, and put your hand on the flame. See whether it burns you
more, less, or the same. Fire has its own laws.</p><p>Now, putting this poor woman who has been three years in prison
waiting to see her husband, crying and weeping... this is the welcome.
And I do not understand how she becomes impure even if she has made
love. On what grounds is she impure? And, secondly, Rama himself was
three years without his wife. He also should have walked through fire to
prove his purity. That he does not do. This is</p><p>strange, that only the woman has to be pure, and man need not bother
about such small things. You ask the wife to be pure, at least you
should have the courage to go through the same test.</p><p>The story is beautiful. Sita passes through the fire, is not burned
by the fire. It cannot be an historical fact, but just for argument's
sake we accept that she survived the fire. But it did not make Rama any
more respectful towards her.</p><p>When they reached their capital, one washerman, just one washerman,
condemned -- that too in his privacy -- his wife, because she had not
been home the whole night. In the morning when she came, he was angry,
started beating her, and told her, "This won't do. Where have you been
the whole night? With whom? And remember, I am not Rama that I will
accept you. One night is enough, now get out of here. I am not Rama, who
accepted Sita after three years." The message was brought to Rama by one
of his people who was passing and heard the washerman's statement, that
one man in the capital was shouting loudly, "I am not Rama. I cannot
tolerate such things" -- and this was enough.</p><p>What happened about the fire test? Rama renounced Sita again, and
sent her back into the forest, into an ashram. He abandoned her. And
Hindus go on saying that this must be something right, unless there is
nothing right. Then people like Mahatma Gandhi continuously worshipped
Rama. His last words were, "Ah, Rama!" when he was shot dead. But the
way Rama behaved with his wife was just ugly, inhuman. She was pregnant,
and she was thrown into the forest, abandoned. For what? Again it was a
question of prestige.</p><p>One man has suspected her integrity. I don't see the point. If he
thought that it</p><p>was a question of prestige, he should have gone with Sita to the
forest and renounced the kingdom -- "I don't care about the kingdom, I
love the woman. I love her purity. I put her under the fire test, now
what more I can do?" But no, the kingdom was too precious. The prestige
of the family was too precious, and just one idiot washerman was enough
to make a statement and Sita was abandoned.</p><p>Now, whatsoever good things this man may have said and done -- I have
looked into everything minutely, and I have tried to find something good
that can be taken out -- I am puzzled, because with that good thing so
many things are joined absolutely. You choose it, you choose all that
which is connected with it organically.</p><p>It is not a hasty judgment on my part that I abandon the whole past
of humanity. For almost forty years I have been continuously trying to
be fair and to find something that can be saved. But I'm sorry to say to
you that there is nothing. It is far better to start humanity anew, from
the very scratch, fresh.</p><p>Naturally, you will be in danger. I am in danger. I have put myself
in danger, this is my responsibility. You have become my participant;
that is not my responsibility, that is your responsibility. I have made
it clear to you that being with me is dangerous. Still you choose to be
with me. It is your responsibility.</p><p>I don't want to take your responsibility, because with responsibility
goes your freedom, too. That's how things are connected. You will feel
good if I say, "I will take your responsibility, don't be worried." You
will feel good, not knowing that your freedom is finished. Now I am the
Master and you are simply a follower. I have reduced you into a certain
inferiority. No, I cannot do that.</p><p>I am a master of myself, but you are not my followers. My mastery
does not depend on your following. It depends on my experience. Even if
all the followers are gone, I will still be the same Master. You are not
my followers. I emphasize it again and again that you are my fellow
travelers, that I am doing something risky, that I am walking on the
razor's edge. And you have chosen to be with me, with full
responsibility and freedom. Then you are not inferior and I am not
superior.</p><p>I want to destroy all kinds of inequalities in the world. They are
all the same -- man is higher, the woman is lower; the white man is
higher, the black man is lower; the Master is higher, the disciple is
lower. I want a very simple fact to be recognized: Everybody is unique,
incomparable. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower.</p><p>Let the whole world condemn; the victory is going to be ours, because
we are the people of the rising sun and they are hanging around the
sunset. Soon they will disappear into the darkness and be lost forever.
And the sooner it happens, the better. But you have a vast future ahead
of you, a tremendous opportunity to create man again, because the old
man has failed, and the new man is needed urgently. We are living in one
of the hottest times. There has never been such an emergency before. The
time is short and the job is immense. But, if you are intelligent,
silent, blissful, it can be done.</p><p>And it can be done without any hardship. It can be done almost as if
it is fun, and I don't want you to be serious. I want to create the new
man in a very nonserious way, playfully. The old man was serious. I
don't want even that connection with the new man. The new man must be
playful, nonserious. No God, no hell, no heaven, nobody to impose what
is right and what is wrong except your own awareness to decide and then
to accept the consequences.</p><p>I love one of the statements of a Baul fakir -- baul means a mad man.
His name was Chandidas. He says, Sabar upar manus satya, tahar upar
nahin. "Above all is the truth of man, and above that there is nothing."
No God, no heaven, no hell. He was condemned as a madman, and he was
saying one of the basic fundamentals. You will be condemned, you will be
cursed, you will be criticized, but you cannot be defeated, because the
time is with you. The future is with you. Only the new man can survive.
The old man is almost fading away. Say goodbye to the old man, he has
done enough nuisance on the earth. It is time that the new man takes
over and does not repeat the old mistakes.</p><p>Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, THE MIND IS AN EXPLOITER OF EVERY SITUATION. EVEN
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SITUATION OF BEING AROUND</p><p>YOU IS EXPLOITED IN TERMS OF HIGHER AND LOWER, SPECIAL AND
NON-SPECIAL, MORE MEDITATIVE AND LESS MEDITATIVE, CLOSER AND NOT CLOSE.
HOW CAN AVOID THESE EXPLOITATIONS?</p><p>A: There is not much difficulty in it. Simply drop the whole
idea.</p><p>I am teaching you every day that there is nothing higher, nothing
lower. It is simply man's ego creating if not money, if not politics,
then meditation. The ego can exploit any situation, but it will play the
same game. One is higher in meditation, the other is lower in
meditation. One is an older sannyasin, senior -- as if it is a
government bureaucracy -- and the other one is a new fellow. You can
tolerate him, but he is not to be considered much, not to be taken
seriously. It is the same ego, you just have to watch.</p><p>It is the same ego. Whenever it creates any comparison and brings the
qualities of higher and lower and judgments, immediately cut its head,
then and there. Take a deep breath and drop it. Exhale it! And it is
only a question of a few days and the wrong habit disappears. It is only
a wrong habit, nothing to be worried about, a hangover from the old
society where everything is compared, everything is put in a certain
hierarchic system.</p><p>You have come from the old society with much junk from the old
society within you. Be alert and go on cleansing yourself of the old, of
the past, of all you have brought with you. Become emptier, become
cleaner. And it feels so beautiful. It feels so ecstatic that I can only
be silent about it. I cannot say anything about it.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-8>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 18.]</p><p>Denise Kovacevic KATU TV, CHANNEL 2 PORTLANDS, OREGON</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME OUT TO SPEAK WITH US
THIS AFTERNOON.</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: Thank you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTION ON MY MIND IS, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU,
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR RELIGION, THAT PEOPLE FIND SO APPEALING? WE SEE
PEOPLE LIKE ISABEL AND SHEELA AND SARITA AND K.D., PEOPLE THAT WE THINK
ARE LIKE OURSELVES, AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE HERE, AND WE ASK OURSELVES,
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE THAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE?</p><p>A: It is very simple. I am so ordinary a man that nobody can feel any
inferiority with me. And all the so-called religious leaders of the
world were nothing but egoists, making everybody feel inferior, guilty,
sinners. I don't make anybody feel guilty. If he feels guilty already,
just coming to me his guilt disappears. I transform sinners into saints
instantly, and that's what appeals to them -- that I am one of them, and
they're my fellow travelers, not my followers.</p><p>I am nobody's leader. They are not sheep and I am not their shepherd.
I am just a human being, as they are. And my emphasis is that every
human being has the birthright to become enlightened. This is nothing
special.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT ARE YOU REALLY AN ORDINARY MAN? WHEN WE SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
PART OF THE COMMUNE AND WHO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY OF LIFE, THEY SEEM TO
WORSHIP YOU, AND THEY TREAT YOU WITH REVERENCE, THEY TREAT YOU WITH
RESPECT THAT, PERHAPS, THEY WOULD NOT TREAT OTHER PEOPLE. SO DO YOU
REALLY CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ORDINARY MAN? YOU CALL YOURSELF THE
ENLIGHTENED ONE.</p><p>A: I am. I don't consider, I don't think. I am just an ordinary man.
And that's why they adore me. They have adored for centuries people who
are just egoists, people who have been deceiving them, calling
themselves prophets, messiahs, only begotten son of God, and all kinds
of nonsense. They are intelligent enough to see that I am not putting
any burden on them. I am trying to remove all burden. I am saying to
them continuously there is no need to worship me, because I am just
amongst you. There is no need for adoration.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THEY DO GIVE IT, AND THEY DO NOT TREAT YOU AS AN EQUAL.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is the problem. The more I try to be nobody, the more they
love me. Now what do you propose I should do?</p><p>Q: I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I'M
SUPPOSED TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT THEIR LEADER,
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THEM? DO YOU JUST SET AN EXAMPLE? WHAT DO YOU OFFER
THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't offer them anything except myself. I am available to them.
I have no secrets. I am completely open. All the prophets and the
messiahs had secrets, esoteric philosophies. I have none.</p><p>But I say to them that being nothing, nobody, brings you all the
blessings of the world. And just being close to me, slowly they start
feeling also that they are nobodies, nobody is special. And the moment
one feels he is nobody, the whole existence starts pouring immense
blissfulness. It showers on him like flowers. And once you have known
the secret, that is how you can commune with existence.</p><p>With your ego you cannot commune with existence; you are separating
yourself. With no ego, there is communion. And that communion is
enlightenment. That is real godliness. I don't have any God to offer
them, but certainly I can show them the way to godliness. And remember,
godliness is nothing special. It is our birthright, we just have to
claim it.</p><p>It has been said for centuries, again and again, that you have to
earn virtue. It will take many times, many lives for you to reach the
kingdom of God. They have made it very far away, it is always beyond
death. I say to my people that this is sheer stupidity. They were
exploiting people's gullibility. They were exploiting people s hope.</p><p>I am saying to them that there is nothing beyond this moment. Don't
wait for any Godot. Live this moment in its totality and squeeze the
whole juice out of it. And if the next moment comes, do the same to it.
Go on squeezing each moment and you will be surprised that unawares you
have entered into paradise. In this very</p><p>life, here and now, existence knows only one tense: the present. It
knows no past, it knows no future.</p><p>So I simply help them to be here and now, getting more rooted in the
present, and then everything becomes possible. And it is not a question
of deserving God. We are part of existence already. It is not a question
of earning. No virtue is needed, because it is not a bargain, not a
business. Just we have to be a little quiet, silent, so we can hear the
still small voice within. And we can also hear the silent music that
surrounds the whole existence.</p><p>And that I call godliness. There is no God, but there is certainly a
quality of tremendous beauty, grace, love.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY: IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP THE PUBLIC
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO BE A SANNYASIN? I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE:
MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS. THEY BELIEVE
THAT CHRIST IS THE SAVIOR, THE MESSIAH. CHRISTIANS TRY TO LIVE THEIR
LIVES ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN SET OF STANDARDS. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING
BRIEF LIKE THAT FOR HOW SANNYASINS LIVE?</p><p>A: I don't have anything like that. I don't have any catechism, any
dogma. I don't offer any principles, any philosophy, any theology. My
sannyasins live individual lives in freedom.</p><p>Q: SO THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD SANNYASIN, LIKE THERE IS A BAD
CHRISTIAN, OR...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There is no good sannyasin, there is no bad sannyasin; there
are only sannyasins. Good and bad are ugly words and I have dissolved
them completely. Here is no judgment. Everybody has to be responsible
for himself, his freedom and whatsoever he wants to do with his life. So
it is difficult for me, impossible, to explain to the outside people how
a sannyasin is. The only way is to invite him to be here, live with the
sannyasins, experience what they are going through. Taste it -- their
fragrance will be my explanation. The taste of being with the sannyasins
is my theology. Those people will have to come to the well, the well
does not go to the thirsty.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, IF THERE IS NO GOOD AND BAD AND NO JUDGING, HOW DOES ONE KNOW
IF HE IS IMPROVING? OR IS THERE EVEN A NEED TO IMPROVE? OR IS THAT UP TO
THE INDIVIDUAL? OKAY, AM I HAPPY WITH WHAT I AM DOING NOW, AM I HAPPY
WITH THE LEVEL I AM AT NOW?</p><p>A: I do not teach that you have to become somebody other than what
you are. No improvement is needed. No goal is there to be achieved.
Whatever you need is already provided by existence each moment. It is up
to you how to use it, or not to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BIBLE. I DO KNOW A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS ALMOST SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS
IN THE BIBLE: THAT ANSWERS ARE THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOUR EYES
AND SEE THEM. EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED IS HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU JUST HAVE
TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO IT. THE ANSWERS ARE ALL THERE.</p><p>A: No, it is not in the Bible. You don't know anything about the
Bible. In the Bible it is said, seek and ye shall find, ask and you will
receive the answer, knock and the door shall be opened. This is totally
against what I am saying. I am saying, seek and you will miss. Do not
seek because it is here right now. In seeking you will forget the moment
which is slipping by. Do not ask because you are the answer. Why become
a question? It is simply stupid to become a question when you can become
the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR WAY
OF LIFE?</p><p>A: I don't care. I simply allow them their freedom -- nor do I
subscribe to their philosophy, their religion. It is perfectly right
they don't subscribe. But we are not at all worried about them. They are
worried about us. That makes the difference. Somehow they are troubled
by us. We are not troubled.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DOES THAT AMUSE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, it amuses me immensely. It is our whole entertainment. Their
worry, their concern, their continuous curiosity makes it clear that
whatever philosophy, theology, religion they belong to, it is not giving
them what they want. It is not making them joyful. It is not making them
sing, dance. It is not giving them anything substantial, any
nourishment.</p><p>That is the reason they go on looking, perhaps somewhere else.… They
are curious, but also afraid, because they have been conditioned. They
have lived according to a certain dogma. A man who has lived for seventy
years according to a certain dogma is in a really big mess if he comes
across sannyasins. He can see there are people who are happy, dancing,
singing for no reason at all. To dance is enough, a reason unto itself.
To sing is enough, you need not be rewarded for it in heaven. In the
very singing of it you are rewarded.</p><p>They can see these people are happy. That makes them curious. But
they are afraid to come too close, because of their seventy years'
devotion to Christ, to the Bible. They don't want to recognize the fact
that for seventy years they have been idiotic, not Christian. They have
been calling their stupidity Christianity. It needs guts to come close
to my sannyasins. Those who have guts, they are coming, from all over
the world. Those who have no guts, let them go to hell. It is none of
our business to interfere in their journey, in their pilgrimage to hell.
Let them go.</p><p>Q: HOW MANY SANNYASINS ARE THERE NOW THROUGHOUT THE WORLD? WE HAD
HEARD THAT PERHAPS YOUR NUMBERS WERE SHRINKING AND THERE WERE NOT AS
MANY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Never shrinking. We are always expanding. But we don't bother
about numbers, we don't even have an exact account of how many people
are there. But they are every day growing; around the world in every
center people are taking sannyas, joining communes. There are almost
eight hundred thousand sannyasins.</p><p>And a few have left; they can be counted very easily on ten
fingers... a dozen or two dozen people. And even though they have left,
they are in tremendous trouble, because once a sannyasin, you cannot
again become part of the old world. Now they are in a limbo. They cannot
mix with the old world. I have already deprogrammed them. They cannot go
to the church and listen to the sermon without thinking this is idiotic.
They cannot come back because of their egos. Now that they have left,
how should they approach Bhagwan again? I would like them to know that
the doors are open. Nobody is going to ask you why you had left. We
never ask anybody why they have come.</p><p>Q: IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN TOP, OR VISIBLE POSITIONS
ANYWAY, IN THE COMMUNE AND WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND THE RELIGION ARE
WOMEN. WHY? HOW DID THAT COME TO BE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. Because I am a man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. I love them. I love you.</p><p>Q:... AND WE HAVE ONLY MET.… DO YOU THINK THAT -- THIS IS GETTING
INTERESTING -- DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN ARE NECESSARILY BETTER THAN OR
MORE IMPORTANT THAN, OR PERHAPS SMARTER THAN MEN?</p><p>A: They are lovelier, delicious, tasteful. And they have been
repressed for centuries, that's why they appear not to be so intelligent
as men. Otherwise, they are exactly equally as intelligent as men. And
more earthly than the man. Man is always a moongazer: the woman doesn't
care about the moon. She cares about the earth, her concern is very
practical.</p><p>And I am creating a certain way of life which is not schizophrenic,
which does not divide materialism from spiritualism, a life in which
materialism and spiritualism are together -- not as enemies, not as
contradictories, but as complementaries. And one has to begin from the
earth. Even if you have to go to the moon, you have to begin from the
earth. The woman is very earthly. I don't need moongazers, I need very
earthly people. And the woman gives roots to you. A man without a woman
is without roots.</p><p>Q: IS THERE A SPECIAL WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE? OR DO YOU HAVE MANY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have so many that it is very difficult to say who is special. In
this moment you are. It is moment to moment.</p><p>Q: WELL, OKAY, OTHER THAN THIS MOMENT, IS THERE A COMPANION THAT YOU
SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I don't make any contracts, particularly about love, because
love is a very delicate phenomenon. It is just like the wind. A cool
breeze comes in and passes from the other door. You cannot catch hold of
it, you can enjoy it, but if you try to catch hold of it you miss the
moment of enjoyment. In a closed fist there is no wind. If you want to
enjoy, keep the fist open.</p><p>I have no contract with anybody. I never promise anything. Because I
don't know if tomorrow I will be there or not. And who knows, the next
moment somebody else enters into my life, and I am enchanted. I never
make any promise.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW CAN SOMETHING SO FLEETING GIVE A MAN ROOTS THEN?</p><p>A: It gives you roots. It is not that you love one woman, then you
will get roots. What gives you roots is that you love. Lovers can change
but your love remains. And that gives you roots. That is permanent, that
is not a fleeting thing. I have always loved. Addresses have changed,
but I have been writing love letters my whole life. That gives roots,
and that gives you a very beautiful centering and a feeling of
earthliness. From there you have to start to grow, just like a tree. The
phenomenon of the tree is exactly similar to what I call my religion.
(BHAGWAN SPEAKS TO THE VIDEO CREW) Change it. There, you see? No
contract even with the film. In the middle of a sentence the film
changes... what to do?</p><p>A tree is exactly symbolic of what my religion is. The tree grows
roots deep under the earth. The deeper the roots go, the higher the tree
stands up. It is equal, proportionate. If the tree wants to reach to the
stars then the roots will have to reach to the very hell.</p><p>My commune is a very balanced phenomenon. There are more women than
men, for the simple reason that I am preparing the earth. Men are
coming. Soon you will see equal numbers. But they can come only, the
trees can grow upwards only, when the ground is ready. The woman is of
tremendous importance.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN PLAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The children are the commune's. They are not yours or mine. In the
first place my approach is that the world is already overpopulated, so
don't burden it anymore. And science has given you the greatest
revolution in human history, the pill, which makes you absolutely
capable of making love just a play, a fun, a game. There is no need to
be serious about it anymore. In the past, of course, people were
serious, because children will come, and who is going to take care of
the children? So first my emphasis is, remember, the earth is already
too burdened and we have to unburden it. So in four years' time, in my
commune not a single child has been born. Although four sannyasins have
died, we have not even replaced the four sannyasins with four
children.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN HOW MANY YEARS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In four years.</p><p>Secondly, there are children, because when sannyasins come, a few
sannyasins come with children. When they became sannyasins they were
already mothers and fathers. Those children are here, but the commune is
responsible. We remove the responsibility from father and mother. We
make them free, unburdened. Their children are there, they can love
them, they can live with them, they can go to them, they can call them,
but they belong to the commune. If they don't care about their children,
the children are not going to suffer in any way. The children have the
whole commune of uncles, aunts, and they go on making friends with
different kinds of people.</p><p>This is a tremendous education and a great preparation for a rich
life. It is an established fact that the boy loves his mother and the
girl loves her father. But this kind of love remains only in the mind.
The boy cannot make love to the mother. That is unimaginable. The boy
fantasizes but goes on repressing it, feels guilty. The girl feels
guilty. You can see small girls flirting with their fathers. It is
natural; he is the only man she knows from the very beginning.</p><p>This is a very significant thing, because the girl becomes impressed
with the idea of men according to the image she carries of her father.
And the same with the boy: his whole life he will remain frustrated. He
will not find the right woman</p><p>for the simple reason that it is always his mother that he is looking
for, unknowingly, unconsciously.</p><p>When he falls in love, he cannot say why he has fallen in love with
this particular woman, but psychologists know perfectly well. Something
in this woman resembles his mother -- perhaps the color of the hair, the
style of her dress, the way she walks, the sound of her voice, her eyes,
her face, her color -- anything. But something resembles the mother so
much that the boy has fallen in love. But the woman soon will not be
able to fulfill all the demands that the boy is going to make, that he
was making on the mother. And soon he is going to discover that she only
walks like his mother, but she is not the woman he was seeking,
searching.</p><p>In the commune we destroy this neurosis completely, because the child
goes on moving with many aunts, many uncles. And remember, father and
mother are later additions to language. Uncle and aunt are far more
ancient; because there was a time when there was no family, so everybody
of the age of the father was an uncle. Nobody knew exactly who was the
father.</p><p>I would like my commune's children not to be focused on one figure,
but to have a rich experience of many women, many men, so they have only
a general, vague feeling which can fit with any woman, any man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW WERE YOU RAISED? WERE YOU RAISED IN THE SAME WAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. How I could be raised in the same way? I had to fight for it.
I had to struggle for it. I was raised in a family, but the family never
thought that I belonged to them, because I never listened to them.</p><p>In fact I had made it clear that if they want me to do something they
should keep quiet. If they say they want me to do it, then I'm not going
to do it. Then I will do just the opposite, because I don't want to be
ordered in my life, and I don't receive anyone's commandments. I told
them, "If you want to throw me out of the house you can. This is your
house. Remember, I am born through you, but I have my own individuality
and I have to discover it on my own. Your orders will not help me."</p><p>Soon they became understanding, because how long could they fight?
And slowly they started understanding what I was saying. Now my mother
is a sannyasin. My father, who died a few years ago, died a sannyasin,
and before his death he told me, "We were trying to mold you, we were
trying to make you. Forgive us. If we had succeeded, we would have
destroyed something beautiful."</p><p>Q: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THEY FINALLY UNDERSTOOD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: When I came back from the university, then they had to understand
it, because their first thing was to get me married -- just the general
idea around the world, that if a person is married then his wings are
cut, he is chained. Then he</p><p>forgets all about revolutionary ideas, rebellion, those youthful
dreams of a better world, better humanity. Just chain him to
responsibility. He has a wife who nags him. He has children who are not
allowing him to sleep in the night, and he has a job where he never
reached in time because of those children and the wife. He forgets all
about revolution, a new man.</p><p>So that was their way. They thought that the first thing after I came
back from the university was to force me to get married.</p><p>Q: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED REBELLING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I must have been four years old when I started rebelling. Q:
FOUR?</p><p>A: Four.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S YOUNG.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is, yes, certainly young, but I was strong enough. I was even
ready to go and beg on the street, but not to be commanded, and not to
be forced to do anything.</p><p>Q: AT FOUR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Four.</p><p>Q: WAS THERE ANYONE THAT YOU ADMIRED WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes... a few people I admired, but very few people. I admired one
of my professors, for the simple reason that he had as much respect
towards me as I had for him. When I used to enter his room, he would
stand up to receive me. I would say, "This is not right, this is not
done." He said, "I don't do it for anybody, but somehow, the moment I
see you I cannot remain sitting. It feels embarrassing."</p><p>I loved the man. He was a gambler, a drunkard, but a very prominent
philosopher. Most of his years he was teaching in America. Only in his
old age he had come back home, and that was the time I entered the
university. He had just come back from Havana. We fell in love with each
other for the simple reason that he had been in rebellion his whole
life. His wife, his sons, his daughters were all in New Delhi. He never
lived with those people, only on holidays. He made it clear to them
that, "Too much time with you drives me insane, so I will be coming only
on holidays."</p><p>And then he found my ideas... because I was continuously arguing in
the class. I was not just a silent listener getting ready for the
examination. The examination never meant anything to me. Learning was my
purpose. And I said to him that the examination does not matter, what
matters is learning, so I have to argue if I see that something is
wrong, that something you are saying is illogical -- and on so many
points he found himself wrong. But he was a man of tremendous courage.
He accepted that he was wrong and I was right.</p><p>Slowly, slowly we became more and more close and intimate, so
intimate that one day he took all my luggage from the students' hostel
to his own house. He said, "You don't live outside, you live with me." I
said, "It will be a little difficult for you. For me it is just
beautiful -- so silent a place, and a beautiful bungalow with a
beautiful garden -- but for you it is going to be difficult."</p><p>And within three days he understood what I meant. After three days he
said, "You were right, because I want to drink, but I cannot drink
before you, I feel bad. I want to smoke, but I cannot smoke before you,
so in my old age I am hiding in the bathroom and smoking. You have
brought my childhood back. When you go to sleep, then I drink. I have to
keep my bottles hidden." I said, "I know everything, because when I see
cigarettes in the bathroom, and only we two persons are here, it is a
simple deduction who is smoking. I am certainly not smoking. And I know
that you are drunk; in the morning I see your hangover. So I know where
you are hiding your bottles; I have figured it out, because you go to
the university every day."</p><p>He was the head of the department of philosophy, and I was a rare
visitor. I was a student, but I visited the university very rarely, only
to some professors whom I liked. If their period was happening I would
go, otherwise I would remain in the house. So I explored the whole house
and I found out where he had been hiding the bottles. I said, "You don't
do this. Now it is becoming embarrassing to me. Just for me, you have to
smoke hiding, you have to drink like a thief. If you cannot smoke before
me, and cannot drink before me, I am leaving."</p><p>And you will be surprised: he said, "No, you don't leave. I will stop
smoking, I will stop drinking." He threw away all the cigarettes, the
best that he had brought from Havana. He poured all the wine that he had
brought from outside into the gutter, and he said, "Nobody has been able
to convince me. My doctors were against my smoking because my heart is
weak, my lungs are weak. My doctors were against drinking because I have
diabetes. But I never cared, I told those people, 'I may live two years
less, that does not matter, but I will live in freedom.' You never asked
me not to smoke. On the contrary, you told me, 'Smoke in front of me. If
you feel too embarrassed, I will start smoking with you. If you feel too
guilty drinking, I will share.'"</p><p>I loved that man. Only very few people I have found, but I was never
impressed by anybody. I have never followed anybody. I have met
remarkable men, but the more remarkable a man was, the more alert I was
not to be influenced, because I want to remain myself -- good, bad,
famous, notorious, but I want to be just</p><p>myself And I have retained my individuality, not even a dent on it. I
don't like even a dent on my car.</p><p>I was born just as everybody is born -- in families -- but with a
rebellious mind. And as far back as I remember -- that is four years old
-- I started asserting myself, slowly, and then it became absolute
assertion when they asked me to get married. I asked my father, "Are you
satisfied with your marriage? I have seen you being nagged by my mother
every day. You cannot even eat your meals peacefully... I have seen you
eating your meals, your eyes down, and the mother continuously hammering
you, because that is the only time she gets when you are at home,
otherwise you are in the shop. Do you want me also to be harassed by
another woman? You think it over."</p><p>I asked my mother, "Are you happy that you got married? Are you happy
that you have eleven children? Your whole life is wasted -- what have
you got out of it? -- not even a single moment of peace. So please,
before asking me to marry, think for fifteen days, and then, if you both
say so, I will get married. But remember, I am giving you a great
responsibility... my whole life." And that was really a great challenge
for them.</p><p>My father broke down within three days. He said, "I take my words
back. I will never again ask you to marry. I have suffered much, and I
know everybody is suffering." My mother took fifteen days -- naturally,
women are stronger, can resist anything longer than men -- but after
fifteen days she told me, "You forget about marriage. Our life is enough
proof, and we don't want you to get into the same trap. You be
yourself."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, BHAGWAN, THEN WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT MARRIED; WE KNOW YOU GET TO
EAT YOUR MEALS IN PEACE. HOW DO YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR DAY? DO YOU
MEDITATE A LOT? DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY?
WHAT DO YOU DO IN A TYPICAL DAY?</p><p>A: I do many things. One, I have always loved my bathroom -- the
bathtub, the shower. So, one and a half hours in the morning, one and a
half hours in the evening, three hours every day, I devote to my
bathroom -- that is my temple.</p><p>Q: WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO IN THE BATHROOM FOR THREE HOURS A DAY? OR
SHOULD WE NOT DISCUSS THAT ON VIDEOTAPE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just I enjoy sitting under the shower, lying down in my tub. I
change from hot, extreme hot, to extreme cold, freezing water. That is
immensely healthful to the body. One and a half hours is not long. It
goes so fast because I enjoy it so much. So three hours go into the
bathroom.</p><p>Two hours, or two and a half hours in the morning, I talk to my
disciples. Then in the night, two hours, just the way I am talking to
you, I talk to some journalist, some author. So four or five hours I am
talking.</p><p>Then I enjoy my food. I don't like to talk even, because whatever I
am doing, I want to do it totally. When I am eating, then I just want to
eat and relish every bite to the fullest. So one hour or one and a half
hours -- because I take two meals, lunch and supper -- and then I take,
before I go to sleep in the night, my whole life I have taken some
special sweets which are made only in Bengal, India. So in all, one and
a half hours goes to my food.</p><p>Two hours I sleep in the day. I have napped as long as I can
remember, and I love to sleep because to me sleep is just meditation, as
pure and as simple and as relaxing. And whatever time remains in the
night, I go to bed at about ten or eleven, it depends on the interview.
I wake up at six in the morning. I love sleeping on a king size bed -- I
love big things! (LAUGHTER)</p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN? WHAT DO YOU DO FOR RECREATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I go for a one-hour drive in one of the ninety Rolls Royces.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR TO SELECT ONE OUT OF NINETY, I
IMAGINE.…</p><p>A: So, one hour after my sleep in the afternoon -- I wake up at two
-- I go for a drive. My people have made a special road for me. Perhaps
I am the only man in the whole world who has a special road without any
traffic. It is used only for one hour in twenty-four hours. I love
driving, I have always loved it.</p><p>Then whatsoever time is left, I am sitting in my chair. I use only
one type of chair</p><p>-- this is the type -- I have many chairs of the same type, so
wherever I am, I am in the same type of chair. I have designed it
myself, and I have not found any other chair more comfortable than it
is. Then I simply relax with closed eyes. You can call it meditation. I
cannot call it meditation because to me meditation is now my very
nature. Not that I am doing anything, I am just sitting with closed
eyes, no ideas floating in my mind. Just utter silence.</p><p>My life is simple in a way, no complexity; in a way a very strict
routine, too. Every day at the same time in the morning I wake up, every
day at the same time in the morning I talk to my people -- and that's
how I go around the clock.</p><p>Q: DO YOU EVER GET BORED OR TIRED OF ROUTINE?</p><p>A: Never. For thirty-two years I have not experienced boredom. And I
don't see any hope that in the future I will have to experience boredom,
because I am never comparing. The same bath, the same bubbles, the same
pine fragrance... but it is the same only if you compare with your
yesterdays. I never compare anything with my yesterdays.</p><p>I can eat the same food for years. The sannyasins who cook my food --
they get bored cooking the same thing, they want to change. But if I
like something, I simply like it, and I like it every day. The same
thing for years creates no boredom in me because there is no comparison.
It is always fresh, and I am always excited.</p><p>You can ask Vivek, she is here. She brings my food, she takes care of
my clothes, my bed, my whole routine, that it goes exactly right. She
asks again and again, "We can change to some other sweet.…" I say,
"Wait. If I feel bored sometime, I will tell you." But I never feel
bored. If sometimes I change anything in my food, it is for her sake,
because she is getting so bored. And I am eating -- she is simply
bringing the plate. She is getting bored carrying the plate, it is human
-- so change it.</p><p>Q: HOW IS YOUR HEALTH? YOU SEEM TO BE LOOKING VERY WELL.</p><p><br></p><p>A: My health is very good and getting better. Oregon, its dry
climate, its hostile people, all have been tremendously helpful. I am
feeling very good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I REALLY HAVE -- UNLESS THERE IS
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD. IS THERE A MESSAGE, ANYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I would like to say that Oregon is so beautiful that the people
who live in Oregon should not behave in ugly ways. It is an insult to
this beautiful land. If you have such a beautiful land, it needs and
deserves beautiful people, too. So tell the people that I would like
them all to come and visit this place, and see that there is a different
way of living, too, without hostility, without antagonism, without
hatred, without crime. In four years' time, no crime has happened in
this commune, no woman has been raped, nobody has been murdered, nobody
has committed suicide.</p><p>People are so happy and relaxed and rejoicing, who wants to die? And
who wants to waste time quarreling, fighting, killing? Who wants to
steal? Their very blissfulness prevents them from everything the world
is full of.</p><p>My people work hard, but they call it worship. It is worship. Working
on the farm, digging the earth, if you are sensitive enough you will
feel it as worship. And if you feel it as worship, you will not get
tired. They work ten hours, twelve hours, whatever is the need -- it is
their responsibility -- and still nobody is complaining. Nobody is
saying that this is too much.</p><p>And these are not average, common people. There are Ph.D.s, D.Litt.s,
almost everybody is highly educated. Doctors are there, professors are
there, engineers are there, architects are there, legal experts are
there. Perhaps we have the biggest legal firm in the world: four hundred
sannyasins are legal experts. Everybody is doing, but nobody is being
coerced to do anything.</p><p>So tell the Oregonians: I love this land and I am not going to leave
this place.</p><p>Q: KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HUMAN NATURE, CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
SOME OREGONIANS MIGHT FEEL THREATENED BY YOUR PRESENCE HERE?</p><p>A: They are all -- not some -- almost ALL are threatened.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED, WOULD YOU PERHAPS NOT FEEL THREATENED
IF OREGON WERE YOURS AND A SMALL UNKNOWN GROUP CAME IN, WOULD YOU NOT
MAYBE FEEL THREATENED?</p><p>A: No. We don't feel threatened even when we are a small group. So it
is unimaginable that we own the whole Oregon and a small group is there,
and we feel threatened. We will enjoy that group, we will absorb that
group. We will not leave it alone, we will not be hostile to it. They
will be our guests.</p><p>And it is beautiful to have different kinds of people, strangers. It
gives richness. It is simply ugly that the same type of people, the same
churches, the same Bible... it makes life dull. I would like any small
group, there is no question of being threatened. One feels threatened
because one feels one is not happy where he is, what he is, and these
people are happy. Their dance is threatening. Otherwise, such a small
commune... what is the fear?</p><p>But just a few days ago, a secret document has been discovered and it
has been on television. The governor and all the big officials, the
secretary of state, the attorney general, the head of the police and all
the government agencies had a secret meeting. And the governor lied.
Because they did not allow any journalists in.…</p><p>This is ugly: in a democracy why should they try to hide things from
people? They did not allow any journalists, and the governor said, "I
will have a press conference after the meeting" -- and he lied in the
meeting. Everything he said was a lie.</p><p>Now that secret document has been found. He had the idea that it had
been destroyed -- perhaps he had ordered it to be burned, but somehow it
was not burned and somebody discovered it. The document says that in
that secret meeting they decided that the army should be put on alert,
against us; that the military should be ready. At any notice, within
three hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram.</p><p>So it is not a few Oregonians who are threatened.… I am simply amused
at the foolishness of this man, Governor Atiyeh. We are not a nation, we
don't have an army. You can simply throw a few bombs on the commune and
finish it. Just one airplane bringing half a dozen bombs -- small, old
fashioned bombs -- and that will do. You don't need an atom bomb. It is
not Hiroshima -- Hiroshima was big -</p><p>- it is not Nagasaki. And there is no need to waste so much money.
You can bring just any old-fashioned, out-of-date bombs and just finish
us.</p><p>But remember, while your bombs will be falling on us, we will be
dancing and singing. We will celebrate it. We celebrate everything. We
are celebrants.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW OLD ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am ancient.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD YOU BE A BIT MORE SPECIFIC?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Very ancient. You can see in me, in my eyes... you will see the
whole past of humanity. I am as old as existence itself -- because I
have always been here. I am part, just as you are part, of this
existence. And I have been in so many bodies that now I cannot get
identified with any body. When you have to change so many trains, you
are bound to feel that no train is yours; at the coming junction again
you have to change the train.</p><p>In this body I have been fifty-four years. But in fifty-four years I
have lived a life which is not possible to live even in two hundred
years. I have lived intensely, totally. Whatever I have been doing at
whatever time, I was doing it with my whole heart, as if the next moment
is death.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH? THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. YOU WILL
COME BACK IN ANOTHER BODY?</p><p>A: No.… No more. This time is the last time. I have been coming into
bodies again and again, but this time it is the last time. After
enlightenment, you cannot come back to the body. That is the only
disadvantage.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID YOU BECOME ENLIGHTENED? HOW OLD WERE YOU? WAS IT THIS
LIFE FOR YOU?</p><p>A: Yes. When I was twenty-one years old.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT OTHERS? WHAT ABOUT THE SANNYASINS: WHEN THEY DIE, WHEN
THEY LEAVE THIS LIFE, WILL THEY COME BACK AS HUMANS?</p><p>A: A few will not come. A few are bound to come. It all depends on
them. If they die unenlightened, they will have to come back. This is an
existential condition, that existence sends you back again and again and
again unless you have passed the examination. Enlightenment is the
examination. Then there is no question of coming back to the university
-- you have learned everything, experienced</p><p>everything. Your being dissolves into the whole, becomes one with it.
It is tremendous freedom. Being caged in a body is really carrying your
jail around you wherever you go. But as far as I am concerned, this is
the last time, so I am trying to make the most of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO THEN, IS THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED, SO THAT
WHEN YOU DO LEAVE THIS LIFE YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO CARRY AROUND THE
PRISON OF YOUR BODY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Right.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.</p><p>A: Good. Come back again.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-9>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 20.]</p><p>Swami Shanti Prabhu THE RAJNEESH TIMES RAJNEESHPURAM, OREGON</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT VIOLENCE IS AS AMERICAN AS
APPLE PIE. WHY IS THE UNITED STATES -- A COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF AS A
LAND OF FREEDOM -- SUCH A VIOLENT PLACE? IS THERE A RELATION BETWEEN
VIOLENCE IN AMERICA AND ITS SO-CALLED FREEDOM?</p><p>ANSWER: Violence in America has deep roots. It is the only continent
in the world which is being ruled by foreigners. The native red Indians,
to whom this continent belongs, are almost finished; and the people who
think they are Americans, none of them are American. They have all come
from other countries, invaded the poor country, invaded the poor
innocent natives. The roots of violence are there.</p><p>The people who had come into power over this continent through
violence have remained in power through violence. Unless the continent
is given back to its people, this violence is going to remain.</p><p>It is a strange phenomenon that the foreigners who are ruling the
country are trying to prevent others from living here. We are not trying
to rule the country. We are not invaders. They are trying to call us
foreigners just because they came here three or four generations ago.
Time makes no difference. They are all foreigners.</p><p>We not rulers. We have not invaded the country. We have not killed
its people. We have not destroyed its people's integrity and spirit. We
have purchased the land and we have purchased it for the right price. Do
you know how much the invaders paid the red Indians for the whole of New
York City? -- thirty dollars. The whole of New York was purchased for
thirty dollars. This is not purchasing, this is cheating innocent
people.</p><p>The people who came in the early days of America were really
criminals. They were thrown out of their countries, expelled. Those
criminals became presidents, became chief justices of the Supreme Court.
They were expelled from their own</p><p>countries for crimes which were so big that the countries could not
tolerate them. They would either kill them or throw them out.</p><p>Then people from Africa were forced, bribed, persuaded and given
great promises, hopes that they were going to a rich world where they
would receive all the facilities. What they found here was that they
were sold in the marketplace just like cattle. Slavery had disappeared
from the whole world, and it appeared just three centuries ago in
America. And the slaves, although no longer called slaves, still are not
first-class citizens.</p><p>This continent is based on violence. It has repressed the red Indians
in such ugly ways... it is difficult to imagine what man can do to man.
Red Indians are living almost in concentration camps. Of course, they
are not called concentration camps. They are called reservations,
especially reserved for red Indians.</p><p>Why should red Indians not be allowed to mix in society? It is their
land. They have lived here for thousands of years, but now they are
confined to forests and mountains, on reservations, and they are being
given pensions. On the surface it look humanitarian, as if we are ruling
over their continent and we are paying them. For generations we have
been paying them but to pay them salaries for no work is not
humanitarian.</p><p>What will they do with that money? They will get drunk; they will
take drugs. They will gamble; they will fight, kill each other. What
else do they have to do? Money comes without any effort. They will go on
creating more and more children because with each child comes more
money. To give people money without work is to reduce them into
drunkards, gamblers, murderers. You have taken their dignity.</p><p>On the surface everything looks so whitewashed, clean. It can be
claimed that you are giving them money because you are using their land.
But the real purpose is to keep them drunk, fighting, gambling, rowdy,
and to keep them in such a state that they never again think of being
free, that they never think of getting rid of all the invaders of this
continent.</p><p>The whole society is interwoven with violence. The black people are
downtrodden. There are thousands of people on the streets with no home.
What do you expect them to do? They will do every kind of crime, they
have nothing to lose. And America goes on pretending to the whole world,
that wherever there is any trouble, we are going to help. You can't help
your own people. Twenty-five percent of Americans who are able to work
are unemployed, and America goes to help Ethiopia!</p><p>In America, Ethiopia is spread everywhere -- just thinly, but it is
there -- and violence will come out. These people who have lost
everything, respect, humanity, integrity, they have been treated like
animals. You cannot expect the country to live without violence.</p><p>Basically, America is one of the greatest destructive powers in the
world. The whole government is working with only one object, to win the
third world war. But they are simply fools, because nobody can win the
third world war, neither</p><p>the Soviet Union nor America. The difference may be at the most ten
minutes. Whoever attacks first, it will take only ten minutes for the
other party to attack back. Nuclear weapons are ready on both sides, so
it is not a question of somebody getting defeated and somebody else
becoming victorious. It is simply suicidal. Both will be destroyed, and
with them all life on earth will be destroyed. If your great leaders,
political, religious and others, are bent upon having a third world war,
if all your scientific and military efforts are just aimed at one point
-- how to destroy the Soviet Union and how to destroy communism in the
world -- who are you to take responsibility for the whole world? Who are
you to decide that the Soviet Union should not be communist? It is none
of your business.</p><p>Your government is utterly violent. The whole structure of society is
violent. There are the superrich and there are the super-poor in this
country. The distance between the rich and the poor is too big.
Naturally, the poor man becomes violent -- he is angry. Your priests and
bishops go on teaching the poor to be contented, but how long do you
think you can keep them contented?</p><p>Now old strategies won't work. You have used this strategy for
thousands of years in the whole world, but it is not going to work in
America. It is a new country. It has only three hundred years'
civilization, which is nothing compared to countries like China or India
with histories of thousands of years.</p><p>This country is new and its poor have seen clearly that they have
been exploited. In India they have never seen it clearly -- they have
been exploited for thousands of years. They don't remember any time when
there was not poverty. They have accepted poverty as the law of nature,
the will of God.</p><p>But you cannot deceive the American poor. He has seen with his own
eyes that those who were cunning and clever have exploited him and
become rich. He has seen people who were criminals becoming rich; and he
has seen simple, innocent people who were not criminals becoming poor.
You cannot deceive the American poor. You cannot tell him that he is
suffering from his past lives' actions, because he knows perfectly well
that he is suffering from other Americans and their actions.</p><p>In such a small period of history -- three hundred years -- things
are very crystal clear. They had all come to America. They were all
equal. Nobody was rich, nobody was poor. Then, suddenly, a few people
started becoming richer and richer and richer, the richest in the world,
and a few people started falling down. They have seen with their own
eyes how one becomes rich. It is not by right means. It is by
exploiting, by cunning, by every kind of means -- good or bad does not
matter.</p><p>The American poor have a very different attitude from the poor in any
other country, because all those countries are very ancient. They don't
remember their beginnings; they don't know what happened in the
beginning so that a few people became poor and a few people became rich.
They think it has always been so. But the American poor have a unique
situation. They know what has happened. They cannot forgive it. They
cannot forget it. That brings violence.</p><p>Violence is the religion of America. And America is despised and
condemned all over the world -- even those countries receiving American
help are not sympathetic towards America. I know it. In India you will
not find a single person who is sympathetic towards America. And America
has been helping: whenever there is a famine or floods or no rain for
years, and people are dying, America is always ready to help. But
American help does not create sympathy for America. On the contrary, it
offends, because they know what you are doing to your own poor.</p><p>Why are you helping others when you yourself are not doing anything
for your own downtrodden? It is not compassion that you go on helping
Ethiopia, India, wherever there is poverty and sickness. It is an effort
to make ground for your armies, for your nuclear weapons. All those
countries understand perfectly that this is simply business, not
help.</p><p>America is the most condemned country in the whole world. America has
no friends anywhere, for the simple reason that it is the most
destructive power today. When your whole government and the energy of
the people and the intelligence of your scientists are moving in only
one direction -- destruction -- how can you avoid violence?</p><p>There is only one way, which is really difficult. Give the country
back to its native people. If they want you to remain here, you can
remain here, but you will have to remain on reservations. If you don't
want to live here, that is far better. Just go back to your own
countries.</p><p>Somebody is from England, somebody is from Spain, somebody is from
Portugal, somebody is from France, somebody is from Italy, somebody is
from Greece. The whole of Europe has to accept the responsibility to
take these people back. Give the country to its own people. If they
allow you to live here, you live, but you live under their rule, and
violence will disappear. I don't think red Indians can even imagine
about nuclear war.</p><p>When you are in power, and you are the greatest power in the world,
you are not going to be human, considerate. So it is not a simple
phenomenon, it is very complicated, and the violence has many aspects.
In America, more rapes happen than anywhere else. Strange. In a country
which is educated, rich, why should there be so many rapes? It is
because your priests go on talking stupidities to the people. They go on
talking about monogamy, they go on saying that if you are not married
any sexual relationship is sin.</p><p>I wonder how a marriage license transforms a sin into a virtue? Just
a license, a piece of paper, signed by a judge who may be committing
adultery himself. In fact, sometimes I wonder from where this word
adultery comes. It looks so simple -- any adult must be capable of it;
the moment you are capable of adultery you must be an adult. What other
meaning can it have? From where can it come? American women still are
not free. Protests go on happening in the name of liberation, but the
woman is not free, not equal. The woman is angry, and her anger is
turning into a perversion. The American woman is educated enough.</p><p>You cannot keep her repressed like the women of the East, of Arabia,
who are uneducated, not knowing anything about the world. The American
woman is educated. If you want her to be a dependent partner in a
marriage, she would rather move into lesbianism than become a slave of
man. In America there are more lesbians than in any other country, and
naturally, when women become lesbians, men start becoming
homosexuals.</p><p>These are all different shapes of violence. Your priests are
responsible, your politicians are responsible. Do you know what happened
in Vietnam? You forced your young people to fight there without
understanding the fact that they are not soldiers as they exist in other
countries. They were educated, highly qualified, and you forced them to
kill innocent, poor Vietnamese for no reason.</p><p>Who are you to interfere in the whole world? You want to put your
nose in everywhere? It is Vietnam's decision whether it wants to be
communist or not.</p><p>And what happened there? Thirty percent of the American soldiers did
not kill anybody. They could see that this American violence was
absolutely ugly, uncalled for. They could see that the poor Vietnamese
have difficulty to arrange even two meals every day and you are bombing
them, destroying their houses, burning their houses.</p><p>Many American soldiers went insane for the simple reason that they
could not believe that this was what their country stands for. Many of
the American soldiers had to be treated psychologically when they came
back home from Vietnam; they were so much disturbed they had to be
rehabilitated psychologically. They were not like other countries'
soldiers -- uneducated, unaware of what is going on -- who when they
come home, come with great pride. The American soldiers came back home
with guilt and, you may or may not know, many who were in Vietnam have
never moved back into American society. They are hiding in jungles and
mountains, in Alaska, living a very primitive life.</p><p>Many of them have been approached by their families and friends to
come back home. They said, "We are finished with home, country, nation,
flag, American Constitution, democracy, all that nonsense. Just leave us
alone. We would like to live here in complete isolation. At least we
will not feel guilty. We will not be forced to do something violent,
unnecessarily. Back home, they're going to put us back into the army,
prepare us again for the third world war. We are not going." There are
hundreds of young American men who were professors, doctors, engineers,
living in the forest like primitive people, in caves. They don't want to
come back to America for the simple reason that this whole society is
basically wrong. It is based in violence. Twenty percent of American
presidents have been murdered. This is a record! In no other country has
this happened. Once in a while a person may be murdered, but not twenty
percent of the presidents. And if the president is so much unprotected
-- remember, the American president is the most protected man in the
world -- if the most protected man in the world</p><p>can be killed by his own people, who else can be at ease? Even the
president is not at ease. Every moment, violence!</p><p>It is not something superficial. If we want to change the violent
structure of America, there are three things to be done. One, the
country should be ruled by its native people. It belongs to them.
Anybody who wants to remain here should remain here, but he cannot
remain here as a ruler. Secondly, America should stop bothering about
other countries' poor people. It should help its own poor people.
Thirdly, America should stop piling up nuclear weapons. They are
pointless, and so costly, so meaningless. You already have enough to
destroy the whole world, what more do you want?</p><p>America should declare, "We drop the whole idea of war. We destroy
all our nuclear weapons. We drown all those weapons in the Pacific, in
the Atlantic. We're finished with it." America should declare, "We will
not have any defense department any more -- it is just pointless."</p><p>If America can do that, its people can be immensely rich, happy. And
people who are happy do not do violence. It is out of misery, suffering,
anger, that violence comes. When you are comfortable, happy, at home,
and all that you need is available to you, you don't want to be violent
-- because your being violent will destroy your cozy home, your
beautiful surroundings, your love life. Your children, your wife, your
parents will be lost. It is the people who have nothing to lose who
become violent. And one cannot say to them, "Don't be violent."</p><p>I, personally, cannot say to them, "Don't be violent." On what
grounds can I say it? They have been cheated of all that a man needs,
and if they are revengeful, it seems logical. America should take care
of itself Then unemployment is impossible, everybody can be comfortably
rich. You just have to stop piling up nuclear weapons, and you can make
this country actually, literally a new world by declaring that you are
not going to defend.</p><p>Defense is meaningless. Even with all your nuclear weapons you can be
destroyed, so what is the point of having all those nuclear weapons? It
is a very strange fact that in the past weapons were significant; now
they are not, but idiotic politicians go on following past policies of
politics. They don't understand that the whole thing has changed.</p><p>Only a nation which is not burdened by the past can become the first
nation in the world to declare, "We are no longer a separate entity. We
are open and available to the whole world. We declare that we are not
enemies to anybody. We declare friendship to be our basic policy, and we
are ready to lose everything rather than be violent."</p><p>If these three things can be done, it won't harm America in any way.
It would give America prestige, pride. America would gain sympathy from
all over the world. America would become the beginning of the new world.
Other nations would follow just as they are following America now. They
are starting to make nuclear plants, atomic plants; if America stops it,
they will stop it too.</p><p>And the whole world now has become free. The British Empire has
disappeared. Only America has not been capable of freeing the people who
are the real owners of this country. Give it back to them. You have
reduced them to such a situation that they cannot even struggle for
freedom. They are doped, drugged. They are almost asleep. They cannot
fight for freedom, they don't know what freedom is. And they don't want
it either, because this is going so well: no work, and money is
available; no work, and alcohol is available; no work, and all drugs are
available. Even those drugs which are prohibited to other people are
available to the red Indians, to destroy them, to destroy their
spirit.</p><p>I say these three things: the land has to go back to the real owners
-- those who are capable of living here under the red Indians as rulers
can remain, otherwise they should go back to their own country; America
has to stop all interference with other countries, and put its whole
energy into changing the conditions of the poor, of the blacks, of the
women; and third, it has to drop the very idea of war, to become the
first country in the history of the world to drop war, defense
departments, armies, to become a precedent -- for others to follow.…</p><p>I am perfectly convinced that if America can do that, soon other
countries would have to follow, would certainly follow, because they are
also suffering. Under the pressure of war effort, their whole economies
are going down and down. But out of fear they cannot stop creating more
weapons.</p><p>These simple things just need a little understanding, and America can
open a new dimension for the whole of humanity.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID THERE IS NO GOD, ONLY GODLINESS; AND THERE
IS NO RELIGION, ONLY RELIGIOUSNESS. IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A MASTER,
OR IS IT MASTERLINESS? PLEASE EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no such thing as a Master, but there is certainly
something you can call masterliness. Everybody cannot manage -- even all
the people who have become enlightened have not been Masters.</p><p>To be a Master, different qualities are needed than just
enlightenment. You can become enlightened and perhaps nobody will ever
know about it. To give the message you have got, you need to be
articulate, immensely articulate, because you are going to do something
which is almost impossible -- you are going to transform the experience
of silence, wordlessness, into words.</p><p>You have to be a charismatic personality so that people are
automatically attracted towards you. No need for advertisement: mouth to
mouth, people start hearing about you, that something immense has
happened to a man... and not only that, the man is capable in some
strange way to relate it to you. Through words, through silence, just by
his presence, just by looking into your eyes, just holding your hand,
something transpires. Something starts happening to you which you have
never thought about, never dreamed about.</p><p>Yes, there is a certain quality which makes a man a Master. But I say
that there is no need of a Master because people in their ignorance, in
their unconscious state, start becoming dependent on the Master. He
becomes a father figure, and that is where everything goes wrong. He
himself unknowingly destroys what he is doing.</p><p>I am here with you, and I say that I am not your Master and you are
not my follower -- and you know perfectly well, I know perfectly well,
that I am your Master and you are my follower. But I go on insisting
that you are not my follower and I am not your Master -- you are my
fellow travelers -- just so that you don't become dependent on me, just
so that you don't start thinking it is my responsibility; you need not
be worried: the Master is there, he will take care, he is the savior. He
will save you, you need not do anything.…</p><p>No, I want you to be responsible. I want you to take all your
responsibility on yourself. I can impart whatsoever has happened to me,
and it is no obligation to you. I am not obliging you; I am simply
enjoying sharing.</p><p>To have enlightenment is tremendous bliss, but it is nothing compared
to sharing it. When one starts seeing the same flame in thousands of
eyes, the same luster and glory around thousands of faces, no
enlightenment can be compared to it. It transcends all bliss that you
have known in enlightenment. That was an individual affair, small; a
window had opened and you had looked through the window. The sky, the
stars... but the frame of the window was there. Your experience was
framed. You have never been out of the house, so naturally you will
deduce that this is the sky -- the frame of your window.</p><p>Yes, you are seeing real stars and the real sky, but you are
confined, limited. Your window is giving a frame to your experience. If
you want to share with others, you will have to come out, you will have
to seek people with whom you can share. You will have to go and knock on
many doors to find people who are almost ready to receive it. And when
you go out of the house searching for seekers and disciples, then you
know the whole sky, the infinity of it, the unlimited number of stars.
Now you know that sky you had seen was framed.</p><p>There is no frame, there is no boundary to existence. Sharing your
enlightenment, you come to know there is no boundary to enlightenment,
either. It is not yours or mine, it is existential.</p><p>This I call transcendence of enlightenment. This is the moment when
the enlightened person becomes ordinary: he has transcended even that
speciality of being enlightened. Now he is at ease with himself and his
ordinariness.</p><p>But this ordinariness has an immense impact of its own, it has the
charisma I am talking about. It makes the man a magnetic force. He
becomes the very center of the whole existence, and all those who are in
search -- even groping in darkness -</p><p>- start moving towards him. But don't give it a frame. When you call
it a Master, you have given it a frame. Let it remain a quality --
masterliness.</p><p>There is no God, there is godliness. There is no religion, there is
religiousness. There is no Master, there is only mastery, masterliness.
And as the Master</p><p>becomes a quality, immediately the disciple becomes a quality. Then
there is no disciple, only discipleship.</p><p>Discipleship is a totally different thing. Disciplehood, or to come
to the exact right word, discipline. The word discipline means learning,
the process of learning. There is no disciple, no learner, but there is
a process of learning.</p><p>There is no Master who teaches you, but there is a Master -- being
who shares that which he has found. And his treasure is infinite,
inexhaustible.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, IN THE PAST, MONARCHS, STATESMEN AND POLITICIANS ALWAYS
LOOKED TOWARD THE WISE ENLIGHTENED MEN FOR THEIR ADVICE IN AFFAIRS OF
STATE. WOULD IT BE A BOON TO MANKIND IF RONALD REAGAN SOUGHT YOUR
ADVICE? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In the first place, the politicians of today are not so wise as
some emperors in the past have been. The emperor was born, so sometimes
there were idiots who became emperors, mad, crazy people who became
emperors. Once in a while, there was a person who was wise enough and
yet became an emperor. Augustus in Rome and Ashoka in India were such
emperors. They went to seek advice. They knew there were people who knew
much more; they knew there were people whose word is truth.</p><p>But today's presidents and prime ministers are going to be just
third-rate cunning politicians. It is impossible for a wise man to
become the president of a country, for the simple reason that he is
wise. He cannot lie, he cannot give you promises which he knows can
never be fulfilled.</p><p>He will tell you things which will hurt you. Just think of me: in the
first place I cannot run for the presidency of a country, because I
don't like running. I can drive in my Rolls Royce, so my campaign for
the presidency will not be running for president, but driving for
president.</p><p>My whole life I have been practicing a certain art: how to influence
people and create enemies. This is not a way to become a president or a
prime minister. No wise man can even think of it, because he cannot
fulfill the basic conditions of a politician.</p><p>And you are asking me that if a president -- for example, Ronald
Reagan -- came here for my advice, would I give it to him? Of course. If
I can give advice to you all, why can't I give advice to Ronald Reagan?
But he will have to come not as a president, but as a disciple, because
unless you come to learn, I cannot teach you. If he comes as a
president, he cannot get an appointment from Sheela; but if he comes
just as a human being he is welcome. Any politician from any country is
welcome, but he should come just as a human being; otherwise it is
useless, wasting my time and wasting his time.</p><p>So from my side, I am clear. But your question is only "if" -- you
should not forget. No president is going to come. No president has the
guts to come. It is my</p><p>whole life's experience, I am not just saying something without any
support from my experience.</p><p>I knew Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India,
personally. He was a man of great aesthetic, poetic qualities, but still
he had not the guts to accept my advice.</p><p>He said, "You are right, but you don't know this dirty politics. If I
start doing things the way you are suggesting, I will simply lose my
premiership. I will not be able to do what you are saying -- I will just
lose my power, my prestige. I will look crazy. And I say to you that
what you are saying is right."</p><p>His successor, Lalbahadur Shastri, was immensely interested in me. He
died with one of my books on his chest. He was reading it and must have
fallen asleep, had a heart attack, and died. He was in Tashkent, Russia,
for a summit meeting -- the American and Russian presidents, the
Pakistani president, and he. These four were there to settle matters
about Kashmir, because a part of Kashmir was occupied by Pakistan.</p><p>Pakistan's army had been standing ready there for almost forty years.
The Indian army was ready -- confronting Pakistan's army for forty
years. And the UNO's representative army was just standing in between at
the cease-fire line. Now, how long is it going to be there, this
cease-fire line? Forty years is too long a time. They had gone to settle
it, but Shastri died.</p><p>He lived just to be the prime minister for one year. He was very
simple in a way, and it was by chance that he was chosen prime minister.
No one could have thought that he could win the race, but in the
political game it sometimes happens. He was the most unexpected
candidate.</p><p>The commanding, ruling party of the country was very much afraid of
Morarji Desai because he was the most stubborn type of person. Once he
became the prime minister, he would not care a bit about the committee
who had chosen him. The committee was afraid to choose him for the
simple reason that they knew that man. Once he had power in his hands,
he wouldn't care even about those who had given him power.</p><p>So on the one side was Morarji Desai, on the other side was Indira
Gandhi. They were afraid to choose Indira Gandhi because in the whole
political atmosphere there was the idea that India is not a democracy,
but a monarchy. Jawaharlal was the first prime minister; now his
daughter will be the second prime minister. They wanted to avoid Indira,
because turning it into a family affair would bring condemnation to all
of them and would make the opposite parties more powerful.</p><p>And certainly it has turned into a family affair. After Indira, her
son became the prime minister. For forty years one family has been
ruling, except for that one year when Lalbahadur was chosen.</p><p>He was chosen because he was a very simple and weak person. The
committee knew perfectly well that even if he were the prime minister,
they would remain</p><p>the masters, the kingmakers. He would be only a puppet. Whatever they
wanted, he would do.</p><p>Morarji Desai could not be chosen. He wanted to be chosen; he was
forcing the committee -- "I am the most experienced, the most senior
person, why are you not choosing me?" Against him was standing Indira
Gandhi. She had her reasons: she had lived with her father, she had seen
the whole freedom struggle, its problems. She had seen the beginnings of
the independence of India, its complexities, its problems. She knew
every in and out of all the politicians of the country. Nobody else had
such knowledge.</p><p>She claimed that Morarji Desai might be senior, but that he knew
nothing about all the chief ministers of the states, all the governors.
He knew nothing. She had all the files of her father and his whole
experience, and she had been living with him. She knew everybody -- who
was dependable, who was not, who was reliable, who was not, who was
certain to betray the country.</p><p>Both had their claims, but the committee persuaded Lalbahadur. He was
a very small-sized man, and he was very afraid: "Forgive me, I cannot
manage, I am a simple man. " He had never been in the public eye, he was
not a national figure.</p><p>Just because Jawaharlal loved him for his sincerity, truthfulness,
reliability, he was in the supreme commanding committee of the ruling
party. Jawaharlal had put him there.</p><p>The committee unanimously chose Lalbahadur. It sometimes happens. He
was</p><p>very available to me, but even he was not courageous enough to come
to see me. He managed a lunch, in a political way, in the house of one
of his cabinet ministers.</p><p>This man, Karan Singh, was interested in me -- he was the king of
Kashmir, and because Kashmir became dissolved into India, he was
immediately taken into the cabinet. Naturally he had to be given
something; he was the first to join India and give his whole country to
the union. He was very much interested in me, so Lalbahadur said, "This
would be good. You call him and me for lunch, so just casually we meet
and discuss. My going to him will be dangerous to my career." And he
confessed it to me that this is how diplomacy works. Nobody knows --
just a casual, accidental meeting. And before lunch, after lunch, for
almost three hours he was listening to me about every problem that he
was facing.</p><p>But I told him it would be good if he came to my place and lived a
few days with me. Everything could be cleared. He said, "That is
impossible. If people come to know that I have gone to you for advice, I
am finished. You have so many enemies in the country, in my party, in my
cabinet, that I cannot take that risk. And I am simply a weak manI have
been chosen for my weakness." But he was sincere.</p><p>Indira, the third prime minister of India, was very much interested
in me, but not courageous enough to come to Poona. She was continuously
telling Laxmi, "I want to see Bhagwan, I want to come. And next time
when I come to Bombay or anywhere nearby, I am going to come to the
ashram.</p><p>And she came twice to Poona itself, but she never could gather
courage to come to the ashram. Political fear.… Just to be associated
with a man like me needs courage, because all those who are my enemies
will become your enemies. And all those who are your friends may stop
being your friends just because you are associated with me.</p><p>The last time she came to Poona, she told Laxmi, "This time,
whatsoever happens I am going to manage and come." But when Laxmi went
to see her, she said, "There are so many engagements, I cannot find
time."</p><p>And this was a lie -- because she went to Kohlapur, four hours
driving, to meet the shankaracharya, the head of the Hindus, like the
pope is the head of the Catholics. She found time to go to the
shankaracharya -- four hours going, four hours coming, and just two
minutes to touch the feet of the shankaracharya. But that was
politically helpful. Thousands of Hindus had gathered for the
shankaracharya. He was an old man from the south, very much respected by
the Hindus because he was absolutely fulfilling all their demands of how
a religious person should be. He was an ascetic, a masochist -- those
were the qualities that Hindus were asking. Intelligence has never been
asked. Scholarship, yes -- he could recite Hindu scriptures without
reading; he knew them by rote. He was very much respected and he was
very old, eighty or eighty-five.</p><p>Now Indira lied that she had no time; but the reality is that she had
no courage -- even to meet the person who was the only one who supported
her when she was defeated and lost her premiership. The whole country
was against her, it was a tremendous defeat, and when she stood in a
by-election, I was the only man to bless her. No shankaracharya blessed
her, not even Vinoba Bhave, who was her political guru, blessed her. Now
they were afraid that to bless her means to lose many friends.</p><p>She went to the shankaracharya again to get his blessings. He did not
speak a word. She was told that he had taken silence for the day. This
was simple diplomacy: if he has taken silence, good; when she touches
his feet he can bless her with the hand -- that is not breaking your
silence. But no, he remained sitting just like a statue -- because it
was a problem for him too. If he blessed Indira, then all the Hindus who
were against Indira would be against him. It is a simple rule. The enemy
of your enemy is your friend.</p><p>So I would like to say to you that your question is only if. Ronald
Reagan cannot come, cannot have the courage. But from my side I have no
ifs, no buts. If he wants to come, he is welcome; but he has to remember
that here he is not the president, that he has come here to seek advice,
to learn something. He has to be here like a disciple. If that much
humbleness is there, then certainly my advice can reach to his heart.
Otherwise, it is meaningless.</p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>The Last Testament, Vol 1</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;line-height:17pt;text-align:left id=chapter-10>Chapter #10</h1><h1 style=padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-my-work-has-just-begun-27-july-1985-pm-in-jesus-grove>Chapter

Volume 1, as Chapter 21.]</p><p>Ma Anand Rose</p><p>DIE RAJNEESH TIMES COLOGNE,</p><p>WEST GERMANY</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, NO COUNTRY, NOT EVEN AMERICA, IS AS UPSET AS THE
GERMANS AT YOUR PRESENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY, AND AT YOUR INFLUENCE ON
INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE PEOPLE. THEY ARE TRYING HARD TO SEE YOU AS
ANOTHER HITLER. WHAT DOES THAT TELL ABOUT THE GERMAN MIND, FORTY YEARS
AFTER HITLER'S DEATH?</p><p>Answer: The ghost of Adolf Hitler, his long shadow, is still present.
And Adolf Hitler is not something that you can confine to one person. It
is something deep down in the German mind itself. Adolf Hitler would not
have existed if the German mind had not been supportive of him. And not
only ordinary people -- who can be easily influenced, impressed -- but
many exceptional people: geniuses like Heidegger, who is certainly the
most important philosopher of the twentieth century, he was a follower
of Adolf Hitler.</p><p>What these people were seeing in Adolf Hitler was something that was
in themselves. In Adolf Hitler it was magnified. In themselves they
could not see it, but Adolf Hitler became the mirror; they could see it,
and he became the representative of the collective unconscious mind of
Germany. Hence, the influence that he had.</p><p>Although forty years have passed, the German mind is still the same.
And when they see my influence on people they become afraid, for the
simple reason that if I can influence so many young intelligent German
people, I can paint the whole of Germany red. And Germany has suffered
through Adolf Hitler's influence so much, the wound is still there and
it hurts. They don't know much about me. All they know is that thousands
of young Germans are ready to die for me. To their knowledge, this
phenomenon had happened only with Adolf Hitler. In the same way,
thousands and thousands of people were ready to die for him, to do
anything for him. So they see a certain similarity. But there is no
similarity at all. I teach people to live for me, not to die for me. I
teach people to dance for me, not to die for me. All your so-called
great leaders of the world have told their people that they should be
ready to die for them. That was thought to be something of</p><p>great pride. And certainly millions have died for idiots. They died,
they killed, all kinds of neurosis was released by these so-called
leaders.</p><p>I am not a leader. I am not a politician. I insist to my people to
live long, to live happily, to rejoice. Even if I die, celebrate it.
Nobody has ever said to his people, "When I die you rejoice and
celebrate, sing and dance." In thousands of years not a single man has
been there to say this. They were just saying, "Be ready. If you love
me, be ready to die for me, because we are going to conquer lands,
conquer the whole world. If you are not ready to die for me, you are a
coward, and then how are you going to conquer the world?"</p><p>I have a different way of conquering the world. I don't need nuclear
weapons, atom bombs. I have a different approach totally. And they have
all failed. None of them could conquer the whole world, neither
Alexander the Great, nor Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf
Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mussolini, nor Mao Tse-tung. They all have,
without exception, failed, because this is not the way to conquer. Hate
is not the way to conquer. It will destroy the other, and in consequence
it will destroy you too. Your victory is going to be just a very passing
phase.</p><p>I say to my people: Yes, we are going to take over the world -- by
our rejoicing, by our love, by our peace, serenity, by our meditation.
We are not politicians. We are not going to rule them. In fact, we are
going to teach everybody not to be ruled by anyone and not to rule
anyone. Only then are you really an authentic human being.</p><p>My influence on German people is exactly the opposite of Adolf
Hitler's. But influence is there, and those who don't know me can find a
certain similarity. Those who know will find that the influence is
there, in fact it is far greater than Adolf Hitler's.</p><p>And it is not me who is saying it. One of the most important Western
journalists, author of many significant books, Aubrey Menen, wrote a
book almost ten years ago about the new mystics. He put my picture on
the cover. The book was published by Thames and Hudson in London. What
he said inside, even I could not believe. He said, "I have seen Adolf
Hitler, interviewed Adolf Hitler, I have listened to Adolf Hitler in a
meeting sitting in the front row, and I have seen his tremendous
influence on people, but it is nothing compared to Bhagwan." His
influence, he says, was only that of oratory, there was no substance in
it. Those people were enchanted because their egos were fulfilled. He
was saying to those people that you are the highest race amongst human
beings. You are the purest Nordic Aryans. It is your birthright to rule
all over the world.</p><p>Naturally, all those who had ambitions, ego trips, were influenced.
Here is a man who can manage to fulfill their hidden desire. They
themselves, of course, cannot manage, it is too big. Aubrey Menen says
that people were influenced, but that influence was something sick. It
was fulfilling their egos.</p><p>The people who are influenced by me are totally different. I am
making every effort to destroy your ego. And to destroy the German ego
is the hardest thing!</p><p>In fact the intelligent, German, young generation is influenced by me
against Adolf Hitler and against any possibility of Adolf Hitler ever
happening again in Germany. I am the greatest enemy of Adolf Hitler's
anywhere. And any country which is influenced by me, particularly the
young generation -- I don't care about the graveyards, I only trust the
young blood, fresh blood -- if they are in love with me, that means
Adolf Hitler is impossible, destruction is impossible. And it is true
about other countries too.</p><p>If all over the world the intelligent young people become attuned
with me, fall in love with me, not only Adolf Hitler but even the third
world war is impossible. To create a third world war you will need all
kinds of geniuses, talented people, young. And if they have in some way
fallen in love with me, they are not going to serve any destructive
cause at any price. They are going to simply refuse.</p><p>My influence is diametrically opposite to Adolf Hitler. The older
generation may be afraid. They have seen Adolf Hitler, they have seen
his great influence, they have seen people becoming almost mad after
him. And he himself was a retarded mind. He himself was not intelligent
at all, just a third-rate person. He was refused admission to schools,
colleges. He was refused admission to the university -- he wanted to
learn architecture. Then, seeing everywhere rejection -- nobody could
think him capable of anything great -- he joined the army.</p><p>That was the last resort of all the idiots, of all the fools, of all
the stupid minds. The army is the last resort: you don't need
intelligence. In fact, intelligence is a barrier in becoming a good
soldier. Just as a retarded person cannot become a sannyasin, an
intelligent person cannot become a soldier. What does it mean to become
a soldier? It means you have accepted death as your profession. You
don't have any sensitivity for what you are doing. For a little salary
and employment you have accepted to murder innocent people, children,
women, old people who have done no harm to you, to whom you are not even
introduced.</p><p>This needs something of a very low kind of person, almost the animal.
Physically he looks like a human being, mentally he is not. And these
people have fought all the wars. Of course, when you want to kill people
you have to be ready to be killed any moment. They have not only sold
their intelligence and their freedom into the hands of some dictator,
for just a little employment they have become murderers. And
simultaneously they have accepted for that little salary to be suicidal
also, because in war it is not necessarily so that you will only kill
and you will not be killed.</p><p>So those leaders were emphasizing, "Be ready to kill or be killed.
The stake is great: the nation's pride, the race and its ego, the
religion and its messiah." All these people have been teaching you just
death, either somebody else's or your own.</p><p>I am simply amazed when people start comparing me with people who are
absolutely opposite to me. In anything, my influence is to live more, to
allow others to live more, to love more, to allow others to love more.
Let this whole</p><p>earth become a celebrating planet. There is no reason to kill and be
killed, and just for some fool like Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph
Stalin. If they want, they can commit suicide, they can hang themselves
from any tree, but why spread this poison? They spread this poison
because it fulfills their ego. The name of the nation, race, religion is
just a facade, just a curtain, a mask. Behind it is some monster who
looks like a human being. My message is for love, life, laughter.</p><p>But not only in Germany, everywhere there is fear, because it has
always happened that whenever there was a man of charismatic influence
who can attract people so much that they become identified with him,
there has always been difficulty. That's why, because of their past
experience, they are afraid. All over the world there is great fear. And
the strange thing is, their fear is absolutely baseless.</p><p>I am a totally new kind of man, the beginning of a new humanity. But
I can understand them. They have only their past, and their past is
long, and their experience is wrong. And whenever there has been a man
of influence, he has created trouble. Adolf Hitler created the second
world war. Now they are afraid; if their younger generation is being
influenced by me and is ready to do anything that I say, naturally fear
arises. Again the same situation may happen. But just tell them, with me
it cannot happen. Without me it can happen.</p><p>They are so afraid in Germany that perhaps sometime I may be coming
to visit my communes, they have already put a bogus law case against me.
Just in case I want to enter the country I can be immediately arrested.
I have never been in Germany and I have never done anything in Germany.
But they can file a case against me.</p><p>That case will help them in many ways. First, they can refuse my
entry. Secondly, they can allow me to enter but refuse to let me out of
the country. Thirdly, as long as the case is not finished, they can
force me to remain there. And they can put other cases. If I win in one
case, they can put another. There is no problem in it. Somebody simply
goes to the court and says that what Bhagwan has said hurts my religious
feeling. That is enough.</p><p>It is a very strange world in which we are living. If your religious
feeling is hurt, then it is your problem; get treated, or drop that
religion which cannot help you to be strong enough not to be hurt by a
small criticism from anybody. And if your heart, your religious feelings
are disturbed, that simply shows they are superficial. You need a new
religion which goes deep to your roots and nobody can hurt you. Can any
of my people be hurt? None of my people have gone to the courts, filing
cases, and had their religious feelings hurt.</p><p>I have been condemned all over the world, in all the newspapers, in
all the media. They have called me all kinds of names. You could have
easily gone to court. In every country you could have fought that your
religious feeling is hurt, but none of my people has even thought about
it. They simply laughed and ignored it. Filing a lawsuit means giving
attention to idiots. And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying
without any argument. They have no argument.</p><p>In India once there was a case against me -- of a similar type --
that I have hurt the religious feelings of Hindus. That is enough in any
country. This is very strange. And why was the case accepted by the
court? It went for almost one year and I had to come back to Ahmedabad
again and again for that case. They were simply wasting my time, and the
case was utterly stupid.</p><p>Speaking in Ahmedabad, amongst fifty thousand people, I had said that
Mahatma Gandhi used to listen to the story of Rama every day. Vinoba
Bhave, one of his disciples, but a very scholarly person, used to read
the Ramayana, the story of Rama. It is read in every house in India. The
drama of Rama is played in every town, city, village, every year. Rama
is in every Hindu heart's center.</p><p>I said in the meeting that Vinoba was reading the story of Rama, and
there comes a passage where Rama's wife, Sita, is stolen. Just to leave
some clues as to what direction she has been taken, she went on throwing
her ornaments on the way. Indian women have many ornaments, and she was
a queen, so she had enough ornaments. And it was bound -- she felt it
was certainly logical -- that Rama would find these ornaments and they
would give him a clue to the direction, and if he found more, that made
it more certain. If he found more he could reach to where she was being
taken.</p><p>And he found -- precious diamonds, emeralds, rubies.… He asked his
brother Laxmana, "Do you recognize? Are these ornaments my wife's? I
cannot recognize them myself because whenever I am with Sita, she is so
beautiful that I get lost into her. I don't pay attention to her
ornaments, so I cannot be certain that this ornament belongs to her. But
in this thick forest, who is going to throw rubies and diamonds and
ornaments made of all kinds of precious stones? Laxmana, perhaps you can
find." Laxmana said, "Please forgive me, because I have never seen Sita,
except her feet, because I used to touch her feet every morning." Your
elder brother's wife in India is thought to be equal to your mother.
"And I have never seen her face, I have never seen above her feet. Yes,
if we come across the ornaments she used on her feet, I will recognize
them immediately."</p><p>Gandhi was a little puzzled. He said to Vinoba, "I don't understand.
First, I cannot understand Rama, that he lived for so many years and he
could not recognize the ornaments of his own wife. But perhaps he was
still on his honeymoon. Sita may have been very enchanting -- but why
Laxmana never saw Sita?" Vinoba produced an argument -- which is not in
the story, the argument is Vinoba's -- he produced an argument that
Laxmana never saw Sita's face because he wanted to remain celibate. He
wanted to remain unimpressed by Sita's beauty because he was under a
strict discipline. And Gandhi accepted the idea that it was because of a
strict discipline; that Sita was so beautiful, perhaps looking at her he
may get passionately interested in her.</p><p>Gandhi accepted the idea. Not only that, it was because of this
argument he gave Vinoba the title of Acharya. Acharya means the master
mind. He said, "The explanation that you have given makes you a master.
I could not have conceived that this would be the explanation."</p><p>I told this whole thing to the people, fifty thousand people -- and
they were all Hindus, followers of Rama, followers of Gandhi, followers
of Vinoba -- and I told them that Laxmana's explanation is ugly. It
simply shows that he was afraid to see the face. This fear is already
part of desire and passion. He was perfectly aware that if he saw her,
he would like to have her. All this must have been going on in his mind.
He must have been dreaming of Sita, because it was not that he had never
seen her. Before the marriage, Laxmana and Rama both had gone to see
her.</p><p>In those days in India, the king's daughters used to have a certain
ceremony. It was called swayamvara. The princess chooses her husband by
a certain device. Sita was the daughter of a very big emperor. Hundreds
of kings had come to marry her. The device was that Sita's father had
one very long bow, which was known as "Shiva's bow." And the condition
was that anybody who could just by hand break the bow into pieces, he
would be the person to marry Sita.</p><p>The bow was so heavy that many kings tried to take it up from the
platform, but they fell themselves. They could not move the bow. There
was no question of breaking it just by hand. Sita was sitting there
ready with the garment. Whoever breaks the bow.… And Laxmana was getting
very eager. They had gone with their teacher, Vashishtha. The father of
Rama had sent Vashishtha to take care of the boys and see that they were
not defeated, that no cunningness was being used. Laxmana was getting so
excited that he was asking again and again, "Vashishtha, just give me
permission and I will break it." Vashishtha said, "You just keep quiet.
Rama has the first right, he is your elder brother. If he fails, then
you have a chance."</p><p>Of course Rama broke the bow. Laxmana had seen Sita, seen the beauty
of the woman. She must have been a rare woman. Now he had to treat her
as if she were his mother. You can imagine his mind.</p><p>I explained to those people that Vinoba's explanation simply shows
Vinoba's mind. It has nothing to do with Laxmana. Vinoba was a celibate,
and he knew perfectly what celibacy means. Your dreams are full of
girls, your whole day is continuously a fantasy of sexuality. The
repressed sex tries in every possible way to break your unnatural idea
of celibacy. Vinoba was afraid of meeting women, seeing women. He used
to live isolated. He never lived in Gandhi's ashram itself, because
there were women there. He lived a few miles away. He used to come every
day at the prayer time, reading the story of Rama or some other
scripture, and would go back. But he lived in isolation. Around Gandhi's
ashram was dangerous: there were women, beautiful women, and he was a
celibate monk.</p><p>The explanation that he gave was his own mind, and the explanation is
a condemnation of Laxmana. It makes him a repressed sexual person. It is
a condemnation, it is not appreciation. Neither Vinoba understands the
psychology, nor Gandhi understands the psychology, because he confers
the degree of Acharya for this stupid explanation!</p><p>A case was filed against me, that somebody's religious feelings were
hurt. I said to the court, "This is strange. I have not said a single
word against Laxmana. I was criticizing Vinoba's explanation." Vinoba
was alive then. I told the court, "You call Vinoba, and I am ready to
argue with him that his explanation is wrong</p><p>-- not only wrong, but condemnatory.</p><p>"And from where does this man get the idea that his Hindu feelings
are hurt? Vinoba is not yet a Hindu incarnation of God, and I am trying
to save Laxmana, that this is not the right explanation. In any Sigmund
Freud's hands this explanation will mean Laxmana is sexually so much
repressed, so much afraid of his own repression that he cannot look at
the face of the woman."</p><p>The court finally agreed with me, but the court was also Hindu, so
they were not daring enough to call Vinoba also into the court. I said,
"This is unfair. I criticized him, this man says I have hurt his
feelings. Now the court gives the judgment that I am not speaking
against Hinduism, I have spoken against the explanation. Now it is the
duty of the court to call Vinoba. Vinoba has hurt the Hindu mind and the
Hindu mind's religious feeling."</p><p>But Vinoba was a great Hindu leader, so naturally he was never
called. The case was really against him, not against me. But one strange
thing happened. Whenever the case was in the court, thousands of people
would be there, inside the court, outside on the verandas, on the lawn
-- thousands of people, at least ten thousand people would come to
listen to what I was saying. And they were all Hindus. And when I won
the case, the man who had filed the case against me told the magistrate
that he needed police protection. I said, "For what? I need police
protection because I have hurt the feelings of the Hindu religion,
religious people, and these ten thousand people are Hindus. And I have
to go out of this room -- these ten thousand people can kill me. And
this fellow is asking police support and police protection -- for what?
Are these Hindus against him?"</p><p>They were. They could see the point clearly, they could see that this
man is simply a Hindu chauvinist. They could see that I had been
unnecessarily harassed for the whole year. And they were really angry,
they were shouting and screaming and asking that the man should be
delivered to them, so they could teach him what it means to be
"religiously hurt."</p><p>The magistrate himself was afraid that the situation was dangerous.
He told the man to go inside, behind, which was the magistrate's private
room, and just remain there until everybody was gone. "No police
protection will help, because these ten thousand people. From where can
I bring the whole army to prevent</p><p>these ten thousand people? The court has a few policemen, but they
are not enough to protect you. You just sit." And he went inside the
room and waited. I left, so naturally other people left by and by.
Perhaps he must have left just when the court was being closed, or he
must have left with the magistrate in his own car.</p><p>Exactly that type of case they have put in Germany. And soon they
will be putting it in every country. Because I told the Australian
media, "Get ready, I am</p><p>coming," now the whole of Australia is agog, afraid. Newspapers have
started coming, saying that people are very much disturbed, afraid that
I may remain there, may not leave Australia. But the man himself who was
here was an intelligent man. I really loved the man, he was not just a
journalist.</p><p>He is answering the phone calls continuously coming to his studio. He
informed us, "I have never answered myself, my secretary answers, but
this time I am answering myself because I can say to them that I have
been there, I have seen the man, I have seen the commune that is there,
and they are beautiful people, and you need not be afraid. And don't get
unnecessarily excited by rumors. There is no danger." But it is now all
over Australia, a great wave of fear. I have not gone there and there is
not much possibility.</p><p>But my people are there, and my people are growing in every country.
And in every country my people will have to face the same problems. They
cannot believe, the politicians and others, that I am not going to use
my influence politically. It is something inconceivable to those
retarded people, that there can be a man who has great influence and is
not going to use it in any way.</p><p>My influence is that of love. I love my people, and I would not like
to put my people in any kind of destructive situation.</p><p>But what can you do with people who are so afraid that they cannot
even come to visit the commune to see and experience themselves that
there is nothing to fear? My people are peaceful and wherever they will
go they will bring the peace, the silence, the rejoicing. They will
bring songs to every country and ecstasy to every land.</p><p>Our war is totally different. They don't understand. We are spreading
a certain kind of atmosphere around the world which can prevent wars,
which can prevent Adolf Hitlers, which can prevent nuclear weapons being
used.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, IN YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD BEING ONE COMMUNE, IS IT
STILL SO THAT THE ITALIANS SHOULD BE THE COOKS, THE FRENCH THE LOVERS
AND THE GERMANS THE ORGANIZERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Most probably, because who can cook better than the Italians? And
in my commune everybody is to do the best he can. Yes, the Germans will
be the organizers. They have proved -- and I have a greater number of
Germans than from any other country -- they are the best organizers, the
most reliable people. You can trust them, they can never betray. They
certainly have a very strong spirit.</p><p>But nobody is going to force them. If they want to change places they
can change, and that is how it is happening in my communes all over the
world. People don't remain stuck to one job, they want to learn many
more things. The doctor wants to learn plumbing, the plumber wants to be
a mechanic, the mechanic wants to be a cook. The commune is also a
university. It is so many things together. It is a religion, it is a
university, it is the birth place for the new man.</p><p>So my feeling is that Italians will try to learn how to organize,
although in the beginning their organization will be greasy, lousy,
spaghetti all over. Nobody is going to condemn them, that's natural. The
Germans cooking, you can understand, Koran Grove will be full. If we can
survive German cooking, that means a miracle has happened, but we will
try. We are open to all possibilities.</p><p>And it is already happening that way. In fact the moment you enter a
commune nobody recognizes you as Italian, as German, as Indian, as
American. All those things simply disappear; you are just my people --
the red people. A new identity comes up and throws out all old
identifications.</p><p>I don't know who is a German, who is an Italian, who is Greek, who is
Spanish. I don't know myself, except for a few people who had come to me
in the very beginning, so I know them more personally. That's why when I
want to say something about Germans I will use Haridas, because except
Haridas I don't know any German. If I have to talk about the English, I
have to talk about Teertha because I don't know anybody else. If I have
to talk about Italians, then Asheesh is the only Italian.</p><p>But there are many and now there is no possibility for me to be
acquainted the way I am with Teertha or Haridas or Asheesh. That way is
not possible any more. I will love you but I will not know your name. I
will do everything for you but I will not know your name, your race,
your country. And the thing has become so enormous and big, and it is
expanding with such speed, you cannot expect me to. In the beginning,
when there were only a few people who could be counted on fingers,
naturally I knew their name, their country, their background and they
had the chance of being more intimate. In the beginning it was possible.
But don't feel that those who have come late are deprived of anything,
because my work has really begun now. After I started speaking again,
those three years that I remained silent were just to give a gap. All
that I had done before that was only a preparation; then a three years'
gap so that all those who want to escape can escape before my real work
starts.</p><p>So those who have come just now, they should not feel deprived. My
work has begun just now. Now I am talking directly to you. There is no
Krishna between me and you and no Jesus between me and you. I am cutting
their heads right and left and creating a direct passage. I am not
allowing even people whom I love -- Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu -- I am not
going to let anyone stand between me and you. I am going to chop their
heads. Of course, lovingly. I can ask them, "Forgive me, but I have to
chop your head because now nobody stands between me and my people."</p><p>However beautiful is Heraclitus, and however much I have loved
Pythagoras and Zarathustra, it does not matter. That is my personal
affair. As far as you are concerned I am not going to let anybody else
stand between me and you. So nobody needs to feel that he has missed
something -- no!</p><p>My work has begun just now and you have all come in the right moment.
Those who have remained in the preparatory period, in the silent period,
of course, are</p><p>more fortunate. But if you have courage enough you can take a long
jump and be in the front line with the old sannyasins. It only needs
courage. They had enough time to go slowly, step by step. The new
sannyasins will have to jump four steps at a time. Soon you will be all
in the same line. And that's my effort, that's why I am giving you so
many shocks. Shocks are particularly good to keep people jumping. I
don't let them stand in one place. Another electric shock and they jump
four, five steps immediately. A day or two I may let them rest there,
but not more than that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHY IS THE MEDIA SO NERVOUS AROUND YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because they have never come across a man like I am. The media
knows politicians, popes, other kinds of leaders. They are all afraid of
the media and nervous. The politician is nervous, he has reasons to be
nervous. And the journalist is assertive and aggressive, and the
politician is simply dodging and trying to save his skull.</p><p>A few days ago I saw an interview with Rajiv Gandhi, who has become
now the prime minister of India. He was here in America. The interviewer
goes on continuously hammering and Rajiv Gandhi looks almost frozen, as
if any moment his breathing is going to stop. And I can see the reason,
because the interviewer tried in different ways to get Rajiv Gandhi to
say something against Russia. That Rajiv Gandhi cannot do. Before coming
to America, first he had gone to Russia. In fact, he must have been
prepared there in Russia, what to say and what not to say, because India
is almost in the hands of Russia. It is not a communist country but on
the very verge. Any day it is going to become a communist country.</p><p>The interviewer was also trying to force Rajiv to say something
against America. That he cannot do. In America, he has come to create
more friendship, he has come to get more uranium for nuclear weapons in
India, he cannot say anything against America. He cannot praise America,
either, because Soviet Russia will get upset. He cannot praise Soviet
Russia because America will get upset. So, naturally, the politician is
nervous before the media.</p><p>I have no problem. I can say exactly what I want to say. All the
media become nervous because they know they will not be able even to
report the things I say, because if they take all these things to the
editor, perhaps they may be thrown out of the job. They are nervous
because what I am saying is also hurting their prejudices. They are
human beings. First they are human beings, then they may be journalists;
first Christians, then they may be journalists. And when I am hitting on
Jesus they want to scream, but they cannot do that. Naturally, it
becomes a nervous feeling. They forget to ask what they wanted to ask.
They have never met a man like me who has nothing to lose, who can say
anything, who does not belong to your society, who does not care about
respectability.</p><p>Now the pope is continuously concerned that his respectability as the
greatest religious leader in the world should not be affected by any
statement. All his statements are prepared by other bishops, looked at
by a committee, everything is edited. He is simply a spokesman, he is
not speaking himself The whole church, the Catholic hierarchy is
decisive. He has just to speak what they teach him, what they tell him
to say.</p><p>Another fundamental reason they get nervous is that I am an
absolutely free man. I don't care about contradicting myself, so they
cannot put me into a corner by saying, "You said this fifteen years ago,
now you are saying that." They cannot put me into any corner. I say
forget it, to hell with those fifteen years. Whatever I am saying now is
true now. Tomorrow I do not promise I will say the same thing, because I
don't bother about consistency, about respectability, about what people
will think. I have no reason to be nervous, I simply enjoy their
nervousness.</p><p>It is strange, something new. The table with the water is placed by
the side of the person who is being interviewed. When he feels nervous
he can start drinking just to do something: get busy, forget
nervousness, and meanwhile he has time also to think what to say next.
Here it is just the opposite. The water and everything is placed by the
side of the media. And I see them plucking grapes, taking water, tossing
and turning in their chair, sometimes looking at the photographer,
sometimes at the director. They will never forget the interview, because
that kind of interview is never going to happen to them unless they come
here again, to have another nervous breakdown.</p><p>But my work is first to give you a nervous breakdown, because only
from there is there a possibility of a spiritual breakthrough. Breakdown
to breakthrough, that's the whole story.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-11>The Last Testament, Vol 1

INTERVIEW YOU. WE HAVE VERY INTELLIGENT READERS, THOUGH. I BROUGHT YOU A
SMALL PRESENT, A COPY OF THE PAPER, SO YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT DAVIS.
MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE IN MY TOWN HAVE HEARD OF YOU AND RAJNEESHPURAM HAS
BEEN ON TELEVISION AND IN THE NEWSPAPERS. NONE OF THEM HAS BEEN HERE
THAT I KNOW OF AND I KNOW THE TWO DAYS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE HAVE BEEN
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED. IN FACT, WHEN I CALLED MY EDITOR TO SAY
I HAD AN INTERVIEW, SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE BECAUSE
SHE WAS AFRAID YOU GUYS WOULDN'T LET ME COME BACK!</p><p>SO, ANYWAY, DAVIS IS A VERY ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS KIND OF TOWN, AND
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE NEED A STRUCTURE OR FRAMEWORK TO?UNDERSTAND YOU.
YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT A PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION.… CAN YOU STATE IN ORDINARY
AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS TERMS WHAT YOU STAND FOR?</p><p>ANSWER: It is very difficult for me, almost impossible, because I
never adjust to speak with you or anybody. I speak, you have to adjust
with me to listen. It does not matter whether your readers are middle
class, higher class, or lower class. I will say the same thing. If they
are middle, they will have to raise their heads up a little to
understand, for the simple reason that whatever I am saying, I have
brought to its simplest form. To make it more simple is just not
possible.</p><p>I am not a philosopher. The philosopher thinks about the truth. His
approach is rational. Reason is his instrument, and here just the
opposite is the case. I am an irrational man. And the people who have
gathered around me -- around the world -- the appeal to them is my
irrationality, because reason has failed so utterly. For three thousand
years in the West, ten thousand years in the East,</p><p>philosophers have been struggling to find the truth, and not a single
philosopher has been able to find it.</p><p>The way of philosophy does not go with truth at all. It is just
rational gymnastics. So one philosopher can argue against another
philosopher, and they go on arguing for centuries, but they have not
come to agreement on a single point. Philosophy is the worst wastage of
human intelligence that is possible. When I say I am not a philosopher,
I simply mean that my approach towards reality is not through the head,
it is through the heart.</p><p>I also say that I do not preach a religion because religion is
something like love -- you cannot teach it. There is no way to teach
love, and if you teach love and somebody becomes trained under your
teachings, he may go to Hollywood and become an actor, but he will never
become a lover. Your very teaching, your very discipline will be the
barrier. So I say I don't teach religion. Religion is something that
passes heart to heart, not head to head. The moment religion passes head
to head, it becomes theology. It is no more religion.</p><p>I compare it with love because that is the only human experience that
comes a little close to the experience of truth. The only difference is
that in love, you need somebody else... at least two is a basic
necessity. Whom are you going to love? Who is going to respond to you?
So love is a dialogue; religion is a monologue. You don't have anybody
there -- God, some messiah, some prophet. There is no one with whom you
can have a dialogue. You, in utter silence, feel it. It is simply a
state of mind at rest -- and the heart throbbing in a deep harmony with
existence.</p><p>So I cannot call it a religion the way Christianity is, the way other
religions are. They can manage to give you a catechism which the middle
class people will understand. For example, middle class people can even
understand the atheist who says God does not exist. They may not agree
with him, but they can understand what he is saying. They can understand
the priest who says God exists. They understand, the statements are
simple. My position is a little more delicate.</p><p>I say there is no God, but there is godliness. So I destroy God as a
person. He becomes more like a fragrance than a flower. I am not a
theist because I don't believe in God as a person creating the world. I
am not an atheist because I am taking God higher than he has ever been.
From a quantity I am transforming him into a quality. But I am not a
theist and I am not an atheist. And for people to understand godliness
is certainly a little difficult. It is as difficult as if you tell me
that you come from a town where everybody is blind, and ask me to say
something about light so those people can understand.</p><p>What can I say about light to people who are blind, who have never
experienced light? There have been preachers around for centuries
telling blind people what light looks like, what light is. And there are
three hundred religions and three hundred different definitions of
light. They all cannot be true, but they all can be false. In the first
place to try to make an endeavor explaining light to the blind is</p><p>stupid. What the blind man needs is not a priest, but a physician,
not a teacher, but a surgeon who can give him eyes. It is not a question
of giving him the definition of light. The question is to give him eyes.
If he can see, he will never ask what light is -- he will know. But the
priests have been preventing people because they go on supplying
definitions of light to the blind.</p><p>And of course, nobody wants to be ignorant. That's why people
believe. It is not coming from their hearts, because it is not their
experience. Anything that is your experience is bound to have its roots
in your heart. But people cling to beliefs about things which they don't
know. They cling for a simple reason: they cannot accept that they are
ignorant. And the first step to understand is to accept the fact that,
"I do not know."</p><p>Those middle class people about whom you are asking, they are all
knowers. You may think they are middle class, but they all know God
exists. What kind of God... Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan.… They
know the holy book. They know the holy Koran, the holy Gita. And
everything is known to them, that's what they think. They know nothing
-- knowing should be your experience, and they confuse knowledgeability
with knowing. And my effort is to prepare the ground for knowing, not
for faith, belief. So only the very intelligent people can come to
me.</p><p>But remember one thing: the greatest intelligent people have come
from the middle class. The poor man is so hungry and starving, he has no
energy for thinking and inquiring about truth. He is searching for bread
and butter. His basic physiological needs are not fulfilled, so no
genius has ever come from the poor. It is impossible.</p><p>From the rich it is also impossible, for a totally different reason.
The rich man has everything that he needs. He misses all the challenges
of life. He is too much protected, and if you protect a child too much
you will cripple him. What does he need intelligence for?</p><p>When I was a student in the university, I met a student who had been
in the same master's degree class for ten years continuously! I could
not believe it. I asked him and he said, "Who cares about passing? I
enjoy being among the students. I have money, I have time, I have a car.
I can get the most beautiful girl any time. I don't come here to learn
geography and history and psychology. I am not concerned, I am not
interested. What can they give me? If I pass and I have a degree, that
cannot make me richer. I am already too rich."</p><p>Geniuses have never come from the super-rich people, they are born in
the middle class. The middle class has been the source of all great
scientists, mystics, philosophers, so don't take middle class in a
derogatory way.</p><p>And what is the reason why the middle class brings intelligence to
its climax? The reason is simple: the middle class is continuously
struggling to reach higher. There is a possibility for the middle class
to enter into the richer class. It is just there, a little more effort
and he will cross the boundary of being a middle class person. There are
only a few rungs on the ladder. It is not impossible for a</p><p>middle class man to conceive himself becoming super-rich. This is one
side, he goes on sharpening his intelligence. On the other side, he is
always afraid of falling down among the poor. So he is fighting a double
fight. First, not to fall into the poor class, not to become a
proletarian; second, he is fighting, competing, because he can see the
goal is not far away. Just a few steps more and he has arrived. This
gives him a double chance of sharpening his intelligence. That's why all
the geniuses have come from the middle class.</p><p>So don't be worried about the middle class in your city. They are
fortunate to be in the middle class. To be poor is ugly; to be
super-rich makes your life closer to vegetation. The rich man is almost
a cabbage, perhaps a cauliflower. The difference is not much: the
cauliflower is only a cabbage with a college degree.</p><p>I am absolutely certain they will understand what I have to say, but
I will not adjust, because I don't compromise on anything. I say the way
I feel to say. Whether anyone understands or not, it is their business.
I will not come down and compromise and say things which are appealing
to them, which they can understand. What can they understand? Only that
which they already know, for which they have been conditioned. They can
understand absurd, idiotic things.</p><p>Just now, I saw a newspaper cutting that the prophet Mohammed teaches
Mohammedans that the woman has only one chance of reaching paradise, no
other qualification is needed from her. Only one chance, one simple
chance, and that is to make her husband entirely satisfied as far as sex
is concerned. Great! This is the qualification to enter into paradise,
just to satisfy the husband sexually. Mohammed says that the woman
cannot say no any time the husband wants to make love to her, because
her no is a sin. And, you may believe or you may not believe, he says
that even if the husband and wife are riding a camel and the husband
wants to make love on the camel's back, the wife should not say no. And
these people have been teachers, masters, prophets, God's messengers.
Great messages God is sending: make love on the back of a camel. Just to
sit on the back of a camel is so difficult! Lovemaking itself is such
gymnastics, and to do those gymnastics on the camel's back. It will be
really a scene! And these are</p><p>the messages that are being sent, and these are the messengers. He is
simply a male chauvinist, just trying to make women into complete
slaves. But Mohammedans have never questioned it. Mohammed himself
married nine women. Nobody told him that the quantity of men and women
on the earth is equal, almost equal, that to marry nine women means you
are depriving eight men of having wives. And these eight men are not
just going to be sitting and waiting. They will do something. They will
become homosexuals.</p><p>You may not know that in Mohammedan countries homosexuality is
thought the biggest crime. And for homosexuality, the only punishment is
the death sentence. Now, I cannot see the logic. On the one hand,
Mohammed allows every Mohammedan at least four wives. Of course, he is a
prophet, so he has nine, but his followers, because they are his
followers, are entitled to have only four wives.</p><p>This is so unscientific, unbiological, that the remaining men are
bound to become homosexuals, perverts.</p><p>But nobody, not a single Mohammedan in the fourteen centuries since
Mohammed, has even bothered. Christians can understand perfectly well
any absurdity that is Christian. They can accept that Jesus was born out
of a virgin mother. They know perfectly well it is not the way of
nature. The whole story that the holy ghost makes her pregnant is a
cover-up. Who is this fellow, the holy ghost? And why did he stop making
other virgins pregnant? He has done a great job, giving Jesus to the
world. He should be continuously making virgins pregnant. The more
Jesuses, the better. But he did it only once -- never before, never
after -- just a single act and the holy ghost has disappeared. Nobody
bothers to ask. If he is a Christian, he will accept the virgin birth.
He will accept the resurrection of Jesus after death.</p><p>People understand easily what they have been conditioned for. And my
work is unconditioning people, deprogramming people. There are other
deprogrammers, but they are not really deprogrammers, they are
reprogrammers. If some Christian starts becoming a Hindu, they will
deprogram the person and reprogram him back into Christianity. I simply
deprogram, and then leave you alone. I have no program to give you. I
want you to be totally alone, fresh, without any borrowed knowledge.
Because only then there is a possibility of experiencing the beauty of
this existence, the ecstasy of being alive, the meaning, the truth.</p><p>If anybody really wants to understand, he should come here. For a
seeker, an inquirer, Rajneeshpuram is not far away. People are coming
here from all over the world. If a person is here for a certain period
of time, experiencing the people who are here, the way they relate, the
climate of love, the serenity of the place, the silent communication
between me and my people -- if they can come and dance, sing, and be
part of us -- then perhaps they will get something, a taste that you
cannot describe. Nobody has been able to describe what sweetness is. The
only way is to drink a Coca-Cola.</p><p>I am a drunkard. I am drunk twenty-four hours. The source of my drugs
is inside me, so no government can catch me. There is no way to find out
from where I am getting my champagne. And my people slowly, slowly start
getting drunk. So it is a question of taste. If you can simply provoke
those people that there is something worth tasting, that they should not
miss it, then it will be possible for them to understand whatever I am
saying. I use simple language, I have no jargon. I am not an expert
about anything. To understand me is very easy.</p><p>The problem arises that you cannot understand me just through words.
And it is not a new problem, it has always been so. The person who
experiences something in his innermost core finds it difficult to
translate it into language, because language is created for mundane
affairs. What can lovers say to each other? At the most, "I love you."
And if, unfortunately, the woman has a philosophical mind and asks,
"What is love, what is it that you are proposing?"</p><p>explain that first you have to understand what love is, only then can
you understand whether to take it or not.</p><p>Fortunately women are not philosophers. They don't ask what love is.
In fact, they know more of love than men. It is men who have created all
kinds of violence on the earth, and are preparing to destroy the whole
life on earth. It is absolutely men's responsibility. Women have not
been participants in it. But if a woman has a philosophical mind, then
no lover can explain. Then the only way is, rather than saying, "I love
you," he starts making gestures of love, holding her hand, dancing with
her, looking into her eyes, singing with her, listening to the music, or
just sitting silently together looking at the night, the stars. Perhaps
just being together something will transpire.</p><p>And that is love. It is a transfer of some invisible energy, and
exactly the same thing is religion. One who has known his own being is
capable of sharing his being with you, and in that sharing, something
will be triggered in you. And the moment you know the truth, it will not
be the truth of the Master, it will be your own. He has never given you
truth. He has never talked about it. He has not said a single word about
it, because nothing can be said about truth.</p><p>All words are futile as far as truth is concerned. No word has the
potentiality to express values like truth, joy, blissfulness, ecstasy.
There is no way. But one thing you can do. You can give them a
challenge: if there is something worth experiencing, at least don't
condemn it before you have experienced it. And I know that anybody who
comes here open and ready to learn puts his conditioning aside and
forgets that he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan.</p><p>It is a very simple and natural phenomenon. It starts happening to
you. It is happening, and that's the purpose of creating communes around
the world. So that anywhere there is a group of a thousand or two
thousand people vibrating with their meditative energy, dancing to
abandon, singing madly, ecstatic for nothing, a man is going to get
drunk just being in an open contact with the commune. There have been
teachers, great masters, but what they were doing was theology, not
religion. Religion needs a human lab, and that's what the commune is;
because religion is the highest human engineering.</p><p>It is said -- and perhaps it is true. In India, music is a very
ancient tradition, and</p><p>Indian music has qualities of its own, its beauty, its silence. It is
not sexual the way jazz is sexual or the Beatles are sexual. It is
something totally different. Listening to the classical music you will
feel something coming from a different world. In the history of Indian
music it is said, and perhaps it is true, that if in a silent room a
master sitar player plays the sitar and you keep a few other sitars in
the room, soon those other sitars start vibrating. Nobody is playing on
them, but they start getting in tune with the master player. And I see
every possibility that it is not just a story, because vibrations can
hit those sitars; just a master player, a maestro is needed.</p><p>In Indian music there are ragas. A raga is a certain type of music
for a certain period of time. For example, for the morning, one raga;
for the evening, another; for the middle of the night, another. Around
the clock those ragas are played, but each has its own time. And it is
really strange, that if you play the raga that is meant to be played in
the early morning, in the evening, it does not create the same climax
within you. The same man is playing, but something is missing.</p><p>It is just like at sunrise when the birds start singing and the
flowers open up. At sunset the birds stop singing, the flowers start
closing. Existence is going into rest, so there is a different music for
this moment which will be in tune with the whole existence. There is a
different tune for the morning Because the sun is rising, your music
should be harmonious with the rising energy, the wakening energy of
existence.</p><p>I am not a musician, but I have meditated around the clock, and I was
surprised that a certain method functions at a certain period, perhaps
in the morning. Another method opens the doors in the evening, and you
cannot use the same method for the morning.</p><p>In a commune where five thousand meditators are living, working,
being, you will get drunk. It is bound to happen. So the people were
really right when they told you, "Don't go there, we are afraid you may
not come back again." It has happened to many, and I can see the
possibility that it can happen to you. Because who would like to leave
this beautiful commune for that ugly world that exists outside with all
the politicians, with all the rapes and murders, and everybody trying to
cut everybody else's throat? Who wants to live there? Here there is no
competition, no struggle, no crime. People don't have time. Either they
are meditating or they are working or they are loving. There is no time
to do anything stupid.</p><p>I have no philosophy, I have no religion; yet, I inspire people for a
different kind of life which is religiousness, divineness, godliness.
But my emphasis is that all nouns are wrong, only verbs are right. When
you say, "Look at this tree," when you say, "This is a tree," you are
not stating exactly that the tree is not a noun, and cannot be a noun,
because it is growing. It is treeing. In existence there are no nouns at
all. The river is rivering, the tree is treeing. Each moment you are
somebody else. Each moment you are growing.</p><p>The growth never stops, and if you are consciously helping the
growth, then you will not only grow old, you will also grow up into
wisdom -- which brings peace to the heart and which brings the light
which reveals to you the immortality of your being. And at the same time
it reveals the immortality of everything in existence. Things go on
changing their form, but nobody dies.</p><p>Death is illusory, it has never happened; only consciousness is
transmigrating into other bodies. And I don't want people to believe me,
I don't teach transmigration of the soul. I simply help them to come to
that space where they will be able to know it on their own. If a person
can see his past lives, which is</p><p>very simple, if he can see his thousands of past lives stretching to
eternity, the logical conclusion is that he is going to continue in the
future also to eternity. Eternity to eternity.</p><p>With that experience, all fear disappears, because all fear is
somehow rooted in death which is coming closer every day. We try to
deceive ourselves and others in every possible way. We make our
graveyards outside the city so that we are not reminded of death again
and again. Whenever you pass by the graveyard, the thought is bound to
come that sooner or later you will also be lying down in some grave.
Perhaps the next grave that is being dug is for you. Nobody knows. It is
certainly for someone, and that someone can be you. We have tried to
deceive ourselves with the belief that the soul will not die. But that
is a belief, and belief is just useless. It won't help you to any
transformation. You are believing it because it is helpful. You can keep
your eyes closed to death, although you know that this is only a belief,
that life is eternal.</p><p>So I don't teach any belief I teach methods of how to enter into
different spaces which are available inside you. So those who are
interested, bring them. Perhaps what they have not found in their whole
life they may find here in this small oasis in the desert of Oregon. And
don't think at all that those middle class people will not understand
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I APPRECIATE THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR ANSWER. I DON'T REMEMBER MY
QUESTION, BUT I'M SURE YOU ANSWERED IT.</p><p>A: That's good.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SINCE AMERICANS, AND ESPECIALLY OREGONIANS, PRIDE THEMSELVES AS
HAVING THE LAND OF THE FREE -- WE HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME AT GRADE
SCHOOLS, NATIONAL ANTHEMS AND SO ON -- WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE
ARE SO OPPOSED -- I MEAN NOT JUST OPPOSED, BUT REALLY ARDENTLY OPPOSED
-- TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I'm not surprised by it. If I was not opposed then certainly I
would have been surprised.</p><p>It is just a natural phenomenon. If you have been miserable your
whole life, if you have lived in a society where everybody is miserable
-- they all have their styles of being miserable, different colors,
different shades, but basically everybody is miserable -- then you don't
see people just laughing for no reason, or just dancing because the moon
is full tonight. Your society condemns such people as crazy. So when
they have to encounter a commune like this, their first reaction is that
if such blissfulness has not happened to them, these people and their
existence prove to them that they have missed the train.</p><p>It will be good that these people are removed, destroyed, because
they become a question mark. It hurts that there are people who are
happy: Why am i not happy? If others have been able to manage it, then
what is wrong with me that I cannot manage it?</p><p>A great inferiority complex arises. And whenever you are under the
impact of feeling inferior, there are only two ways to think: either
think that these people are mad, perhaps hypnotized, or that something
is wrong with them. But this explanation cannot stand long, because
these people are doing everything so intelligently, they cannot be mad.
They are so conscious and alert, they cannot be just moving like robots,
hypnotized. They are not sleepwalkers. So condemn them, that they are
immoral, that they are against God, that they are not religious.</p><p>Just condemn them so you can feel a certain guarantee that you have
not missed life. Whatever life has, you have: television, a car, a good
job, a wife, children. This is what life gives, so you have got it. But
these people have got something else, and that hurts. Condemn them. Find
out bogus, false charges against them. I invite these people just to
come close and see, but they are afraid to come close, because deep down
they know they will be infected by these people, and they will be left
in a limbo.</p><p>All their investments are there in the world. Here, they will be
coming into a strange space where they have no idea even what is
happening, where these people are going. And there is the conflict in
the mind of leaving the old world, where you had all your acquaintances
and friends and family. They also were all miserable, so there was a
certain affinity, a family feeling, a certain equality; there you cannot
risk. Those who come here only come if they have the guts to risk.</p><p>You mentioned that they can tolerate Olympics, they can tolerate
boxing, they can tolerate every other thing, and asked, "Why are they
against you?" The reason is clear. The boxing does not make them feel
inferior. In fact, the boxing helps them to release their violence.
California University has been studying why, after a boxing match,
violence increases immediately fourteen percent. They have studied only
violence. They should also study other things after boxing -- how many
more rapes happen, how many more murders happen, how many more suicides
happen -- and you will find they are all increased.</p><p>The society is so violent, so full of violence that just a football
match, and people are ready to kill each other. A boxing match is simply
ugly, barbarous. People enjoying two persons hitting each other like
animals, breaking their noses, hurting their eyes, bringing blood... and
people are clapping and shouting and enjoying. They get in some way
identified with one of the fighters. Everybody in the stadium is
identified with one wrestler, boxer. His victory is their victory. When
he hits the enemy they are hitting the enemy. It is unconscious, but it
is a release.</p><p>Those who have too much violence, when just the identification won't
help, they raise the percentage of actual violence after the match is
over. For four days the percentage remains higher and then slowly it
goes down. The same is true about football matches, about Olympics. They
fit perfectly in their violent society. Even war fits perfectly. Nuclear
weapons fit perfectly.</p><p>I am nonviolent and I stand for love, not for war. And I don't see
that there is any need... things like boxing should be absolutely
prohibited. They are ugly and barbarous. People can go there, thousands
go, and millions of people are sitting glued to their chairs before the
TV. It is strange that violence is so much appreciated, enjoyed. These
people must be all carrying some violence in them, otherwise I don't see
it, I cannot enjoy boxing. It is disgusting.</p><p>The phenomenon of the commune is just the opposite, and that's why it
is so troublesome to them. If we were also boxers here, eating meat,
doing all kinds of crime, they would have been perfectly happy to accept
us. We are strangers to them. It hurts their egos. We are creating
civilization. Up to now it has been only a word.</p><p>The Romans thought they had come to the peak of their civilization,
and at the peak, what were they enjoying? Throwing Christians to hungry
lions. I think they must have been very compassionate people. They could
see lions hungry, and they provided the best food they could find. Why
were they against Christians? The same reason: in the beginning
Christianity was a stranger.</p><p>Now nobody is against Christians because Christians have compromised
with the society. They are only nominally Christians. Sunday morning
religion is their whole religion, and their church is nothing but a club
where they go to gossip. And nobody listens to the priest. There is
nothing to listen to. That man has been repeating the same sermon again
and again, but he can repeat the same sermon because nobody is
listening.</p><p>I have heard that a Christian minister was very much disturbed by one
old man who was the richest man of his congregation. Of course, he used
to sit just in front of the priest, but he was old and he had heard
these sermons so many times that they were like sleeping pills for him.
The moment the priest would start he would fall asleep. That was not a
problem; the problem was he snored. But he was the richest man, the
richest donor. In everything, he was helpful to the church. In fact, he
was the only man who was keeping the minister paid, otherwise the
congregation would disappear. So the minister could not say anything to
the man; but complaints started coming to him from other people.</p><p>They were saying, "We are not against his sleeping, he can go to
sleep for good. What troubles us is that he disturbs our sleep by
snoring. And just a beautiful Sunday morning and one feels so good to
have a little nap. But this old man. "</p><p>The old man used to come with his great-grandson. The boy enjoyed
sitting there by the side of the old man. The priest took him away from
the old man and told him, "I will give you one dollar every Sunday if
you keep hitting the old man with your elbow so that he does not fall
asleep. That is your work." The boy said,</p><p>"Done! There is no problem. I will not let him sleep a single moment,
but I don't believe in priests and I don't trust them. Pay me in
advance."</p><p>The priest gave him one dollar, and the next Sunday morning the boy
continued pushing the old man with his elbow. The old man was very
angry, and looked at the boy again and again, but he could not say
anything. The priest was there, the whole congregation was there, but he
did not allow him to sleep.</p><p>Outside, the old man was enraged. He said, "You stupid. What happened
to you? Why did you go on hitting me with your elbow and waking me up?
I'm old, in the nights I don't have any sleep. This is the only place
where at least for one hour, one and a half hours, I can have a good
time. Doctors have failed. In fact, doctors have suggested, 'Why don't
you start going to Sunday sermon? When we fail to give sleep to any
patient we send him to the church, and it always succeeds without
exception.'</p><p>"So, you rascal," he said to the boy, "you disturbed my whole joy;
now I will have to wait one week again. But what went wrong, why were
you doing this? You were always sitting silently." The boy said, "It is
something concerning business." The old man said, "What business? What
business have you started doing?" He showed him the dollar. "The priest
is paying me one dollar to keep you awake." The old man said, "Then you
should have told me before. I will give you two dollars every week.
Don't disturb me." The boy said, "So far, so good. The business is going
good. Two dollars, in advance."</p><p>He got the advance, and the next Sunday morning he was sitting
silently. The priest made many hints, but the child would not look at
him at all. He would look here, there, everywhere else. The priest said,
"What has happened to this boy? Last Sunday was so peaceful." After the
service, the priest caught hold of the boy and said, "You are cheating
me. I am giving you one dollar per sermon. Why have you stopped hitting
the old man?" The boy said, "He is giving me two dollars for not hitting
him. Now if you want, the price has gone up. If you give me three
dollars I will keep him awake."</p><p>The priest said, "I cannot compete with your old man. He is so rich
he can give you any amount of money. I am a poor priest. Three dollars
per sermon, I will go bankrupt."</p><p>These people who go to the churches are no disturbance to the
society. It is their society. Jesus was a disturbance, hence they
crucified him. After Jesus, his apostles started compromising with the
society, and what a coincidence. He was crucified by the order of the
emperor of Rome, and later on Rome became the capital of world
Christianity.</p><p>Existence works in strange ways. These people who are against me,
hostile towards me and my people, one day you will find them in red
clothes. I just have to manage to be assassinated. Then everything will
be good, then I will gain their sympathy. Right now I am such a
disturbance. They have never conceived such a religious man, one who has
ninety Rolls Royces, hundreds of diamond watches, and a 126-square-mile
ranch, three times bigger than New York. Naturally they</p><p>should be offended. I am responsible for their being offended. And I
am trying to introduce a totally new religious phenomenon which goes
against their morality, their etiquette.</p><p>Everything that they have, my commune goes against it. Because I have
seen one thing clearly: every society is an organic whole. If there is
rape, murder, theft, and all kinds of crimes and perversions, then
whatever good is there is so interconnected with the bad that we stand
even against those things that appear good. We can see the
interconnection between the good and the bad. They are two sides of the
same coin, and we have renounced both. We are amoral people. We are not
immoral, we are not moral.</p><p>We are amoral people. This is their problem. They can deal with moral
people, they can deal with immoral people, but they don't know how to
deal with us. It is so new to them, they are puzzled and confused. But
this is really the shock of the beginning of a new man. These are the
birth pangs. The society is going, but we are going to continue to grow
-- not in spite of them, but because of them. If they are hostile and
they hate us, we are already connected. We have a certain relationship
already. Sometimes friendship is not so deep as enmity.</p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from a sannyasin: "I love you.
My wife likes you but does not love you. I love my wife. I want to move
to a commune, and now I am in great difficulty. My wife likes you but
she is not ready to move to the commune. She does not love you that
much. I love you so much I want to move, but what will happen to my wife
and children? I am in a dilemma." When I heard the letter I said, "This
man is going to be in great difficulty." If the wife hated me, things
would have been simple, but she likes me. Like never changes into love.
Hate has the capacity to change into love. In fact, it is love standing
on its head.</p><p>I am really happy that people are hostile. How long can they remain
hostile? And they are unnecessarily wasting their time and energy, and
having nightmares, and we don't care a bit. We are not bothered. We are
enjoying the time that is available to us. Tomorrow is uncertain, so we
are not going to sacrifice today for any tomorrow. We are existential
people. Just this moment is so much, who cares whether the next moment
we survive or not?</p><p>But they will have to change their attitude. You cannot carry
hostility long. It starts disturbing your stomach, raises your pulse
beat, and gives you heart attacks. We have not done any harm to anybody.
They are doing it on their own. They are creating it for their own
death. If they understand just a little psychology, before becoming
hostile, please come and become acquainted. I am not a missionary and I
don't convert anybody.</p><p>If a person wants to be converted, wants to become a sannyasin, that
is his responsibility. We are not making any effort to change any man,
because I think that is trespassing, and I respect the individual as one
of the highest values in the world.</p><p>Q: I'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY MORE QUESTIONS. MAYBE WE GO TO
A TRUE/FALSE FORMAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Next time. Next time, and till all your questions are finished, go
on coming. And when all questions are finished, then what are you going
to do? Be careful.</p><p>Q: THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-12>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 23.]</p><p>Lynn Hudson INDIA ABROAD NEW YORK</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: YES, BHAGWAN, I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT 'INDIA ABROAD.' IT'S AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE WEEKLY NEWSPAPER ABOUT
INDIANS AND ABOUT INDIA, MAINLY FOR INDIAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, OR
ASIAN INDIANS IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT IT IS CIRCULATED SOMEWHAT IN INDIA,
AS WELL. ANOTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT I HAVE COVERED THE
ACTIVITIES OF THIS COMMUNITY SINCE ITS INCEPTION. SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN
THIS COUNTRY FOR FOUR YEARS NOW, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR REACTIONS
ARE TO AMERICA, AMERICANS AND AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: America is not what it pretends to be. It is just a second
Soviet Union. But they are truthful; America is hypocritical. The
democracy is just in the name, it does not function.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU LIVE IN THE SOVIET UNION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am living in the Soviet Union. Oregon is a state in the Soviet
Union.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT, WHY ARE YOU HAPPY HERE? OR
ARE YOU HAPPY HERE?</p><p>A: I am happy anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EVEN IN A PLACE AS OPPRESSIVE AS THE UNITED STATES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, even in Oregon.</p><p>Q: HOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ONES
THAT YOU'VE MET, THAT YOU'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH? OR THE ONES THAT
YOU'VE READ ABOUT?</p><p>A: I know only the Americans who are with me, but they are no longer
Americans. I don't come in contact with other Americans, because I never
go anywhere.</p><p>Q: BUT MANY AMERICANS COME HERE TO SEE YOU, DO THEY NOT? THE PARENTS
OF YOUR SANNYASINS, AND OTHERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't meet them. Thousands of Americans are my sannyasins, but
the man who becomes a sannyasin drops all hangovers: American,
Christian, Hindu, Indian, Mohammedan, communist. He throws all that crap
away. That is the essential thing for a sannyasin to do, to be just a
human being without any labels. Man is not a commodity that you can
label. To label human beings is ugly. So there are people who were once
Americans who have become sannyasins. I can tell you about them; they
are in contact with me. They are some of the best and most beautiful
people in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I WONDER IF I MIGHT ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD IN INDIA? WHAT
WAS IT LIKE? HOW DID OTHER CHILDREN RELATE TO YOU? HOW DID YOU RELATE TO
THEM? HOW DID THEY FEEL ABOUT YOU? HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF AS A
CHILD?</p><p>A: I was a little strange as a child. I never played with any
children because deep down I never felt that I was their age. In my
childhood I was discussing with adults, old people, but my relationship
with my own age group was nil.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU FELT YOURSELF A TEACHER EVEN THEN, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. I have always felt that I have something to give, and as I
grew up, that thing became more and more clear. I had always related
with people who were at least twenty, thirty years older than me, only
with them could I argue and discuss things in which other children were
not interested.</p><p>Q: DID THIS MAKE YOU AN OUTCAST WITH CHILDREN YOUR OWN AGE? DID THAT
MATTER TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was an outcast, and I am still an outcast. Perhaps that's my
fate, my destiny -</p><p>- to be the outsider -- but I have enjoyed it my whole life. I don't
remember a single moment when I have felt badly about whatever I am. I
have rejoiced in my being and I have kept my freedom completely intact.
Nobody has been an</p><p>influence on me -- neither a teacher, nor a professor, nor a saint, a
religious leader, a political leader. In fact, as I grew up and my
arguments became sharper, teachers and professors were afraid of me. And
I was not just an outsider; I was expelled from many colleges for the
simple reason that the professors felt embarrassed. They were not able
to answer my questions, and they were not courageous enough to accept my
answers.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMIC THERE, THOUGH, IN
YOUR FEELING AN OUTCAST, THAT LED YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF FORMING A
COMMUNE OF WHICH YOU ARE THE CENTER?</p><p>A: I have not made the commune. I started on the way alone. People
started coming to me and it became a vast caravan which is now spread
all over the world. And people are still coming. I have not made it, it
has happened. It was not a planned thing, not something considered.</p><p>I don't have any discipline, any rules, any regulations. Somebody
coming and becoming a fellow traveler is welcome. If he leaves at some
crossroads, we say goodbye to him with the same joy, ecstasy, as we had
when he joined us. And we tell him, "Whenever you want, the doors will
always be open for you."</p><p>But I have not made the commune. Certainly, when five thousand people
are living here, so many arrangements have to be made; but all that
credit goes to the sannyasins. I have nothing to do with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE ADULATION THAT IS OBVIOUSLY FELT FOR YOU HERE IN THIS
COMMUNITY, DOES THAT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HUMILITY OR A SENSE OF
OMNIPOTENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I BEG YOUR PARDON?</p><p>A: Just ecstasy, it gives to me. It does not give me a bigger ego; it
does not give me the opposite, the humble ego. They are both egos.
Sometimes the humble man is more egoistic than the straightforward
egoist. As far as I am concerned, it is not adoration. They rejoice.
They love me. I am not higher than them; they are my friends, my lovers,
on an equal basis as far as I am concerned. Now it is up to them whether
to listen to me or not to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ASKING, I GUESS, IS WHAT DOES IT DO TO YOUR
HEAD, AS THEY SAY, TO FEEL ALL THIS LOVE? -- I MEAN, AS A HUMAN BEING TO
BE THE CENTER OF SO MUCH WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, LOVE, ADORATION,
ADULATION?</p><p>A: I rejoice. It is beautiful to have so many hearts beating in the
same tune as my heart is beating.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE AS HAPPY IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE
SANNYASINS AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LEADER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I cannot be more happy; I cannot be less happy. Happiness is
something that is within me, it is not dependent on anybody. If all the
sannyasins are gone, I will be happy with the trees, I will be happy
with the stars. And I can dance with the trees and the stars; it does
not matter -- I can dance in my bathroom. I am a happy person.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN REGARD TO THE REMARKS YOU MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE UNITED STATES,
I WOULD GATHER THAT YOU DO COMMENT ON POLITICS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU
WHAT YOUR FEELINGS ARE ABOUT RAJIV GANDHI AND THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF
INDIA.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Rajiv Gandhi is just an amateur politician, knowing nothing about
politics, and he is going to be destructive. He is going to impose the
same emergency that his mother did. All that he knows is his mother and
he simply will be repeating what she has done.</p><p>Q: SO YOU FORESEE ANOTHER EMERGENCY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Another emergency, another assassination. And this time it is
going to be worse than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS OF SIKHISM AND OF THE SIKH EXTREMIST
ELEMENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Sikhs are beautiful people. Perhaps the community of the Sikhs is
the only community in the whole of India you can rely upon for
something. They are simple, courageous people -- most trustworthy,
reliable, not cunning. They are unafraid of anything; otherwise, the
Indians are cowards.</p><p>Q: DO YOU FAVOR SEPARATE STATEHOOD FOR PUNJAB?</p><p><br></p><p>A: India has never been one nation and can never be. It is something
forcibly put together. In Gautam Buddha's time, India was divided into
two thousand independent nations. It was the Moguls who conquered India
and started making other states dissolve into the Mogul empire. They
created the background for the British raj. When the Britishers took
over, India for the first</p><p>time became one country -- but forcibly, under slavery, because there
was no other way.</p><p>Once India became independent, all the troubles started. Even before
independence, Mohammedans were asking for a separate country of their
own. And I think they were not wrong. In a country in which Hindus are a
majority, Mohammedans will have no chance. They will be suppressed and
Hindus will take the revenge of thousands of years. It was good that
Pakistan was taken apart from India. I am in favor of freedom at any
cost.</p><p>If Sikhs want to be free, if they want their own nation, they have
every right to have it. To prevent them is undemocratic, against
freedom, against the dignity of people. Who is Rajiv Gandhi to prevent
them? Who was Indira Gandhi to prevent them? I have been a friend to
Indira Gandhi, and she had immense respect for me. But when she was
assassinated, I didn't feel sorry. I simply felt it was her own doing.
It is a simple thing: if Sikhs want independence, give it to them. Why
enforce? -- and other provinces are also asking.</p><p>Assam is asking for independence. Their leaders have been crushed,
jailed, or they have escaped from the country, but the fight continues.
The same is going to happen sooner or later to the south Indian states,
because they don't belong to the north in any way. They are not Aryans
as the northern Indians are. They don't have any language derived from
Sanskrit as are all the languages of northern India. In color they are
different, in culture they are different. Why should they be forced?
Everybody should be given independence. Even if India disappears
completely, it is perfect. It is disappearing in favor of freedom and
democracy.</p><p>Q: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT MRS. GANDHI SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT YOU WERE ON
GOOD TERMS WITH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU LEFT INDIA.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was with Indira Gandhi not with the Indian government.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DID THAT WORK? WHAT WERE THE DYNAMICS OF THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because she was interested in my ideas, she was reading my books,
and whenever I was passing through New Delhi, she always tried to meet
me and discuss with me. She always agreed with what I said to her, but
she said, "I know what you are saying is right, but I cannot do it" --
because this whole political game is so dirty that if you want to be at
the top, you have to follow the whole cunning, hypocritical style.</p><p>Q: WERE THERE PROBLEMS BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER MINISTERS OR DEPARTMENTS
OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT?</p><p>A: Yes. With Morarji Desai I have been enemies for many lives. Q: WAS
THAT A KEY FACTOR IN YOUR LEAVING INDIA?</p><p>A: No. I remained in India until he was no longer the prime minister.
I had made it a point that while he is the prime minister, I was not
going outside India. I was hammering him every day, hitting him every
day, for the simple reason -- I am not a politician, I am not a
competitor to anybody -- that I can't see stupid things happening.</p><p>Q: WHAT WAS YOUR QUARREL WITH DESAI?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Everything -- because I was against his political master, Mahatma
Gandhi. I am against the whole philosophy of Gandhiism because it drags
people backwards. It is not a forwards movement; it does not take
account of the future. It adores, and teaches people to adore, the dead
past. He was not ready to accept anything that was invented after the
spinning wheel. For him the spinning wheel was the last human invention,
for him time had stopped there. This is stupid. On the spinning wheel
you cannot keep your country clothed. If a person spins for eight hours
every day, then he will be able to have enough clothes just for
himself.</p><p>Now this is an idiotic ideology. If a person spins eight hours, then
when is he going to earn his food? How is he going to take care of his
children, his wife, his old parents? How is he going to have a roof?
Gandhi was against simple things: telegraph, telephone, railway. Just
think.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT HAVEN'T YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE
DEVELOPED THAT'S GOTTEN US INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF A HOLOCAUST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have said it, but I have said it from a totally different
direction. I say it is technology that has disturbed the whole harmony
of nature. Now it is the duty of technology to put it back. Nobody else
can do it. I am not against technology; I am simply against the
technology which has been growing blindly, unconsciously, unaware of its
effects. I would like a better technology, superior to the technology we
have, which takes care of nature and human beings. Our whole technology
has developed as an effort to destroy.</p><p>Q: BUT NO ONE'S EVER FOUND A WAY TO PUT A CAP ON SCIENCE, HAVE THEY?
I MEAN, IT HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It has NOT a life of its own. It is politically dominated. No
scientist can manage a nuclear plant. The nuclear plant is owned by the
American</p><p>government or the Soviet Union or some other idiots, and the
scientist has to work under the direction of the politicians. This
technology has not developed independently. Scientists are simply the
servants of the politicians; and the moment they start just a little to
do something on their own, their careers are finished. In the ancient
days it was difficult and different. It was difficult to create all that
technology is now creating because it needed a certain background which
was not available. Second, it was simpler for a scientist to work
independently in his own small lab. Galileo was independent, Copernicus
was independent, but not Albert Einstein.</p><p>Q: BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT, DO YOU REALLY SEE A WAY TO PUT THE NUCLEAR
GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE WHEN EVEN GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
TO MAKE A NUCLEAR BOMB TODAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no need to put it back. Any energy which can be
destructive can also be creative. It is only a question of application.
The nuclear weapons are meant to destroy. The whole science is motivated
towards a third world war. The same energy that is being put into making
these weapons and these new discoveries can be put into creative ways.
There is no need for Ethiopia to starve and die.</p><p>Q: DOES THIS PUT YOU ON THE SIDE OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not to destroy -- but the energy can be used in a creative way,
and the sooner we realize it, the better. All governments should be
forced by the people to see that atomic, nuclear, or any kind of energy
that is in the service of war, has to be released into the service of
humanity to destroy hunger, poverty, unemployment. We can make this
earth for the first time a paradise. It will be really so foolish to
have so much energy in our hands and destroy the earth, destroy all
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN GO ABOUT CHANGING THE PRESENT ATTITUDE IN
THE WORLD TO CREATE THIS SORT OF FUTURE THAT YOU SEE?</p><p>A: The people just have to be made more alert and aware. They have to
be made conscious of what their politicians are doing. And once the
politicians see that the masses are no more for war, they will
immediately jump ahead of the masses. That's a necessity for being a
political leader -- you have to be ahead of the crowd. It is not that
the crowd follows you, it is just the opposite. The politician has to
keep alert to where the crowd is going, and the successful politician is
one who always keeps himself ahead of the masses. The unsuccessful
politician is</p><p>one who goes on without looking back to see that the followers have
taken some other route.</p><p>It is very simple. Just the people -- the media, all kinds of
newspapers and magazines, the universities where intelligence exists --
should start a campaign for consciousness raising. It is not a question
of one person, it is a question of life being destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT CREATING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT
MANKIND?</p><p>A: I am trying. I am trying in my own way. I have more than half a
million sannyasins around the world who are trying in every possible way
to raise human consciousness. Perhaps nobody else is doing what I am
doing and on such a vast scale. My methods of meditation are in reality
sabotaging the political structure that exists anywhere today. If people
meditate, they become more rebellious, they become more understanding.
Their eyes see more clearly. Their consciousness is on a far higher
level. They can become teachers to those who are lagging a little
behind. They can help them.</p><p>Within ten years it is possible we can make humanity alert and aware
of their own politicians. American politicians are making Americans
aware of the danger of Soviet Russia; Soviet politicians are making
Soviet citizens alert to the danger that America is. Americans have to
be made aware of the danger of their own politicians. Russians have to
try to become aware. I have my sannyasins there --</p><p>of course, they are all underground. Q: HOW MANY IN RUSSIA?</p><p>A: I cannot give you the number. I cannot give you the names. The
Russian government is already persecuting the people they have found
with my books. A few Russians have escaped and they are here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE THERE OTHER LEADERS TODAY THAT YOU FEEL ARE WORKING IN THE
SAME DIRECTION YOU ARE? OR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS
ALONE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is nobody. Political leaders cannot do it; it would be
suicidal on their part. They would lose all power. The so-called
religious leaders have been in deep conspiracy with the politicians for
centuries. They are afraid that if people become more alert, more
conscious, then who is going to bother about their God? And who is going
to believe that there is a God?</p><p>There have been two religions in India devoted to meditation: Jainism
and Buddhism. Both deny the existence of God, for the simple reason that
when your consciousness becomes clear, you can see that this God and the
creation of the</p><p>world is all fiction. The religious leaders are afraid of a person
like me. They are afraid of my sannyasins. They are afraid because among
my sannyasins there are Hindus, there are Mohammedans, Sikhs, Christians
and Jews. And of course the moment they become my sannyasins, they have
to leave their Jewishness, their Christianity, outside. They cannot
bring it in. Naturally the religious leaders will be afraid.</p><p>I am the only person who is condemned by all religious leaders, all
political parties. Strange: a single person is being condemned by all
those who are against each other. Even communists are against me,
socialists are against me. A few days ago, I received a letter from the
president of the American Nazi party: "You are hurting our religious
feelings by speaking against Adolf Hitler." He told me in the letter
that Adolf Hitler was not a politician, he was the reincarnation of the
ancient Old Testament prophet Elijah. Now do you think these are the
people who are going to raise people's consciousness? They are
exploiting people in the name of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AS I RECALL YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, YOU MENTIONED
EUGENICS AS A WAY IN WHICH WE COULD AVOID CREATING OTHER MONSTERS SUCH
AS HITLER, STALIN, AND GENGHIS KHAN. IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p>A: Yes, it is right.</p><p>Q: BUT WHEN YOU INTRUDE INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES TO TELL THEM WHEN AND HOW
THEY CAN HAVE CHILDREN, ISN'T THAT SOMEWHAT FASCISTIC, SOMEWHAT
HITLERIAN IN ITSELF?</p><p>A: No. If you can operate on their cancer, is that Hitlerian? When
the doctor says, "Take this medicine for your tuberculosis," is he
intruding in your life? Is that fascist? You are entering in everybody's
life in every way, but because eugenics is something new, people freak
out.</p><p>In fact, a couple making love has no idea what kind of a child they
are going to produce. This is blind biology. It is better to be in the
hands of scientists than to be in the hands of blind biology. We can
conceive that there can be exploitation, but that is true about any
invention, any discovery, any new thing. But I am totally in favor of
it, because I see it can really change man even though he has not
changed in thousands of years. Since the first monkeys jumped on the
earth and started walking on two legs, man is the same. Yes, he wears
better clothes, flies in airplanes, but just scratch a little bit and
you will find the monkey there.</p><p>Q: IF YOU'LL PARDON A COUPLE OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS, HAVE YOU NEVER
WANTED TO HAVE A CHILD YOURSELF?</p><p>A: No, for the simple reason that I don't want to burden this earth.
It is already burdened too much. There is no religious reason why my
sannyasins are not giving birth to children. In the four years we have
been here, not a single baby has been born. And nowhere is so much love
being made as is made here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE'S BEEN A STORY RECENTLY THAT YOU PLAN TO RETURN TO INDIA AND
TO MOVE THIS COMMUNE BACK TO INDIA. IS THERE ANY TRUTH IN THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I go on creating many kinds of rumors; they are part of my work.
But I am not going anywhere. I am going to remain here.</p><p>Q: WHY ARE YOU DETERMINED TO REMAIN HERE, INASMUCH AS YOU SEEM VERY
CRITICAL AND UNFAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARD THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AND THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because I want to spread that idea. I need to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANY REASON THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY INDIAN SANNYASINS HERE
IN OREGON?</p><p>A: Only a few are here... not many. There were not many even when I
was in India, for the simple reason that what I am saying goes against
their conditioned minds, and they have the oldest conditioned minds in
the world. They are so much conditioned over thousands of years that
they have become incapable even of listening to anything new. They
believe that everything that is true is in their scriptures, that there
is no need for anything new. The old is gold. The older it is, the
golder it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WERE YOU EVER A PRACTICING HINDU?</p><p>A: Never, never. I have never been practicing any religion. I have
been trying to remain an individual on my own, right or wrong, heaven or
hell. I have never considered about anything. I want to remain
completely myself. It gives a certain strength, freedom, dignity; and
that's my teaching to my people. It is not a religion -- it is just the
gathering of people who feel some similarity, some synchronicity. But
each is respected as an individual.</p><p>This commune is not an organization, it is an organism just like the
body. They are all working on their own responsibility. There is nobody
higher, nobody lower; there is no hierarchy. The professor and the
plumber are equally respected and loved. In fact, nobody even bothers
whether you are a plumber or a professor. Nobody even asks anybody,
"What are you doing?" because</p><p>everybody is doing what is needed. So all are equal; they are
fulfilling the needs of the commune in different ways, in the way they
can fulfill.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE THING THAT BRINGS YOU ALL
TOGETHER?</p><p>A: I had not come here to stay. I had come here because my health was
bad. My back was so bad that we tried everything.… Experts from England
were called but they could not fix it. I was suffering from asthma so
much that sleep became difficult. I am allergic to all kinds of perfume,
smoke, dust; any small thing immediately triggers my coughing and then
it goes on for hours.</p><p>Otherwise, why should I choose Oregon? It is a desert, dry. Humidity
is dangerous for me. Whenever I went to Bombay, attacks of asthma would
immediately increase. And whenever I went to the desert part of India,
Rajasthan, it would settle down. That gave me the clue that it is not a
question of medicines; I had to find some desert place, and big enough.
For simple reasons.… If I was living in the city and at somebody's house
they were having a fire or celebrating a Hindu festival with
firecrackers, that was enough to trouble me. You cannot stop them just
for my allergy. So I needed a big place, and this place is big enough.
It is 126 square miles.</p><p>My sannyasins know what my troubles are, so they don't do anything
that can trouble me. And the climate is dry. I had never come here with
the intention to stay. I came only so that I could get healthier, and I
have been getting healthier. I am far better than I was there, but my
troubles are such that they can be triggered any moment. You just come
here and you have been smoking, that is enough. You are not smoking
here, just talking, and if I get the smell of tobacco, you have done
it.</p><p>So it has become a problem. My Indian commune is there. They are
waiting for me; but I know that if I go back the same problem will arise
again. I was 180 pounds when I came; now I am 132 pounds. Just the dry
climate helped me to reduce the weight without any difficulty.</p><p>So I am going to be here. And I am not a person to just sit and watch
whatsoever goes on, because I don't think America belongs only to
Americans and India belongs only to Indians. This whole earth belongs to
us. I am feeling perfectly good here, healthwise, so I am not going to
leave.</p><p>Secondly, I am feeling immensely interested by the hostility of
Oregonians. For thirty years in India I had been hammering people. By
and by they became accustomed to me, to my criticism. These people are
new and they are really getting disturbed, and I am getting great joy
out of it!</p><p>Q: YOU APPARENTLY ARE THE HEAD OF A VERY RICH WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION.
WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON ANY OBLIGATION YOU MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO
WORLD CHARITY? TO THE FAMINE</p><p>COUNTRIES? TO POVERTY IN INDIA? TO THE MANY OTHER PLACES THAT NEED
HELP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: First, I am not the head of a worldwide organization. I am not
even a sannyasin. Nothing is in my hands; it is my sannyasins' business.
I am simly a guest.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FEELING ABOUT IT THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My personal feeling is that there should be no more preparation
for future war. And all the nations who are putting seventy-five percent
of their energy and income into making new weapons, should move all that
energy to help those who need it. I don't have anything to give to
Ethiopia, because I don't possess anything.</p><p>Q: DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WISHED TO HELP ETHIOPIA, YOUR
SANNYASINS WOULD COMPLY WITH YOUR WISHES AND RENDER HELP?</p><p>A: No. I would not wish it either. This should be the work of the
politicians and the religious leaders. They should take the
responsibility -- I have nothing to do with it. In fact, if people had
listened to me, India would not have been poor. For thirty years I was
saying to them, "Go for birth control. Abortion should be made legal" --
and I was condemned for that. They were throwing stones and shoes and
knives at me for teaching them immorality.</p><p>So I don't feel responsible if they are starving. It is their doing.
Anybody who is dying and starving should remember that the whole crime
is due to people like the pope, Mother Teresa, and other religious
leaders who are against birth control, against abortion. They are
increasing the population of the world, and they are getting Nobel
prizes. Mother Teresa should be hanged!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE WORLD HUNGER IS A RESULT OF MISGUIDED
POLICIES ON THE PART OF WORLD LEADERS, WHAT ABOUT HUMAN COMPASSION FOR
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STARVING? -- SIMPLE HUMAN COMPASSION.</p><p>A: If you really want to know the truth, I say just send medical
groups to help the Ethiopians die peacefully if you cannot provide food
and clothes. And how long are you going to provide? Ethiopia has been
starving and dying for four years continuously, and those dying
Ethiopians are still creating children.</p><p>The people who have increased the population of the world by their
teachings should take the responsibility and feed those people; or, if
they are incapable, my suggestion is that rather than starving,
suffering, dying, it is better to give them</p><p>an injection so they can go peacefully into eternal sleep. And I know
the soul never dies, so I am not worried about anything. They will be
incarnated somewhere else, and next time they will find something better
than Ethiopia.</p><p>Q: YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION, THEN?</p><p>A: I know. I don't believe.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD THAT BE PART OF YOUR INDIAN HERITAGE, SINCE IT IS A STRONG
BELIEF AMONG INDIANS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. It is not because they believe. I have tried to find it. It is
not my belief, I never accept any belief. It only covers your ignorance,
it never makes you wise. I have meditated; I have come to a point where
I can see my own past lives, and that's proof enough. It is my knowing,
my experiencing; it is nothing to do with Indian heritage, beliefs, or
anything. I speak on my own authority.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE OFTEN EXPRESSED A VIEW OF A COMING WORLD APOCALYPSE IF MAN
DOESN'T CHANGE HIS OUTLOOK. IS THAT VIEW OF AN APOCALYPSE SOMETHING
THAT'S RATIONALIZED FROM AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORY AND CURRENT EVENTS, OR
IS IT A VISION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is an analysis of man's whole past. The way man has been
functioning -- continuously unconscious, fighting, violent -- one day it
will come to its ultimate logical conclusion. And it is coming. After
the second world war, you cannot have the first world war -- you can
only have a third world war. It is not a vision, I am not a visionary. I
can calculate the way nuclear weapons are growing. In 1945 the first
atom bomb was used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Within just forty years
our power of destruction is seven hundred times more, and it is growing
every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU WOULD CALL YOURSELF A RATIONALIST ABOUT THIS, THEN?</p><p>A: Absolutely.</p><p>Q: AND YOUR ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS A WORLD EPIDEMIC OF SOME DISEASE
-- POSSIBLY AIDS, I BELIEVE YOU SAID.</p><p>A: Yes. It is also part of all that man has done to nature, to man,
to animals, to everything. He has created the situation.</p><p>For example, in my childhood in India -- and it is not long, just
fifty years ago -- the seasons used to come exactly the same day each
year. India has three clear- cut seasons. Every year winter starts at
the same time, disappears at the same</p><p>time. Since 1945 it has not been so. Now the seasons are not
predictable. Some great disturbance has shaken the routine of millions
of years. The water is polluted, the air is polluted; it is really a
miracle that we are still surviving. So it is simply a rational analysis
that if we don't change human consciousness by the end of this century,
the chapter of life on this earth closes forever.</p><p>Q: I BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE ALSO PREDICTED A TERRIBLE FLOOD. WHAT
REASONS DO YOU SEE FOR THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That, too.… All around the world even poor and small nations are
experimenting with atomic energy, even India. People are starving,
dying, and India is exporting its wheat -- for what? Your people are
dying. They have been producing the wheat, they will not get even one
meal a day, and you are exporting wheat. Naturally, the government will
have to impose an emergency, because how long can people tolerate that
they are dying and their food is being exported? But India is exporting
because money is needed for more nuclear plants, atomic bombs. All that
India has is farming. Eighty percent of Indians are farmers; they can
only sell their raw product. And they will be purchasing death. So if
great explosions go on happening, it is scientifically estimated how
many explosions will start melting the eternal snow of the Himalayas.
And even just the Himalayas melting is enough to drown India completely,
because the height of the ocean will rise fifty feet, and cities like
Bombay will have no future. And this is only about the Himalayan ice. If
the ice of the north pole and the south pole starts getting heated and
they start melting, then you can understand.…</p><p>It is a man-made calamity. And there is still time to stop, because
it has not happened yet. I am not a prophet in the sense that I am a
visionary. I don't support all that rubbish.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DO HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS, THOUGH.
IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't have any faith in him. The fact is that the man was crazy,
and what he has written can be interpreted in any way you want. I found
this rational analysis and managed to look into Nostradamus, and found
similarities, which was very easy. There are many books of that kind in
the world.</p><p>In India there is an ancient scripture thought to be written by Vyasa
himself, five thousand years ago. Everything about you is written in it.
You just have to go to the priest, you have to give your name, your
birth time, your birth chart, and he will figure it out and find the
right page where Vyasa has described you. And it is possible because in
the Sanskrit language, each word has at least one dozen meanings. So
looking at you, watching you, talking with you, the scholar will figure
it out, and he will start reading from the scripture. And he will be
very much correct.</p><p>Copies of the scripture exist all over India; so you have it done in
Delhi but if you are not satisfied -- who knows if it is right or wrong?
-- you can go to Madras or Calcutta, and they will find the same page
again. And because in the process of finding the page the clue is given
by you, you can just change your name. Go to</p><p>Delhi, tell one name, one date of birth; in Madras, tell another
name, another time of birth and you will know what is going on. He will
not be able to find the same page. He will find some other page. But
ordinarily, the type of people who go will not do this. They are
immensely impressed.</p><p>Nostradamus can be interpreted in any way you want. The sentences are
not clear, the grammar is not correct. The words are such that you can
fit them into any context you want.</p><p>Q: BUT HAVEN'T YOU USED HIM AS THE SOURCE OF THE PREDICTION THAT THIS
DREAD DISEASE WOULD SWEEP THE EARTH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I use all kinds of devices. If people are foolish, I can use
even their foolishness to raise their consciousness. I don't feel any
problem in it. If I was predicting on my own they would not listen to
it, so I drag in Nostradamus. And that's what I have been doing my whole
life. If I speak to Christians -- I have been speaking to Christians in
India; they have the biggest theological college in Jabalpur where I was
for twenty years -- and I was speaking on Jesus, I was simply speaking
on myself. Just here and there I would have to put Jesus' name, and they
were immensely happy; not only happy, they said, 'We have never heard
any Christian, any theologian, finding the true meaning of Jesus." I
said, "Yes, how can they find the true meaning of Jesus?"</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD, IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't believe in anything. Belief is simply not part of my
vocabulary. Belief simply means you don't know, yet you believe. A blind
man believing in light -- what can that belief do? He does not need a
prophet, a messiah; he needs medicine, a surgeon, perhaps an operation
on his eyes, so that he can see.</p><p>And do you believe in light? Nobody asks such questions -- you know
light is there. The question of belief is asked only when the thing is
non-existential. You cannot see it, you cannot touch it, you cannot feel
it. God is a belief, heaven is a belief, hell is a belief The reason why
you believe in these things is within your psychology; the priest is
only exploiting. You have greed for immortality, you have greed for
paradise and all the pleasures there. You have fear of death, you have
fear of falling into the darkness of hell and all the tortures there.
Naturally you start believing, because you don't want to go to hell, you
want to go to heaven.</p><p>It is because of this psychology that an idiot like Reverend Jim
Jones managed the suicide of his whole commune. He persuaded them to die
with him, because if they died with him, they would all enter into
heaven. This is the logical conclusion of Jesus' telling his disciples,
'I will take you into heaven." Jim Jones went a little farther. He was
really a great Christian! -- after Jesus only he is the prophet.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF GOD EXISTED, GOD WOULD REVEAL HIMSELF IN
SOME TANGIBLE WAY?</p><p>A: There is no God, and there is no question of his revelation. I
don't see any possibility of God's existence. I can understand the
existence of consciousness, because it is within me and I can experience
it. And in my silent moments of awareness, I have never come across any
God, any hell, any heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS RAJNEESHISM A RELIGION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. It is a religionless religion. It is simply religiousness. Q:
DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A PROPHET?</p><p>A: No. I am not so stupid. I don't consider myself in any way
special, extraordinary, a messenger of God, a prophet, a messiah. No. I
am just an ordinary human being like you and everybody else.</p><p>Q: I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR ULTIMATE AIMS HERE
IN OREGON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I never think of tomorrow... and you are asking about the ultimate
aim!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, SIR, I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME COME HERE TO VISIT
YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I loved it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE, AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Whenever you feel like coming, come. Q: THANKS VERY MUCH.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-13>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 24.]</p><p>Laura Parker</p><p>POST INTELLIGENCER SEATTLE, WASHINGTON</p><p>QUESTION: HELLO. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS WRITE A STORY PROFILING
YOU. THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF READERS IN THE SEATTLE AREA WHO ARE NOT
AS FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMUNE OR WITH YOU AS THE NEWSPAPER READERS ARE IN
OREGON, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND IN
ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT RAJNEESHISM. I
GUESS WE COULD START WITH: WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK, AND WHY DID YOU
DECIDE TO SPEAK TO REPORTERS?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: I have never asked any "why" in my life. I simply do anything
that I feel like doing. I am not a man of thinking. I function through
my feelings. If I feel to stop speaking, I can stop in the middle of a
sentence, I will not even complete the sentence. And if I want to speak,
even from my grave I will continue.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THAT.…</p><p>A: Even from my grave, I will continue to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THE MEDIA THAT YOU
COULDN'T SAY THROUGH YOUR DISCOURSES OR BOOKS? DO THE REPORTERS CARRY A
MESSAGE TO THE AUDIENCE IN AMERICA FOR YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. Whatever I can say to my people, I say to them; but
that is not going to reach to the people outside the commune. I would
like them to be acquainted with what is happening here, and not to
depend on rumors. I would like to invite them to be our guests, see our
people, and see that there is a different way of life, too.</p><p>Q: IS THERE ANY WAY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT COME HERE COULD UNDERSTAND
THIS WAY OF LIFE?</p><p>A: It is almost impossible, because there are things which can only
be experienced and cannot be explained. In fact, if you try to explain
them, you explain them away.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANY WAY THE PEOPLE IN OREGON. WILL THERE EVER BE</p><p>PEACE HERE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN OREGON WHO ARE SO OPPOSED TO THE
RAJNEESHEES, AND THE COMMUNE HERE OR THE RANCH HERE? DO YOU SEE THAT
EVER HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't think of the future at all. Right now we are enjoying
their opposition, their hostility, because this is the beginning of
friendship. If they had ignored us, then I would have had to think of
something.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE? IF THEY HAD IGNORED YOU, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN WORSE, THEN, THE HOSTILITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I would have created something so that they could not ignore.
I can accept their hate, their hostility, their opposition; but I cannot
accept their ignoring us, because it is easier to transform the hate
into love, hostility into friendship. But there is no way to communicate
with someone who is ignoring you. The people of Oregon have proved
really receptive.</p><p>Q: IF WE COULD GO BACK TO INDIA, AND WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.… I HAVE
READ SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, BUT I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT
IT. COULD YOU TELL ME I</p><p>HAVE HEARD THAT YOU LIVED WITH SHEELA'S FAMILY FOR A WHILE, AND I
HAVE READ THAT YOU LIVED WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS AS A YOUNG BOY. I'M NOT
CERTAIN WHICH IS ACCURATE. COULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD?</p><p>A: Yes. My early childhood, up to six or seven, I was with my
maternal grandfather and grandmother. I loved the place. It was a very
small village surrounded by lush greenery and the house of my
grandfather was just on the bank of a beautiful lake. After that, for
three years I lived with Sheela's father. He loved me not like a small
boy, but just like a contemporary friend.</p><p>It was a strange relationship -- he loved me, he respected me, too,
which is very rare. I loved him, that was nothing new; I respected him,
but I respected him more because he could respect a child just like a
friend. And for three years it</p><p>was a tremendous experience, because I could never communicate or
relate with my own age group. I had never played any game in my life. It
all looked stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EVEN AS A VERY SMALL CHILD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Never. As far back as I can remember, I loved only one game -- to
argue. Q: TO ARGUE?</p><p>A: To argue... about everything. So very few grownup people could
stand me. Understanding was out of the question. In Sheela's father, I
found a man who was ready to understand me, and I never felt that he was
tired or bored or not ready to answer. He never tried to shut me up. He
never told me a single time, "These things you will understand only when
you are grown up." If he did not know something, he accepted it: I don't
know it, I am searching as you are searching. If in argument he could
not convince me, and my argument was weightier than his, he was able to
accept it without feeling insulted, humiliated. He is a man of
tremendous understanding, caring, and our relationship has remained the
same. Now he is my sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THIS WAS WHEN YOU WERE TEN YOU LIVED WITH HIM, APPROXIMATELY?</p><p>A: It must have been nearabout... between six to nine.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID HE SEND YOU TO SCHOOL? WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING
YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Because I was never interested in going to school. That was
the worst place. I was forced finally to go, but I resisted as much as I
could, because there were only children who were not interested in
things I was interested in and I was not interested in things they all
were interested in. So I was an outsider.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WERE YOU INTERESTED IN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My interest has remained the same: to know what is the ultimate
truth, what is the meaning of life, why I am here and not anyone else.
And I was determined that unless I find the answer, I am not going to
rest, and I am not going to let anybody around me rest, either.</p><p>So he was teaching me at home, because he loved me; if I did not want
to go to school, then he would teach me at home. After living with him
for three years, finally I had to go back to my house, because he --
Sheela's father -- left for England for his further studies.</p><p>Q: YOUR FATHER WAS A MERCHANT, IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He was a cloth merchant, and that's how he came in contact with
Sheela's father. Sheela's father lived in Bombay, and my father used to
come to Bombay for his business. And they immediately became almost like
twins.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN YOU WENT TO SCHOOL, YOU WERE OLDER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was older than any child.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DID THE OTHER CHILDREN IN SCHOOL TREAT YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Then they were afraid of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY WERE AFRAID OF YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They were afraid... and since then everybody is afraid. The
students were afraid, the teachers were afraid.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BECAUSE OF THE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING, OR BECAUSE OF YOUR
ARGUING?</p><p>A: My argument was their greatest problem. They never accepted any
argument from children.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEN YOU WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Later on I was in the university, but.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DID YOU CONTINUE IN SCHOOL AND GO THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU
DIDN'T...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I wanted to fight with everyone... from the primary school to the
university. And I wanted to know if all these knowledgeable people have
something in them, or it is all borrowed. And I found that all they had
was borrowed: not a single teacher or professor had any experience of
his own.</p><p>Q: WHEN YOU WERE STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY, WAS THERE ANYONE WHO YOU
READ, OR ANYONE WHO YOU FOLLOWED? -- I DON'T MEAN A TEACHER, BUT PERHAPS
SOMEONE WHOSE WRITING THAT YOU PARTICULARLY READ?</p><p>A: No.… I have read so much that perhaps nobody in the whole world
can compete. My own personal library slowly, slowly became so big that
the day I left India it had 150,000 rare books. I have read VASTLY; in
fact, it is difficult to mention the name of any book that I have not
read.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I THINK I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU STOPPED READING AT SOME
POINT.</p><p>A: For the past five years I have not read anything.</p><p>Q: FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not even a newspaper, no magazine, no book. I simply stopped
reading because I understood that all those books are just rubbish. You
can be lost in the jungle of words, but you are not going to get any
truth out of those books.</p><p>That was the time when I started feeling to go into silence for a
group of years, just to give a gap, so that the life that I had lived
before silence becomes completely separated from me. It is now
completely separated from me. Now whatsoever I say, I say on my own
authority. I say only that which I know. I don't believe in anything. I
don't quote anybody unless he coincides with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID YOU MEET SHEELA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Sheela's father was not even married when I started living with
him. He got married after three months. Sheela came long afterwards. But
Sheela's father has been trying to bring all his children to me, he
wanted them not to miss me. His two sons are sannyasins, all his
daughters are sannyasins. Sheela was studying in America for about ten
years before. She was not interested in any search for truth, she was
not aware that there is something to seek in life.</p><p>When she came to me, she was almost a TABULA RASA, a clean sheet,
nothing written on her. That helped her immensely. Once she came to me,
she never left. And because she was open, clean, without any prejudice,
she could understand me immediately. Her understanding has not been any
mental effort on her side... she simply absorbed me. She ate every word
that I uttered to her.</p><p>Q: YOU TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY, IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY? AND YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR
TWENTIES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: DESCRIBE THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE A TEACHER AND WHAT YOU WERE
TRYING TO TEACH TO YOUR STUDENTS WHILE YOU WERE AT THE UNIVERSITY.</p><p>A: It was a very difficult situation. I was teaching my students
everything that the university prescribed, and I was also teaching them
how much in this prescribed teaching is bogus and bullshit. So it was a
difficult job... I was teaching Aristotle and at the same time I was
teaching them that Aristotle is not right. So my period was divided in
two sections: first I would teach them what Aristotle means, and then I
would say that he is wrong, that as far as I am concerned Aristotle has
been a great calamity for humanity.</p><p>So I was complained against because this was a strange way of
teaching, and the students were getting confused. They used to ask me:
"What are we going to answer in the examination?" I said that they had
to choose: If you feel Aristotle is right, it is up to you; if you feel
I am right, it is up to you. If you feel we both are wrong and you are
right, it is up to you. Choose. And I also recommended to the
vice-chancellor not to bother about these complaints, because I am
giving them a challenge, and it is the challenge to the mind that
sharpens it.</p><p>Q: AND WHAT DID THE VICE-CHANCELLOR SAY TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He said to me that those students had not come to know the truth,
they had come only to earn a degree. I told the vice-chancellor, "Then
accept my resignation, because I have not come here to make students
clerks, teachers, station masters, postmasters... I am not interested in
their degrees and examinations. My whole interest is to sharpen a
student's intelligence, make him an individual, unprejudiced, open,
available to reality." And I resigned.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THEY ACCEPTED YOUR RESIGNATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They tried not to accept it. They tried to persuade me, but this
is not my way. Once I have done anything I never go back. I told them,
"I can feel your concern for me, I can feel your respect and love for
me, but once I have resigned, it is finished. Now I will be a wandering
teacher."</p><p>Then for almost twenty years I was just a wandering teacher around
the country and I found that it was foolish wasting time in the
university teaching twenty students. When I can teach fifty thousand
people in one single meeting, what is the point of wasting time in the
university? So I have not been at a loss. From the university I moved to
the universe.</p><p>Q: I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY READERS UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. YOU BECAME
ENLIGHTENED WHEN YOU WERE IN YOUR VERY EARLY TWENTIES, AND THEN YOU
BECAME A TEACHER AFTER THAT. IS THAT</p><p>CORRECT? -- AND THEN TRAVELED AFTER THAT. COULD YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME
WHEN YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, AND HOW THAT OCCURRED?</p><p>A: Enlightenment simply means an experience of your consciousness
unclouded by thoughts, emotions, sentiments. When the consciousness is
totally empty, there is something like an explosion, an atomic
explosion. Your whole insight becomes full of a light which has no
source and no cause. And once it has happened, it remains. It never
leaves you for a single moment; even when you are asleep, that light is
inside. And after that moment you can see things in a totally different
way. After that experience, there is no question in you.</p><p>So for twenty-one years I was continuously questioning people, and
after that day I have been continually answering people. I don't have
any questions.</p><p>Q: WHAT WAS THAT DAY LIKE? WHAT WAS THE DAY LIKE WHEN YOU BECAME
ENLIGHTENED? I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS TO PEOPLE WHO, AS I
SAY, ARE NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH BECOMING ENLIGHTENED.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It will be difficult for them to understand. Because when that
experience happens, there are no words, no thoughts; and when you want
to express it, obviously words are needed, thoughts are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WERE YOU A STUDENT AT THE TIME?</p><p>A: I was a student.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID YOU SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. For seven years, I kept completely silent about it because I
was waiting for somebody to recognize it -- perhaps I had gone mad,
perhaps it was just insanity. I wanted somebody to recognize it, and
there were a few people who started recognizing that something had
happened which is rare and unique.</p><p>The first man to recognize was an old man who was almost silent for
his whole life. Once in a while he would utter a word -- meaningless,
you could not make anything out of it, but he was respected immensely.
His name was Magga Baba. People used to come to him from faraway places,
and he never spoke. To have a contact with that man people used to
massage his feet and just sit around him. He might be sleeping and
people would be sitting around him, because there was something
radiating from that man, something that they could feel like a
fragrance.</p><p>The first day I went to see him, he immediately hugged me and
whispered in my ear, "My boy, so you have got it... and it is good that
you have not told anybody.</p><p>Wait for the right moment to tell, because it immediately creates
opposition, antagonism, and you are too young... you may not be able to
fight. So just wait a little."</p><p>Q: COULD SHEELA'S FATHER TELL? A: No.</p><p>Q: DID YOU SEE HIM AFTER YOU BECAME ENLIGHTENED, BUT BEFORE YOU HAD
TOLD PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. The moment I met him afterwards, he immediately became a
sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID THAT THE OTHER MAN TOLD YOU TO WAIT UNTIL THE RIGHT
MOMENT. WHEN WAS THAT MOMENT? WHEN DID YOU TELL?</p><p><br></p><p>A: When he told me, it must have been... I must have been
twenty-eight. And once that old man had recognized it, I slowly started
speaking about it. And soon I was in the world fighting, arguing against
anything that prevents people from becoming enlightened.</p><p>So I have been fighting all the religions, all the politicians, all
the educationists; and the more I have fought them, the more I have
attracted intelligent people around the world towards me. My people are
not like Jesus' apostles. My people are professors, engineers, doctors,
writers, poets, musicians, painters, dancers. I</p><p>have the most talented group in the whole world.</p><p>Q: DESCRIBE FOR ME WHEN YOU WERE TRAVELING AROUND INDIA LECTURING.…
WHERE DID YOU GO, WHAT WAS THE RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM THE
GROUPS. ?</p><p>A: It was different in different places, in different groups. For
example, I was lecturing in different universities in India -- and India
has almost one hundred universities. The students were the ones who got
the point most. I was teaching in religious conferences. The people who
gathered to listen got the point, but the organizers, the religious
leaders, became my enemies.</p><p>So any conference, any gathering of religious people I have visited
only once, I was not invited there again. Just in one visit I had
disturbed their people so much, stirred so many doubts and questions in
their minds. Because this is one of my basic standpoints: the way to
truth is not belief, but doubt; not faith, but inquiry.</p><p>Because of this I say religion and science start from the same point,
although their directions are different. Science moves towards the
objective world, but its basic foundation is doubt. Doubt everything
unless you come across something</p><p>which is indubitable. And religion moves inwards; but the basic point
remains the same: Doubt, and go on doubting unless you come across
something that even when you try to doubt it -- it is there in front of
you -- all your doubts disappear.</p><p>So to me science and religion both meet at a certain point, the
beginning. And if it is understood, it will not be difficult to help
them to meet at the end, too. And it will be a great day of rejoicing
when science and religion become fellow travelers.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID YOU START THE ASHRAM IN POONA? DID THAT COME MUCH
LATER?</p><p>A: Much later in '73.</p><p>Q: SO YOU TRAVELED AROUND INDIA FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. I continuously went.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DID YOU STOP TRAVELING AND START THE ASHRAM?</p><p>A: Traveling, I was trying to find people who are ready to go with me
to any end. The moment I became aware that I had enough people in India,
that I need not bother to go on traveling, I could now settle in one
place and let people come to me.… As I became settled, Indians came...
and soon people from around the world slowly, slowly started coming.</p><p>In Poona, there were ten thousand sannyasins living with me. It was a
strange place, almost like an island; ten thousand people of different
nations, races, colors, languages, and Indians themselves became a
minority group. The moment they saw that what I am teaching and saying
is not propagating Hinduism, I am not propagating anybody's religion, I
have got my own experience. The Hindu mind is the oldest mind and the
most rotten, of course;</p><p>it is so full of conditionings. When the people from the West came to
me they were less conditioned -- particularly the young people. To have
a communion with them was far more easy.</p><p>So I don't see any difference between Poona and Rajneeshpuram. In
Poona, I was among non-Indians; in Rajneeshpuram, I am among
non-Indians.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WAS THE ASHRAM LARGE ENOUGH? OR DID YOU WANT TO EXPAND AT THAT
POINT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I wanted to expand it. It was large enough, but not large enough
for the people who were going on coming. There were two thousand
sannyasins living in the ashram itself, and the remaining eight thousand
were living in hotels, guest houses, in other people's houses. The whole
of Poona was overflooded</p><p>with sannyasins, and I wanted all of them to live together because
they had been continuously cheated by people.</p><p>Indians proclaim themselves very religious That is just nonsense;
they are the</p><p>most materialist people on the earth. Rents went ten times higher as
soon as they saw many foreigners coming. Prices of everything went high.
In the market, if an Indian was purchasing a thing there was a different
price; and if a sannyasin, a foreigner, was purchasing the same thing,
it was ten times more. When I had started the ashram a huge bungalow
with two acres of garden around it was available at $20,000. Soon it
became impossible. even $100,000 was not enough.</p><p>People were asking absurd prices. Q: FOR ADDITIONAL LAND?</p><p>A: For land, for houses, for food, for everything We were searching
for land in India somewhere else; but the Maharashtra government would
not allow me to leave Maharashtra. They had found a strategy to prevent
me: one, that any property, any land, any house that we purchased was
never allowed to be transferred into our names. Even now.…</p><p>Q: SAY THAT AGAIN. ?</p><p>A: Any property, any land, any house that we purchased, the
Maharashtra government did not transfer it to our name.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Simply so that we could not sell it. And we had invested so much
money there that unless we could sell, it was difficult for us to move.
So this was their one strategy. Now, even now, those properties are not
in the name of the commune -- because still the commune exists there.
And the second strategy was they were forcing the central government
that we should not be allowed land anywhere else. The reason was that
they were earning so much out of the visitors, Poona became the biggest
tourist place in the whole of India. The people who now have gone to
Poona say it looks a deserted place: hotels are empty, houses are empty,
prices have fallen.</p><p>And you will be surprised to know that the people who were against me
had arranged a Hindu ritual -- a fire ritual, which one hundred brahmins
have to perform for seven days continuously, twenty-four hours of
continuous prayer to God that I should be brought back. And these were
the same people who had even made an attempt on my life!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID THEY PERFORM THIS RITUAL? RECENTLY, OR. ?</p><p>A: Just two years ago.</p><p>Q: HOW DID YOU GET THE FINANCING TO START THE ASHRAM IN POONA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I had so many rich friends all over the country. I don't have a
single cent, and now I have people all over the world who have money and
who have guts to risk that money with a dangerous man like me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU TO GET ADDITIONAL LAND, IS
THAT WHEN YOU MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. They were not allowing for seven years, so that was not the
problem. I had no intention to leave India. If they would not allow us
land outside, we would have gone on purchasing more and more properties
in Poona without changing it into our name. The law in India provides
that if somebody has occupied a house for nine months, you cannot throw
him out, so it does not matter... who cares in whose name the property
is? -- we are the users. So we went on purchasing properties. Still our
people are growing there.</p><p>Since I have not been there, the opposition has died down. In fact
much sympathy has arisen, so our people have purchased four hundred
acres of land near Poona, and they are developing a new commune
there.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID YOU WANT TO LEAVE POONA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. For me it makes no difference: wherever I am, I never go out.
Rajneeshpuram may be in the Soviet Union, or in America or in India. It
does not matter to me, I don't know who is living outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW IS RAJNEESHPURAM DIFFERENT FROM POONA, PHYSICALLY?</p><p>A: In many ways. First, it is 126 square miles of land; the Poona
ashram was only six acres of land. It differs because all the sannyasins
can live together here. In Poona it was difficult, they were living in
separate places. Now they have their own home, and all are living
together, working together, producing, creating. The Rajneeshpuram
commune is no longer dependent on anybody -- we are self-
sufficient.</p><p>Right now five thousand sannyasins are here, but it changes. People
go on coming, living here for three or four months, as much as they can
afford. Each thing is made by sannyasins: the food, the clothes,
everything is created by sannyasins with great love.</p><p>In Poona it was sad -- they were cheated, exploited. They were
falling sick continuously because India is dirty, the water is
polluted.</p><p>Here we have pure water, we have pure air, we don't have neighbors --
it is easy to love your enemies, but it is not easy to love your
neighbors. We are alone here, in our own world, totally independent. In
Poona, everything had to be done so that the old conditioned mind was
not disturbed too much. Here, there is no problem. Even if people want
to go to the lake and have a sunbath naked, nobody is bothered by that.
If people want to dance and sing, nobody is bothered. In Poona it was a
difficult problem: if people wanted to dance, then there were so many
complaints from the neighbors, and soon the police were there, saying
that they are disturbing the neighbors.</p><p>Now, at last, we are not disturbing any neighbors. And those who are
disturbed, they are far away. Let them boil up within themselves. Let
them enjoy... if they enjoy hostility. But they don't have even the guts
to come here and see. They may be just thirty miles away, but they don't
have the guts to come and see. Deep down they are afraid that perhaps we
are right and they are wrong. That is the threat. Anybody who has come
here has gone away with a different attitude, with a new attitude about
the commune.</p><p>Q: YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED THE POONA ASHRAM TO ME AS
HAVING MANY LUSH GARDENS, AND WHEN THIS RANCH WAS FIRST PURCHASED IT WAS
ALMOST WORTHLESS DESERT LAND.</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q:... WHAT DID YOU THINK, OR WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION WHEN YOU FIRST
CAME AND SAW THE LAND HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I did not like it, because I have always liked greenery and this
was a desert, so I was not impressed. I told my people that they have to
change this place into an oasis, and in these four years we have done
much. Just four years more, and it will not be a desert anymore. We will
make it lush green.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ALL OVER? YOU WILL TURN THE WHOLE RANCH INTO AN OASIS?</p><p>A: No. There is no need. Just Rajneeshpuram, the city. An over, I
would like it as it is, as a remembrance; all over I will keep it as it
is, as a remembrance of how it used to be and what we have done to it.
Mountains have also their beauty, naked. The juniper -- that is the only
tree around here -- has its own beauty and strength. We will make many
lakes... we have already made one, one was already there. We will make
many lakes, and we have created a small river just with rain water. We
are growing our food, we are working in the fields, we have</p><p>our own vegetable gardens, our own flower gardens, our own
greenhouses. So whatsoever we want to do we can do.</p><p>And now I can see that it was good to have a desert. It has given us
a challenge, and challenge brings creativity to function. And it is far
more enjoyable that all the trees and all the lakes and all the greenery
have been made by us. It is our creation, it is not second-hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT HAS BEEN SAID TO ME THAT YOU LEFT POONA IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.
IS THIS TRUE?</p><p>A: Certainly true!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE IMPLICATION BEING THAT YOU SNEAKED AWAY, AS OPPOSED TO
ANNOUNCING IT.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME HOW YOU LEFT POONA?</p><p>A: I left in my Rolls Royce, and not in the dead of the night. I left
Poona in the day, in the midday sun, with two Rolls Royces, three
Mercedes Benz. With five cars I left in the middle of the day. I left
BOMBAY at midnight, because the plane leaves at midnight. What could I
do?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHPURAM BECOMING A CITY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO
HANDLE MORE PERMANENT SANNYASIN RESIDENTS THAN THERE ARE NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN A SELF-SUSTAINING WAY, I MEAN; A LARGER VEGETABLE FARM
AND...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU ENVISION RAJNEESHPURAM GROWING AS A CITY? BY HUNDREDS,
OR THOUSANDS, OR...?</p><p>A: Nothing can be said about that. But it is growing, and I don't see
any reason except a third world war to prevent Rajneeshpuram from
growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT YOUR DAY IS LIKE? GETTING BACK TO.…
I'M SERVING READERS WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT...</p><p>NONE OF WHOM, EXCEPT FOR A FEW, HAVE EVER BEEN HERE, AND THEY ARE
CURIOUS ABOUT YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is all over ecstasy. Q: I'M SORRY?</p><p>A: It is all over ecstasy. I enjoy everything. I enjoy my breakfast,
I enjoy my lunch, I enjoy my supper, and I enjoy my sweets before I go
to sleep. Just please don't tell my physicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THE DAY?</p><p>A: I am completely engaged. In the morning I speak to my sannyasins
for two and a half hours. In the night I meet media people as long as
they want; and after the media has left, Sheela has her work -- she is
my secretary -- for one hour, two hours, as much as she needs. A few
things I have absolutely private: three hours in my bathroom, one and a
half hours in the morning, and one and a half hours in the evening.
That's my luxury. Sometime you should come and see my bathroom.</p><p>Q: I'LL ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION ANY TIME!</p><p><br></p><p>A: Good! Because it is almost a temple to me, and my people have
created such a beautiful bathroom because they knew I love big things! I
have a swimming pool only for myself, olympic size. You should see my
garage -- almost one hundred Rolls Royces. And my people have improved
upon them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They have painted them better. They have changed many faults that
were there. Even the president of the Rolls Royce company in America was
here to see, and he remarked that there is no other garage where a Rolls
Royce is treated in this way. Just because I use them, my people take
care of them. They have painted my Rolls Royces in psychedelic
colors.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF I COULD BACK UP FOR A MINUTE.… WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS
FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND WHEN THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TO
OREGON AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED HERE, DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS OR WERE
YOU SURPRISED AT THE KIND OF RECEPTION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM
OREGONIANS, WHO ARE AMERICANS, WHO ARE CITIZENS OF A COUNTRY THAT WAS
FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM?</p><p>A: I was not only surprised, I was utterly disappointed, because I
have always respected America. I had always thought that democracy
really exists here. I have been always against the Soviet Union and its
dictatorial government, but when I came here I found it is another
Soviet Union -- perhaps the dictatorship is more sophisticated, the
democracy only a mask -- because our people have been treated so badly,
and they are continuously harassed for no reason at all. Their ways of
harassment are really ugly, fascist.</p><p>Democracy exists only in the Constitution. Perhaps for Christians
there is democracy and freedom of religion, but not for us. And I want
the whole world to know that there is nothing much to choose between the
Soviet Union and America, only that the Soviet Union is straightforward,
frankly accepting that it is a dictatorship of the proletariat. America
is a hypocrite.</p><p>Q: CAN YOU ENVISION YOURSELF EVER RETURNING TO INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, for the simple reason that that's not my lifestyle. I never
return to anything. What is past is past. I have changed places many
times, in India too, but once I have left a place, I have never visited
it again. So, seeing my pattern of the past, a logical conclusion is
that I'm not going anywhere -- particularly because of this hostility,
this hypocritical democracy I have to fight here. We are fighting in so
many courts, and we will go on fighting up to the Supreme Court. Either
they have to be fair with us and democratic, or we are going to expose
them all over the world as another dictatorship -- not of the
proletariat, but of the super-rich.</p><p>Q: YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF, I THINK IN AN INTERVIEW, AS THE RICH MAN'S
GURU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR ME WHAT THAT MEANS? AND HOW THAT WOULD BE
DIFFERENT FROM, SAY, A POOR MANS GURU? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A STATE OF
MIND, OR A STATE OF THE POCKETBOOK? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT STATE OF MIND
-- THAT THE RICH HAVE A DIFFERENT STATE OF MIND THAN THE POOR -- OR ARE
YOU MERELY TALKING ABOUT ECONOMICS?</p><p>A: I am talking in all the dimensions. A man can be reached in many
ways, and economics is not excluded. He can be reached in music, he can
be reached in poetry, he can be reached in wealth. All need a certain
kind of intelligence to create; and when I say I am a rich man's guru, I
mean I am the Master of all those who are creators in any dimension of
life. Of course, the poor man cannot create,</p><p>he cannot even manage his physical survival. You cannot expect him to
understand Van Gogh or the theory of relativity or Bertrand Russell. And
if he cannot understand Bertrand Russell, he cannot understand me.</p><p>I have doubts whether Bertrand Russell would be able to understand me
or not, most probably not, because he never meditated in his whole, long
life. He lived almost a century, and he went on denying the existence of
God without even bothering to look into himself Not a single moment in a
century-long life did he sit down and look into himself to ask if he is
only a body or there is something more to it. And if the body is just
the outer shell of something which is not material, that means this
whole existence is full of life. Even the soul has to be in a tree, if
the tree is alive.</p><p>To me, life is God. There is no other God than life. And to
experience life, there is no other way than meditation. So, naturally,
it is difficult for the poor people. You cannot hope that Ethiopians
will come to meditate here; nor am I going there to teach them
meditation. Their need is different. I fulfill the needs of those who
are hungry for something higher than bread and butter.</p><p>And you ask me what it means to be a poor man's guru. It means Mother
Teresa, Pope the Polack, these are the people who are the gurus of the
poor, because those poor people can be converted to Christianity very
easily. Just give them a little support economically, financially; give
them schools, hospitals, free food, free milk for their children. That
is enough, but that is not religion. That is simply purchasing people,
making them Christians on financial grounds. They are simply playing a
politics of numbers. They want that poor people should go on existing,
because that is from where they can get Christians.</p><p>In India, I have not seen a single rich man who has converted to
Christianity. I have seen beggars, poor people, hungry people, dying
people, sick people being converted to Christianity, but I have not seen
a painter, a musician, a poet, a wealthy man turning to Christianity. In
fact, exactly the opposite is happening. All the great painters of the
West, all the musicians, all the dancers, all those who can think
intelligently have dropped out of Christianity. With them I can have a
communion -- very easily.</p><p>The pope cannot have a communion with Jean-Paul Sartre, it is
impossible. The pope will look retarded before Jean-Paul Sartre. He will
not be able even to understand what Jean-Paul Sartre is talking about:
anguish, meaninglessness -- these are the poor man's guru. Up to now,
the world was only divided into the poor and the rich. I have made a new
division: the poor man's guru and the rich man's guru.</p><p>Q: A FEW YEARS AGO, YOU WERE QUOTED AS SAYING THERE WAS NO SINGLE
PATH, THERE WAS NO EXCLUSIVE RELIGION. YOU EMBRACED ALL FORMS OF
RELIGION. AND THEN, A FEW YEARS LATER, YOU SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND
WHEN YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT THAT, YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE FULL OF
CONTRADICTIONS.…</p><p>A: I am a man of contradictions, and I am proud of it! Only an idiot
is always consistent. The intelligent person goes on growing, finding
new ground, new spaces. And when I go on finding new groovy spaces,
naturally I have to talk about them. And if they contradict my past, so
what? Past is dead anyway.</p><p>Q: I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE, AND I HAVE SEEN THE DRIVEBYS, AND I THINK
I HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT SANNYASINS ARE EXPERIENCING DURING THE DRIVEBY.
WHAT DO YOU EXPERIENCE INSIDE YOUR CAR WHEN YOU DRIVE PAST YOUR
DISCIPLES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love them. Just to see them is a great nourishment to me. to see
them dance, to see them laugh. Perhaps I start feeling: I am certainly
the Blessed One -- so much love I don't think anybody has received ever.
Jesus had only twelve fools around him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU HAVE DOUBTS THAT YOU ARE THE BLESSED ONE?</p><p>A: Not doubts... I am a perfectly Blessed One. I was just joking a
little bit.</p><p>Q: YOU DON'T GO OUT DRIVING ANYMORE AROUND HERE, IS THAT CORRECT?</p><p>A: Not every day now. When I was not speaking, when I was in silence,
I wanted to see my sannyasins every day... that's why the driveby was
invented. Now I am seeing them in the morning for two and a half hours
every day, so there is no need. But we have four celebrations around the
year. In each celebration -- it will be a seven day celebration -- they
will have driveby also.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DON'T DRIVE AROUND THE HILLS OUTSIDE RAJNEESHPURAM ANY
MORE?</p><p>A: In the beginning I used to, but the county road that connects us
is exactly the road that goes to hell. So I don't go. I dropped the
idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIGN AT THE LAST TURNOFF TO RAJNEESHPURAM
RECENTLY? I SAW IT ON THE WAY IN TODAY: "ABANDON YE ALL HOPE WHO ENTER
HEREIN." HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIGN?</p><p>A: No, because I don't go there, but I have heard about it. It is
right -- because what is the need of hope here? We are eating the cake,
and they are simply hoping for it.</p><p>Q: I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION. IT'S A LITTLE FRIVOLOUS. IN ORDER</p><p>TO GO ON DRIVING, I KNOW YOU HAD TO GET AN OREGON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT THAT WAS LIKE, TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION WITH
THE OREGON TESTER, OR THE MAN WHO GOES WITH YOU AND GIVES YOU THE
DRIVING TEST? I MEAN, WHAT HE WAS LIKE WHEN HE WAS GIVING YOU THE
TEST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There was really no need. The person who examined me could
understand it clearly: I can drive from here to Madras, and I have an
Indian license for driving, and I have an international license for
driving, so he simply thought it was absolutely foolish. I could examine
him! He just went around with me to show that an examination was being
done -- a nice fellow.</p><p>Q: AND ON THAT NOTE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Good. I was happy!</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-14>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 25.]</p><p>Roberta Green</p><p>SANTA ANA REGISTER ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA</p><p>QUESTION: THE 'SANTA ANA REGISTER' IS IN ORANGE COUNTY, WHICH IS
APPROPRIATE, I THINK. I'VE DONE MANY ARTICLES ABOUT RAJNEESHEES; I DID
SOME ABOUT GEETAM ASHRAM, AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL ABOUT UTSAVA IN LAGUNA
BEACH, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET THE CHANCE TO COME HERE! THAT TAKES
CARE OF MY QUESTIONS!</p><p>THEY SAID IT WAS SAFE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS! ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT I'VE READ THAT YOU'VE SAID, AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY IT ON
VIDEOTAPE, IS THAT YOU TELL A FEW JOKES TO WAKE THE WORLD UP. WHEN DID
THE WORLD GO TO SLEEP? AND IS IT WAKING UP?</p><p>ANSWER: It has been always asleep. Only a few individuals in the
whole history of man have been awakened. Their names can be counted on
the ten fingers, not more than that.</p><p>And it was natural. Man has evolved out of the animals. Animals are
in a deep sleep, but they don't know that they are. That is the meaning
of sleep: one is, but one is not aware that one is. No animal is aware
of himself.</p><p>I agree with Charles Darwin on different grounds. His grounds are
ordinary, mundane, and can be criticized, have been criticized. In fact,
he is no longer an accepted scientist about the evolution of humanity.
The majority of scientists have deserted him. But I support him on a
totally different ground. My ground is looking at man's sleep. This is
the only possibility, that he has grown up from the animals -- monkeys,
chimpanzees, whatsoever, whosoever was there in the beginning. Man's
sleep proves it. And only rarely, once in a while, a Gautam Buddha, a
Bodhidharma, a Socrates. Once in a while there has been a man who</p><p>has the guts to come out of sleep.</p><p>It needs tremendous courage to come out of sleep because we have so
much invested in sleep. It is just like a man who is dreaming that he is
living in a</p><p>golden palace, with a great kingdom, with all the luxuries, and you
try to wake him up. He is just a beggar on the street. Only beggars
dream of being emperors; emperors never dream of being emperors. That
will be simply illogical. The beggar has so much investment in his sleep
and his dream that he will resist being awakened in every possible way.
He will get irritated, he will oppose you, "Who are you to interfere in
my life? Can't you even tolerate a man who is having a sweet dream?" And
even if you force him to be awakened, he is going to fall asleep again,
because waking he is only a beggar... asleep he becomes an emperor.</p><p>The investment in psychological sleep is tremendous. That's why all
those people</p><p>-- Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu, Plotinus, Heraclitus have
failed. They did their best; they struggled against the sleep of man,
but still man is asleep, and whatever he is doing proves that he is
asleep.</p><p>The two world wars prove that he is asleep. The coming third world
war can be prevented only if we can awaken enough people so that they
become infectious and go on awakening other people in a chain. And it
has to be done so fast, because there is not much time. Otherwise, the
sleepy people are going to destroy this earth, this life.</p><p>Politicians are asleep. No awakened person can become a politician
for the simple reason that he cannot lie. He cannot give you promises
that he knows can never be fulfilled. No awakened person will be a
politician, because he has no desire for his ego to be fulfilled. There
is no ego any more. Ego exists as a substitute self in sleep; the moment
you are awakened, ego has no function, it is useless. You are there, now
you don't need it.</p><p>And the man who knows himself has no inferiority complex. Unless you
are suffering from some inferiority complex, you will not be involved in
any kind of leadership, political, religious, social. You don't have the
base. The inferiority complex is the cause of everybody becoming
ambitious. If they don't become somebody in the world, in their own eyes
they have failed. They want to prove themselves: "We are here! We have
been here!" They want their names to be recorded in history, although
they know that even the greatest names in history, by and by, go on
slipping from prominence, become footnotes, move into the appendix and
out the door. Naturally, how many people can we go on carrying?</p><p>-- but they want to make their names. That, too, proves something
animal.</p><p>All the animals of the world have an instinct; scientists call it the
territorial imperative. The dog pissing on the tree is simply making his
signature. He is saying, "This tree belongs to me." He won't allow
another dog to come near. Other dogs will smell his urine and will know
that this tree is not free, not available, that somebody possesses it.
There are animals, particularly lions, who will go on urinating on a
vast territory just so that everybody is aware that if they come there,
they will be getting into danger.</p><p>Man also works in the same way. All these nations are nothing but
people pissing and making a boundary: this is America, this is Soviet
Union, this is</p><p>India. You can smell it is a different country, so don't enter
without a visa, without a passport. Otherwise, there is no need for any
nations on the earth. What is the need? Can't we all live as one
humanity? It would be tremendously beautiful and tremendously
beneficial... because if the whole world is one, you cannot create wars.
Unless you find some planets and start creating wars with them, there is
no possibility of war.</p><p>The only way to let war disappear is to make the world one, with a
functional world government, with no political parties in the world,
each individual choosing on his own, nobody propagating, nobody trying
to get more votes. If we can create a functional world government which
only takes care of things like railways, post office, telegraph,
telephone -- things which are essential and should be taken care of by
the whole commune around the earth -- seventy-five percent of all the
nations' income will be freed. It is now being poured out for weapons:
atom bombs, nuclear weapons and other weapons.</p><p>People are dying. In Ethiopia they are dying, thousands a day. In
India they are starving, and soon other countries will follow. This
third world of poor countries is there because of your politicians. A
man who is awake cannot be a politician. He cannot be a religious
leader, either, because these are all ego claims: I am the prophet of
God; I am the messiah; I am somebody special sent from God; you are just
ordinary human creatures, I am divine. This is simply sickness of the
mind. These people are suffering from inferiority complex and covering
it by fictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHO ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am just myself. No prophet, no messiah, no Christ. Just an
ordinary human being... just like you.</p><p>Q: WELL, NOT QUITE!</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's true... not quite! You are still asleep -- but that is not
much of a difference. One day I was also asleep; one day you will be
able to awaken. You can wake up this moment, nobody is preventing it. So
the difference is just meaningless. A person who is capable of being
asleep is capable of being awake.</p><p>Q: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS GOD? A: No.</p><p>Q: WHAT IS WITHIN US? YOU TALK ABOUT TURNING INWARD. WHAT DOES THAT
REALLY MEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: First, let us finish God; otherwise, he will interfere again and
again. God is just a projection of the ego. As ego is false and a
substitute for a true self, God is the</p><p>ego of the whole world -- a substitute self, because our egos cannot
exist without support. They need universal support, and God gives
immense support.</p><p>When I say go inwards... you are not going to find God at all. You
are going to find a pure, silent consciousness, and you are going to
realize immediately that the same consciousness pervades all. I call it
godliness, not God, because this is a quality. Don't give it a
personality, don't confine it into a person. Let it remain free,
flowing. It is more like a fragrance than like a flower. A flower can be
painted, a flower can be photographed; a fragrance can only be
experienced, you cannot photograph it, you cannot paint it. It is a
quality far superior to the personal God. It is an impersonal
consciousness, universal consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DOESN'T THAT SEEM SORT OF BORING?</p><p>A: Boring?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. To an asleep person, it is boring. The person who is asleep
needs colorful dreams, changes -- every night, marriage, divorce, job
change. The asleep person becomes bored very easily for the simple
reason that his joy is derived from something, it is not coming from his
own inner source.</p><p>I have never been bored since I came to know myself. I have been
trying in every possible way. Eating the same food for years, I don't
get bored. Sleeping at the same time, waking at the same time, doing the
same thing round the clock for years, I don't get bored because there is
no comparison with the past, there is no comparison with the future.</p><p>Boredom needs comparison. You have to remember that this rose is
nothing new: you have seen it yesterday, you have seen it the day before
yesterday. You are bored. And slowly your boredom creates a barrier
between you and the rose. You cannot smell it any more, you cannot see
it any more. Although you see it, you cannot see its newness, its
freshness. The rose that you had seen yesterday is not the same rose. It
has the same quality, the same fragrance, but it has its own
individuality.</p><p>When you feel a cosmic consciousness, you are not lost like a dewdrop
in the ocean. For the first time your individuality is revealed to you.
For the first time you know the luminous being that you always have
been; that you will always be immortal, that now there is no death.
There is a tremendous insight into the beauty and the grace of things,
and it goes on becoming bigger and bigger, fresher and fresher. It is
not that it remains the same -- the universal energy is a constant
growth.</p><p>That's why I wanted to finish with God in the first place, because
God cannot grow. Where will he grow? He is perfect. Now perfection
cannot grow. He</p><p>knows all; what more is there for him to know? He is omnipotent,
omniscient, omnipresent... and don't you get bored with God?</p><p>My godliness is imperfect; it is an opening, always bigger and
bigger. It is expanding, and there are no limits to its expansion. And
each moment is a discovery for the awakened man. In small things --
sipping the tea in the morning,the smell of the tea.… The taste of the
tea is so new, it is as new as the sun rising outside the window.</p><p>It depends on how conscious you are to make the world new every
moment. It is already new every moment; nothing is static, everything is
changing, in a flux. The tree that you had left at home, by the time you
go back a few leaves may have died, the wind may have taken them. A few
new leaves may have come up, a few flowers may have fallen to the
ground, a few new buds may have opened. It is only to a sleeping man
that the tree is the same. To the awakened man, it is new every
moment.</p><p>Heraclitus said, "You cannot step in the same river twice." And I say
to you that you cannot step even once in the same river, because while
your feet touch the surface of the river, it is flowing. Your feet go
into the river, and it is flowing. By the time your feet have touched
the bottom, it is not the same river you touched on the surface.</p><p>Heraclitus is wrong. Many people have said Heraclitus is wrong, that
the world is permanent. I say it from a totally different direction --
and I know Heraclitus will have to agree with me, because I am not
contradicting his basic standpoint, I am refining</p><p>When he says you cannot step twice, he is trying to say that
everything is changing, the wife is not the same, the husband is not the
same. If people are awake, I don't think there will be so much despair,
gloom, grumpiness, so many complaints about everything. The husband is
bored because it is the same wife, the same geography he has to explore
every day. The wife is also bored; the moment the husband starts making
an approach, immediately she has a heart attack, a headache, anything
will do, but somehow..."at least one holiday. Just go to sleep silently.
Don't disturb me." And this is the same woman who had been dreaming
about this man one day, writing beautiful poems and letters to him --
and this is the same man.</p><p>What has happened? What went wrong? Why are they thinking to divorce
each other? They have become bored, and they think that the other is
responsible for the boredom. My point is that your sleep is responsible
for all boredom. No divorce is going to help. The other person will bore
you just the same.</p><p>Q: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WAKE SOMEONE UP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It needs people who can shock you. Your sleep is deep; it is no
ordinary sleep, it is spiritual sleep. You need people who can shock you
and break all your shock</p><p>absorbers. Every person has grown buffers around his sleep. Even if a
shock is given, the buffers absorb it. It never reaches to the
person.</p><p>The real function of a religious man is to teach how to break the
buffers, how to come out of the shell of darkness in which you have been
living for many lives. No prayer is going to help. Only a Master can
help you -- and by a Master I mean a craftsman who has broken his own
buffers, who has somehow sneaked out of the shell of sleep. That is the
function of a Master. But all the so-called religious leaders go on
putting more buffers on you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I JUST SPENT TWO WEEKS COVERING BILLY GRAHAM, WHO IS A SOUTHERN
BAPTIST EVANGELIST.</p><p>A: I know him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just worthless, and dangerous to people's spirituality, because
these people like Billy Graham, who are helping people, comforting
people, consoling people, are making their buffers thicker and thicker.
These are not the people who shock you. You need a Gurdjieff, you need a
Krishnamurti, not Billy Graham. Billy Graham is simply a good salesman
amongst sleepers. And, of course, sleepers will be very much impressed.
This man is giving them what they want.</p><p>When you come to a person like Gurdjieff, he is not going to give you
what you want, he is going to give you what really is your need, because
the wanting comes from your sleep, and your need comes from your real
being. So, a man like Gurdjieff will not have gatherings like Billy
Graham. He will shock you so much that you will never come near him
again. Billy Graham is good entertainment, with nothing spiritual in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, RAJNEESHEES LOVE YOU. ARE YOU GIVING THEM WHAT THEY
WANT?</p><p>A: No. NEVER! I am giving them what they need. Q: THEN WHY ARE THEY
STILL HERE?</p><p>A: Because they have started loving the shocks that I give them. Q:
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY ARE AWAKE?</p><p>A: Getting.… Taking time.… Turning this side and that side, pulling
up the blanket, but I am after them! No blanket can help, no tossing and
turning can</p><p>help. I will do everything to force them to jump out of the bed. And
I have all kinds of devices so they cannot sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LIKE WHAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Like my methods of meditation. You have to breathe so heavily for
ten minutes that not only will you start awakening, but somebody else
sitting near by will start wondering what is happening. In the dynamic
meditation, they have to scream for ten minutes. Whatsoever it feels
like: shouting, roaring, screaming. These are methods to break their
buffers.</p><p>I have lived in many cities and finally I decided that I cannot live
in a city. It is impossible, because every day the neighbors were
complaining to the police that they cannot sleep in the morning: "This
man gathers people who scream and jump and dance and sing and do all
kinds of crazy things. And we are tired and we want to sleep. Even on
Sunday morning, these people won't leave you alone. Just at five o'clock
they start. "</p><p>I have 112 methods of hitting you. If one misses, another will do. Q:
DO YOU ONLY HIT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HIT?</p><p>A: Certainly. I never hit anybody who does not want to be hit. That's
why I never go anywhere. You have to come to me, because otherwise that
is against the freedom of the individual. If he wants to sleep, it is
his decision, and he is completely free to sleep. If he wants to hang
around Billy Graham, who am I to create any disturbance and tell him
that he is hanging around an idiot?</p><p>Q: WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE AFRAID OF YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just because of the way I hit and shake and wake you. They don't
want to wake up, they want to go on sleeping. They really want only
consolations, not revolutions in their lives. They want to be consoled,
"Don't be worried, Jesus Christ will take care of you. Just have faith
in Jesus Christ, and that's enough. Don't be worried. Have faith and you
will be saved -- he is the savior."</p><p>This is a consolation. You start feeling you have to do nothing, only
at the most go to the church on Sunday morning and have faith in Jesus
Christ, which costs nothing. Yes, one day it used to cost. That time it
was significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULDN'T JESUS BE PRETTY UPSET WITH THE SCENE THAT YOU ARE
DESCRIBING? I MEAN, HE SAID THINGS LIKE, "TAKE UP YOUR CROSS, " AND
"LOSE YOUR LIFE TO FIND IT, " WHICH ISN'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT.</p><p>A: Jesus is two thousand years old. Don't compare a bullock cart with
a Rolls Royce. They both do the same work, but please don't compare.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SPEAKING OF ROLLS ROYCES, TWO QUESTIONS. ONE IS, WHY ROLLS ROYCES
AND NOT FERRARIS? AND THE OTHER IS, WHAT DOES WAKING UP HAVE TO DO WITH
THE MATERIAL WORLD? I READ ALL THESE WIRE STORIES THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT
THEY ASKED YOU IF YOU'RE THE GURU TO THE RICH. AND THERE ARE ALL THESE
ROLLS ROYCES AND THERE'S ALL THIS MONEY, ALL THIS STUFF... THIS IS A
BEAUTIFUL PLACE, AND IT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T COME FROM NOWHERE. WHAT DOES
WAKING UP HAVE TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD?</p><p>A: That, too, is giving a shock to the whole world. I can manage even
with the oldest model of Ford -- the same model in which God drove Adam
and Eve out of the garden of Eden -- but that will not shock anybody,
not even the Oregonians. Even they have better four-wheelers. All my
efforts are to shock people. My ninety Rolls Royces have shocked
millions of people around the earth. Can you see the joke? And I am
going to make them 365, one for every day. That will give heart attacks
to many people -- but I wonder what it has to do with them. It has
nothing to do with them, but they are certainly shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU CARE?</p><p>A: I care out of my compassion. It comes with the cosmic
consciousness itself. It is a quality of cosmic consciousness; you
cannot separate it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD COMING TO AN END
-- EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND WARS AND THINGS. IS THAT STILL HAPPENING? DO
YOU STILL SEE THAT COMING TO HAPPEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will go on saying yes, it is going to happen, because if it is
emphasized continuously that it is going to happen, it can be prevented
from happening. If the whole world becomes alert that it is coming
close, something has to be done to prevent it.</p><p>Politicians go on saying, "Don't be worried, nothing is going to
happen." It is the same as they were saying before the second world war,
before the first world war: "Don't be worried, we will take care; and
God is with us."</p><p>The third world war can happen only if people are not alerted
beforehand. If people are alerted in every country, in America and
Soviet Russia, then these same people will hang their politicians rather
than have a third world war. This will be far better, when I see the
president of America hanging from the tree, and by his side the Soviet
prime minister and the queen of England.… Just hang all</p><p>these people on one tree, make it a great memorial, and be finished
with the third world war.</p><p>I have been saying those things because they are possible; but if you
say to people that they are only possible, then they think there is
nothing to be worried about, it is only a possibility, far away. People
don't see that far ahead; they don't have that farsightedness. They are
too much occupied in their day-to-day affairs. They have to be hammered
continuously to realize that the war is coming closer, that the
holocaust is coming closer and something has to be done to prevent
it.</p><p>My prediction is not the prediction of an astrologer. I don't mean
that it is bound to happen, that it is destined to happen, no; I am not
an astrologer. My prediction comes from a man who wants that it should
not happen. And the only way is to emphasize that it is going to happen
-- it is almost certain -- unless you wake up.</p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ODDS ARE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Not much. I am here. My people are around the world. We are going
to make a great fuss. And we are not going to pray to God -- that I can
leave to Billy Graham -- God has never helped.</p><p>For five thousand years the wars have been continuing, and in every
war God has been asked to help. And sometimes it is very hilarious: the
Germans were asking the Christian God to help them; the English were
asking the same Christian God to help them, the French were asking the
same Christian God to help them, the Americans were asking the same
Christian God to help them, Mussolini was asking the same Christian God
to help him.</p><p>I have heard a story that after the war ended, one German general was
staying with an English friend. Just at the tea table the talk drifted
towards the second world war. The German said, "I have always wondered
what went wrong. We were strong, we had a rare leader, we had unity, we
had a strong nation. What went wrong?"</p><p>The Englishman said, "Perhaps you forgot to pray to God." The German
said, "No! We were praying to God every day. All our armies were praying
to God every day." The Englishman laughed and said, "Then I know what is
wrong. You must be praying in German, and God understands only English!
Next time, don't do that... pray in English, and then see."</p><p>We are not going to pray. There is nobody to whom prayers can be
addressed. But we can create a great fuss among the masses around the
world. And we are going to, if the moment comes. Right now I am
gathering my people and they are coming in thousands every day. Around
the world I have communes just like this. Even in the Soviet Union I
have my sannyasins. Of course, they have to be underground there, they
have to meet in basements.</p><p>The Soviet government is already persecuting my sannyasins, although
they are not wearing the red clothes, not wearing the mala, so there is
no reason for them to find out. But even if somebody has one of my
books, that's enough; or</p><p>somebody has my picture in his house, that's enough. One person is
caught, and they persecute the person, they harass the person to the
point that he has to give addresses of others, other contacts. But,
strangely enough, the more they are persecuting, the more new young
people are becoming sannyasins in the Soviet Union itself.</p><p>We will create as much disturbance as possible to prevent the third
world war, because it is not only a question of some nation being
victorious and some other nation being defeated. If it was only that, I
would not have cared. It is a question that nobody will be victorious,
nobody will be defeated, and all life will disappear from this beautiful
planet.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TALK TO THE PRESS, AND ALSO TO
START TALKING AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S SOMEHOW THE MOMENT?</p><p>A: Certainly! That is one of the most important reasons I have
started to talk to the press. I want the word to be spread through all
possible media. And I don't belong to the past and past methods; I am a
contemporary man -- perhaps belonging to the twenty-first century. I
will use every way of approach ing people in as many directions as
possible, because we don't have much time. The decisive moment will come
by the end of this century.</p><p>In the coming fifteen years, the nuclear weapons will have piled up
so much that the politicians will be under a great pressure -- what to
do now? Except a nuclear war, they will not be able to see any other
possibility. Already so many nuclear, atomic and other weapons exist on
the earth that they can destroy this earth seven times. They can kill
each person seven times. And the poor people in the world are not Jesus
Christ that they will be resurrected. Once dead, they will remain
dead.</p><p>Even Jesus Christ was never resurrected. It is a fiction. Once a man
dies, he dies. Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, that is true,
because he was brought down from the cross within six hours, and to die
on the Jewish cross in those days a person needed to hang at least
forty-eight hours. Because the blood would ooze slowly out of his hands
and legs, it took twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Jesus was brought
down after six hours... and then he disappeared from the cave. This was
a simple conspiracy between a rich disciple of Jesus' and Pontius
Pilate.</p><p>Jesus escaped from Israel, and died in India, in Kashmir. I have been
to his grave. His grave is there. It is a strange coincidence that Moses
also died in Kashmir, not in Israel. When they found Israel, Moses was
already out of date. It took forty years for him to find a third-rate
place like Israel. In forty years, almost all his contemporaries were
gone -- it was a tedious journey, hungry, thirsty -- only one- third of
the original people remained.</p><p>Meanwhile, children were being born, and by the time he reached
Israel, he could not feel any connection with his own people. The first
generation gap was</p><p>felt by Moses. A new generation had come which had no idea of Egypt,
of their slavery. That all looked like mythology. He found a way out
because one of the tribes of the Jews was lost somewhere on the journey.
It was just an excuse, "Now that we have found the holy land, you settle
and I will go in search of the lost tribe" -- and that tribe had reached
Kashmir.</p><p>Kashmir is completely Jewish, although there are no Jews. They have
all been forced to become Mohammedans, but you can see from their noses
that they are nobody else than Jews. Moses died in Kashmir. He must have
been ancient by the time he reached Kashmir. His grave is there; Jesus'
grave is there. Jesus lived long in India. When he was crucified, he was
only thirty-three, and he died at the very ripe age of 112. That is
inscribed in Hebrew on his grave, but in India nobody knows Hebrew.</p><p>These are the only two graves in which the head of the dead person is
not pointed towards Mecca. The other graves are Mohammedan. When
Mohammedans make a grave, the head has to be pointed in the direction of
Mecca. If the feet are put towards Mecca, it is a great sin. So all the
graves are directed towards Mecca; only these two graves are not.</p><p>And both the graves have Hebrew inscriptions. Of course, Jesus' grave
is not inscribed JESUS CHRIST, because that is a Greek translation of
the Hebrew, JOSHUA, THE MESSIAH. Messiah means Christ, in Greek, and
Joshua got changed to Jesus in Greek. On the grave it is absolutely
clear, but Christians are not interested.</p><p>I talked with prominent Christians -- I talked one time with Stanley
Jones, a world famous Christian theologian -- but they were not ready
even to go there. I said, "On my expense you come with me and I will
show you the grave of Jesus." And it is strange that Christians are
taking no interest in it -- but if it is proved that this is the real
grave of Jesus Christ, then there will be trouble. Their whole Bible
will be upset.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THIS MORNING IN DISCOURSE YOU SAID THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS A SLAVE IS
A SLAVE TO THAT SLAVE. AND I WONDER, WATCHING THE TWO MEN WITH GUNS AND
READING ABOUT THE THREATS ON YOUR LIFE AND THE THREATS ON THIS
COMMUNITY, WHAT PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF HARM ARE
ENSLAVED TO? AND I WONDER IF YOU'RE AFRAID?</p><p>A: I am not afraid; otherwise, I would be carrying the gun. But the
people who love me are concerned, and I don't prevent anybody. I don't
prevent any assassin even. If he comes I will say, "Hi! Do your job the
best you can." I will not prevent him, so why should I prevent my people
if they want guards? Let them have them. Those guns in a nuclear age are
only toys; they mean nothing. Why should I prevent them? They are not
carrying nuclear missiles on each side, just toy guns.</p><p>I respect their love. Whatsoever those people can do they are ready
to do it. It is out of respect for their love that I don't object to
those guns, and I know that those guns mean nothing. In this world a
bomb can just be thrown on this small commune, and you can create an
American Hiroshima. What will those guns do? And it will be good that
America also has one Hiroshima, otherwise you are missing something.
Japan has two, Hiroshima and Nagasaki; you should at least have one. And
my commune is here, available.</p><p>I don't object to their guns. They have not done any harm to anybody
in four years, and they are not going to do any harm to anybody. Perhaps
this is the only place in the whole world where there is no crime, no
fighting, no theft, no rape, no murder, no suicide. We have the police
sitting uselessly. I have my guards, but they must be getting bored with
their guns. I don't think they will have any chance to use them, but my
people are concerned. I respect their love for me, and if they want to
do some small things, let them.</p><p>Q: COULD WE TALK ABOUT SEX? WHAT PLACE DOES IT HAVE IN RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't have any relationship with human beings. Q: THAT'S NOT
WHAT I ASKED, ALTHOUGH.…</p><p>A:... And that is not what I have answered. I know what you have
asked. First, get over your nervousness.</p><p>Q: I THOUGHT IT WAS GONE.</p><p>A: No. It happens to every journalist, so don't be worried. I love
mankind, but the way they are, they need immense changes. Because I
propose those changes, they become hostile. They think I am taking away
very precious things from them. I am taking away only their chains, but
they have been in those chains for centuries. They have already accepted
them as ornaments, so my compassion and my love and my concern only
create hostility in them.</p><p>In the French Revolution it happened that there was in France a
castle, Bastille, where they used to imprison people who were sentenced
to remain in prison till they die. Their hands and legs were chained
with heavy chains, and they were put in dark cells with no light. Even
in the day it was night.</p><p>When the French Revolution happened the revolutionaries thought that
those people should be freed. They went to free them, but those people
fought against the revolutionaries, saying, "We don't want to go out of
the prison. We are comfortable here, and now to get into the world
again, to think of earning your bread again.… We have been here for
forty years and may be living just a few years more. At this stage we
are not in a position to come out. In fact, even the</p><p>sun makes us afraid. We have lived these forty years in darkness.
Have mercy on us. Just leave us where we are."</p><p>But revolutionaries are always fanatic people. They forced them, they
threw them out of the castle and took away their chains. You will not
believe it, but half of those prisoners returned to their cells in the
night and asked the revolutionaries who were holding the castle,
"Please, chain us again. We miss our chains. That weight has become part
of us. We cannot sleep. If we do not feel the chains, we cannot
sleep"</p><p>That is the situation of humanity, so many chains: God, heaven, hell,
Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, communist. All kinds of
chains are there -- political, social, psychological, spiritual -- and I
am speaking against them all. I want to cut them.</p><p>Naturally, they feel offended. They cannot understand me, but I can
understand them. I'm not hostile towards them; they are hostile. I don't
feel badly that they are hostile towards me. The hostility went so far
that efforts were made on my life in India. But still I can understand
their problem, so I will not go to them; I will wait here and spread the
message.</p><p>And I particularly depend on the young generation, the intelligent
people around the world. And they are getting interested in it. I don't
have anybody retarded, average. You can meet my people and you can meet
Billy Graham's people and you can see the difference. Most of these
people have been professors, doctors, engineers; they have degrees,
Ph.D., D.Litt. Almost everybody is at least a university graduate. These
are intelligent people, not gullible. Billy Graham cannot impress a
single sannyasin; and, of course, I cannot impress anybody from Billy
Graham's audience. Anything I say will create hostility, enmity.</p><p>That is the art I have been practicing my whole life, how to
influence people and create enemies. So I have stopped influencing... I
am just here, and if anybody feels thirsty the well is available. If you
don't feel thirsty it is your business, but I'm not preventing you from
drinking from my well. I'm available, but I will not even call you to
come and drink from my well.</p><p>The well is there, open, available, so those who are intelligent are
going to be caught in my net sooner or later. And I want only the
intelligent people, because they are the people who will be able to
prevent what is going to happen to humanity.</p><p>The ordinary masses and the crowds, the cripples and the blind and
the sick who go to Billy Graham for some spiritual miracle, to be
healed, they are not my people. If somebody is sick, we have a hospital.
I don't think there has ever been any miracle in the world, or that
there can ever be. Everything happens according to existential laws. If
sometime you see something like a miracle, you have to do some research
and find how it happened. Mostly it is psychological. There is
psychological blindness.</p><p>Now it is a known fact that if a person does not want to see,
somewhere deep down in his psychology he has come to the conclusion that
he does not want to see. Perhaps he loved a woman who deceived him, and
she was the one for whom he wanted his eyes always to be there. Now he
does not want to see anybody, and a miracle happens: he goes blind.
Nothing is wrong with his physiology; the eye specialist cannot find
anything wrong with his eyes, the eye hospital cannot help him. Billy
Graham can help him.</p><p>But he was not blind, and that is why he has started seeing again. He
was simply psychologically blind. He really needed a great crowd of
believers around him shouting hallelujah, the glory of God, the miracles
of Jesus. This whole atmosphere around him makes him courageous enough
to see again. The credit should simply go to the crowd, but it goes to
Billy Graham. Nothing happens in nature which is against the universal
laws.</p><p>Q: DO THOSE LAWS CHANGE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. The universal laws never change. Everything changes according
to the universal laws, but the universal law itself never changes.</p><p>Q: WHERE DID IT COME FROM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is always here. It does not come from anywhere. Why should it
come from anywhere? The question is absurd. If I say it comes to New
York, you will ask me from where it came in New York. The question is
absurd, because whatsoever answer is given, the question will remain the
same: from where did it come, from where God came? Nobody asks such a
simple question: from where God came? From New York? New Jersey? I have
come from New Jersey, but from where God came?</p><p>Universal law is to me exactly what God is to the believer, to the
faithful. But calling it universal law makes a tremendous difference.
You cannot worship a law, you cannot pray to a law; the law has no ears,
no eyes. The law goes on functioning the way it has always functioned.
It won't change for any prayer.</p><p>All prayers are simply asking that you should be treated as an
exception. Somebody is praying to God, "I am blind, please give me
eyes." In the first place he is distrusting God... because God made him
blind. He wants to change God's mind: "Please give my eyes back"and he
is ready to bribe God, "I will believe in you, I will worship you. I
will go every Sunday to the church. I will donate to the church, to the
congregation." These are all bribes: "Give me my eyes back."</p><p>These simple people -- most of them simpletons -- who gather around
Billy Graham and people like him can be easily exploited. All the
religious leaders of the world have been doing that for centuries in the
name of God. All the religions... not only Christianity.</p><p>My religion is more a science than a religion. If somebody is sick,
he should go to the hospital. We have a beautiful hospital here. If
somebody needs education, he should go to the university. We have our
own university here. If somebody is feeling anxiety, anguish, tension,
nervousness, he should go to the meditation classes. If somebody is
having some problems about relationships -- wife and husband and
children and friends -- we have therapy groups for him. For every need
we have a scientific process.</p><p>But a miracle is not possible here... because I don't want to exploit
gullible people. And what is the point? The world is on the threshold of
committing global suicide, and somebody makes a small miracle, gives
some solace to one human being, when the whole of humanity is on the
brink. It is stupid. These people should think on a larger scale.</p><p>I am absolutely concerned because I see what is going to happen if
humanity remains the way it is. But the problem is that if people are
not going to listen to me, then it is their business. As far as I am
concerned, my work is finished. If this earth simply dies out, it makes
no difference to me. I am making an effort with my people that whether
the third world war happens or not, you get enlightened! Be awake! --
because this earth may not be able to survive after this century. Only
fifteen years are left.</p><p>It is a great device, too. When you are challenged with global death
and the gap is only fifteen years, you have to think about yourself. For
the first time, you cannot go on living the same old way, doing the same
old stupid things. Something essential that can bring a transformation
to your being before the world comes to an end becomes significant. So
if my people are awakened, I don't care. If those people don't
understand, let them have the third world war. Let them be satisfied to
their hearts' content.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK THINGS LIKE BIOENGINEERING WOULD PRODUCE PEOPLE THAT
WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO WANT TO BE AWAKE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I believe in bioengineering. I want science to create a better man
in every way, but the problem is that all the governments are forcing
the scientists to create more and more destructive weapons. They are
forcing them into the service of death.</p><p>I would like all the scientists to be in the service of life. Then
bioengineering certainly can create far superior men, healthier, more
talented. In fact, we can fill the whole earth with geniuses; there is
no reason why not. We have all the basic things in our hands. We can
make man live at least three hundred years very easily without getting
old, without having cancer, without having AIDS. This is all that your
old past has given as a heritage.</p><p>We can have people we need: we need more Albert Einsteins, we need
more Picassos, we need more van Goghs, and bioengineering can make it
available. All kinds of artists, scientists, geniuses, mystics,
philosophers, scientists -- we can fill</p><p>the whole earth with such intelligence and glory that people like
Billy Graham will have to commit suicide. Nobody will go and shout
around them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORLD POPULATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. I am very much concerned about the world population,
because if somehow we can postpone the nuclear war, the world population
is going to kill humanity. It is growing with such a speed that unless
science is diverted towards human needs, it is very difficult not to
have many Ethiopias. And it is a sad thing that all around you there are
people dying and you cannot do anything, you feel almost helpless.</p><p>Everything can be done, but all science is geared towards death. Who
cares about Ethiopia or India? Who bothers? Their whole concern is how
to be more powerful than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's
scientists' whole problem is how to be more powerful than America. And
small, stupid nations also are lined up either behind America or behind
Russia. There are a few fools like India, too, who think that by
remaining unaligned, they will be in a better position and can have the
friendship of both sides. They are wrong. They don't understand the ABC
of politics. Unaligned, they are enemies of both parties, not friends.
Nobody can trust them, and nobody can help them.</p><p>The world is almost cut into two parts, and the population is growing
in the poor countries more because the poor man has no other
entertainment than sex. The rich man has many other things. He can
afford many other entertainments. He can listen to music, he can enjoy
Mozart, he can see a great dancer, he can go to the theater, he can have
the best wine available. He has all the beautiful books to read, all the
beautiful statues to collect.</p><p>But the poor man has nothing other than sex as his entertainment. So
he goes on producing, and the religious leaders help him to go on
producing, because they want more numbers.</p><p>Q: DO YOU ADVOCATE ENFORCED BIRTH CONTROL OR STERILIZATION?</p><p>A: Certainly. Absolute birth control for twenty years... because it
is not a question of small importance. If for twenty years there is
absolute birth control, it will give two things to humanity. One, the
population will start disappearing. I want the world to come to
one-fourth of its population; only then can it be a beautiful garden of
life. Second, if people become accustomed to birth control for twenty
years, sex will not remain a serious problem. After the pill, sex has no
significance at all -- it is just fun. It has nothing profane about it
and nothing sacred about it. It is just a biological game. And if two
persons feel like playing tennis, let them play.</p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT DISEASES LIKE AIDS?</p><p>A: They are also contributions of your religions, because your
religions first forced celibacy on monks and nuns and people. Now,
celibacy is absolutely against the laws of biology, against your
body.</p><p>Nobody has ever been celibate, unless he was impotent, and nobody can
ever be celibate. He can pretend he is celibate, but from the back door
he will find all kinds of perversions. Homosexuality was born in the
monastery. That is why I say it is a religious contribution. Monks
living in separation from women, nuns living in separation from men --
what do you expect? Those monks are going to start homosexuality.</p><p>It is now a well-recognized fact that animals in the wild never
become homosexuals, but in zoos they do. It is very revealing. In the
zoos, if there are no females the animals become homosexuals. And your
monasteries are nothing but zoos. They converted men into homosexuals,
women into lesbians.</p><p>AIDs is the ultimate outcome of homosexuality, and the pope should
take responsibility for it. Mother Teresa should take responsibility for
it, the shankaracharya should take responsibility for it, Ayatollah
Khomeini should take the responsibility for it. These are the
people.</p><p>My approach is: Stop this nonsense of celibacy! Let your monks also
have fun with their biology -- it is a gift of nature, beautiful. Let
your nuns also enjoy their bodies. Why are you making them dead before
they are dead?</p><p>If I am listened to, I will make nunneries and monasteries mixed, and
I will take away all barriers which prevent people from taking sex just
as fun. It is not a sin. It is not something to be repressed. That is as
stupid as somebody repressing urination. I wonder why there has not been
some religion preaching celibacy as far as pissing is concerned? -- and
believe me, there will be people who will follow that ideology also. Of
course, they will have to piss somewhere, hiding, but before the world
they will be celibate.</p><p>This AIDS is certainly one of the major problems, just as much as a
third world war. Unless homosexuality and lesbianism disappear
completely, we cannot prevent it from spreading. So heterosexuality
should be preached from every pulpit; it should be rewarded, praised,
and the people who do not follow heterosexuality should be put under
treatment. They are psychologically sick.</p><p>If we want AIDS to disappear, then homosexuality and lesbianism have
to disappear. Otherwise, there is no way. Medical science has not been
able to figure out any medical cure for it. It is a sure killer. Once
you have it, you can live at the most two years more -- that is at the
most. More probably you will live not more than six months; and it is
good if you die sooner, because the longer you live, the more you will
spread it.</p><p>Now the rich people who have AIDS are hiding it. Only the poor people
become exposed to the public. The rich people have their private
physicians; they can manage that the physician keep his mouth shut. They
don't want their families to</p><p>know that they have AIDS. They don't want anybody to think that they
have AIDS.</p><p>I know senators in America who have AIDS. I know senators who are
homosexuals. But the trouble is, these people are in power; the doctor
cannot say anything, and they go on and on spreading it. There have been
great artists, painters, poets who were homosexuals. We should look to
stop every homosexual from having any further contact with any man or
woman. If we cannot stop them.…</p><p>We have found two persons having AIDS in our commune. We immediately
put them into isolation far away in the mountains with everything
comfortable provided for them. All that we can manage, we give to them;
but they should not mix with the other people of the commune, because
AIDS can be caught not only by sexual intercourse, it can be caught even
by kissing.</p><p>Kissing should be completely prohibited all over the world. Of
course, people will feel a little awkward, they will need some
substitute. My substitute is that lovers should start changing from
kissing to rubbing their noses together. And enjoy it... what else can
be done? There are aboriginal tribes where this already happens. They
rub their noses, they don't kiss. They are far more scientific. Kissing
is not hygienic at all; rubbing noses is perfectly hygienic.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COLD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is not much of a problem. A cold is such a small problem that
even if you catch it, nothing is wrong in it. It lasts for seven days if
you don't take any medicine; if you take medicine it lasts one week --
so what is the problem in it?</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-15>The Last Testament, Vol 1

YOU DON'T KNOW IT, IT'S A LIBERAL, SERIOUS -- AS OPPOSED TO TABLOID --
DAILY NEWSPAPER. AND I ALSO DO WORK FOR A SIMILAR PAPER IN AUSTRALIA,
THE MELBOURNE AGE, AND A SIMILAR PAPER IN CANADA CALLED THE GLOBAL MAIL
IN TORONTO. I'VE BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE, THREE YEARS AGO, AND I'M
ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE DIFFERENCE I FIND TODAY. ASTONISHING,
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING! -- SO MUCH SO THAT I COULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE ANY
LANDMARKS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS SO DIFFERENT. AND YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
HERE ALL THIS TIME. DOES IT GIVE YOU A LOT OF JOY TO SEE THE PLACE
FLOWERING? OR DON'T YOU INTEREST YOURSELF A LOT IN THAT?</p><p>ANSWER: I am absolutely interested. This place has to become one of
the most beautiful places on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK IT WILL? YOU HAVE YOUR TROUBLES, EH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No troubles.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WITH THE NEIGHBORS...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE, I READ IN YOUR PAPER HERE THAT YOU ONLY
GAVE A ONE-WORD ANSWER WHEN YOU WERE ASKED IF YOU AND THE NEIGHBORS
WOULD EVER COEXIST PEACEFULLY. YOU SAID: "NEVER." THAT'S A LONG
TIME.</p><p>A: That's true. In the first place, we don't have any neighbors here.
In these 126 square miles, we are alone -- an island in itself. In the
second place, I don't believe in any compromise. If they are right, we
will mix with them, we will drop our own philosophy of life. And if we
are right, then they have to drop their prejudices. But I don't believe
in coexistence; I believe in existence. Either we, or they.…</p><p>Coexistence is a political word, and coexistence is simply a cold
war. Just to avoid, postpone real war, politicians go on talking about
coexistence. If I love you, we don't coexist, we exist together. Only
enemies coexist. I don't have any enemies. If they are hostile, that is
their problem. We are not hostile towards anybody.</p><p>Q: I SEE YOU USE THE WORD COEXISTENCE. IT HAS BECOME POLITICAL,
INDEED, BUT YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU COEXIST IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE, SO YOU TOLERATE IT; AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU WOULD RATHER ENJOY LIVING WITH THESE PEOPLE. DO I INTERPRET YOU
CORRECTLY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Tolerance is an ugly word. To tolerate means you have already
humiliated the other person, you are already higher, holier, more
understanding. The people who talk about tolerance are the most
intolerant people. I never tolerate; either I accept, or I simply forget
all about the person. Why should I tolerate? He has the right to be
himself. I have the right to be myself. There is no need for any
tolerance.</p><p>And they are hostile, we are not hostile. So we enjoy their
hostility; that is the only entertainment in this desert.</p><p>Q: BUT IT'S NO LONGER A DESERT, AS WE HAVE SEEN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will change it into an oasis -- we are changing.</p><p>Q: BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD MISUNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'VE SAID ABOUT TOLERANCE, WHO HAVEN'T THE BENEFIT OF SITTING HERE AND
THINKING IT OVER, AND DISCUSSING IT AND EXPLORING THE IDEA? THEY SEE IT,
IF YOU LIKE, IN PRINT, AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ALL THEIR LIVES, IN
THIS COUNTRY AT LEAST -- IT SEEMS TO ME -- IN DEMOCRACIES, THAT
TOLERANCE IS A GOOD THING, THAT ONE SHOULD TOLERATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THE ALTERNATIVE IS IN FACT HOSTILITY, POSSIBLY LEADING TO VIOLENCE.</p><p>A: No, that is not the only alternative. They are wrong. Just listen
to the sound of the word tolerance: there is hostility in it. Already
you have accepted that there is</p><p>no possibility of friendship, there is no possibility of being
together lovingly. Tolerance simply means somehow to live and let them
live. It is not a beautiful word, it is certainly ugly. There is no need
for tolerance if there is no hostility. It is simply to cover up
hostility.</p><p>We don't tolerate anybody because we are not hostile in the first
place. For example, Jesus says, "Love your enemies," but that means
first you have to create enemies; otherwise, how are you going to love
enemies?</p><p>Q: THERE ARE PEOPLE, THOUGH, IN THE WORLD, THAT WE'VE NEVER MET AND
PROBABLY NEVER WILL MEET WHO JUST START OUT LIFE PURSUING COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT GOALS WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE, A DIFFERENT SET OF
VALUES FROM OURSELVES. AND WHO'S TO SAY WHICH IS THE BETTER SET OF
VALUES? WHEN YOU SAY, "LIVE AND LET LIVE," THAT ALSO, DOES IT NOT, MEANS
TOLERANCE, AND THEREFORE, IN ORDER FOR THESE TWO IDEAS TO LIVE AND LET
LIVE WITH EACH OTHER, YOU HAVE TO ADOPT THIS UGLY WORD TOLERANCE AND
TOLERATE EACH OTHER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I accept their right to be themselves, I am not tolerating; I
will criticize them if I feel it is wrong. It is out of compassion and
love that I will criticize them because I am concerned about them.
Tolerance simply means go to hell -- we aren't bothered.</p><p>There are different sets of values, different ideologies, and I love
the freedom for myself, and for them. They may be against me, that does
not make any difference. I will fight for their freedom too, just the
way I will fight for my freedom. But I will not tolerate. I will
criticize them.</p><p>Either someday they have to accept me, or someday I have to accept
them. Tolerance means that we have decided that now there is no
possibility of any bridge, so what to do? Just let them be, and you be.
I am not.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO THAT'S YOUR USE OF THE WORD never, THEN, BECAUSE YOU MEAN
INFINITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Infinity? -- to the very end of infinity, I will not tolerate
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I SEE. SURE. WHEN YOU MENTIONED DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES -- AGAIN
REFERRING TO SOME OF THE ANSWERS YOU GAVE -- YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T
REALLY... I DON'T THINK YOU SAID, "BELIEVE, " THAT YOU DIDN'T APPROVE...
DON'T GET INSTITUTIONALIZED. YOU SAY YOU FIGHT THAT. AND DON'T BECOME AN
ORGANIZATION, REMAIN AN ORGANISM. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T REALLY
APPROVE OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RELIGION. I READ THAT AND THEN I LOOK AT
THE SIGN ON MY HOTEL WALL -- YOUR HOTEL HERE -- AND IT SAYS</p><p>"RAJNEESHISM." I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT -- AGAIN IT'S SEMANTICS,
PERHAPS -- BUT ism WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST A STRUCTURE, AN IDEOLOGY WHICH
WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST ALSO AN ORGANIZATION. SO THAT IF YOU HAVE
RAJNEESHISM, YOU'RE BOUND TO BECOME ORGANIZED.</p><p>A: That is simply the poverty of language. There is no other word to
replace ism. It is just out of necessity that my people have used that
word; otherwise, there is no ism here, no organization here. We are
living in an organic unity. But it is always a problem with language:
language is old, language is coming from thousands of years, and you
have to use that language.</p><p>An ism needs a certain dogma; we have none. An ism needs a certain
discipline; we have none. An ism needs a fanatic approach; we do not
have any fanaticism. So it is just a necessary evil that we have to use
the word ism. If you can suggest another word, we can change it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, RAJNEESHISM HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A CULT. DO YOU DISAGREE
WITH THAT?</p><p>A: Absolutely. Q: YOU DO?</p><p>A: Yes</p><p>Q: WHY WOULD YOU DISAGREE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because we are not a cult. Christianity is a cult, Mohammedanism
is a cult, Hinduism is a cult. You have to understand my idea about the
cult: When the Master is alive, it is religion; when the Master is dead,
then it is only a corpse. And that corpse becomes the cult.</p><p>With Jesus, Christianity was a religion. Jesus gone, now it is just a
dead weight over humanity. For two thousand years we have been carrying
a corpse.</p><p>I am still alive, that's why I say this is religion, not a cult. And
I tell my people: the moment I am gone, please disperse. Don't keep any
church behind me. We don't want any popes, and we don't want any
Vatican, and we don't want any dead thing to be carried by the coming
generations.</p><p>Q: I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING, TO BE QUITE HONEST. I DON'T SEE YOUR
ADHERENTS HERE, YOUR DISCIPLES, FOLLOWERS, FELLOWS IN YOUR COMMUNITY --
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THEM -- I CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM JUST
DISPERSING LIKE THAT, SORT OF THE DAY AFTER.…</p><p>A: That's up to them. I cannot force them, I can simply say. I never
force anything.</p><p>Q: SO YOUR FINAL WISHES WILL BE DISOBEYED, THEN...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, if they want to disobey me, they are absolutely free. That's
the difference. I am not a prophet, or a messiah, or a messenger of God.
My word is not the authority. They have to think over it and decide on
their own -- and take the responsibility. But nobody can throw the
responsibility on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, YOU'RE ON THE RECORD! WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NO ORGANIZATION
AND DISCIPLINE, I MUST SAY, LOOKING AROUND COMING BACK THREE YEARS
LATER, I SEE PEOPLE -- I THOUGHT THEY WERE CHAUFFEURS, EVERYONE WEARING
THESE SORT OF PLUMCOLORED PEAKED CAPS. THEY APPEARED TO BE UNIFORMS, IN
FACT, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO APPEAR -- I DON'T MEAN JUST THE CHOICE OF
THE COLORS, BUT ACTUALLY WEARING IDENTICAL CLOTHES -- I MEAN THIS WOULD
STRIKE ME INSTANTLY AS ORGANIZATION OF A QUITE EXTREME KIND.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is not. I have given these red clothes to my people so that I
can recognize them and the whole world can recognize them. This is their
identity card, all over the body, so there is no need to pull it out of
the pocket and show to people who you are. But it is not an
organization, and I don't think that there is any spirituality in the
color red. You can see me: I hate the color red!</p><p>Q: (INDICATING HIS FEET) THESE SOCKS WERE GIVEN TO ME!</p><p><br></p><p>A: I hate them! I have put my people in red because that is the only
color I will not use.</p><p>Q: I TAKE THE POINT, BUT I MEANT NOT REALLY THE CHOICE OF A CERTAIN
COLOR -- FAIR ENOUGH, OR VARIATIONS ON IT -- NO, THESE PEOPLE THAT I SAW
WERE WEARING IDENTICAL CLOTHES. THEY WERE CUT THE SAME WAY, THE SAME
SHIRTS. THEY MATCHED, IN OTHER WORDS, IDENTICAL... LIKE AN ARMY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: If they love to have identical clothes, it is perfectly okay. Q:
DO YOU THINK THEY DO? HAVE YOU ASKED THEM?</p><p>A: I have never asked. That is their business. And if you look
closely, they are using different shades of red. That is up to them what
they do. And they are using different kinds of clothes, not similar. Yet
there are a few uniformed people that belong to the police department of
Oregon. They want them to be in a certain uniform, so we have to put
them in a uniform. But they belong to the police force of Oregon; you
must have seen their caps and everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THEY'RE IN RED.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Here they have to be red.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEN THE POLICE DON'T MIND IF THEY WEAR RED?</p><p>A: Here they have to be red. Even if the governor wants to be the
governor of Rajneeshpuram, he will have to be in red. This is just to
shock the people around the world. And it has proved of great
significance.</p><p>For example, thousands of people have come to me in all these thirty
years. Those who became sannyasins remain somehow related with me. Even
if after thirty years they come, I recognize them, I remember them; and
they also feel a certain connection with me. Others had also come, had
loved me, but never became sannyasins. They are lost in the big world. I
cannot recognize them, and I don't think there is any communion existing
between me and them. This has been immensely helpful. I know where my
people are and I know whether they are increasing or decreasing. I know
what they are doing, and I know that I can suggest to them -- I never
order, I can advise -- to take it or not to take it is their business. I
am happy both ways.</p><p>And, secondly, my red people around the world have shocked everybody.
That is of great importance. The moment you shock somebody, he starts
thinking about you, he starts inquiring about you. He becomes curious
what is the matter. He starts reading my books. So many people have come
here and become sannyasins and told me that the first experience was of
a shock.</p><p>But that shock led them to inquire, to read, and finally they ended
up here. So this has been of tremendous significance, useful. And it has
made my people also strong because moving in red clothes in society you
immediately become the focus, the center -- you need some guts to face
all kinds of hostility. It creates something like steel in you. My
people have been expelled from universities as professors, from schools
as teachers, from businesses, simply because they were wearing red
clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S KIND OF A HARSH PENALTY FOR WEARING RED CLOTHES.</p><p><br></p><p>A: But a person who is ready to renounce the job, a good salary in
the university, just to be himself, becomes stronger. I don't want my
people to be ignored.</p><p>Hostility is perfectly okay. Hate I accept, opposition I welcome.
Even if they start shooting my people, there is no problem. But I would
never like my people to be ignored.</p><p>Q: I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH. TALKING
ABOUT NOT WEARING RED, IT WOULD BE TRUE, OF COURSE, WOULDN'T IT, THAT BY
YOUR NOT WEARING RED, EVERYBODY LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON NOT WEARING RED? AND YOU DID SAY THAT YOU'RE THE GREAT SHOWMAN,
AND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE SHOWMANSHIP, WOULD IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: VERY GOOD! AND YOUR ROBES, THEY ARE ALSO PART OF THE
SHOWMANSHIP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Part -- everything is part of my showmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU DESIGN THEM YOURSELF OR DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My people design everything for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OH, IT'S NOT YOUR CREATION, THEN? I THOUGHT YOU CHOSE THEM
YOURSELF.</p><p>A: No. No need, because I have so many intelligent people from every
profession. We have the best legal experts, we have the best professors,
scientists, carpenters, seamstresses, tailors, we have every kind of
people. Our commune is absolutely self-sufficient. So I have my
seamstresses who design, and they are doing so well that I need not
interfere. I love whatsoever they are doing.</p><p>I have my own jewelers -- you just look at my watch! Q: I SAW, YES.
I'VE EVEN READ ABOUT IT.</p><p>A: My own people made my watch. Q: OH, REALLY?</p><p>A: And these are real stones, remember. They are not diamonds, they
are real stones!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: GLASS, CUT GLASS?</p><p>A: But idiots think it is a fake watch: it is real stones, authentic
stones. They are fools, they think it is diamonds. Then they start
thinking it is a fake watch. It is not a fake watch, it is as authentic,
existential, as any diamond can be.</p><p>Q: DOES IT TELL THE TIME AS WELL THEN?</p><p>A: The best! My people don't do anything less than the best!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND YOU WEAR SILK. IS THAT YOUR PREFERENCE? I THINK WHEN I WAS
HERE LAST, YOU WERE WEARING MORE WOVEN, SORT OF NATURAL -- LOOKING
FABRIC.</p><p>A: My people were doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU GONE UP IN THE WORLD, TO SILK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My people were weaving those clothes. I liked them, but then my
physicians were not ready for me to use even synthetic wool, because I
am allergic.</p><p>Q: OH, SURE. I KNOW THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: So I had to drop those beautiful dresses, and I had to move to
other clothes. So this is my physicians' change.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ROTTEN OLD SILK.</p><p>A: Yes. Whenever we change, we go higher.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND I ALSO READ THAT YOUR CARS -- YOU DON'T OWN THESE, OF COURSE;
THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HERE, IN FACT; AND THAT... SO REALLY, YOU DON'T OWN
ANYTHING.</p><p>A: I don't have anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT STRIKES ME THAT IT'S COSTING YOUR FOLLOWERS A FORTUNE TO KEEP
YOU IN POVERTY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is true, but they enjoy it and they love it. If I refuse it,
they will have heart attacks!</p><p>Q: I WAS WONDERING -- ALL THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE
MEDIA ABOUT YOU AND THIS PLACE AND SORT OF AGONIZED APPRAISALS OF THE
SPIRITUALITY AND THE RELIGION AND ITS</p><p>CONTENT, AND HOW RELIGIOUS IT IS OR IS NOT... AND YOU SAY, WELL,
YOU'RE A SHOWMAN. IT STRUCK ME THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE OUGHT TO TAKE YOU AT
YOUR WORD.</p><p>A: Every religious Master has been a showman, and I have defeated
them all.</p><p>Q: BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN? WHY DO ALL THE
RELIGIOUS MASTERS HAVE TO BE SHOWMEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It helps their work. It attracts people to them, and those who
come close, they know that the showmanship is just on the outside.
Inside there is immense work to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IMMENSE WORK? WOULD YOU LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THAT? WOULD YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME THE IMMENSE WORK... YOU DON'T MEAN IN A PRACTICAL WAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That means meditation. That they have to become more conscious,
more alert, and finally they have to come to a point where their
unconsciousness becomes completely conscious.</p><p>Sigmund Freud divides consciousness into three layers: consciousness,
subconsciousness, unconsciousness. Meditation moves in the same way,
from conscious to subconscious: the conscious overwhelms the
subconscious and finally it overwhelms the unconscious.</p><p>If Sigmund Freud was to look into one of my sannyasins, he would be
surprised.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EVEN HE, EH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. Because there is no division, there is only single
consciousness. There is no shadow, no darkness around. So that is the
inner work -- and showmanship certainly helps. The other religious
leaders never said they were showmen. They had no guts to say the truth.
Don't you think Jesus was a showman?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OH, YEAH. MIRACLES, THAT'S PRETTY.…</p><p>A: Yes, miracles and walking on water, and bringing dead back to life
and proclaiming himself the only begotten son of God. I don't do any
such stupid things. But all religious leaders of the world have been
showmen in different ways. The founder of Jainism, Mahavira, remained
naked. Now, that is great showmanship, without clothes... you cannot
think that he is a showman, but what is the point of being naked? He
never used any razors, blades. Every year</p><p>he would pull out his hair, and thousands of people would gather
there, tears in their eyes because their leader is pulling out his hair.
Every year it was a great congregation of his followers. And what was he
doing? Because he said that he would not use any mechanism -- even a
razor is technology -- he made great showmanship out of pulling his own
hairs. And this needs only a little practice, nothing much; once you
have learned it, you can do it.</p><p>I am the first religious man who is telling you exactly what is the
case. I am exposing myself totally, I am not keeping any secret, no
private life. All your religious leaders were somehow cheating,
exploiting, deceiving.</p><p>Q: I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE. I PERSONALLY AM AN ATHEIST, SO THIS IS
MUSIC TO MY EARS. BUT THEN, YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE WHO IS
NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I BELIEVE YOU, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE VALIDITY OF THE
CLAIM?</p><p>A: For example, no religious leader will accept that he is not
celibate. All religions require celibacy, and celibacy is impossible. It
is scientifically impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE, IS IT, BECAUSE... I MEAN THE ORIGINAL
MORMONS WERE POLYGAMOUS, WEREN'T THEY? AND SO THEY MADE A VIRTUE, THE
MEN AT LEAST, OUT OF MANY WIVES -- AND MUCH SEX, I PRESUME. SO NOT ALL
RELIGIONS -- I MEAN MANY, BUT NOT QUITE ALL, SURELY...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There have been a few religions who made that, too, a virtue, and
that was for the same purpose. For example, Mohammed had nine wives. Now
that too is showmanship. He allows Mohammedans to have only four. Only
the prophet can have nine, he keeps himself special. So what other
religions were doing with celibacy, he was doing with the number of
women. The basic thing is the same: that he is special, higher, holier
than thou.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU'RE SPECIAL TOO, AREN'T YOU? A: No.</p><p>Q: I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN OR WOMAN HERE WHO ENTERS A BUILDING ON
A PATH STREWN WITH ROSE LEAVES. I THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIRLY SPECIAL.</p><p>A: That is their joy. I am not special. I have not asked them. If
they don't put the flowers, I will never inquire what happened to the
flowers. If they don't dance, I will not inquire what happened to the
dancers. I can dance alone. Just I need the camera.…</p><p>Q: SHOWMANSHIP, YES! I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT
SPECIAL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I am not.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO DOESN'T WEAR RED, OR A SHADE OF
RED.…</p><p>A: Because I am not a sannyasin. I am nobody's follower.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, BUT IN THIS CONTEXT, THAT'S ANOTHER SPECIAL THING ISN'T
IT?</p><p>A: No, it is not. You are here also.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TWO OF US! YES, WELL INDEED I AM SPECIAL FOR SOME OF THOSE SAME
REASONS -- BECAUSE I AM NOT A SANNYASIN, I'M NOT DRESSED IN RED, IN
WORKING.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, you are not special. Every day journalists are here, you are
not special. You are a guest only for one day or two days; I am a guest
for a little longer time; that is the only difference. I can leave this
place any moment. I don't even live in Rajneeshpuram, in the city. I
live outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN WASCO COUNTY, EH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In Wasco County.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SURE, BUT I MEAN AS I SAY, YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY SEEK BEING
SPECIAL, BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT'S THE CASE, ISN'T IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN DENY THAT, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN
JUST AN EYEWITNESS WOULD LOOK AT THE CROWD AND SAY, "HE'S SPECIAL, HE'S
WEARING BLUE."</p><p>A: Anybody will get that idea that I am special. But I myself am
saying I am not. I am just a guest here, and if they enjoy my being
here, I can remain here. I don't have any belongings, I haven't had
anything for almost thirty years, no bank balance, not a single cent: I
don't have even pockets in my dress. Even if I have to leave this place,
somebody will have to arrange a ticket for me because I don't have
anything. I think, I hope, the American government will do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I AM REMINDED OF ANOTHER CLASS OF PEOPLE, VERY SELECT AND SMALL
CLASS OF PEOPLE, WHO DON'T CARRY MONEY, LIKE YOURSELF, AND THAT'S
ROYALTY. THE QUEEN NEVER CARRIES MONEY, AND THAT IS A SORT OF MARK OF
BEING SPECIAL, BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER, WHICH
ELEVATES HER IN IMPORTANCE, DOESN'T IT?</p><p>-- SO IT MAKES HER SPECIAL. SHE'S A GREAT SHOW WOMAN AS WELL.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They have to do it for her. They have to do it for her, and she
knows she is special and she has never said that she is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY DON'T HAVE TO, DO THEY? I DON'T KNOW; I MEAN, I'VE NEVER GONE
INTO IT BUT THEY WISH TO DO SO, PRESUMABLY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: She is special. She belongs to the royal family, she has the
special blood that is only stupidity -- and everything that she gets is
ordered. If it is not given to her there will be problems immediately.
For me there is no question of ordering anybody. I am not of royal
blood, because I don't think that any blood is royal; and she must be
special, otherwise who would choose such an ugly woman as a queen?</p><p>Q: OH, ABSOLUTELY! I KNOW, SHOCKING, SHOCKING, NATIONAL DISGRACE. A
NATIONAL DISGRACE -- HER SON AS WELL, AWFUL, ISN'T</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, he is retarded.</p><p>Q: THOROUGHLY, YEAH; WELL HE IS AN UPPER CLASS ENGLISHMAN, SO HE MUST
BE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: And that retarded son soon will become your king.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: L KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S A SHOCKING THOUGHT. THERE'S HOPE YET; THERE
COULD BE A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, BUT PROBABLY NOT LIKELY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: In England, you think, a communist revolution...?</p><p>Q: NO, I'M AFRAID NOT. WELL KARL MARX THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE,
ACTUALLY. HE THOUGHT GERMANY AND BRITAIN WOULD BE THE PLACES WHERE THERE
WOULD BE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION.</p><p>A: Karl Marx proved wrong on all the counts.…</p><p>Q: ON A LOT OF THINGS... RIGHT, SURE, RIGHT -- ANOTHER ISM. YOU'VE
SAID SOME REALLY CRITICAL THINGS ABOUT COMMUNISM. DO YOU MEAN COMMUNISM
AS THE SYSTEM IN THE SOVIET UNION AT THE MOMENT, OR DO YOU MEAN THE
COMMUNISM ENVISAGED BY KARL MARX AND ENGELS?</p><p>A: I mean both. Karl Marx, Engels, they were simply bookworms. Karl
Marx spent his whole life in the British Museum. He knew nothing about
the real humanity. He knew nothing about the mechanics of how evolution
goes on. He was only concerned with the British Museum. Before the
museum opened he was there, standing, and many times he was carried out
of the museum unconscious, because he worked so hard on the books that
he was found unconscious and had to be taken in an ambulance.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAYBE HE MEDITATED TOO MUCH... LAPSED INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS.</p><p>A: He never meditated for a single moment. If he had meditated for a
single moment, communism would have a different quality and flavor to
it. He was simply the mind. And meditation is a state of no mind. You
don't go for meditation to the British Museum.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a scholar, a great scholar, but whatsoever he said did not
prove right. He was thinking that communism would happen in the richest
countries, which was a logical conclusion of his philosophy, that where
the division between the poor and the rich is bigger the revolution will
happen. And the revolution has happened in Soviet Russia -- which he had
never dreamed -- revolution has happened in China. If he wakes up in his
grave, he will not be able to believe what has happened. Soviet Russia
was a poor country, China even poorer; his whole idea of class struggle
went wrong.</p><p>In America there is no possibility for communism for the simple
reason that most of the Americans are middle class. The super-rich are
few, on one hand, and the super-poor are few, on the other hand; and the
middle class is never for revolution The middle class has too much to
risk. Revolution is possible only when you have nothing to lose. The
middle class has much to lose, and the middle class also has the hope
that sooner or later they are going to enter into the higher, the
super-rich. They cannot lose that hope by creating a revolution.</p><p>I am completely against Karl Marx for the simple reason that no two
human beings are equal. Equality is psychologically wrong,
physiologically wrong. Every individual is unique and incomparable. I am
not saying that somebody is higher and somebody is lower. I am simply
saying it is absurd to compare a marigold with a rose flower. It is not
that the rose flower is higher and the marigold is poor; they are
different. People are so different and unique.</p><p>I believe in the individuality of human beings, and I don't want them
to be counted in a class that makes numbers of them and destroys their
individuality: you are the proletariat. Then the dass is important, you
are not. That's what has happened in Russia. All individuality has been
erased, and if anybody tries to be individual, like the man Sakharov,
then immediately he is punished. You cannot be individuals. The nation,
the society, the communist party -- you can be a member, but you cannot
assert your individuality. Now, Sakharov is one of the best physicists
of the contemporary world, and he is suffering in Siberia. And he had
not done anything.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EXCEPT DISAGREE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:... Just he had signed a few petitions for other scientists who
were suffering, and this was enough to finish that man completely.</p><p>Q: WITH YOUR BELIEF IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE SUPREMACY OF THAT, THEN
THE USA WOULD BE THE PLACE FOR YOU TO BE, OF COURSE, WOULDN'T IT? -- AND
HERE YOU ARE. BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST THE NATIONAL PHILOSOPHY, ALMOST THE
CULT -- IT'S BEEN CALLED THE CULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL, HASN'T IT? BUT
THERE ARE CRITICS WHO SAY THAT IT LEADS TO LACK OF COMPASSION, A LACK OF
CIVIC SENSE, A LACK OF SOCIAL COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT'S WHY,
WHEN YOU SAID THERE ARE VERY FEW POOR PEOPLE, THAT MAY BE SO, COMPARED
WITH STARVING PEOPLE IN ETHIOPIA. BUT IN AMERICA'S OWN TERMS, THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF LISTS THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFICIALLY POOR --
IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS,
THE BASIC NEEDS, THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY AND SO ON.</p><p>AS YOU WELL KNOW, I'M SURE, THE REASON FOR THIS HAS BEEN GIVEN AS THE
EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUALITY TO THE POINT THAT THE COMMUNITY IS NEGLECTED,
AND YOU'VE GOT PRIVATE WEALTH AND PUBLIC SQUALOR. DO YOU ACCEPT THAT? IS
THAT A CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LIVE WITH?</p><p>A: Just wait. You have asked so many things. First, America is a
hypocritical country, so whatsoever they say is one thing and the
reality is totally different. In</p><p>these four years being here, I have started believing that Oregon
belongs to the Soviet Union, not to America.</p><p>They are fascists. They are fanatics. They talk about freedom of
expression, freedom of the individual, but we are denied everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU MEAN YOU, HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. They have been trying to destroy us in every possible way. It
is not a democracy; it is only a pretension.</p><p>Secondly, when the American government recognizes that thirty million
people here are poor, you should remember that that is according to the
American standard. Those thirty million people in India will not be
poor, they will be middle class.</p><p>Q: YES, SURE. IT'S RELATIVE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It IS very relative. To be poor in America is far better than to
be richer in India.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, IF I MAY SAY, I WOULDN'T AGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
THE CAGED BIRD, ISN'T IT? -- -BORN IN THE CAGE IS A DIFFERENT MATTER
THAN CATCHING A BIRD AND PUTTING IT IN A CAGE -- AND I AGREE WITH YOU
THAT THE POOR PERSON IN AMERICA MIGHT BE RICH COMPARED WITH THE PEASANT
IN BANGLADESH. BUT THE PEASANT IN BANGLADESH IS NOT NECESSARILY BEING
EXPOSED EVERY DAY TO INCREDIBLE RICHES. OR CERTAINLY NOT THE WAY THEY
ARE HERE. HERE, IT'S THE CONSTANT TAUNTING, ALMOST, THE CONTRAST OF THE
TWO, THAT MAKES FOR A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND DISSATISFACTION, DOES IT
NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is good; it is healthy, because it keeps them going on,
bringing their intelligence, their potential. America allows them to
struggle for themselves, and the contrast is there so they know people
can make it, people have made their mark, and if they are failing they
are responsible themselves.</p><p>In the Soviet Union they will not feel like that because there is
nobody to be compared with. The Soviet Union is a poor country, still.
It is not that the poor have disappeared and the poverty has disappeared
from Russia. On the contrary, the rich have disappeared, and poverty has
been distributed equally, so all are equally poor.</p><p>And man has a psychological necessity to have somebody ahead of him;
otherwise, he is a lazy animal. If there is nothing to achieve, nobody
to compete with, he relaxes into whatsoever situation he is in. Russia
will never become rich for the simple reason that the Russians are all
poor. They don't have anybody there whom they would also like to be. In
a free society where individuality is</p><p>respected, it is the individual's responsibility if he is poor. All
opportunities are there for him not to be poor.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE, IN JUST THIS RECENT ANSWER THAT YOU GAVE
TO MY QUESTION -- I BELIEVE THAT IF I WROTE THAT OUT VERBATIM AND SHOWED
IT TO SOMEONE WHEN I LEAVE THIS PLACE TOMORROW AND SAID THAT AN AMERICAN
CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN TOLD ME THIS LAST NIGHT, THEY WOULD READ IT AND
SAY, 'YES, OF COURSE, THAT'S THE THING THEY USUALLY DO SAY." IT SOUNDS
TO ME VERY MUCH LIKE THE WORDS OF A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN AMERICAN
POLITICIAN. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN THIS, OF COURSE, BUT I'M A BIT
SURPRISED THAT, WITH YOUR EMPHASIS OF COMPASSION, HUMANITY, LOVE OF
INDIVIDUAL, YOU COULD SOUND SO MUCH LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE, IN FACT,
ACCUSED OF HAVING NONE OF THOSE THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: In fact, it is because of my compassion and love for them that I
am saying it. I would like people to prove themselves. That is part of
my compassion. I would like them to struggle and prove their mettle, I
would not like them to become numbers. That is out of my love. And I am
not a politician, Republican or Democratic. I am not a politician at
all.</p><p>But the poor has to be given a chance to rise. Opportunities should
be made available to the poor; but communism gives no opportunity. It
forces equality, which is wrong. In that equality, the people who are
genius creators of wealth disappear. Henry Ford cannot be born in Soviet
Russia. Even Karl Marx cannot be born in Soviet Russia; impossible! --
they won't allow such a man.</p><p>It is my compassion. It is not my politics; it is my love. And people
have the potential, you just have to give them the challenge. And if the
American government is failing with thirty million people, it is not the
philosophy of individuality; it is the American government's stupidity.
They should make more opportunities available -- and they can, but their
whole energy is going into nuclear weapons. In America there is no need
for anybody to be poor, but the American government is interested in
nuclear weapons. They have another race going on with Soviet Russia
which keeps Russia poor, which keeps America's thirty million poor, and
small poor countries also joining in the race out of fear. This nuclear
race is making the whole world a big Ethiopia. I would like the American
government to stop completely piling up nuclear weapons. Those thirty
million poor will disappear tomorrow. And it is so absurd to go on
piling up more and more nuclear weapons, because you have already more
than you need. You can destroy humanity seven hundred times, so what
more do you want?</p><p>Q: AND YOU BELIEVE IF I READ YOUR MESSAGE CORRECTLY, IN THE QUOTATION
FROM YOUR BOOK -- YOU BELIEVE THIS IS INEVITABLE, THEN, THE WAY THINGS
ARE GOING, THAT THERE WILL BE A HOLOCAUST NUCLEAR STYLE. DOES THIS
INCLUDE THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST ABOUT 1990? YOU GAVE A DATE THAT BETWEEN
NOW AND -- DID YOU SAY 1990, WAS IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just by the end of the century, because the way things are going
-- and they go on continuing -- at the most they can take fifteen years
to reach to the climax and then have an explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I CAN THOROUGHLY ACCEPT AND SEE YOUR REASONING ABOUT THE NUCLEAR
THREAT AND THE INEVITABILITY OF A HOLOCAUST, BUT DID YOU NOT ALSO SAY
THAT YOU THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE CATACLYSMIC EVENTS -- I THINK YOU SAID
IN CALIFORNIA, PARTICULARLY, AND ELSEWHERE -- OF THE KIND ASSOCIATED
WITH NATURE, GEOGRAPHY: CATASTROPHES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES? HOW DO YOU
KNOW THIS?</p><p>A: That too is not a vision. I am not a visionary. That too is part
of my reasoning. For example, in my childhood in India, the seasons were
absolutely fixed. On a certain day every year for thousands of years the
summer has begun, on a certain day the rains have come -- it was
absolutely fixed, there was no question of change. But after Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, that changed. Now in India the weather is no more certain.
Something great has happened in the atmosphere.</p><p>And these explosions go on. They go on trying in the oceans, at the
poles, and if these explosions go on, there is a possibility that the
eternal snow of the Himalayas may start melting down. Even if the
Himalayas alone melt down, all the oceans will be raised fifty feet. And
that is only the Himalayas -- if the North Pole and South Pole also join
together, and other small mountains follow, which is natural, then
cities like Bombay, Calcutta, Karachi, New York, San Francisco, poor
Portland -- all will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN FACT, THE WEATHER IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DIFFERENT, I KNOW
THROUGH MY OWN EXPERIENCE. IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS THE USUAL
PATTERN HAS GONE AWRY. IS THAT WHY YOU SELECTED CALIFORNIA AS THE SCENE
OF THE WORST DISASTERS THAT YOU FEAR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For many reasons. One, California is in the most perverted
psychological state in the whole world: more homosexuality, more
lesbianism, more AIDS. Perhaps the ocean will not need to destroy them;
they will destroy themselves.</p><p>Q: IT SEEMS I'M GETTING ALL MY INFORMATION OUT OF MY HOTEL ROOM; BUT
I SAW IN MY BATHROOM A NOTICE THAT SAID THAT AIDS WILL KILL TWO THIRDS
OF THE WORLD.…</p><p>A: Perhaps more.</p><p>Q: THAT'S AMAZING... I THINK THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION, ISN'T IT? I'VE
NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING APPROACHING THAT NUMBER.</p><p>A: It is not the maximum number, it is the minimum. Q: TWO
THIRDS?</p><p>A: Yes -- for the simple reason people are not thinking of it,
because they are not aware of what AIDS is. They have only heard the
name; they don't see the implications of it and how it can spread like
wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, HOW?</p><p>A: For example: first, wherever there is homosexuality, lesbianism,
it is going to spread immediately. One contact with a homosexual is
enough for you to get it. Not only that, even kissing a person who has
AIDS is enough for the transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DOCTORS DISAGREE WITH YOU. THEY SAY ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE.</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY DO!</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There are doctors who agree. There is no problem in it: your
mouth, my mouth, they all carry thousands of cells, living cells, and
saliva is one of the things that carries the AIDS to your mouth. Kissing
should be absolutely prohibited.</p><p>Q: HAVE YOU MENTIONED THAT TO...?</p><p>A: To my people I have mentioned. I have told them to start rubbing
noses with each other. And there are a few experts who say that there is
a possibility even that AIDS can spread just by breathing. It is not yet
established and agreed by all, but the possibility is there; and if AIDS
can spread through breathing, then it is impossible to avoid it. No
precautions can be taken, unless everybody wears a</p><p>doctor's mask. Only Jaina monks do in India -- they will be saved.
They cover both their face and their nose, for different reasons -- they
were not aware of AlDS -- but they will be saved.</p><p>Q: WELL, YOU TAKE A VERY PESSIMISTIC VIEW, BUT MAY I PUT THIS TO YOU:
GOING BACK TO THE IDEA OF CULTS -- AND YOU SAID THIS IS NOT A CULT, AND
YOUR REASONING IS DIFFERENT, I KNOW, FROM A PSYCHOLOGIST, BUT THERE IS A
PSYCHOLOGIST WHO STUDIED CULTS IN THE USA AND ELSEWHERE CALLED DR.
MARGARET SINGER. HAVE YOU HEARD OF HER? SHE'S EMINENT AND HAS IMPECCABLE
ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS AND SO ON, AND SHE HAS STUDIED A LOT OF THE CULTS.
AND SHE SAYS THEY HAVE THINGS IN COMMON, AND SOME OF THE THINGS SHE
MENTIONS COULD APPLY HERE.</p><p>ONE OF THE THINGS SHE MENTIONS IN PARTICULAR IS THE CREATION OF WHAT
SHE CALLS "GROUP PARANOIA." AND THAT IS, THAT IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEADING OR ARE PROMINENT IN THE CULT TO CREATE THE
SENSE OF GROUP PARANOIA, BECAUSE BY DOING SO THEY ACHIEVE GREATER
LOYALTY, GREATER COMMITMENT FROM THE FAITHFUL.</p><p>WHEN I SEE THE GUNS AND THE SEARCH, AND I SIGN FIVE DOCUMENTS AS A
VISITOR, AND WHEN I HEAR YOU ON THE SUBJECT OF AIDS AND NUCLEAR WAR --
WELL MANY OTHERS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT -- BUT YOUR FATALISTIC WORDS ON
THE SUBJECT OF AIDS... IT SORT OF ADDS UP.</p><p>A: But let me first. Just wait a minute. Let me first finish that
impeccable lady. I</p><p>love ladies, but not impeccable ladies.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT SHE HAS DEVOTED MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE TO THE STUDY OF
RELIGIOUS CULTS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: She is an idiot if she has spent so much time studying cults. Has
she studied Christianity as a cult?</p><p>Q: OH, YEAH A: No!</p><p>Q: OH, YES. I MEAN, SHE DEALS. SHE DISCUSSES THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Not Christianity. Not Hinduism, not Buddhism, not
Mohammedanism. In the cults they will study the Hare Krishna movement,
Scientology, the Moonies. And remember, whatsoever criteria they have.
For example, if she says that the</p><p>group has to be in a kind of paranoia, then she should come here and
see. Nobody has any paranoia.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, AS I SAY, I DON'T OBJECT TO IT, AND I AGREED BEFORE I CAME;
BUT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHED, MY LUGGAGE HAS BEEN SEARCHED, AND A DOG HAS
SNIFFED OVER THE HIRED CAR THAT I.… AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAPPEN TO ME
WHEN I GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.</p><p>A: That is because we have been persecuted by the Oregon government
and the American government. The responsibility is theirs. We don't
like... we hate to search anybody! But what are they trying to do? To
send drugs with somebody. They have not been able to find anything
against us in four years; now they want to plant. And once we became
aware from very reliable sources that now they are trying to plant, that
they want to bring drugs or other things and plant them here, then we
had to start that search.</p><p>That is not paranoia, that is simply precaution against idiotic
politicians. We have done no harm to anybody, we don't mean to do any
harm to anybody. In fact, I hate anybody searching; it is a humiliation,
distrust. I don't want to distrust anybody, but what to do? They have
tried even to bribe my sannyasins. And whatever I am saying to you may
reach to them within just a few hours. They have planted their people
amongst the sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OH, SURE. I'LL BET THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FBI PEOPLE SITTING HERE,
RIGHT NOW. NO, THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE, I AGREE.</p><p>A: So that's why we had to be cautious. It is such a small commune,
they can find anything and destroy it. We will make every effort not to
let them do what they want to do. The dog is not searching you; the dog
is searching the Attorney General of Oregon. So you please don't feel
offended. Those guns are not for you; those guns are for those
Oregonians who have been saying that they would like to shoot me, that
they would like to destroy, burn the whole commune.</p><p>We will do everything. We are not suicidal people, nor do we hanker
for any martyrdom. This is not another Jonestown. They forced the
Jonestown people to commit suicide. We are not the people to commit
suicide. We love life, and we will do everything that is possible to
prevent their doing any harm to us. Even if we have to invite Soviet
Russia for our protection, we are going to do that!</p><p>Q: BUT ALL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OREGON HAS DONE TO YOU, IT SEEMS
TO ME, IS HARASS YOU WITH LAWSUITS. HE HASN'T SENT ANY PEOPLE WITH GUNS.
I MEAN, HE HASN'T SHOT AT YOU. I MEAN, THE MAN WHO BLEW UP THE HOTEL MAY
HAVE BEEN A RANDOM MADMAN.…</p><p>A: No, he is not mad; because he jumped bail and for one and a half
years he has been hiding. Now he has been caught again. He is not
mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, MAD PEOPLE CAN RUN AWAY AS WELL AS SANE PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Mad people will not be so intelligent, the way he has been.
But I'm not concerned with that</p><p>I am concerned with the Attorney General and the Governor. They had a
secret meeting. They did not allow any journalists -- they talk about
freedom! -- and the meeting was about us. They did not even allow one of
our representatives so that he could present the case from our side. And
the Governor told the press, "I will give you the information after our
meeting." And whatsoever he said was an absolute lie...! Because the
confidential secret file has been found. They thought that it had been
burned, but it has been found, and it has been shown on television.</p><p>In the secret file, they say that the army should be kept on alert,
that the army should be aware that if they are ordered, then in three
hours they have to reach Rajneeshpuram. And you ask me about these few
toy guns that my people have! And this man, Governor Atiyeh, told the
press conference,</p><p>"We are trying to cool down the atmosphere. We are trying to get the
commune people and the people of Oregon to cool down, not to get too
heated." This is what he gave to the press conference. And inside the
conference, they decide for the army to be ready so they can reach here
in three hours' time.</p><p>We have now filed a case against the state for conspiracy. Now we
have the document, and what have we done that they think they need the
army and the military to reach here? So these few toy guns are just...
my people love me and they want to protect me. But you should understand
that it is silly. What can you do with these toy guns? In a nuclear age,
these toy guns should be given to children to play with.</p><p>Q: BUT I DON'T SEE, PERSONALLY, THAT THERE'S NEED FOR SUCH WEAPONRY
BECAUSE THE THREAT HASN'T BEEN OF THAT MAGNITUDE.</p><p>A: No? You think putting the army on alert and telling them to be
ready any moment...?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I HAVEN'T READ THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: You don't know that. Your ignorance does not mean that you have to
make an opinion -- then try to know it before you make an opinion.</p><p>Q: I MEAN, I MIGHT ASK FOR PROOF. THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, IF IT WAS ON A
DOCUMENT. THEN I WOULD ACCEPT IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. You can see it.</p><p>(ASIDE) Perhaps you have the full document? Okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT THEY CALL A CONTINGENCY PLAN,
ISN'T IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Whatsoever they call it... but that means certainly they want to
harm us. Q: WHY DO THEY WANT TO DO THIS?</p><p>A: That you have to ask them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, THEY DENY IT. THEY SAY, AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THAT SOME
VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS THEY FEEL YOU MAY HAVE CONTRAVENED IN THE OPINIONS
OF SOME LAWYERS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: We are in the courts, and we have won almost fifty percent of the
cases. The remaining fifty percent we are going to win; because it is so
true, they cannot.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE MATTER, IT
SEEMS?</p><p>A: They will appeal if they fail here. Or if we fail, we will appeal.
It is not going to end easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT SUPPOSING THEY EXHAUST ALL THE LEGAL POSSIBILITIES TO THE
SUPREME COURT IN WASHINGTON, AND YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE CASE, DO YOU THEN
THINK THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We will then invite them to drop bombs on us and finish us.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OH, COME ON! I KNOW THE POLICE DID IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT SO I
SUPPOSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN DONE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's what I will do: invite them, and finish it. But we are not
going to leave this place alive! If they want us to leave this place,
they will have to destroy --</p><p>and with it they will have to destroy their mask of democracy,
respect for individuality, the Constitution and freedom of expression.
All that will go down the drain with Rajneeshpuram.</p><p>And it will be a good experiment to do something like Hiroshima. We
will enjoy it. We will celebrate it.</p><p>Q: I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK DR. MARGARET SINGER WOULD BE VERY
INTERESTED IN THAT COMMENT YOU JUST MADE. I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT WHAT YOU
ARE SAYING ABOUT THE SUICIDE, BUT YOU DO HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON WITH
REVEREND JIM JONES. HE ALSO SAID, "WE'LL ASK THE SOVIETS FOR HELP, IF WE
NEED IT." AND HE WAS REFERRING TO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. DOES THAT
BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAY THAT YOU SHARE THAT SAME...?</p><p>A: No. He was a Christian, a Christian priest, and he had a
congregation of the most retarded black people. And there is nothing
common between me and him.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EXCEPT THAT APPEAL TO THE SOVIET UNION.</p><p>A: With that appeal I am saying that we are not going to die so
easily as they think. We will fight. Although we are such a small
community, we will fight in every possible way. If legal ways are
finished, then too we will fight; because basically we know we are being
true, and they are being fascist. And we are not afraid, remember --
they are afraid.</p><p>Tell that impeccable lady that we are not living in paranoia. The
whole of Oregon is living in paranoia: they are afraid. Journalists have
been telling me that people are afraid that we are going to take over
Oregon. I said, "Oregon! So small a thing... we will not bother. We
would like to take over the whole world."</p><p>And our way of taking the whole world is totally different; it is not
war. I will just go on spreading my red people around the world. We will
take it spiritually.</p><p>Q: WELL, AS I SAY, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT YOU TAKE SUCH A GLOOMY VIEW
OF THE INTENTIONS OF THE OREGON STATE GOVERNMENT, BUT I FIND IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY PLANS THE DEATH OF YOU OR YOUR
FOLLOWERS BECAUSE THAT STRIKES ME AS HYPERBOLE, TO SAY THE VERY
LEAST.</p><p><br></p><p>A: You don't know what has happened to me in the past, that's why.
Attempts on my life have been made in India. I have been given poison, a
knife has been thrown at me before ten thousand sannyasins. And it is a
miracle that ten thousand sannyasins were eyewitnesses; and because the
police got the information that something is coming, they had reached
there before the person</p><p>who was to throw the knife. So there were twenty police officers --
eyewitnesses. Still we lost the case. Ten thousand eyewitnesses, twenty
police officers as eyewitnesses; still we lost the case because that man
was a Hindu chauvinist and the Maharashtra government is a Hindu
chauvinist government.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE ATTEMPTING
TO MURDER A POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS LEADER -- AND AFTER ALL, MAHATMA
GANDHI WAS ASSASSINATED, WAS HE NOT? -- ISN'T THERE A WORLD OF
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THE PLANNED BOMBING OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY
SUCH AS YOU HAVE HERE? WHAT WERE YOUR MARIGOLD AND A ROSE AGAIN? --
INCOMPARABLE.</p><p>A: I am saying it because I don't go anywhere; it is very difficult
to assassinate me. It was easy in India because I was traveling. It is
no longer easy to assassinate me. Because that has become impossible for
them, that gives the possibility for them to destroy the whole community
with me.</p><p>But we are not afraid about it -- that you have to remember.</p><p>Q: OH, I HAVE NO DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR RESOLVE; IT'S YOUR REASON THAT
BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HATE YOU SO MUCH
THAT THEY WANT TO MURDER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because I am against all the religions, and here, particularly,
against Christianity. I am against all the politicians because I think
the world has suffered for thousands of years because of the
politicians. They are the greatest criminals around. I don't agree with
any kind of morality in which they believe. I think it is immoral. I
have my own conception of morality. I don't believe in marriage, I think
marriage is an ugly institution which has put the whole humanity in a
madhouse.</p><p>The problem is that I stand for totally different values and they are
afraid because they have no argument. We have been inviting the
Governor, "Come here. Let us have an open argument." He would not come.
For four years, he would not come.</p><p>Q: THAT STRIKES ME AS UNREASONABLE, I MUST SAY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: We are ready to have an open discussion. Anybody they can find to
stand for their values... I am ready to discuss our values. That seems
to be the human way to decide a thing. But none of them is ready to come
here. They are in a paranoia; they think anybody who comes here is
hypnotized. So, you be aware!</p><p>Q: SHALL WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT? OR DO YOU WISH TO GO? A: No.</p><p>Q: I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ONE THING MORE. I ADMIRED YOUR COMMENT AS
QUOTED HERE ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN AND YOUR ARDENT SUPPORT OF WHAT SOME
PEOPLE WILL CALL FEMINISM OR EQUALITY. I ALSO SEE A LOT OF YOUR PEOPLE
ORGANIZING HERE ARE WOMEN. IS THAT ANOTHER OF THE THINGS THEY PROBABLY
HAVE AGAINST YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That too, certainly, because I am against all that man has done to
woman. And in my own way I am trying to do a little compensation.</p><p>Q. TO SOMEONE OBSERVING THE VARIOUS VIEWS THAT YOU HAVE -- IT IS
QUITE A MIXTURE, BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR VIEWS APPEAR CONSERVATIVE, SOME
APPEAR QUITE RADICAL, OTHERS APPEAR REFORMIST/LIBERAL, IF YOU LIKE --
HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO ENCOMPASS SO MANY THINGS WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY
DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER? HOW CAN YOU BE ALL THOSE THINGS ALL AT
ONCE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not a mediocre thinker. My consciousness is vast enough to
contain all, all contradictions, but within me they become complementary
to each other. So you can find anything you want in my writings. If you
love me, you can find everything that makes your love deeper; if you
hate me, you can find everything that makes your hate deeper. I give
opportunity to all kinds of people to choose whatever they want to
choose. I am vast.</p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU. I'VE ENJOYED OUR DISCUSSION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Come again.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-16>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 27.]</p><p>Ma Prem Arup</p><p>DE RAJNEESH TIMES AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS</p><p>QUESTION: BHAGWAN, YOU ONCE SAID, "HOLLAND WILL BE ONE OF MY MOST
ORANGE COUNTRIES." WHY IS THAT SO?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: You can see it already happening. It needs guts to be my red
people, and Holland is one of the countries which has existed all
through history with tremendous struggle, because the earth level is low
and the sea level is higher. Holland has been continuously fighting
against the ocean, and it has given a certain strength to the people.
Only those who have strength to stand with me can belong to the red
commune around the world.</p><p>Holland is certainly going to be my country. My people are
continuously growing in Holland.</p><p>You will be surprised to know the fact that when the theosophical
movement decided to declare J. Krishnamurti as the world teacher,
Holland was the country chosen for the declaration. Six thousand topmost
leaders of the Theosophical Society had gathered there in Holland.</p><p>Out of all the countries, why Holland? There is something very
essential that the Dutch people have grown within them; just somebody
needs to trigger it. J. Krishnamurti chickened out, could not take that
great responsibility. I can take any responsibility without any problem,
because basically I am an irresponsible man -- it does not matter.</p><p>But the Dutch people have grown something in them down the centuries
which can have a synchronicity with me; the same with the German people.
Germany cannot remain without becoming red, because they have been
through two wars which would have destroyed anybody forever; but if you
go to Germany now, you cannot believe that this country has survived two
world wars -- not only survived, but is now the richest country in
Europe. They have some guts.</p><p>I cannot say the same about the French. They are simply lousy. There
is no possibility for France. It is doomed; it has no spiritual corner
in its being. Yes, a few French people will be coming, those who have
still the soul alive in them.</p><p>But about the whole country this cannot be said. Every country grows
in different ways on different lines and gathers a different kind of
energy. One of the reasons why Gurdjieff failed and could not help
humanity was that he chose France to be his headquarters. Germany would
have been of much significance, Holland would have been better, but not
France.</p><p>France has become satisfied with women and wine. It has no
aspirations for something beyond the horizon. It is very limited in its
vision and very closed too, because it is a very egoist country. France
thinks itself to be the most superior country in the world. Their
language is the most superior, their philosophy is the most superior,
their paintings are the most superior. These are just ornaments for the
ego, and the more a country is surrounded by egoistic projections, the
less is the possibility of its transformation.</p><p>On the other hand, Germany has given birth to the biggest genuises in
philosophy, in theology has produced the greatest mystics, but it has no
bragging about it. As I have felt people from almost all over the world,
I can say certainly that it is hard to bring a German to transformation,
hard because he will resist and fight; but if you go on persisting, the
day he drops his resistance he is forever yours. Then there is no way
back. Then he will never waver. You cannot say that about the American.
You can predict that he is going to waver.</p><p>American history is only three hundred years old, and America is not
an ancient race. It is not a race at all; it is a hodgepodge. The French
are there, the English are there, the Spanish are there, the Portuguese
are there, the Italians are there... it is a marketplace. People don't
have roots, and to have strength you need roots. The deeper the roots
go... yes, it is harder to change you, but once you are changed, it is
almost impossible for you to fall back. Once a German is deprogrammed,
nobody can reprogram him again. The American can be reprogrammed within
two days and you can deprogram him again within two days. He has no
roots.</p><p>In India, we have a certain creeper without roots. It simply lives as
a parasite on other trees, from one tree to another tree. It spreads far
-- sometimes miles, in the forest -- but it has no roots, it simply
lives on those other trees.</p><p>Americans are simply like that creeper: they don't have any roots;
they don't have anything to stand upon, their past is so small. That's
why they cannot project about the future either, because this is the
logical way: the longer the past, the longer you can project the
future.</p><p>The third world war is just knocking on the doors. This century is
going to end, and with the end of this century either we have the new
man on the earth or no life at all. But Americans are fast asleep.</p><p>Many Americans have come to me. In almost twenty years, many have
come, many have gone, very few have stayed. And those who have stayed
are really not Americans. The American Jew has stayed with me, because
he has no country; he has only his past, but a long past and of
tremendous importance. He knows how to deal with people like Moses,
Ezekiel, Jesus, Baal Shem.</p><p>And what does America know? Henry Ford, Rockefeller? -- they cannot
have a deep intimacy with me.</p><p>Yes, a few Americans have remained with me. Mukta is sitting there,
but she is not really American, she is Greek. The American generation is
just changing continuously -- everything is a fashion. They can come to
me also as part of a fashionable movement, but they are not going to
remain here, because soon they get attracted to something else. They
don't know how to grow roots.</p><p>And different countries have different ways. It is not a coincidence
that forty percent of my people are Jews. And I have been hitting hard
on Jews -- so much so that rabbis have started writing letters to me
saying, "You seem to be anti- Jewish." They don't know that Jews are the
majority of my people, and I can hit on them because I love them and
they understand my love. In my hit, they receive my love.</p><p>Not a single Jew has left me. Once he has come, he has come forever,
he has found his Israel in me. He need not go to Jerusalem, he need not
bother about Moses and Jesus; there is no need. They have found a more
contemporary Moses here.</p><p>Each country can be given a certain characteristic. For example,
Indians: they pretend to be spiritualists, and that is the most
materialistic country in the whole world, most greedy. They could not be
with me for the simple reason that I was exposing them -- and unless I
expose you totally, you cannot be reborn.</p><p>Indians started escaping from me the moment I started exposing them.
They took the hint, and it was right: they are greedy, they are
materialist; they don't have any longing for spirituality, only
pretensions. Yes, once, twenty-five centuries ago, perhaps they were
spiritual, and that idea of the past has followed them like a shadow.
But they forget completely that for twenty-five centuries you cannot go
on pretending that the shadow that is following you is alive. Indian
spirituality is dead, and I don't see much hope for its revival.</p><p>But a few Indians have been with me all along, in all the seasons, in
all the changes. So when I say something about a country, it does not
apply to individuals. Now Avesh is sitting there -- a great Frenchman --
and he is going to sit there forever. I have destroyed his French-ship
completely. Arup herself is Dutch. Can she conceive of ever leaving me?
Not even in dreams; it is impossible. I can say that with certainty,
because love is never uncertain.</p><p>England is so sad and depressed -- obviously: they were on the top,
they had the biggest empire any country ever had. It was said that the
sun never sets in the</p><p>British Empire, somewhere or other it is always rising. As far as the
whole Empire was concerned, the sun was always rising somewhere; it
never set in the British Empire. Neither Alexander, nor Napoleon, nor
Hitler, nor Stalin has known such a vast empire. Nobody has been able to
know such immense power, and suddenly all that has disappeared like
writing on water. It is natural that they will be so depressed, sad.
They would not like to come out of their depression. They cannot accept
laughing, dancing, singing. They have lost so</p><p>much, and you are thinking to dance? They have lost everything, and
you are proposing, "Let us sing a beautiful song!"</p><p>England will find it more difficult than anybody else to be with me.
But that does not apply to individuals, let me remind you again. Teertha
is there... the moment he entered my room, many years ago, not for a
single moment has he left, not even to visit England again. He has
dropped his wife, he has dropped his parents, he has dropped everything.
He was a well-known encounter leader, he had the best growth institute
in Europe; but once he looked into my eyes, all that was finished. I
knew it, he knew it -- that he was bound that day and a new life began
which had nothing to do with the past.</p><p>Individuals will be coming from everywhere, but a few countries have
more potential. For example, it is very difficult to get into the
Mohammedan countries</p><p>-- almost impossible, because they are still so uncivilized.
Civilization has not happened anywhere, but there are countries which
are a little less uncivilized and there are countries which are more
uncivilized. Civilization is still waiting to happen. It is waiting to
happen for you: you are to become the heralds of civilization.</p><p>But Mohammedan countries are not even contemporaries. They have not
moved a single inch from the times of Mohammed. Fourteen centuries have
passed and they are still thinking that the Koran is the holy book. In
the Koran ninety-nine percent is just nonsense. One percent you can
manage to give some spiritual meaning, with great effort, otherwise it
is not of any importance. And Mohammedans have remained faithful to the
Koran. They are not ready even to listen to anybody.</p><p>A few Mohammedans are my sannyasins, but those poor people ask me,
"Bhagwan, we want to be sannyasins, we want to be contemporaries, we
want to have the revolution that you are giving us, but we cannot go in
red clothes back home. They will simply kill... they don't argue."</p><p>Mohammedans don't know argument. They don't know any philosophy.
Their only argument is the sword: either kill them, or be killed by
them; whosoever is killed was wrong. That is strange. It is very easy to
kill Socrates, any idiot like Muhammad Ali can kill Socrates without any
difficulty. Socrates is not a wrestler, he is not a boxer; just a good
punch on his nose and he will be finished with all his philosophy.
Physical strength or strength that comes through weapons cannot be a
substitute for argument. Argument needs intelligence, and that
intelligence is missing there.</p><p>In India, I had come in contact with hundreds of Mohammedans. You may
not know that India is still the biggest Mohammedan country in the world
as far as numbers are concerned, even after the division with Pakistan.
When Pakistan and Bangladesh were one with India, of course, half the
population of Mohammedans was in India. But even after Pakistan was
separated, Bangladesh got separated, still India had a larger Mohammedan
population than any other</p><p>country. Countries which are completely Mohammedan -- even they are
far behind.</p><p>These Mohammedans in India are a little better than any Mohammedans
in any other country because for centuries they have been living with
all kinds of philosophers, all kinds of religions, all kinds of
attitudes, approaches. Obviously their fanaticism has become less, but
even that fanaticism is enough to kill you. You cannot say anything
against one holy book -- and that is Koran; one God -- and that is that
of Islam; and one prophet -- and that is Mohammed. In these three
statements, the whole Mohammedanism is complete. You cannot speak
against any of these three... and there is so much to say against all
these three.</p><p>The Mohammedan God does not look like a God at all, their holy book
is just rubbish, and their one and only one prophet is just an
uneducated, uncultured man, with no idea of philosophical heights, with
no knowledge of anything, who has never meditated in his life. He knows
nothing about meditation.</p><p>But the sannyasins who are Mohammedans have asked me, "Give us
permission. We will keep the mala hidden in our houses, we will keep the
robe</p><p>hidden in our houses, we cannot even let our family know about it
because that will be just the end. And if you want," they have told me,
"that we should be killed, we are ready."</p><p>Now, I am not a fanatic about the color of the dress or the mala. I
said, "Don't be worried about it. I need your heart, and if that has
become red.… I need to be within you. If I have reached there, then
don't be worried. And I don't want anybody to be killed in my name, I
want people to live longer, healthier, happier in my name."</p><p>Mohammed says to Mohammedans, "If you die in my name, your paradise
is certain." I say to you, "If you live in my name and love in my name
and dance in my name, you are already in paradise." I don't guarantee
anything about the future, how can I tell anybody to die in my name?</p><p>The earth is so small and it is divided in so many different groups
who have grown differently, had different histories -- and their past is
significant, that has to be taken into account. So, whenever I have said
anything about Holland, or Germany, or England, I was simply indicating
the possibility.</p><p>I have so many Italians -- but not reliable; well greased and
slippery! They try hard, nice people, but what can they do about their
greasiness? Some thing in them is always slippery. Many Italians have
come to me, very few have stayed. Those who have stayed have changed a
lot, but still something of greasiness is there. Now they are not going
to slip back, but the possibility remains. they are</p><p>not absolutely out of it.</p><p>But if we can get the right people, the people who are not that ripe
may start following them. That's how the human mind functions; it is
imitative. If we have enough red people around the earth, then more and
more Italians will slip into being red people. Slipperiness has no
direction, you just have to give them the right place from where to
slip.</p><p>And if we can create a rejoicing around the world, how long can
England remain depressed? Nobody wants to be depressed. How long can
they go on singing "God Save the King"? And what about them? God only
saves the queen or the king? -- what about the people? God has not been
in favor of the people.</p><p>Those people are waiting for something to happen in the world that
can drag them out of their gloominess, their depressiveness, and can
make them free, free of the glory that they had of the empire, which
they are missing.</p><p>We can give them a new glory which nobody can take away from them.
That glory that they had was really ugly: exploiting people, poor people
all around the world -- and your whole joy was dependent on these
starving people, and you went on exploiting them. If you are sad and
depressed today, it is the consequence of your own actions. You have
made millions of people sad, depressed, you have killed millions of
people around the world to save the empire; now who is going to suffer
the consequences?</p><p>England is now a dark hole. That does not mean that people want to
live in that dark hole, but we have to make an effort to reach into
their darkness with our torches, we have to throw ropes into that dark
hole. Somebody is bound to catch hold of the rope and we can pull him
out. And it is a question only of a few people starting moving, and
others may follow.</p><p>So in every country we have to work in a different way, seeing the
country's characteristic. Now we have communes all around the world.
Every commune has to understand what kind of people you are surrounded
with, and what can be done so that they can be pulled within you. It is
simple arithmetic.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WERNER ERHARD, THE
BUSINESSMAN WHO DISCOVERED THAT PERSONAL GROWTH SELLS BETTER THAN
ENCYCLOPEDIAS, YOU SAID THAT THE BUSINESS OF GROWTH IS JUST AN AMERICAN
NAME FOR GOD.</p><p>THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER CHRONICLE, REPORTING THIS, NOTED THAT YOU
DID NOT COMMENT ON THE PERSONAL GROWTH MARKETING OF YOUR OWN RAJNEESH
INTERNATIONAL MEDITATION UNIVERSITY HERE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AND
WHAT PART DOES THE UNIVERSITY PLAY IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNE?</p><p>A: The difference is great. He was a door-to-door salesman of
encyclopedias. Our university is not going door-to-door to sell anything
to anybody.</p><p>Our university is a well. Those who are thirsty can come and drink
out of it. It is available, but we are not persuading anybody. On the
contrary, I am making every effort to offend them, to make them angry,
become our enemies. Do you think this is business tactics?</p><p>In business, the customer is always right. Here the situation is
totally different: the customer is always wrong. From whatsoever source
he comes, he is always wrong -- and he comes on his own, in spite of all
that I go on doing continuously</p><p>to prevent him from coming. Nobody in the whole world has offended so
many people as I alone have done, singlehandedly.</p><p>But even after all this turmoil that I create, and offensiveness and
antagonism in their minds, a few daring people come. These people can be
relied upon. Just their coming is significant. Certainly, my university
is not part of the marketplace.</p><p>Werner Erhard was part of the market world. He was taking his est
from one hotel to another hotel around the country, then outside the
country. And he was neither a philosophical man, nor religious; he had
registered est as a corporation, a business corporation. He was paying
income tax for all his incomes.</p><p>Our university is not a business. We don't have to pay any taxes for
the university. The degrees that our university gives are of no use in
the marketplace, because we don't want our degrees to be recognized by
any government or by any university or any other institution. We refuse
to be recognized by them, because just the fact that we let them
recognize us means they are somebody higher than us, somebody more
authoritative. We don't accept any government's recognition, because no
government is worthy of it.</p><p>Our university is absolutely a free phenomenon. Those who want to
come, come knowing that whatever we have to offer is of no use in the
marketplace. In fact it may make their market world more difficult for
them, because a person who comes here for three months or four months to
do a course in the university... we are not giving him growth the way
Werner Erhard was giving. He started from where you are.</p><p>Our work is first to destroy whosoever you are -- whosoever, without
any condition. We destroy you first, dismantle you first, and unless we
have deprogrammed you completely there is no growth possible. We don't
teach you any growth. To be deprogrammed... you start growing on your
own accord. Werner Erhard was teaching you techniques of growth, but if
you are a monster and you are being taught techniques of growth, you
will become a bigger monster.</p><p>Werner Erhard never offended anybody. That's simply the way of the
businessman: never offend anybody. Everybody was happy with him. The
government was happy, the churches were happy, the politicians were
happy -- not only in this country, but in other countries too. He used
to go to India to pay respect to the so-called Hindu mahatmas.
Muktananda was his guru. He even went to pay his respects to Morarji
Desai, when he was the prime minister of India. And by mistake he even
came to me, thinking I also belong to the same category of mahatmas that
he has known all his life. He must have been shocked. When he was
sitting in front of me, I could see how difficult it was for him just to
sit there. And when I told him he can ask anything, he simply said, "No,
I don't have any questions." Laxmi had given him my latest books, just
as a present. He went into the hotel -- which was not far away, just a
few minutes walk -- and gave those books to one sannyasin, Hridaya,
without even looking at them. Some</p><p>great fear must have arisen in him. Reading those books might disturb
his mind. And certainly I was not the person that he had expected. I
would have destroyed his whole est first.</p><p>I have to begin from scratch. First I have to demolish the old
building completely, I don't believe in renovation. Howsoever
beautifully you renovate a building, it still remains the old rotten
thing; just painted here and there, a little bit supported, but it is
just the old rotten building that you have given a facelift. No, it is
better to live in an A-frame, but new, fresh, young.</p><p>Werner Erhard is a businessman, there are no two opinions about it.
And nobody can compare me with Werner Erhard. Our whole approach is
totally different.</p><p>Our approach is first to deprogram the person completely, and then
leave him alone to himself. Don't give him another program. Leave him
alone, empty, just a pure nothingness. And out of that nothingness grows
everything that existence wanted to grow in that man.</p><p>We bring the person close to existence, from where he has been taken
away. Once we see that you are communing with existence, our work is
finished. We don't give you growth, we simply take away all nonsense
that is surrounding you and which perhaps you think is growth. Growth
comes of its own accord, you just have to be utterly open and
vulnerable.</p><p>I am not a businessman. I could have been and then I would have
defeated all the businessmen in the whole world. But I have chosen to
offend everybody, ready for their hostility from every nook and corner
of the world.</p><p>A businessman tries to be respectable, and I have been trying my
whole life to be notorious. Unless you understand me, you will not be
able to see why I unnecessarily create hostility in people. I am not a
businessman. I have nothing to sell to them. If they are courageous
enough to come nearer to me, I am going to burn their whole personality.
I'm going to take their whole skin off their body and then leave them
alone so they can grow fresh from the very beginning.</p><p>That growth will not be in any way a credit to me. That growth will
be a credit to the person who dared to come, who dared to pass through
the fire, who dared to risk his whole life. The whole credit goes to
him.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, GOING BACK TO HOLLAND: YOUR COMMUNE IN HOLLAND WAS LIVING
IN A PRISON AND NOW HAS MOVED INTO A MONASTERY. IS THIS PROGRESS? AND
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM HAVING A DISCO IN A CHURCH NEXT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's great. I want discos in all the churches and cathedrals and
all the mosques and all the temples around the world. They are the best
places for disco. So this is a great advance, that they have turned a
church into a disco! That's what I want.</p><p>And if they have moved to the monastery, for the first time the
monastery will have real people, not hypocrites, in it. For the first
time, the monastery will hear</p><p>laughter and singing and dancing and people loving each other. The
monastery may have seen monks who were simply monsters and nothing else.
Now the monastery will see what really the word monk means and what is
the meaning of being a monastery.</p><p>The word monk means one who is capable of being himself, individual,
alone, independent. That is the meaning of the monk: alone. It has
nothing to do with Christianity. You will recognize the word in other
words: monogamy, monopoly</p><p>-- it is the same word. Monk, monastery... MONASTERY means people
living there totally independent, completely free from any strings and
yet they have one thing in common: that they all want to be alone and
individuals. This is the common factor that keeps them together.</p><p>So it is good that our commune in Holland has moved into a monastery.
We will make it a real monastery because my people are real monks, and
the monastery will be really celebrating. My people, even if you give
them a graveyard, are going to make a carnival there. The graves will
become tables for drinking wine. They will soon turn the graveyard into
such a beautiful place that you would never imagine that thousands of
dead bodies are under the ground.</p><p>The actual fact is, wherever you are sitting, at least ten persons'
dead bodies are on that spot underneath you. So many millions of people
have lived down the millions of years, it has been calculated that not a
single inch on the earth is not a graveyard. And for all these people
who have lived on the earth and died, this is the minimum -- that on
every spot at least eight persons are buried deep down.</p><p>So there is no problem: when we can make any place a place of joy, we
can change a graveyard into a joy. Just inquire of those people. Because
it happens</p><p>often that by the side of the churches there are graveyards, by the
side of the monastery there are graveyards. If there are graveyards,
transform them into dancing places, playing grounds; fill them with
laughter and joy. Perhaps those who are buried there will have for the
first time a time which they never had in their life. It is just
great.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK SOME OF THOSE GHOSTS MIGHT STILL BE KICKING AROUND
UNDERNEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There are no ghosts. There was only one ghost -- the holy ghost --
and he too finished only by making a poor girl pregnant. Then what
happened to the holy ghost? He must have committed suicide, thinking of
the consequences that followed his making the woman pregnant, which was
illegal, criminal, irreligious, a sin.</p><p>Secondly, out of that sin, what else can you expect but Jesus Christ?
People had to crucify him. Seeing his son being crucified, do you think
the holy ghost would have survived? Since then, nothing has been heard
about him. No news. the</p><p>Vatican is silent.</p><p>There are no ghosts, there are only dead skeletons underneath. The
soul goes on moving to new forms. It depends how you have lived. Your
whole life essence determines your new form. What you have desired your
whole life and have not been able to fulfill, that desire at the last
moment of your life stands as the only thing that determines your life.
There is nobody directing anything, it is simply the law.</p><p>For example, a man goes on writing to me -- obviously he's from
California. It is so difficult to find anything right in California. The
man goes on writing to me that he loves to dress himself in women's
dresses. When he was in California, there was no problem. There are many
who are doing that and they are doing it perfectly. It is very difficult
to detect that this is a man -- with tits and all!</p><p>But here he finds it difficult, because everybody knows he is a man.
So he goes on asking me what he should do: "Should I go through plastic
surgery and become a woman?'</p><p>Now, this man if he dies will become a woman. That is his whole mind,
full of only one desire: to become a woman. And it is my experience that
this is not an exceptional case, this is the rule. Men get tired in
seventy years' life of being men, and every man thinks women are more
juicy, enjoying life more, and he has been simply sucked of all his
energy.</p><p>And the woman her whole life goes on thinking that, as a woman,
whatsoever she is going to do, she is not going to be really equal to
man. Liberation or no liberation, man is going to dominate her. The
woman carries the desire to be a man, and my experiments with many
people about their past lives even surprised me in the beginning,
because the man was a woman in the past life, the woman was a man in the
past life. For many lives you have been human beings, man or woman.</p><p>But if we go deeper, you have been animals. If you go still deeper,
you have been plants -- but that is millions of lives back. The whole
physiological, biological evolution stopped at man. This whole growth up
to now was horizontal. At this point, man has come to a crossroad. He
can go on horizontally, changing man to woman, woman to man, but there
is no growth. Now he has to take a vertical route, not horizontal. And
that vertical route is my whole effort.</p><p>Meditation is a way of giving you a vertical route. Then there is no
need to be reborn. Bodies move horizontally, souls have wings. Once you
are fully alert, aware, conscious, enlightened, then this is your last
body, because only bodies can move on the horizontal line. Now you are a
soul. You will have to move vertically.</p><p>But what a joy! Not to have a cage of bones, muscles, blood vessels,
nerve system, a skull. Sometimes it is good experience to go to a
medical college and</p><p>see a skeleton: this is you, really naked. Not only the clothes are
removed. he</p><p>has gone too far; he has removed everything. Just bones, just the
fundamental structure is there, and everything else has been
removed.</p><p>Once in a while, standing before a mirror, just close your eyes and
think that you are a skeleton. Then open your eyes and look into the
mirror. Try to figure out what kind of skeleton you have. That's why I
say you should first see a few skeletons. I suggest to Vedant and Siddha
that in the university you should have a few skeletons hanging around
all over the place, so nobody can bypass -- and that will prove also
that this is not a marketplace, and everybody has to understand that
this is your reality. When the soul is free from all bondage, it moves
into the cosmos, it becomes one with the sky, with the sunrise, with the
flowers, with the birds, with all that exists. It spreads all over. It
has no more any limitations, it is as big and vast as the whole universe
itself. That's what I call liberation. That is the end, because nothing
is more blissful, more ecstatic, than to achieve it.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, EARLIER ON YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS AND YOU WERE JUST TALKING NOW ABOUT THE LAST DESIRE AT
THE MOMENT OF DEATH, SO IF SOMEONE GETS REBORN INTO SOME NATIONALITY,
DOES THAT WHOLE NATIONAL HISTORY BECOME PART OF THE BODY, OF THE MIND,
OR HOW DOES IT CONNECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Mostly it never happens, or very rarely. A Dutch is born again in
Holland; a Hindu goes on again and again being a Hindu, because his
whole conditioning can be adjusted in a Hindu environment. Perhaps,
rarely.… I have yet to come across a person who was something else in
his past life; now he is an Italian, and in the past life he was a
German. People go on being born in the same race, in the same
atmosphere. The only change that happens is from man to woman.</p><p>Perhaps my people will find it difficult where to be reborn, because
now they don't belong to any race and they don't belong to any country.
But don't be afraid, we have so many sannyasins throughout the world,
you can get born as a sannyasin somewhere -- and there are a few
sannyasin women, sannyasin men, who want children. But I have not come
across a case where somebody is born from Tibet into India, or from
India into China. It is unnatural. The soul flows in the same rut to
which it has become accustomed.</p><p>There are many cases in India of small children remembering their
past lives. It happens only in India, for the simple reason that that is
the only country that believes in rebirth. Christians believe in only
one birth, Jews believe in only one birth, Mohammedans believe in only
one birth. It is only the religions born in India who say that there are
thousands of births. It is a long process -- seventy years is not enough
for a sleeping person to be awakened. He needs more time.</p><p>They believe it; I know it.</p><p>It is certainly true; it is not a hypothesis. But I don't want you to
believe it, because for you it will not be a truth. I would like you to
explore. Go back into your past lives -- it is really a tremendous
trick, just terrific -- and as you go</p><p>backwards, you are simply amazed what kind of person you are and how
many forms you have taken before. And this is a great help, to
understand that no form has been a contentment to you. From every form
you have died in discontent and despair, so now don't miss the chance of
moving vertically.</p><p>It is good for animals to move horizontally. Ordinarily, they also
move horizontally, and it is symbolical, really significant. The only
animal on the earth standing, against gravitation -- walking on four is
easier because it is not against gravitation, the force of gravitation
is equally distributed all over the body-you are also vertical, just as
gravitation is vertical. That's why in sleep you find so much
relaxation, because in sleep you become horizontal. You get tired
standing up, sitting long; then you need lying down.</p><p>How does that lying down bring you relaxation, rejuvenation? Just
being in tune with gravitation. Standing, you are really doing a
miracle. You are against gravitation, which pulls everything down, and
your heart has to pump blood into your head, upwards. It is a miracle
that you are performing every second. Your heart is really a rebel, a
revolution against gravitation. It is forcing blood upwards.</p><p>It is now a well-established fact why animals have not been able to
grow brains: for the simple reason that they are horizontal. In their
heads, blood flows so much that the necessary small cells which
constitute your brain-seven million cells in your small skull -- are so
small that in that flood of blood they cannot survive. They cannot be
born, either.</p><p>Just because man stood on two legs and the head became against
gravitation, a very small blood flow reaches to the head and the head
can grow a very delicate system of nerves, a delicate combination of
cells. But for that a very small and silent flow of blood is needed.</p><p>That's why I'm against anybody doing the headstand posture of yoga.
More than three seconds is dangerous; your brain cells cannot stand too
much blood coming to them for more than three seconds. And you can see
the result: not a single Hindu yogi has contributed anything to the
world. Those yogis are standing on their heads, they destroy their
brain, and the brain is the necessary instrument to create anything. The
Hindu yogis have been the most uncreative people in the world, they have
been just the parasites of our society.</p><p>So, anybody who is interested in standing on the head, it is really a
good exercise</p><p>-- but only for three seconds. Then just be back on your feet. It is
good because it refreshes your mind: just a sudden shower of blood and
the whole mind is refreshed. All the dead cells will go back when you
jump again to your feet, the blood returning back to the body will
itself take all dead cells that were hanging around in your head. The
exercise is good, but exact timing... nobody should do it more than
three seconds.</p><p>So, people are continuously born into the same culture, except a few
exceptional people -- travelers, nomads, who don't have any home, who
don't have any</p><p>attachment, who may be born into some new environment. And that's
from where the trouble child is born.</p><p>You know the word problem child. It is not the child's decision to
make any trouble, but he is a misfit, he does not belong to your
heritage, your conditions, your past. He has some other past, some other
conditions, and there is going to be a clash between the parents and the
child. Most probably the parents are going to prevail, they will destroy
the child's heritage and force him to belong to them, to their race, to
their religion.</p><p>But these children who are born into a different race, into a
different country, for some reason, are really very valuable. Any
problem child is a very valuable phenomenon. If we allow him freedom to
grow, he will bring new richness to your race, to your country. He will
introduce something that your race has never known. These children prove
to be the geniuses.</p><p>And vice versa: you can look into the lives of your geniuses and you
will always find in their childhood their parents had as much trouble
with them as human beings can tolerate. All geniuses are a trouble in
their childhood, and any child who is not a trouble in his childhood is
going to do all kinds of businesses -- Werner Erhard and all kinds of
shops and marketplaces -- but he cannot be a genius. It is difficult...
he is burdened with his own past, and his parents have burdened him with
their past. He is in a kind of split.</p><p>Perhaps this will give some insight to you about schizophrenia. Why
do some people suffer from schizophrenia? Because from two different
directions two conditions meet in them, but they cannot mix and become
one, they remain two. Sometimes one is up and the person starts speaking
in a different way, behaving in a different way; another time the other
is up and the person behaves so diametrically opposite to his normal
behavior that all you can do is take him to the psychiatrist. You start
thinking he is sick.</p><p>He is not sick, he is simply suffering because two long traditions
have met in him. All that he needs is to be a witness of both the
conditionings and separate himself, disidentify himself from both the
conditionings, and the whole schizophrenia will disappear.</p><p>In fact, the moment he disidentifies himself from both the
conditions, he will have a richness that you cannot have, because he can
use from both the conditions, both the heritages, things which he wants.
He is now the master.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-17>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 28.]</p><p>Willem Sheer PERS UNIE THE HAGUE,</p><p>NETHERLANDS</p><p>QUESTION: I HAVE BEEN READING YOUR BOOKS FOR SOME YEARS AND I HAVE
BEEN SEEING SOME VIDEOS OF YOU. AND I WAS HERE LAST WINTER AT THE WINTER
FESTIVAL. AND ONE WEEK AGO AT THE OFFICE I GOT A TELEPHONE CALL FROM
BHAGAWATI WHO ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU. SO
HERE I AM. I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 QUESTIONS. AND I CHOSE ABOUT
TWENTY... I SELECTED ABOUT TWENTY OUT OF THEM.</p><p>ANSWER: Good, let's start.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE: BHAGWAN, I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN A
CLIMATE OF CRITICAL JOURNALISM. I AM TAUGHT AS A JOURNALIST NEVER TO
BELIEVE ANYONE ON HIS WORD. ARE YOU CAPABLE TO COMMUNICATE YOUR MESSAGE
TO SUSPICIOUS JOURNALISTS? OR IS TRUST NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
REALLY MEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. No faith, no belief, no trust is needed. And what you have
been taught as a journalist, to be critical, skeptical, is exactly my
message. Be critical, be skeptical. Go on saying no until you can find
the yes which you cannot deny.</p><p>My people are not people who have gathered here because of a certain
faith or belief. They are inquirers, seekers with open minds, and they
are being taught only one thing: never accept anything unless you can
experience it. Critical journalism is just third rate, because it is
only the mind, the reason. But the mind and reason can be very easily
defeated. Just a little sharper intelligence is needed and your
criticism will be gone.</p><p>But the criticism I am teaching to my people is something far deeper
and far wider. I am teaching them not to argue about truth, because
there is no way through argument to reach the truth. Whenever two
arguments fight, all that is</p><p>proved is who was more capable of arguing. Truth is never proved that
way, truth has to be experienced. So deny every belief and deny it
absolutely. Not even a lingering shadow of belief should be within
you.</p><p>Q: SO YOUR SANNYASINS ALSO SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT YOU
SAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WHEN YOU SAY, "DO THIS AND THAT AND THIS WILL BE THE RESULT,"
THEN THEY ENTER IT WITH A SKEPTICAL, CRITICAL MIND?</p><p>A: Certainly. Whatever I say to them is hypothetical, just the way
science works. A scientist enters into an experiment with a hypothesis.
Hypothesis means not belief, but just that one has to begin somewhere,
so for the moment he accepts a certain concept and enters into it with
absolute alertness so that he is not deceived by his own hypothesis. He
has to be aware that it is only a hypothesis and not a truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU ALSO SAID, "TRUST ME, FOLLOW ME."</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is said to those people who have arrived. I have been
speaking to millions of people. And when I speak to a person, I cannot
take account of the whole world. My statement is direct and immediate
and personal. When I have said to somebody, "Trust and follow me," that
means the person has arrived. Now there is no need of any skepticism, no
negativity. Now there is no need for him to unnecessarily harass
himself, he has done enough. But not before that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO TRUST IS A LATER STATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAY I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION? I BELONG TO THE DIMINISHING MINORITY
OF DUTCH PEOPLE WHO REGARD THE HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A WONDERFUL
INSTITUTE IN WHICH A LOT OF WISDOM CAN BE FOUND. AT THE SAME TIME I
ENJOY YOUR BOOKS AND VIDEOS. IS THIS A PARADOX, AND IF SO, WHAT CAN BE
DONE ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is a paradox and you know exactly what has to be done about it.
If you could have left me, you would have left. You cannot leave me. So
the paradox is dissolved: Catholicism is finished.</p><p>Q: I MEET IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PERSONS WHOM I SINCERELY EXPERIENCE
AS SINCERE. AND I HAVE OFTEN READ THAT FOR EXAMPLE MOTHER TERESA... YOU
MOCK HER A LOT. I ONCE MET HER MYSELF AND I FOUND HER A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
WHEN I ASKED HER, "SHOULD CHRISTIANS CONVERT PEOPLE OF OTHER RELIGIONS
TO CHRISTIANITY?" SHE ANSWERED, "NO, LET EVERYBODY GO HIS OWN WAY. YOU
GO YOUR WAY TO GOD, I GO MY WAY. " AND I FOUND HER A SINCERE WOMAN, AS
FAR AS I CAN EXPERIENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: First, there are sincere people in every religion, but groping in
the dark. So if you meet in the Catholic Church sincere seekers, it is
your duty to bring them out of the Catholic Church, because there they
are not going to find what they are seeking. A seeker cannot seek if he
is surrounded by dogma, by a certain attitude about reality -- and that
too, two thousand years old, out of date, out of existence. Those
Catholic Churches are just graveyards. Those people may be seekers and
sincere. Tell them, "You are searching in a graveyard. Come where life
is. Come where dance is. Come where the fresh wind is blowing. In this
stale, closed Catholic Church, you are going to get suffocated and die,
you are not going to find it."</p><p>Because they are sincere, that's why you have to be sincere with them
too. They need respect -- but not only respect; they also need a shock
so that they can wake up and come out of the boundaries of Catholicism,
or Protestantism or Hinduism or Mohammedanism -- that doesn't matter. My
work here is to bring everybody out of his prison; what the name of the
prison is does not matter.</p><p>The person who wants to know the truth has to be completely
deprogrammed. He should not have any belief, he should not have any
religion, he should not have any nation, he should not have any race, he
should be just a simple human being. From there, with that innocence,
like a child, he has to start.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT SEEMS, BHAGWAN, WHEN YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER -- WHEN YOU ARE A
COMPLETE OUTSIDER -- IT SEEMS THAT RAJNEESHISM ALSO IS A PRISON. I WENT
INTO IT A LITTLE BIT AND I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. BUT HOW CAN
YOU MAKE CLEAR TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS IS IN FACT AN ANTI-CHURCH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just wait, let me first finish your question completely. I cannot
leave Mother Teresa alone. So whenever Mother Teresa comes in, please
don't change the subject.</p><p>You say she is a beautiful woman. I have no disagreement about it.
But what she said to you is not beautiful -- that you follow your path,
I follow my path. This is not compassion. If I see you following on a
wrong path I will try every effort to obstruct you from going there, and
I will try to convince you that what you are doing is wrong. That is
compassion.</p><p>And all the paths are not right. There are three hundred religions in
the world. All three hundred religions are not right. This is nice to
say that you follow your path, I follow my path and everybody follows
his path, but that means Mother Teresa does not know at all what is
right. This can be said only by an ignorant person. If I know what is
right, I also know what is wrong, and I will make every effort to
prevent you if you move on the wrong path. To me that will be
compassion. You got influenced by the old woman.…</p><p>Q: I THINK SO, A BIT.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:... But things are not as they appear. She goes on converting
orphans into the Catholic Church. The orphan may be a Mohammedan, may be
a Hindu, may be a Jaina, may be a Buddhist. She does not think those
orphans should follow their path. Just because she has been feeding
them, she has purchased them for the Catholic Church. She wants more and
more orphans, she wants more and more poverty, because without poverty
and without orphans, the number of Catholics cannot increase.</p><p>It is power politics, the politics of numbers. And when you look deep
down into the whole thing, you will not say that she is a beautiful
woman. She is a politician and her answer was diplomatic. It consoled
you, that you go on your path, I go on my path. It gave you certain
strength, but that strength is going to be given to your ego. I cannot
say, "You go on your path." You don't know what your path is, where you
are going. I know there is only one path, there are not many paths.</p><p>So the man of compassion will try in every way to persuade you, to
convince you; rationally he will make the effort. And if there is a
possibility of an open heart, he will make a heart to heart contact too.
When somebody is drowning and you are standing on the bank of the river,
you don't say, "You go on your path and I am going on my path." Do you
think that is beautiful? You have to jump and save that man who is
drowning.</p><p>And now Catholics need to be saved. Jesus started saving people,
although he could not save himself; and for two thousand years these
people are trying to save people. They have not been able to save
anybody. On the contrary, they have been fighting crusades, burning
people alive. These are the saviors of man. And if Mother Teresa has any
intelligence left -- I suspect not, but if she has any intelligence
left, the first thing would be to get out of the Catholic Church.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND BECOME A SANNYASIN.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. Because I can say on my own authority that I can save
her. She cannot say on her own authority anything. She can quote the
dead Bible, she can quote Jesus Christ. I am not quoting anybody. I am
saying it myself.</p><p>Q: AND YOUR PATH IS OBJECTIVE?</p><p>A: Absolutely objective.</p><p>Q:AND ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWS YOUR PATH FINDS THIS TRUTH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAY I PASS TO ANOTHER QUESTION?</p><p>A: Is Mother Teresa finished...? Pass on.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: READING YOUR DISCOURSES, BHAGWAN, ONE MEETS WITH CONTRADICTIONS
CONSTANTLY. I DID NOT STUDY ALL YOUR BOOKS OF COURSE, BUT BASING MYSELF
ON THE ONES I DID READ, I THINK THERE ARE NOT MANY STATEMENTS OF YOURS
WHICH ARE NOT COUNTERED BY OTHER STATMENTS. AM I RIGHT THAT YOU
CONSTANTLY UNDERMINE YOUR OWN TEACHINGS? WHAT IS THE UNCHANGING NUCLEUS
IN YOUR VISION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You are right. I am a man of contradictions; and my understanding
is that only idiots are consistent. The higher your intelligence, the
more contradictions will be in your life, because you are constantly
growing, expanding. Every day new facts arise in your consciousness, and
then the question arises to go with the reality that has been revealed
today or just to remain consistent with your past, dead statements.</p><p>I am not such a coward as your philosophers and theologians are. I
don't bother about anything that I have said, ever. My whole concern is
this moment. If it contradicts my whole life, it is perfectly okay,
there is no harm, it is good. And I am not saying that I will remain
tomorrow with the same statement. Tomorrow will bring its own light,
tomorrow will bring its own experience, and only tomorrow will decide
what statement I am going to make.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IS THERE AN UNCHANGEABLE NUCLEUS, THEN, IN YOUR VISION?</p><p>A: Yes, my consciousness, my awareness. But that you cannot find in
the books. That you can find only in yourself.</p><p>I am absolutely alert. Whatsoever I am saying, I am not saying
according to some dogma, according to my own philosophy up to this
moment. No, I am simply responding to this moment, to you. And I don't
care about anything else for the moment. I am a man who lives moment to
moment. And whatsoever happens in the moment, I am available to it.</p><p>Q: AM I WRONG WHEN I SAY, WHEN I TRY TO DESCRIBE YOUR NUCLEUS, THE
NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION, AS CELEBRATING LIFE?</p><p>A: No, that is just a by-product. The nucleus is consciousness,
absolute consciousness. Out of it many things will be there: celebration
of life, love, laughter. Out of it so many branches and so many
flowers... but the nucleus remains consciousness. And that I have never
contradicted in my whole life. I cannot, because whatsoever I have said,
I have said with full consciousness. But that was in that moment.</p><p>For example, I may fall in love with a woman, and in that moment I
may say to the woman that I will love her forever. And I am not
cheating, I am not deceiving; that's my response in that moment, and I
am absolutely clear about it. But that does not mean that tomorrow I
will not change. I am not saying that I will never change; I am simply
stating my response to the moment. The next moment nobody knows what
will happen, and the next moment I will not find myself chained by my
own past.</p><p>So my approach is to go on dying to the past moment continuously so
that you can be alive in the new moment that is coming. Death to the
past, life to the present. And the future is going to come to you as
present, never as past.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT MEANS, I THINK, TRY TO LIVE WITHOUT TRADITION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly.</p><p>Q: AND NOW MY QUESTION IS: THIS IDEA THAT YOU TRIED TO DESCRIBE OF
LIVING OUT OF THE FULLNESS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND IN THIS MOMENT,
HERE AND NOW -- IS THIS IDEA NOT ALSO A PRODUCT OF TRADITION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, because nobody has said it before. No tradition exists around
this idea. Buddha was very consistent. Forty-two years' teaching... you
cannot find a single contradiction. In Buddha, Mohammed, you cannot find
any contradiction. In Jesus you cannot find any contradiction either.
These people lived according to a certain dogma. They were
prisoners.</p><p>I am a free bird with no cage around me. And I want to break all the
cages of everybody, so the whole sky is yours. Sometimes it is sunrise,
sometimes it is sunset. Sometimes it is day and sometimes it is night.
Things go on changing in existence, and a man of consciousness remains
in harmony with existence, with the continuous flux of existence. My
statements in the past are as dead as I am to the past.</p><p>Q: BUT WE ARE ALL STILL READING THE BOOKS YOU SPOKE IN THE PAST. IS
THAT SENSELESS THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is significant. But don't trust those books against my present.
Perhaps reading them you may be able to understand what I am saying now.
All those contradictions and all those books will help you to understand
my present state and my present statement about existence. That is their
only use. If you can understand it without them, burn them. There is no
need of all those books.</p><p>I have never read any of my books, and I am not ever going to look at
them -- because past is past, gone is gone, and I don't live in a
graveyard. Only dead people can be consistent, because they cannot
contradict anymore. I am alive, and I am going to be alive to the very
last breath of my life. My last breath will also be a statement, perhaps
contradicting all that I have done and said before, so wait.</p><p>Q: SO, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE THAT AT THE END YOU WOULD SAY, THE VERY
NOTION OF ENLIGHTENMENT -- FORGET IT!</p><p><br></p><p>A: I can. I can say anything, I am so free. Don't you see the beauty
of freedom? You can say anything, you can live anything. There is no
bondage on me. At the last moment I can say, "All this business of
enlightenment is simply bullshit. Forget all about it" -- and perhaps a
few people may get enlightened only when I say that.</p><p>Nobody can make a dogma out of me; nobody can be a pope after me,
because he will be in so much trouble. Nobody can be a successor to me
because he will not be able to manage all the contradictions, thousands
of contradictions.</p><p>Q: SO THE ONLY NUCLEUS IN YOUR VISION IS BHAGWAN HIMSELF</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. I am the center of my circus and when I am gone, who
bothers what happens to the circus?</p><p>Q: YOU SAID JUST A MOMENT AGO, "I WANT TO SHOCK PEOPLE AWAKE." AND I
HAVE THE FEELING THAT VERY OFTEN YOU SHOCK WITH SUCH A HEAVINESS THAT
YOU PROVOKE A LOT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST YOURSELF, AGAINST YOUR
SANNYASINS. IS THIS PRICE WORTHWHILE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is absolutely necessary -- no question of its worthwhileness. I
want their hostility, I want their aggressiveness, because their
hostility and their aggressiveness is going to work in two ways. If my
sannyasins are simply ignored, nobody takes any offense, that simply
means I have nothing to offer to the world, no contribution, nothing
new. It can be ignored. The only thing that I</p><p>hate is to be ignored. Be aggressive -- that I accept, because at
least a certain relationship has started happening between me and the
person who is aggressive.</p><p>Hostility is emotional and the beauty of the whole game is that the
hostile person is burning himself. I am not hostile; I have simply
triggered something in him and he is burning himself.</p><p>And nobody can remain hostile for long. It is a sickness. He has to
find some way out of it. Either he has to forget all about me -- which
is impossible because I have hurt him so deeply.… Neither can he forgive
me nor forget me -- the only possible way is to come close to me and try
to understand what I am doing. "Is it really right for me to be hostile
to these people? Is it right for me to be so full of hate with these
people?" And anybody who comes closer is going to change. This has been
happening every day.</p><p>In Ahmedabad a man came and fell at my feet. I said, "What is the
matter?" He was crying. He pulled out a big knife and he said, "I had
come to kill you because what I have heard about you, that you are
destroying the whole tradition of Hinduism, made me so angry, but when I
heard you something suddenly changed in me. I could see that you are not
interested in destroying any tradition. You are simply interested in
helping people to find the truth, and if something has to be demolished
on the way, removed from the way so the person can reach to the truth,
you are doing that." And he wanted to be initiated into sannyas.</p><p>Hate can very easily turn into love, just as love can turn into hate.
They are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>So it is with full awareness that I am continuously creating enemies
around the world. I don't want anybody to go on sleeping without being
disturbed. Perhaps a few of them may wake up. Most of them will take a
turn, pull over their blanket and go to sleep again, but that is not my
responsibility. If out of a hundred even one person wakes up and sees
what has happened, that my hit over his head was not against him but was
against his sleep, he will be grateful to me. Those who are hostile to
me can be grateful to me if they wake up. If they don't wake up, they
are already asleep, let them sleep.</p><p>And what harm can anybody do to me? At the most they can kill me --
that is nothing, because I have known everything that can be known and I
have experienced everything that can be experienced. Now I am almost
living a posthumous life. As far as I am concerned, I have come to the
point beyond which there is nothing. And I am so.blissful that if
somebody wants to assassinate me I don't see any harm in it.</p><p>People are afraid of death because they have not lived yet and death
is coming closer. I have lived, I have tasted the nectar of life. Now
there is no problem for me, so I can create as much hostility as
possible in the hope that perhaps a few, out of thousands, may wake up.
And they are waking up.</p><p>Q: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD AS "MENTAL
HEALTH" IN SOCIETY... WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SLEEP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The society that exists today is retarded. Its mental age is below
thirteen. It is worse than asleep. What do you expect of a
seventy-year-old man, carrying a small intelligence of a
thirteen-year-old boy? The distance between his intelligence and his
life is so big.</p><p>This is sleep. The awakened person moves together almost as an
organic unity. With his physical age, his mental age goes on growing.
With his mental age, his spiritual awareness goes on growing. If a
person really goes on growing simultaneously on all levels of life, then
only you have a perfect Master someday. Otherwise, the so-called masters
are masters just for those retarded people; the so-called saints, saints
only for the retarded. And nobody wants -- your politicians, your
priests -- nobody wants man to be intelligent because it is against
their vested interests.</p><p>An intelligent man cannot be Catholic, an intelligent man cannot
believe in the boundaries of nations, an intelligent man cannot conceive
that white and black colors make any difference. An intelligent man will
have a totally different vision of life.</p><p>These vested interests cannot allow this earth to become awake.
Before it wakes up, they are ready with all their nuclear weapons to
destroy it. It is such a calamity. To me, the destruction of life is not
the real problem. The real problem is that man is now at a point where
thousands of people can become enlightened, and the politicians are
preparing to destroy this whole living beautiful earth.</p><p>Q: YOU MEAN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF SANNYASINS, THESE THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE ENLIGHTENED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There are many who are not even sannyasins... they can be
awakened. Man has gained a certain maturity. Sannyasins certainly, but
there are many who are</p><p>potential sannyasins, like you; I can see you in the orange robe any
day. It all depends on your courage. But I can see a man of intelligence
in front of me, who can understand, and he would like to have his
consciousness blossom to its fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YES, BHAGWAN, BUT IT WOULD BE, FOR ME, A BLIND GAMBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Every search is a blind gamble. Those who are afraid of blind
gambles remain stuck and starve, they never grow. One has to take the
risk. One has to stake everything. And as far as I have known, anybody
who has taken the risk has never been a loser.</p><p>I don't play the game of being a loser in any way. And if I tell my
people to stake everything, I can say it with certainty, categorically,
because I know that if they can stake and risk, they will be reborn.</p><p>There is an old story. A man was traveling and got lost in the night,
in the mountains. He was really very much afraid, alone. The place was
unknown, the road was lost, there was no light. As far as he could see,
there was no village, no lamp. But still he tried to find his way, and
then he slipped from a rock. Holding the roots of a tree, he was
hanging.</p><p>The night was becoming colder and colder and he knew that soon he
would not be able to keep a grip on the roots; the hands were becoming
frozen. His death was near. He looked, and by the side, there was
abysmal darkness. He knew there was a big valley by the side of the
mountain and there was no chance of surviving.</p><p>Finally, his hands started slipping. There was no way to prevent it.
But he was in for a great surprise. When the hands slipped and he
thought, "This is my last moment," and he prayed to his god in whom he
believed, the roots slipped out of his hand and he was standing on the
ground. There was nothing, and the whole night he had suffered. And it
was getting to be sunrise and he could see that this was strange, he was
standing on the road!</p><p>Risk is there, but I know the path. I know that if you are ready to
lose your grip, you will be immediately on the clear ground, on the way;
you are not going to lose anything. This is the whole function of the
Master. The function of the Master is not to give you beliefs, is not to
give you philosophy. His function is to give you confidence in yourself,
to make you a gambler from a businessman.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHEN I GET AROUND YOUR SANNYASINS -- I GET ALONG VERY
WELL WITH THEM, IT'S PLEASANT TO BE WITH THEM -- BUT I VERY OFTEN FEEL
THAT THEY FOLLOW YOU BLINDLY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I AM WRONG OR RIGHT
BUT I VERY OFTEN GET THIS FEELING. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PRODUCE TEST-TUBE BABIES. NOW I'M SURE, IN SOME
DAYS, ALL YOUR SANNYASINS KNOW THIS IDEA OF YOURS AND THEY AGREE WITH
YOU. NOW, IN TWO WEEKS YOU SAY SOMETHING OPPOSITE -- ALL YOUR SANNYASINS
AGREE WITH YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That means they are also growing with me. That does not make any
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WHERE IS THEN THE DOUBT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF? I
CANNOT, EVEN IF I WOULD LOVE YOU DEEPLY, I COULD NOT FOLLOW YOUR
OPINIONS EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY YOU CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS, DON'T YOU?</p><p>A: That means you are not growing with me, you are lagging far
behind. My sannyasins are my fellow travelers. Sometimes I walk fast,
they have to walk fast. Sometimes I dance, they have to dance. Sometimes
I just relax and they have to relax. They are just my fellow travelers.
There is no philosophy, no belief, no faith. They are love, pure love
towards me, just the way I am pure love towards them. It is a love
affair.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO HAVE A LOVE AFFAIR.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nobody decides. I am simply love. I never fall in love. I am in
it, I am it. Others go on falling in love with me. But they don't lose
anything; the moment they fall in love with me, they have discovered
their life's juiciest moment. They could not have even dreamed about it.
Your question is very relevant.</p><p>In the beginning, a sannyasin is baffled, confused that I said one
thing yesterday and I am saying another thing today. Now what am I
supposed to do? In the beginning, it happens to every sannyasin. Soon he
starts understanding that what I say is not the point. Somewhere between
my statements there is a gap. Between my words there is a gap. Between
my lines there is a gap. That is my real statement.</p><p>Soon they start learning it, then they don't care what I said
yesterday and what I said today. They don't compare. The gap is the
same, the words have changed. The lines are different but between the
lines The moment they start seeing me</p><p>between the lines, between the statements, all their trouble
disappears. And it is not belief</p><p>Q: THERE IS OBJECTIVITY BETWEEN THOSE LINES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAY I ASK QUITE ANOTHER QUESTION? ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IN THE
NETHERLANDS ALSO, WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH YOUR ROLLS ROYCES, OF
COURSE, AND I DECIDED I HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS.</p><p>A: You ask anything you want.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THAT I, MYSELF, AM THE HAPPY OWNER OF A
CAR OF THE JAPANESE MAKE, TOYOTA COROLLA. NOW, I WOULD RATHER HAVE TWO
OF THEM, SO I WOULD HAVE ONE IN RESERVE BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT TO
DO WITH THREE TOYOTAS. YOU HAVE, IF I AM RIGHT, SEVENTY-FIVE ROLLS
ROYCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THEY'RE NOT.…</p><p>A: You're not right. One has just arrived -- and I have no problem.
There are ninety Rolls Royces, and I have no problem; and you are having
problems, even with three? Poor guy! And that, too, Toyotas, a
third-rate car... just a toy. And just with three you are.…</p><p>And I am soon going to have 365, and still there will be no problem.
I don't see any problem. I never go to the garage. I don't even know
what car they are going to give me today. My people are there and they
are intelligent enough, they can take care of anything. If they can take
care of ninety Rolls Royces, they will be able to take care of 365. This
is their problem, not mine. And I don't think they are troubled
either... they look so happy. A new car arrives and they are
rejoicing.</p><p>There is no problem in having two or three cars. The problem is
somewhere else which, out of respect, you are not asking me.</p><p>Q: WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. It is not the number. Your question is not Rolls Royces but
Ethiopia, India, poor countries, poor people around the world. I am
making it clear to you, because I can see it is there within you. A
Rolls Royce is just to bring the question out, but you love me so you
cannot ask directly. You are going around about... there is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MAY I PHRASE THIS QUESTION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's what I was doing. You can phrase. I was phrasing your
question.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MY QUESTION, WHICH I HAD WRITTEN DOWN FOR THIS, IS WHY, IN YOUR
VISION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL GROWTH AND AT THE
SAME TIME HELP YOUR NEIGHBOR? WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A SANNYASIN AND
AT THE SAME TIME HELP ETHIOPIA?</p><p>A: Nobody is preventing anybody. I am not saying to my sannyasins,
"Don't help the neighbor." I am telling them, "Help them!" And the only
way to help them is to hit them. They are asleep, they have to be
awakened first. Any other help will be coming later on. Set their houses
on fire so they have to wake up and escape out, then we will catch hold
of them.</p><p>I'm not preventing my people from helping, but again the same
problem. Because you love me, you cannot say it directly -- I have to
phrase it for you.</p><p>Q: PLEASE DO.</p><p>A: You want that the poor should be given bread, butter, clothes,
shelter, that there are sick people who need hospitals, that there are
beggars in the world... something has to be done for them, and this
should be my sannyasins' responsibility.</p><p>I don't consider it my sannyasins' responsibility. If there are poor
people in the world, the priests and the politicians, and the scientists
and the educationalists all are guilty of it. They have created a world
which has to be poor and they exploit the poverty in many ways. For
example, this beautiful woman, Mother Teresa. I don't think her face
looks beautiful, but tastes differ. Your taste is a little strange.
Would you like to get married to her? -- then you will know how
beautiful she is.</p><p>These people who have been serving the poor, catering to the poor,
are helping the poor to remain poor. Otherwise, the poor either would
have died out of poverty or would have gone through a great revolution
and changed the whole society. Only two things are possible if no help
is given to them. I want no help to be given to these people; they
should take their own responsibility. If they are poor and they don't
want to go through a revolution, change the whole structure of the
society, destroy the whole status quo, throw these governments away...
and if you cannot do that, then at least you can die. Don't
unnecessarily be a nuisance around.</p><p>For example, in Ethiopia where thousands of people are dying every
day, the priests and the bishops and the popes and politicians are all
just sympathy for Ethiopia. And they are trying to send food, medicine,
but their whole effort is very hypocritical. On the one hand they want
to save the poor in Ethiopia, on the other hand they are piling up
nuclear weapons. For whom? They are not lifeloving people, they are
showing sympathy to Ethiopia just as part of diplomacy. It has nothing
to do with service to humanity, because their small support that they
are sending is not going to help, it has not helped. It is almost like
dropping a teaspoon full of sugar in the ocean to make it sweet. Great
responsibility you are fulfilling: you destroyed one cup of tea!</p><p>I am not in favor of sending any help to Ethiopia. Only one thing is
possible: if these big dodos around the world, presidents and prime
ministers and kings and queens, if they are really concerned with
Ethiopia, then there are two alternatives for them. Stop piling up
weapons and divert the whole money and energy towards Ethiopia, and
Ethiopia will be saved today.</p><p>Or, if you cannot do that, then at least do one thing: send your
medical people to inject these people with something that takes them
into eternal sleep. It is better to die than to starve for ninety days
and then die. It is compassionate. And there is no harm if there is no
Ethiopia... what harm?</p><p>Q: SO, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU WELL, BHAGWAN, YOU SAY THAT THE MISERY IN
ETHIOPIA IS VERY REAL.</p><p>A: Mm hmm.</p><p>Q:... AND THIS REMINDS ME OF ONE OF YOUR DISCOURSES IN WHICH YOU
SAID, "YOUR MISERY IS BOGUS." AND THIS AT THE TIME MADE RATHER AN
IMPRESSION ON ME, AND I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT MY PERSONAL MISERY IS
BOGUS INDEED.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Mm hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THEN I WONDERED, IS THE MISERY OF THIS ETHIOPIAN MOTHER,
SEEING HER CHILD DYING OF STARVATION, BOGUS ALSO?</p><p>A: It is a totally different context. When I said your misery is your
responsibility, I meant your anxieties, your anguishes, your
expectations, your frustrations, your aspirations, your ambitions which
are not going to be fulfilled. I meant your mental anguish. That
statement was in a totally different context.</p><p>But in Ethiopia, it is not that the mother is imagining that her
child is dying. He is really dying. The child is not imagining that the
mother is dying; the mother is really dying and soon she will be
dead.</p><p>And fortunately in Ethiopia there are not Christian Scientists. There
has been a movement in America of Christian Science. Christian Science
has as one of its fundamentals that whatsoever you think becomes sooner
or later a reality. Thoughts are the beginning of a certain reality.</p><p>I have heard the story that a young boy met an old Christian
Scientist lady. The lady asked the boy, "I have not seen your father for
many days. Is he not coming to the meetings of our group?" The boy
said,"He's sick. He's in his bed." The old woman said, "Nonsense. This
is just mind. You just tell your father that he is only thinking he is
sick:'Just think you are healthy. Think positively that you are healthy.
Get out of your bed, be positive.' Don't fall into negativity -- this is
our whole philosophy: positive thinking."</p><p>After three or four days, the boy meets the old woman again in the
market and the old woman says, "What happened? Did you manage to convey
the message to your father?" He said, "Now my father thinks he's dead.
And not only my father -- everybody thinks he is no more in the house,
he is in his grave!"</p><p>The misery in Ethiopia is real, objectively real, and these
sympathies are not going to help. They are simply keeping people
starving, dying. And it is better to die instantly rather than to wait
and suffer all kinds of torture that this hungry man is bound to
suffer.</p><p>And this is a thing to be understood, that a normally healthy man can
live without food for ninety days, then he will die. Now, making these
people suffer for ninety days does not seem to be compassionate. To me
it is more compassionate that they are given injections so they go into
eternal sleep. And</p><p>anyway the soul does not die, so what is the problem? All these
religions believe that the soul does not die, so what is the
problem?</p><p>Communists believe that when you die, everything dies. Then, too,
there is no problem. I don't see a problem from any side. And if
Ethiopia is not there, who bothers? What has Ethiopia contributed to the
world?</p><p>Q: DO I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, THAT YOU SAY NOBODY SHOULD DO
ANYTHING ABOUT ETHIOPIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am saying either do -- that means stop piling nuclear weapons,
that is my first alternative. If you are really sympathetic towards
dying people, then why are you creating weapons for death? That is
simple hypocrisy. Stop! If you are really concerned with dying people,
then whatsoever is happening in Ethiopia is nothing to what has happened
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>Those few moments, the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have suffered
as much as one can suffer in the Christian hell. And you have now seven
hundred times more nuclear weapons than there were available at the time
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And they go on piling up.</p><p>On the one hand, seventy-five percent of the income of every country
goes to war; and on the other hand, these politicians really have
beautiful masks. And they must be having many because they have to
change again and again. When Ethiopia is there and people are dying, you
are so sympathetic and you want to save Ethiopia. These two things don't
go together, they are inconsistent.</p><p>So my first alternative is that the nations should stop creating more
war, and the poverty not only from Ethiopia but from the whole world
will disappear today. The poverty is there because our whole energy is
involved with war, with the preparation for war.</p><p>And if you cannot do it, then at least don't be a hypocrite. Be
direct and say, "Let Ethiopia die. We don't care. We are going to make
more nuclear weapons and we are going to have a third world war, and
what does it matter?" The whole world is going to end in the third world
war. Ethiopia will be saved from nuclear weapons, they will die before
that. That's perfectly good. Let them die, but don't be a hypocrite.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, IF PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD DECIDE TO ASK YOU TO BE HIS
ADVISOR, WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM IN REGARD TO THESE NUCLEAR ARMS?</p><p>A: Just tell your scientists to find some creative use for all these
weapons, because you cannot throw them into the Pacific; sooner or later
they will explode just by accident. You cannot throw them into the
Atlantic, you cannot throw them and bury them under the earth. Anytime,
anything can trigger them and they can explode your own country or
somebody else's. But energy is neutral,</p><p>energy is never decisive whether it can destroy or it can create. It
depends on the direction that the human mind gives it.</p><p><br></p><p>If the human mind can create nuclear weapons to destroy, it can
change nuclear power into construction. It can create more electricity,
it can give better rains, it can give better earth. It can do
miracles.</p><p>So much energy is piled up in these two nations, and smaller piles in
smaller nations, that if they all simply think once, "What are we doing?
Our scientists should be together. "</p><p>My advice is that the scientists should not be under any national
regime. There should be a world academy of scientists who can decide how
to convert nuclear weapons and energy into positive things. It is
possible.</p><p>Q: BUT PRACTICALLY, SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DISARM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not saying disarm. Changing nuclear weapons into creativity
does not mean disarm; because you have many more arms than just the
nuclear weapons. You could fight the first world war without weapons,
you could fight the second world war -- you had already won before you
threw the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Germany had already
surrendered and Japan was on the verge of surrendering.</p><p>Atomic and nuclear weapons should be completely converted to serve
humanity. And go back before the first world war: those bombs and those
airplanes are good. Whenever you feel an itch to fight, fight!</p><p>Up to the first world war I allow; then fight. It is perfectly good
once in a while, good exercise. But I am not ready to accept the third
world war. Every effort should be made to prevent it -- and this is a
beautiful chance.</p><p>Ethiopia, India and other countries of the third world are on the
verge; any moment there will be more Ethiopias. It is good we start
transforming that energy into something positive and creative that can
help these people who are dying.</p><p>If you cannot do it -- remember my condition -- if you cannot do it,
then don't unnecessarily try to pretend that you are Christians and
Catholics and Protestants, and you are sending money and you are sending
blankets, and you are sending clothes and food. It is not going to help,
it has never helped before. This has been happening again and again
through history. Just be very clear and send medical teams so all
Ethiopians in one night go into eternal sleep. At least they will not be
hungry tomorrow morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YES.</p><p><br></p><p>A: And you will be at ease, Ethiopia will not be a troublesome
problem for you. So I am giving two alternatives. And remember my first
priority is to stop</p><p>nuclear weapons piling up more and more, and divert the whole money
that you are wasting on nuclear weapons.</p><p>My second alternative is: if that is not possible, then just simply
accept the fact that we cannot save Ethiopia, but we can at least help
them to die peacefully. We cannot help them to live peacefully, at least
we can help them to die peacefully. And that will be really great
compassion on the part of politicians. Rather than leaving them
starving, dying, getting tortured by hunger. For four years there</p><p>have been no rains. Water has become almost impossible to get. Not
only food is not available, water is not available.</p><p>And it is only in one country right now, but soon India will be
joining it, because half of the Indian continent is starving. And you
will be surprised to know that the Indian prime minister is selling
wheat to other countries. Fifty percent of his own nation is starving
and the wheat is being sold because he wants a nuclear plant in India.
Can you see the stupidity of this whole thing?</p><p>Q: MAY I CHANGE TO A SUBJECT WITH A BIT MORE FUN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You can change.</p><p>Q: IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, YOU DESCRIBED YOUR COMMUNE AS A CIRCUS
AND YOURSELF AS A GREAT SHOWMAN, THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. WERE YOU
MOCKING YOURSELF AND YOUR COMMUNE? WHY DID YOU SAY IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Again, you are bringing the past here. Forget all about that
nonsense. I am a showman? And my people a circus? I contradict it
completely.</p><p>Q: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes... there is no circus here. This is the only place where a
circus is not happening.</p><p>Q: AND YOU ARE A SERIOUS TEACHER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am a very non-serious teacher! And I have already forgotten
about what news conference you are talking! I just respond to you. Why
drag the dead unnecessarily out of their graves? Let them sleep
silently. You are alive, I am alive, we can have an existential
encounter.</p><p>And I see the potentiality in you, that's why I am saying that. I
would not have said it to another person. I have been interviewed every
night, every evening -- and now this is going to be continuous -- but I
would not have said that to another journalist. I don't see you just as
a journalist, I see you more as a seeker. I see you more as a human
being. And I see your heart throbbing with me, in tune</p><p>with me, that's why I am saying it. Otherwise, I can go on answering
about the past, anything that comes to my mind, there is no problem
about it.</p><p>I love jokes. And to joke on other people's account is not very good,
not nice. So, once in a while, I joke upon myself, upon my people. And
it was simply a joke, and those idiotic newspaper journalists thought it
is something serious. Do you think a showman will sit here in the
desert? Is this the place for a showman? Then I would have chosen
Hollywood. On the contrary, I have pulled all my Hollywood people
here.</p><p>In this desert, 126 square miles, I am sitting the whole day in my
room. I only come out twice: in the morning to talk with the sannyasins,
in the evening to talk with any interviewer. What kind of a showman do
you think I am? This is not the way of being a showman.</p><p>The showman has to be always running -- like Mother Teresa. She is in
New York, she is in Chicago, she is in Washington, she is receiving a
Nobel prize in Norway, she is in India, Calcutta. I wonder when she gets
the time to serve the poor people. All the time she is moving around the
world, becoming a bigger and bigger celebrity. The more she is becoming
senile, the bigger a celebrity she is becoming. And when does she serve
the poor people? She is inaugurating colleges, schools, hospitals.…</p><p>I don't have any time for showmanship. I will tell you my routine and
you will see: from where can I get the time? Six o'clock in the morning,
I wake up. That too, my caretaker, Vivek, has to wake me up, otherwise I
will not wake up. Who cares to wake up again? I have been waking for
half a century again and again. It is enough.</p><p>But she wakes me up, gives me a cup of tea. Just to be respectful to
her, I drink the tea. My tea is not much, it is just water and tea
leaves. No sugar, no milk. If that kind of tea is served in heaven, all
the saints will start moving towards hell. Then -- I have always loved
water, from my very childhood -- one and a half hours in the morning I
am in my bathroom, enjoying the bathtub, the shower; and the same in the
evening, one and a half hours again.</p><p>After my bath, immediately I have to get into the car and move to the
Mandir where my people are waiting. Back to my place, it is lunchtime. I
take my lunch at eleven, and go to sleep again, which I have done most
of my life. I had to miss my classes when I was a student, and my
teachers allowed it because if they did not allow, then I used to sleep
in the class. I said, "There is no way... I have to sleep these two
hours."</p><p>When I was a professor, I was sleeping two hours and I had told the
vice- chancellor that during these two hours no classes should be given
to me; otherwise I would be sleeping there.</p><p>At two o'clock I wake up, and for one hour I go for a ride. That is
the only time I come in contact with the Rolls Royces. I love driving,
and I have certainly one of the most beautiful roads, because it is made
by my sannyasins only for me. There</p><p>is no traffic, so I need not bother whether I am driving on the right
or on the left. The whole road belongs to me. One hour there and back
home.</p><p>One and a half hours I simply sit silently in my chair doing nothing
and let the grass grow by itself Then my bath.</p><p>After the bath, I take my supper; and after the supper, I am here. I
will be back there nearabout nine, nine-thirty. Then comes my personal
secretary -- with letters from all over the world; news cuttings about
me from all over the world, anything that the personal secretary feels I
need to know -- because I don't read. Since five years I have stopped
reading anything: books, newspapers, magazines, anything.</p><p>The clippings that my personal secretary brings she has to read; I
simply listen. Nearabout eleven, I go to bed again. Now, where will I
find the time to be a showman? Yes, you can look at my dress and think
it looks like the dress of a showman. It is not, it is the love of my
people. I am dressing for them. They make beautiful dresses, they enjoy
making them for me. I cannot refuse them. And to whom am I going to
show? I never go out of this place.</p><p>You see my watch? I have hundreds. My people are really intelligent
people -- no Master in the whole history can claim such an intelligent
group. Now, this is made by my sannyasins. It has already defeated
Piaget -- and it is made of real stones, not diamonds.</p><p>Q: REAL STONES?</p><p>A: Real stones, not diamonds. So don't carry the idea that it is a
fake watch. Real stones are as real as real diamonds, there is no
question of its being fake.</p><p>I just heard on television one stupid journalist saying that I have
been using fake watches. I cannot understand: so authentic stones, and
you call it a fake watch? Its time is absolutely perfect; in a year only
one second will be the difference, and that is the best any watch can
do. It is as beautiful as any diamond. The same watch from Piaget is a
half million dollars, just because of an idiotic idea that diamonds have
some value. This watch costs nothing, but I will not sell it even for
ten million dollars because it is invaluable. It is made with such great
love that it is not a saleable thing. Love cannot be sold. But to whom
am I going to show the watch? My people know my dresses, my people know
my watches, my people know me. I don't mix with anybody else, I don't go
anywhere else. As far as I am concerned, the third world war has
happened, and only Rajneeshpuram is saved. There is nowhere else to
go.</p><p>I was simply joking. And my people are working hard, twelve hours,
fourteen hours a day, transforming a desert into an oasis -- and do you
think these people constitute a circus?</p><p>You will not find anywhere in the world such hardworking people, and
they are not being paid, because we don't believe in any way inside the
commune that money should be used. There is no need. We fulfill our
needs, our food, our</p><p>clothes, everything, so nobody needs any money. Whatsoever he needs,
he can get.</p><p>These people are working so hard, and for what? To entertain
somebody? These people are creative people. They love me and now they
want to materialize my vision into reality. And they are ready to do
anything for it. In festival times, they are working fourteen, sixteen
hours a day with no complaint. Nobody is telling them or forcing
them.</p><p>Q: YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Not at all. I never talk to them about these things. I never
talk about the commune, about any mundane things. They are intelligent
enough that they can manage themselves. And they are doing so well that
it cannot be improved.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT WAS THEIR IDEA, IT WAS NOT YOUR IDEA, THIS COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is my vision, and their love for my vision, but the idea to
materialize it is theirs. I am a dreamer: I can give you beautiful
dreams, and I give for free -- I don't charge for them. But then if you
get caught up in the dream and you start trying to materialize it, that
is your responsibility. I simply watch from the outside.</p><p>It is not a circus. The Vatican may be a circus, and with Pope the
Polack it is bound to be a circus. Nothing more can be expected of this
thick head. I was just joking, laughing. And our people were there in
the press conference and they enjoyed. You should listen to the video of
the press conference, then you will see how much our people enjoyed and
how silly the journalists looked. They could not manage to ask any
significant question.</p><p>But you need not bother about those people. You have a certain
acquaintance with me, so I know these answers will be enough for you. If
you want to add something, you can add -- I give you the authority. I
love you and I trust you. I know you cannot do anything that will be
against me.</p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-18>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 29.]</p><p>Mike Wolfe KBND RADIO BEND OREGON</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, MY NAME IS MIKE WOLFE. I'VE BEEN IN THE RADIO AND
TELEVISION BUSINESS -- IN WASHINGTON D.C., DENVER, COLORADO -- SO I'VE
TRAVELED A BIT AND GOT TIRED OF THE BIG CITIES AND CAME TO CENTRAL
OREGON. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS INTERESTING TO ME, AND WILL
ALWAYS MAKE ME REMEMBER YOU, IS THAT I HAVE A SIX-AND-A-HALF-YEAR OLD
SON WHO WAS ALSO BORN ON DECEMBER 11TH. SO I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER
BHAGWAN'S BIRTHDAY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's great!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME YEAR, HOWEVER.</p><p>THE HOSPITALITY, I MUST SAY, IN THE BEGINNING HERE THAT WE HAVE
RECEIVED.… AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING, THERE IS OF COURSE
CONTROVERSY, MAYBE MISREPRESENTED CONTROVERSY, THAT RAJNEESHPURAM IS AN
ARMED CAMP. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT; THAT THE PEOPLE ARE COLD AND
DISINTERESTED IN THOSE OF US WHO LIVE OUTSIDE -- AND I HAVE NOT SEEN
THAT. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT I HAVE NOT FELT IN MANY ROOMS IN MY
LIFE AS MUCH LOVE AS THERE IS IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. AND I DON'T THINK
PEOPLE MAY REALIZE THAT.</p><p>I WANT TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE CITY OF RAJNEESHPURAM WHICH I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW AND VISIT IN A VERY QUICK WAY TODAY, AND ASK IF THIS
DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THAT MAYBE THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS NOT AS FAMILIAR
WITH AS I NOW BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE, COULD IN YOUR MIND DEVELOP INTO A
PROTOTYPE OF WHAT CITIES POSSIBLY COULD AND SHOULD BE?</p><p>A: Yes, that's exactly my idea. This loving commune should become a
prototype, because in the vast world, even though you are in the crowd,
you are alone. Here, even if you are alone, you know and you feel the
warmth of people all around you.</p><p>Love is something which is nobody's monopoly. A loving person is
simply a love-radiating energy. And when there are thousands of people
radiating love, there is a certain energy field. I called it the
Buddhafield. Anybody who comes will receive the love, the friendship,
the hospitality... but people are afraid to come.</p><p>Q: WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For the simple reason that we are strangers. This is animal
instinct. Animals are afraid of strangers. Every animal has its own
territorial prerogative. If you keep out of the territory he will not
get disturbed or upset, but if you enter into his territory, then
immediately he is hostile. That instinct is still alive in man.</p><p>We are outsiders. In many ways our ways of thinking are different,
our values are different, our priorities are different. We are for a
better man and for a better humanity, and their fear and hostility is
natural.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE THE HOSTILITIES CREATED OR PERPETRATED BY THE LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING AND THE ABSENCE, AS IT WOULD APPEAR TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
OF A WILLINGNESS FOR THE RAJNEESHEES TO GO OUT, RATHER THAN ACCEPT IN,
SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. This is my basic standpoint: not to go out, because that is
interfering into somebody's world. I am not a missionary and I hate the
word. I don't want anybody to be converted, and I don't want anybody to
be convinced that we are right. In fact the people who try to convince
others that they are right are basically, deep down in themselves, not
convinced that they are right. Convincing others, they are making an
effort to convince themselves.</p><p>When they see they have a crowd convinced, then they feel at ease.
Then they know, "I cannot be wrong. If so many people are converted by
me, then I cannot be wrong."</p><p>This outgoing is impossible for me or my people. We are here, we do
no harm to anybody, and we don't want to interfere in anybody's
thinking, way of life, his style, his religion, his politics -- we do
not want to interfere. We accept him as he is. But if he wants to be
acquainted with our world, he is welcome.</p><p>Q: BUT TO BE EXPOSED TO YOUR WORLD, TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE EXPOSURE --
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO hate THIS PARTICULAR GROUP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN
THE GROUP, I WOULD IMAGINE, WHO FEEL</p><p>THAT AND REALIZE THAT HATE OUTSIDE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GOES ON HERE -- WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD
IDEA, not AS A MISSIONARY, not REACHING OUT TO CONVERT, BUT IN FACT TO
INFORM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will wait, because if they are hating me and my people, they are
on the way towards Rajneeshpuram. Hate is a relationship, and sometimes
far stronger than love. And once they come here, then we will see.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THIS HATE -- USING THAT WORD, SINCE I
BROUGHT IT UP -- IS BRED BY FEAR, WHICH IS BRED BY SOMETHING UNKNOWN.
THIS IS A MYSTERIOUS WORLD INSIDE THIS VALLEY.</p><p>A: Yes, that is true. That mysteriousness in this valley will attract
only those people who are ready to go on an adventure, who want to
explore, who want to know the unknown -- and those are the only people
who have any worth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT KIND OF WORTH?</p><p>A: They are adventurers -- they are on a pilgrimage to know the
unknown -- they are the real people. Others are just living like
animals, without exploration.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT SELECT GROUP OF RISK-TAKERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. With me, only that select group can have a communion.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT IS... WHAT IS THE FUTURE -- AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THE FUTURE OR ADDRESS YOURSELF TO IT -- BUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE
OFRAJNEESHPURAM? WE GOT OFF THE TRACK A LITTLE BIT. I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY, THE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT
I'VE SEEN TODAY -- AGRICULTURALLY, CERTAINLY THE COMMUNAL WAY OF LIFE.
WHAT DO YOU VIEW AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS VALLEY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE IN THIS TRAVEL WITH YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I'm not concerned with it. My concern is with people and their
growth. The city is their concern, not my concern. And I have so many
intelligent people here, architects, engineers, doctors, professors --
from all the professions, daring, adventurous people have come to me.
Now it is up to them, a mundane affair, I don't care about it. I trust
them, they will be able to manage, and they are managing. And they will
be able to develop it technologically, but it is not my concern at
all.</p><p>Q: WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN?</p><p>A: My concern is their spiritual growth. Their intelligence should
come to its highest peak. They should be deprogrammed from all past,
rotten and dead, meaningless and harmful.… My work is not to create the
city, but to create the man, and then the man will take care of the city
and the houses. That is a totally different matter. I don't bother about
it.</p><p>But my basic concern is the individual. The individual is to me the
highest value in life. And all the religions of the world have repressed
the individual. They have all made him feel guilty, they have all made
him somehow think himself unworthy, a sinner. All the religions, in
different ways, have forced everybody into a corner where he is no more
human. They have humiliated humanity. It was their vested interest.</p><p>They needed a world of slaves, not a world of rebels. And you can
make a person shrink if you make him guilty. You can make him afraid of
hell, you can make him greedy for heaven, and this way you can make him
completely forget this moment, this life. All the religions have been
trying... either they are focusing you on the past, or they are focusing
you on future, beyond death. No religion bothers that you should be
alive, laughing, living, loving, flowering -- here and now -- and that's
my purpose.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK THAT THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE BIG BUSINESS AND
THAT IS THE WAY TO CONTROL PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is a great conspiracy between the politicians and the priests.
It has been for thousands of years. The conspiracy is that the
politician rules people as far as worldly things are concerned and the
priest rules people as far as their psychology, their mind, their souls
are concerned. And they have enslaved man in every possible way: the
politician from the outside and the priest from the inside -- they have
destroyed all potential of human beings.</p><p>My work is to bring that potential back, make the person aware that
he is not guilty if Adam and Eve disobeyed God -- that is their
business. You cannot be guilty for Adam and Eve disobeying God. This is
so stupid! In the first place, disobedience is not always bad. And as
far as Adam and Eve's disobedience is concerned, it was certainly
beneficial to humanity. In fact, God was the enemy, because he was
prohibiting Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of knowledge and the
tree of eternal life. Now, who is the enemy?</p><p>Wisdom, knowledge, science -- all that we value in life -- paintings,
poetry, sculpture, nothing would have happened if Adam and Eve had not
disobeyed. They would have been still naked animals in the garden of
Eden, chewing grass!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MY GOD, I HOPE THAT... I CAN'T PICTURE ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM
CHEWING GRASS!</p><p>A: You cannot picture it because of Adam and Eve. You should feel
grateful to Adam and Eve!</p><p>Q: I DO NOW!</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU KNOW, PSYCHOLOGISTS TELL US ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE DIRECTED
BACK TO OUR MOTHER, BUT NOW YOU'RE TAKING IT SO DAMN FAR BACK, I CAN'T
EVEN COMPREHEND IT!</p><p>A: They take all the problems to the mother and they forget the real
father. That is male chauvinistic psychology. The whole psychology is
created by man, just as all the religions are created by man. The woman
is condemned by the religions, and she is condemned now by the
psychologists. In fact the psychologist is slowly taking the place of
the priest because the priest is becoming out of date. Younger
generations are no more interested in the priest. They have seen five
thousand years of human history, what these priests have done.</p><p>The younger generation is more interested in psychotherapy, in
psychoanalysis, in other different methods of psychic exploration. The
priest is no more in the powerful position that he has always been.</p><p>So you will be surprised that all the priests in the world are now
studying psychology, to become psychotherapists. It is going to become a
necessary qualification for every bishop, every priest, to have some
degree of psychology, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, because they are
aware that their power is slipping away and the psychologist is
replacing them. He is becoming the new priest. But the trouble is, the
new priest is also serving the old vested interest; he is not
revolutionary.</p><p>Q: IS NOT THE PROCLIVITY TOWARD PSYCHOLOGY APPOINTMENTS OR PSYCHIATRY
APPOINTMENTS -- WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY, AS THEY STATE
IT, FIND OUT ABOUT THEMSELVES -- SOMEWHAT THE SAME PARALLEL AS TO WHAT
YOU'RE OFFERING HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No! Because your psychologists, even the founders -- Sigmund
Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Adler, Assagioli -- even they knew nothing
about themselves, so how can they help you to know yourself?</p><p>Jung had been to India. He went to see the Taj Mahal, he went to
Calcutta, to Bombay, and everywhere he was told, "You being a great
psychologist, the place you should go first is to a man in south India,
Maharishi Raman." That man was conceived by the whole country as one who
knows himself "You should go there</p><p>and see whether it is true or not. And if he knows himself, perhaps
you can learn something from him; if he does not know, you can help him
to know."</p><p>But he would not go there, and in his diary he wrote: "I was afraid
to go there, to face the eyes of a man who knows himself, because I
don't know myself." He returned without going to Maharishi Raman. And
when he was back he must have been feeling guilty, that this is not
right. Going to see the ruins of palaces was worthless for a
psychologist. He was not a historian. Going to see big cities, what was
the point for him? He must have started feeling guilty, that everywhere
he went, every friend he knew, all the professors in all the
universities, in all the psychological departments, were pointing
towards one man -- and he did not go there.</p><p>Out of that guilt he started writing against Indian mysticism. He
started saying that Westerners should remain aloof to the Eastern
tradition of mysticism, because it is dangerous for the Western man.
Western man's development is different, Eastern man's development is
different, their psychologies are different. This he said for the first
time after coming back from India.</p><p>Psychologies are not different. There may be minute details which are
different, but the basic psychology is not different, cannot be
different. He projected his own fear over all history.</p><p>So I don't think these psychologists are helping anybody in any way.
They can't help themselves. Do you know, the suicide rate of
psychologists is double that of average human beings.</p><p>Q: I THINK IT'S EVEN WORSE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. It may have grown higher, because for five years I have not
been reading a single word, of any book, of any newspaper. For five
years I have simply stopped... so perhaps it may have gone higher. But
five years ago, it was double. And the same was the situation with
madness -- it was double any other profession. And the same was the
proportion of all kinds of perverted acts.</p><p>These people -- suicidal, insane, committing perverted acts, finding
excuses to do them through psychology -- do you think they can help
anybody to know himself?</p><p>Q: IF YOUR THINKING AND YOUR BELIEF IS AS YOU STATE IT -- AND I
ASSUME CERTAINLY THAT IT IS -- AND THE WORLD IS IN THE CHAOS THAT IT'S
IN... I MEAN, THIS IS ABOUT AS SCREWED UP AS IT CAN GET.…</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:... MAYBE A LITTLE WORSE DOWN THE LINE, BUT I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY
CLOSE TO MAXIMUM.</p><p>A: It is.</p><p>Q: WHY THEN DOES NOT BHAGWAN STEP FORWARD, NOT AS A SAVIOR OF THE
WORLD, NOT AS A GOD, BUT AS A MAN WHO HAS RECOGNIZED WHAT THE PROBLEM
IS, HAS AN IDEA OF THE SOLUTION, AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO DO
NOT KNOW? GRANTED, IT'S AVAILABLE IF THEY COME HERE, BUT IT IS A MASSIVE
JOURNEY TO COME HERE, AND THE ROAD IS TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY, WHICH
DOESN'T HELP, EITHER.…</p><p>A: It is a massive journey. That's why you are here: you take the
message. Q: BUT I'M NOT A MISSIONARY EITHER.</p><p>A: No, you are not a missionary.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A MISSIONARY.</p><p>A: No. I don't want anybody to be a missionary.…</p><p>Q: BUT YOU'VE BECOME A MAN OF THE WORLD. A: No.</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE BECOME A MAN WHO IS VERY VISIBLE. OH, BUT OF COURSE YOU
HAVE.</p><p>A: Mmm?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE WORLD PRESS KNOWS ABOUT BHAGWAN. YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE GREAT
SHOW BUSINESS TEACHERS OF ALL TIME.</p><p>A: That's true!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT AT
THE SAME TIME, ON A SERIOUS NOTE -- WELL, AM I CORRECT OR AM I NOT? --
IF YOUR MESSAGE IS AS YOU STATED, WOULD IT NOT BE TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL
MANKIND IF BHAGWAN WOULD TAKE HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD?</p><p>A: No, not on the road. I can manage from here! And I am managing it
well!</p><p>Q: WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH, GETTING BACK
AGAIN.… YOU KNOW, I WAS INTIMIDATED.… I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES, A
RECENT ARTICLE -- AND ON THE BACK PAGE IS THE KIDS' CORNER WHICH WAS THE
ONLY ONE I UNDERSTOOD. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT COLUMN, A YOUNGSTER
HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT
WAS HELD HERE TWO WEEKS AGO AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORLD PRESS TO
GATHER AND MEET WITH YOU, AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY, BUT ALL HE
HEARD WAS THE SAME OLD QUESTIONS.</p><p>NOW I HAVE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN SINCE THE PRESS KIT WHICH CONTAINED
THAT PARTICULAR EDITION CAME TO ME, TRYING TO THINK OF SOME OTHER
QUESTIONS. BUT I'M JUST A PRETTY SIMPLE GUY. WHAT I SEE IS, VERY SIMPLY,
THAT YOU HAVE SOME THINGS TO SAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THIS POINT
DON'T BUY, WHICH YOU MAY NOT CARE ABOUT. WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT
IT?</p><p>A: Why should I care?</p><p>Q: BUT WHY SHOULDN'T YOU CARE?... AND WE CAN PLAY MONOPOLY WITH THIS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU STATE THAT YOUR INTEREST IS IN THE INDIVIDUAL. IS THAT ONLY
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HERE, OR WITHIN THE RAJNEESH GROUP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. The individual is everywhere, whether he is here or not,
because only the individual exists. Societies are just names,
collectivities are all names. The reality is only of the individual. And
I am trying my best, sitting in my room. That's why You can see in all
the papers, on the radio, on the television, a man who does not go out
of this small valley. And I will go on hammering all over the world from
here. What is the point of traveling?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS: YOU DO NOT GO OUT OF THE VALLEY, BUT IS
IT NOT CORRECT THAT YOU SPENT THREE NIGHTS IN BEND AT THE RIVERHOUSE
MOTEL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEN SOMEONE IS PAYING YOU THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE
IMPERSONATING YOU.</p><p>A: Hmm!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BECAUSE IT WAS TOLD TO ME THAT YOU SPENT A SUNDAY NIGHT, A MONDAY
NIGHT AND A TUESDAY NIGHT, WITH A NURSE AND A BODYGUARD. AND YOU WERE
SEEN IN THE JACUZZI AND IN THE LOUNGE AND YOU WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME.
SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THEY KEPT SNIFFING MY HAIR TODAY BEFORE I SAT
DOWN TO TALK TO YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DIDN'T SNIFF EVERYBODY'S HAIR
AT THE RIVERHOUSE IN BEND, OREGON.</p><p>THOSE KINDS OF MISDIRECTED IDEAS -- IF IN FACT YOU WERE NOT THERE --
SOMETIMES BREAK DOWN A LITTLE CREDIBILITY FOR BHAGWAN, AND I WONDER IF
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING -- GETTING BACK TO IT SOMEWHAT
SERIOUSLY -- TO BE PROJECTED TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND.</p><p><br></p><p>A: First, the nonserious part.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DON'T TRY TO GET A BIGGER LAUGH THAN I DID.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was not in the hotel, but I can be.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, YOU PROBABLY COULD BUY THE HOTEL IF YOU WANTED TO.</p><p><br></p><p>A: In fact, I have... and I have everything that any hotel in America
can have. You have just to see my bathroom. Perhaps it is the best in
the whole world.</p><p>Q: YOUR BATHROOM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: My bathroom.</p><p>Q: IS THAT AN INVITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE. I'VE BEEN TOLD I
BELONGED IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE, BUT NEVER INVITED TO ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am a rare and a unique person in every way: I invite you into my
bathroom! Q: THAT IS UNIQUE. BUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM THERE?</p><p>A: There is nowhere to go. Enjoy the jacuzzi there, enjoy the shower
there, enjoy the hot shower, enjoy the ice-cold shower.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THEN GET OUT... L UNDERSTAND! I NEED TO KNOW THIS FOR MY OWN
EDIFICATION: HAVE YOU EVER INVITED A MEMBER OF THE PRESS TO YOUR
BATHROOM BEFORE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:... because I never liked any man the way I like you. Q: I WONDER
IF THIS COULD BE LOVE?</p><p>A: This is!</p><p>Q: INVITED TO THE BATHROOM.… WELL, I'M SURE THE LISTENERS OF THIS
PROGRAM ARE THINKING YOU AND I ARE GOING TO START A NIGHTCLUB ACT.</p><p>WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL -- SINCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A MOMENT
AGO -- OF UNITING THE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT
MATERIALISTIC, AND THE EASTERN PHILOSOPHY, WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY NOT
MATERIALISTIC BUT IS MORE AN INNER -- WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT -- AN INNER
RECOGNITION OF ONESELF?</p><p>NOW YOU HAVE DONE A MAGNIFICENT JOB IN MANY RESPECTS -- THAT DIAMOND
WRISTWATCH OF COURSE IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EASTERN PHILOSOPHY -- AND YET
THE REST OF YOUR PRESENTATION IS SOMEWHAT EASTERN. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
THOSE TWO CULTURES TO UNITE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's what I have been doing! And that's why both sides of the
culture are angry at me. The Easterners are angry with me because they
think I am materialist.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND ARE THEY RIGHT? A: No.</p><p>Q: YOU'RE NOT MATERIALISTIC?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, not in their sense. And the Western people -- particularly the
materialist, the communist -- they are angry with me because I am
bringing spiritualism.</p><p>My approach is that man is both together. This existence is not split
into matter and spirit. This existence is one organic unity, just as
your soul and your body are an organic unity. Your soul cannot exist
without your body, and your body cannot be alive without the soul.</p><p>I am destroying the whole idea of the separation, of a split between
matter and mind, body and soul, materialism and spiritualism. I call
myself Zorba the Buddha. My restaurants, my discos are all named after
me: Zorba the Buddha.</p><p>Now Buddhists are angry. The ambassador of Ceylon in America wrote me
a letter saying, "In my country people will be angry about it. Please
don't use Buddha's name with Zorba." I replied to him, "We don't mean
your Buddha; your Buddha's name was Gautam Siddhartha. Buddha is not
anybody's name, it is a quality. It means the Awakened One. It can be
used for anybody who is awakened. So don't get upset about it."</p><p>My effort is that Zorba and Buddha have to be bridged. Zorba
represents the materialist's life in all its luxury -- hence this
diamond wristwatch, hence all my Rolls Royces. I live the most luxurious
life that any man has ever lived, with no worry. People have much more
money -- I don't have a single cent -- but they cannot live such a
luxurious life as I am living, with no worry, no bank account, no income
tax... and having everything that anybody can have!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT IS YOUR SECRET, BHAGWAN? I REALLY THINK YOU'RE IN THE WRONG
BUSINESS. I MEAN BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST DOCUMENTED, YOU MUST BE ONE
OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CON MEN, IT WOULD SEEM.</p><p>A: I am!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND IT TAKES A GREAT MAN TO ADMIT THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND IT TAKES AN EQUALLY GREAT MAN TO SIT AND ACCEPT IT AND REVEL
IN IT, BHAGWAN.</p><p>A: Right!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORMER DEAD CITY OF
ANTELOPE. THIS HAS OF COURSE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROVERSY. I HAVE
ONLY LIVED IN THIS CENTRAL OREGON AREA FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS.
THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA. IT WAS MY FIRST TRIP
THROUGH ANTELOPE, AND I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO ASK IS: WHY
WOULD ANYBODY WANT ANTELOPE? I MEAN WHAT IS THE PURPOSE AND</p><p>WHAT ARE THE PLANS? I DON'T SEE IT BECOMING A RESORT AREA. I DON'T
SEE IT BECOMING AN INDUSTRIAL AREA. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE FOR
THEIR OWN PARTICULAR REASONS, WHO OF COURSE DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUCH A
GREAT MAN -- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. WHAT WAS THE POINT?</p><p>A: In fact, again you bring me to something in which I have no
interest. Just not to be impolite to you, I am answering it.</p><p>When we came here four years ago there was 126 square miles of land,
just desert, and that one house there, for a guard to take care of the
land -- what could he do with 126 square miles of land...? And the
owners had been trying to sell it for almost half a century, but who
would purchase this desert, for what?</p><p>When we came here I wanted a big place. That big a property was not
available anywhere else. When we came here we needed our people to stay
in Antelope, because there were no houses here. Before we made houses
and roads and restaurants and eating places, they had to remain in
Antelope. The population of Antelope was less than my sannyasins. And
the Antelope population started behaving with great hostility: they
wouldn't allow any permit, they wouldn't allow them to purchase any
land, they wouldn't allow change of zone -- small things. My people told
them, "We don't want your city or your government. We are simply here
for the time being, and we will be moving to our own city. But we have
to create the city, and before we create it we have to be here. This is
the nearest place."</p><p>And because they wouldn't listen, and they tried in every possible
way to hinder, naturally my people thought that the best way was to take
over the government. What is the need of asking permission from these
people when we have the government and we give the permission? -- so
they took over, there was no problem in it.</p><p>If you had come four years ago and seen Antelope, you would not have
believed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT TODAY. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL THE
FLACK WAS ABOUT.</p><p>A: Four years ago it was absolutely a cemetery. Q: WHAT IS IT
NOW?</p><p>A: Now it is a dancing place. We have made a dead city alive. Now
hundreds of sannyasins are living there. And since we took over the
government, we have done many things there: we have made better roads,
we are trying to make new houses, a big housing colony, we are going to
make a big hospital there, we have</p><p>taken the school and raised the standard of the school. We are doing
everything there, and now it is part of us. Now nobody can take it over
from us.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THEY ARE TRYING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are trying and we are enjoying. They are trying to collect
84,000 signatures so that in the next election they can ask the governor
to dissolve Antelope into Wasco County.</p><p>They certainly know they cannot win, because only eight or ten old
Antelopians are there and one hundred sannyasins are there. They cannot
win democratically, and this is absolutely unconstitutional. If it is
done, then we are going to fight up to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Q: WAS IT CONSTITUTIONAL TO TAKE IT OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Taking over is not the problem. They are the majority; the
majority should rule. It is not a question of taking over.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH QUESTION THOUGH, NOW THAT YOUR CITY IS
ESTABLISHED?</p><p>A: Not yet. They are not allowing it to be established yet. Our city
is under litigation. And we have been telling them that if you allow us
whatever we need, if you help -- and we are creating a beautiful place
for you in a desert -- we can leave Antelope. That was our basic
proposal to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THAT STANDS NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. No more.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Now we are not going to leave!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INVITE ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE INTO YOUR
BATHROOM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU WILL FIGHT THIS AS HIGH AS IT MUST GO?</p><p>A: We will fight it, and I know constitutionally it is absolutely
wrong to dissolve. So let them.. and then we go to the Supreme Court.
And it has been so in many cases; we have never been losers.</p><p>Last year we brought thousands of street people to share our homes
with us, and the Oregon government got simply mad about it. They started
thinking that we were going to take over the county or we were going to
take over Oregon.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEIR FEELING WAS THAT YOU WERE CONTROLLING THE ELECTION, I THINK,
IS THAT NOT CORRECT?</p><p>A: No, not at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, I MEAN their FEELING WAS THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Their feeling was that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE ELECTION COMMISSION LAST WEEK.</p><p>A: Yes. That has been rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT, IN DEFENSE OF YOUR ACTIONS, IS NOT THE OREGON ELECTION LAW,
RESIDENT LAW -- I MEAN YOU CAN WALK IN AND TEN MINUTES LATER YOU CAN
VOTE -- SO ANTIQUATED THAT, ON THE BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU WANTED TO CONTROL
THE ELECTION -- WHICH PROBABLY YOU DID...</p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:... THAT YOU COULD BRING THESE PEOPLE IN AND THAT THEY COULD HAVE
VOTED LEGALLY IN THAT ELECTION. IS THAT NOT CORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We were not concerned with taking over the county. What will we do
with the county? It is unnecessary, taking the burden of the county,
which is bankrupt -- why should we bother? We have to develop our own
place!</p><p>Q: WHAT DID YOU BRING THE PEOPLE IN FOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We had surplus money. After every festival we have nearabout two
to three million dollars and we want to share it. This time we will be
bringing some other group. Each year we are going to bring different
groups of people -- perhaps we may invite the blacks!</p><p>Q: MY GOD, I DON'T KNOW IF OREGON'S READY FOR THAT!</p><p><br></p><p>A: Get ready! But every year we are going to invite somebody or
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, THE COMPLAINT THOUGH, IN THE BEND AREA AND IN OTHER AREAS,
WAS THAT YOU BROUGHT THEM IN AND THEN YOU TURNED THEM LOOSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THAT THEY THEN BECAME WARDS OF THE VARIOUS VENUES THAT THEY
LANDED IN, FOUND THEMSELVES IN... FOUND THEMSELVES INTENTIONALLY
BREAKING LAWS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE.…</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. That is absolutely wrong, because we had brought people first
with a contract that whenever they wanted to go, we would give them the
ticket, return ticket.</p><p>Q: YOU PROVIDED THEM ALL A TICKET?</p><p><br></p><p>A: We provided all those people with whom we had the contract. After
two weeks, we dropped the idea of the contract, because the idea was...
how would these poor people dare to come here on a one-way ticket? So we
gave them round trip tickets -- they could go back -- but once they
settled here, they started sending messages to their friends. Then we
told the people, "If they want to come.… Your people are there, you can
contact them. You know what the situation is here -- if they want to
come, we will give them only a one-way ticket"</p><p>-- and that was the contract. So those people who had the contract
for a one-way ticket got a one-way ticket, and that was their
responsibility. We have nothing to do with it.</p><p>And we were giving them three months to be here, every facility, but
the Christians -- particularly Christian churches and associations
around -- became very much troubled about that. The fear was that
perhaps we would turn them into sannyasins. Christians started coming
here, Christian priests started having demonstrations in Madras, in
Portland, and they persuaded them to go back.</p><p>Here they were receiving everything free, here they were living
better than they had ever lived before, and many of them are still here.
After three months it was a free choice for them: if they wanted to go
back, their ticket was there; if they didn't want to go back, they could
remain here. They HAVE remained here, and we have been receiving
hundreds of letters from the people who have left saying that it was
wrong on their side to listen to the Christians and leave the place.
They would love to come back again.</p><p>It was not our responsibility letting those people loose in Oregon.
It was the State of Oregon and the Christian churches of Oregon who
created the whole paranoia. The state created the paranoia about the
election, and the churches created the paranoia about religion. But the
people who are here -- nobody has tried to make them sannyasins. If they
wanted to become, that was their business.</p><p>And sannyas is such a nonserious phenomenon. It is not a fanatic type
of group; it is very loose and free. If you want to become a sannyasin
we don't make any conditions, we don't ask for any qualifications. You
simply become a sannyasin. If you want to drop it, goodbye, you drop it.
When you drop nobody stops you, when you want to become a sannyasin
nobody stops you.</p><p>So those people who are still here are never going to leave. And we
had no intention about the election. That's what the commission has
found, that we had no intention at all to bring those people for the
election.</p><p>Q: IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THIS SEGMENT OF THE GENERAL SOCIETY TO
COEXIST WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF OREGON UNDER THE CURRENT
STRUCTURE OF THINGS? CAN YOU GUYS GET ALONG WITH THE FOLKS OUTSIDE? IS
THERE A POSSIBILITY OF THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't think so.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I MEAN, I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT, BUT NO MAN OR NO
GROUP IS AN ISLAND, AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH. AND AT SOME
POINT THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME COOPERATION IN SOMETHING. I KNOW
YOU ANSWERED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE IF THERE WOULD BE ANY POSSIBILITY
FOR COEXISTENCE, SAY WITH THE PEOPLE OF WHAT USED TO BE ANTELOPE, AND
YOUR ANSWER WAS NO. BUT MY QUESTION IS: IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY THAT
THE RAJNEESHEES CAN BECOME COEXISTING, NOT SUBSERVIENT, BUT COEXIST WITH
THE PEOPLE OF OREGON?</p><p>A: No. To me the word COEXISTENCE is political, and it does not carry
any good connotations with it. Coexistence means that we are enemies,
but -- what to do? -- we have to get along.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CHOOSE ANOTHER WORD THEN, WHERE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, WHERE THE
STATE OF OREGON IS CONCERNED, THAT THE RAJNEESHEES COULD IN FACT
ACCEPT.</p><p>A: I don't compromise on anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO COMPROMISE.</p><p>A: No. I will make every effort to bring to the Oregonians what we
are. We are exposing ourselves to all media and everybody is welcome,
but we are going to remain ourselves and there is no need for any
coexistence. They exist there in their way, we exist here in our own way
-- PARALLEL EXISTENCE, that is my word.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PARALLEL MIGHT BE EVEN A BETTER WORD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes</p><p><br></p><p>Q: Coexistence, I THINK, DOES DENOTE A HOSTILITY THAT IS
ACCEPTED.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's it. That's why I said "Never." When the question was asked
about coexistence, I said, "Never." But the woman did not even wait for
me to explain what I wanted to say. She did not ask about the
implications. She simply left. That was enough. Coexistence finished!
That woman immediately left the mike, and that was really symbolic.</p><p>Q: WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT YOU AND I WOULD GET ALONG VERY WELL, AND I'D PROBABLY DOMINATE
THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS.</p><p>AT THE... AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT -- AND THESE ARE THE
MECHANICAL THINGS, SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRESS
CONFERENCE TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE ABOUT GOD, AND THE FACT THAT YOUR
ANSWER OR RESPONSE WAS, I BELIEVE, PARAPHRASING "HE IS MAN'S GREATEST
LIE."</p><p><br></p><p>A: Right.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OR SHE IS MAN'S GREATEST LIE -- WHICHEVER THE CASE MAY BE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Right!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT'S IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: LET'S TALK AGAIN ABOUT YOUR BATHROOM!</p><p>WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION THAT CAME UP AT SOME POINT. I HAD</p><p>READ SO MUCH ABOUT RAJNEESHEES AND BHAGWAN. FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS IN
THIS AREA, I HAD NOW BECOME SO INUNDATED WITH INFORMATION.… YOUR CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE, YOUR PUBLIC</p><p>RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, SENT ME THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRESS KIT. IN
SIXTEEN YEARS I COULD NOT READ EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THERE, BUT I
TRIED! THE QUESTION THAT HAS COME UP IS THE JIM JONES PROBLEM, THE
PARALLEL THAT HAS BEEN DRAWN THAT THIS IS IN FACT A RELIGIOUS FANATIC
WHO IS CONTROLLING A CULT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL DO ANYTHING THAT HE DECIDES
THAT THEY SHOULD DO -- WHETHER OR NOT HE DECIDES THAT. I BELIEVE YOUR
ANSWER WAS SIMPLY THAT THE CHRISTIANITY FACTOR IS NOT IN EXISTENCE HERE,
THAT LIFE AFTER DEATH IS BETTER THAN LIFE DURING LIFE. IS THAT THE
COMPLETE ANSWER, AND IS IT NOT PROBABLY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT IN SOME
RESPECTS THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED AT JONESTOWN WAS A RESULT OF PEOPLE
FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL BLINDLY, AS OPPOSED TO A CHRISTIANITY
QUESTION?</p><p>A: Wait!</p><p>It is not only that he was a Christian priest. There is great
implication in it. The whole Christianity is death-oriented; the cross
is its symbol. And if Jesus was not crucified, there would have been no
Christianity at all. The Jews simply missed the point. The man was nuts!
They should have ignored him, he was doing no harm to anybody. To
crucify that nut created Christianity. I call Christianity, CROSSIANITY.
It is not Christianity.</p><p>Q: HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO SAY BHAGWAN IS NUTS, AND IF THEY WERE TO
CRUCIFY YOU WOULD THE SAME THING HAPPEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It will happen again if they crucify me. Again there will be
another Christianity, so better tell them.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LEAVE YOU ALONE!</p><p>A: Leave me alone!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: OKAY.</p><p>A: It is in their favor if they leave me alone. If they assassinate
me, it will be in my favor.</p><p>Reverend Jim Jones had no similarity at any point with me. All his
disciples were mostly black, illiterate. All my disciples are
white.…</p><p>Q: I SAW THREE BLACKS TODAY.</p><p>A: Yes, three you can see in five thousand people. That does not make
even one percent. These white people have come from all over the world,
they are all well educated, most of them are graduates, a large number
of them have master's degrees, many are Ph.D.s, few are D.Litts. His
group and my group are poles apart.</p><p>Those people were blindly following him, because that is what Jesus
teaches. He was simply repeating Jesus' drama. Jesus is responsible.</p><p>Q: FOR JONESTOWN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. And the pope should be hanged! Q: WHO SHOULD BE...?</p><p>A: For Jonestown -- the pope.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, HE WASN'T IN OFFICE THEN. THE POPE AT THE TIME SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HANGED...?</p><p>A: Any.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JUST PICK ONE OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Any will do, because he represents Jesus Christ.</p><p>Q: BUT THEN WHY NOT HANG ALL THE PRIESTS AND THE BISHOPS AND THE
CARDINALS AND THE ARCHBISHOPS...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That will be great!</p><p>But that's what Jesus was doing with people, his followers: "Believe
in me, have faith in me, follow me." And that's what Reverend Jones was
doing: "Whatever I say you have to follow."</p><p>Here I am saying to my people, "Don't believe in my statements. Think
over them, argue over them. You love me -- that is another thing. That
should not become your belief."</p><p>Q: BUT ONE OF THE GREAT PLOYS IN THE HUMAN MIND AND MANEUVERABILITY
IS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY, "DON'T DO THAT," WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO DO IT
EVEN MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: So what do you want? I should say, "Do it"?</p><p>Q: NO, NO. DOES THAT NOT PUT AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU TO HAVE
THIS KIND OF DEVOTION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Because I have been consistently denying to them, telling
them, almost every day for thirty years, that I am not your leader, that
I am not a prophet, that I am not a messiah, that I am not the only
begotten son of God -- I am just an ordinary man as you are, with a
slight difference: you are asleep, I am awake. But that is not much of a
difference. I can just shake you a little and you will be awake.</p><p>I have been telling them that I don't have any dogma to give them,
any belief system to give them. Christians have told me that I should
publish a catechism in which my whole doctrine is presented in short,
but that is impossible. I have 360 books and I have contradicted myself
thousands of times, because to me, consistency is something that belongs
to the stupid, unintelligent, retarded. A consciousness which goes on
growing is bound to contradict at each step the step that preceded
it.</p><p>They cannot make any belief out of my books, out of my teachings.
They can love me, and love is not adoration. Adoration is for somebody
who is higher than you. Now I am doing my hardest to tell them that I am
not higher, but I don't take any responsibility if they don't listen. If
somebody adores me, that is his responsibility, not mine. If somebody
thinks he is my follower, that is his idea, not mine. I am not
responsible for anybody. I am only responsible for myself, and I want my
people to be responsible for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS ANYONE HERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE?</p><p>A: No, nobody is responsible for anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS ANYONE IN THE WORLD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE ELSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In fact they should not be. Only politicians and priests have been
exploiting people and saying "We are responsible for you. We take the
responsibility." That is a strategy to make them enslaved. The priest
says, "Don't be bothered. You just follow the Christian dogma, have
faith in Jesus Christ and you will be saved." They are taking their
responsibility. Jesus was taking the responsibility for saving the whole
of mankind, and he has not been seen for two thousand years -- what a
great savior!</p><p>I am nobody's savior. I have saved myself, that's enough. Q: QUITE
LUXURIOUSLY TOO.</p><p>A: Quite luxuriously, because I don't believe in any ascetic ideas.
My idea about asceticism is that it is a psychological sickness, it is
masochism. It is torturing yourself, and in a sick mind you can enjoy
torturing yourself</p><p>There are two kinds of torturers: the sadist who tortures somebody
else and enjoys, and the masochist who tortures himself and enjoys. Both
kinds of people fit together very beautifully. The best couple in the
world will be a sadist husband, a masochist wife, or vice versa. Both
will be of great.…</p><p>Q: A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN, RIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, a marriage made in heaven, because one will enjoy torturing
the other and the other will enjoy being tortured. So that is perfect,
the best marriage I can conceive.</p><p>I am not a masochist, hence I enjoy everything that life can give to
me. And I am not a sadist, so I don't tell any of my people to torture
themselves in any way: enjoy to the fullest. And I don't give them any
promises.</p><p>Just see the difference: I don't give any promises for their future,
after death, that they will be benefited, rewarded -- I don't even talk
about the future, I simply talk about this moment. I cannot believe how
people can even think of me in reference to Reverend Jones and
Jonestown. This is just the opposite place.</p><p>Here we love, we live, we live to totality, and we try to squeeze
every moment to the very last drop of its juice. I have never ordered
them in anything.</p><p>And as far as death is concerned, I am life-affirmative. I want death
to disappear from the earth, and there is a possibility if the idiotic
politicians don't go on wasting scientific genius in piling up nuclear
weapons. There is a possibility, very commonly accepted by biologists,
that a man can live for three hundred years very easily, and without any
old age.</p><p>In India I have seen people, in a small part of Kashmir which is now
under Pakistan -- they have invaded that part; it is a very small place,
a few thousand people -- who live for 150 or 160 years. The oldest man
in that community was 180 years old when I went there, and he was
working in the field!</p><p>I asked him, "How long have you worked?" He said, "I don't know how
to count. People say that I have been working here for at least 150
years. When I was thirty, my father died, and since then I have been
working." And he was still young!</p><p>There are hundreds of people in the Soviet Union who have reached
beyond 150; they also are middle Asian, from the other side of the
Himalayas. Scientists think that three hundred years is very easily
possible, and if more efforts are made, we can postpone death as long as
possible.</p><p>Unless a man wants to die -- because who would like to live for one
thousand years? Perhaps.…</p><p>Q: I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE GUY OF 185 WOULD WANT TO KEEP LIVING
WHILE HE'S WORKING IN THE FIELDS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: You cannot. It is difficult to believe when you.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEN WE'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THIS PLANET. THE
ENTIRE PLANET WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED.</p><p>A: No, nothing. All that we have to change is the way we have been
producing children -- only that has to be changed, nothing else, because
the father's cell and the mother's egg have the program for the whole
life. The meeting of those two decides the whole life of the person: how
long he will live, what kind of nose he will have, what color of hair,
what color of skin, what kind of diseases he will have, when he will
die. The whole program is in the first two genes.</p><p>The only thing that bioengineering has to do is to change the
program. And they ARE capable, they are saying they are capable of
changing the whole program, that the child will not have any old age,
that the child will live three hundred years, that he will not be
vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, infections, that he will have the
highest I.Q., intelligence possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD THAT BE, IN YOUR MIND, A HEALTHY WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It will be for the first time healthy. Up to now it has been just
a sick and mad world. It will be really healthy when there are no
diseases.…</p><p>Q: WELL, WOULD YOU DO AWAY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
CONSTRUCTING GENES AND THE DNA PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE, AND
PROCREATION AND THE ENTIRE PICTURE -- WOULD YOU DO AWAY WITH EGOS, WOULD
YOU DO AWAY WITH THE COMPETITIVE FACTOR? COULD YOU DO AWAY WITH ALL OF
THE NEGATIVES LIKE JEALOUSY, LIKE GREED AND THINGS LIKE THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. That can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO YOU'RE REALLY TALKING THEN ABOUT A GENEALOGICAL, BIONIC PERSON,
CONSTRUCTED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. And that will be the dream of all those people who for
centuries have been thinking of a superman.</p><p>Q: DOES THE WORLD REALLY WANT A SUPERMAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: This world does not deserve it.</p><p>Q: BUT THIS IS WHERE IT HAS TO START, OR AT LEAST WHERE OUR LIFETIME
IS CONCERNED.</p><p>A: It needs it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THIS IS NOT "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" AND YOU SUDDENLY OPEN THE CURTAIN
AND THERE IS A SUPERMAN -- IT'S THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS, THE
EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS.…</p><p>A: Very simple. Within twenty years -- because one generation of
twenty-year- old young people, supermen moving around, not hippies --
you will see the difference. Within twenty years -- it is not a question
of a very long time. And when we can give the child the intelligence of
an Einstein, we can give him the aesthetic sense of a van Gogh, we can
give him a face as beautiful as Alexander the Great or Cleopatra, why
should we go on living with this mediocre, biological, accidental
world?</p><p>And it is strange that whenever I mention it to people, they raise
the question that it will be something inhuman, mechanical, but about
other things they don't bother. When you have cancer, then you don't
say,"It is natural. Leave it, don't do anything, because that operation
is going to be mechanical, that operation is going to be technological,
and this beautiful cancer in me is natural."</p><p>When we are ready to take man-made medicines for our diseases -- and
diseases come from nature -- nobody bothers about it, everybody is
willing for medicines, operations, surgeries.</p><p>Q: WELL, THEY ACCEPT IT TO HEAL, BUT NOT TO CREATE.</p><p>A: That is just the next step! If so much healing is needed, why not
create a man who needs no healing?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DON'T KNOW IF I BUY ALL OF THAT PART OF IT. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING BUT... I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY TO START ACCEPTING.… WE'VE GONE
FROM YOUR BATHROOM TO CREATING SUPERMAN AND THAT IS A GIANT, QUANTUM
LEAP FOR ME.</p><p>A: It is!</p><p>Q: AND FOR MOST PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Not for my people! They are accustomed to</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WE'RE BACK TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT BHAGWAN SAYS.…</p><p>A: No. That is not the way. They have been listening to me and they
know that I give them every day a quantum leap that they have never
expected. And they have been with me for a decade or two decades, and
they had not been expecting that I will say this. They go on waiting for
tomorrow morning.</p><p>Q: AND THEN THEY SAY, "WHAT HAS HE GOT FOR US TODAY?"</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes!</p><p>Q: COUPLE OF THINGS, POPULAR QUESTIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NEWSPAPER
REPORTS, TELEVISION, RADIO, ANY OTHER FORM OF MEDIA THAT THERE MAY BE,
THAT THE RAJNEESH EMPIRE -- YOU EXCUSE MY WORD -- IS CRUMBLING, THAT
THERE ARE MAJOR DEFECTIONS, SOME OF THE CORPORATIONS ARE NOT DOING AS
WELL FINANCIALLY, AND SUSTAINING THEMSELVES AS IT HAD APPEARED THEY
WERE. TRUE OR FALSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is all wrong. But those people need some consolations. People
who are hostile to us need some consolations. If these things give them
consolations, good. But everything is wrong -- my empire is increasing
every day.</p><p>Q: WELL, PROBABLY IT'S BECAUSE YOUR RESTAURANT CLOSED IN PORTLAND,
DID IT NOT?</p><p>A: We closed it not because we are shrinking; we closed it because we
wanted our people to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DIDN'T BUSINESS GET A LITTLE BAD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, our business is increasing so much in Europe that we have to
send people from here to Europe.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DIDN'T YOU HAVE A BUSINESS THAT JUST WENT BANKRUPT SOMEWHERE?</p><p>A: Nowhere!</p><p>Q: I WONDER WHO I WAS READING ABOUT. WHERE DO THEY GET THESE
REPORTS?</p><p>A: These reports come to you or to the newspapers and they make big
headlines out of them. If a sannyasin has a business of his own and he
goes bankrupt, that does not mean that my empire is going bankrupt.</p><p>Q: BUT IT DOES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOUR
EMPIRE IS NOT SUCCEEDING.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They can go on dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THIS AN EMPIRE? IS THAT A QUOTE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is certainly an empire!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I CHOSE THE RIGHT WORD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is the right word.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT WHEN SOMEONE ASKED YOU AT THE PRESS
CONFERENCE IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE OVER ALL OF OREGON AND YOU SAID NO, IT
WAS TOO SMALL, YOU WANTED THE WORLD, THEY PROBABLY TOOK YOU SERIOUSLY.
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BHAGWAN?</p><p>A: I was serious!</p><p>Q: ARE YOU INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN CAN WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO TAKE PLACE? ANTELOPE
TODAY, THE WORLD TOMORROW?</p><p>A: No. We are not going to take the world the way we have taken
Antelope. This is nothing. We are going to take the world over in a
totally different way which is not political at all. We are increasing
our people all around the world. We will take it over spiritually. We
are not interested in politics. They forced us to take that dead town,
Antelope, they FORCED us to take it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAD THEY NOT FORCED YOU -- AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE
AND I WANTED TO CLARIFY IT -- HAD THEY NOT FORCED YOU, WOULD YOU HAVE
GIVEN IT BACK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Now, no.</p><p>Q: I THOUGHT YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. NOT NOW. I MEAN,
HAD THEY COOPERATED.</p><p>A: Things have gone. In the beginning if they had cooperated there
would have</p><p>been no question of us taking it, because it is unnecessary trouble
for us. We have our own work to do, we need more people here; we don't
want our people to live in Antelope, because it is unnecessary trouble.
Every morning they have to be brought here, every evening they have to
be sent back.</p><p>Q: THEY'D NEVER HAVE TO DISPLAY THEIR COURAGE TO ME, RIDING THAT ROAD
TWO TIMES A DAY, EVERY DAY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is something, because this road, this county road, is worse
than the road that goes to hell!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I CANNOT YET SPEAK FROM PERSONAL AUTHORIZATION ON THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I can, because I visited.</p><p>Q: I WILL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. IS THERE A HEAVEN AND IS THERE A
HELL? AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME WHAT PART OF OREGON THEY ARE BOTH
IN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You are sitting in heaven and the county road goes to hell!</p><p>Q: YOU ARE A MAN WHO CERTAINLY, THERE IS NO DOUBT, LOVES THE
CONTROVERSY THAT SURROUNDS YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ARE A MAN WHO I THINK WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EVERY HUMAN BEING IN
THIS ENTIRE WORLD AT LEAST TO HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. I would like the entire world either to love me or hate
me; I would not like a single individual in the whole world to ignore
me. And that's the way my empire is expanding. I have more friends, I
have more enemies -- every day they are increasing.</p><p>Q: YOU ARE ALSO A MAN WITH, WITHOUT QUESTION, A MAGNIFICENT SENSE OF
HUMOR. AND IN ORDER TO RULE THIS EMPIRE -- NOT RULE, I'M SORRY... YOU DO
NOT RULE; YOU JUST LIVE IN THIS EMPIRE -- TO</p><p>ACCEPT ALL OF THE HASSLES AND CONTROVERSIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS
AND PROBABLY SOME OF THE TRUTHS ABOUT YOURSELF, YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.</p><p>A: I really enjoy.…</p><p>Q: LET ME STOP YOU ONE SECOND. I READ IN THE OFFICE, IN THE WELCOME
ROOM -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?... THE VISITORS CENTER -- THAT IF THE WORLD
COULD LAUGH, IF EVERYONE IN THE WORLD COULD LAUGH OVER A TWENTY-FOUR
HOUR PERIOD IT WOULD CHANGE THIS ENTIRE MALIGNANCY THAT WE ALL SEEM TO
LIVE IN. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID; THAT'S WHAT I SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>A: It will help, but it will kill that woman. Laughter is good
medicine, but you</p><p>should take as much as you can absorb; otherwise it can kill you, it
can drive you mad.</p><p>Life is a very mysterious phenomenon where laughter is part and where
tears also are part. Once in a while to be sad, really sad, is not bad.
Sadness has its own beauty. You have just to learn to enjoy the beauty
of sadness, its silence, its depth.</p><p>Life is everything all together, and we allow our people to live in
all dimensions. If somebody is crying and weeping, nobody is going to
stop him here. Somebody may give him a hug and go on his way. That hug
was not to stop his tears, but just a spontaneous response.</p><p>We believe in life in its totality, in its days, in its nights, the
sunny days and the cloudy days. We believe that everything in life can
be enjoyed. You need just a little more awareness, more consciousness of
what is happening. You are not your mind, you are not your body. There
is a witness somewhere inside you who can go on looking at the mind, at
the emotions, at the physiological reactions. That witness is you. And
that witness is capable of enjoying everything, once you get centered
there.</p><p>My whole method of meditation is to get centered at your witness, and
then let life and its games go on. Enjoy, laugh, cry, but whatever you
do, do it totally, with no shame, with no guilt.</p><p>And, as you said, I am certainly a man who enjoys being
controversial. I cannot conceive a man who has any guts not being
controversial. The people who are not controversial are simply
hypocrites -- just goody-goody, nice to everybody, just changing their
masks the whole day, to fit with everybody.</p><p>One American, Dale Carnegie, has written a book, HOW TO WIN FRIENDS
AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE. My idea is "How to Influence People and Create
Enemies."</p><p>Q: WHY? WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, BY COMPARISON, TO CREATE ENEMIES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because if you can create an enemy, you have created a potential
friend. I will tell you one old Hassidic story.</p><p>Hassids are not traditional Jews. Jews don't accept Hassids as
religious for the same reason that nobody will accept my people as
religious: the Hassids sing and dance and enjoy and eat and drink.</p><p>This Hassid sent one of his disciples to the chief rabbi of Jerusalem
to present him the first copy of his book that had just been published.
And he said to the disciple, "When you give it to him, remember, give it
to him, not to anybody else. You have to be very alert and watch what he
says, remember exactly every word; what he does, remember exactly his
acts."</p><p>The disciple went. The chief rabbi was sitting in his garden -- it
was a beautiful evening, the sun was just setting -- and the wife of the
rabbi was also sitting there. He presented the book of his Master and
said, "It is my Master's book's first edition and this is the first book
that has come off the press. Out of great gratitude he sends it to
you."</p><p>The chief rabbi said, "That Hassid? He has some guts to send me his
book." He took the book from his hand and threw it over the fence into
the street. The wife said to him, "This is not right. You could have
thrown that book when the disciple had gone, or you could have put it in
the library where you have thousands of books. What harm could that book
have done to you?"</p><p>The disciple came back and he said, "That chief rabbi is just a
rotten man! He is not even a gentleman. You send him a present and he
throws it with such hatred over the fence into the street. But his wife
is certainly a woman worth respecting. She suggested to him,'You could
have thrown it afterwards. Why hurt him? Or you could have just put it
in your library where there are thousands of books. What harm could that
book have done to your library?' "</p><p>The Master said to the disciple, "I am going to convert that rabbi
one day, but his wife is beyond me."</p><p>Q: WHAT KIND OF A MAN ARE YOU? NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THAT -- WHAT YOUR THINKING IS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just crazy, nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: JUST A CRAZY OLD MAN? SOMEHOW I FELT THAT YOU WOULD ANSWER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p><p>A: It is a fact!</p><p>Q: WHEN YOU SAY, "JUST A CRAZY MAN..." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</p><p>A: Exactly what it means.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MENTALLY DERANGED? A: No.</p><p>Q: WELL, IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CRAZY, TO SOME, THAT'S WHAT IT
MEANS.</p><p>A: No. Crazy simply means one who has gone out of his mind. Now, two
types of people go out of their minds. One is the madman that you know
ordinarily as crazy; another is the meditator. He also goes out of his
mind, but going out of his mind he goes higher, to the witness. The
madman going out of the mind goes lower, to the mind. Both are crazy! I
belong to the first category.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TOMORROW I'M GOING TO TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN YOUR
CITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. AFTER THAT I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE
FORMER AND CURRENT RESIDENTS OF OUR FAVORITE SUBJECT, ANTELOPE.</p><p>A: Good!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF YOU WERE TO WANT ME TO SAY SOMETHING TO THEM DURING THIS
CONVERSATION -- NONE OF WHOM I'VE MET -- WHAT WOULD IT BE, IF
ANYTHING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I have nothing to say to them, because I don't consider they
will be able to understand anything. I have seen idiots around the
world, but Antelope simply defeats all the idiots. You will come across
them tomorrow!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I HAVE ENJOYED IT. I THINK YOU
ENJOYED IT TOO.</p><p>A: I enjoyed even more! Q: THANK YOU!</p><p>A: Good!</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-19>The Last Testament, Vol 1

Volume 1, as Chapter 30.]</p><p>Carlo Silvestro</p><p>(Swami Swatantra Sarjano) PANORAMA</p><p>MILAN, ITALY</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR MAGAZINE, WHICH IS A
WEEKLY MAGAZINE IN ITALY WITH A REPUTATION OF AN OPINION MAKER, LIKE
NEWSWEEK IN AMERICA. SINCE IT IS THE FIRST TIME ANY ITALIAN JOURNALIST
HAS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WE WILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF
QUESTIONS AND WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ALL OF THEM FOR OUR
READERS.</p><p>THE FIRST QUESTION IS: YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT A PROPHET, YOU ARE
NOT A MESSIAH, YOU ARE NOT A GOD, YOU ARE NOT A SAINT. SO WE WANT TO
KNOW, WHO ARE YOU?</p><p>ANSWER: Is it necessary for anyone to be a messiah, to be a prophet,
to be a son of God? Cannot one just be a human being? I am simply a
human being as everybody else is, with a very little difference: I am
awake and others are asleep. It may look like a great difference to the
person who is asleep, but to the awakened there is no difference at all.
Just a little shaking, shocking, and the asleep one will be awake and
they both can laugh at the whole stupid game of Master and disciple, of
messiah... of the savior and the saved. Except laughter there will be
nothing, because they will know that they are both exactly the same. And
because these names -- prophet, messiah, incarnation of God -- have been
used in the past to exploit people, to create bondage for their spirits,
for their psyches, these names have divided people into different
religions and the result was thousands of wars. Five thousand wars in
three thousand years... crusades in the name of God, people killing
thousands of other people, burning people alive in the name of God, and
with the authority that they are the representative of the messiah or
the prophet or the successor.</p><p>I don't want to be in this company of criminals. I want simply to be
an ordinary human being -- that's what I am.</p><p>Q: IN ANY CASE, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE A BIG POWER?</p><p>A: I don't have any power. I have love, big love, but love knows no
power. Power is desired by those who are incapable of love. Only the
loveless become politicians, power hungry. They think that if they have
power over people perhaps their desire for love will be fulfilled. It is
never fulfilled. No politician dies contented. It is impossible -- he
has gone wrong from the very beginning. The path of power leads farther
away from yourself, and from love. The path of love brings you closer
home to yourself</p><p>I have immense love to give, inexhaustible love to give, but no power
to order or command or tell somebody to be this, be that. I don't give
any ten commandments.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY HAVE YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE A GUEST HERE? DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE,
TO TRAVEL?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I have always been a guest wherever I was, because I belong to
the whole universe. So anywhere I am, that particular place is only a
guest house. I am not planning to leave -- I never plan. I can leave any
moment, I may not leave ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID, "I MUST CHOOSE, I PREFER TO BE ZORBA RATHER THAN
BUDDHA." WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</p><p>A: It means that Zorba is the foundation and Buddha is the palace.
Buddha is the peak, but the foundation stones are laid by Zorba. It will
be foolish to choose to be a Buddha without having the foundation
stones.</p><p>I am absolutely mathematical about it: Zorba should be there and the
stronger a Zorba is there, the better a Buddha is possible. So I can
become Buddha any moment, Zorba is absolutely needed as the basic energy
out of which the Buddha is going to be carved. Zorba is the marble rock
out of which the Buddha statue has to be carved. I choose the rock...
and Buddha is easy.</p><p>It is just a question of opening your eyes. I don't bother about
Buddha; I am worried about people who are not Zorbas. How will they
become Buddhas? They don't have the basic material out of which a Buddha
is made.</p><p>And this poverty has been given to people by our religious leaders.
They have been told not to be materialists. They have been told to be
celibate. They have been told to live in poverty. They have been told
that life is out of sin. All these things have destroyed their Zorbas.
Otherwise, every man is a born Zorba the Greek.</p><p>And if everything goes according to me, every man will die as Zorba
the Buddha. Between the Greek and the Buddha there is not much distance,
but first you must be the Greek.</p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH
PEOPLE? ARE YOU AS RICH AS MANY OF YOUR SANNYASINS? YOUR CRITICS -- AND
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- SAY THAT YOU COLLECT MONEY JUST AS YOU
COLLECT THE ROLLS ROYCES AND THE WATCHES. ARE YOU AGAINST THE POOR?</p><p>A: First, I collect nothing. There is not a single thing that I
possess. For thirty years I have been the poorest man in the world. And
on the judgment day, if there is a line you will find me in the front,
ahead of Jesus Christ.</p><p>But my people who love me are there. That is my possession, that
makes me rich. Their love is more to me than power over the whole world.
I would not like to become Alexander the Great. Out of their love,
whatsoever they want to do, they do.</p><p>If they want me to have Rolls Royces, they are free. If they want me
to have diamond watches, they are free. They know my taste, and for that
simple reason my people can manage to offer me everything that not even
a king or queen is capable of having.</p><p>The reason is very simple: whatever I teach can be understood only by
the very intelligent and creative people. So only the cream of
intelligence comes close to me.</p><p>I am against poverty and against the poor. I don't want any poverty,
any poor people in the world. I am not in agreement with Jesus that the
poor are the blessed; they are the cursed, they shall inherit the
kingdom of hell. There is no need for anybody to be poor. We have enough
intelligence, we have everything that can make the whole earth a
beautiful garden. But politicians will not allow it to happen; priests
will not allow it to happen, because if the garden of Eden can be
created here, then what is going to happen to their paradise, their God,
their hell and all the business that goes on around those bogus words
which mean nothing?</p><p>Politicians would not like that there are no poor people in the
world. If there are no poor people in the world, communism will lose all
hold immediately. If there are no poor people in the world, it will not
be easy for the capitalists to exploit anybody. In the capitalist
countries, the capitalist wants there to be poor people because they can
be purchased easily. In India you can purchase any vote for two rupees;
that is the highest price for any vote. Now what kind of democracy can
exist where you can purchase a vote for two rupees?</p><p>The rich people want the poor to exist, the priest wants the poor to
exist, because without the poor, who is going to go to the church? The
rich people have their Rotary Clubs, their Lion's Clubs, the Club of
Rome -- who is going to the church? The priest wants the crippled,
retarded, blind, sick, old, starving, all kinds of people who are not
wanted at all. The priest needs them; otherwise, who is going to gather
around Billy Graham?</p><p>If there are not orphans, who is going to give a Nobel prize to
Mother Teresa? These people are exploiting. With all the scientific and
technological developments in the twentieth century, I am saying that it
is absurd to allow poverty to exist for even a single moment more.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE'VE BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS NOW AND THE COMMUNE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL
AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL. YOUR WORDS ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL, TOO.
WHAT I AM ASKING MYSELF NOW IS, HOW COME THE PRESS AND THE OREGONIANS
ARE SO UNUSUALLY AGGRESSIVE AGAINST YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because I want them to be aggressive. They are simply following my
wishes. If they are not aggressive, then there is not much hope. If they
are aggressive, we can put them right.</p><p>Their being aggressive is their first step towards friendship. They
may not understand, but I understand it. For my whole life I have been
creating enemies and turning enemies into friends. And in fact it is
better this way, rather than vice-versa: you put all your energy into
creating a friend and then he becomes your enemy. That is sheer wastage.
The better thing is to put your whole energy into creating enemies, and
then let them turn into your friends. And they are bound to turn,
because whatsoever they are carrying is absurd. The moment they come to
know the truth, they will become your friends.</p><p>And it is a simple psychology: the deeper their hate, the deeper will
be their love, in the same proportion. I do not believe in people like
Dale Carnegie. I work just in the opposite way, and you can see my
business is succeeding. And where is Dale Carnegie? And how many people
has he turned into friends?</p><p>I want the whole earth, the whole humanity to be divided in two camps
-- no more Russian, no more American -- either they hate me or they love
me, but both ways they are connected with me, and I love both of them.
They are like the two wheels the bullock cart moves on; they are not
aware that they are playing into my hands.</p><p>Q: YOU SAID, "I AM A SIMPLE MAN." BUT WHY DO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE, SIMPLE MEN, FOLLOW A SIMPLE MAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because it is very difficult to find a simple man. Nobody is
simple, everybody thinks himself extraordinary. He may not have the guts
to say it -- that's another matter -- but everybody, deep down, thinks
himself to be the most superior, the most beautiful, the most
intelligent person in the world. And if he is not succeeding, it is
because the whole world is hostile to him, everybody is preventing him.
Otherwise, he would be on top of Everest.</p><p>I am a simple man with no ambition to be anybody other than I am, and
these people have been attracted towards me just because of my
simplicity, humanity.</p><p>They have fallen in love with an innocent man who has no secrets and
no privacy, who is absolutely open, available.</p><p>You cannot find people open, available, innocent, simple. Even the
most idiotic people think they are great geniuses. I am not a genius,
just an average, ordinary person.</p><p>Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF PERSONAL STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE, ANY
MESSAGE TO LEAVE? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF RAJNEESHISM AND RAJNEESHPURAM
AFTER YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUCCESSOR?</p><p>A: No, because all the religions who have followed those lines have
turned poisonous, have turned into curses on humanity. I don't want to
be a curse to humanity. I am a blessing and I want to remain a
blessing.</p><p>So nobody is going to succeed me.</p><p>And my message for my people is that the moment I am gone, your
religion is gone. Then whatever remains is just a corpse. Don't start
worshipping the corpse. I am a free man and I want every sannyasin to be
a free man. My love is the only binding force between them; otherwise,
there is no theology, no belief system, no agreement on anything.</p><p>Only one thing is keeping them together around the world, and that is
their love for me. When I am not there, nothing can keep them together.
There is no bridge. Each sannyasin is individually connected to me. You
don't ask the sun, "If one day you stop rising, what is going to happen
to the rays?" You know that the rays will not be there the moment I am
dead and gone.</p><p>They have lived with me, they have danced with me, they have enjoyed
with me</p><p>-- now they know the secret of how to enjoy life, how to live life.
And there is no need to go on making a church, popes, successors...
because they have done so much harm. I will not allow my people to do
that.</p><p>When I am gone, then you disperse. What is the point? my love was
keeping you together, and I am no more there. It is good that I am no
more, because now your last attachment is also dropped. I was the last
attachment to be broken, now you are totally free. You were free from
your family, from your nation, from your religion, but a small thin
thread of love was binding you with me. Now I am no more there; I give
you the last, the final taste of freedom.</p><p>And then whatever happens, happens. I am not responsible for it. The
people who will be coming after me will have the responsibility. And I
never think about the future. I am so totally involved with the
present... I am talking to you, and at this moment only you exist for
me. The whole space has disappeared and the whole time has stopped. Just
you and me... only then can there be some communication.</p><p>And I don't think about what is going to happen tomorrow. I am not
thinking what you are going to write about me, and I am not going to
read it, whatever</p><p>you write! It doesn't matter at all. What matters is that we enjoyed
this moment together, loved this moment, laughed together, felt each
other's humanity.</p><p>I cannot see anybody as a journalist, as a doctor, as an engineer.
Those are not your realities, they are just your jobs. When I look at
you, I put aside your journalist, I am talking directly to you.
Journalism is just your way of earning bread and butter. What importance
does it have? I cannot love bread and butter, but I love you as a
person, as an individual, and whatsoever I am saying is totally
different from what you would have found in the past with the many other
people you have interviewed. Even in the future you may not come across
a man like me.</p><p>My whole interest in this moment is how to help you enjoy the time
you have been with me. Your magazine, your writing, does not come
between me and you, so when you started introducing the magazine, I was
going to stop you, but just out of politeness I listened. What concern
do I have with magazines, newspapers?</p><p>My concern is purely with the individual, and then it is up to him.
Whatsoever he wants to make out of it, he will make out of it. I trust
in my love, and I trust in the dignity of the individual that is sitting
before me, and the trust will take care of everything. I never think of
tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE
SANNYASINS LIVING HERE, FOR THE LIFE AND THE FUTURE OF THE CHILDREN I
HAVE SEEN IN THIS CITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not responsible for anybody. I am not even a member of this
commune. I live outside the City of Rajneeshpuram. And I am not a
sannyasin, as you can see. It is the commune's responsibility. I am very
irresponsible.</p><p>When I was leaving the university, one girl used to love me. But just
the way girls are -- and particularly in India -- she was shy, and I am
not the one to chase anybody. I do chasing sitting in my chair... I am
just a lazy man. She loved me; and continuously she was sending messages
to me. She wanted to get married to me. Then the day of departure came
and we were leaving. We had passed our final examinations and then she
could not contain it any more.</p><p>She pulled me aside and told me, "I have loved you for two years, but
I had not the courage to say it. And you are a strange man... I made so
many efforts and so many messages, and you just remained as if I am not
here."</p><p>I said, "You do not know. It is just out of compassion that I have
remained that way, because I am a very irresponsible man. I may marry
you, and tomorrow morning I may forget all about you. I may give birth
to children and then I will not bother at all what happens to you and
your children."</p><p>Just out of compassion, I kept out of it. It is enough that I am
carrying my own responsibility towards myself That's why I have never
accepted any responsibility for anything.</p><p>India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wanted me to join
politics. I was introduced to him by India's very old seniormost
parliamentarian, who had been a member of parliament from 1916 up to
1976. He was known as the father of the Indian parliament. Jawaharlal
used to stay at his palace -- his father was given the title of rajah,
king, so his house had become the palace, and it was palatial.</p><p>And Jawaharlal was a man of tremendous intelligence. He talked just
for five to ten minutes with me and he said, "You'd better join
politics. You don't waste your time here and there, you have a great
future and I am with you and I will support you."</p><p>I said, "Thank you for your generosity, but I am not going to be in
any position where I am responsible for anybody."</p><p>Politics means responsibility, and if you are not responsible you
have to become a hypocrite. That's what all the politicians have become.
They talk about being responsible and nobody is responsible.</p><p>Now, millions of tons of food in Europe have been thrown in the
ocean, but they will not send it to Ethiopia. One hundred thousand
dollars were needed to take it to the ocean, and they dumped it there --
fresh fruit, fresh food. But its presence was going to bring the prices
down, and that they would not like. And who cares about Ethiopia? And
why should anybody care?</p><p>In speeches, everybody will talk about Ethiopia and responsibility,
but the real face is totally different. The prime minister of India,
Rajiv Gandhi, is one of my friends. He is Jawaharlal's grandson. If I
had accepted Jawaharlal's offer, perhaps I would have been in his place.
He is selling wheat to other countries while half of India is starving
and dying.</p><p>And they go on talking about sympathy and compassion for the poor...
but he needs nuclear weapons. For that he needs money, and India has
only raw materials to sell. It has no technology, no high technology.
The poor man works his whole life producing wheat and dies starving
while the wheat will be sold to purchase uranium to make nuclear
weapons.</p><p>I don't take anybody's responsibility. In this way I help whoever
comes close to me to be responsible for himself. People who take others'
responsibility are responsible for creating retarded, dependent slaves
all around the world. If nobody had taken their responsibility, they
would have taken the challenge of life and struggled for themselves.</p><p>I have heard about a very super-rich woman. She had come to a holiday
resort, to the best hotel. Her boy, who looked perfectly young and
healthy, was carried from the car on a stretcher. Even the hotel manager
and others thought that there must be something wrong. The young man
looked perfectly healthy, in the best of health. They said, "What is
wrong with this young man? What has happened?" She said, "Nothing has
happened, but he can afford to be carried on a stretcher. Why should he
walk?"</p><p>Now, this woman thinks she is making the life of the boy luxurious,
but she is crippling him. He may become crippled, he may not ever be
able to walk. Somebody took the whole responsibility.</p><p>It is a known fact that in the whole history of humanity, not a
single genius has come from superrich families. And the reason is
simple. All that he wanted was available, there was no challenge. When
there is no challenge intelligence goes out of function, it is not
needed.</p><p>It is strange. It should have been otherwise. The richer people
should have given birth to better geniuses, better Einsteins, better
painters, musicians, poets, but they have just given birth to
buffalos.</p><p>I don't take anybody's responsibility, because I love people and I
have compassion enough not to take their responsibility on my shoulders.
They have to take their own responsibility.</p><p>Q: I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO OUR READERS WHO THE SANNYASINS ARE. IS THE
SANNYASIN A SORT OF NEW MAN? YOU SAY THAT THE SANNYASINS ARE INNOCENT
CHILDREN. YOUR CRITICS SAY THAT THEY ARE YOUR SLAVES, SLAVES OF YOUR
ATTITUDE TOWARDS WORK, LIFE, LOVE, SEX. MAY WE HAVE YOUR OPINION OF THE
SANNYASINS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't care at all what the critics say. They all can go to hell
-- the sooner the better. But I can tell you about my sannyasins.</p><p>I don't have any dogma that they can follow. I have no philosophy
that they can live. I don't have any catechism that they have to repeat
and cram.</p><p>Being with me, all that happens is a very delicate deprogramming, and
once a person is deprogrammed I don't have any program for him. In fact,
my sannyasins are simply losing what they have, and I am not going to
replace it with with anything. They will lose Christianity, they will
lose Hinduism, and I will not replace it with another program. I will
leave them to themselves.</p><p>They are not my slaves; neither am I their slave. Slavery is a very
strange phenomenon, it is a double-edged sword. The master is dependent
on the slaves as much as the slaves are dependent on the masters.</p><p>I am nobody's slave, nobody is my slave, because I know that if you
create a slave, you become a slave immediately. My sannyasins cannot
even expect anything from me for the simple reason that I never expect
anything from them. When I said that I am not celibate because I am not
unnatural, a few sannyasins were shocked. They started writing letters
to me, and I informed them that they cannot have any expectations about
me. I can do anything I want. We don't have any contract that I will
follow your expectations or you will follow mine.</p><p>I have no contract of any kind. My sannyasins cannot expect what I am
going to do tomorrow. I can do anything, and they also are absolutely
free. They can do anything they want: they can be here, they can leave.
It is their freedom.</p><p>Out of freedom they have become sannyasins, out of freedom they can
become non-sannyasins. There is no problem. It is not a church and it is
not some contract which has always existed between the leader and the
follower, the Master and the disciple. But this delicate thing is rarely
understood -- that they both become dependent on each other.</p><p>I am reminded of a beautiful story about Diogenes. Greece has given a
few beautiful people to the world, but none comparable to Diogenes. He
is not much mentioned in the history of philosophies or even if he is
mentioned, it is only in the footnotes -- for the simple reason that the
man was so rebellious and such an outsider that the professors of
philosophy would find it difficult to explain the man and his
behavior.</p><p>He lived naked. Now, in India it is a tradition, there are many naked
sannyasins. But in Greece, he was the only one in the whole of history
who lived naked. Just like Buddha in India, he used to carry a begging
bowl to beg food or to drink water.</p><p>One day he was thirsty. It was hot and he was rushing towards the
river to fill his begging bowl with cool water. Just before he was going
to dip his begging bowl, a dog came running in and started drinking. He
stopped, for a moment he thought, and he said, "This dog seems to be
more independent than me. I have to depend on this begging bowl. If a
dog can manage without a begging bowl, then Diogenes is going to manage
it, too."</p><p>He immediately threw the begging bowl into the river. Even in small
things -- what to say about human beings -- when you make human beings
your slave, you are entering into a mutual slavery, a mutual
dependence.</p><p>I have no contract with my people. I have not promised them that I
should be this or that, so they can never question my behavior. I remain
individual; and that's what I want them to remain, individual.</p><p>Now, the persons who were shocked when I said I am not celibate had
carried the idea for centuries that a religious person should be
celibate -- and particularly nobody has heard that an enlightened man
had made love to any woman after his enlightenment. Naturally they were
shocked.</p><p>It is up to them. They can think that perhaps I am not enlightened.
Perhaps it is time for them to leave this place. Perhaps they have come
to a wrong person. But as far as I am concerned, I am going to be
totally free, absolutely frank, no secrecy, no privacy.</p><p>I know for certain that celibacy is unnatural unless you are
impotent; and I don't think any impotent person has ever become
enlightened. No, there is no mention of it. In fact, just the opposite
is the case. The people who became enlightened were really too much
sexual, that's why I call them Zorbas; they were really too much sexual
-- so much that finally they understood that there is nothing much in
it. They experienced it through and through and found nothing in it. And
that was the point from where they started searching for something else.
That led them towards Buddhahood, enlightenment.</p><p>But once they had become enlightened -- they were fulfilling people's
expectations because they wanted to be great enlightened Masters,
prophets, messiahs -- they could go on fooling with women. Buddha would
not even look at a woman. What cowardliness! Buddha would not allow any
woman close to him, she had to remain eight feet away.</p><p>Is this enlightenment? so afraid, so shaky that even a woman coming
close and you become afraid? This is repression, this is not
enlightenment.</p><p>I want to declare to the whole world that unenlightened people can
have only sexual relationships, which they call love. This is not right.
They should stop calling it making love; they are simply making sex.
Only an enlightened person can make love, because it is no more his
need. He can be without it for years and not even for a single moment
will he feel its need. But he can enjoy it as fun.</p><p>I can play cards; it is not a need. I can drink once in a while; it
does not disturb my enlightenment. I can make love. I don't see... but
it can disturb people's idea of enlightenment. That is their business.
My enlightenment is not made of such fragile matter. It cannot be
disturbed by anything. In fact, they have been asking whether
enlightened people transcend sex, and I have sent the answer to them
that the enlightened person finally transcends enlightenment, too.</p><p>And I have transcended enlightenment, too. Now I am again the same
old ordinary man I was before all this round trip jet journey. I am back
home.</p><p>I have passed through everything, all meditation, all enlightenment,
and come back home, with new eyes, new clarity, new vision. It is almost
like living continuously on LSD.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY ARE SO MANY WOMEN SANNYASINS?</p><p>A: Because I am a man, and it is natural for women to be attracted to
me. You can see my grey beard. This beautiful grey beard is the work of
the ladies. The whole credit goes to them; otherwise, I would be having
a black beard by this time. But so many ladies... but I don't bother
about the color of the beard -- the grey is so beautiful!</p><p>Q: IT SEEMS THE WHOLE COMMUNE IS RUN BY WOMEN. IS THERE A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR STRATEGY TO THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly there is a particular strategy. Man has dominated women
for centuries and forced the idea on them that they are the weaker sex,
that they cannot do anything that man can do. They can do small homely
things -- that is their world. I want to destroy that idea completely.
And you can see I have destroyed it.</p><p>My communes are run by women, and they have proved far superior to
men in every possible way. My sannyasins are doing better business than
any man can do, finding better bargains than any man can find. I wanted
it to be a solid</p><p>argument before the whole of humanity that women are not inferior,
that if you give them a chance, they can even prove superior in many
matters. At least they are going to prove equal.</p><p>And this is a strange way: to keep half of humanity in a downtrodden
state. How much is the loss? -- half of humanity means that women, if
they were accepted equally, would have produced a Dostoevsky, a
Turgenev, a Chekhov, a Gorky, a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Nijinsky. They
may have proved a Buddha, a Jesus. Half</p><p>of humanity! -- it is a vast ocean to whom you have denied all
possibilities of creation, expression. And you have behaved with women
as if they are cattle, not human beings.</p><p>It is not going to be so in my commune.</p><p>But I do not agree with the liberation movement of women, because
that is going in a reactionary way, creating hate for men -- so much so
that their basic approach is now that no woman should love any man, that
they should all be lesbians.</p><p>Here, women are running the whole commune, everything, but no man who
is here has ever felt that he is inferior. In fact, for the first time
he feels a respect for women. He can see the dignity of women. Every day
I receive letters from my male sannyasins asking, "What is happening?
The commune sannyasins, the women, are becoming juicier and juicier,
more and more graceful, more and more beautiful. And they are working so
hard!"</p><p>For the first time, they have been given the chance to show their
mettle. It is not a loss to men: they have found a companion, equal to
themselves, side by side with them.</p><p>You were missing half of humanity.… And remember, because you have
repressed that half, that half was trying to take revenge in every
possible way. Of course, the woman has her own ways of taking revenge,
and every man knows how the woman can take revenge. Every woman has been
taking it for centuries. She will be nagging the husband, she will be
spying on the husband. She will make the husband just a henpecked
person.</p><p>All husbands are henpecked! I have never come across another
category. Outside they may roar like lions, but that is not to be
believed. Just look through the keyhole in their houses -- the woman is
roaring and the husband is hiding like a rat behind this chair, behind
that table. It is natural, because if you repress their energy, somehow
they are going to revolt against it. Here, men also are feeling
tremendously relieved because no woman is nagging them.</p><p>Women's liberation is automatically men's liberation. Women's slavery
is automatically men's slavery. They go together.</p><p>But this is only a transitory period.… Once I have proved my point,
all around the world in different countries and different communes --
even where I am not present -- women will be on the top, once the point
is proved and people can see. Just four years ago, when we came here, we
did not have a single dollar. My women sannyasins managed to purchase
126 square miles, an area three times</p><p>bigger than New York. In four years we have poured almost two hundred
million dollars into creating this oasis, and all has been managed by
women. They have proved their mettle -- and without insulting men,
without putting them down, without in any way taking revenge. And they
are not lesbians.</p><p>So it is, in fact, a tremendous revolution which is needed, which has
been needed for centuries. And the sooner the whole world goes the way
my communes function, the better, because I don't think women will be
ready to use nuclear weapons in the third world war. Women won't want to
kill; that is not part of their feminine psychology. They would like
people to come closer, to be more loving.</p><p>If the world is run by women -- and man can take his place more
significantly in scientific research, in the service of life and
creativity -- and the governments and all other functional things are
run by women, we will have a tremendous balance.</p><p>It will take a little time for women to produce Einstein and Picasso
and Michelangelo. It will take a little time to bring a Mozart, a
Leonardo da Vinci, because for thousands of years -- in fact, for the
whole history -- they have been repressed, so it will need a little
time. And once the repression changes into expression, it will be just
like land which has been lying fallow for thousands of years gathering
all kinds of fertilizers, rain water, and nobody cultivating it. When
you cultivate it, it is going to give you a bumper crop. All other
fields will look poor because they have been exploited every year; they
have lost their energy to produce more.</p><p>The same is the situation of the human mind. The feminine mind has
not been used, has not been allowed to function. If it is allowed, it
may take a quantum leap. And it will be a blessing for all.</p><p>An intelligent woman, respected as equal to men in the society, will
not become a lesbian because it is unnatural, absolutely unnatural. She
will be heterosexual. And if all women turn to heterosexuality, we will
be declaring war on homosexuality, too, because from where are they
going to find men? They will chase the homosexuals to their deaths. They
are chasing them here. We have got a few homosexuals, and they go on
writing letters of complaint to me: "We are homosexuals and women are
chasing us. We are not interested, but we do not want even to declare
that we are homosexual." I say, "What can I do? Drop your
homosexuality."</p><p>We can make a better world together. Men and women should be really
half- and-half of a whole. There are qualities which men have and women
do not have; there are qualities which women have and men do not have.
Both together, the human being will be richer in every possible way.</p><p>Just think of a woman pilot dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. I cannot conceive of it. If there had been a woman pilot, she
would have refused to follow the order. She would have preferred to be
shot dead, but she would not go to kill innocent people who have nothing
to do with war.</p><p>And anyway, the war was ending. Germany was already on its knees, it
was only a question of a week or two until Japan would surrender. There
was no need of an atom bomb to create a hell for two beautiful
cities.</p><p>I don't think a woman could have done that. A woman would rather have
said, "You can court-martial me. You can shoot me. That seems to be
easier than killing 100,000 people in one city, and 120,000 people in
another city."</p><p>But what did the man pilot do? He dropped atom bombs on both the
cities, came back to his base, had a good dinner, smoked the best cigar,
joked with his friends, and went to sleep with a woman. In the morning
when the journalists reached him, they asked the man if it had been very
difficult for him to sleep having caused 220,000 people's deaths.</p><p>He said, "No, I slept beautifully. I did my duty, and once the duty
was fulfilled -- and it was a great duty to be fulfilled -- I was
feeling so happy that I managed to do it that I went to sleep with a
woman and had a beautiful sleep."</p><p>Because it had been his orders, President Truman was asked early in
the morning the next day, "How was your night?" He said, "I felt
immensely relieved. Now there is no question of the war being prolonged
any more. Not only that, we have made a point to the whole world: Don't
come in conflict with America, otherwise the result will be more
Hiroshimas, more Nagasakis" -- not a single word of sympathy for those
innocent people. They were civilians, they were not in military
camps.</p><p>I have seen a picture that I cannot forget. One friend from Japan
sent me a photograph of a small child, maybe eight or nine years old.
His bag hanging on his shoulder, his books in the bag, he was going
upstairs into the attic which was allotted to him as his place to study
and sleep. And just when he was on the middle of the staircase, the atom
bomb fell on Hiroshima. The boy simply got burned and got stuck into the
wall -- just a burned body with a burned bag, burned books.</p><p>When I saw that picture, I could not believe that man can do this to
man. If a woman was president of America, I don't think this could have
happened. Man has been given enough chance; now let the woman come up,
and man can pour his energies more into scientific fields. Meanwhile,
women will pick things up.</p><p>Yes, there is a certain basic strategy why my communes are run by
women. But you can meet my male sannyasins. They are not in any way
thought to be inferior. No woman is treating them as inferior in the way
they have always treated women as inferior.</p><p>Perhaps it is that the male ego functions in that way: unless it
makes somebody feel inferior, it is not satisfied. The woman functions
in a different way: unless she feels somebody needing her, desiring her,
she feels frustrated. A man's need seems to be to dominate, and the
woman's need seems to be to be needed. That is a far better need -- to
be needed.</p><p>And I am doing an experiment, I am not a philosopher. I hate
philosophy because it is simply a wastage of time. My commune is my
experiment, and</p><p>everything that I have envisioned has come true in it. The same can
happen all over the world. This is a prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU HAVE ALSO SAID, "WE ARE NOT MISSIONARIES." WHY? DON'T YOU WANT
MORE SANNYASINS?</p><p>A: We are not missionaries because we don't want anybody to be
converted into sannyasins by us. We are available for anybody who wants
to join us. He is welcome. We are receptive to anybody without
conditions, but we are not going after people like the Christian
missionaries or the Witnesses of Jehovah, forcing their Bible on you,
knocking on your doors every morning. We are not going to knock on
anybody's door.</p><p>Yes, we will spread the message -- that's why I am talking with you.
We will spread the message and if anybody wants to come with us and join
our caravan, we are perfectly happy.</p><p>But this is a very different approach from missionaries. It is not
aggressive, it is receptive; it is not masculine, it is feminine. That
is the difference I make between these two psychologies. The male
psychology is to go after the woman -- that is the missionary. The
woman's psychology is to escape from the missionary, but remain
receptive. She never escapes too much. She always remains within the
boundary so you can catch hold of her, but she lures by running away. By
running away she becomes more beautiful; by running away she becomes a
dream girl a very homely girl can become a dream girl.</p><p>I trust in the feminine psychology because these missionary types of
people around the world are aggressive. They are in a kind of war; very
subtle, but it is a war. They are in politics -- very subtle, but it is
a politics of numbers. What has the pope got that he should be
respected? I have seen his statements, which are not even his
statements, his secretary goes on writing them. Even then, all those
statements prove only a thick head. Nothing of importance ever comes out
of these popes.</p><p>And the missionaries I have been in touch with in India were of a
very high caliber -- men like Stanley Jones -- but the whole effort is
how to convert people into Christianity. What did Stanley Jones do? He
created a Christian ashram. To exploit Hindus, he used the word ashram.
He managed his ashram just the way Hindus live in their ashrams: getting
up early in the morning, going to the Ganges for the bath, then going to
the church to pray. Every ritual of the Hindus was copied.</p><p>The only difference was that Krishna was missing, and there was
Christ. And that is not much of a difference because there are scholars
who say that Christ never existed, it is just another name for Krishna.
I was looking at how Krishna can become Christ in Indian languages, and
then I came across Bengali: in Bengali, Krishna is called Christo. Now
that comes very close to Christ.</p><p>There are scholars who think there has never been any Christ, it was
just that the story of Krishna, changing through many forms, finally
took this Aramaic transformation; and Christianity was born out.of a
borrowed myth.</p><p>I asked Stanley Jones, "Can't you see your diplomacy? Whom do you
want to deceive?" He used to wear Hindu clothes. In his ashram,
everybody used to wear Hindu clothes. Nobody could smoke there. No
alcohol was allowed. But the whole point was somehow to attract Hindus
there, and then convert them.</p><p>This is aggression, violence. It is interfering into your inner
being. It is far worse than cutting off your head. At least I cut off
your head without changing you. I respect you as you are and cut off
your head. They don't cut your head, but they destroy your mind, they
reprogram you. They replace Krishna with Christ, they put a cross in
place of a flute -- which is an ugly replacement.</p><p>The flute is life-affirming and the cross is death-oriented. No
Jonestown could have ever happened under Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism. It
is impossible. A Jonestown needed absolutely a Christian context. It
needed a cross.</p><p>And Reverend Jim Jones was doing exactly the same foolishness that
Jesus did. He was simply following step by step. Jesus had told his
people that they would be coming with him into the kingdom of God. Of
course, he would be going first to make arrangements for them. And for
two thousand years he has been making arrangements -- and the idiots are
still waiting.</p><p>Jim Jones was more contemporary. He thought it better to take the
whole lot, the whole congregation with him. Why should he go first and
prepare the ground? -- and then Jesus has not been heard from for two
thousand years. Perhaps people are not allowed to come back here; it
seems to be better to take everybody with.… This could happen only in a
Christian context.</p><p>If women are leaders in politics, leaders in science, leaders in
poetry, painting, they will bring a totally new perspective to
everything. Women should be professors, educationists, they should be
everywhere. They are half of the world</p><p>-- they own half the world. And my experience here is that they are
tremendously capable, reliable. You can trust them more because they
connect with you not from the head, but from the heart.</p><p>Q: YOU SAY YOU CAN'T COEXIST WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. DO YOU WANT
A RED OREGON, A RED WORLD? AND ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR THIS
PURPOSE?</p><p>A: We never plan anything, but we are always ready to fight for human
rights. Whatever the consequence, we will fight for democracy. We will
fight for freedom. We will fight for respect towards the individual. We
will fight for America and will not allow Americans to destroy its
beauty, its Constitution, its Declaration of Independence. We are on the
side of America, and the Oregonians are not. That is my basic
standpoint.</p><p>We have not committed a single crime, we have not done anything
illegal. We have not done anything against the Constitution, and the
State of Oregon has done everything against the Constitution, against
the law. They have used the law in a way it has never been used against
anybody. They have taken advantage of the loopholes in the law.</p><p>But my commune is not Reverend Jim Jones' uneducated black people. My
commune has four hundred law experts. There is no other firm in the
whole world which has four hundred law experts.</p><p>We are going to fight to the very end. And remember, we are fighting
for the values America stands for, and they are fighting against their
own values, their own Constitution, their own law.</p><p>They are fascists, and I don't think fascism can win. We are a small
minority, but we are not threatened by them; they are a big majority,
and they are threatened by us. You can see clearly what is the
reason.</p><p>The reason is that we are standing for their Constitution, and they
are going against their own Constitution. In the courts they are getting
defeated everywhere. In the lower courts perhaps they may succeed,
because they belong to the state, they are under the pressure of the
state; but as we move higher, our number of wins gets bigger.</p><p>The moment we are in the federal courts, we immediately win. And I am
absolutely certain I myself am going to stand in the Supreme Court of
America to save the Constitution of America against all those who want
to prostitute it.</p><p>Is it a Constitution or a prostitution?</p><p>We are not threatened, we are really enjoying the whole game.
Anything more?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE LAST QUESTION! ONCE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A HOLOCAUST BETWEEN 1984

interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH PENNY ALLEN, FREELANCE JOURNALIST, SISTERS, OREGON</p><p>QUESTION:* I HAVE READ THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE ENLIGHTENMENT
AVAILABLE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. NOW I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU'RE
SAYING THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NOT ALL ITS CRACKED UP TO BE, AND THAT YOU
WANT TO BE NORMAL. WHAT'S HAPPENING?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: Enlightenment is only the beginning; there is infinity to go
for. Enlightenment is only a door, and then there is an unending
existence, an unending evolution, expansion.</p><p>The people who are unconscious, for them enlightenment is the goal;
they are not aware of the fact that enlightenment is only a door. Once
you have reached it, then a new kind of pilgrimage starts. Up to this
door, you were an entity. Beyond this door, you will not be an entity.
You will be just pure consciousness without a body, without a mind; you
will be just a fragrance which will go on spreading all over
existence.</p><p>And the fragrance is luminous. It is full of awareness. It knows
itself and it knows the whole existence around it -- not as separate,
but part, a kind of at-one- ment. It is the universe, and the universe
is it; there is no division, no duality.</p><p>Now the observer becomes the observed; the seer becomes the seen. He
is both. It is difficult to explain to people who have not even thought
about the door, whose lives go on like sleepwalkers, somnambulists. They
live, but at the very minimum level without any intensity, without any
totality.</p><p>And this calamity has happened because of a few vested interests. The
priest, the politician, all those who have been in power. They never
wanted man to be awake, because if humanity consists of awakened
individuals, there is not going to be any Christianity. There is not
going to be any Hinduism. there is not going to be any American, and
Russian, any German. There is not going to be the white man and the
black man; there is not going to be man the superior and woman the
inferior. All these stupidities will disappear.</p><p>For the awakened man, the whole existence is one. Not only this
earth, but now he is joined with the stars, too. And in his vision the
smallest blade of grass is as significant and important to existence as
the biggest star millions of light years away.</p><p>The priest does not want people to be awake because they can be
exploited only when they are asleep. The politician does not want people
to be awake; otherwise, they will not be democrats, republicans,
socialists and communists. They will be individuals intelligent and
conscious enough to decide for themselves. They will not need parties
and religions and cults and all their struggles and squabbles.</p><p>The vested interests have kept man almost drugged. I don't agree with
Karl Marx on any other point, but on one point I absolutely agree with
him -- religion is the opium of the people. On that point also I have my
reservations.</p><p>First, he was only aware of Western religions: Judaism -- he was a
Jew; Christianity -- which is an offshoot of Judaism; and a little bit
of Islam -- that, too, is an offshoot of Judaism. He had no knowledge
about the Eastern religions: Buddhism, Jainism, Tao, Zen. They were
unknown dimensions to him.</p><p>Secondly, he was not aware he could not be aware, of me and my people
-- we were not yet there -- and a totally new quality of religion which
I call religiousness. Not religion, but religiousness; no God, but
godliness. I change every noun, every pronoun into a verb because
existence is a verb, it is not a noun. It is continuously growing,
flowing, expanding.</p><p>Now physicists say that the stars you see in the night are
continuously running farther away from the center. We don't know where
the center is; we don't know where they are going, and the speed is
immense -- 186,000 miles per second. With that speed, although the stars
are going farther and farther away, this continuous growth needs not
static things but growing things.</p><p>That's why you will find so many contradictions in me. I have never
stopped anywhere. I have been going in absolute tune with existence,
wherever it leads. And if it contradicts my yesterdays, it is perfectly
okay. They are dead anyway.</p><p>I am happy that I am in tune in the present moment. I am happy that I
know the secret of being in the present, because time has no other
tense. It is always now. And once you know the secret of being in the
now, you have known the greatest mystery of existence.</p><p>But the people who are in power would like human beings to remain
involved and occupied with very stupid things -- communism, socialism,
this party, that party, Christianity, Hinduism. The people are burdened
with their own problems. They, too, are mostly created.</p><p>For example, marriage is a problem created by the priests. It is
unnatural, it has not happened naturally. Now the man is being nagged by
the wife; the wife is being continuously put down by the man. Then there
are children. And the Pope and Mother Teresa go on telling people that
these children are sent by God, so don't use any birth control methods
-- that's sin.</p><p>So people have dozens of children, thousands of worries. How to bring
them up? How to educate them? We have made a world for human beings so
difficult, and on top of it there is hell. If you just slip a little
bit, you fall into eternal hell. For small things. And there is paradise
luring you with all those things every religion condemns here on earth.
And the saints are enjoying all those things there.</p><p>I have heard a story of a Zen Master. He was always teaching his
disciples that celibacy is categorical. Without it, you cannot enter
into nirvana, the kingdom of God. The poor disciples were trying hard to
be celibate. It is really doing something unnatural, almost impossible.
They were all feeling guilty. And then the Master died. His last words
were, "Remember celibacy is the foundation of religion."</p><p>After a few days, one of the disciples died, and the moment he
entered paradise he was so full of joy that now he would be meeting his
Master. He had been with the Master for thirty, forty years.</p><p>He saw the Master sitting by the bank of a beautiful river under the
shadow of a very huge and ancient tree, with a beautiful naked woman
sitting in his lap. The disciple could not believe his eyes. Still just
out of old habit, he fell in the Master's feet and asked, "What is
happening? What happened to celibacy?" The Master said, "You will always
remain an idiot! This is the reward for all my celibacy. Now I can enjoy
as many women as I want, and here no woman grows old, no woman
perspires, no woman has menstrual periods. You cannot improve upon the
women that are available here. Their very body is fragrant; they don't
use French perfumes." But the poor disciple was at a loss. It was such a
shock.</p><p>This is the situation of all the religions. All the things that they
deny to people here, they will give a million times more as a reward in
paradise. Naturally, the poor human being is pulled. To be, or not to
be? To enjoy a woman here or to wait just a few years more and enjoy as
many women as you want for eternity. No marriage happens in heaven; all
marriages happen in the churches. And they say that marriage is made in
heaven, but in heaven there are no couples, only individuals.</p><p>The poor man is pulled apart. His fear of hell represses him; his
greed for heaven represses him. With so many problems of day to day
living he has no time to think of enlightenment. He has no time to think
that there is anything more than this miserable world.</p><p>And this is a created situation, because only in such a situation can
you keep them enslaved. You can send them to Vietnam to kill innocent
people without any hate. You can send your pilots to destroy Hiroshima
and Nagasaki within seconds without any feeling. You have turned people
into robots. Millions of people around the earth are in the armies, just
functioning like robots. And those who are not in the armies are also
imprisoned in some kind of social, political, religious ideology. It is
so difficult to find an individual who is clean, completely clean.</p><p>And that's my whole effort: to create a complete clean human being,
unburdened of the past, unburdened of any guilt. unburdened of fear and
greed, unburdened of politicians and priests. Just clean, so clean that
he becomes a mirror. And in that mirror, you see for the first time
where the door is. In that mirror, the door reflects.</p><p>Just as our eyes are mirrors in which things reflect -- we find where
the table is and where the chair is because our two eyes are mirroring
things around us -- when a man is completely clean, silent, serene, his
inner being becomes a mirror and the inward door that was always there
is reflected in it. And the magnetism of the door is such that once one
has seen it, there is no way to escape from it.</p><p>You start moving toward that door the way a moth moves toward a flame
knowing perfectly that coming closer to the flame he is going to be
burned, he is going to die. But some strange attraction, the moth is
ready to die.</p><p>The same is the situation when you see the door of enlightenment for
the first time. You become the moth and the door becomes the flame. You
know you are going to die; but at the same time you know that you are
going to be reborn on the other side.</p><p>This is resurrection.</p><p>Q:* IF I COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR PAST. WHEN YOU</p><p>WERE LOOKING FOR THAT DOOR, YOU SPENT A YEAR WHEN YOU WERE MAD -- IN
WHICH YOU COULDN'T FORMULATE A SENTENCE -- AND YOU LOST YOUR
PERSPECTIVE. IS THIS CORRECT? IS THAT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
THAT DOOR?</p><p>A:* I have been looking for that door as long as I remember, from my
very childhood. I must have carried that idea from my past life because
I don't remember a single day in my childhood in this life that I was
not looking for it.</p><p>And as far as my craziness is concerned, naturally I was thought
crazy by everybody. I never played with any children. I never could find
any way to communicate with the children of my own age. To me, they
looked stupid, doing all kinds of idiotic things. I never joined any
football team, volleyball team, hockey team; of course, they all thought
me crazy. And as far as I was concerned, as I grew I started looking at
the whole world as crazy.</p><p>In the last year -- when I was twenty-one -- it was a time of nervous
breakdown and breakthrough. Naturally, those who loved me, my family, my
friends, my professors, could understand a little bit what was going on
in me -- why I was so different from other children, why I would go on
sitting for hours with closed eyes, why I sat by the bank of the river
and went on looking at the sky for hours, sometimes for the whole night.
Naturally the people who could not understand such things -- and I did
not expect them to understand -- thought me mad.</p><p>In my own home, I had become almost absent. I would be there in the
room and my mother would be asking me, "If you see someone in the house,
just tell me,</p><p>because I don't see anybody here and I have to send somebody to fetch
some fruits or some vegetable from the market." The market was not far
away, just two minutes walk; but I was not considered to be anybody.
They had accepted the fact that I was good for nothing.</p><p>And they were right. In the morning they would send me to purchase
something which was needed immediately and I would return in the night.
And then I would say, "I think you had sent me for something, but I
completely forgot about it. If you remind me, I can run again." And they
said, "Please, excuse us that we sent you. Now if you go again, then the
whole night nobody knows when you will turn up."</p><p>By and by they stopped asking me anything, and slowly, slowly they
started feeling as if I were not there. And I loved it, the way I had
become a nothingness, a nobody, an absence.</p><p>That one year was tremendous. I was surrounded with nothingness,
emptiness. I had lost all contact with the world. If they reminded me to
take a bath, I would go on taking the bath for hours. Then they had to
knock on the door, "Now come out of the bathroom. You have taken enough
bath for one month. Just come out." If they reminded me to eat, I ate;
otherwise, days would pass and I would not eat. Not that I was fasting,
I had no idea about eating or fasting. My whole concern was to go deeper
and deeper into myself, and the door was so magnetic, the pull was so
immense -- like what physicists now call black holes.</p><p>They say there are black holes in existence. If a star comes by
chance to a black hole, it is pulled into the black hole. There is no
way to resist that pull, and to go into the black hole is to go into
destruction. We don't know what happens on the other side. My idea, for
which some physicist has to find evidence, is that the black hole on
this side is a white hole on the other side. The hole cannot be just one
side; it is a tunnel.</p><p>I have experienced it in myself. Perhaps on a bigger scale the same
happens in the universe. The star dies; as far as we can see, it
disappears. But every moment new stars are being born. From where? Where
is their womb?</p><p>It is simple arithmetic that the black hole was just a womb -- the
old disappeared into it, and the new is born. This I have experienced in
myself -- I am not a physicist. That one year of tremendous pull made me
farther and farther away from people; so much so, that I would not
recognize my own mother. I might not recognize my own father. So far
that there were times I forgot my own name. I tried hard, but there was
no way to find what my name used to be.</p><p>Naturally, for everybody that one year I was mad; but, to me, that
madness became meditation and the ultimate of that madness opened the
door.</p><p>I passed through it. I am now beyond enlightenment -- on the other
side of the door.</p><p>Q:* EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
DOOR, DO YOU STILL HAVE BLACK MOMENTS? FOR</p><p>EXAMPLE, THIS SPRING WHEN YOU STOPPED GIVING DISCOURSES FOR TWO
MONTHS, WHERE WERE YOU? WERE YOU IN THE BLACK HOLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. I have passed the black hole. Now I am always in the white
house. Presidents will come and go, but I am going to remain in the
white house all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU WERE SILENT FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AROUND
APRIL AND MAY OF THIS YEAR?</p><p>A:* Yes. I was sick at that time. I was not feeling fell, so I simply
rested. But I was not in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT WASN'T A LOSS OF PERSPECTIVE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, nothing. That cannot happen now. That is an
impossibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU HAVE SAID THAT HERE ON THE RANCH, IN THE BUDDHAFIELD, YOUR
SANNYASINS EXPERIENCE AND SHARE MOODS; THAT JOY IS CONTAGIOUS. DOES A
BAD MOOD EVER PASS THROUGH THE COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Just wait a minute. First let me finish your last question;
otherwise you will be in a difficulty to figure it out.</p><p>For three and a half years I was silent to sort out those people who
were hanging around my words, who were enchanted by my words, who loved
my voice, who loved the way I speak, I argue. But that is not my basic
function. I speak to help you to be silent. I say something so that you
can go beyond words.</p><p>I use words to help you to go into wordlessness. It is just like
having a thorn in the foot, with another thorn you pull it out. Your
mind is full of birds, so many and so much chattering, yakketty-yak,
yakketty-yak. It goes on and on.</p><p>But then, people became intoxicated with my words. That was not my
purpose. I continuously insisted, "Don't be concerned with my words; be
concerned with my silences, the gaps between the words, the gaps between
the lines."</p><p>Three years I remained silent. Those few remained hanging around for
a few months. Some managed to hang around for one or two years. Three
years was too much; by and by they all left me thinking that I was going
to remain silent forever. The day I saw that all those people who were
interested in my words but not in silence had left, it was time to
speak.</p><p>And this speaking is totally different from the speaking that was
there three and a half years ago. I was speaking to people who were
listening through the head. I was arguing, I was rationalizing, I was
doing everything to convince their heads. Now there is no need of that.
I have got people with whom I can talk heart to</p><p>heart. My words don't pass their heads. There is no scrutiny in their
heads when they hear my words. My words simply penetrate directly into
their hearts.</p><p>Albert Einstein has proved according to non-Euclidean geometry that
there are no straight lines in existence. He is right as far as
objective lines are concerned. Every line is a curve -- of a very big
circle, so you cannot see it as a curve -- if you go on drawing the line
on both ends, one day you will find that you have made a circle.</p><p>In existence there are no straight lines. If we draw a straight line
here on the floor, it looks absolutely straight, but it cannot be
because the earth is round. This small straight line is just a piece of
a vast round which goes around the earth.</p><p>Einstein is dead; otherwise I would have said to him that I know
there are lines which go straight, too. But those lines are not of
geometry, they are lines of love. I experience it every day. My being
and my sannyasins' beings are joined not by curved lines but by straight
lines. Now it is a totally different affair. I can say whatsoever I want
to say. Three and a half years ago I had to say things which people
wanted to hear. I had to drop a few things because they would not be
able to digest them. I had to impose interpretations on Jesus on
Krishna, on Buddha for the simple reason that if I impose that
interpretation on Jesus, I can have a certain communication with the
Christian. We can come close.</p><p>Now I have my own people so I don't take the trouble to interpret
Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Lao Tzu. On the contrary, all the
things that I left unsaid before my silence began I am saying now. And
the interpretations that I had managed through Jesus's mouth I am taking
back and putting Jesus in his own place.</p><p>So my work has really started now. Before the silent period, I was
just preparing the ground and finding the people who will be able to
remain with me in every climate, in every season, in every change. I am
not a thinker who remains consistent. Because I am an existential man
who moves with existence, only those who don't bother about what I said
yesterday can move with me. If today I am contradicting it, they don't
worry about it.</p><p>One thing is to be understood very clearly: to my sannyasins whatever
I am saying is not important; what is important is that I am saying it.
Whatever is being said has no significance; but in saying it on my part
and hearing it on their part, something else side by side with the words
has transferred.</p><p>Those words were just vehicles creating a way for something which
cannot be said, cannot be reduced to language at all. that's why they
are never concerned about contradictions. I am not creating a philosophy
or a theology. It is a religious field of experience.</p><p>Now, you were asking something. You can ask.</p><p>Q:* I ASKED ABOUT THE ENERGY FIELD HERE; AND I WAS WONDERING IF IT
EVER HAPPENED, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE NOT FEELING</p><p>WELL, THAT A MELANCHOLY CAUGHT ON? OR, IS THE ENERGY HERE ALWAYS
POSITIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It is always positive. My sickness is a physical thing; the
energy has nothing to do with my body. The energy is never sick. It is
never negative.</p><p>I mean the energy of an enlightened person is never negative. the
energy of an unenlightened person is always negative. The unenlightened
knows nothing of positive energy. He only reads books on positive
thinking and this and that. Idiots like Norman Vincent Peale go on
writing books on positive thinking, and millions of people read those
books thinking that perhaps by positive thinking they can become
millionaires, by positive thinking they can produce palaces. And they
don't bother about how many palaces Norman Vincent Peale has created.
They don't bother at all that Rockefeller has never read Peale, that
Henry Ford has no idea of Peale.</p><p>It is not a question of positive thinking. Positive thinking is
appealing only to negative people, because they know their negativity
continuously. But without enlightenment, you cannot have positive
energy. So I saw throw away all those books on positive thinking. They
are deluding you. They are giving you a sense as if without being
enlightened you can be positive. That is impossible.</p><p>Positivity is beyond the door of enlightenment. Negativity is on this
side. The night is on this side -- the black hole -- and the day is on
the other side where the sun never sets.</p><p>So as far as I am concerned, I am always overflowing with energy. My
body can be sick -- but that makes no difference to my innermost being;
it remains exactly the same. and whether I am speaking or silent, my
field is vibrating, is ready to welcome anybody who comes with an open
heart, is ready to receive into the innermost center of the energy field
one who is not resistant, not reluctant, but is ready, vulnerable, open,
is willing to risk.</p><p>There is a field already existing. And the moment you enter
Rajneeshpuram, you will feel a different air, a different milieu, a
different silence, a different loving energy all over the place. But
those who come with closed eyes and closed heart, those who come with
prejudices already determined with their conclusions -- naturally, they
come, they go, and they remain untouched by the immense energy that was
available, free.</p><p>I have been known around the world as the free sex guru. Now they
should change it because things have gone far beyond sex. Sex is energy,
the energy of the sleepy man. The moment a man becomes enlightened, the
same energy turns into a positive field. Now they should start calling
me the free energy guru, because I have traveled miles, and the go on
calling me something which I have left far behind.</p><p>Even if I die and my people can remain rejoicing, loving, the energy
field will remain. I cannot take it away with me. But if they start
being ordinary again, jealous, full of hate, hostility, violence, then
they will destroy the energy field.</p><p>I have created the energy field; now it is existing almost
independent of me. And my whole effort is that while I am alive I should
detach myself completely from the energy field and see whether my people
can manage it.</p><p>And that's what I am doing every day. I am giving more and more
responsibility to my people. I am sending people from one commune to
another. If twenty people are ready here, I send them to Germany. If in
Japan they need, I send people there. So twenty people go to Germany and
from that commune twenty people come here. So in both ways it is a great
exchange program. My twenty people there will try to create the energy
field, and those twenty people here will learn how energy fields are
created and how one should preserve them.</p><p>Soon I want a belt of energy around the earth. And as far as I am
concerned that energy belt is the only hope for life to exist beyond
this century. Otherwise the politicians have already arranged for global
death.</p><p>Q:* HOW CAN THE ENERGY FIELD, THE GESTALT, OF THIS PLACE CONTINUE
WITH NO CHILDREN BEING BORN? I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR VIEWS ON THAT
SUBJECT AND I AGREE WITH THEM. I JUST WONDER HOW WILL YOU ACCOUNT FOR
THAT? HOW CAN IT CONTINUE AND EVERYONE JUST GETS OLDER AND THERE ARE NO
YOUNG PEOPLE COMING UP?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They will be coming. I am telling my people not to produce
children. Enough young people are all around the world. why bother
creating children and waste your energy in growing them up? I need all
that energy for my energy field. So right now I cannot spend any amount
of energy in giving birth to children and rearing them.</p><p>And what is the use when all over the world there are millions of
young people frustrated with the whole society, searching for a new way
of life? It is so easy. When you can get ready-made young people, it is
simply uneconomical to produce children. And we are going to get hold of
the whole youth because there is no competitor around.</p><p>The young man has fallen away from the old generation and the old
people are trying hard to bridge the gap. Their priests are learning
psychology, doing research work, getting Ph.D.s in psychology, in
psychiatry and philosophy to figure out somehow what has happened, why
this generation gap goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger.</p><p>But they are not going to be able to bridge it for the simple reason
that they are still trying to bridge it so that they can keep the young
people in the old fold. The young people need a milieu of freedom, love,
responsibility, joy. They are not concerned with your God, whether he
exists or not. They are not interested in your heaven and hell.</p><p>The whole old mind is so out of date that just by changing words and
paraphrasing old things into new language, they are not going to manage
to</p><p>fulfill the needs of the young people. In fact they are the cause of
creating this whole frustration, anxiety, anguish in young people all
around the world.</p><p>I am the alternative. I will tell my people to produce children only
when we cannot get any from the ready-made market. And I don't think
that is going to happen. The ready-made market is so big, and people are
continuously bringing new children into the world, not knowing that they
are bringing people for me. They would stop if they knew that Pope the
Polack and Mother Teresa-type people are all working for me by
preventing people from using birth control methods, the pill, by
teaching people that abortion is a sin. They don't know -- unknowingly,
they are my agents. They are working; and, for centuries, you need not
worry, new people will be coming in.</p><p>And when we have enough energy field that the whole earth is
surrounded by a certain belt of energy, then I can tell to my people: it
is time. You produce. Certainly your children will be far better. They
will come out of your meditativeness, out of your love. They will not be
accidental. But not now. The way I have got all these people from
ready-made shops -- I am going to continue my business the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE
COMMUNITY IN OREGON THINKS ABOUT YOU; THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT YOU, YOU
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. BUT I WANTED TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT THE
POLARIZATION THAT HAS GONE ON FOR FOUR YEARS OR SO IN OREGON. I FINALLY
CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POLARIZATION WAS A KIND OF PUBLIC
DYNAMIC MEDITATION THAT YOU WERE CARRYING ON TO TRY AND INCREASE TENSION
FOR A LONG TIME SO THAT AFTER A WHILE IT WOULD RELAX. YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD, "YES."</p><p>A:* I will go on finding new ways to create more and more madness in
the Oregonians because that is one of my ways of working. That's what I
have been doing in India, and I am going to do it in America. Wherever I
am, my way of finding friends is to create enemies. Then a clear-cut
polarization happens. If there are no enemies outside, your friends
become lousy, lazy, dull, dead. A certain hostility around is absolutely
necessary for you to be alert, to be stronger, to be together. This
happens naturally. I can create any kind of opposition. If one dies,
another; there is no trouble in it. And since we are not troubled and we
are always the beneficiaries of it, why should we stop it?</p><p>That's why I refused point blank the question of a journalist who
asked if there were any possibility of coexistence. I said, "Never.
Either we or they." It is a question of either/or. It is not politics in
which nations coexist. Jews and Christians coexist with all their
hostility repressed. They are not friends.</p><p>Now the Pope is trying to make some arrangements with the Jews,
trying to forget all those two thousand years of hostility. But neither
can Christians forget</p><p>that Jesus was crucified, nor can Jews forget what has been done to
them continuously for two thousand years. This is a political way: You
keep your hostility repressed and I keep my hostility repressed, because
somehow we are here; we have to be here, so we coexist.</p><p>I don't like that word at all. I have my own word. I call it parallel
existence: We will exist the way we want to exist; you exist the way you
want to exist. There is no question of coexistence, it is parallel
existence -- two lines running parallel, meeting never.</p><p>The only way is that you convince us that you are more joyful, more
dancing, more blissful. I am not concerned about theories -- that you
convince us about God; I am concerned about people. You have to prove
that you are more joyful than we are, you are more blissful than we are,
you are more peaceful than we are. Then certainly we will mix with you.
What is the need to remain separate?</p><p>Or, sooner or later you have to recognize -- ion fact, even in their
hostility people have recognized it reluctantly -- that these people are
certainly happy, far happier than they have ever been.</p><p>Their theology has not helped. It has helped them to become more
miserable. Their Jesus Christ has not come to save them. Their politics
and their politicians have failed them. Their leaders are just
professional liars.</p><p>They have to see that there is a small oasis amongst them where no
politics exists, no competition exists, no jealousy exists; where the
people are working so hard for twelve and fourteen hours a day, seven
days a week with no holiday. Since I don't believe in God, I don't
believe that on Sunday he stopped working, so I cannot give any holiday.
People are working fourteen hours a day and looking so happy and so
radiant and so joyful and so dancing -- how long can they ignore that
fact?</p><p>It is something existential, not theoretical. It is not like
Protestant Martin Luther arguing with the Catholic Pope. It is not
Hindus arguing against Buddhists. It is a totally different kind of
argument. We are not saying anything -- we are showing them something;
and sooner or later they will have to see it. They will have to hear our
laughter, they will have to see this desert becoming again green,
bringing flowers. For fifty years it has been a dead land. They will see
birds coming again, animals coming.</p><p>I don't think that they are more stupid than the animals. You go in
the night in the commune and you will find deer standing on the road not
caring at all about you. They know my sannyasins -- nobody is going to
hurt them. People have to get out of their cars to push them away.</p><p>In my own garden I have one hundred peacocks. They don't allow even
me in the house. They are blocking my way all over the place; not only
blocking, if they are somewhere else, they rush toward the car just to
stand in front. I enjoy. That means they have understood that nobody is
going to harm them, and they love the play. I will move the car slowly,
they will go on moving backwards slowly, but they will not go out of the
way.</p><p>I don't think Oregonians are more stupid than the peacocks and the
deer and the swans that we have. Nobody is worried here, not even
animals.</p><p>When I came to this place the junipers were small, dying, almost
dead. Now they are lush green, have become thicker, bigger. Just four
years more and you will see all these hills green and all this valley
full of laughter.</p><p>Oregonians cannot resist the temptation to come here, to see the
people, to understand the people. That's why I don't believe in
coexistence. My denial was not understood by the journalist who had
asked, because the moment I said, "Never," she immediately left the
mike. She should have asked what were my implications, what did I mean
by never, why was I saying never.</p><p>Perhaps she had come to hear that word, and once she got it, her
prejudice was fulfilled and she immediately left. If she had asked my
implications, she would have understood -- we coexist only with
enemies.</p><p>I would like to be one with the Oregonians, not coexist -- that word
is ugly, but that woman was so prejudiced she could not stay a single
moment. She did not give me a chance to explain what I meant. That's
what I was going to do, but as I looked, she was gone. So I said it is
better to let her go; that will create more hostility and it will do
something good.</p><p>In my life everything has been doing good to me. I have never come
across any situation which finally has not been a blessing. So I have
learned to trust life and its ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THERE'S SO MUCH MUSIC THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS PLACE, A MUSIC OF
AN ORIGINAL SORT. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL EVER BE A LITERATURE
COMING OUT OF HERE?</p><p>A:* Soon everything will be coming out from here. And everything that
will come out from here will have a different flavor to it. We have
sculptors here, for example, but right now they are making houses,
roads, and other things which are of more basic necessity. Once we are
finished with the infrastructure of the commune, all our sculptors will
be free, all our painters will be free, all our poets will be free, and
you will see something of a totally new quality coming in every
direction, every dimension.</p><p>I have here around me the most intelligent group you can find -- the
most talented people who can do anything -- you just have to give them
time, the opportunity, and they are ready to do anything.</p><p>Do you see my watch? Piaget was asking half a million dollars for it.
One of my sannyasins I sent to Switzerland to learn how to make watches.
Within two weeks he was back and since then he has made four or five
watches and he has been teaching other sannyasins. The other sannyasin
has made this watch. It is far better than the Piaget, far more
accurate, and it is made of real stones -- not of diamonds. It is not
fake: real, authentic stones.</p><p>One of the idiots from Portland said on television that I was wearing
a fake watch. He does not understand language -- these stones are not
fake. These stones are as real as any diamonds. If he cannot make the
distinction between diamonds and stones, that simply means he should
accept his ignorance about jewelry.</p><p>But he cannot make my watch fake! It has been made with so much love,
that to me, these stones are far more precious than any diamonds can be.
I will not sell this watch for ten million dollars; no price will be
accepted for the watch. It cannot be sold: love cannot be sold and
purchased.</p><p>Hearing the man calling the watch fake, I could see how people are
blind. If I was saying that these are diamonds and later on you find
they are not, then certainly it is a fake watch. But I am saying these
are stones. And if you cannot understand any difference between stones
and diamonds, it shows your state of knowledge or ignorance. To me it
makes no difference. These stones are so beautiful, I don't see any
reason why diamonds should be costlier than these stones. These stones
have cost nothing, and my sannyasin's work was a meditation for him.</p><p>We have all kinds of people here. We have made all the houses
ourselves. We have made the big Gurdjieff Dam, and soon we are going to
double it because there is still space and we can go deeper into the
mountains. We have made all our roads ... and sometime I can take you to
my own road which my people have made especially for me. Perhaps I am
the only man in the whole world who has a road for himself. No traffic,
no need to follow any rules of the road. I can go the British way or the
American way or the Russian way, it makes no problem. The whole road is
available.</p><p>And my people who made the road had never made roads, but they
learned it immediately. You need just a little intelligence to learn
anything. My people are doing all computer work. They have become so
expert that now they are selling their expertise in the outside world.
My people had never made any houses. Now they have become so expert that
they are making houses for others in Germany, in Switzerland, in
England. Cheaper, better, more comfortable, more contemporary.</p><p>Novels will be coming. Dramas will be coming everything that man can
do, we are going to do, and better. We just have to settle down.</p><p>And we are settling down even against the Oregon government, the
Oregonians. Nothing makes any difference -- we are settling down, we are
settled -- nobody can throw us out from here.</p><p>Q:* WOULD YOU PERSONALLY LIKE TO EVER TRAVEL AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, because there is nothing outside. Here, yes -- I have been to
the disco yesterday. I enjoyed it!</p><p>Q:* DID YOU DANCE?</p><p>A:* Yes.</p><p>Q:* I READ IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES FROM ONE OF YOUR INTERVIEWS THIS
PAST WEEK THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO MAKE LOVE TO
A WOMAN ANY MORE -- YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY FOR THOSE GYMNASTICS --
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE DISCO.…</p><p>A:* I have energy for women also. I just wanted my men sannyasins not
to be worried! Because if I am interested in any women, then her
boyfriend is finished. It is just to solace them. I have enough energy,
there is no problem. So all my male sannyasins have been immensely
happy. The women sannyasins look a little sad, but I find other ways to
make them happy. There is no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GLASSES?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That was just because of these lights, my eyes were feeling
teary. Continuous exposure for two hours in the morning or two and a
half hours, two and a half hours in the evening, my eyes started feeling
teary. That's why I used those glasses; I don't need them now that they
have managed to put the lights a little farther away. I think they need
still to adjust because I can feel the strain on the eyes a little.
Otherwise, my eyes ... you just look at my eyes.</p><p>People think they get hypnotized ... I don't know. Journalists avoid
looking into the eyes that perhaps they may get hypnotized. And for me
it is such a simple job that I don't need to exert too much energy --
just a little smile toward a woman is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't have to chase her and go through all the dramas and traumas.
There is no need. In my whole life I have never met a single woman who
was not ready the moment I looked into her eyes. Where she was going to
find such a simple man who has not even asked her name, who has not
asked her address? And on the next railway station, I get down and we
shall never meet again. The introduction has not happened, but I have
made love to the woman.</p><p>I am not British. They will not do anything without introduction.</p><p>But to me everything is love. Talking to my people is making love to
them. My words reaching into their hearts create orgasmic reactions in
their being. Just coming and going, dancing with my people ... just for
a second stopping to dance with someone, and that's enough. That woman
is not going to sleep the whole night -- you can ask the woman -- she is
going to dream continuously of the dance.</p><p>I have already made love. To me love is nothing in particular to do
with sex. there are a thousand and one ways of making love. Sex is the
lowest, the animal heritage. And I would like my people to rise above
biology. Only then will they be really free. Then you can find thousands
of ways of making love. Just sitting silently together doing nothing,
but full of love for each other, and there is a certain meeting which is
happening between the two energies. So I am continuously making love to
my people in every kind of possible way.</p><p>Don't be worried about my energy. And don't be worried about my eyes.
They are perfectly okay and I am a non-serious man, so I have the
freedom to say anything that comes to my mind without ever bothering
about the consequences. And my whole life's experience is such that
nothing has ever gone wrong. So I have become absolutely certain that
nothing ever goes wrong, you just have to trust existence. And whatever
happens is right.</p><p>You meet my people and you ask them ... everybody will say I have
made love to them. Talking is a way of making love. Dancing is a way of
making love. But these are higher qualities of love. Animals cannot
understand it; you can go on playing the flute and the buffalo will go
on chewing the grass. She will not even stop to look at what you are
doing. The flute makes no sense to her. But to the lover, you play the
flute and something immediately starts transmitting from your song and
showering on your beloved.</p><p>And my people are searching all possibilities, finding all
possibilities of being in love. Sex is only one of them, and the very
lowest of the kind. In fact, everybody should have a film of himself
making love and see it once in awhile. Then he will see what kind of
gymnastics and what happens to the woman's face -- distortions, and you
call it orgasm? She is having a fit. And the man is trying so hard,
huffing, puffing.</p><p>Everybody should have a film of his own lovemaking just to see it
whenever the desire arises. Just see the film and that will be enough.
That is the very lowest type of thing that is available to all animals.
Man can manage to have many other dimensions, many other levels. And the
higher you reach towards enlightenment, new dimensions open up.</p><p>For a man who has passed through the door to the other side,
everything is love. My whole twenty-four hours, I am making love to
existence in different ways. If I am taking a shower, I enjoy it as much
as making love to a woman. So what is the difference? I am contacting
existence through water. It is not necessary that I should make the
contact with existence through a feminine body.</p><p>Eating, I am making love, because I eat with such joy. And I don't
see any difference. My joy is the same. So twenty-four hours I am in
love. It does not matter what I am doing. That you can take as a
criterion of the man who has gone beyond enlightenment: whatever he does
is love. Whatever he says is love. If he does nothing, that is love. If
he remains silent, that is love.</p><p>Now, should we start dancing?</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-21>The Last Testament, Vol 1

TRANSPIRED PREVIOUSLY?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Two things: One is that nuclear weapons are coming to a point
where either we have to stop producing them totally, or we have to be
ready to evaporate from this planet. The second thing that has been of
tremendous significance is the discovery of the disease AIDS.</p><p>Now it seems humanity is between two ditches. Almost walking on a
razor's edge. Either nuclear weapons will destroy it, or the disease
AIDS will destroy it. The destruction is becoming more, more probable
than it was before.</p><p>It is easy to control the politicians, convince the politicians not
to go forward, but how to convince the virus that creates AIDS, and how
to convince the people to turn away from all the perversions that
religions have forced upon their sexuality? AIDS is the culmination of
homosexuality, lesbianism and all kinds of perversions.</p><p>But the source is religious insistence on celibacy, which is
unnatural. If you force people to be celibate, and you force men and
women to live separately in monasteries and nunneries, homosexuality is
bound to happen. You cannot prevent it, because man's sexuality will
have to have to find some way out.</p><p>And AIDS is the ultimate of that perversion. They don't know that
there is any possibility to find a cure for it. Almost all the experts
are agreed that a person who has confirmed AIDS is going to die within
two years.</p><p>But within two years he can spread the disease to thousands of
people. By sexual contact, just by kissing somebody, and a few experts
are even suspecting that it may be contracted by breathing. Then we are
on wildfire, which can spread all over the earth without any
limitation.</p><p>It seems everything is against humanity. It is as if this planet is
going to die. That's why I started speaking again. I felt that seeing
the death of the planet just as an observer is irresponsibility. I have
to respond to the situation, and I am spreading -- through my
sannyasins, through mass media, in every possible way</p><p>-- how we can destroy the idea of celibacy from religions, how we can
convert homosexuals into heterosexuals, how we can convince the women's
liberation movement that lesbianism is not liberation but sheer
stupidity, and how we can create an atmosphere around the world that
will force politicians to stop piling up more and more nuclear
weapons.</p><p>It is almost an impossible task, but not absolutely impossible, and
when the life of the whole planet is at risk, everything should be done
to prevent it. Every intelligent man's door should be knocked on. It is
time to take the challenge and come out.</p><p>The artists, the painters, the scientists, the dancers, the
musicians, all the creative people around the world should declare that
any government that goes on piling up nuclear weapons is anti-people,
anti-humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU SPEAK OF CHANGING HUMAN NATURE. NOW THAT THE VIRUS AIDS IS
HERE, IT IS PRESENT, IT IS THERE. NOW THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE IN
EXISTENCE. IS CHANGING HUMAN NATURE AKIN TO CLOSING THE BARN DOOR AFTER
THE ANIMAL HAS ESCAPED, NOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY HERE?</p><p>A:* Changing human nature can make a lot of difference, because AIDS
is not a natural disease.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because all the medical experts are agreed that it is a
by-product of homosexuality. No heterosexual couple who has remained
together without sexual contacts with other people has come up with
AIDS. Homosexuality -- if we can simply convince the popes and the imams
and Ayatollah Khomeini and all these idiots to stop this idea of
celibacy -- allow your monks, your nuns to make love, and allow humanity
freedom from the guilt of making love, don't make it a sin. At this
moment every resource should be used to convert</p><p>perversions back to nature. Heterosexuality is a natural phenomenon.
And out of heterosexuality there is no possibility of AIDS.</p><p>Secondly, the very fact that we have so many nuclear weapons that we
can destroy the whole humanity 700 times is enough, if everybody comes
to know about what the politicians are doing. Even the politicians are
no more so enthusiastic about a nuclear war. They can also see that in
this war nobody is going to be defeated and nobody is going to be
victorious. This war is a global suicide, it is not war. Just a huge
amount of nuclear weapons is enough to prevent it being used.</p><p>So I am not without hope. I see every possibility that we can change
the course where we are going unconsciously. There is no need for AIDS
to be there, and there is no need for a nuclear war to be there. In
fact, we can change the nuclear energy into creative sources. We can
make this earth a beautiful garden without hunger, without poverty,
without disease. It will be simply idiotic to use so much energy for
destroying innocent people, and for destroying the only planet around
here that is alive.</p><p>Q:* ARE YOU GETTING USED TO THE TAPE CHANGES, THE INTERRUPTIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am accustomed to every kind of change.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, WE HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS DURING YOUR THREE YEARS OF
SILENCE ABOUT YOU OWN HEALTH. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am feeling better.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE BACK PROBLEMS, THE ALLERGIES, THEY ARE IMPROVING?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, they are there, but these are not sicknesses which can ever
be cured. You have to take care and avoid the situations in which they
can occur. I am as allergic as I have ever been, but all the
possibilities of allergy are prevented. I don't come in contact with any
perfume. I don't come in contact with crowds, perspiration, smells,
dust. Then I am perfectly okay, there is no problem. Those allergies are
not diseases -- they are simply my heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE THEY FRUSTRATIONS, LIMITING YOUR...?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, no frustration in it. In fact, it keeps me absolutely clean.
And it keeps me isolated, which I enjoy. Because to be silent and alone
gives the greatest bliss that is possible in life.</p><p>So I don't take allergies as a disadvantage -- it has proved a
blessing in disguise. My back also has been a blessing in disguise. It
is the same -- the problem is there. The best experts in India and from
England confirmed that it is not something that will leave me. I will
have to live with it.</p><p>And, you will be surprised, because of my back, only Rolls Royce
suits me. No other car, no other chair. So you can see the blessing in
disguise: my back has brought Rolls Royces to me.</p><p>Q:* SO THAT'S THE REASON! I'VE BEEN WONDERING!</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, that's the reason. Everybody has been wondering, but that is
the reason. I keep people wondering about many things.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW CAN A MAN WHO LIKES ROLLS ROYCES DISLIKE SPAGHETTI?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That is a long story! I used to have a very beautiful woman
around me -- an Italian woman -- twenty years ago. I don't think she
ever took a bath. She was simple against it, it seems. She smelled...
just disgusting! But she was a beautiful woman.…</p><p>At that time I was not aware that I am allergic. The day I became
aware that I am allergic, I got rid of that woman. She was the first
woman who brought spaghetti to me, and it smelled of her. That's why I
am against spaghetti -- even the name of spaghetti reminds me of that
woman, and I immediately start feeling that my attack of athsma is
coming. Otherwise, I have nothing against spaghetti.</p><p>Q:* LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT MAY BE LESS PLEASANT THAN
SPAGHETTI, OR MORE UNPLEASANT.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, nothing is more unpleasant.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR FOLLOWERS WHEN YOU PASS ON?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Who cares? What was happening to them when I was not here? The
world goes on. When I was not here -- it is not a problem to me -- what
was happening in the world was happening.</p><p>I was not here, I was not responsible for it. When I am gone, to you
I am gone; to me you are gone. So the curtain falls.</p><p>Q:* WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU NOW TO BE HERE, TO REMAIN IN THE
UNITED STATES, TO REMAIN IN OREGON, TO HAVE THE ATTORNEYS FIGHTING THE
BATTLES WITH IMMIGRATION?</p><p>A:* I enjoy fighting. And because I have found the most backward
people here in Oregon, I have chosen it. The fight is going to be long.
The longer it goes, the longer it will keep me alive. The longer it
goes, the stronger it will make my people. And we are on the right
path.</p><p>We are fighting for those values America stands for, and they are
fighting against America. We are fighting for the Constitution of
America, and they are doing everything against the Constitution. So it
has to be seen who wins. We may be a small minority, but I promise you
that we are going to win in every case against the state of Oregon.</p><p>And we are going to prove to these people that it is not so easy to
go against the only constitution in the world which has some democratic
fragrance about it.</p><p>Q:* DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON, OR
DO THEY HAVE TO BE DEFEATED?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't want to persuade anybody. Either they defeat me, or I
defeat them. No compromise.</p><p>Truth knows no compromise. The lies always are ready to compromise.
Naturally, because in compromise, truth will always be the loser and the
lie will always be the gainer. The lie is zero, it has nothing to
lose.</p><p>Yes, the state government has been trying to compromise. The federal
government has been sending their mediators to compromise. I am not
going to compromise, and when the other party is trying to compromise,
that shows where they are. They know that if they don't compromise, they
are going to lose the whole thing. And why should I compromise when I
know that the whole thing is going to be mine?</p><p>Q:* WHEN YOU USE PHRASES THAT ARE TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE OF OREGON AND
OTHERS AS INFLAMMATORY IN YOUR DISCOURSES.… YOU HAVE REFERRED TO PEOPLE
WHO ARE HELD VERY DEARLY BY PEOPLE HERE ... BY PHRASES SUCH AS "POPE THE
POLACK," "CHRIST THE CRACKPOT," "MOTHER TERESA, THE CRIMINAL." ARE THOSE
PHRASES INTENDED TO BRING ENLIGHTENMENT TO PEOPLE, OR DO THEY INSTEAD
FILL THE HEARTS OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH SUCH HATRED THAT THEY CANNOT HEAR
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It works in many ways. Those are my devices. First, I am talking
to my own people. They are not hurt by what I am saying about Pope the
Polack, Teresa the Terrible, Christ the Crackpot -- nobody is hurt. On
the contrary, they start looking at things in a totally new way, the way
I want them to look at them.</p><p>I want outside people to get hurt, shocked. I want them to be angry,
hateful, because it is a very fundamental principle of psychology that
if you can create hate in a man, it is very easy to change it into love.
Love and hate are not so</p><p>different as people think, and certainly they are not opposites. They
are two polarities of one energy, just like darkness and light.</p><p>So without going anywhere, just sitting in my room, I can manage to
give shocks all around the world, shake people in their sleep, in their
slumber. Because to me their Christianity is a kind of opium, and their
Hinduism is a kind of marijuana, and so on, so forth. These people need
to be shaken really badly.</p><p>And I will go on throwing ice-cold water on their eyes as long as
they don't open their eyes and jump out of the bed. It is not a question
of persuasion. You don't persuade a sleeping person to wake up, because
between a person who is awake and a person who is asleep there is no
possibility of communication. So whether they hear me or not, I want
them to be hateful against me, that's enough -- I have done my job. All
these people.…</p><p>And there are almost one million sannyasins around the world. Even in
Soviet Russia, even in East Germany I have my sannyasins. Of course,
they are underground sannyasins. From where are these people coming?
First they were shocked, first they were hurt, but their shock and their
hurt started a great question, a great quest in their minds.</p><p>They became suspicious about their own conditioning: Perhaps Christ
was a crackpot? Let us give it another thought. And Pope is certainly
the Polack, there are not two opinions about it, and you cannot find a
thicker head than Pope the Polack's, because the world is suffering from
overpopulation, and he is preaching around the world against birth
control, against the pill, against abortion.</p><p>This man -- if I call him a criminal, I am not condemning him, only
describing him -- perhaps he is the greatest criminal alive. And the
same is my attitude about the Hindu leader, shankaracharya, Mohammedan
leaders like Ayatollah Khomeini -- I call him Khomeiniac -- because
these are the people who are insisting on more and more population on
the earth.</p><p>Ethiopia is dying, India is dying, soon the third world will be dying
of starvation. And who will be responsible for it? Mother Teresa will be
responsible for it, Pope will be responsible for it. In the eyes of the
future, these people will be as criminal as middle ages popes are
criminal in our eyes. They burned innocent old women, just calling them
witches. So what? If somebody wants to be a witch</p><p>-- the word is not bad, it just means a wise woman -- so whose
business is it to prevent?</p><p>In the middle ages, the same popes representing the same Jesus
Christ, calling themselves infallible, burned thousands of women alive
because they decided that they are in conspiracy with the devil. Now no
intelligent person today can stand on their side in that matter. They
themselves feel ashamed. In fact, they burned Joan of Arc as a witch,
but it was so much against people's love for that courageous young woman
that finally after three hundred years, they changed their verdict.</p><p>One infallible pope burns the woman alive, declares her a witch;
another infallible pope declares Joan of Arc a saint. From the grave the
bones are pulled out and worshipped.</p><p>Now these idiots -- you want me to be polite with them? And they are
dragging the whole world towards poverty. They have a vested interest in
poverty -- they have to be exposed. Mother Teresa wants more and more
orphans in the world; otherwise who is going to give her Nobel prizes
and all kinds of awards and titles? She is roaming around the world -- I
don't know when she finds time for serving humanity -- receiving
rewards, awards, titles, opening functions, conferences. I can't think
when she serves humanity. All she is doing is collecting Hindu and
Mohammedan orphans and converting them into Catholics. This is sheer
politics of number, she is a cunning politician. It is not even right to
call her a woman -- she has no heart. She is simply a puppet in the
hands of the Vatican.</p><p>Q:* IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT A CHILD DYING OF STARVATION AND
NOT TO FEEL A TUG AT YOUR HEART, A DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE
CHILD?</p><p>A:* I will do something for the child: I will give him an injection
and send him into eternal sleep. That is my compassion. To keep him
alive for his whole life to starve again and again, fall sick, create
more children who will be sick, who will be again orphans -- this is
sheer stupidity.</p><p>I am a simple man of mathematics. If Ethiopia is dying, my compassion
says there is no point in sending food, because these Ethiopians with
that food will crate more Ethiopians. This is not a solution.</p><p>Either give them so much that they can live at your standard of
living -- but for that you will have to stop all your nuclear weapons
and all your war efforts and all the money that you go on pouring into
them. Or, if you cannot do that -- and nobody is willing to do that --
these hypocrites go on calling themselves compassionate. What kind of
compassion is this?</p><p><br></p><p>[text missing here in change from tape one, side A to side B]</p><p><br></p><p>... a little butter to the Ethiopians. For four years they have been
dying, because for four years there has been no rain. And now every day
thousands of people are dying. All over the world politicians feel
compassionate. They send a little bit, but their gifts prove to be only
spoonfuls of sugar thrown into the ocean to make it sweet.</p><p>No, I am not so gullible. I can see the point is either, if you want
to destroy poverty from the earth, stop war, stop all this nonsense of
America and Soviet Union; or, be at least honest and say we cannot save
Ethiopia, we cannot save India.</p><p>Why allow those people to starve and suffer? We can easily send
medical teams -</p><p>- I can send my own medical team. And this is such a simple affair,
just one injection and the person goes into eternal sleep. And there is
no problem, because if the soul is eternal, as all the religions say,
then you have not done anything. Just the house was falling and you have
moved the soul into a new house, a better house, a fresher house.</p><p>But if all these religions are wrong and communists and materialists
are right, then too, there is no problem. They say when the body dies,
everything dies, there is no soul left -- no problem is there. So
whether one believes in the soul or does not believe in the soul, it is
better to let these poor people at least die peacefully. You could not
help them to live peacefully, joyously, but you can at least send them
to death peacefully, silently. That is my compassion.</p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OTHER MISFORTUNATE SOULS.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* You can ask about anything, because I have no secrets to keep
about anything, I have nothing private, I am absolutely open to all
kinds of queries. And I am going to say exactly what everybody wants to
say, but they don't have the guts to say it. And I don't care about any
respectability -- I am already notorious enough. And I enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU ENJOY IT? HOW SO?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, I enjoy it. To be respectable means bourgeois; to be
notorious means rebellious. Every revolutionary will be notorious in his
time, and every respectable person is nothing but in the service of the
vested interests. Certainly, you don't give Nobel prizes to notorious
people like me. You give Nobel prizes to Mother Teresa. She is respected
because she is serving your vested interests.</p><p>I am notorious, but I enjoy it. I don't want to be respectable. To be
respected this mad humanity is insulting.</p><p>Q:* LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PERHAPS MADE YOU
NOTORIOUS IN THIS HUMANITY -- BRINGING THE UNFORTUNATE SOULS I WAS ABOUT
TO TALK ABOUT EARLIER, THE HOBOS, THE TRANSIENTS, THE DERELICTS WHO WERE
BROUGHT HERE LAST FALL. DID YOU APPROVE OF THAT? WAS THAT A WISE THING
TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* We enjoyed doing it, and it was the best thing to do. And we are
going to do something better soon, so you will forget about it
completely. And each year we are going to do something better. That's
the only way.</p><p>When you have a headache and you feel it is unbearable, I will just
set fire to your house, and soon you will forget all about your
headache.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHY DID THOSE MEN NOT FORGET ABOUT THEIR HEADACHES? WHY COULDN'T
THEY ADAPT HERE? WHY DID THEY LEAVE?</p><p>A:* Because they were uneducated, because they had been provided for
their whole life food, clothes and other things by the churches and
Christian associations, to live a life of misery on the streets. Those
people were retarded.</p><p>Q:* BUT YOU KNEW THAT. WHY DID YOU STILL BRING THEM HERE?</p><p>A:* I tried it as an experiment. Those who could understand me are
still here. Those who could not, they have left -- they were free. In an
experiment, you have to take the risk.</p><p>I am going to take a greater risk soon. Q:* COULD YOU AMPLIFY ON
THAT?</p><p>A:* No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHEN WILL YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Not right now. It is going to be declared in a world press
conference. It is not a simple, small thing. It is really big.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT THE INTENT IS TO BRING THE WORD TO ADDITIONAL PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. Just to bring more notoriety to me!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS COMMUNE HAS DEVELOPED? LET ME ASK
IN PARTICULAR ABOUT ALL THE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS THAT APPARENTLY HAVE
BECOME NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMUNE. IS THAT THE
KIND OF ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH YOU LIVE TO LIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. Your question is wrong. I am absolutely happy with the
commune and its development.</p><p>But behind the question, you are being journalistic. You are saying,
"To save the integrity of the community there are guns and guards." That
is absolutely wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THEM, THEN?</p><p>A:* The reason for those guards is because I have been attacked many
times in my life: I have been poisoned; an attempt was made to kill me
with a knife before then thousand sannyasins -- and twenty police
officers, because they got the message that something was going to
happen that morning, so they reached in time before the knife was thrown
at me. The man was caught red-handed. Ten thousand witness, twenty
police officers as witnesses -- and still the man was freed by the court
with punishment.</p><p>Now, if my people feel to protect me, I am not going to interfere,
for the simple reason that I don't interfere. If somebody is going to
assassinate me, I will say hi to him, too. I will not interfere.</p><p>And if my people who love me want to protect me -- and what
protection? In a nuclear world, do you think those guns mean anything?
Except for their love for me, those guns are toy guns. What can they
do?</p><p>But I respect their love. I don't care about their guns. And those
guns are not for the integrity of the community. The community is
integrated on its own. Those guns have nothing to do with it. And those
guns have not been used for four years to harm anybody. And they will
never be used to harm anybody.</p><p>But if somebody tries to harm the community, certainly, we will do
everything to fight back. I believe in tit for tat.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE COMMUNE HERE DEFENDING ITSELF IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME ATTACK
-- IS THAT IN CONCEPT ANY DIFFERENT FROM A NATION STOCKPILING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM AN ATTACK?</p><p>A:* No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I GATHER FROM YOUR CONDEMNATION, THEN, OF STOCKPILING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS THAT YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH WHAT THE COMMUNE IS DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. I am not stockpiling nuclear weapons here, and I won't allow
my commune to stockpile nuclear weapons. And I don't want nations not to
have armies, not to have other weapons. I am just against nuclear
weapons. Other weapons are just a football match, and man is an animal
-- once in a while there is an itch to fight.</p><p>I am in favor of pre-first-world-war weapons. Do your best -- those
weapons were perfectly good. And the world was a far more pleasant place
to live before the first world war, because the population was small,
and your wars helped to keep the balance of population. You need
wars.</p><p>I am not a pacifist. I think if wars completely disappear, it will be
a loss. It is perfectly good for this mad humanity once in a while to
erupt into a war, destroy a few people, because they were surplus, and
keep the balance.</p><p>I am against nuclear weapons because that will destroy the whole
humanity and then there will be no fourth world war. And that I don't
like! I would love fourth world war, fifth world, war, and history goes
on. But this third world war is dangerous -- it simply puts a full point
on history. That's why I am against it.</p><p>Otherwise, I am not against war. It is just children playing. Let
them play -- there is no harm. So if my commune wants to collect
pre-first-world-war weapons, I am for it!</p><p>Q:* I DON'T THINK THEY HAD OUZIS IN WORLD WAR I, DID THEY?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They are not nuclear weapons. They are freely available in the
market, anybody can purchase them. The government does not think them
serious weapons. Anybody who wants to purchase them in any numbers can
purchase them. They are freely available.</p><p>And if Oregonians have them, I will not prevent my people. If
Oregonians have one, my people will have two, because in a game you
should not lag behind. And what does it matter? People have to die
anyway.</p><p>And the strangest thing is that most of people -- ninety-nine percent
of people -- die on their beds. That is the most dangerous place!
Ninety-nine percent. Only one percent manage to die in varieties of
ways.</p><p>So this is nothing wrong. Just if people want to fight, have a good
fight -- enjoy it, celebrate it! Oregonians will be fighting with
hostility and we will be fighting with songs and dances and
celebration.</p><p>Perhaps they will be able to kill us, but they cannot kill our spirit
-- the spirit of ecstasy. And that will haunt them more. The ghost of
Rajneeshpuram may haunt the whole of America!</p><p>Q:* THAT'S AN OMINOUS STATEMENT. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A VISION? IS
THIS COMMUNE GOING TO BECOME SOME FORM OF MARTYR?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, no. I am just joking!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW MUCH OF THE TIME ARE YOU JOKING?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* All the time!... One hundred percent! I am absolutely a
non-serious person, so I can say anything because a non-serious person
has no bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY?</p><p>A:* They are foolish! They should learn to take me non-seriously, the
way I take the whole world non-seriously. If they don't learn it, then
they unnecessarily get terrified, go through nervous breakdowns. I am
absolutely non-serious. What I</p><p>am saying to you, I may contradict tomorrow -- or if you want, right
now! I can do that, too.</p><p>Just don't change the cassette in the middle!</p><p>Q:* YOU AT TIMES HAVE SPOKEN WELL OF SOME OF THE THINGS JESUS SAID,
SOME OF THE WORDS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO BUDDHA, TO MOHAMMED. AND I HAVE
ALSO UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THAT MUCH OF WHAT THEY DID THAT IS GOOD WAS
LOST IN THE FORMALISM OF THEIR FOLLOWERS, WHAT THE FOLLOWERS TRIED TO
ESTABLISH. I WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU SEE A PARALLEL HAPPENING IN THIS
COMMUNE HERE -- THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS BEING LOST IN THE FORMALISM
OF YOUR FOLLOWERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. It is impossible. First I have to remind you that whatever I
have said about Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed -- and that there is much good
in them which has been lost by their followers -- is centuries old. You
are quoting Old Testament, and I am now in the middle of the LAST
TESTAMENT.</p><p>Those statements belonged three and a half years ago, before I went
into silence. And do you know why I went into silence for three and a
half years? Because I got tired of telling beautiful things about Jesus,
knowing perfectly well that he was a crackpot.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT, THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because I wanted to catch hold of Christians, and I got them! I
have my devices -- I may be a madman but I have my methodology.</p><p>Q:* DO THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes.</p><p>Q:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN MACHIAVELLI? IS THAT PART OF YOUR
PHILOSOPHY?</p><p>A:* Machiavelli can be my disciple, and he will enjoy learning a few
more things that he has missed. I spoke on Jesus and I said he had said
many beautiful things. And I interpreted him, but that interpretation
was mine. It has nothing to do with Jesus. I was simply trying to catch
hold of a few Christians, but that I was doing with all the
religions.</p><p>It is natural, because all the people of the world are already
divided. When I came into this world, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody
is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu -- no customer available! And I have
to do my business, too. I have every right. So, how to get
customers?</p><p>I had to plan devices. And the natural way was -- the simpler way --
that anything that is wrong in Jesus, throw it on his disciples. And
anything that can be seen as good, can be polished, given a more
contemporary ring, bring it above and give the credit to Jesus.</p><p>Great Christians like Stanley Jones, who was a world-famous
missionary, he told me, "I am puzzled. No Christian down the centuries
has even been able to give such beautiful meaning to the words of
Jesus." I said, "The trouble is, I cannot tell you the truth." That poor
fellow is dead now -- but to you I can tell the truth: What beauty can
be in Jesus' words? He was uneducated, uncultured, a carpenter's son. In
his time it was said laughingly, "Look at the Messiah. Who</p><p>has ever heard that prophets and messiahs are born in Bethlehem?"
Bethlehem became a laughing stock because of Jesus, and he was looked at
like a buffoon. Riding on his donkey, proclaiming himself as the only
begotten son of God.… Just see it, visualize it: a man sitting on a
donkey looking like a perfect hippie, declaring he is the only begotten
son of God, and telling you, "Unless you follow me, there is no way to
be saved. At the last judgment day, I will choose my sheep and they will
enter into paradise. And those who are not chosen by me, will fall into
eternal hell."</p><p>And have you ever thought of the meaning of eternal hell? In a
seventy-year life, how man sins can you commit to deserve eternal hell?
Is there any fairness, justice in existence, or not? In seventy years --
because Christians believe in only one life -- how many sins can you
manage to commit to deserve eternal punishment? This is simply stupid.
Because of this simple statement, Bertrand Russell went against Jesus
and he wrote a book, WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN, because this is simply
unfair, unjust, inhuman. And the man certainly is a mental case.</p><p>Now I have got my people -- from all sources I have caught them, from
Buddhists, from Hindus, from Christians, from Jews. From every land,
from every country, from every race, I have caught hold of those who can
now listen to me directly, and I don't need any Jesus, any Buddha, any
Mohammed to stand between me and my disciples. So I am kicking them
out.</p><p>For three years I remained silent, just to give a gap so people
forget all about what I said before those three years, and I can start
from the very beginning again. So don't quote anything from my books.
Those days are dead -- those books are dead.</p><p>Q:* DO YOU WEAR THAT WATCH EXCEPT DURING TV INTERVIEWS?</p><p>A:* I have got hundreds of watches. And this is the least costly --
just $180,000. I have watches which are a half-million dollars, or more.
And I have hundreds -- but they don't belong to me, they belong to my
sannyasins. This watch, too, is borrowed. Nothing belongs to me;
everything is provided for me. I am just a guest here in this commune. I
am not even a sannyasin.</p><p>Q:* IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY, THAT YOU SAW SPEAKING HIGHLY OF
JESUS AS A STRATEGY TO APPEAL TO CHRISTIANS, TO GET YOUR WORD TO THEM,
AS A TACTIC. DO YOU HAVE NEW TACTICS NOW? IS YOUR TALKING TO US THIS
EVENING -- IS THIS PART OF A NEW TACTIC TO REACH PEOPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Everything I do is a certain device. Talking to you, too. I am
involved in some great alchemical work of transforming people from their
sleep into enlightened souls, and I have to try every kind of device
possible.</p><p>This, too, is part of it. Everything that I say or do is part --
organic part -- of my whole work. And my work is to bring to people
awakening on as big a scale as possible, as it has never happened
before.</p><p>Q:* YOU USED THE FIGURE EARLIER, IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY, OF A
MILLION SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD. WOULD THAT BE YOUR ESTIMATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes.</p><p>Q:* I HAVE READ -- I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY ASCERTAINED THE ACCURACY OF
THIS -- THAT A NUMBER OF YOUR MEDITATION CENTERS BOTH IN THE UNITED
STATES AND IN EUROPE HAVE CLOSED, AND THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME PEOPLE
HAVE DRAWN FROM THAT IS THAT THE NUMBER OF SANNYASINS IS SHRINKING.</p><p>A:* Their conclusion is wrong. We have closed a few centers because
those centers were too small, and the sannyasins were finding it
difficult to live amongst the hostility around them. So we have
consolidated a few centers into a big commune. So those centers have
disappeared, but a new commune has come into existence.</p><p>The number has not decreased, the number has increased because many
who were afraid before to become sannyasins are no more afraid because
they have five hundred sannyasins with them. Now their enemies are
afraid.</p><p>I am consolidating all over the world, and the number is increasing
every day. From a half-million it has reached to one million, and these
are above-ground sannyasins. The underground sannyasins are not included
in it.</p><p>In communist countries, in China, in Russia, in other small communist
countries I have my sannyasins, and they are spreading fast there, too.
In fact, they are more excited than sannyasins anywhere else. Naturally,
human psychology is such that in Moscow they have to meet in a basement
of a friend's house -- silently, afraid even the walls in Russia are
detectives and belong to the KGB.</p><p>There is great excitement in meditation, in reading my books,
listening to my tapes. For sixty years in Russia, religion had almost
disappeared except in a few places which the Russian government has been
keeping up for tourist purposes. Only a few churches are there which are
maintained for foreigners to visit and see that religion has not been
disturbed. Everybody is free -- and you can see.</p><p>But in fact all the churches have become either hospitals or schools,
and the whole country has become atheistic. After sixty years, these
people were born after the revolution. They have been brought up in an
atheist atmosphere. They have been conditioned that there is nothing in
you -- you are only a component of physics, chemistry, biology, but
there is no spirit in you.</p><p>And for the first time they are becoming aware through me that they
are consciousness. All these things are just their house, and they are
not just a composite whole of all these things; they have an
individuality, a consciousness. And the only way to discover it is
meditation, and people are meditating.</p><p>And the government is already starting to persecute them, trying to
find out where they meet, what they do, where they go. They have started
taking my books from them. My books are banned. These are good signs --
this means the youth will get more excited. It has become a revolution,
and that's what the young blood always needs -- some rebellion.</p><p>I have one million people, and they will be growing every day for the
simple reason that there is no other alternative. The old world is
already dead -- or almost dead, which is worse!</p><p>And for the new world there is no other movement except this
movement. It is not a political movement. It does not belong to any
nation. It does not belong to any race. It does not belong to the past.
It is absolutely fresh -- just born, young.</p><p>And you are asking: Can your followers do the same as happened with
Jesus? In the first place, the followers have not destroyed Jesus, Jesus
had everything ready. He had sown the seeds, the followers have only
been reaping the crop. Jesus is responsible.</p><p>I am not giving any theology to my disciples. I am not giving them
any catechism. I am not giving them any belief system. And my statements
are so contradictory, that there is no possibility for anybody to figure
out what kind of man this was. Nobody can bring any deformation, because
I am not giving anything to the disciples -- no discipline, no dogma, no
creed. What can they do? I am giving them freedom to do whatsoever they
want to do. I am giving their responsibility to themselves. I am not
taking their responsibility on me. I am not their savior or prophet or
messiah, no.</p><p>Q:* YOU ARE THEIR MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am master of myself!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE YOU THEIR MASTER, AS WELL?</p><p>A:* No. I am trying to help them to be masters of themselves. I am
just a catalytic agent. I am master of myself, so I know how one becomes
a master of oneself. I am simply sharing my experience with these
people. They are not my followers, they are my fellow travelers. And
they are absolutely free to do anything they want. No restrictions, no
inhibitions, no repressions.</p><p>What can they do? The moment I am gone, they will also go on their
way separately, because their connection with me is direct. They are not
interconnected like Christians or Hindus or Mohammedans. They are
connected to me directly. Each sannyasin has a direct communication line
with me. The moment I am gone, his last barrier is also finished. Other
barriers I had finished before -- now the last barrier, the love towards
me, is also finished.</p><p>He is now totally free. Utterly free -- to be himself. So there is no
problem. The followers of Buddha or Confucius they all destroyed their
Master's things because the Master himself has given all the poison that
was needed to destroy it. For example, Buddhas has given 33,000 rules of
conduct. Even to remember them is impossible, the question of following
them does not arise. And any man trying to follow 33,000 rules of
conduct will soon be in an insane asylum. He will be in the same
position as happened in Aesop's fable of the centipede.</p><p>A centipede is just going for his morning walk. One hundred legs -- a
small rabbit could not believe his eyes, how he managed to walk. One
hundred legs? Which one first, which one second, which one third? He
stopped the centipede and said, "Uncle, I have a question if you don't
mind. How do you manage to walk with one hundred legs? He said, "My God,
I never thought about it! Now I will watch how I walk and then I will
tell you. Up to now I have been simply walking without thinking."</p><p>And he could not walk even a single step. He fell down, because he
was trying to figure out which leg first and which leg second -- and the
number was one hundred. Even a great mathematician like Albert Einstein
would have fallen with one hundred legs. That poor centipede -- knowing
no arithmetic.</p><p>But the centipede was very angry and told the rabbit, "It's okay that
you asked the question to me, but here is a big commune of other
centipedes. Don't ask such a stupid question to anybody. Perhaps you
have crippled me for my whole life! I will never be able to walk again,
because I don't know how I used to walk. It was simply natural."</p><p>33,000 rules of conduct? Are you trying to drive humanity insane? And
if they don't follow, they feel guilty. If they follow, they look mad.
And if you look at those rules, you will be absolutely aware. For
example, one sannyasin, Buddha's disciple, was going to spread his
message. Buddha said to him, "Never look at a woman. You are going far
away."</p><p>The man said, "It is a little bit difficult, because half the people
are women. Everywhere is full of women, and you are giving me a message
not to look at a</p><p>woman? But how am I supposed to know before looking that a woman is
coming? And by the time I know that she is a woman, I have already
looked." The man raised the question that it would be almost impossible
for him to follow it, Buddha gave him the advice, "No, it is possible. I
will give you the clue. You walk looking just four feet ahead of you, so
if you see a woman's feet, you know. Don't look up, always keep your
eyes glued four feet away." In India, women use ornaments on the feet,
on the toes, and just by looking at the feet you will know it is a
woman.</p><p>The man was a little of a philosopher. He said, "That's okay.
Anything else?" Buddha said, "Never touch a woman." The man said, "But
there can be a situation.… For example, a woman is drowning and I am
standing on the bank. What do you want me to do, jump in the river and
save the woman, or just go on my way without looking at her? A woman may
have fallen on the street sick or old or blind and she needs the help of
someone to take her at least to the nearest town, and I am passing by.
What do you suggest?"</p><p>Buddha said, "Okay, you can touch a woman, but remain absolutely
alert. Keep yourself as a witness, don't get in any way involved. Do it
as if she is only a corpse, and you are fulfilling your duty."</p><p>Now this kind of discipline will soon create disturbances. People are
going to disobey such things and find loopholes and destroy the whole
thing.</p><p>I have not given them anything in which they can find loopholes -- I
have given them only loopholes. Now what can they destroy? It is said a
fishing net consists of holes. I have given them only holes,no fishing
net. Now they can do whatsoever they want to do with holes. I give them
absolute freedom to be themselves. No guilt, no promise, just enjoy the
moment to the fullest, and you</p><p>are not responsible to anybody.</p><p>No God to be responsible towards, no hell to be afraid of, no heaven
to be greedy for. All that is present this very moment, enjoy it
intensely, totally, because no one knows -- the next moment may come,
may not come.</p><p>You want to do something?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU THINK WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT IT'S
KIND OF HARD TO CATEGORIZE YOU, BUT WHAT CONCLUSIONS DO YOU THINK
HISTORY WILL REACH ABOUT YOUR EXPERIMENT HERE?</p><p>A:* I don't know</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* AND FURTHERMORE, YOU DON'T CARE!</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't care. Who cares when you are dead; you are not going to
come back to read what others are writing about you, whether your name
is in the history books or not. What is the point?</p><p>Alexander the Great did so much, tried to conquer the whole known
world, almost succeeded. But what is the point? He died when he was
thirty-three, and after that he has not been seen around -- reading
history and enjoying that his name is everywhere, and he is one of the
greatest heroes in history. What does it matter? I don't know, and I
don't care, either.</p><p>I am perfectly happy right now, so blessed that I can bless the whole
world. Still my blissfulness will not be exhausted.</p><p>Q:* WHY SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD? YOU MENTIONED EARLIER YOUR HAPPINESS
IN YOUR OWN PERSON.… WHY NOT KEEP IT WITHIN YOURSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because it goes on increasing if you share. It is
profit-making.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THERE ARE A FEW GIGGLES THERE. DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY
PROFIT-MAKING.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* The more you share your bliss, your joy, the more it increases.
It is a totally different kind of economics from that which you are
aware of. In the ordinary economics the rule is if you go on sharing
your money, it will decrease.</p><p>In the higher economics, which is my business, the more you share,
the more existence goes on pouring into you. It is just like a well: you
go on drawing water from the well and new water goes on flowing from
everywhere. If you stop drawing water from the well, the water will
become stale, dead, even poisonous. Bliss has to be shared. It is not
out of compassion. That is why I said it is profit- making. It is not
out of compassion that I share my bliss. it is just out of simple profit
motive. It increases the more I share. It is like the rain cloud full of
rain. It has to shower somewhere, otherwise it will become heavy,
burdened.</p><p>Yes, I say, if you don't share your bliss it will go stale. It will
start stinking very soon. It will die. You have to share it to keep it
alive, flowing, increasing, expanding. I am an imperialist. I don't
believe in any limits on anything.</p><p>I can understanding why you are scratching your beard. You don't have
a beard and you are scratching it. You take a few grapes -- that will
help you. That scratching is nervous. You just take some grapes! Those
grapes are there just to avoid doing anything else that shows
nervousness.</p><p>But it is something new. All journalists feel nervous, because they
have never met such a crazy man before. Who will not feel nervous? You
take a few grapes.</p><p>Q:* I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOW ME A MEAL BREAK UNTIL I'M OFF WORK.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Okay.</p><p>Q:* WHY IS IT IMPORTANT, OR WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO SELL BLISS, WHY
CAN'T YOU GIVE IT AWAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. Because anything that is just given away is never taken by
anybody. The higher the cost, the better people will keep it, save it in
their treasuries. Give it free, and it has no value, because people
don't understand value unless it has a price. They understand price,
they don't understand value.</p><p>Q:* IN THAT CASE, HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE
GRAPES?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* SO, NO VALUE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I know that if you eat those grapes your program is going to be
for me. Just taste something sweet, so you are not bitter on television.
It is all profit-making business! I am a very simple man, and truthful.
If you are shy about eating right now, when I go, please.…</p><p><br></p><p>[the cameraman has problems]</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT SOME OF THE WORDS YOU JUST
SAID... WHY BLISS HAS TO BE SOLD. WHY YOU SELL BLISS.</p><p>COULD YOU GRANT US THREE MORE MINUTES?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I can, but I cannot repeat what I have said; I will say something
else. I don't believe in repetition.</p><p>Everything in this world has to be achieved. You have to pay a price
for it, and the bigger the price you pay for it, the higher is your
estimate of it. If bliss, ecstasy, joy, were all available, like water,
free -- nobody will be able to appreciate their value.</p><p>You don't know the real value of water unless you have been thirsty
in a desert. While he was in India, Alexander was asked by a great
Master, "If you are in a desert and thirsty and I have a full bottle of
water, how much will you be ready to pay for it?" Alexander said, "I
will pay half my empire in such a situation." But the Master said, "I
will not sell until you pay me the full empire. Why should I sell? If
you are willing to pay half, that is indication enough that if I just
wait a little more, the customer is going to feel more thirsty and is
going to pay the full empire."</p><p>And Alexander agreed that perhaps he would give the whole empire. And
the Master laughed. He said, "Then what are you doing? Wasting your
whole life for a bottle of water? Are you stupid or something?"</p><p>The world understands things in its own way. Otherwise, my bliss is
freely available to anybody who can appreciate it, who is vulnerable to
it, who is open to receive it. There is no price tag on it. But those
who cannot understand anything unless they pay for it -- for those poor
people, we have to put a price on everything. It is out of
compassion.</p><p>That's why I said my answer will not be the same. Q:* BHAGWAN, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.</p><p>A:* I enjoyed it.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-22>The Last Testament, Vol 1

interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH THE RAJNEESH TIMES, TOKYO</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION:* BELOVED BHAGWAN, BUDDHA THE JAPANESE SEEMS QUITE
CONCEIVABLE, YET, ZORBA THE JAPANESE QUITE INCONCEIVABLE. WOULD YOU
COMMENT?</p><p>ANSWER:* It is one of the most significant questions to ask. Buddha
is not only conceivable in Japan, a Buddhist country, Buddha will be
conceivable anywhere, even though the countries are not Buddhist.
Perhaps Buddha is the only human being in the whole history who is
loved, respected by ALL, not only by Buddhists.</p><p>On the other hand, Zorba is inconceivable in every old culture,
civilization, religion, because they all have condemned materialism and
they all have raised spiritualism to its ultimate height. They have
created a duality between matter and spirit, between the mundane and the
sacred.</p><p>Zorba represents all that has been condemned for centuries upon
centuries by all the religions. Buddha is loved certainly by Buddhists,
but respected by non- Buddhists, too. He represents something of the
purity of the highest conceivable spirituality. That's why I say the
question is significant.</p><p>My whole effort is to bring Zorba and Buddha closer and closer -- so
close that both can exist in one human being without any contradiction,
as complementaries, helping each other, not fighting with each
other.</p><p>Separately, both are missing much. Buddha is absolutely bloodless,
just a skeleton, because he has denied everything that life is. Life is
love, life is laughter. Buddha has denied everything. He is just a
skeleton. Zorba is full of life, love, laughter. Eat, drink, and be
merry is his whole religion. He does not know anything beyond eat,
drink, and be merry. He does not know ... he has no question or
curiosity about something that is higher -- higher than the alcohol,
higher than the woman or man, higher than this world, the visible world,
the tangible world.</p><p>Zorba has no quest; he is perfectly happy drinking, dancing,
enjoying. Buddha is missing the blood, the life, the love, the joy, the
celebration. Buddha cannot dance. It will be simply inconceivable,
Buddha dancing. Zorba cannot sit silently</p><p>and meditate. That, too, is as inconceivable as Buddha dancing. Zorba
is dancing, singing, drinking. He is making love to any woman, who by
chance meets him.</p><p>Zorba represents the materialist in its best form. Buddha represents
the spiritualist in its best form. but you are both, spirit and body.
Existence is both, matter and consciousness.</p><p>Therefore I say that spiritualists have been denying the very base of
the temple. They accept the temple but they deny the foundation of the
temple, and without the foundation, no temple can stand. That's why
religions have failed.</p><p>Gautam the Buddha has failed, for the simple reason that he was
trying to make a temple without any foundations going down into the
earth. He was trying to grow roses, but he was not ready to accept the
roots under the ground which life in darkness and, of course, are not as
beautiful as the roses. But neither the roses can exist without the
roots, nor the roots can afford to exist without the flowers. The roots
without the flowers will be barren, and the flowers without the roots
can only be of plastic. so all the religions of the past have created a
plastic humanity. Denying Zorba, they have denied all that is solid in
you. And the materialists, communists, Marxists and other brands of
materialism -- Epicurus in Greece, Charvaka in India -- they are eating,
drinking, womanizing, but at the very end they find nothing but
frustration.</p><p>Something is missing. They may have all the money, all the power,
everything that a man can ask for, but still inside they are empty,
hollow. They may be dancing, but their dance has nothing of divinity in
it. Their dance is just an exercise of the body. There is no soul to
it.</p><p>These are the two ways humanity has lived up to now -- divided,
split, schizophrenic, both have to repress something. Buddha has to
repress Zorba. Zorba has to repress Buddha. As far as I'm concerned,
both are sick because both are half of one whole, which can be healthy
only if both the parts meet together and fill the gaps. Zorba can become
the foundation, Buddha can become the temple.</p><p>I don't see that there is any conflict between the rose and the
roots. On the contrary, the roots are continuously sending food, water,
nourishment, color, fragrance to the rose. the rose is on the receiving
end. All that the rose gives to you comes from the roots. Cut the roots
away, and the rose dies, disappears. All fragrance, all life, all dance
in the wind ... the joy in the sun ... simply withers away. Take the
roses away, and what meaning is left for the roots?</p><p>That's why materialism is bound to come to a point where it feels
meaningless, everything meaningless. It is the Zorba in the West which
has come to its climax in the so-called philosophy of existentialism.
Existentialism is the ultimate logical conclusion of Zorba. There is no
meaning in life according to European existentialism. There is only
anxiety, anguish, despair. Zorba had started with love, laughter, life,
and it is strange that in the end the conclusion is that there is only
one way to get rid of it all, this whole mess and madness, and that is
suicide.</p><p>The whole Western intelligence is in a great insane space, because
they have accepted only the roots and now they are asking, "Where are
the flowers?" They never allowed the flowers to grow. On the contrary,
they went on cutting the branches, the leaves, the trunk of the tree,
and now they are asking the roots, "What is the meaning of you? For what
do you exist?"</p><p>And in the East, just the opposite has happened: only the spiritual
is true, and the material is illusory. All the spiritual masters in the
East have been emphasizing only one thing: that the world in which you
live is only a dream. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor --
what does it matter if it is only a dream? Whether you are hungry, sick,
old, healthy, it is only a dream. It is not the reality.</p><p>The natural consequence was, that in saving their spirit and their
spirituality they have lost their roots. That's why the East is poor.
Gautam Buddha is responsible for it. If you deny materialism, then how
can science develop? If matter is illusory,then the whole scientific
endeavor is illusory -- Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never happened, it
was just the Japanese dreaming about it. If matter is illusory, then how
can the atom be real, which is the constituent of matter? And if life is
illusory,then why make so much fuss about life disappearing from the
earth in a third world war.</p><p>Because Gautam Buddha and the people like him in other religions
emphasized only the other world, this world was neglected, ignored. No
science was developed, although it could have been developed long before
it started to develop in the West. The Western development of science is
only of the last three hundred years. Mathematics was discovered in
India ten thousand years ago, but what happened? Guns and dynamite were
discovered in China five thousand years ago, but then what went wrong?
In three hundred years the West has developed nuclear weapons, and they
have managed to reach to the moon. What has the East been doing for ten
thousand years?</p><p>You will be surprised to know that when Marco Polo came back from
China, he brought from the Chinese emperor many presents for the pope.
He was laughed at about everything that he brought, and he thought he
was bringing something of immense value. For example, up to that time,
the West had no idea of printing machines, and he had brought printed
books from china. The West had no idea of currency notes, but in China
currency notes had been in use for three thousand years.</p><p>What went wrong? People who invented mathematics, people who invented
printing presses, people who invented guns and gunpowder...? The whole
responsibility goes to Gautam Buddha and his type of people. They
emphasized that all this is illusory -- don't waste time. The small time
that you have got has not to be wasted in the desert of materialism. You
should devote your whole life to the search for truth, for that which is
far above what you see. Seek the invisible, the intangible. Seek the
eternal, the immortal. Seek the immaterial.</p><p>Emphasis from people like Buddha who had charismatic personalities
influenced the whole of civilization, and for centuries all progress
stopped. India knew everything about mathematics, but could not produce
an Albert Einstein. If things had moved rightly, India would have
reached to faraway stars by this time, not just to the moon. The moon is
very close. If Western science can reach to the moon in three hundred
years, India cold have reached to the farthest star in ten thousand
years. All the basic principles of mathematics were known, but they were
never applied. They remained theoretical. They remained undeveloped
because the genius of the country was attracted by Gautam Buddha,
Mahavira, Shankara, who were emphasizing that matter is illusory,that
this life is just a dream, and the only use you can make of this life is
to find that which remains forever.</p><p>Naturally, the East has remained poor. Nobody else is responsible for
it. it was bound to happen. If I had been there at Buddha's time, I
would have predicted that what he was teaching would result in poverty,
sickness and death to the same people who were influenced by him. And
remember, when people are poor, hungry, dying, do you think they can
meditate? With a hungry stomach, can you go on sitting silently and let
the grass grow by itself?</p><p>Basho's stomach was full when he wrote those lines. He must have
begged and eaten well. Then, sitting under a tree by the side of a pond,
he could write beautiful poetry of tremendous significance. But we
should not forget that Basho was not hungry. If he had been hungry, then
there was no possibility of these beautiful lines coming out of him.</p><p>"The ancient pond, the frog jumps in. The sound." Or, the silence. It
is difficult to translate exactly the Japanese word, because Japanese
has no alphabet. In India, we have a word,which is pronounced "chapak,"
-- the sound of the frog. When a frog jumps into the pond, there is
something like chapak.</p><p>But these beautiful statements are not out of a hungry stomach. The
East went on becoming poorer and poorer, because without technology and
science you cannot be rich. And if Ethiopia is dying today -- almost one
thousand people per day are dying, and in the last four years, millions
have died in Ethiopia -- who is responsible for these people dying
there? Why have they not been able to develop enough technology and
science to create and produce wealth? Because wealth was condemned by
their religious leaders and the people listened to their religious
leaders. Wealth was condemned. Children were declared to be gifts of
God, so they went on producing only one thing: children. Now, no child
brings with him a piece of land, seeds for the new crop, water to
nourish the plants. God goes on sending children without any equipment
to be here, and the religious leaders go on saying they are gifts of
God, but they have proved to be the very curses against humanity.</p><p>The East was bound to remain poor because of Gautam Buddha. It was
bound to remain unprogressive, backward, because of Gautam Buddha. And I
love the man; you can understand my anguish that I have to say that
Gautam Buddha is</p><p>responsible for this whole misery. For twenty-five centuries,
millions of people have suffered, have gone mad, have become perverted
-- and the man who is responsible for it, I love him.</p><p>I love Zorba, too, but I know it is because of the materialists we
have suffered two world wars and now the third is impending to destroy
the whole humanity at any moment. Because of Zorbas, the West has
remained superficial. Yes, its stomach is full, perhaps much too full,
but its being is empty. The house is really beautiful, a palace, but
nobody lives there. It is empty. Yes, there are precious paintings on
the walls and great sculptures in the garden. Everything is immensely
valuable, but nobody lives there; nobody IS there, because the
materialist forgot completely to come back home. He went out, and out,
and out, and went on searching farther and farther away from his home
base. Now he has completely forgotten who he is, where he comes from.
Now he is asking, what is the meaning of my life, what I am searching,
what I am going here, what the hell am I doing here? He is angry, angry
at life itself.</p><p>In one of Dostoevsky's novels, THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV there are three
brothers. One brother is an atheist, one brother is a very pious
religious innocent person, and the third brother simply does not care
about either. The atheist says: If I meet your God, Ivan -- Ivan is the
religious one -- if I meet that fellow anywhere, the first thing I am to
do is to return the ticket, and ask the gentleman, "Is it right to send
me into a world without asking my permission? Who are you? What
authority have you got to force me to live a life which is meaningless?
And everything that is joyful, you and your representatives condemn it.
You have done a great job of creating. You create us without asking us.
That is the first crime you have committed. Then you give us instincts
which we have not asked for and send your prophets and messiahs who
condemn those instincts saying that sex is sin, that attachment is sin,
that possessions are sin. So what kind of game is going on? Are you some
kind of a sadist? Have you created us to suffer? Are you enjoying our
suffering and misery?"</p><p>That brother is speaking for the whole West. Everything is available,
but what is the point? You will go on making love to this woman, to that
man, but what is the point? After a few experiences, you simply look
silly. What are you doing? You may eat in this restaurant,in that
restaurant -- Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian spaghetti -- but
sooner or later you are bound to recognize what is going on. What is the
point of it all? Why should I go on living tomorrow, because again
tomorrow, spaghetti?</p><p>It is enough for any intelligent man -- and the more intelligent a
man is, the sooner he gets bored. Retarded people can go on living with
a woman or with a man their whole life. But intelligent people, the
greater their intelligence, the greater is their capacity to see that
there are thousand of beautiful women. Why remain with one? There are
thousands of beautiful men, so why cling to one? There is no natural law
that you have to remain clinging to one. Why create a bondage?</p><p>But even if a man goes on moving from one woman to another, soon he
gets tired and founds out that he is in a vicious circle. Finally he
finds to his great surprise that all women are exactly the same. What
you call making love -- whether you make love to Cleopatra or Mother
Teresa -- it is the same, the same stupid thing. So the whole West has
created the foundation of the temple, but a foundation is meaningless
without a temple. They go on making foundations, and then they are
stuck: "What are we doing? For what are we making this foundation?" They
don't have any idea that a temple has to be created. They have denied
that temple for centuries: there is no consciousness.</p><p>Karl Marx says, "Consciousness is only a by-product of matter." See
the point: Shankara, Buddha and Mahavira say that matter is illusory,
that consciousness is immortal reality. Charvaka, Epicurus, and Karl
Marx say just the opposite, that matter is the ONLY reality and
consciousness is only a by-product.</p><p>It is just like a clock on the wall that goes on clicking, giving you
time. If you bring an aboriginal into the room and show the clock
moving, he will look all around and say, "Where is the spirit of the
clock?" Because if it moves, there must be a mover hidden inside. But
there is no mover, the movement is a by product of a certain mechanism.
You can take apart all the parts. Do you think the soul of the clock
goes upwards to meet God? If it was a good clock, giving the right time
all the time, it will go to God; if it was a bad clock, giving the wrong
time all the time, it will go down into hell to suffer. But you know
there is nobody who is going anywhere. You can put those parts together
again, and the clock starts clicking. that clicking of the clock is just
a by-product.</p><p>The West denied consciousness; the result is a tremendous feeling of
despair. The East denied matter; the result is Ethiopia, India. Half a
million people are going to die out of poverty this year. Two million
people will be barely able to survive. You cannot tell them that being
barely able to survive will be life.</p><p>And who knows about the next year? Right now the world population is
four billion. In every decade we are producing one billion people, so by
the time this century ends, we will be nearabout six billion people. Our
resources are being exhausted, and this increase of population will be
happening in the poor countries,not in the rich countries. The poor
countries will become poorer, much porer, and it will be impossible for
richer countries to give any help. And why should they give? The poor
don't give their meditation to the rich. They don't give their
experiences of ecstasy, blissfulness to the rich. Why should the rich
give the fruits of their technology to the poor? They are going to be in
difficulty themselves, because they are piling up nuclear weapons.</p><p>This is where Zorba has brought them. Sooner or later nuclear weapons
are going to destroy the world. Yes, they will die with their stomachs
full. In fact, half a million people only in America suffer from
obesity, fatness. They go on growing like monsters. They don't have
anything else to do except eat. Eat more. A small child, an American,
was puzzled why the Ethiopians go on dying. He told his father that it
seems so stupid that one thousand people are dying every</p><p>day, starving. Why don't they open their fridges? If there is nothing
else available, they can eat cakes, biscuits.</p><p>Now, the American child cannot conceive a home without a fridge. What
a distance we have created amongst human beings! The Ethiopian has never
seen a fridge and perhaps will never see one. There seems to be no way
for Ethiopia to survive.</p><p>Zorba has brought half of the world to where they have everything.
Only the man is missing, the spirit is missing -- and with the spirit,
all meaning, all ecstasy, all joy, everything has gone down the drain.
In the East, they are poor, dying, sick, suffering in every possible
way, and that is the consequence of what Buddha has been teaching to
these people.</p><p>I want East and West to disappear into each other. I want Zorba and
buddha to disappear into each other. Only then will we have a whole man,
and the whole man is the need of the day. It is because of this that I
am going to be condemned from both sides. The religious people will
condemn me as a materialist; and the materialists, the communists are
condemning me for diverting peoples' minds towards meditation. That
means the young generation is being diverted away from the revolution,
that I am serving in some way the interests of capitalism.</p><p>I am the greatest danger to them, because I am attracting so many
young people. If they had not come to me, they would be communists. But
now the situation has come to such a point that red no longer represents
the communists, it represents me.</p><p>They both are angry: Zorba is angry, Buddha is angry. But I am not to
be stopped by either. I am going to put both of them into a mixture and
put the electricity on, so that when the juice comes out, you cannot
find which is Buddha and which is Zorba. That is my sannyasins: one who
will live with intensity and totality like Zorba. But that is not the
end, that is only the beginning. He will go on searching, seeking for
something higher to live, something better to live. He will be in favor
of science and technology. He will not deny this world. He will not call
it a dream. It is true -- as true as anything can be. Who can say roots
are untrue? Just to prove that roses are true, have you to prove roots
to be illusory? I don't see the point. Roots are roots, and as roots
they are real. Roses are roses; as roses, they are real. The problem is
that they are joined together and they depend on each other.</p><p>I have told you that juices are flowing continuously from the roots
towards the flower; but it is not a one way affair. the flower is taking
the sun rays deep down to the roots. Because those roots are
underground, they also need the life that sun rays give. Without those
sun rays, those roots wil die. The flower does not open for you to make
a garland, it opens for the roots which are hidden. In fact, it is an
extension, a hand of the roots to catch hold of life and energy from the
sun, the wind, the rain,and send it back to the roots which are hidden
deep down. It is a two way traffic.</p><p>And this is how it should be between Zorba and Buddha. If Buddha has
eyes -- and certainly he has eyes -- but he doesn't have legs, what is
he going to do with his eyes? The house is on fire.He can see it. He can
see the way out, but he doesn't have legs, he is crippled. And somebody
is sitting by his side who is blind, but has strong legs.</p><p>I am suggesting a simple thing: get introduced to each other! Tell
each other what you have got and what you have not got. It is a simple
thing to come to an understanding that the crippled man, who can see,
sits on the shoulders of the strong man, who is blind but who can walk.
Now they are together, functioning as one unit. One sees and shows the
way, and the other follows -- that's the only way to get out of the
house which is on fire.</p><p>And we ARE in the house which is on fire. It is exactly the right
moment when Zorba and Buddha should drop all their antagonism and become
one.</p><p>Yes, Zorba is blind, but he is a strong person. Buddha has eyes, but
he is fragile. He can sit under the bodhi tree, but if the jungle takes
fire, perhaps he will not be able to escape.</p><p>It had happened in Buddha's life.… I have been to that place near
Bodhgaya, where Buddha became enlightened. There is a small river,
Niranjana. Buddha was so weak because of fasting, meditating. He had
devoted everything to meditation. He had forgotten his body, he had
forgotten everything else. He went to take a bath in Niranjana. It is a
small river. When I went there, I could not believe -- perhaps at that
time it may have been a little bigger river -- but the story is that he
was so weak that the current of the river started carrying him away and
he could not manage to stand against that small river's current. He
tried hard somehow to get out, and had to hang onto the root of a tree
on the side of the river. He had to rest for a time to gather energy
enough to get out of the river.</p><p>This situation, this story, is the story of the whole East. Yes,
Buddha has got eyes. He can see as far as existence is. His vision is
limitless but he has done one thing wrong: he has gone against the body,
against nature. His achievement is partial. So is the achievement of
Zorba partial.</p><p>Remember one thing: truth can only be the whole. It is just like a
circle. You cannot draw half a circle. That is not possible. Just the
word circle means FULL- CIRCLE. You cannot draw half a circle. That will
be only an arc, not a circle. A circle has to be whole. And that's the
situation about truth: truth has to be whole. Half a truth is worse than
a lie.</p><p>Buddha is half of the truth, and Zorba is half of the truth. It is
going to be difficult to explain to Buddhist that I am making an effort
to create a synthesis between Zorba and Buddha. They may feel offended,
but that does not matter. Truth is on my side, and I am ready for an
open discussion with both Buddha and Zorba. And my vision is so clear
that both are half and both have disturbed the whole humanity.</p><p>Now it is time for Zorba the Buddha to appear. Perhaps I am the first
Zorba the Buddha. I take the responsibility of bringing this new kind of
animal into the world. And my sannyasins have to be Zorba the Buddha.
Nothing has to be sacrificed, and everything has to be experienced. From
body to soul, from earth to sky, all is ours.</p><p>Q:* THE PROBLEMS OF SOUTH AFRICA ARE BASICALLY REFLECTED IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS JAPANESE. WE ARE ACCEPTABLE IN BUSINESS,
BUT CULTURALLY WE ARE CONSIDERED COLORED AND HAVE SEMI-HUMAN STATUS. IS
THERE ANY SOLUTION POSSIBLE IN SOUTH AFRICA?</p><p>A:* South Africa is not a big problem. Like all problems it is very
simple, but the vested interests make everything complex. In South
Africa only fifteen percent of the population is white, and these
fifteen percent white are invaders. Eighty-five percent of the people,
the natives of the land, have been living in slavery for centuries. They
are simply slaves, servants, working in the coal mines, gold mines,
diamond mines. Those mines belong to them, but they get only a little
bit of money to survive. And the fifteen percent white people exploit
their rich country, and have been doing so for three hundred years.</p><p>Now it has come to the point where something has to be done, but the
problem is that these fifteen percent whites came three hundred years
ago, and now they don't have anywhere to go. There are Dutch people,
English people, Italians. There are others, but the majority is Dutch.
Their own countries are not ready to accept them back, because no
country wants its population to grow suddenly. Somehow they are keeping
things in balance. Neither do these people really want to go back,
because in their own countries they will be ordinary second-rate
citizens. Maybe clerks, waiters, porters, while in South Africa, they
are kings. All their investment is in South Africa. All the technology
that they have brought, all the mechanism is in the mines of South
Africa, and they know how much more is still there to be exploited. They
have only scratched the surface. This is their greed and their fear of
going back to their own countries where they will be almost
foreigners.</p><p>They have started calling themselves Afrikaaner, they don't call
themselves Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish. No, they have
become a new race: Afrikaaner, and they call their language Afrikaans.
They don't want to leave and I can understand the human greed. I can
also understand their problem of who is going to accept them. Nobody is
willing to accept them, but that does not mean they have to continue to
exploit eighty-five percent of the people, their country, their land;
nor that they have to go on being the ruling ones.</p><p>It is strange that in the twentieth century only the fifteen percent,
the white people, have the voting right in South Africa. The eighty-five
percent majority</p><p>has no voting right, so the question of their coming into power does
not arise. They have nothing to do with power. They can't even vote. It
is inhuman.</p><p>I can see the difficulty of the white people; I can see the
exploitation of the black people, but it cannot continue the way it has
up to now. It has come to a point of explosion. Now there is emergency
rule. The whole country is under military rule, and South Africa has one
of the biggest armies in the world. No journalist is allowed in, so
nobody knows how many people are being killed and burned every day.</p><p>My suggestion is simple: fifteen percent of the land should become a
new country -- Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the wealth should go to
the new country, Afrikaaner. Fifteen percent of the army should go to
the new country, Afrikaaner. Everything according to the percentage,
with South Africa divided into two countries, Afrikaaner and South
Africa.</p><p>It is so simple, if people really want to solve the problem. The
white people should remain there. They have been there for three hundred
years, and their old countries are not going to accept them back. It is
enough time. But they should get according to their percentage. if they
don't want to divide the country, then the eighty-five percent majority
should be given the voting right. Naturally then the government will be
of native South Africans.</p><p>These are two clear alternatives. And I think the white people will
prefer the first. They would have at least fifteen percent of the
country -- fifteen percent of its wealth, diamond mines, gold mines, and
fifteen percent of the army -- and they would be their own rulers. And
the native eighty-five percent of the people would have eighty-five
percent of the army, eighty-five percent of the wealth, eighty-five
percent of the land, and would be their own kings. I don't see a problem
at all. They just have to sit with each other and find out the way to
divide.</p><p>If the ruling minority insist that they don't want division, then
they must give the eighty-five percent majority their voting rights. But
then they will not have even the fifteen percent that was possible in
the first place, because the native majority will throw them out of the
government. Then they will be at the natives' service. Those natives who
have served you for three hundred years -- now you serve them. they have
worked in your mines and died -- now you work and die.</p><p>The whole world should insist that either of these two alternatives
has to be accepted; otherwise, the South African government simply will
be rejected by all the governments of the world. They should be thrown
out of UNO. They have no right to represent a country where eighty-five
percent of the people are against them. They should not be given any
support. All businesses from other countries should be completely
stopped. The present government should be forced either to accept the
first conclusion, or accept the second alternative.</p><p>And I think the first is perfectly beautiful. They don't lose; they
get as much as they deserve, fifteen percent. The native South Africans
don't lose anything, they get as much as they deserve. One just needs
the clarity to see. But this is the</p><p>problem: even when things are very simple, millions of people have to
die, innocent people have to suffer. The idiotic politicians and
power-hungry people go on massacring poor innocent children, women, old
people.</p><p>In South Africa the army now is given the power to shoot anybody they
suspect. No inquiry is needed; no arrest warrant is needed; no court has
to decide. The military itself has all the powers to shoot ANYBODY, and
suspicion is not something that you can later prove wrong or right.
Whether it was wrong or right, it makes no difference -- it was not a
certainty, it was only a suspicion. So now they are killing anybody they
want to kill. It is the responsibility of the whole world to reject
South Africa as a member of civilized humanity, because what they are
doing is barbarous.</p><p>But even countries like America that are supposed to be the most
advanced, progressive, democratic countries do things which are
inconceivable. In the Second World War, when Japanese armies attached
Pearl Harbor, one and one- half million Japanese -- who were living in
America, who were American citizens, who had been living here for
generations, and most of whom were born in America -- were given fifteen
days notice to sell their properties, land, everything, and move to a
special place that the American government was providing for them.</p><p>And the whole of America was kept in darkness. Even today that part
is not mentioned in books of history about the Second World War.</p><p>In fact, all around the world, nobody knows what actually happened to
those one and one-half million Japanese-Americans. Fifteen days was such
a short notice -- how could you sell your businesses, your houses, your
lands? -- and who is going to purchase them when the local buyers knew
that within fifteen days you will have to go, that the lands, the
buildings, your car, your shop, your business, everything will be left
in their hands, free? Why purchase?</p><p>These one and one-half million Japanese-Americans who had earned all
this with their own labor with their own intelligence, were really rich
people. The Japanese have the knack of becoming rich; they know how to
create wealth.</p><p>They had to leave, and they were not supposed to ask why or where
they were going. Just one thing was told to them -- that the American
government suspected that when America and Japan were at war they might
favor Japan. And in a democratic country, the government had not a
single proof that a single Japanese in America supported Japan. Out of
one and one-half million people, they could not find a single proof that
anyone was really or willing to support Japan.</p><p>They were ready to support and fight for America because they
considered America their country; but they were taken into isolation in
the desert where they were told that they would be taken care of on a
reservation, just like the Red Indians. But it was not a reservation.
Now facts have become available: it was the same kind of concentration
camp that Adolf Hitler had created in Germany for Jews.</p><p>After the Second World War, the people who had been running those
concentration camps in Germany were punished, but America was not
punished even though they had behaved in the same way with absolutely
innocent Japanese-Americans who were not in favor of Japan. They were
tortured, no medical facilities were given, their food was not up to
standard, and they were crushed like sub-human beings.</p><p>When they were brought back after the war, their properties were not
returned, and have not been returned even yet. And this is a democracy!
During the whole period of wartime, America was not able to find any
proof to support their actions. When the Japanese-Americans were
released, their businesses were in American hands, their cars were in
American hands, Americans had taken over everything without giving a
single paise in compensation.</p><p>Now forty years have passed and those Japanese-Americans are still
asking the American government: "Give us some compensation. It was your
duty.You forced us and we had not committed any crime, and you don't
have a single case against us." And it is not a small thing -- one and a
half million people and their properties -- and the American government
is silent.</p><p>That's why I say that civilization has yet to come. It has not yet
happened. There are only pretenders, hypocrites, but not truly
democratic people anywhere. America is different from the Soviet Union
only in hypocrisy. The Soviet Union is straightforward, a dictatorship.
America IS a dictatorship proclaiming itself as a democracy, and now we
can say it from our own experience.</p><p>For four years, Rajneeshees have been harassed by the American
government -- the state government, the federal government -- without
any legal reason on their part to support their acts against us. All
their laws are in our favor and their constitution is in our favor,
because from the very beginning I have made it clear to my people not to
do anything knowingly or unknowingly against the American constitution;
that it is the only constitution which at least accepts democracy,
accepts freedom of speech, accepts respect for the individual -- so
don't do anything.</p><p>We have not done anything against the constitution, but still we are
being harassed in every possible way. They are taking advantage of all
kinds of laws, which have never been applied to anyone in the whole
history of America. Suddenly those laws have become applicable to us,
and those laws go against the American constitution. So now my new stand
is that we will fight the American government in Oregon, and if needed,
then the federal government, to save the American constitution. We are
for the American constitution and its values, and even if we have to
fight with the Americans themselves, we will fight to the very end --
because that constitution is the only hope for humanity some day to
become democratic, some day to become really civilized and human. Okay,

words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH NATHAN WOOD, THE ROGERS CABLE SYSTEM, PORTLAND,
OREGON</p><p>QUESTION:* YOU LOOK VERY NICE IN BLUE. IS THAT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE
COLORS?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER:* All colors are my favorites, except red. Q:* DO YOU SEE A
LOT OF RED AROUND HERE?</p><p>A:* Your tie!. That is a lot.</p><p>Q:* WHY DO THESE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SO MUCH? WHY ARE YOU SO
APPEALING?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am also wondering.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IS IT THE BEARD OR THE MONEY OR THE PRESTIGE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't have any money. I don't have any prestige. I am notorious
all over the world. What prestige can I have? To be with me needs
courage. To be with a notorious man... you will lose your prestige if
you are with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHY IS THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because I am notorious. You need not do anything; you just be
with me and you will lose your prestige, your respectability, your
service. Everything will be gone.</p><p>They love me because I love them, and they cannot love me more than I
love them. The love of all my sannyasins around the world is put on one
side of a scale and my love for them on the other side, I'm going to be
weightier.</p><p>Q:* WHEN OR IF YOU DO PASS AWAY, OR IF YOU DIED, IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED, WHO WOULD TAKE OVER? WOULD THERE BE SOMEONE TO TAKE OVER? WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN TO RAJNEESHPURAM IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Let me start from some point.… I have been waiting my whole life
for somebody to ask it, but nobody asks me what will happen to me when I
die. Nobody is worried about that.</p><p>I will be dying and you will be living here. The whole trouble and
the journey into the unknown is for me. Nobody seems to be concerned
about that; everybody is concerned about those who will be left behind,
living. What kind of minds have human beings got? Very egocentric. I am
dying and even at my last breath you will be asking, "What will happen
to all these people who will be living?" Nobody will ask, "Bhagwan,
forget all about us. We will be living and you are going on an unknown
pilgrimage. What can we do for you?"</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT KIND OF A PILGRIMAGE WOULD YOU BE GOING ON WHEN YOU DIE?</p><p>A:* Whatever kind of pilgrimage, when one is dying at least he is out
of this world, out of this life, out of all that is known. He is moving
into the dark and the unknown and the unfathomable. If you really love
the person you will be concerned about him. But the trouble is that
everybody is concerned about himself, although you will be living and I
will be dying.</p><p>Q:* WHAT COULD WE DO THEN? WHAT COULD WE THE LIVING DO TO HELP?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* At least you could ask the question. But for my whole life I have
been waiting and nobody has asked it. I am simply pointing at the fact
of how egocentric man is. Now your question.…</p><p>My whole teaching is centered on the present moment, this moment. I
do not care for any tomorrows. In the first place, the tomorrow never
comes; whatever comes is always the now. You are never there, you are
always here. Existence knows only two words, now and here.</p><p>I have heard about an atheist who was very much against God. To
remind himself and his clients, his children, his wife, his friends, he
had written in his sitting room in big bold letter, "God is
nowhere."</p><p>Then a child is born the the atheist, a small child. He starts
growing and learning. Learning the alphabet, he reads the sentence, "God
is nowhere." But nowhere is such a big word for him that he splits the
word in two. He reads, "God is now here." That mistake transformed the
whole mind of his father. For the first time he could see that nowhere
consists of now and here.</p><p>Existence is now and here. I have never bothered about the future.
When I leave the body these people will celebrate, as we celebrate
everything. And I have no responsibility for them, so the question of
anybody succeeding me does not arise. The successor is needed only when
I am having any responsibility. I have no responsibility. My approach is
that everybody is responsible for his own life.</p><p>In this commune they are not here to dump their responsibility on me;
they are here to learn how to stop dumping responsibility on others, how
to take the whole responsibility of life on one's own shoulders. That's
what gives a man dignity, integrity, self. For the first time he feels
he is. And the responsibility makes him free of all kinds of slaveries,
enslavements.</p><p>So, I'm not going to say what they have to do when I am gone. That is
manipulating people even when you are dead. Moses is still manipulating
the Jews. He was not satisfied while alive. While alive he tortured his
people for forty years in the Middle East desert in search of some holy
land.</p><p>Q:* SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE BIBLE IS ACCURATE IN SPEAKING OF MOSES,
OR IS THAT A MYTH?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* The BIBLE is just fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU MENTIONED GOD JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT
YOU CONCEPT OF GOD IS. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKED THAT SO MANY TIMES,
BUT.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* My concept is exactly whole because I can read nowhere; I don't
have to cut words in two. God is nowhere.</p><p>Q:* GOD IS NOWHERE. I WAS WONDERING THAT, BECAUSE WHEN...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, wait, don't wonder, let me finish. Moses tortured Jews for
forty years. Almost seventy-five percent of his followers died in that
stupid search for a holy land. And finally, not because they had found
the holy land, but just to save face, he declared Israel to be the holy
land. Now there is nothing holy in Israel! And Moses gave commandments
to them to be followed after he is gone. The same was done by Mohammed,
by Buddha. They were too much concerned about what their people are
going to do when they are gone.</p><p>It is something of tremendous importance that they were so much
concerned. The reason is that in their presence they have persuaded the
disciples to repress every natural instinct. Sex has to be repressed and
they have to be celibate. Under their influence and charismatic
personality people have accepted something absolutely unnatural. Only an
impotent man can be celibate; and no impotent man has been known to
become enlightened, not yet. He has no energy in him. Enlightenment will
need a tremendous explosion of energy. He cannot</p><p>even create a child; how can he create himself in a totally luminous
way? So no impotent man has ever become enlightened.</p><p>And all the people who became enlightened were really over-sexual. In
fact their over-sexuality was one of the causes for their enlightenment.
They had so much energy that the woman was not enough. Many women were
also not enough. They had such a great energy that they wanted to make
love to the whole existence itself, and that's what enlightenment is,
and orgiastic experience with existence itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE YOU ENLIGHTENED?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes.</p><p>Q:* HOW ENLIGHTENED. ARE YOU VERY ENLIGHTENED?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There are no quantities in enlightenment; either you are
enlightened or you are not enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AS FAR AS OTHER RELIGIONS.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, I have not answered your first question. You asked me what I
am thinking about these people after I am gone. I am not even thinking
now, when I am here.</p><p>I am giving them total freedom. I have not enforced anything on them
that will make me afraid that once I am gone these celibates are going
to create trouble. I have not repressed anything. If they want to smoke,
I tell them to smoke the best cigar possible -- don't go for anything
second rate. If you want to love, find out the best man, the best woman,
and go into it as totally as possible. I am in support of expression and
all the so-called religions were in support of repression. When you
repress people you are certainly afraid that when you are gone there is
going to be chaos.</p><p>That problem does not exist for me. When I am gone there is going to
be no chaos because chaos was all that I have been training my people
for. My commune is a chaos and yet a very organic chaos, a very creative
chaos, a chaos out of which stars are born. That's why that kind of
question becomes very difficult for me to answer. I am not giving them
any discipline, any rules of conduct. I am simply teaching them to be
aware, alert, to be independent. Take your responsibility and do
whatsoever you want to do. Don't bother about Moses, or Jesus, or
Buddha, or me.</p><p>Jesus lived his way; he never bothered about others. If he had
bothered about others; the Jews would never have crucified him. Buddha
never bothered about anybody. I don't accept anybody as my master or my
leader. I am nobody's</p><p>shadow, nobody's carbon copy, and that's what I am teaching to my
people: Don't be anybody's carbon copy, including me.</p><p>So, alive, dance with me, rejoice with me. When I am gone continue to
dance and rejoice in remembrance of a man who gave you freedom, who gave
you individuality. What else is there to bother about the future?
Wherever I am -- somewhere I must be -- I will go on showering my love
on my people and I know they will find ways to respond. But that is
something very private; I cannot reveal it to a non-sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU HAVE MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENT REMARKS ABOUT RELIGIONS, AND --
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOUR MOST RECENT ONE; YOU'LL CORRECT ME, I'M SURE YOU
WILL -- THAT THIS IS THE TRUE RELIGION, THIS IS THE TRUE CHURCH.
CORRECT?</p><p>A:* Right.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU WERE BUILDING AN ORCHESTRA OUT OF ALL
THESE OTHER RELIGIONS. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT?</p><p>A:* I have done it already. There is no question of proposition. You
can see my commune, Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists,
Jainas.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* SO YOU WEREN'T SPEAKING OF THE WHOLE WORLD, THEN, YOU WERE JUST
SPEAKING OF IN THE COMMUNE?</p><p>A:* I am just speaking of my world. Hell to the whole world!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU MADE A COMMENT A FEW YEARS BACK, I BELIEVE, THAT TWO THIRDS
OF THE WORLD POPULATION WOULD DIE OF AIDS. NOW RECENTLY ALL THE THINGS
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE NEWS, THAT THE FIGURES ARE JUST ASTRONOMICAL, DO
YOU FEEL THAT YOUR PREDICTION IS STARTING TO COME TRUE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No need because they are going to die; there is no way to save
them. Q:* HOW SOON DO YOU THINK?</p><p>A:* Within the last twenty years before the twenty-first century,
they are going to die either by nuclear weapons or by AIDS. The nuclear
weapons are the culmination of our whole past politics. AIDS is the
culmination of our whole religious past.</p><p>AIDS is the logical conclusion of all sexual perversions; and
religions have caused all kinds of perversions in man. Homosexuality is
a very religious</p><p>discipline. Monks were forced to live together in monasteries where
no woman was allowed to enter. There is a Catholic monastery in Athos,
one thousand years old. In these one thousand years not even a
six-month-old baby girl has entered the monastery. Even that is not
allowed. I sometimes wonder -- a six-month-old baby girl -- what is the
fear and what kind of monks are living inside? Are they monks or
monsters? And in Athos the rule is that once you enter the monastery
only your dead body comes out. You will never come out alive to have any
contact with other human beings. There are nunneries where only women
can live; no men can enter. Now what do you want? You are creating the
situation for homosexuality, lesbianism, masturbation and all kinds of
things. These monks, these nuns are the original sources of AIDS.</p><p>So your politics have brought you to the third world war, which is
looming on the horizon, and your religions have brought you to AIDS.
Your political and religious leaders have done great service to humanity
and to this planet.</p><p>I am certainly concerned about my people. They have been given all
the information about AIDS. Meanwhile, the governments are trying to
repress exact information for the simple reason that if they accept that
AIDS is spreading, if may create anarchy, chaos, turmoil. Rich people
can afford private doctors, private physicians, and they can keep their
mouths shut with their dollars. There are many people who have AIDS;
they are confirmed by the medical profession but the public does not
know about them.</p><p>Just think of the situation. A person who has AIDS can live at the
most two years, at the most, which is almost impossible. If he remains
secluded, avoids all kinds of infections, does not come in contact with
anybody, perhaps he may survive two years; otherwise, six months is
going to be the average. Just think, you are given six months to live.
You would not like to be condemned by people that you have AIDS. You
bribe the doctor. And you have only six months to live, naturally you
will make as many sexual contacts as possible. Life is fleeing out of
your hands. You would like to do everything that you always wanted to do
but you had time to postpone. Now there is no time to postpone, so these
people who are not made known to the public are going around spreading
AIDS like wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* SO YOU DON'T THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING ENOUGH TO
CONTROL AIDS, THEN?</p><p>A:* Not at all. They are doing nothing. Their senators have AIDS and
they have not yet imprisoned those senators. Their senators are
homosexuals; they should be immediately arrested. There is no other way:
put them into imprisonment.</p><p>Q:* WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH A SANNYASIN IF HE OR SHE HAD AIDS?</p><p>A:* There is no need because my sannyasins are living in a totally
different world. I have one million sannyasins around the world and I am
trying for them all to come and live in communes, not to live in the
outside world. So I am segregating them into different places, into
different countries, in communes. We do not condemn anything; every
sannyasin goes through the medical test and if he finds that he has AIDS
the whole commune is full of compassion for the person.</p><p>Q:* ARE YOU TESTING FOR AIDS, THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, we have our own medical center, all kinds of expertise:
doctors, nurses, a hospital. And we have a special place far away in the
mountains where we remove those people who have AIDS. We take care of
them. We give them everything they need, books to read, films to see,
games to play. They are respected in the commune, and everybody is
responsible that they are no longer to make any sexual contact. Not even
kissing, because AIDS is caught through kissing.</p><p>So I'm telling my sannyasins to change their patterns and drop the
idea of kissing which is certainly unhygienic even without AIDS. Two
persons mixing their saliva which contains all kinds of germs. And there
are idiots who are doing French kissing. I have suggested that my
sannyasins change that pattern: start rubbing noses with each other.
Hygienic, clean, and if sometimes somebody has a cold, at the most you
can catch cold. And this is not a big problem. Nobody considers a cold a
disease. If you don't take medicine it goes in seven days; if you take
medicine it goes in one week. And this is not something new; Eskimos
have been doing it for their whole history. They don't kiss, they rub
their noses and they enjoy rubbing their noses. As much as you want, you
can rub. There is no problem and I think Eskimos are far more
progressive, at lest about kissing. There are other aboriginal tribes
also, in India, where noses are rubbed and kissing is simply laughed
at.</p><p>When Christian missionaries reached those aboriginal tribes to spread
Christianity, the aboriginals have not stopped laughing yet about two
things. One they call the missionary posture, man on top of the woman,
which looked very ugly to the aboriginal. The woman is fragile,
delicate, she should be on top. And this huge animal is putting all his
weight and doing push-ups on the poor woman. In India this posture is
called missionary posture because they came to know about it for the
first time through Christian missionaries. Otherwise in India there are
known eighty-four different postures and in those eighty-four different
postures the Christian missionary posture is not included. And second
thing that they could not believe is that these people kiss. And these
people are trying to open hospitals, medicine -- can't they understand
what they are doing, that this is very unhygienic?</p><p>The aboriginals who are five thousand years behind the civilization
have never agreed for kissing. Even though they had become Christians --
they were poor and Christians could provide them with food, clothes,
education -- they have not started kissing. They still rub noses.</p><p>So, as far as my sannyasins are concerned, perhaps they will be the
only ones who can escape the calamity of AIDS. We don't condemn anybody;
if he has AIDS, so what? Take precautions. He is not humiliated and
disrespected for that; on the other hand, he becomes the center of the
love of the whole commune. Now we have two sannyasins who have confirmed
AIDS. We are taking care of them and we have given them the most
beautiful part of our land, the best beautiful view.</p><p>Q:* ARE THEY HERE IN THIS COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, they are here in this commune, but we have one hundred
twenty-six square miles, so they are miles away, beyond the lake, living
in a beautiful place and doing whatsoever they can do. They can do
proof-reading, they can do editing or whatever they want. They can
simply make a beautiful garden there. And if both those two sannyasins
want to make love to each other there is no problem. Nothing more can
happen to them; what has to happen has happened. Perhaps two persons
having AIDS making love may come to discover this is the only way to get
rid of the disease -- nobody knows. So we may be able to find out: if
they survive more than two years that means we have found what medical
science has failed to find. But we will be taking care of these people.
They are victims of religions, but what they can do?</p><p>If the politicians and the religious leaders -- that means nuclear
weapons and AIDS -- are in a race to destroy humanity, I don't think
politicians have guts enough to go for a third world war, because both
sides, America and the Soviet Union, have enough nuclear weapons to
destroy this planet seven hundred times. I don't think any politician in
America or any politician in Russia has guts enough -- and what is the
point?</p><p>The whole point in a war is to be victorious, but in this war nobody
is going to be left alive. The question of who was victorious and who
was defeated will remain unsettled and there will be no one to write the
history, either. Just because of the totality of war, war is an
impossibility. There is no need for pacifists, unnecessary to scream and
take protest march. Just forget all about it; nuclear weapons have
already done. They have finished the idea of war. Politicians can go on
talking about war because that keeps them in power, but there is going
to be no war.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN YOUR OPINION IF A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY GOT
HOLD OF A BOMB AND DETONATED IT AND STARTED ANOTHER WAR?</p><p>A:* NOBODY can start it because everybody knows that starting it is
finishing the whole humanity. And those poor countries who are dying.…
Do you think Ethiopia is going to have nuclear weapons? Do you think
India is going to have nuclear weapons? They are trying, but half of
their population is on the verge of becoming another Ethiopia. They are
selling their wheat. The people who have produced the wheat are dying
because they are hungry, and their wheat -- their production, their
labor -- is being exported so that India can manage to have a nuclear
plant. Sheer stupidity. But even if they can get, nobody can conceive
India becoming a nuclear power comparable to the Soviet Union or
America.</p><p>Q:* INDIA MAY NOT HAVE IT NOW AND IT MAY NOT BE A THREAT, BUT WHAT
ABOUT CUBA OR LIBYA OR KHADAFI?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* NOBODY. Even if they can afford, even if they can make, nobody
has guts to start seeing the whole perspective. The whole thing is clear
that if you start, that is not the end; soon you will be retaliated with
nuclear missiles and you will be destroyed. And your starting it will
mean the end of the world. So I don't think there is any possibility of
third world war. It is simply canceled. It is strange how things happen
in history -- war goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and a
point comes when it is to big, and you cannot manage to have it. War
itself commits suicide, that's what the third world war is.</p><p>Once Albert Einstein was asked, "Can you say something to us about
the third world war?" He said, "I have no idea. If you want to know
about the fourth world war I can say something." The inquirer was simply
at a loss. He could not believe what Einstein was saying. "About the
third world war you cannot say anything? What can you say about the
fourth world war?" And Einstein said, "It will never happen; that much
can be said about it. But about the third world war there is no way to
say anything."</p><p>So the war is certainly canceled -- nuclear war. Any other kinds of
war can go on. They are just football games, so I'm not concerned about
that. But AIDS is certainly my concern because it is spreading,
individual to individual.</p><p>No government control is possible. Even your president, your prime
ministers may be having it. Nobody knows unless everybody is checked.
You should begin with President Ronald Reagan -- that is the place to
start with -- the White House should be completely checked because this
White House is just like white lies. What is going on inside it is all
black. In Oregon catch hold of Governor Atiyeh and start checking from
there. First all your assembly members, your senators; first do it on
the highest level because these are the people who can keep it to
themselves and go on spreading. And then by and by come lower and lower,
and find out people, then these people have to be segregated
someplace.</p><p>It is such an urgency it cannot be delayed. And the whole humanity
has to be made aware of all the facts relating to AIDS, all precautions
that are possible. And around the world create the atmosphere that if
anybody has AIDS he is</p><p>simply a victim of centuries of stupid religious ideas. Don't be hard
on him. Help him so at least in these last days of his life, he can
relax. There is no need for him to be employed, no need for him to think
of other responsibilities. Free him from all responsibilities. Let him
enjoy music, movies, literature. Be compassionate to him.</p><p>I don't think your world is going to do it, but my communes are doing
it already.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* NOW YOU'VE MADE A POINT IN THE PAST THAT YOU HAVE A VERY OPEN
SEXUAL COMMUNE HERE. HOW DOES THAT EFFECT THE CHILDREN IN REGARDS TO
CHILDREN ON THE OUTSIDE? ARE THEY BEING EXPOSED TO SEX AT AN EARLIER
AGE? HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES?</p><p>A:* There is no problem at all. Children are told everything about
sex not in any roundabout way of explaining, but direct and exact. And
once their curiosity is satisfied they don't bother about it; they will
bother only when they are sexually mature. In the outside society they
become interested before their sexual maturity because they see in the
movies, they see in the streets, they see in their parents, and they
wonder what is going on.</p><p>A child is very curious to know about everything that he comes
access, and you create all kinds of curiosities. He knows his father is
reading magazines like PLAYBOY, and he also looks into the magazines
when the father is in the bathroom. He knows his mother is frittering
with somebody else. Children are very conscious, very alert, silent, but
watching everything that is going on around them. Naturally he becomes
curious -- something is being kept secret from him. -- and this
curiosity is dangerous; he may try to do something that others are
doing. It must be really great because everybody is doing it, every
movie, every family. All the children are talking about it, so there
must be something really experienceable.</p><p>But in my commune it is totally different. We tell our children
everything. We tell them they are allowed to ask all the question, that
there is nothing to hide, there is no secret. And we tell them that soon
they will become mature, soon they will be having sexual experiences, so
it is better to be acquainted with all the facts about sexuality as well
as all the fictions which are all untrue but have been told to children
down the ages. So we are making them aware of the facts and the
fictions. Then, when they are sexually mature, we do no not prevent them
from having sexual affairs. We simply introduce them to precautions;
that is their responsibility. If a girl becomes pregnant she becomes a
burden on the boy she loves and she becomes burdened by her own act, so
we provide to them all birth control methods. In every bathroom we have
free birth control methods available. They can go to the medical center
and get the pill. We help them in every way.</p><p>We don't want them to remain celibate because celibacy is cause of
AIDS. We want them to know as many girls, as many boys as possible. The
richer their experience the better for choosing a life partner later. If
a boy has known hundreds of girls he is more experienced and more
capable of finding the right girl with whom he can manage to live. There
will be less nagging, less fighting, less jealousy because the girl has
also experienced hundreds of boys before she decided for this boy. The
boy had experienced hundreds of girls before he decided for this girl.
They both know.</p><p>And in my commune it is absolutely allowed even after marriage that
if the girl wants to go with someone for a day or two, or the husband
wants to go with someone, it should be respected. It is their freedom.
Once in a while a little change is good, and it is not destructive of
marriage. On the contrary, it helps the people to remain together. Their
love becomes more and more a friendship. In the ordinary world people
are together but their love becomes more and more an intimate enmity.
Here, their togetherness becomes more and more a friendship, and any day
they want to change their partners that is their freedom, their choice.
So nobody is crying and weeping and screaming. If you hear anybody
screaming, crying, you should know that he is doing Dynamic Meditation;
it is not the ordinary screaming that goes on in every other household.
And we give them one hour every morning to scream as much as they can,
so for twenty-three hours there is no need. We are absolutely simple and
natural.</p><p>In the four years we have been here not a single child has been born.
People understand their responsibility. We are the only people in the
whole world who understand responsibility. Right now the world
population is four billion and it is increasing at the rate of one
billion per decade. By the end of this century there is not going to be
elbow room -- on both sides you will find somebody standing. What are
your governments doing and what are your churches doing? Four sannyasins
have certainly died in our commune but not a new child has been born.
And we are not going to give birth to children till the world population
is reduced to one fourth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ONE FOURTH OF WHAT IT IS TODAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* What it is today. Without coming to one fourth there will be
Ethiopias, there will be Indias, there will be small-scale wars. These
are just methods of nature to bring balance. Nuclear war is out of the
question; there will be diseases, AIDS and everything, just to cut the
population.</p><p>But my commune is perfectly responsible, happy, rejoicing. It is not
that anybody is controlling them; we only inform them that these are the
facts -- now they are intelligent enough to draw the conclusions. And my
communes certainly are intelligent enough. Almost everybody is a
graduate. Most of the people have masters degrees, a few have Ph.D.'s, a
few are D.Litt.'s. And they come from all professions: psychiatrists,
professors, doctors, engineers, electronic experts,</p><p>computer experts. We are absolutely self-sufficient. And that's what
we are doing around the world. We are trying to make every commune
self-sufficient.</p><p>If the outside world dies of AIDS or anything we can still survive
and we can manage humanity's heritage. The planet need not die with the
popes and with the presidents and the prime ministers. It can live, go
on living with dancing and celebrating sannyasins. But we are not
serious about anything. This, too, is not a serious affair. We do
everything playfully.</p><p>Q:* I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION TO ASK YOU. WHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY
FOR YOU? WHAT DO YOU DO FIRST IN THE MORNING? HOW DO YOU START YOUR
DAYS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* First, I'm an absolutely lazy man. I call myself the lazy man's
guide to enlightenment, so I am a non-doer. In the morning I have to be
awakened otherwise I'm not going to wake up. At six o'clock they wake my
up, and then I take one and a half hours in my bathroom relaxing in my
bath. I love my bathroom the best; it is my temple. They have made for
me really beautiful, gorgeous bathrooms. And not only one because I'm
always for two of everything, not less than that, because if something
goes wrong in one bathroom I'm not going to miss my bath. A second
bathroom has to be constantly alert and ready. So for one and a half
hours I enjoy in my bathroom. I have the best bubble baths. I'm allergic
to perfumes, so I can take only herbal bubble baths. If you come to my
bathroom you will be surprised to see what a treasure I have got there:
the world's best shampoos, hair conditioners, liquid soaps without
perfume, all kinds. It is really difficult every day for me to choose.
It takes my</p><p>almost five minutes to figure out what this combination will do.</p><p>After my one and a half hours I take one glass of juice; that is my
whole breakfast. And then I go for my morning talk, two and a half hours
gossiping with my sannyasins. I don't have any gospel I have only
gossips, and I laugh with them, enjoy with them. By eleven I'm back.
Eleven is my time for my lunch. and has been for my whole life. I have
never missed my lunch at eleven. At eleven-thirty I go to sleep. That,
too, I have never missed.</p><p>I have always slept from eleven till two for the simple reason that
if you sleep in the day for one or two hours, you have two mornings
instead of one. And why miss the other? And sleeping is just a beautiful
activity. Patanjali, the founder of yoga, has described the ultimate
state of consciousness as very similar to deep sleep. The only
difference is that in the ultimate state of consciousness -- what he
calls samadhi -- one is aware; in deep sleep one is not aware. For me
now there is no difference: my sleep is my samadhi. I am aware, so I am
enjoying my sleep in a double way. Patanjali, Buddha, Mahavira, all
those great Indian founders of religion missed something that I am
enjoying -- they missed the afternoon nap.</p><p>They could not sleep because all these so-called great prophets and
messiahs were fulfilling the expectations of mediocre people who were
their followers.</p><p>Now it doesn't look right for a Buddha to sleep in the day -- it
looks lazy, it looks luxurious. And Buddha had not guts enough to say to
those followers, that "If you cannot accept me as having an afternoon
nap, then just get lost. Just to fulfill your expectations, I am not
going to change myself."</p><p>Many times many people have told me that a religious man,
particularly in India, should wake up at three o'clock in the morning.
That is the traditional Indian spirituality, three o'clock in the
morning. I said, "I am ready to lose my enlightenment, my religiousness
and everything, but forget completely that I am going to wake up at
three o'clock in the morning. That is the best time to sleep; the most
precious time is between three and five -- those two hours are the
deepest. It is a scientific fact, but I have known it according to my
own experience that those two hours are the most important because you
go deeper. And I am fully conscious, so I can see when I go deep. Now
science has come to support it. They have found a way -- your
temperature falls down when you go deeper into sleep. Between three and
five, your temperature comes. down; otherwise for twenty-two hours it
remains the same, normal. For two hours, it suddenly falls down. So I
enjoy my afternoon sleep.</p><p>Then at two o'clock I have to be awakened again. I go for a drive
that I have always loved, and my sannyasins have made a beautiful road
just for me. Perhaps I am the poorest and the richest man in the world:
I don't possess anything, but everything that anybody can possess, I use
it. I don't think even the Queen of England has a private road going
into the forest in the hills by the side of a lake. It is used only for
one hour, and there is no traffic, so there is no question of following
any stupid laws of being on the right or being on the left. Mostly I
follow being in the middle, which is not allowed anywhere else in the
world. That's why I enjoy it.</p><p>Back at three o'clock, I rest just sitting in my chair. I have a
beautiful haiku from a Japanese poet which says: Sitting silently, doing
nothing, and the grass grows by itself. That's all -- haikus are very
small statements, but of tremendous meaning. So for one and a half
hours, I am just sitting silently, doing nothing, and let the grass grow
itself. And it is growing. My grass is not green, it is red. And it is
growing all around the world while I am simply sitting in my room, doing
nothing. Even Basho was not aware -- he was thinking only of the grass
by his side in the Zen garden where he was silently sitting. My grass is
growing all over the world and I am not doing anything for it. But one
and a half hours I enjoy sitting; then again for one and a half hours, I
am back in my bathroom for my evening shower. Then I have my supper, and
from the supper I come directly here for the interviews. By nine,
nine-fifteen, I will be back. Then my personal secretary has one or two
hours -- whatsoever she needs -- for any advice for the commune around
the world, any letters to be answered. Mostly, they do them themselves,
unless they find something that needs my advice; then they bring it to
me. At eleven in the night, all my life I have eaten a certain kind of
Indian sweet that I eat and go to bed. Without eating my sweet, I cannot
sleep.</p><p>Q:* WHAT KIND OF A SWEET IS IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It is a Bengali sweet which is not known in the West, but is the
best. It is made of milk but the butter is taken out. You heat the milk
and just pour lemon juice into the boiling milk. It separates, and what
is left is called *** (name of sweet).</p><p>It is something that the West has not used. It is the lightest sweet.
In Bengal it is given to patients or to those who are recovering from a
long sickness. It is very helpful and tremendously delicious. From
eleven to six, I am again knocked out. And it existence wants me again
tomorrow, I will be awakened; otherwise I am gone -- gone with the
wind.</p><p>My life is very simple -- the same. For thirty-five years it has been
the same. I never got bored by it for the simple reason that I never
compare two days. If you go on giving me the same food for a whole year,
I will not complain because I don't compare. Yesterday is gone,
finished. I again enjoy the same food with the same freshness, with the
same excitement, with the same enlightenment as I have always done. My
people go on doing everything for me. You see this beautiful robe? You
were impressed by the colors -- my people make my robes, my people make
my shoes, my people make my watches. Everything that I have on is made
by my people. That's why I say everything that I am wearing is priceless
because it is made of love. If somebody is going to give me a billion
dollars for this watch, I am not going to sell it. There is no price
which can purchase this watch because it has been made by my sannyasins
with so much love and so much care. And these are not diamonds -- and
that's why I loved it even more -- these are real stones, defeating
diamonds.</p><p>I have always enjoyed whenever a stone defeats a diamond, whenever a
genius comes out from the lower classes and defeats all the super-rich.
And it has been always so -- all the geniuses have come from lower
classes. The super-rich have been absolutely impotent; they have not
contributed to civilization in any way. They have not given birth to a
single Picasso, a single Dostoevski, a single Turgenev, Gorky, Marx,
Albert Einstein... they are just futile, getting fat.</p><p>In America there are half a million people suffering from over
eating, obesity; and this year exactly half a million people in the
third world are going to die of hunger. It is a strange world we have
created in which half a million people are dying because they have no
food, and the other half-million are dying because they are eating too
much. Their fridges are so full.</p><p>I have heard a story of a man whose wife was becoming bigger and
bigger, fatter and fatter and was looking so ugly that to go with her in
the society was just a shame. So he brought a beautiful picture of a
nude girl, well-proportioned, and put that picture inside the fridge,
where his wife was continuously going to give an idea what a woman
should be like. But the trouble changed: the man started going to the
fridge to look at the girl! The wife stopped; she hated to see that
girl.</p><p>She would have killed that girl. She stopped going to the fridge and
she started getting slimmer. But the husband started going to look at
the girl and while looking at the girl, he would get interested in the
ice cream and this and that. Soon the situation changed -- the wife was
slim and the husband was ashamed to go with her in the outside
society.</p><p>But this is what is happening around the world. A few people are
dying because they have too much; a few people are dying because they
have nothing. Just a little understanding, and we can create a beautiful
humanity and a beautiful world where nobody needs to die, where nobody
needs to suffer from AIDS. All that you have to do is to change stupid
ideas and make man a natural human being, and allow his humanity and
nature total freedom.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-24>The Last Testament, Vol 1

LAUGH?</p><p>A:* Just my presence is enough for them to laugh, rejoice, sing,

MADE YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK UP AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because the world is at a very great crisis. The politicians have
brought the world to the ultimate destruction of this beautiful planet.
It has to be stopped.</p><p>Q:* HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Just by spreading my red people around the earth; creating more
and more silence, peace, meditativeness; destroying people's old
programs of being American, Russian, Indian, Dutch, German; destroying
their old ideas of being Mohammedan, Christian, Jew, Hindu. Because this
whole earth is ours, all the boundary lines of nations should disappear.
Only then there is a guarantee there is not going to be a war in the
future. I am for one world, one government. if nations are there, then
war is inevitable.</p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, RECENTLY YOU MADE AN ATTACK ON THE CHURCHES AND ON
MOTHER TERESA CALLING HER A CRIMINAL AND BLAMING HER FOR THE POVERTY AND
THE ANGUISH IN THE THIRD WORLD. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS
GOD-GIVEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There is no God.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE IN, THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Their beliefs are blind; the very word belief means blind. If you
know, you know; you do not believe. You don't believe in the sun, in the
moon. You don't believe in the roses, in the trees. You believe in God.
You believe in heaven. You believe in hell. Those are all fictions.</p><p>Q:* ARE YOU A GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ... OR A MAN? YOU ARE A MAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am just an ordinary man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU ARE ENLIGHTENED.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That is not much of a difference. It is just a difference between
closed eyes and open eyes.</p><p>Q:* YOU BELIEVE IN POLYGAMY, BUT YOU ARE AFRAID OF OVER- POPULATION.
YOU BELIEVE IN FREE SEX, AND YOU ARE AFRAID OF AIDS. HOW CAN YOU
PROPAGATE POLYGAMY AND FREE SEX WITHOUT PROTECTING YOUR FOLLOWERS FROM
AIDS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am protecting them already; there is no question of how. First,
I am not in favor of polygamy as against monogamy. I am in favor of
dissolving the very institution of marriage. That is the ugliest
institution that has happened to man. Marriage dissolved, there is no
question of monogamy or polygamy. People are free: if they want to be
together, they are together; if they don't want to be together, that is
their decision. And children should be taken care of by the commune.
Children should not belong to families, but to the commune. And I am
taking perfect care of my people. In four years not a single child has
been born in this commune.</p><p>Q:* WE KNOW BHAGWAN, THAT YOU ARE LIVING A RATHER RICH LIFE. BUT DO
YOU THINK THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR THE POOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Those who are poor are themselves responsible for their poverty.
They have believed in idiotic religious ideologies which have made them
remain poor.</p><p>Q:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP THEM?</p><p>A:* They have to suffer whatsoever they have done. And if they have
to punish someone, they should punish the Pope, Mother Teresa,
Shankaracharya, Ayatollah Khomeini. Hang all of them: these are the
people who are against birth control, against the pill, against
abortion. These are the people who are increasing the population. The
Pope increases the population and I am responsible for it? And those
poor people listen to the Pope, not to me, so what I have to do with
them?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU THAT YOU ARE INSULTING MAYBE HALF THE
WORLD BY SAYING THIS?</p><p>A:* I want the world population to be reduced to one fourth. Only
then can this world be comfortable, luxurious; can people live, enjoy,
rejoice, create. Life can be a blessing. With this population it is a
nightmare, and the responsibility goes to your religious leaders. I am
not going to suffer for their crime. Neither me nor my people. We are
living in comfort, in luxury. And I believe in comfort and luxury. Man
has the intelligence to create more comfort than nature is capable of
giving, more luxury than nature has ever intended to offer. And man
should use the opportunity. These poor people who are dying in Ethiopia,
in India, or anywhere, have listened to the wrong people. Now they
should take revenge. They should burn the Vatican; they should take over
all the churches. I am not responsible for their poverty. For thirty
years I have been teaching birth control methods, abortion. And the poor
people whom I have been teaching these things have been throwing stones
at me, have been throwing shoes at me, have made attempts on my life.
Strange reward -- I am trying to show them how to prevent becoming more
and more poor, and they want to kill me. I am simply finished with all
that nonsense. They should go to their Pope, to their Khomeini, to
Shankaracharya and settle their things. i am concerned only with my red
people and with nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF YOUR MIND TO BECOME
A SANNYASINS? YOU ONCE SAID THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Certainly. There are two ways of being out of the mind. One is
falling below it; then you go into an insane asylum. The other is going
above it; then you</p><p>become enlightened. But both are out of mind. Hence there is a
certain similarity between the madman and the Buddha. A certain
similarity.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* AREN'T YOU FREEZING?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT IS COLD IN HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I love freezing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES ON.</p><p>A:* They are not thicker than yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, RECENTLY THE POPE OF ROME PAID A VISIT TO THE
NETHERLANDS. DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO COME THERE TO SEE HOW YOUR
FIVE THOUSAND DUTCH FRIENDS ARE DOING?</p><p>A:* No. I don't have any need to go anywhere. Q:* YOU LET THEM COME
TO YOU.</p><p>A:* They come here. Always the thirsty have to come to the well.</p><p>Q:* BUT YOU ONCE CALLED HOLLAND YOUR MOST ORANGE COUNTRY, SO I WONDER
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN OREGON?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* In Oregon I am doing something else. In Holland, even without me,
the country is going to turn red; but in America my presence is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING ATTACKS ON RONALD REAGAN SEVERAL
TIMES. I NEVER HEARD YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS.</p><p>A:* I simply don't know anything about the Russian leaders -- except
that I am against communism.</p><p>Q:* BUT YOU DO KNOW ABOUT AFGHANISTAN AND THE RUSSIANS BEING
THERE.</p><p>A:* Yes, I have heard about it. But I don't read any books, any
newspapers. I have dropped all rubbish. For five years I am just without
any contact with the outside world.</p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THEN?</p><p>A:* Just my secretary. Q:* SHE TELLS YOU?</p><p>A:* If she feels something has to be informed to me, she informs.</p><p>Q:* AND SHE DIDN'T INFORM YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN LEADERS DOING ALMOST
THE SAME BUT THEM IN ANOTHER ANGLE AS THE WESTERN LEADERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* She has never informed me about the Russian leaders. One thing I
know is that they are not hypocrites; they are openly dictatorial. They
believe in the dictatorship of the proletariat so whatsoever they do,
they do it without hiding themselves behind beautiful words. America
talks about democracy, but that is only talk.</p><p>Q:* WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS PLANET, BHAGWAN? WILL THERE
BE ANOTHER BHAGWAN?</p><p>A:* I don't know, and neither do I care. When I was not here the
world was not missing me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, YOUR SANNYASINS WILL MISS YOU WHEN YOU
ARE GONE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Only my sannyasins will miss me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* SO WILL THERE BE ANOTHER MASTER?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. Nobody can replace me; nobody can be my successor. I am
making it absolutely clear that we are not to create another
Christianity, another popedom, another Vatican. No. My sannyasins are
related to me: Drink as much as you can from my well, and when my life
disappears you are free to live the way you want. There is nobody going
to dominate you, order you, discipline you. I am against all discipline,
against all commandments. My whole emphasis is on the respect of the
individual and his freedom. Even if he wants to go to hell, nobody</p><p>should interfere. So when I am gone, you see only from one side: when
I die, you all have died to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WE HEARD THIS STORY OF THE REVEREND JIM JONES WHO ORDERED HIS
FOLLOWERS TO COMMIT SUICIDE. YOU ONCE SAID THAT WHEN YOU WILL GO, MANY
WILL FOLLOW. DO YOU MEAN THIS AS A MASS SUICIDE?</p><p>A:* I am not a Christian. I am not a Reverend Jim Jones.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU DON'T WANT YOUR DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW YOU WHEN YOU ARE
DEAD?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, never. I want them to live and live abundantly. And when I am
gone, I want them to celebrate my death because we celebrate everything:
defeat or victory, life or death. Celebrate, dance, enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IS THERE A LIFE AFTER LIFE? AFTER DEATH? A LIFE AFTER DEATH?</p><p>A:* Yes, there is. But unless you experience it, my answer will be
only a belief to you. I know it, but I don't want anybody to believe in
my knowledge. I can help my people to come to the point from where they
also can know. And that is one of my basic tenets: unless you know,
don't believe: doubt to the very end till you come to know. And when you
know, there is no need to believe. I don't believe in life after death
-- I know.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* DO YOU MIND WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DO BELIEVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I mind because their belief will prevent them from knowing. They
have moved in a wrong direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE, DO YOU?</p><p>A:* I want to take away all hope from people. Every hope. Because
hope is the opium that all the religions have been supplying to the
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT IS IT, THEN, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE WHEN THEY MAY NOT HAVE
HOPE?</p><p>A:* This moment is enough. Hope is for those who are unable to live
this moment, those who are suffering and are in misery. They need hope;
they only think of tomorrow. My people live today. And tomorrow never
comes, it always</p><p>comes as today. They know the secret of how to live today, so they
will be knowing the secret anywhere, anytime.</p><p>Ethiopia needs hope. India needs hope. Poor countries need hope.
Retarded people need hope. Miserable couples need hope that in heaven
everything will be perfectly good: your wife will not be nagging you
there. Your children will not become hippies there. They will not start
taking drugs and dropping out of the university there. You need hope. I
am giving to my people the reality; hope is only a fantasy. The sick man
needs hope for health. But why should the healthy man need hope for
health? He is already healthy.</p><p>Q:* IS THE MESSAGE YOU ARE BRINGING ONLY FOR SANNYASINS, ONLY FOR
500,000 OF YOUR DISCIPLES? OR DO YOU WANT TO BRING THIS MESSAGE TO MORE
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't want anything. My people are there. I have not searched
for them, they have come to me. Those who are in need, they should seek
me. If they are not in need -- get lost -- it is none of my concern.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU LIKE MY TIE? THIS WAS THE ONLY RED THING THAT I COULD
FIND?</p><p>A:* That is the only color I hate. I never use red. Q:* YOU MUST LOVE
SHEELA.</p><p>A:* Sheela I love, but not the red color.</p><p>Q:* SHE IS RED AND ALL YOUR DISCIPLES ARE RED.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That is why I have given red colors to them -- because that is
the only color I will never use.</p><p>Q:* SO NONE OF YOUR CARS IS RED, EITHER?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There are a few cars which are red, but I am sitting inside and I
don't see them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU ARE A VERY WISE MAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Of course. The wisest who has walked on this earth.</p><p>Q:* IS THIS CLIMATE FINE FOR YOU, BHAGWAN? MUCH BETTER THAN IN
INDIA?</p><p>A:* Much better in every way. The water is clean, pure. In India it
is difficult to find water which is not polluted. Just the other day I
was informed that in India half the crops are eaten by rats and other
animals. And the people, fifty percent of India's people, are almost
starving. Whatsoever they eat, half of it is eaten by bugs in their
stomach. So almost three fourths of their production goes to the animals
or to the bugs. All rivers are polluted. Here, we have the purest water
possible, the cleanest air possible. And we have enough land, space, 126
square miles. It is three times larger than New York City.</p><p>Q:* ARE YOU CREATING A WONDER HERE IN THE DESERT, BHAGWAN?</p><p>A:* Certainly. An oasis I am creating. And we have already succeeded
much. When we came four years ago, there was only one house -- that was
all. Now we have houses for five thousand people, fully equipped with
everything modern. All the houses are centrally air-conditioned. The air
is dry; that is what has helped me most. Because I suffer from asthma,
humidity is a trouble for me. And I suffer from all kinds of allergies
which are not curable. No allergy is curable; you have just to protect
yourself against it. So here we have managed everything. My people have
done everything so that for four years I had not suffered from any
allergy. My back was bad in India, and in India they could not manage to
do anything. Experts from England were called, the best expert. He also
could not figure it out. But strangely -- I have used all kinds of cars
available in the whole world -- just one car Silver Spur by Rolls Royce,
fits to my back.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IS THIS A COMMERCIAL, BHAGWAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am absolutely a business man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY NINETY. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE MORE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Three hundred sixty-five soon. Q:* EVERY DAY ANOTHER ONE?</p><p>A:* Yes.</p><p>Q:* AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM AWAY TO THE POOR PEOPLE, I
UNDERSTOOD.</p><p>A:* No. Never.</p><p>Q:* I KNOW, BUT CAN YOU GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE THEN MAYBE A BIT OF
UNDERSTANDING, A BIT OF LOVE?</p><p>A:* I have given them for thirty years and in return they have given
me poison, they have thrown knives at me. I am finished with all that
nonsense. These Rolls Royces will go to my sannyasins, not to anybody
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING IS LOVE. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE LOVE TO
PEOPLE THAT NEED IT?</p><p>A:* My people are enough. I have one million sannyasins. What do you
want of me? I am loving one million people. Do you want to kill me?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU WOULDN'T MIND.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Is it not enough? One million people? I am loving and loving as
much as nobody else can love.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE YOU A BETTER SHOWMAN THAN RONALD REAGAN IS?</p><p>A:* I am certainly better in everything. I believe in the best. And
if I start loving all those people, then what Ayatollah Khomeini is
going to do? Then Pope the Pollack will be out of employment. And what
Mother Teresa the Terrible is going to do? I take care of these people
also. I leave business for them also. I don't want them to die without
business. I have my business going fast like a wildfire; their
businesses are shrinking, so I leave the whole world to them: serve the
poor because your religion teaches that through service to the poor you
will reach to paradise. I don't believe in any paradise. I say: Live
richly herenow. This is paradise.</p><p>Q:* YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, YOU SAY, AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU
WILL NEVER HAVE VERY MANY DISCIPLES OR FOLLOWERS, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY
OF THE WORLD IS POOR.</p><p>A:* I don't want them. I have more than enough.</p><p>Q:* YOU DON'T WANT TO CONVERT ME, FOR EXAMPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No.</p><p>Q:* WHY NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't believe in conversion. To me conversion is interfering in
somebody's freedom. You can become a sannyasin; I will not convert you.
You will have to</p><p>ask. You will have to beg on your knees to be accepted. And then too
perhaps I may not accept.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* MAYBE I WON'T, BHAGWAN, HEARING ABOUT YOUR IDEAS. DO YOU RESPECT
THAT?</p><p>A:* That's great. I respect everybody and I respect everybody's
decision, individuality. Even if he is wrong, it is his right to be
wrong. But I will never try to convert anybody. In my whole life I have
never tried to convert anybody. The people who have come to me have come
on their own; if they stay with me, they stay on their own. If they want
to go, they receive a good farewell. They can go. It is all freedom: no
conversion, no enforcement, no conditioning. So I will not convert you,
but if you want to become a sannyasin.…</p><p>Q:* YOU WON'T LIKE MY COLOR IN RED...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I will put you all in red.</p><p>Q:* YOU WERE TALKING YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY CAN LOVE JESUS
CHRIST. I THINK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CATHOLICS CAN. AND WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THAT?</p><p>A:* How many contemporaries of Jesus loved him? Q:* TWELVE, AT
LEAST.</p><p>A:* Twelve. And how many were present when he was crucified? One, at
least, and the eleven had escaped -- and these are great apostles of
Jesus. And the one who has remained has refused that he knows Jesus.</p><p>You take few grapes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BE WITH THE LITTLE THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* You just take a few grapes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* INSTEAD OF SMOKING, BHAGWAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, they are very helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I MUST BE A LITTLE BIT IN LOVE WITH YOU, BECAUSE I DIDN'T SMOKE
ALL DAY. I DIDN'T DRINK. I HAD ALL MY CLOTHES DRY- CLEANED. AND I HAVE
COLD FEET. JUST TO SEE YOU AND TO HEAR YOU SAYING WHAT YOU WANT TO
SAY.</p><p>A:* I know you must be in love with me. And you can see in my eyes
and see my love for you. That's why I am saying take a few grapes.</p><p>Q:* SO YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BHAGWAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. I am going to take over the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU THINK THAT THERE IS LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS?</p><p>A:* At least fifty thousand planets have life.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* AND DOES THAT COME ONCE TOGETHER? ARE WE VISITING THEM? ARE THEY
VISITING US?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes. Life moves from one planet to another planet -- not bodies,
but spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFO'S? UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, YOU
KNOW.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. That's all nonsense.</p><p>Q:* PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLANETS VISITING US?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No.</p><p>Q:* INVADING MAYBE? IT COULD BE A TEACHER OF THEIRS, A MASTER OF THE
PLANETS.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Nobody is interested in invading this madhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT IS YOUR SEX APPEAL, BHAGWAN? YOU HAVE SO MANY GORGEOUS WOMEN
AROUND YOU AND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.</p><p>A:* I love women, and women love me. Q:* ARE YOU A CELIBATE?</p><p>A:* No. Why should I be? This is a strange question. Nobody asks: Do
you breath? Do you eat?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY SINCE YOU DON'T READ?</p><p>A:* With so many gorgeous women, you are asking me: How do you spend
your day? Read the book Arabian Nights and you will be reading my
autobiography.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHY DO YOU SPEAK UP NOW AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR THREE AND
A HALF YEARS? IS THIS BECAUSE THE FRUIT ON THE TREE IS RIPE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, that is one of the reasons. But even deeper than that, I had
gone into silence to let a few people drop out from sannyas. These were
the people who were enchanted with my words, my philosophy, my approach
towards the fundamental problems of life. I have been insisting that
what I say is not important: the important cannot be said; the truth is
inexpressible. You can know it in silence, but you cannot put it into
words. So I wanted to get rid of those people who cannot understand my
silence. The only way was to be silent. In three years I sorted out all
the wrong kinds of people. In three years those who remained as happy
with me as before -- these were my people. After sorting out the wrong
kind, now is the time for me to say what I really wanted to say. The
right opportunity was not there; now I have enough people who are ready
to listen to me without any prejudice. And I have not to fulfill any of
their expectations -- they don't have any expectations about me. So just
to sort out the wrong people was one of the most fundamental reasons.
Secondly, it is true -- in these three years of silence, the people who
were living with me have come to a state of maturity, centering,
grounding -- the fruit is ripe. The flowers have blossomed and now I
would like to spread the fragrance unaddressed. Whoever wants it can
have it; the fruits are here, just be the side on the table.</p><p>Q:* IT IS THERE, RIGHT, BUT NOT FOR A NEW GENERATION, BHAGWAN,
BECAUSE YOU ADVOCATE COMPLETE BIRTH CONTROL.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I don't care. Nobody cared about me. All of you are just
accidental products. Who cared for you? Do you think your father and
mother were thinking about you?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YES.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* NO. You are just accidental. Q:* THEY WANTED ME.</p><p>A:* No. Because they never knew who you are. They may have wanted a
child, but not you.</p><p>Q:* I HAVE THEIR CHARACTER, A COMBINATION OF THE TWO.</p><p>A:* There were millions of possibilities -- not only you. When your
father was making love to your mother, he released millions of germs and
one of them -- that is you -- reached to your mother's cell. All your
millions of brothers could not reach and died. And their life is only
two hours. If they don't reach the mother's egg within two hours, they
will die. And the problem is that only one can reach, and the moment one
reaches, the egg closes. It is rare that two male cells reach together
so there are twins. Once a cell has reached, all others have to die. In
every love affair millions of beings are being killed. And nobody knows
who is going to win the race. I don't think your mother or father knew
anything about who was going to win the race. It was fortunate that you
won it, but nobody cares.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THANK YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Come back again and again. I will be waiting here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME THAT THIS
INTERVIEW MIGHT NOT BE THE KIND YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO.</p><p>A:* No. I am never angry about anything. I am always ready to adjust
to anything, any situation. There is no problem in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BHAGWAN, IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND TO TALK VIA ME TO YOUR
DISCIPLES, THEN THE CAMERAMAN CAN MAKE SOME CUTAWAYS IN THE
MEANTIME.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Okay. I would like to say to you that you are a potential
sannyasin -- be careful.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU HAVE SO MUCH LOVE FOR ME?</p><p>A:* I can see it. I can feel it. I will be following you and I will
coming in your dreams. I am a little bit dangerous.</p><p>Q:* I AM NOT GOING TO WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, BHAGWAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, that I can manage. If you want to come here and you want not
to work seven days, you can work six days.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THEN FIRST YOU MUST HAVE A GOLF COURSE HERE, BECAUSE I LOVE
PLAYING GOLF.</p><p>A:* We are going to have it. Whatsoever you love, we will manage to
have it. Just come.</p><p>Q:* I CAN BE YOUR GREEN KEEPER.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Perhaps our golf course is waiting for you to come here. I want
my sannyasins to have everything that the world can provide.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* And they are having everything they need. Nobody has asked about
a golf course yet.</p><p>Q:* BUT THEY ALSO ARE THINKING OF PLAYING TENNIS, BHAGWAN.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes. They have tennis grounds ready. They have grounds ready for
football. And soon we will be having a golf course. We can have the best
golf course in the world.</p><p>Q:* I SAW THAT YOUR GRASS IS GREENER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It is going to be. It is my grass -- real authentic grass --
which every government is afraid. Okay? Good.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-25>The Last Testament, Vol 1

MUSIC EXPRESS, GERMANY, HOLLAND; O'KEG, SWEDEN; MUSIC MAN, AUSTRIA; FI,
ENGLAND; CONCRETE, MEXICO</p><p>Q: I'M WORKING FOR TWELVE DIFFERENT MAGAZINES IN EUROPE AND
AUSTRALIA. I ASKED EVERY SINGLE MAGAZINE TO SUBMIT ONE QUESTION, WHICH I
THEN RELAY TO YOU. SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WILL BE DIRECTLY FROM THE
MAGAZINES; ROUGHLY ONE-THIRD ARE MY OWN QUESTIONS. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
ARE VERY SIMPLE, SOME OF THEM WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL...</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will make the simple ones also controversial.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, REPORTED THAT THE
NUMBER OF RAJNEESHEES WORLDWIDE ARE DECLINING, AND THAT YOU'RE SLOWLY
RUNNING OUT OF RESOURCES. NOW AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SILENCE YOU HAVE
STARTED TALKING AGAIN, YOU STARTED GIVING INTERVIEWS, YOU STARTED TO
TALK WITH THE DISCIPLES. IS THIS PART OF A MEMBERSHIP DRIVE, OR IS IT
JUST YOUR WISH TO COMMUNICATE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In the first place, sannyasins are increasing all over the world,
so there is no question of their decrease. Secondly, I don't believe in
converting anybody. I believe that the very effort to convert somebody
is trespassing his freedom, his being.</p><p>I can say what I want to say, but there is no effort to convert
anybody to sannyas. In my whole life, I have never converted a single
person to sannyas. Although there are one million sannyasins around the
world, they have all come to me on their own accord. And I am against
all kinds of missionary work, conversion, making people Christians, or
Hindus or Mohammedans. Every individual has the right to be himself.</p><p>I can say to the person -- not as an authority, that I am the only
begotten son of God, so you have to believe me, and until you believe
me, you are lost. If you</p><p>believe in me, you are saved. These strategies are simply cunning,
political, playing on man's fear and greed. Exploiting man, taking
advantage of his innocence, ignorance.</p><p>I am against the whole company of messiahs, prophets, founders of
religions. A single man has declared war against all the religions of
the world. I am fighting with every argument that they have proposed for
thirty-five years continuously, and they have not been able to support
any of their dogma, and they have not been able to answer any of my
questions.</p><p>So the people who have come to me have come out of their own freedom,
intelligence. They could understand me, what I am saying, and they could
see the fallacy that I was showing them. But unless somebody comes to
me, asks for sannyas, I am in no way going to interfere into his
fundamental right of being himself. Right or wrong -- that does not
matter -- who am I to decide what is right for him, what is wrong for
him?</p><p>I can say how I have found my bliss, my joy. That's all. If your
heart starts feeling with me, if your heart starts beating with me, and
a desire for adventure arises in you for new spaces, new ecstasies, I am
available. Not as a leader, but only as a friend.</p><p>This is for the first time that one million people have gathered
around a man who claims no miracles, who claims no authority, who claims
no speciality -- who only claims that he is a friend. And if you enjoy
my friendship, you are welcome. The moment you feel that our paths now
separate, I give you my heartfelt blessings, the same way as I had given
to you when you had come to me.</p><p>Nobody is prevented from going. Nobody is pushed, manipulated to come
in. I have started speaking for my own reasons. I do everything
according to my own reasons. I never bother about the world around me,
and I don't care at all. For three years I was silent because I wanted
few people who were wrongly hanging around me because they were
intellectually convinced -- and that is not really to be with me -- I
wanted to get rid of those people. But I am not rude to anybody. I have
never said to anybody come in, I have never said to anybody to go out.
But I have my own devices.</p><p>Three and a half years of silence was enough for them, they could not
stand it. They were interested in words, they were interested in my
theories, they were interested in my arguments -- their approach was
intellectual. They dropped out. The moment I saw that the wrong people
had dropped, I have started speaking again. Now I am speaking to those
people who do not expect me even to speak. In three and a half year
silence they were with me with the same joy. If I was going to remain
silent forever, they were going to be with me with the same joy. Now it
is a question deeper than intellect. It is more close to a love affair.
You don't think about it -- suddenly you know you are in love, suddenly
your whole being starts feeling a dance, suddenly you start whistling,
you want to sing.</p><p>If something like this happens to anybody around me, then only he is
with me, my fellow traveler. So I have sorted out the people politely,
given them the opportunity to leave on their own accord so I need not
have to tell them to go away because they are with me for wrong
reasons.</p><p>Logic is a game. If two persons discuss something and one person wins
the discussion, that does not mean that what he is saying is truth. All
that it means is that he has more logical argumentative calibre than the
other one. The other one may be the truth. The defeated one may have the
truth, but is not articulate enough. So truth cannot be decided by
logic, argumentation. Its decision is something deeper -- it is of the
heart in the beginning, and in the end it is of the being itself.</p><p>So now I am speaking to my own people, and now I can open my whole
heart to them without even bothering to argue what I am saying. Without
giving any evidence, any proofs. They know me, that until it is
something that is going to help them, I am not going to say it. It is
not a question of right and wrong. It is a question of helping them on
the path.</p><p>So now I have my people around the world. They are increasing every
day, because I am the only alternative in the whole world against all
the religions and against all the politicians. Against all nations and
against all races -- I am the only alternative. I stand for the simple
human being -- I don't want him to be German, I don't want him to be
African, I don't want him to be American or Russian, I don't want him to
be Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist, Mohammedan. All these are
meaningless.</p><p>History is full of all this nonsense, and because of this, man has
stopped growing thousands of years before. I want man to be completely
clean of the past, so he can become available totally to the present and
to the future.</p><p>The numbers of sannyasins will be increasing every day faster and
faster. For two reasons: The politicians are creating the situations --
I am not converting anybody. The politicians are creating the situation
in which, if they succeed, this whole beautiful life on the earth will
be destroyed. And the politicians can disappear only if nations
disappear. War can disappear only if nations disappear. My people belong
to no nation. They claim the right of the whole earth.</p><p>The religious leaders, on the other hand, have led people to a very
dangerous disease: AIDS. Politicians have come to the nuclear weapons,
that is their logical end: and religious leaders have come to AIDS.</p><p>AIDS is a by-product of monasteries, nunneries and the preachers who
have been telling people to remain celibate. If you put people, man in
one place confined, women in another place confined, you are preparing
the ground for homosexuality. Nobody can be celibate, it is against
nature. It is against your physiology, against your biology, against
your chemistry. So just taking a vow of celibacy is not going to change
the whole program of your biochemistry. Then your biology will find some
roundabout way -- that's what perversion is.</p><p>And that homosexuality has ultimately culminated into this disease
AIDS which is going to take over the whole world like wildfire. Only my
communes will be the refuge, because only my communes, I am trying to
destroy all kinds of perversions and bringing people back to nature, to
their natural being, respecting their bodies, loving their bodies. And
trying to understand that sex is natural only with the opposite
pole.</p><p>A man and woman can only create authentic orgasm. All other ways of
orgasm are just phoney, and in the name of orgasm, nothing is achieved,
cannot be achieved.</p><p>Against nuclear weapons, I am the alternative because I am creating
meditative people, silent people, peaceful people who do not want to
destroy this earth. And against AIDS I am creating communes all over the
world like oases where people will be back into the garden of Eden from
where that idiot God pushed them out.</p><p>Q: IN ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS, YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER
THE WORLD. I THINK IT WAS A TV STATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.</p><p>A: I am taking over it. I am already on the way, but my ways of
taking over the world are not that (those) of Adolf Hitler or Alexander
the Great. Those idiots have failed so badly that no intelligent person
can try to take over the world in their way. I have my own way.</p><p>My way is to create more and more loving, peaceful, silent people
around the world. That's my; empire, but in my empire, everybody is an
emperor. Nobody is a slave.</p><p>I am taking over the world. There is no other way for humanity to
survive. Soon the people who are hostile to me will be begging that they
should be allowed in the commune, because in the outside society if it
is found they have AIDS, they are going to be condemned the way lepers
were condemned in the past. Lepers were not allowed to live in the
cities, they had to live outside. They could not move in the daylight,
they had to move in the night. They could not take water from the well
of the town -- they had a separate well outside the city. And leprosy is
not such a dangerous thing.</p><p>There has never been anything more dangerous than AIDS. So anybody
who has a little intelligence, then the politicians and the religious
leaders are pushing him to become a sannyasin. I don't need to go for
conversion. They are pushing people toward me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT WILL BE IN THE END THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: This is the only way -- not in the end -- right now, in the
beginning, because in the end. It is all finished.</p><p>Q: YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, HOWEVER, AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER.… A: No.</p><p>Q: WHAT ARE YOU, THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just a simple human being, just like you -- with a little
difference that your eyes are closed and my eyes are open. But you can
open your eyes any moment and the difference disappears. Or, I may close
my eyes.… Just that much difference, nothing much.</p><p>First I will try to open your eyes but if I feel that everybody wants
to sleep, then why I should bother? I should go to sleep myself! I don't
take anything seriously. Leaders are serious people, taking the
responsibility of the flock. And that's why I call them names, because I
cannot find worse condemnations for these people. Jesus I call crackpot,
a mental case, a man with a wish to die. And his whole life is a life of
a schizophrenic. The behavior is enough proof -- he curses a fig tree --
can you thing of why a man sane should curse a fig tree because there
are no figs on it? And it was not the season for figs! The poor fig
tree, what can she do? But he was angry because he had come from a
village where people had refused to give food to him and to his twelve
fools that he used to call apostles. And they were all hungry and tired,
and then they came to the fig tree and there were no fruits.</p><p>And this man talks about: Love your enemy. Even love your neighbor,
which is even more difficult than loving your enemy. I can love the
enemy very easily because there is so much distance between the enemy
and me, but to love the neighbor is just like loving your wife. .</p><p>This man is talking about love, this man is talking about compassion,
kindness and he is not compassionate to the poor fig tree. And anybody
cursing a tree, what do you think about him? If I call him a crackpot,
nothing is wrong in it. he was absolutely insane.</p><p>He interfered with people's ways of life. For example, in the temple
of Jerusalem where money changers have been doing that kind of business
for centuries, since the time of Moses when the temple was built. And in
fact those money changers were of tremendous help to the land and to the
people, because with all the donations that came to the temple, those
money changers were giving loans to poor people on a very nominal
interest. And Jesus goes and throws their tables and pushes them with a
whip out of the temple, and he says that this is my father's house and I
will not allow anybody to pollute it with money.</p><p>Now this man has no proof that he is the son of God. There are many
mad people around the world who think they are son of God, they are
prophet, they are messiahs, and they are all in mental asylums. They
also don't have any proof. What proof Jesus has? Any certificate from
God, any, message stamped by God,</p><p>signed by God? What proof he has got -- just a poor carpenter's son.
That too is not certain whether his father was his father.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU ARE BHAGWAN, YOU ARE THE ENLIGHTENED ONE. ARE YOU
PERFECT?</p><p>A: No. The Enlightened One simply means one who has come to know
himself. That's all.</p><p>The prophet dominates. He predicts. He gives you doctrines,
theologies. You have to believe in him -- he himself cannot prove
anything about hell or heaven or God, all are fictions -- but if all are
fictions, his being a prophet flops because then without those fictions,
how he can be the prophet? If there is no God, then how Jesus can claim
that I am the only begotten son of God?</p><p>So these prophets are trying to keep all the fictions, all the lies,
because amongst those lies they can declare themselves to be a prophet.
And the people who can believe in a God no one has ever seen, the people
who can believe in hell and heaven no one has come back to give us a
little detail about these places, are gullible. Any cunning person, a
little articulate can declare himself a prophet and these people will
believe him because believing is all that they know. And if he is the
type of Jesus, so angry that he throws single-handedly all the money
changers out of the temple and declares that it is my father's house and
I am going to clean it of all impurities, naturally the gullible will
see and believe in him.</p><p>I am not a prophet because I don't have any consolation for anybody,
and I don't have any hope for anybody. I don't sell opium to people, and
that is the basic function of a prophet -- he is a dope dealer.</p><p>The messiahs are trying to save the whole humanity. They have not
been able to save themselves. Now Jesus must have been a fanatic idiot.
Even on the cross he still believes that he is going to be saved by God,
but when he sees that time is passing, blood is oozing, he is thirsty,
he shouts at the sky.</p><p>The sky is empty, no answer comes. Never any answer has come from the
sky. Millions of people have been praying -- no prayer has been
answered. Jesus shouts, almost angry, frustrated, that: Have you
forsaken me? He is talking to God. He was still believing that God will
come sitting on a white cloud with angels playing on their harps singing
alleluja. Nobody came, nothing happened. People simply laughed at the
stupidity of the man -- even on the cross, he has not come back to
sanity.</p><p>And upon his crucifixion the whole Christianity is based. That's why
cross has become its symbol: I call it "crossianity." I don't call it
Christianity, it has nothing to do with Christ. Its whole thing is the
cross, and the cross is a symbol of death. So I don't say that Reverend
Jim Jones did anything which goes against Jesus. he simply followed him
to the very logical end. Jesus was saying to people: soon I will go and
prepare ground for you and soon you will all be coming, and you</p><p>will be with me and with God the Father in paradise. Reverend Jones,
of course, was an American and believed in speed and he knew that 2,000
years have passed and the "soon" is not finished yet. It seems a
different time scale exists in paradise, so he did not want to take any
chance -- he took all his followers with him. Why bother coming back and
then take them.</p><p>Reverend Jones is just part of the whole Christian attitude, but
strange it is that Christians started condemning that man.</p><p>Q: A LOT OF EX-SANNYASINS LEFT YOU DISAPPOINTED -- MAYBE IN THAT
PROCESS WHEN YOU DECIDED NOT TO TALK ANY MORE -- AND SOME FELT AND
VOICED THEIR CONCERN PUBLICLY THAT YOU EXPLOIT YOUR FOLLOWERS TO SUSTAIN
AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE. YOUR FORMER ITALIAN COOK, DEEKSHA, CALLED YOU
A LIAR IN THE OREGONIAN; YOUR FORMER BODY GUARD SHIVAMURTI SAID YOU ARE
DISHONEST -- I THINK IT WAS IN THE OREGONIAN, AS WELL. HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE PERSONALLY? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I love them still, the same as I have always loved them; and what
they are saying is not wrong. I have never said that I never lie. If a
lie is helpful, I am the first person to lie immediately.</p><p>Truth is not a value to me. Helping those people who have come to me
in every possible way -- and they are all asleep, they cannot understand
the language of the one who is awake.</p><p>So every enlightened person has lied and, of course, they did not
have the guts to say so. I don't have any problem in accepting the truth
that I lie. The whole question is: What helps to wake you up? For
example, if you are not waking up, I can lie and shout in your ears that
your house is on fire. It is not on fire, but what to do? Hearing that
your house is on fire you jump out of the bed and you wake up, and then
I can say I am sorry that I had to lie, but there was no other way to
wake you up.</p><p>Q: HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO WAKE SOMEBODY UP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: To the very end. I don't believe in half-hearted things. Anything
I can do will be total, so if Deeksha says that I lie, she is perfectly
right. There is nothing wrong in it. She is not condemning me.</p><p>Q: WELL, SHE TOLD THE OREGONIAN REPORTERS THAT SHE HAS TO HIDE FROM
YOUR FOLLOWERS NOW.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is up to her, and you have to ask her what she said, and why
she said. How can I answer for her? I can answer for myself. About
anything she has said</p><p>about me, I am ready to answer; but about anything else that she
says, she is answerable, I am not.</p><p>If Shiva says that I am dishonest, he is right. To me everything can
be used as a device to wake people who are fast asleep, unconscious. To
me it is just a game. If honesty helps, good; if it does not help,
dishonesty will do.</p><p>And I love those people who have left. The reason must be in
themselves. If they say they left disappointed, that means they have
some appointment with me? Certainly, unconsciously they must be hoping
that some expectations will be fulfilled by me, and I don't fulfill
anybody's expectations.</p><p>Those who can remain with me without any expectations, only they are
capable to understand me and capable to understand the work that I am
doing. These people, if they feel disappointed (it) simply means they
had come with a certain idea, hope, desire -- and I fulfill nobody's
desire. I teach desirelessness. I don't fulfill anybody's hope.</p><p>You must have seen the Christians have put a board outside my commune
that those who enter here, drop all your hopes forever. That's perfectly
true. They are doing my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO THEY KNOW THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They don't know -- this is the difficulty. That's why I call these
people idiots! So anybody who leaves me, leaves on his own
responsibility. Anybody who joins with me joins on his own
responsibility. So if you see these people, tell them that since I don't
take anybody's responsibility and I don't promise you any hope, then the
whole frustration is your own making. I am not a party to it.</p><p>I have never claimed that I am an honest person. I have never claimed
that I always speak the truth. Even under oath, you cannot manipulate me
to say anything that I don't want to say. I will say only the thing that
I want to say.</p><p>So all these allegations they think are allegations -- I don't think
so. By saying such things against me they are simply showing that for
its ten years or eleven years they were with me, they could not
understand a single word of mine. They are simply saying that they are
retarded, their minds are not more than thirteen years of age. Their
physical age may be anywhere, but their minds are stuck at the thirteen.
If they don't believe me they should go to a psychoanalist and let
themselves be examined that how much is their mental age.</p><p>With me only people who have tremendous intelligence can stay. I am
not Jesus. With Jesus all those twelve uneducated, illiterate fishermen,
farmers, woodcutters, carpenters -- those were his disciples, not a
single learned rabbi was convinced. That is very strange because he was
a Jew. he was fulfilling, long awaited prophecies of the Jews for a
messiah. In fact, they should have rejoiced that our days of waiting are
over and he has come.</p><p>But not a single educated person was converted by Jesus. He could
manage only with fishermen and woodcutter, uneducated, illiterate
people. It was a kind of</p><p>bribery and exploitation because he promised them: If you believe in
me I am going to take you to paradise. Naturally those fishermen,
woodcutters have never thought that they would ever be able to make --
rabbis, great scholars, saints, prophets, they will enter into paradise
-- and this guy is saying that if we just believe in him, we will be the
first to enter. So what is the problem, we are not losing anything. he
says simply believe in me, so we will believe.</p><p>But no intelligent person can do that. In my people you will find
just the opposite. My commune must be the only place in the whole world
with so much education -- almost everybody is a graduate from some
university. Most of them have masters degrees, few have PhD degrees, few
are D.Litts. They come from all professions -- they are not fishermen
and farmers.</p><p>They people who have left me -- for example, Deeksha; she is
illiterate, she would have fitted with Jesus perfectly well, but not
with me. She could not understand me. She was a good cook, but being a
good cook you don't become enlightened. Shiva -- what intelligence he
has got? If it took him ten years sitting by my side -- he was always
sitting by my side -- if it took him ten years to discover that I am a
dishonest man... then do you think I have to answer anything?</p><p>Q: LET ME GO INTO THE NEXT QUESTION, IF I MAY.</p><p>A: Go anywhere!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRIES DESPERATELY TO
DEPORT YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO
RAJNEESHPURAM IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I never think of tomorrow. I am here right now, and we are
enjoying! And for four years they have been trying desperately top
deport me. If in four years they could not find a single reason to
deport me, I don't think in forty years they are going to find it.</p><p>Four years is (are) enough against a single individual; and a whole
department is continuously working. Their people are going around the
world to find something so I can be deported. They will find that this
is the most difficult case that has come to them.</p><p>I am going to fight up to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Q: BUT YOU HAVE SAID DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO
THAT YOU WOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That was just to visit. And if I love it there, then the same
problem will be in Australia. Wherever I am the problem is going to be
the same, so I don't care</p><p>about it whether the INS in America is trying to deport me, or INS in
Australia trying to deport me. What difference does it make to me?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IT WOULD MAKE DIFFERENCE TO RAJNEESHPURAM, WOULDN'T IT?</p><p>A: Nobody can destroy Rajneeshpuram. If they succeed -- in the first
place they cannot succeed, because I have applied on five grounds. They
have only six ground. I can do the sixth, too. They have six grounds for
application. For five grounds I am capable. They cannot deny on any
grounds. Sixth is marriage -- I can do that, too. With as many women as
they want!</p><p>So it is just out of (the) question. They cannot deport me, they
simply will get crazy and cracks and retired, and I am going to be
here.</p><p>And if -- just for the argument's sake -- if I decide to go, they
cannot deport me, but if I decide to go, they cannot stop me, either.
Let them know it. They are absolutely impotent either way. If I decide
to go, they cannot prevent me. And If I go, that does not mean that the
commune will be in any way harmed or wounded.</p><p>I have prepared my people that without me they can exist as
beautifully as they are existing with me. Because I have not taken any
responsibility. You should see the point: I have not taken any
responsibility. I am not responsible for anything in the commune. I am
just a guest. I am not even a member of the commune, I am not a
sannyasin. I don't have any responsibility that they will miss me.</p><p>I don't do anything; in fact, they have to do everything for me. If I
am gone, they should really rejoice, and my being here is a constant
trouble for them. Once I am gone from here, nobody is going to bother
them.</p><p>And I have my communes all around the world -- without me they are
running exactly the same way, so there is no problem at all. INS or
American government, or any government cannot create any problem for me.
I can create thousand and one problems for them.</p><p>The moment I decide to create problems, they will be at a loss to
find how to tackle with me. Up to now, I have not created any
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT PROBLEMS WOULD YOU CREATE, FOR EXAMPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I can create any problem. For example, I can go to the Supreme
Court that the whole American government is functioning against (the)
American constitution. And I stand for (the) American constitution, and
the whole American government is against it. And I have grounds to fight
how they are exploiting and deceiving people.</p><p>The state government of Oregon is doing the same. They accepted this
city, incorporated it, everything was done according to the
constitution. For two years the city was legal. We were getting the
support of the state, the federal</p><p>government support to the city -- and after two years, suddenly the
city became illegal.</p><p>Then who is responsible? All those people who make this city legal
should be immediately arrested and imprisoned. The governor is part in
it. The attorney general is part in it. What these idiots were doing for
two years? They were giving state support, money, everything to the
city. What the federal government was doing? They were giving money to
the city.</p><p>And idiots can go in such a berserk way about everything, that I
don't think they have given much. (To Sheela, off mike:) How many
dollars from the federal government have we received?</p><p><br></p><p>SHEELA: ABOUT $32,000 LAST YEAR FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I THINK IT'S
ABOUT THAT MUCH.</p><p>Bhagwan: That is nothing. I cannot even purchase one-third of a Rolls
Royce. And these idiots are now asking the money back! In the first
place they did wrong. They gave that money to a city which was not
legal. They are responsible for it. In the second place, they have guts
to ask the money back. From whom? The city does not exist. You gave
money to a non-existent city, so go and ask the holy ghost if he knows
anything about it!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE PRINCE OF HANOVER WAS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SANNYASINS. HE WAS
VERY ILL, AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT YOU ASKED TO CUT THE OXYGEN TO
SHORTEN HIS SUFFERING. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TO DIE IN
INDIVIDUAL CASES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That rumor is absolutely wrong. Do you think if the rumor had any
evidence then the royal family of Germany would have remained silent?
And the father of the Prince, the mother of the Prince were present at
the funeral in India. The brother of the Prince was there, the wife of
the Prince was there, the daughter of the Prince was there.</p><p>If the rumor has any validity, then the Prince of Hanover, his
sannyas name was Vimalkirti. He was related to almost all the royalties
of Europe. Prince of Wales is his cousin-brother. His mother is Princess
of Greece. First she had married the Prince of Denmark, and then she
divorced him and married Vimalkirti's father. His mother's sister is a
queen -- perhaps in Spain or somewhere.</p><p>All these royalties against a poor man like me? Could not do anything
if the rumor had any evidence in it? Just their being silent is enough
proof that all this is nonsense. So as far as Vimalkirti's death is
concerned, the rumor is simply a rumor.</p><p>So please don't get confused about my idea, my approach about the
death of an individual. My way of life accepts that every individual has
the birthright to et</p><p>out of life if he wants. Death is not something that should be in the
control of government, law. It is an individual freedom.</p><p>If I don't want to live in this body anymore, nobody can prevent me.
And in fact, even though all the governments and all the legal systems
are against it, suicide goes on happening every day. And it is such a
amusing phenomenon, that if a person is caught redhanded committing
suicide, then he is sentenced to death. Because he was trying to commit
suicide! What kind if lawmakers we have? He was trying to commit
suicide, now you are making arrangements for his death. He should have
come in the first place to you -- that I am going to commit suicide,
please kill me. Why I should unnecessarily take the risk of falling from
a tree, getting broken legs, hanging myself from the ceiling, feeling
suffocated, but not dying, jumping into a river -- but because I know
swimming, getting out of it? Why should I, or anybody should take all
these difficulties.</p><p>So as far as philosophical opinion is concerned, I am for
individual's total freedom -- death included. And it is the duty of the
community to provide him beautiful facilities for death. Why one should
wait for old age and the troubles of old age, the degradation of old
age, the rejection of the young people, the old person feeling
constantly an unnecessary thing in the house, a burden to everybody? He
is not capable to do anything for them, and they have to do everything
for them. All his companions are dead, his friends are dead. He goes to
the same park where he used to go and sit with his friends -- now he
sits alone on the bench, nobody comes near him. Mostly he is sick in the
bed. And if that person wants then it is simply ludicrous just to wait
for death to come.</p><p>And this death is going to be terrible, because he will be old, sick
and he will die by and by, inch by inch, and we have now every
scientific way to send him joyously into deep sleep forever.</p><p>If you and your society cannot give a man a beautiful life, at least
you can arrange for him a beautiful death. And if he wants, it is his
birthright. And anyway, anyone who wants to go out of life will find the
way, so why unnecessarily create a legal system against? He will find a
way. The people who fail in committing suicide are really people who are
hesitant -- 50/50. In fact, they have a split mind. One part says it is
good to get out of life, another part shrinks back and feels afraid.
This inner conflict is the cause of their failure. Otherwise, I don't
see that there is any way to prevent me from dying. There are so many
million possibilities all around.</p><p>So you cannot prevent, and you think the penalty has to be an
electric chair? Why you could not provide that beautiful electric chair
before? The man would have said goodbye to his friends, enjoyed the best
meal that he always wanted to, but because of sickness and old age and
diabetes, he was not allowed. He can have beautiful ice cream, now there
is no problem. He is going to the electric chair, he can have champagne.
One day of absolute freedom because there is no tomorrow anymore. So he
need not worry about his blood sugar going high, his blood pressure
going high, or he is getting drunk and doing something stupid.</p><p>Who cares now? At least one day give him total freedom and let him
die. Help.… Your medical hospitals, all the hospitals in the world
should have a beautiful place for those who want to die.</p><p>He can be taught even on the last day how to be silent, how to relax,
so when you are given the injection which will take you deep and deep
into sleep, you don't fight it. Otherwise, you will be in suffering.
This can be simply explained. He can practice beforehand, do a little
rehearsal. And I am ready to provide to every hospital one of my
sannyasins to teach meditation. And his room for death should be a
temple, beautiful, with flowers and with everything. He should go from
this earth like a king. Just resting, relaxing and going forever into
deep sleep.</p><p>When we can manage it, I don't think we should prevent it. And,
anyway, it is going to help world population problem immensely because
1,000 people are dying every day in Ethiopia.</p><p>Out of hunger when one dies, it is real torture. Out of thirst one
dies, it is a torture of days together. Why not they should be given
injections which is simple, so they can relax and die and be reborn in
America? Because they all want, all over the world, the poor people
think America is the paradise on the earth. So if they died with the
idea of being born in America, great; let them die with the idea, and
let them be born there.</p><p>I am perfectly in favor of freedom, and death is only one part of my
whole idea of freedom.</p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Have I to spend it?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU SPEND IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I am asking you -- have I to spend it? I live it! Spending is
not a right word. Life is not money, you don't spend it. Otherwise, one
day you may go bankrupt. No, I live it and I live it intensely.</p><p>Each moment of my life is a blessing. Whatever I am doing, I do it to
the very climax. I don't believe in Gautam Buddha and his middle path.
Gautam Buddha was teaching the middle path, I teach the extreme. If you
are enjoying, what will be the middle path? 50/50? 50 percent enjoying,
50 percent in despair. When I am taking my bath, I enjoy it as much as I
have enjoyed my enlightenment, not in any way different.</p><p>And one and half hour in the morning, one and half hour in the
evening -- three hours I am in the bathroom. And it is tremendously
meditative, silent, beautiful just to lie down in the hot water and play
with bubbles. I don't play with anything else.</p><p>Q: HOW IMPORTANT IS SEX FOR YOU?</p><p>A: Not at all. Just fun.</p><p>Q: YOU SAY THAT RAJNEESHEE IS THE ONLY RELIGION WHO CAN REALLY FREE
THE PEOPLE. INDIAN OFFICIALS SAID TWO YEARS AGO ACCORDING TO SEVERAL
NEWSPAPERS HERE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES NOT RESEMBLE A RELIGION.
DOES THIS HURT YOU PERSONALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE ABOUT
THIS?</p><p>A: No. There is no problem. In fact, that is what I am saying -- that
my people don't resemble any people who have ever lived on the earth.
They don't resemble any old religion. Neither do we want to be
categorized with those insane theologies. It is a totally new
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID ONCE THAT YOUR RELIGION WILL DIE WITH YOU. WILL YOU NOT
ASK ANYBODY TO CONTINUE FOR YOU -- PERHAPS SHEELA, PERHAPS ANOTHER
PERSON, LAXMI, OR AN ORGANIZATION FOR YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nobody. It is up to them whatever they want to do when I am gone.
Do you see the politics in the whole idea of successors? That even when
I am gone I will control through Sheela the commune. Because I have
trained Sheela I can trust her, and she will remain in control. Then she
prepares somebody else. And in a subtle way, though I am dead, I am
controlling the living people. No, I cannot be so inhuman. While I am
here, rejoice with me. When I am gone, you are intelligent enough,
whatever you want to do, do. I am not going to declare anybody as my
successor, and I am not going to say to my people what you have to do
when I am gone.</p><p>Just look at it from the other side: People only see one side always
they ask me "When you are gone," but you don't ask me when I am gone,
you are gone as far as I am concerned. The world is dead. The moment I
am dead, for me the whole world is dead. Now who bothers about a dead
world? It is not one-sided death, that I am only dying. I am
disappearing to you, you are disappearing to me. It is equal, equal
death on both the sides. And I have no desire to control. I don't
control even while I am living. But these people, for example, John the
Baptist, baptizes Jesus, initiates him as his successor. This is a
subtle strategy. Then Jesus appoints these twelve apostles as his
messengers. And out of all that, by and by, the popes come in and for
2000 years, these people have been torturing.</p><p>The whole responsibility goes on Jesus, or even on John the Baptist.
There is no need. I was not in the world one day, and the world has been
here for millennia. Nobody asks me: "Bhagwan, what have You done when
You were not here for the world?" Nobody asks that question. It is as
relevant as the other question. One is about the past, when I was not
here; one is about the future when I will</p><p>not be here. But both are absolutely meaningless. I am here -- that
is the only place; and I am now, that is the only time. And I don't care
anything. I am not going to write a will that somebody should be my
successor.</p><p>There is no need. I give freedom, I don't give bondage like a
Catholic church. In Spain just a few days before, the government has
legalized abortion. Had to legalize because the population is destroying
the whole economy of the country. Reluctantly, they legalized abortion,
and now the church is fighting against it. And Spain is a fanatic
country. They are protesting and they are saying that anybody who goes
for abortion will be expelled from to Catholic religion.</p><p>These people can't see that who are you to dominate the whole world
and its troubles and miseries and sufferings? On the one hand you go on
saying we are here for your salvation, and whatever you do is just to
create more misery for people. I do not belong to this mafia gang of
popes, shankaracharyas, ayatollah Khomeini. I do not belong to these
people.</p><p>My approach is very simple: while I am here, I will sing my song, I
will have my dance, and when I am gone, I am gone.</p><p>Q: IN AN INTERVIEW WITH AN AMERICAN NEWSPAPER, YOUR FORMER RANCH
MANAGER BOB HARVEY, SAID THAT HE RESTORED SEVERAL MINES ON YOUR REQUEST
ON THE GROUNDS OF THE RANCH -- THE OUINNS* MINE, FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT IS IN
THESE MINES? AND IS IT CORRECT WHAT SANNYASIN DHYAN JOHN SAID THAT YOU;
HAVE BUILT A KALI TEMPLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is absolutely wrong. Because in those three and half years
while this man Bob Harvey was here, I was silent. I spoke only to
Sheela. I never instructed him. That's absolutely wrong; I was not
speaking. And it is true that there is a possibility of mines on the
land, it is 126 square miles of land. It comes in the range which
directly comes from Canada and moves through this property. Every
possibility -- it may have oil, it may have gold, it may have silver, it
may have copper; but we are not going to open those mines for the simple
reason that we love our people so much that we don't want any hazard for
our life. If you start working on a gold mine, you have to use chemicals
which finally pollute all your water -- poisonous. In fact, one ranch
just ahead of us has also gold mines. They were going to open them and
we had to go to the court because their water moves into our ranch. We
will not allow our water to be polluted, and we have stopped them.</p><p>So there is no question of our people digging up all the metals or
oil or whatsoever is available in the land. And legally ten feet of the
earth is ours, and unless we allow anybody to penetrate those ten feet,
nobody -- not even the American government -- can dig the gold
underneath. And we know how to be rich, how to be wealthy. Who cares
about the gold? Let it lie down.</p><p>And this man is absolutely lying that I had instructed. I have never
talked with him. He had no business with me; he was a servant. He used
to take care of this land before we came here. The past owners had put
him as a servant here, and we accepted him for a time being, so that we
can become acquainted with the whole territory. But that man cheated the
commune. he was getting one thousand dollars per month from his owners.
Our sannyasins are innocent people -- the accountant... he started going
to the accountant every week to get</p><p>$1000. Just a misunderstanding, the accountant thought perhaps he is
salaried</p><p>$1000 per week. Now, $4000 per month for a servant! Even a poor man
like me cannot afford. And what qualifications he had for $4000? Even a
vice-chancellor of a university does not get that much. The chief
justice of the supreme court in Oregon does not get that much. He had no
qualification, nothing -- just an ordinary servant. I had never given
him any instructions. And because we are not interested at all in the
mines, I don't think anybody else has given him instructions to find
out. Because we are not interested at all. So many people have
approached that they know there are mines here and they are researchers
and they would like to research. We have refused them point blank. We
don't want any research on our ground, because basically we don't want
to create mines here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SWAMI PREM LEELADHAR WAS INTRODUCED IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES AS A
PLASTIC SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZES IN SEX CHANGES. DO YOU PERFORM SEX
CHANGES ON THE RANCH HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: If somebody wants, it is part of their freedom. If somebody wants
to change his sex, I think there is nothing immoral in it. You have
lived as a man: you know what being a man is, and naturally every man is
curious about women. In fact, it is said that nobody has yet been able
to find the mystery of the woman. This is a perfectly good way -- change
your sex and be a woman, and find the mystery. There is no mystery.
(Laughter.)</p><p>But if you can live in one life both the sides of the coin, why not?
I don't see any problem in it. The sex change is such a simple thing.
The difference between men and women is so mall, almost negligible. It
is just like if you pull your pocket out it becomes man; you put the
pocket back, it becomes woman. And Leeladhar is really a great plastic
surgeon, one of the best. I only believe in the best. So if anybody
wants...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THERE ARE CONSISTENT RUMORS THAT THERE IS A HUGE ARMS CACHE IN
RAJNEESHPURAM. I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE BEFORE -- I
MEAN PEOPLE HUGGING EACH OTHER ON THE STREET, SMILING AT EACH OTHER,
WAVING AT EACH OTHER -- WHY WOULD YOU NEED SO MANY WEAPONS?</p><p>A: There are not so many weapons. We have a police force which is
part of Oregon state. And for the police force, all the weapons and
everything, the Oregon state is responsible, not we. We have a commune
security force because I have been attacked many times, attempts on my
life have been made, the last time in India when a knife was thrown at
me, there were 10,000 sannyasins present. It was in a morning discourse.
And because the police got some information ahead of time, 20 police
officers had reached almost few minutes before the man threw the knife.
So 20 police officers were eyewitnesses, 10,000 sannyasins were eye
witnesses, and yet the court freed that man without any punishment.
Because the politicians wanted him to be freed, because the religious
leaders wanted him to be freed. There is so much hostility in Oregon, it
is not a problem to me. In fact, I created it.</p><p>But my people are concerned about me, and if somebody comes to
assassinate me, I will not hinder him. That is his freedom, I will not
interfere with it, although he is interfering with my life, but even at
the risk of my life, I will not interfere into his freedom. But my
people -- why should I interfere in their freedom to protect me. So
those few guards are here. And what a strange thing that in a world
which has gone nuclear -- just those toy guns -- do you think we are
going to attack America or Soviet Union?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DECLARED DEATH AS THE BIGGEST ORGASM OF ALL TIMES ONCE. DO YOU
WANT TO LEAD YOUR DISCIPLES INTO THIS SUPER ORGASM, OR DO YOU FEAR
ANOTHER JONESTOWN AMONG THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. This is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen. it can
happen in the Vatican, it can happen in any Christian context. You
should be aware of few things:</p><p>Both the world wars happened in a Christian context. Christianity for
centuries has killed millions of people -- burned people alive -- it is
a death-oriented religion, in the service of death.</p><p>Poor Reverend Jones was simply doing the best he could. This is the
only place where Jonestown cannot happen, because there is nobody who is
a "reverend" here. As far as my idea about death is concerned, if a man
can go meditatively into death, then death is the greatest orgasm you
can feel. Because death is the separation of body and soul; it is just
like when the physicist breaks the atom, there is such a great
explosion. Just a single atom, which is not visible to the eyes, can
destroy Hiroshima, Nagasaki.</p><p>When man's body and his soul separate, if the man is alert and aware
in that moment, he will see a tremendous explosion of joy, light,
eternity, truth -- whatever you want to call it. But most people die
unconsciously. Before death, they become unconscious, so they never come
to know it. My people are learning meditation. There is no need for them
to be especially prepared for death. I am</p><p>preparing them for life, and in that very preparation, they are
getting ready for death. Any time they will have to die.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF I MIGHT INTERRUPT YOU, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT IF
SEPARATION BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE,
WOULDN'T IT BE DESIRABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT?</p><p>A: No. Because before that you have to learn how to be alert and
meditative; otherwise, you won't get anything, no orgasmic experience.
Because the experiencer will be in a coma. The whole life is a
preparation for death, and you should be able to be so conscious in life
that when you are making love, there are not only two persons, but four
persons. Two persons making love, and two consciousnesses watching,
witnessing. Or you are walking on the road, you have to walk with
watchfulness, alertness, so that you can see your own body walking.</p><p>The whole life you have to prepare; then only in death you may be
able to retain consciousness. So it is not just separating the body and
soul; otherwise everybody who is given electric chair will enjoy an
orgasm. Then Jesus being crucified would have enjoyed an orgasm. Then
all those Jews -- one million -- whom Hitler put into gas chambers. He
did really great religious work: gave one million people spiritual
orgasmic experiences, and still these Jews are against him. No, just
death won't do.</p><p>Between death and you there must be full consciousness. Then only it
can become an orgasmic experience. The whole life you need to prepare,
and then death is the climax of life. Then it is not the end of life,
but the climax of life. The whole perspective changes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SAID THAT EVERYBODY WHO WILL DIE IN A TWENTY-FOUR MILES RADIUS
OF RAJNEESHPURAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY ENLIGHTENED. WHY IS THAT SO?</p><p>A: That is true. Not everybody. There you are wrong. Only a
sannyasin. Not Oregonians.</p><p>Only a sannyasin dying within a twenty-five mile radius will become
enlightened. And this is not something new. It has been known in the
East for thousands of years. Gautam Buddha had said exactly the same. He
said within twelve cosas radius, any bikkhu that is his sannyasin dying
will become enlightened.</p><p>I was puzzled myself that how, what mechanism works? Twelve cosas are
approximately twenty-five miles; but then I saw few sannyasins dying
around me and becoming enlightened, their death was not death. I could
see it.</p><p>When Vimalkirti died, we celebrated his death as it is celebrated for
an enlightened man. You could have seen on his face the joy, the marks
of that orgasmic experience through which he had gone. He was still
radiant. The body was still somehow carrying the stamp of the
experience. And then, many sannyasins in these fifteen years have
died.</p><p>Then slowly, slowly I became aware why it happens. I am continuously
in contact with my people. They love me so immensely that it is not a
question of believing in me -- it is a simple unconditional love. So
whenever a sannyasin will be dying, these twenty-five miles are
something like an existential law, like the law of gravitation or the
law of water evaporating at 100 degrees. Nobody asks why.</p><p>And the scientist has no answer, he can say only that that's how it
is. Never at 99 degrees; never at 101 degrees. Exactly at 100 degrees
the water evaporates. But why the water has chosen 100 degrees? It is
simply a law.</p><p>These twenty-five miles, Buddha has recorded; these twenty-five
miles, Mahavira has recorded, another founder of a great religion,
Jainism, a contemporary of Buddha. And I have experienced it, and now I
can feel that the energy of a commune if it is a single enlightened
person, then the radius will be only five miles at the most. But if it
is a commune of thousands of sannyasins, the radius becomes twenty-five
miles. Why? Nothing can be said about it. That's how it happens.</p><p>And I don't know if the commune becomes bigger and still bigger,
perhaps the radius will become greater. I hope one day here you will see
100,000 sannyasins, and then I want to see how big the radius can be.
Can we cover the whole America? Our effort will be to cover the whole
world. We have communes all over the world which will soon have the same
effect. Just they need one enlightened person amongst them, and then all
other sannyasins become kind of radiating, reflecting the energy field
further and further away.</p><p>And when a sannyasin dies in this loving energy field, it is easier
for him to be awake than otherwise. It is just like if you are sitting
amongst a few people who are yawning and dozing, soon you will find
yourself yawning and dozing. And you will be surprized -- why you are
doing it? Those people are creating a certain vibe. If you sit with
people who are bored to death, soon you will feel a certain boredom
entering in you. You may have experienced sometimes to be with someone,
you feel as if you are nourished. And with someone else, you find as if
you have been sucked.</p><p>These are very simple experiences everybody knows that with a certain
person you gain energy, with a certain person you lose energy. People
avoid these people because they are parasites. The enlightened person
has an energy field of five miles, alone; but if he has a commune around
him, then at least twenty-five miles radius is ready to wake any
sannyasin dying within it. Why it works, there is no way to say. It is
just the same as other scientific laws -- it is also a scientific
law.</p><p>Q: YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT AND SECRETARY, SHEELA, HAS MADE TREMENDOUS
WAVES HERE AND IN AUSTRALIA RECENTLY ON TELEVISION AND PRESS INTERVIEWS
AND IN THOSE WAVES CREATED, YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY BAD PRESS -- THE
ORGANIZATION, YOU DID. DID SHEELA ACT UNDER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS OR DO YOU
FEEL SOMETIMES THAT SHE'S GONE MAYBE SOMETIMES TOO FAR?</p><p>A: No. She never goes as far as I want. She gets hit every time she
comes back home, that this is not enough. You say I, my people, my
commune got bad press. I want none of it. Because I know certain laws
that if we can create bad news immediately existence balances it with
good news.</p><p>In existence nothing can remain unbalanced -- soon the balance
settles. Now, to create good news is very difficult, almost impossible.
But to create bad news is very easy, very simple. And I know that the
simplest should be followed. Create bad news and let existence balance
it by good news. And you will see what I am saying; it has already
starting.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THEN IT WOULD BE EASY THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO
SIT DOWN, HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND TELL EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO HEAR
THAT THERE ARE HUMAN SACRIFICES ON THE RANCH, THERE ARE, WHATEVER HORROR
STORIES YOU CAN COOK UP.</p><p>A: We will do. We will do.</p><p>Q: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE ON THAT.</p><p>A: We will do. Everything. But we always wait for the right time to
do it. There is a saying that no news is good news. It is not complete;
it has waited for me to complete it. It says no news is good news. Its
other part is good news is no news. Bad news is the only news there is.
Create as much bad news as possible. Don't be worried.</p><p>Q: DO YOU CREATE THEN THE BAD NEWS TO WAKE UP YOUR DISCIPLES, OR DO
YOU CREATE THE BAD NEWS. ?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I create the bad news to wake up my disciples and also to wake up
those who are not my disciples, but will have to become my disciples
sooner or later -- sooner the better.</p><p>Sheela is doing good, but she can do better.</p><p>Q: QUOTED AS SAYING "WHEN THIS WILL BE ALL OVER, I WILL BUY MYSELF A
DARK SUIT, GO TO THE BAR, AND BUY A CIGAR." WILL YOU GO AND BUY YOURSELF
A DARK SUIT?</p><p>A: Someday.</p><p>Q: SOON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Soon -- just like Jesus said, "Soon." Q: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-26>The Last Testament, Vol 1

published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The
interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH KGO TV, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA QUESTION:* WHAT
WOULD YOU HAVE A REPORTER LEARN HERE?</p><p>A:* One thing and only one thing: that this is the alternative to
your world. Your world is on the verge of death. The politicians have
brought the nuclear weapons to create the funeral of the whole humanity.
And the religious leaders, insisting on celibacy, have brought humanity
to the ultimate disease -- AIDS.</p><p>And the politicians and the priests both are bent upon to destroy the
world. We are creating a totally new kind of man, with new values. And
these communes are around the world now -- one million sannyasins, and
we provide the alternative to your mad world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HOW IS THAT ACCOMPLISHED?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* First the sannyasins only requirement is to be a meditator. And
meditation means going into yourself, to the deepest core of your being,
where absolute silence, serenity, peace, bliss are experienced. And once
a person experiences those values then all ambitions about becoming a
president of a country, or the prime minister, or becoming famous, a
celebrity, all ambitions disappear. And if we can create millions of
people who have no ambitions, that is the only way to prevent war. War
is the culmination of ambitions.</p><p>And the peaceful man, the silent man who has touched his own source
of being, is no more Christian, no more Hindu, no more Mohammedan, no
more Buddhist, no more American, no more Russian, no more German, no
more Italian, he is simply a human being, and the whole earth is his
home.</p><p>If we can destroy those ugly lines on the map which divide humanity
-- there is no reason for war: one thing.</p><p>Second, if we can create such serenity and joy in people's lives all
their perversions; homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, group
sexuality, which all have culminated finally into AIDS, will disappear.
Because we are creating such a contented man who needs no one to fulfill
him. He is alone enough.</p><p>Q:* I SUSPECT THAT MANY OF THOSE WHOSE RELIGIONS YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU
DO ABOUT, WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH THOSE TENANTS, AND THOSE GOALS. OR
AT LEAST WOULD VOICE AN AGREEMENT WITH IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They would not. There is no question of suspicion. I am certain
they will not listen. They will fight back. They will be hostile towards
me. They are.</p><p>But that makes no difference. I am not a serious man. If the world is
going to go we will do whatever we can do, but our work is playfulness.
We are not saviors and we are not here to save anybody. That is just by
the way. Otherwise we are celebrants not saviors. We enjoy and we are
enjoying, and who cares for tomorrow? Today is so tremendously
beautiful.</p><p>Q:* I HEARD YOU BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THE WORLD IS ON THE VERGE OF
SELF DESTRUCTION ESSENTIALLY. AND THAT THERE IS AN ANSWER, THAT
SANNYASINS AROUND THE WORLD, CAN BRING THAT ABOUT. BUT NOW YOU TELL ME
HOWEVER, FORGET IT. BUT I THINK THERE'S PURPOSE HERE. THERE'S NOTHING IN
THIS PLACE SPEAKS OF ACCIDENT. EVERYTHING SPEAKS OF PURPOSE AND
INTENTION.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That's the beauty of being playful, and yet not becoming
accidental. Being nonserious, laughing, enjoying, dancing and yet doing
everything that is needs. There is no contradiction. That's why I say we
are creating a new man in which this contradiction melts, becomes
complimentary.</p><p>We are certain that those idiots are not going to hear. Still we will
make our best effort playfully. Knowingly that it is a hopeless task, we
will enjoy the challenge. There is no contradiction in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* MUCH THAT YOU DO, OR YOU CONSIDER PLAYFUL IS RECEIVED OTHERWISE.
AND THE CONFLICT WITH MANY AROUND YOU, WHICH I SUSPECT YOU RELISH, IS
RECEIVED OTHERWISE. WHERE IS THE MESSAGE IN THERE FOR THE OUTSIDE
WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No message for anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WELL, IF IT'S A PLAYFUL... IF IT'S A PLAYFUL ATTEMPT I MEAN.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Not even attempt, that's what I am saying, that our language is
different, that our way is different. We are not making any attempt, any
effort. We are simply enjoying the game.</p><p>The world is on the brink of death. We are celebrating our life. By
the way, if we can make those people also understand that there is an*
answer and life can be saved on the planet, good. If they don't hear, if
they are hostile that is their</p><p>problem. We are not concerned. We are living already and we don't
bother about future.</p><p>Our whole concern is the present -- here-now.</p><p>Q:* THIS PRESENT YOU ENJOY IN THIS PLACE CAME THROUGH PLANNING FOR
THE FUTURE THROUGH WHICH YOU ARRIVED AT THIS DAY, DID IT NOT? THAT'S
WHAT I MEAN BY EVERYWHERE I SEE PLANNING, INTENTION, CONCERN WITH
CREATING WHAT IT IS THAT YOU SEE TO CREATE.</p><p>A:* That is your way of seeing. For example, I am here. You think I
am serious answering you?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* NO, I DOUBT IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* But I will answer you, and anybody will be clear that there is a
purpose in the answer, that I am answering out of concern. No, I am
simply responding playfully -- just a game. You put the question, and I
respond with the answer. I don't care whether the answer received
anywhere any response or not. That is not my business. My business is
finished with the answer I have given. And I enjoyed answering it. My
basic purpose is to enjoy. I love talking.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IS THIS THE BEST GAME YOU'VE ...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* The best, because it needs the most intelligent people to play
it.… It is not football; it is headball. It is not football. Idiots can
do that. It is head ball.</p><p>Q:* IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU WERE A STUDENT IN YOUR EARLY YEARS,
THAT YOU WERE A BRILLIANT STUDENT, THAT YOU READ EVERYTHING ON THE
SUBJECT YOU STUDIED, AND THAT YOU HAD GREAT GRASP OF IT. WHAT DID YOU
STUDY? WAS IT ANOTHER GAME? WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU USED FOR
PREPARATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No preparation I have done for anything, ever.</p><p>I have loved reading from my very childhood. My own personal library
consisted of one hundred fifty thousand rare books of all the religions,
philosophies, poetry, literature. And I have read all of them, but with
no purpose; I enjoyed it. And the moment I felt that enough is enough.…
I have enjoyed the best geniuses of the world, and now there is no more.
I dropped. For five years I have not read a single book, not a single
magazine, not a newspaper. No reading at all.</p><p>The students may have felt that I am prepared. In fact, I would like
you to go with me a little more back. When I was a student, my
professors felt that I am more prepared than them -- and I was. But I
was not prepared.</p><p>They had stopped thirty years before when they left the university
and became professors. And I have read everything that has happened in
these thirty years. They were thirty years behind me. I was expelled
from many colleges for the simple reason that many of the professors
could not stand me. Understanding is out of the question, even they
could not stand me.</p><p>Finally I was admitted in a college with a condition that I will
never attend a class. But I ask the principal how I am going to enter
into the examination. Class is no problem, that is great freedom, good,
but how I am going to enter into the examination? The principle said,
that "That is my problem. I will give you enough attendance to enter
into examination. But it is a promise between you and me that you will
not come into the college at all."</p><p>And for two years I never entered that college, and I got into the
examination, and I got the gold medal, I topped the whole university and
the principal was amazed. He said, "This is simply miraculous."</p><p>I said, "There is nothing. I have never read your textbooks. I have
never listened to your lecturers, but I have such a love to read
everything, and to go to the very depth of, to the very roots of
everything.</p><p>In my reading there was no purpose, just joy. I relished it. For nine
years I have been a lecturer in the university after that. That too, was
a great joy. I relished, but the students were in a trouble. The
university was in a trouble, because I will teach Aristotle, and I will
also say that he is absolutely wrong. So first I will finish the course,
and then I will destroy the whole that I have been teaching them. And
they were in a great confusion then what is right.</p><p>I said, "Now, it is up to you. It is your intelligence to find out. I
have presented Aristotle with absolute sincerity, but I cannot say that
he is right. So I have to criticize him with the same sincerity. Now
both are present to you; you can choose or you can remain confused."</p><p>I was reported to the vice-chancellor many times. And I told the
vice-chancellor that, "Any day you want -- I have always carrying the
resignation, but I will do only the way I want to do, because it is not
a serious matter to me -- your service, your university, your textbooks,
your examinations, that is nothing to me. To me, teaching is a joy. I am
a born teacher."</p><p>Q:* YOU'VE WRITTEN THAT YOU WOULD TRICK A FOLLOWER OR A STUDENT. YOU
DON'T REFER TO THE SANNYASINS AS FOLLOWERS, ALTHOUGH THEIR FEET SEEM TO
BE FOLLOWING YOU.</p><p>A:* That is their problem.</p><p>Q:* BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD TRICK A STUDENT TO TEACH A LESSON, AND
THAT YOU HOPE THEY WOULD FORGIVE YOU THAT. IS THAT A TECHNIQUE THAT'S
USEFUL TO YOU?</p><p>A:* I have been simply enjoying everything that I have been doing.
And you can enjoy only anything if you are not serious about it. If you
become serious about it, enjoyment disappears, it becomes work, hard
work.</p><p>I have never worked, I'm a lazy man. I call myself a lazy man's guide
to enlightenment. I don't do anything.</p><p>Q:* SO THE ANSWER THEN IS THAT TRICKERY WOULD BE WORK?</p><p>A:* Just enjoyment. Everything that I have done or am doing, to me is
a joy. What it is to others, that is for them to decide. I have not
missed a single moment of my life without enjoying it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE ROLLS ROYCES OBVIOUSLY RAISE A LOT OF SILLY QUESTIONS...
BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS A LITTLE SILLY.</p><p>A:* It is not. It is not yet the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE BEHIND THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There is nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* JUST TO PRICK THE HIDE OF THOSE OF USE ON THE OUTSIDE AND GET
THEIR ATTENTION.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, because I am loved by my sannyasins. Whether I have ninety
Rolls Royces or not, will not make any difference to their love and
their trust. And I don't purchase those Rolls Royces. They are purchased
by sannyasins, and they are intending to bring three hundred sixty-five
Rolls Royces. So tell those people that the silliness is still not
absolute. It will be absolute soon. As far as I am concerned I possess
nothing. Everything that I have belongs to the commune. You will be
happy to know that from the shoes to my cap, everything is made by my
sannyasins themselves -- even my wrist watch.</p><p>They love me and they want to do something for me -- love always want
to do something -- and I don't hinder them. Why I should hinder them?
Those who hate me, they go on doing their things and I cannot hinder
them. I have been poisoned. I have been in every way put in a dangerous
situation. Stones have been thrown at me, shoes have been thrown at me,
knives have been thrown at me. Attempts on my life have been made. I
have not prevented anybody. And</p><p>why I should prevent my people who love me if they bring Rolls
Royces, diamond watches?</p><p>It is simply a balance between the hostility and love, and in
existence it is always balancing. I am just a witness, an outsider.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* A FORTUNATE ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Certainly, the blessed one -- that is the meaning of Bhagwan. The
word itself means the blessed one. And I am, and far more blessed than
any other -- Jesus or Moses or Buddha, because nobody had such a
worldwide family of friends and lovers and fellow travelers, none of
them.</p><p>Q:* WHY DO YOU SO POINTEDLY AVOID THE TITLE 'LEADER'?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because it is ugly, it is exploiting.It is putting somebody
down... suggesting that I know and you don't, so you follow me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT IS A FAIR ASSUMPTION THOUGH.</p><p>A:* That is their problem, you can ask them, you cannot ask me. As
far as I am concerned, I am nobody's leader, nobody's... any
responsibility I have taken on myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT IF A THING LOOKS LIKE AN ELEPHANT, WHY NOT CALL IT ONE?</p><p>A:* I cannot, because to me I have to insist my truth. If they are
insistent in not listening to it, I am more insistent and will make them
listen it. It is a competition between lovers. Nothing to be
worried.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE QUEST TO INFLUENCE THE HUMAN MIND MAY WELL BE THE CENTRAL
ISSUE OF THE NEXT DECADE OR SO -- FROM ALL FRONTS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT?
IF YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE, HOW DO YOU SEE THAT KIND OF COMPETITION FOR
BELIEFS?</p><p>A:* My approach is totally different. I want to destroy all belief
systems -- Catholic or communist, it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT ABOUT THE BELIEF SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN BELIEF
SYSTEMS?</p><p>A:* It is not a belief system. It cannot be a belief system. It
simply deprograms people, but does not program them. It leaves them
clean, tabula rasa, no writing on them, just the way they were born,
innocent. My function here is to</p><p>deprogram the Jew, the Hindu, the Mohammedan, whoever comes here. I
have to destroy his belief system. I am not trying to influence him in
favor of another belief system. I have none.</p><p>Q:* IT IS SAID THAT NATURE DETESTS A VACUUM, THAT SOMETHING WILL FILL
THE HUMAN MIND.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. That is not true, because for thirty-two years I have been
absolutely nothing. So it may be objectively true as far as science is
concerned, that nature abhors vacuum, but as far as spiritual interior
world is concerned, it is just the opposite.</p><p>The deeper you go, the more you find yourself empty. Ultimately, you
find yourself just a zero, and that is the point of enlightenment. Your
ego has disappeared,your greed has far away disappeared. You have
disappeared, there is only light, life, infinite, eternal, but you are
not there as a person, but just a pure consciousness, and it is
nothingness. Buddha has actually given it the name nothingness --
nirvana; that* means nothingness.</p><p>In the western world, no religion has reached to that point -- all
the western religions -- the three: Christian, Judaic tradition and
Mohammedanism, which are born out of India. The other three religions
which are born in India: Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism -- all three
have reached to the point where you enter into an inner zero. And that
is their ultimate goal: to be nothing, and it is never filled by
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF
THAT.</p><p>A:* You will not, and I am not surprised, because how can you
understand something that you never have experienced. For example, if
you have never tasted sugar, whatever I do, there is no way to explain
you the taste of it. I will have to ask my sannyasins to hold you and
force a spoonful of sugar into your mouth -- the only way. Looks a
little hard, but what can be done? Unless you taste it you will not
understand it. So if you really want to understand what I am saying
about inner nothingness come here, be here for few days. Meditate with
my people who have experienced it. Just being close with them, some kind
of synchronicity happens.</p><p>If there are a dozen people who are deep in meditation, you simply
sit in the middle of those people and try whatsoever they say, just sit
down and watch your thoughts and do nothing. But those twelve people are
radiating something towards you, and your effort together will give you
the taste. If I have given the taste to thousands of people, you cannot
be exceptional, nobody is. Everybody has the same spiritual
potential.</p><p>Q:* I AGREE WITH YOU.</p><p>A:* Okay, and you will remember your questions, otherwise your
questions will remain unanswered. Don't get involved with me, you just
remember your questions.</p><p>Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DON'T LISTEN TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* You just remember that you have brought questions. I have not
brought any answer, so whatsoever you ask I will answer. It is going to
be immediate, but to me it makes no difference what you ask.</p><p>Q:* I'M AWARE OF THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* But it is my concern to remind you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THERE ARE PATTERNS AND SIMILARITY BETWEEN WHAT IS TAUGHT HERE AND
HOW, AND WHAT'S TAUGHT IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW. AND SPECIFICALLY
IN THE MANNER WHICH INVOLVES RHETORIC AND PSYCHOLOGY. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
ASK YOU, "IS THIS PLACE ANOTHER JONESTOWN? IS THIS PLACE ANOTHER
WHATEVER?" BUT THEY ARE CLEAR SIMILARITIES, AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEWHERE SOME SHARED KNOWLEDGE.</p><p>A:* There are bound to be some similarities, because we are not the
only human beings. Outside also there are human beings, so there are
bound to be some similarities. I have two eyes, you have two eyes, but
that does not mean that our basic attitude is the same. For example, you
mentioned Reverend Jim Jonestown.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE THE SAME. I'M
OBSERVING THAT A LOT OF THE TECHNIQUES ARE.</p><p>A:* No. Neither our intentions are the same nor is there any
possibility of such a thing to happen here. Reverend Jim Jones and his
Jonestown can happen only in a Christian context.</p><p>Q:* HE WAS A MARXIST.</p><p>A:* Marxism is a Christian product.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* HE FORSOOK RELIGION AS HE DEFINED IT, AND I REMEMBER A SERMON HE
PREACHED ONE DAY WHERE HE THREW THE BIBLE ON THE FLOOR AND STOMPED UP
AND DOWN ON IT AND SAID, "THAT'S ALL</p><p>BULLSHIT," AND WENT ON TO TELL HIS FOLLOWERS IF THEY FOLLOWED HIM TO
GUYANA* THAT EVENTUALLY THEY COULD GO TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT
RELIGION WAS TO BE FORSAKEN. PERHAPS PHILOSOPHICALLY YOU COULD CONNECT
THE TWO, MARXISM AND CHRISTIANITY, BUT ON THE LEVEL THAT MOST PEOPLE
DEAL AND WILL UNDERSTAND, THEY AREN'T RELATED.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They are related.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT ISN'T IT MISLEADING TO REFER TO A MAN WHO DEFINES HIMSELF AS
A MARXIST AS BEING A CHRISTIAN?</p><p>A:* Certainly, because he still remains the Reverend Jim Jones.
Reverend is a Christian title... not a Marxist title. You don't refer
Reverend Joseph Stalin. And as far as Marxism is concerned, it is simply
a reaction to Christianity. Remember that Jesus and Marx both were Jews,
never forget that. And both were trying to change the Jewish tradition
-- Jesus in his own way, Marx in his own way. Because Jesus has failed
on certain points: the only begotten son of God, the existence of God,
heaven and hell, Marx simply denied. There is no God, there is no
question of any begotten son of God, there is no heaven and hell. In
fact, there is no consciousness in man, it is only a by-product of
material things.</p><p>It was really Jesus in a new edition in which all those points have
been deleted which brought Jesus to the crucifixion -- only those points
are. Otherwise, just as Jesus is concerned with the poor and says,
"Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of God," Marx is not
different. He says, "Proletariat of the world unite, because you have
nothing to lose and everything to gain." The only difference is that
Jesus was talking about a fictitious kingdom far away in the heavens,
and Marx was a more pragmatic and practical man -- he was talking that,
"We can create that paradise here -- all that is needed is: destroy
classes, make a classless society." But both were in favor of the poor,
both were against the rich.</p><p>Jesus says, "A camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but not a
rich man can pass through the gates of his god." Now this man seems to
be the first communist! What do you expect of a communist? Even Marx has
not such a strong statement against the rich. In fact he was living on
the money provided by a rich man, Friedrich Engels; whole life he never
earned anything. Friedrich Engels was an industrialist, a rich man, and
he supplied all his needs, his whole life.</p><p>He could not say that Engels cannot enter into the kingdom of God;
without Engels, Marx himself will not find a way into kingdom of
God.</p><p>Jesus raises the poor to the highest level. He praises them and
that's what Marx was doing in a more scientific way. Jesus was too
young. He was crucified when he was thirty-three, uneducated, knowing
nothing -- he was just a carpenter's son. Maybe he knew something about
wood, but about God he knew nothing.</p><p>Karl Marx is just another Jew, against the Jewish tradition, the
richness of the Jews, their immense intelligence to create wealth --
Marx was poor, just as Jesus was poor. And you must remember that Marx's
father was a reverend, so he was brought up in the context of
Christianity. His father was converted -- he was a Christian -- and he
was teaching Christianity to his children too. And whole communism is
just a reaction against the Jewish wealth, their capacity to create
wealth.</p><p>This man, Reverent Jim Jones, is doing exactly what Jesus was doing.
He was saying to people that, "You just follow me, believe in me, and
you will enter into my kingdom of God." The only condition was, "Believe
in me!" And that was the condition of Reverend Jones, "Believe in me,
and I will lead you to the kingdom of God." His kingdom of God may have
been Sovietland -- that does not matter -- but he was the leader and you
were the led; he knew what and where they are going -- you need not
bother about it, need not even question about it.</p><p>Secondly, Jesus said to his disciples, "I will come back. First I
will prepare the ground for you in the kingdom of God and then I will
come back to take you." Reverend Jim Jones were far more intelligent
than Jesus: why go and prepare; why not take the whole lot with you?</p><p>This is the only place where Jonestown cannot happen. It can happen
anywhere within Christian context; it cannot happen in India, you cannot
conceive. In Hindu concept you cannot conceive.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* OF WHAT? -- SUICIDE. THOUGH NOT ALL WHAT HAPPENS THERE WAS
SUICIDE.</p><p>A:* Jonestown -- Jonestown you cannot conceive under Hindu or
Buddhist or Jaina or Tao traditions -- impossible, for the simple reason
that Krishna, who is the God of the Hindus is a lover of life. He has
sixteen thousand wives. Do you think such a man will...?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* COMMIT SUICIDE? YES, FRANKLY.</p><p>A:* No! Suicide is committed by people who have only one wife. Having
sixteen thousand wives, one is already living in paradise! What more you
can want?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I USED THE JONESTOWN THING JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF, OF THE ISSUE OF
THE SIMILARITIES TO WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN.…</p><p>A:* There are no similarities.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I DON'T SEEK TO DRAW A CONCLUSION OF A SIMILAR END. WHAT</p><p>I'VE SEEN IS REMARKABLE SIMILARITY IN TECHNIQUE.</p><p>A:* Just tell me what.</p><p>Q:* IN THE TECHNIQUE OF ATTRACTING, WORKING WITH PEOPLE.</p><p>A:* What technique?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION -- NOT PRECISELY THE SAME (TAPE
INAUDIBLE)</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Reverend Jim Jones.… Or even Jesus, has never heard what
meditation is. They knew only prayer and prayer is not meditation.</p><p>You are finding difficulty now to... show the similarities.
Meditation you mentioned, which cannot exist in Jonestown.</p><p>Q:* THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. There is no control.</p><p>There is no control about anything. People are absolutely free to be
here or not to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>I DON'T SEEK A TRICK HERE AND I DON'T SEEK A FALSE COMPARISON,
SO.…</p><p>A:* No. I understand. I understand your intention. Just see one
thing: in Jonestown, the major following was Black people, in this place
the major following is White people. In Jonestown the people were all
illiterate, uneducated... except for few. Here everybody is educated,
most of them are graduates of universities, most of them has Masters'
degrees, few have Ph.D.'s, few are D.Litt's. Not even few are
uneducated. The uneducated, the illiterate, the poor, the Black -- these
are the people who are very gullible, these are the people who are
victims of all kinds of systems of belief.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* A STREET BLACK WOULD TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NONSENSE, THAT HE'S
HARD TO CON, SO WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They were just here for three month, to share homes with us. They
were not going to be part of the commune and we were not interested in
transforming them. Just whenever we have surplus money, and our people
are so productive all around the world, that whenever we have some
surplus money, we would like to share it with different groups. That was
just the our first experiment to share it with the street people and to
give them the same dignity as any other human being needs: give them the
same love, the same equality, the same</p><p>clothes, the same food, the same air-conditioned housing -- a taste
of what they are missing on the streets.</p><p>Never again we are going to invite them, because we have other
projects, far more dangerous. In the next month we are going to have
another project which is going to shake the whole America.</p><p>Q:* I TAKE IT FROM THE FACT YOU DIDN'T VOLUNTEER TO TELL ME WHAT IS,
THERE'S NO POINT IN ASKING.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There is no point in asking, because I would like to keep people
in curiosity, suspense.</p><p>Q:* A SANNYASIN ONCE TOLD ME DURING THE PERIOD OF YOUR SILENCE THAT
YOU WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN AN ECONOMIC NEED AROSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That's wrong. We have never faced any economic need, otherwise my
Rolls Royces will not be go on growing. One has come just now, one is
coming within the next week, and one I am informed, my people are
specially making: an old model of Rolls Royce, Phantom.</p><p>It is going to cost four-hundred-thousand dollars. Ordinary Rolls
Royce costs only one hundred thousand dollars; it will take one and half
year to be made, but it will be the most unique Rolls Royce in the whole
world. So we are not out of economy. There is no question, for me to
speak because my commune was not going well.</p><p>My commune is going so well that nothing else in the whole world is
going so well! Five thousand people are here. They all have the best
standard of food, the best housing, the whole commune is centrally
air-conditioned, they have hundreds of cars, hundreds of busses, they
have five planes, and we are not expanding, because the legality of the
city is under litigation, so they have prevented us to expand. Otherwise
I was going to bring one hundred thousand sannyasins here and I will
bring. The litigation we are going to win.</p><p>In a democratic country nobody can defeat me.</p><p>Q:* WHERE COULD A MAN LIKE YOU BE DEFEATED?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Only in the Soviet Union, never, no other place. They are afraid
in Soviet Union. Already my books are banned. I have sannyasins
underground in Soviet Union, they are being persecuted, already, but
because of the government persecution, there is great excitement to
become sannyasins. For the first time, against communism, there is a new
movement. And the new generation needs something new. Communism is
already out of date. Marx's books, who reads? No communist, nobody
bothers -- it is just old testament. So that is the only place</p><p>where I may be defeated, but not in America. If I am defeated in
America then America is not different from Soviet Union; then it is a
bogus democracy, hypocrite.</p><p>Q:* DO YOU SAY THAT IN CONFIDENCE OF YOUR BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME
OF DEMOCRACY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:*... SO THAT IF YOU CAN'T WIN THEN THE GAME IS WRONG?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I know the constitution of America and I am going to stand for it
against the Americans, because the American government, the state
governments are all violating the basic rights given to human beings in
the constitution.</p><p>I can play the game. I can play the game in Soviet Union also, if the
need arises, because I don't think anybody has read communist literature
more than I have read. I can play the game, but first I have to try
America.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND
PSYCHIATRY HERE?</p><p>A:* This reason is clear: psychology is the latest development of
intelligence, the latest science. And they can understand me more than
anybody else. They are the most intelligent people.</p><p>Q:* CAN THEY TEACH BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That is not certain. To be a psychologist is one thing; to be a
teacher is totally different art.</p><p>We have so many psychologists here that many Ph.D.'s are farming,
many Ph.D.'s are creating dams, many Ph.D.'s are looking after my
peacocks. Few</p><p>perhaps are functioning as psychologists, psychiatrists, in the
medical center. If somebody needs any help, if somebody is
schizophrenic.…</p><p>Q:* WHAT ABOUT IN THE MEDITATION COURSES AND IN THE UNIVERSITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Meditation is beyond psychology. It is not psychology. It has
nothing to do with brain, it has nothing to do with the mind either. It
is a state of no-mind. Even Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and
Alfred Adler, had no idea of meditation, what it is. They all thought in
terms of concentration. Concentration has nothing to do with meditation.
Concentration is a method of the mind and meditation is a way how to
transcend the mind, how to go above the mind -- so</p><p>you are on the top of the hills and all your thoughts are just in the
valley -- and you can watch them and you can have a bird's eye view of
what kind of mind you have.</p><p>These are three things: the state of no-mind which is your being, the
mind which is what the society has conditioned you for, the third -- the
brain -- which you have brought into the world with the body. The most
bogus is the mind. The brain is a reality. The no-mind is a reality. The
mind is only a program: Hindu mind, Mohammedan mind, communist mind --
the mind has to be labeled, because it is a program. And meditation is a
deprogramming. It is going beyond the mind. Nobody can deprogram a
meditation man -- impossible. There is no way. He has nothing.</p><p>I am available: I give the challenge to any psychiatrist in the whole
world if he can deprogram me. Just he has to be alerted that by
deprogramming me, he may get deprogrammed!</p><p>Q:* I SEE THIS BUSINESS OF COMPETITION FOR THE THOUGHTS OF MAN AND
FOR THE INDOCTRINATION PROCEDURES THAT ARE GOING ON ALL OVER THE WORLD.
IT HAPPENS IN ADVERTISING, IT HAPPENS IN THE MILITARY, IT HAPPENS IN
CHURCHES, BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED.… THERE SEEMS
TO BE A LEVEL OF IT THAT'S ALMOST FRANCHISABLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. No indoctrination happens here -- sophisticated or
unsophisticated -- because if you look at my books you will find
thousands of contradictions in them. Talking to me is just a beautiful
game, with words. I am not trying to preach a certain doctrine,
otherwise I will be consistent. I will repeat the same thing.</p><p>I have never repeated anything. And I have contradicted myself every
day and I tell to my people never bring yesterday what I said. You ask
directly right now whatever is your question, but don't bring that,
"Bhagwan, you said ten years before this and now you are saying this.…"
I have never read my books, and I don't remember ten years back. And why
should I remember unnecessary luggage on my head?</p><p>I am available, more alert, more aware, than I was ten years before.
Q:* DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD?</p><p>A:* No. That indoctrination is going on all over the place, except my
communes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT LEADING, YOUR COMMUNE QUITE ASIDE, JUST AS
AN OBSERVATION?</p><p>A:* Everywhere. The pope is doing, Mother Teresa the terrible is
doing. That</p><p>woman is terrible!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THIS RULED MY QUEST: TO MAKE FOLKS SEE THINGS HOW WHATEVER
PARTICULAR LEADER SEES THEM. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE HEATING UP AND
HEADING SOME PLACE THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD AT
LARGE.</p><p>A:* It is happening there and the politicians are leading the world
to a nuclear war, because they go on piling up nuclear weapons inspite
of all their speeches about peace, love, friendship, coexistence -- but
they all are piling up nuclear weapons.</p><p>In fact it seems to be a little crazy: already they have so much
nuclear weapons, they can destroy this planet for seven hundred times.
Now there is no need. There is no way for life to escape; they have
already seven hundred times more than it is needed. But they are heading
out of fear of each other.</p><p>The religious leaders are continuously trying to convert,
particularly Christianity which is the biggest religion in the world, is
trying to convert the poor people very easily. Because those poor people
need food, those people need medicine, they need houses, they need jobs,
and Christianity can provide them few things. And their own religion
cannot do anything else but prayer to a God who does not exist.</p><p>So Christianity is trying to convert people more and more into the
church, because it is also a political game -- politics of numbers.</p><p>Politicians and priests have been in a certain conspiracy always. The
conspiracy is that they both need wars, they both need poverty, they
both need people in suffering, misery, orphans, widows, sick people --
they both need all these people. Without these people Adolf Hitler has a
statement in his biography that, "Only in a wartime you can become a
great hero," and that is true: all your heroes are wartime heroes. You
don't know anything about, not a single peacetime hero. Politicians, if
they want to achieve their ambition -- and they are ambitious people,
otherwise why they should be in politics? Their ambition can be
fulfilled only in war. The trouble is that the third world war is going
to destroy all, so both parties are waiting and trying to find out ways
how to prevent nuclear weapons or sabotage them.</p><p>Once either America or Soviet Union finds a method, that can nullify
nuclear weapons, the war will be immediately on. It will be postponed
till that moment, and that moment cannot be very long -- both the sides
are continuously working how to find something as an antidote for
nuclear weapons. Right now they don't have any antidote. Till they don't
have the antidote, you can remain assured there is not going to be war.
But soon they may find. There is not much problem in it. If they can
find nuclear weapons, they can find something which negates nuclear
weapons.</p><p>And the religious leaders are trying to convert the poor countries,
the poor people -- that is also the program of the capitalist countries.
Against communism. America don't have a philosophy to argue. Against
communism, America needs Christianity to argue. You cannot convert
Indians into Americans, obviously. You cannot convert Japanese into
Americans, obviously. But you can convert them into Christianity. So
Christianity is serving the capitalist politicians and is spreading
Christianity all over the world.</p><p>And these Christians, their leaders, are against abortion, because if
there is abortion. The religious leaders are against abortion.</p><p>Q:* NOT ALL OF THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* All.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* EVEN THE ONES WHO SAY THEY'RE NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Everyone is against abortion -- religious leaders. The Hindu
religious leaders, the Buddhist religious leaders, the Christian, the
Jews -- they are all against abortion, against birth control methods,
against the pill for they all want more numbers. Number is their
strength.</p><p>Q:* YOU PAINT SUCH AN UTTERLY DARK PICTURE. YOU PAINT SUCH A</p><p>PICTURE OF THE TOTALITY OF SELFISHNESS OF EVERYONE OUTSIDE HERE.</p><p>A:* It is true. It is true. I am neither.…</p><p>I am not a pessimist, I am not an optimist either. I am just a
realist. So if it is night I cannot say it is day. And I am not painting
it dark; it is dark. Absolutely dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THIS IS THE ARK?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* This is Noah's ark. This is where we are trying to pull the
intelligent youth, so they can be saved from AIDS -- outside world will
not be capable to save people from AIDS. They may be able to postpone
the third world war, but who is going to postpone AIDS.</p><p>Q:* HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT HERE?</p><p>A:* Only we can do it.</p><p>We are already doing it. Every sannyasin is going through tests, and
if somebody is found to have AIDS, he is not condemned; he is a victim
of all old religions. We love him, we have made a beautiful place. Two
persons we have found who have AIDS -- we have made a beautiful place,
the most scenic for them, because their life is now short, and we are
supplying them everything that they ever</p><p>wanted. And we are going to create that place bigger -- if more AIDS
people come to the commune, we will put them there with all medical
facilities -- but AIDS cannot be in any way cured. All that can be done
is those people can be prevented from spreading it, and that you cannot
do in the outside world -- it is impossible.</p><p>Q:* YOU'RE SAYING IT HAS TO BE A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT?</p><p>A:* Yes. It has to be a certain commune where people love each other,
respect each other. Even the person who has AIDS does not feel
condemned. In the outside world the people who have AIDS are trying to
hide it, otherwise the whole society will be turning their backs on
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I KEEP HAVING DIFFICULTY... IT'S THE TOTALITY WITH WHICH YOU
CONDEMN US.… Q:* I'VE BEEN TO AIDS HOSPICES, I'VE SEEN THE TREMENDOUS
CARE, THAT DECENT GIVING HUMAN BEINGS PRESENT TO MEN WHO WERE DYING.
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE OF RELIGION WHO YOU CONDEMN BEING GENEROUS AND GOOD AND
OPERATING FROM POINTS OF CONSCIENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It is just your prejudice that has given you all these ideas. For
example, if you look at mother Teresa from your attitude I am just
taking an example, because</p><p>I know her and her work.…</p><p>Anybody who sees her work will appreciate it -- she is doing a great
service to humanity: saving the orphans. But the real purpose of saving
the orphans is converting them to Catholicism. All those orphans are
being adopted by Catholic families. One American Protestant family went
there. They were not aware that they will be refused. They were asked,
"Are you Christians?" They said, "Yes." So they were taken in and the
receptionist informed that, "There are seven hundred orphans -- you can
choose -- but first you fill the register to what religion you belong,"
and then they wrote, "Protestant." And the clerk said, "Wait. Let me
first inquire," and out he comes back and says that, "We don't have any
orphans right now." A minute before there were seven hundred
orphans.</p><p>This man wrote a letter to all biggest Indian newspapers. I condemned
on that letter mother Teresa. She wrote a letter to me. I had told her
that this is absolutely ugly; you are trying to convert orphans into
Catholicism, your concern is not the orphan. Your concern: one more
Catholic.</p><p>Secondly, you are against abortion, you are against birth control,
because if there is birth control and abortion, where you are going to
get orphans -- the whole supply of orphans. So on the outside it is
white house, inside it is all black. @D She wrote to me that, "I will be
praying to God on your behalf, that he should forgive you." Nobody can
say that something is wrong in it, but I know everything is wrong in
that sentence. I wrote her back that there is no God, so</p><p>don't try to befool me. Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf
without my permission? You are interfering into my life, without my
permission -- this is trespass.</p><p>So the sentence looks beautiful, but when you dissect it, what she is
saying that I am wrong, so wrong that I will be punished by God, and she
is right and she is praying for me -- what great generosity.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I CAN'T, I CAN'T SEE THINGS IN THAT BLACK AND WHITE. LIKE YOUR
STORIES ABOUT MOTHER TERESA -- I KNOW NOTHING. BUT I DO KNOW THEY'RE
DECENT PEOPLE OUT THERE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* You have to look more deeply into these generous people. These
are the people who have kept humanity poor.</p><p>Q:* YOU ARE TREATING TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AIDS; I HAVE SEEN THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THEM...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They are not serving, they are not servants of the people, they
are not serving the poor. Service is not a respected word here.</p><p>They are simply sharing their love. And in sharing it is totally
different. You give your love to those people who have very little time
to live... and without any greed. All the religions in the world are
serving the poor with a certain motivation that if they serve the poor
they will reach to the kingdom of God.</p><p>My people have no greed, no motive; there is no God and no
paradise.</p><p>Q:* HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE I SAW WORKING. WON'T</p><p>GET IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* They enjoying it, they are just enjoying it. I have made
everything here a celebration, and that is my religion: celebration. And
we don't bother about anything else. If those two people are sick, it is
part of our celebration to share our energy with them and prevent the
disease spreading to other people. And we can do it perfectly. In the
outside world, I know there are Senators in your parliament who have
AIDS. But these people can hide it -- they are powerful enough -- they
can hide it. And the person who has AIDS knows that he is going to die
within two years time: he will make as many sexual contacts as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I WOULD GO OUT KNOWINGLY CONTAMINATE
PEOPLE IF I KNEW I HAD AIDS</p><p>A:* No, no. It is not a question of knowingly contaminating. The
question is a man who knows that he's going to die. His immediate
reaction will be how much</p><p>he can live in these two years or six months time. He has to live
with speed, with intensity, that he had never done before.…</p><p>So this man is going to have as many sexual contacts as possible. Not
that he is trying to contaminate anybody; he is just the flame which is
going out.</p><p>In the outside world it is happening. Soon you will see.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WELL, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* The question is: you can be contaminated even by kissing and you
may not know, because it is not only sexual intercourse that you get,
get the AIDS.</p><p>Q:* THERE IS A THEORY ABOUT THAT.</p><p>A:* Yes. You can be just kissed by a friend and you may get it. And
without knowing it, you may contaminate other people. It is a wildfire.
And now there are few experts who are saying that there is a possibility
to contaminate even by breathing -- then it becomes absolutely
impossible. But in my commune, we will try to prevent that too.
Everybody, all the sannyasins can use the doctors' mask. You will not be
able to do that in the outside world. That's what I am trying to make
the difference; the difference is here we are living together, caring
about each other, loving each other. Outside world, you have your
family, a small circle friends, but the outside world is big, and it is
beyond control.</p><p>All the states and all the governments are trying to repress the
information about people who have AIDS. For the simple reason, because
it is such a condemnation. And if you repress the information, you are a
criminal. For example, in Oregon, they have made the test for AIDS so
difficult that almost ninety percent people who are suffering from AIDS
will not be caught into it. This is what my medical people have informed
me, that the test they are doing is such that ninety percent will be
cleared out.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THAT.</p><p>A:* Yes, you should talk with them. And these ninety percent people
who are given a clear certificate will not be contaminating anybody
knowingly, but they will be contaminating all the same. Knowledge is not
needed to contaminate anybody.</p><p>The outside world is crushed between nuclear weapons and AIDS.
Perhaps nuclear weapons may be avoided, for the simple reason if we
cannot find an antidote, the nuclear weapons cannot be used, but AIDS is
unavoidable. Unless the world turns into small communes, and people
start going on their own accord to be examined, and every commune
manages for those people special places to live and supplies their
demands -- I don't think the outside world is going to do that.</p><p>Thirty million people in America are almost in Ethiopia.…</p><p>And America cannot do anything for thirty million poor people in
America itself, but it goes on making more nuclear weapons. You have
these mad people in power to be removed immediately. A great concern
should be created in the outside world that these people are mad -- when
your people are dying, even in India -- fifty percent people are on the
line any moment they will be dying like Ethiopia: one thousand people
per day. And the prime minister of India is selling wheat to outside
countries, exporting wheat, because he wants nuclear plant and for that
money is needed. Now these people should be behind bars.</p><p>Rajiv Gandhi is one of my friends... but still I say he should be
imprisoned immediately, because what he is doing is criminal. People are
dying and you are preparing for more death.… Strange. And you call that
they are generous -- the pope is generous and goes on continuously
telling, "No abortion, no birth control, no pill -- these are all
immoral," and to go on creating more children is moral.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THANK YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Although your questions have remained -- I'm worried about your
questions.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-27>The Last Testament, Vol 1

interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY OF INDIA BOMBAY, INDIA</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* FOR ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS, YOU KEPT A MAUN. AND AFTER THAT
, YOU GAVE IT UP. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE A MAUN? WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
TO GIVE IT UP?</p><p>A:* There were many reasons. The most fundamental was concerning my
sannyasins. I don't want them to be intellectually related to me,
because that has nothing to do with the real experience of your
being.</p><p>There were many people who were just hanging around me. They loved my
words, they loved my way of thinking, and I am not a thinker, and I am
not a preacher. I am not a prophet or messiah.</p><p>I want to share my experience and for that only those who are capable
of living with me in silence are ready to understand me. So for three
and a half years I was silent. The basic reasons was that those people
who were hanging around my words, were interested intellectually in me,
dropped out.</p><p>And the people who were in love with me -- not with my words or
theories -- they remained. The moment I saw that all people whose
concern was their head are gone, I have started speaking again. Now with
these people, speaking is a totally different experience.</p><p>They can read me between the words, they can read me between the
lines, and they are not addicted to my words. If I silent they are as
happy as when I am speaking to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ADDICTED TO YOUR WORDS
AND BEING ADDICTED TO YOU?</p><p>A:* There is a great difference. Being addicted to my words is just
being intellectual. Being in love with me is total. Being in love with
me is not a conviction, it is an experience. Being in love with my
words, somebody can destroy it very easily -- just a little better
argument and the person is finished.</p><p>But a person who is in love with me -- nothing can disturb him. His
trust is not based on any argument, it is not philosophical, it is
existential.</p><p>Q:* ONE MAY DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM HIS LOVE FOR YOU; SOME MAY DRAW
SUSTENANCE FROM THEIR LOVE FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHY DO YOU THINK ONE
KIND OF LOVER IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER AND NEEDS TO BE DROPPED
OFF?</p><p>A:* He is not only less important, he is absolutely wrong. His
approach toward me is wrong, and what he is doing with my words --
creating certain belief systems, creating some philosophy, some ideology
which is going to prevent him from knowing himself.</p><p>My whole work is to help people to know themselves, and those who
become addicted with the words are creating a hindrance for themselves.
It does not matter whether they are Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan or
addicted with my words. It is the same thing: They are hanging in their
heads, and the reality is somewhere far deep where no word has ever
entered, and no word is ever possible to enter.</p><p>It is in your uttermost silence, in your meditative peaceful
serenity. So it is not a question only of difference or degrees, they
are polar opposites. Those are the wrong people -- unnecessarily wasting
their time here.</p><p>Q:* BUT DOES A MASTER CHOOSE HIS FLOCK?... HE LEADS HIS OWN LIFE AND
BY HIS EXAMPLE, PEOPLE FOLLOW HIM. HOW DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHO FOLLOWS
HIM?</p><p>A:* I am not a leader. So nobody is allowed to follow me. They are my
fellow travelers, they are my friends, and I am absolutely certain that
who should be my friend.</p><p>Followers -- who cares? Flocks -- who cares? Crowds -- who cares?
These are individuals. I care. And I don't want any wrong person for any
wrong motive to waste his time. It is not harming me -- he is harming
himself. It is out of compassion that I want him to be released.</p><p>And they went away. The device worked perfectly well: they went away
and new people have come in their place. While I was silent they became
sannyasins. Their approach is totally different; their search is
different.</p><p>So remember, I am not a leader, I am not a prophet, I am not a
messiah. I have no business to do with all that company. I am a simple
man just like you and my people. If there is any difference the
difference is very slight.</p><p>The difference is that you are asleep, and I am awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* ONLY THIS MORNING IN YOUR DISCOURSE, YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT A
SIMPLE MAN, YOU ARE EXTRAORDINARY MAN.</p><p>A:* Only an extraordinary man can say it that he is a simple man.</p><p>A simple man cannot say that.</p><p>Q:* OKAY -- THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.</p><p>A:* These are my friends.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU HARDLY INTERACT WITH THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Continuously I am interacting. I am dancing with them, I am
talking with them. I am sitting in silence with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT IT IS HARDLY A ONE-TO-ONE COMMUNION WITH ANYONE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There is no need. I have created the field where just sitting by
my side is enough. Otherwise, they will be gone if there is no
communion. What they will be doing here? For what they will be here? I
dance with them, and they feel my love. They know my love.</p><p>Love is something that need not be expressed in words, or expressed
even in actions. They can see it in my eyes. You are seeing it in my
eyes. Not only they are my friends, you are my friend.</p><p>That's why you are here. This is the beginning of a friendship and it
is not going to end easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IN INDIA YOU WERE PERHAPS IN CLOSER TOUCH ON A DAY-TO-DAY LEVEL
WITH PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. Not much. Just when I was initiating them into sannyas. Q:*
BUT YOU ARE SLOWLY WITHDRAWING YOURSELF?</p><p>A:* Yes, that's true. Because now I can have a contact even from
distance. Now physical contact is not necessary, particularly with my
people. Even though I never come out of my room, they know I am there.
They know and they feel. In the beginning it was necessary to come into
contact because that was the only language those people could have
understood.</p><p>As love deepens, as meditation deepens, distance makes no difference.
I have my communes all around the world. Those people who are in a
commune in Germany, or in Holland or in Switzerland feel me as deeply as
my people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU HAVE THIS GORGEOUS FEMININE MAFIA IN BETWEEN.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That is true. Love always has a feminine mafia in between. It is
really gorgeous!</p><p>You just be here and you see the whole ARABIAN NIGHT is actually
lived here.</p><p>Q:* YOU SPEAK OF FREEDOM OF ALL KINDS: INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL,
SEXUAL. HOW CAN YOU YOURSELF LIVE SUCH A RIGID, BORING, DULL,
DISCIPLINED LIFE?</p><p>A:* It is not disciplined for me. It is not dull for me. It is not
rigid for me. To me, it is the most comfortable life. It is not that I
have disciplined myself, it is that living in many ways I have found the
most comfortable way, the most luxurious way to live.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT SURELY THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND THE MOST LUXURIOUS IS NOT
NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE.</p><p>A:* To me it is. To me it may not be. But whatsoever is the best to
you is luxurious for you. And I don't say that all my sannyasins have to
live in my discipline, the way I live, or the ritual of my living.</p><p>No. They are free to find out their ways. But I have found mine and I
am perfectly contented with it. So it is not dull -- I am every moment
enjoying it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT'S AN EXTREMELY STRUCTURED LIFE.</p><p>A:* It is not structured. It may look from the outside. It may look
from the outside it is structured, it is not structured. I have.…</p><p>For example, I have tried to wake up three o'clock in the morning, I
have tried to wake up four o'clock in the morning, I have tried to wake
up five o'clock in the morning. I have tried to wake up eight o'clock in
the morning -- and finally I found that six suits me the best.</p><p>Now, for an outsider it may look a structured life that every day I
wake up at six, but to me that has been the best moment. After that, the
sleep becomes a headache. Before that, the whole day becomes dull,
sleepy. But exactly at six I have found my time. And now scientists say
that for two hours every night, you have the deepest sleep. If you wake
up after these two hours exactly, you will have the most awakened
day.</p><p>In those two hours, your temperature falls down, so it can be
measured from outside, too. And I have tried that, that when my
temperature falls down, it falls down between four and six.</p><p>And exactly at six -- and this is a later thing -- I had found my
time long before. For thirty years I have been waking up at six. But
this is just recently I found out that scientists say that these two
hours -- wherever in the night they happen, and to different people they
happen at different times. Somebody may find it at five o'clock,
somebody may find three o'clock.</p><p>Vinoba Bhave used to wake up at three o'clock, and that became the
discipline of his ashram. Everybody has to wake up three o'clock. Now
that is nonsense, that is stupid. Vinoba it may be the right time, but
all those people in Vinoba's ashram are unnecessarily suffering. Then in
the whole day they feel dull, sleepy. Change your diet, your diet must
be wrong. Change your other habits, something must be wrong. And the
only thing wrong is that they are waking up at the wrong time.</p><p>So, to me, it is not structured. I have looked for it and found the
right point, the balanced point. The same with my food. I have found
what suits me, how much is needed, how much keeps me in a well-being,
and I go with it.</p><p>I am a very luxurious, lazy, comfort-loving man. And I have found
everything that is needed to make me comfortable. I possess nothing -- I
am the poorest man in the world in that sense. Otherwise, I am the
richest, because my people have made everything available to me. It does
not belong to me, it belongs to the commune, but you will not find such
a commune anywhere in the world -- now, or in the whole history of
man.</p><p>No ashram with five thousand people has ever been there living in
centrally air- conditioned. This is the only city which is completely
air-conditioned in the whole world. And my people are eating the best
food possible. Enjoying their life in different ways. It depends on
them.</p><p>Q:* IT'S SAID YOU ARE THE GURU FOR THE RICH.</p><p>A:* Yes, I am.</p><p>Q:* BUT HOW DO YOU COMBINE YOUR OWN LEVELS OF COMFORT AT EVERY
POINT... WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH YOUR OWN PEOPLE
FOLLOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* My people have every facility available. We have the Italian
restaurant, we have the Chinese restaurant, we have the Indian
restaurant. We have the continental food available. We have the American
food available. All kinds of wines and champagnes, all kinds of cigars
and cigarettes. Everything is available</p><p>-- they have to choose and find.</p><p>Q:* THEY HAVE BASIC NORMS OF COMMUNITY LIVING WHICH THEY FOLLOW,
WHICH MAY BE SELF-IMPOSED, OR STRUCTURED BY THE COMMUNE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Nobody is imposing anything... It is not even self-imposed. The
very word imposed is not right.</p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU COMBINE THIS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF
YOURS WITH THE GROUND RULES OF THE COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* There is no ground rules in the commune. It is a commune of
individuals who are not in any way parts but members, living. And they
have to live according to their own way. If they feel this is fitting to
them -- good. If they feel this is not fitting to them -- good. If they
feel this is not fitting to them, we have all kinds of work
available.</p><p>For example, a doctor is tired with patients and hospitals and he
becomes a sannyasin. We have a hospital, but he does not want to become
a part of the hospital. He is fed up and finished. He wants to go
farming: perfectly good, he does farming. And he enjoys it for the first
time in his life. His whole life, he wanted to do farming.</p><p>There are professors.…</p><p>Q:* THIS COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF A FARMER WANTED TO BE A
DOCTOR...</p><p><br></p><p>A:* A farmer cannot be allowed to be a doctor. He will be sent to
study medicine. Even the doctors who have come here from different
countries are not allowed to practice unless they get Oregon certificate
to practice. The farmer needs no certificate. It is not a qualified job.
It is not something that is harmful to anybody.</p><p>Q:* BUT HE MUST KNOW THE LAND USE LAWS.</p><p>A:* That we are fighting and we are creating our own land use. And
the way we have used the land, Oregonians have never used it.</p><p>For fifty years this land was just lying down barren, a desert. We
have made it an oasis. They will have to change their ground rules for
land use, because we are showing them how land should be used.</p><p>When I had come here there was only one house. And 126 miles of land
-- just barren, dead, only few junipers. Junipers are known as camels of
the trees, but they were also in a very poor, dying condition. Since we
have come we have managed to make dams, we have collected rainwater
enough that all the junipers have become big, thick, green.</p><p>We are making the whole city a green place, and those idiots are
discussing in the courts about land use. They should come here and see
how land has to be used. And they have much land in Oregon lying down
like this. Otherwise, where can you find 126 square miles land so
easily?</p><p>It was for sale for fifty years -- nobody purchased it. What they
will do with a desert? We have changed it into a garden. Go on coming
every year and you will be surprised that every year you will find
expansion, more people, more trees, more birds.</p><p>There was not a single bird when we came here -- now there are
peacocks, swans and -- because of the water -- deer from all other
places have moved. We have thousands of deer now, and we are thinking to
make a deer park especially for them. In fact, deer have never enjoyed
such a luxurious life as they are enjoying here, because we have put the
grass that they love most -- alfalfa. They are eating it too much that
you will not find such fat deer anywhere in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU WILL NOT FIND SUCH PROSPEROUS AND WELL-KEPT SANNYASINS
ANYWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER.</p><p>A:* No, you will not. And these if you go in the night in the roads,
they will be standing in the road, you will have to stop because they
know my sannyasins don't harm anybody. So peacocks are there.…</p><p>In my own garden there are one hundred peacocks, and they won't give
me way to drive. They are standing just there in front of me.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* I WAS ACTUALLY PREVENTED FROM SEEING YOUR HOUSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* You will be prevented, but not by peacocks! For that we have
sannyasins.</p><p>But those peacocks or those deer, they have understood one thing:
that these people are nonviolent, not any way harmful. You can be with
them without any fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE OREGONIANS DON'T THINK SO.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Oregonians are far retarded than the deer. Q:* THEN WHY THE
SUB-MACHINE GUNS?</p><p>A:* For the Oregonians who are retarded, because they will understand
only the machine guns, no other language. It is not for the deer. No
bird, no animal is being killed here. In Oregon there are every year ten
years* freedom from the government to kill deer. All over the state deer
are killed. This is the only place we have stopped... that no deer can
be killed here, and if anybody kills a deer on this land he will be in
trouble.</p><p>Those guns have never been used yet, and I don't think they will be
ever used. Those retarded Oregonians are so afraid, they don't come
near. And we don't have long-distance guns. But if it is needed, we will
have them.</p><p>We are nonviolent. We don't want to do any harm to anybody, but we
are not Gandhians, that if you do harm to us, we will give you the other
cheek. We are not Christians.</p><p>We respect you so much that if you hit, you will get a bigger hit. We
respect your dignity, your individuality, your humanity. Christ's
statement that when</p><p>somebody hits you on one cheek give him the other cheek is a
humiliation of the other man. You are reducing the other man into an
animal, sub-human species. You are becoming holier-than-thou.</p><p>Just by giving one cheek.… What about if he wants to hit you third
time? What cheek you are going to give? We don't give another cheek --
if somebody hits on our cheek, we will hit on both of his cheeks
together, simultaneously. We respect people. We respect their humanity.
We don't want to prove that we are holier than you. We are just as human
as you are.</p><p>The hostility in the Oregonians is perfectly good for us. One thing:
they don't come here -- no disturbance. That's what I wanted, for all
sides fifty miles around we are completely isolated, doing our thing
without any interference, without any trouble.…</p><p>Q:* WHAT IS THAT "OUR THING?"</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Many things. People are meditating. In India it was a trouble.
Others were</p><p>getting disturbed because my meditations are one hundred twelve
methods in which few methods are chaotic, dynamic, active. The people
have to throw out all their screams, shout, throw out their anger,
dance, jump, jog. Naturally the neighbors will be disturbed in the early
morning, and every day the police were there that neighbors are
complaining. So I told my people we have to find a place where no
neighbors are.</p><p>One thing certain, the police is ours, so there is no problem. Q:*
THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.</p><p>A:* No. Not dangerous at all. The police belongs to the state
government. They are part of the police government of the state, they
have been trained by the state, but they are sannyasins and they know
what you are doing -- you are not disturbing anybody. And we have such a
vast land that you can go on doing in one corner and nobody will
know.</p><p>We have a nature institute which allows people to live naked. They
have a special lake for themselves. They can live naked, walk naked in
the forest. Nobody is interfering. Even if you move naked in the streets
of the city, nobody is going even to look back, what is the matter. It
is your thing. That's your thing.</p><p>Q:* IT'S A SAD COMMENT IF AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON IS WALKING NAKED AND
NO ONE LOOKS AROUND.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Because everybody has his own freedom, even looking around is an
interference. More than three seconds -- that's what psychologists have
come to the conclusion -- more than three seconds if you look at a man,
that is interference.</p><p>Q:* WELL, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
ALREADY.</p><p>A:* You have been doing immense interference. But, it is perfectly
okay with me because you at least blink. I don't blink. You should see
that. That blinking, I don't blink. When I am talking, I forget
blinking.</p><p>But everybody is free to do his thing. If somebody wants to hug
somebody on the street -- in India it was a problem. Unnecessary, that
somebody is hugging -- it should be nobody's business. If you don't want
to see, don't see. Just turn your back and go away, or close your
eyes.</p><p>Here, we are having absolute freedom. If people want to hug each
other -- and it is a beautiful experience to hug each other.…</p><p>Q:* BUT HERE YOU HAVE TOTAL FREEDOM TO HUG EACH OTHER, YOU ALSO GIVE
TOTAL FREEDOM TO HIT EACH OTHER. AND THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.…</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. When people hug each other, nobody wants to hit each other;
when people are prevented from hugging, then the only way to touch the
other is by hitting. There is a basic psychology involved in it. Sigmund
Freud said that people have invented guns, arrows, because they were
prevented to hug each other, to love each other.</p><p>Love is really a man trying to enter the woman. Now if that is
prevented, the man will try to enter from a distance with a gun. That
gun is phallic, according to Freud, and all other psychologists agree
with him: that if you allow people total freedom of love, violence will
disappear. Gandhi and people like him are responsible for violence in
the world.</p><p>In Gandhi's ashram, nobody could fall in love with any woman. There
was great discipline that no woman meets in secrecy with any man. His
own secretary Karilal* could not follow this discipline. His own sons
could not follow this discipline. The discipline is stupid.</p><p>But when you prevent people from loving, then their very energy of
love becomes hate. Hate is not different from love, it is love standing
on its head, doing sirshasan*.</p><p>Q:* IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BELIEVE THAT IF HITLER HAD A JEWISH
GIRLFRIEND TO MAKE LOVE TO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENCE ON THE
JEWISH POPULATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Certainly. Hitler was rejected from everywhere. His parents
rejected him, he was never given love by his parents. He was
continuously condemned. He wanted to become an architect; no school of
architecture allowed him. Then</p><p>finally he became a soldier. Now there is no way to avoid the fact
that the man was basically interested in art, in architecture, but being
denied from everywhere, only army was the place where he was
accepted.</p><p>And even from the army -- after the first world war -- he was thrown
out. He was one of the most rejected persons in the world, and he took
good revenge -- he did well.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE DID WELL? YOU WOULD SUPPORT WHAT HE DID?</p><p>A:* It means he has given you a lesson that: love people, respect
people, a person should not be rejected so much that he becomes simply a
maniac. That's what you made Adolf Hitler.…</p><p>Adolf Hitlers will be born again and again if we cannot allow people
freedom of love, warmth, dignity, respect -- just for being themselves.
We respect people if somebody reaches on the Everest -- some Edmund
Hillary*, then we respect him. If somebody invents something, we respect
him. If somebody is a painter like Picasso, we respect him, but we don't
respect people just for being themselves.</p><p>Everybody cannot be a Picasso and everybody need not go to the
Everest, and it will be silly. We have to respect people as they are
without any demands on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU DON'T EITHER -- YOU ATTACKED MOTHER TERESA RECENTLY.</p><p>A:* I attack Mother Teresa because she is doing so much harm to
humanity. These are the people -- Mother Teresa is only symbolic, I call
her Mother Teresa the Terrible. These people, Teresa, or Polack the
Pope, or Jesus Christ, or Mahatma Gandhi, all these people in a very
subtle way.… I never suspect their intentions, their intentions may be
good, but their actions are dangerous: these are the people who are
keeping the world poor.</p><p>Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor." Now this is something absolutely
wrong. The poor are not the blessed, they are the cursed! -- the
condemned. But he consoles them by saying that you are blessed.</p><p>Q:* BUT YOU ARE SELECTIVELY USING THAT VERSE. THE FULL VERSE IS:
BLESSED ARE THE POOR FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH. SO THOSE WHO
INHERIT THE EARTH CAN NEVER BE POOR, SO HE WAS USING THE WORD POOR
PURELY METAPHORICALLY.</p><p>A:* Just wait a minute.… Just wait a minute, you are quoting wrongly.
I was quoting rightly: blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the
kingdom of God, not earth.</p><p>Q:* THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS -- THE KING JAMES VERSION SAYS THE
EARTH.</p><p>A:* There are not two versions!</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE KINGS JAMES VERSION SAYS THE EARTH.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* It is the kingdom of God basically in Hebrew. Kingdom of the
earth is already possessed by the rich, it is already inherited. Jesus
can only promise something in far away future, after death. All
religions have been playing that game of promising people things beyond
death. There is no evidence of anything beyond death, whether poor enter
into the paradise, or rich enter -- more probability is that rich will
enter.</p><p>There is no possibility for poor in paradise if there is no
possibility for them here on earth! And these people... Teresa
collecting orphans, what she is doing? Creating more poverty in the
world. She is against abortion, she is against birth control, she is
against the pill. These are sins. Naturally, if these things are there,
orphans will disappear, and with orphans disappearing, who is going to
give Nobel prize to Mother Teresa?</p><p>I condemned her; she wrote a letter to me. In the letter she said,
that "I will pray to God to forgive you."</p><p>Now the sentence looks perfectly nice, but not to me. It is nasty. I
wrote her back, that "In the first place, I don't believe in any God, so
who are you to pray to a God who does not exist? At least you should
have asked me.</p><p>"Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf? I have not given the
authority to you, and I have not committed any sin that God should
forgive me. If He meets me, He will have to ask forgiveness from me,
because what He has done to the world is enough! All these Tamerlane,
Genghis Khan, Nadirshah*, Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf
Hitler, Mussolini, Joseph Stalin -- who is responsible for all these
people? Who is responsible for Ethiopia dying? Who is responsible for
half the world being poor and on the verge of death? Who is responsible
for nuclear weapons?</p><p>"If God is the creator, and if He is omnipotent, omniscient, He knows
everything</p><p>-- past, present, future -- He knows that there will be Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. And even knowing that, He creates the world? He knows that
there will be a nuclear war, and people are piling up nuclear weapons.
Even the day he created the world he knew that one day there will be a
nuclear war, and millions of people will suffer tremendous torture and
death. And this is your God," I told her. She never replied. I again
wrote her, that "You reply, because otherwise I am going to sue you in
the court. Who can on my behalf -- without my permission -- ask my
forgiveness from God?"</p><p>These people are simply trying to increase their number. All those
orphans become Catholics; all those poor people, aboriginals, become
Christians. The hospital, the schools, the food -- these are all
strategies. Islam had the strategy of the sword. Christians have the
strategy -- because the world has changed, ways have changed -- they
come with bread and butter and one hand and Bible in another.
Mohammedans used to come sword in one hand and Koran sarif* in another
hand.</p><p>But it is the same -- just to purchase you. They are using people's
poverty to make great numbers of Christians, because number has power.
It is simply politics, nothing else; there is no religion in it. Just
the pope before this polack who is now the pope, was a homosexual --
well-known over the whole Italy. And he was a bishop before becoming a
pope, in Milan. And the whole Milan knew because he was continuously
moving with a homosexual, a young man.</p><p>Q:* BUT THAT'S PURELY A SEXUAL PREFERENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That's what I am saying, that it is perversion, not
preference.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* YOU MEAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO BELIEVES IN FREE SEX, YOU WOULD
OBJECT TO PEOPLE EXERCISING A SEXUAL PREFERENCE?</p><p>A:* No, it is not a preference. Otherwise soon you will be making
love to the camera, love to the electric pole. And please, don't disturb
my junipers. It is not preference, it is unnatural. It is a religious
contribution to humanity, this homosexuality.</p><p>It started in the monasteries where only men were living and no woman
was allowed in. It started into nunneries where only women were living
and no man was allowed. Naturally, man is intelligent enough to find
some way.</p><p>All the monks have been either masturbators or homosexuals, but in
some way they have to do something. Their biology you cannot change by
just preaching. Their bodies won't listen to your Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT YOU WERE A CELIBATE AT TWENTY-ONE. WHY CAN'T THEY BE?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I have never been a celibate. Q:* YOUR BIBLE SAYS THAT.</p><p>A:* I have never been a celibate. If people believe, that is their
foolishness. I have always loved women, and perhaps more women than
anybody else. You can see my beard. It has become grey so quickly
because I have lived so intensely that I have compressed in fifty years
almost two hundred years.</p><p>Q:* OF SEXUALITY?</p><p>A:* Yes. But I am not a homosexual. These people have been talking of
celibacy and creating sexual perversion. And the sexual perversion has
led to the disease AIDS, which can kill almost two-thirds of humanity.
Who will be responsible for it?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN SEXUAL PERVERSION AND SEXUAL
EXPERIMENTATION?</p><p>A:* There is no sexual experimentation. Sex is a purely biological
thing, absolutely determined by biology. For example, in the wild no
animal is homosexual, but in a zoo if only male animals are there and no
female is available, they turn into homosexuals. Your world is a zoo,
not a wild place.</p><p>In a wild jungle, nobody, no animal ever turns into a homosexual.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* SO WOULD YOU, LIKE ROUSSEAU, TALK IN TERMS OF GOING BACK TO
NATURE, TO THE WILD?</p><p>A:* No. I am not saying back to nature, I am saying forward to
nature. Not back -</p><p>- back is not my vocabulary -- forward to nature. There are
tremendous treasures hidden in nature which these perverted people have
denied humanity to enjoy. I am against these people because what they
are saying and what they are doing ultimately results into something
like a curse.</p><p>All the religions have been preaching celibacy. And nobody has ever
bothered whether celibacy is medically possible or not. Even Mahatma
Gandhi at the age of seventy was having wet dreams in his night. And you
cannot find a more sincere man trying more sincerely than he tried to be
a celibate. For forty years, no success. And do you know in the end he
started sleeping with a naked woman? But Gandhians don't talk about
it.</p><p>Gandhians even approached Mahatma Gandhi, that please don't do it.
Vinoba was one of them, Kalila* was another, Maulana Azad*, Kreplani*,
all asked him, "Please don't do this experimentation" -- in your
language. It was not experimentation; it was forty years of failure of
celibacy.</p><p>And all these popes -- just two days before, one Christian minister
has been jailed for one and a half years because he was using small
children. That is experimentation. In the pulpit, in the church, he is
talking about celibacy and inside the church he is abusing small
children.</p><p>On father filed the case. He got for one and half years jail. How
many others have come, because they were afraid to say anything against
the religious leader. But now when he is in jail, many other children
have said that the same he has been doing with them.</p><p>But this is not about one priest I am saying. All the priests have to
do it! We are forcing them to do it. We respect their celibacy, and that
respect is a bribe to remain celibate. And their biology does not know
about your respectability -- their biology has its own laws and it
follows its own laws.</p><p>The people who have been consoling the poor are the enemies of the
poor. Poverty can be destroyed immediately. All that is needed is that
nations should disappear -- only then wars can disappear.</p><p>And seventy-five percent of every nation's income is going into war
efforts. Even America is doing eighty percent income pouring into
nuclear weapons. Now if the whole world stops this nonsense, what is the
need to be poor. We have so much energy, so much money, so much
scientific intelligence.</p><p>But strange, in England, in Europe, in America, too, they are
destroying food and Ethiopia is dying, and soon India will be in the
same position. And if you see Rajiv Gandhi, tell him that he will be
responsible for India's poverty and people dying there, because he is
exporting wheat OUTSIDE India and his own people are on the verge of
death -- half of the country. But he wants a nuclear plant. Tell him
that this is not a child's games, and you don't understand anything
about humanity. You better go and become a pilot again, that is your
place. You don't understand and you don't need to be a prime minister of
a country which is suffering from poverty and you are looking for
creating a nuclear plant. For what?</p><p>Even if India puts every penny into creating nuclear weapons, it will
take three hundred years for them to be equal in power to America or the
Soviet Union. And do you think for three hundred years, America and
Soviet Union will be staying where they are? It is stupid -- absolutely
stupid -- for a country like India to think of nuclear weapons, atomic
energy.</p><p>But they go on saying to the poor -- in India, all Indian religions:
Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, all go on saying -- "It is your past life's
bad actions, that's why you are poor." That's the reason -- because of
these religions -- for five thousand years at least India has never
revolted, suffered all kinds of poverty, slavery, accepted it, because
the religious leaders were telling them that if you reward or if you do
anything against it, you will have to suffer in the future life. Let me
tell you one thing: you will be surprised. One of the Jaina great
teachers</p><p>in India is Acharya Tulsi -- it is a Jaina sect, Terapanth. He is the
head of that community. Their basic philosophy is that if somebody is
dying of thirst and you have water, don't give it to him because he is
suffering from his past life's karmas. And giving him water means
interfering into the punishment. He will be punished soon again. He
cannot get rid of it, and by interfering, you have committed a crime;
now you will suffer also.</p><p>If somebody is drowning, you simply go on walking. Let him drown --
it is his past life's actions, and you should not interfere in any way.
For example, if you pull that man out of the water and tomorrow he
murders somebody, you are also responsible in that murder. You see, the
logic is great. If you have not saved that</p><p>man, the murder would not have happened. So in the next life you will
also suffer because you saved that man and took part into murder.</p><p>If you teach people for thousands of years that it is your bad
actions in past lives which create poverty, you are stopping them from
revolting, you are stopping them from doing something to change their
situation. You are telling them, "Just accept the situation in which you
are." And that's how the East has accepted and remained poor.</p><p>And still you want me that I should not speak against these people --
Buddha, Mahavira? I have to speak. To me these are far bigger criminals
than Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, because those people have done
very small harm. One million Jews Adolf Hitler killed, but how many poor
people Mahavira has killed? And living in poverty is far more dangerous,
far more suffering than dying in a beautifully, scientifically managed
gas chamber in Germany. Within a second you are smoke, holy smoke,
rather than suffering for millions of years.</p><p>No, I am against all these criminals. And I mean what I say.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* DO YOU THINK THAT IF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD DID NOT INVEST SUCH
A LARGE PART OF THEIR MONEY, OF THEIR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN NUCLEAR
ARSENALS, THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT MORE MEANINGFULLY? THEY WOULD HAVE
FOUND SOME ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF CREATING A SITUATION OF TERROR IN THE
WORLD?</p><p>A:* The question is whether they invest in nuclear weapons or into
something else all depends on us, not on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* IT IS BORN OUT OF THE DESIRE TO CONQUER, TO RULE.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I understand, but now it is absolutely idiotic. Up to now it was
meaningful to conquer. With the nuclear weapons you cannot conquer --
nobody is going to be victorious and nobody is going to be defeated. All
are going to be finished. In that way, nuclear weapons have served great
cause: now war is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* M.A.D. -- MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes. So it is meaningless. They are not going for the third world
war -- they will talk about it, talk about peace. They will play the
games, and they will put small nations into fights and wars so they can
sell their out-of-date weapons to them. But they are not going for a big
war. Pakistan and India may go into a war, Bangladesh and India may go
into a war, but Russia and America are not going into war because both
are perfectly aware what it means. There is no victory.</p><p>War was meaningful, you are right, because it was conquering. Now
with nuclear weapons, the whole situation changes. We can put this whole
energy in</p><p>conquering new planets, going to the stars. We can conquer nature
which is deteriorating, and we can put the nature back into its
harmoniousness as it was always. We can feed people. We can create
medical food, just pills. If you cannot grow more wheat, you can just
swallow a pill and that will do.</p><p>The whole world has to be made aware in what a situation we have
reached: that war is absolutely meaningless. So now no more pouring your
energies into more nuclear weapons.</p><p>Q:* THEN WHY ARE YOU INVESTING IN MISSILE SILOS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* I am investing only in toy guns. Those toy guns are enough to
keep the Oregonians afraid. They don't do any harm, but just keeping
them there, they remain far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THE RUMOR THAT YOU ARE SHIFTING TO AUSTRALIA, ARE THEY RIGHT? DO
YOU HAVE ANY SUCH PLANS WHATSOEVER?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No. I will be visiting. Q:* WHEN IS THAT?</p><p>A:* That will depend. If America wants me to go out, to Australia.…
Perhaps I may stay there forever. I have a beautiful commune there, on
the sea beach. I may stay there. So there is a great opportunity for
America to get rid of me. But first, my green card. With green card, I
am not going out of America. I am going to fight up to Supreme
Court.</p><p>They have six clauses -- six types of people to apply for American
green card. I have applied on five. On each I will fight separately. One
file will take twenty years to be finished by the time it reaches to the
Supreme Court. On five grounds again I will start on the second ground.
One hundred years, they cannot do anything to me. And the sixth clause
is not difficult for me -- that is marriage. I can marry as many women
as they want. But they cannot throw me out of America. If they are
intelligent, they should immediately issue my green card, then perhaps I
may never come back. If Australia is there... and I have my communes in
beautiful places. In Holland we have purchased a great ancient Christian
monastery.</p><p>And it was meant for Christian monks and a school for Christian
children, beautiful gardens, three hundred people's accommodation. And
we are renovating it. I may stay in Holland.</p><p>I may stay in Germany. In Germany we have twelve communes of the same
size. Germany is my country. Now the color red is no more connected with
communists, it is connected with me. And we have sannyasins in the
Soviet Union. We have sannyasins in other communist countries. We have
sannyasins</p><p>in the East Germany. They are not only there, they want to make a
commune. I am stopping them because if you make a commune and you come
over-ground, you will be in difficulty. You remain underground. But they
are so excited they want to make a commune in East Berlin. My sannyasins
in Soviet Union are more excited than anywhere else.</p><p>Q:* HOW DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM? OR HOW DO THEY STAY IN TOUCH
WITH YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That I cannot say to you. But I am in touch and they are in
touch, and everything is going just groovy! Anything...?</p><p>Q:* IF RUMORS ARE TO BE BELIEVED, ON THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER, YOU ARE
STARTING A NEW PROGRAM WHICH WILL POSSIBLE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH
AIDS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* That's only a rumor.</p><p>Q:* WHY IS THIS PARTICULAR AFFLICTION SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP
TALKING ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE?</p><p>A:* Because it has no medicine, no cure. Q:* NEITHER HAS CANCER.</p><p>A:* Cancer only of one type, but there are many types of cancer which
have cure. They can be operated.</p><p>And the people who have cancer are not contagious. They will not
spread the cancer all over the world. AIDS is a different phenomenon --
no cure. The person is sure to die within two years. The person can
contaminate not only by sexual intercourse, but by kissing. If his
saliva comes in contact to you, you can get it. Kissing is going to be
prohibited. In my commune I have told people that you drop kissing
completely. You learn the art of Eskimos who rub noses... which is far
more hygienic, and no fear of any epidemic. At the most, cold, which is
not a disease. If you don't take medicine, it goes away in seven days;
if you take medicine, it goes away in one week.</p><p>I am concerned about AIDS, certainly, particularly for my people. My
communes are creating every prohibition, precaution. Every sannyasin is
going through tests.</p><p>We have found two sannyasins. For them we have made a beautiful...
the most scenic place in the commune we have given to them. And we will
take care of them, and they are respectable people, they need not hide
it. They are simply victims of religions.</p><p>In the outside it is totally different. If somebody is found to have
AIDS he will be just treated the way lepers used to be treated in the
past. He will be no more a respectable citizen. In his own eyes he will
fall down. He will not be allowed into restaurants. He may not be
allowed to visit. Even his own family would not like him to live in the
house.</p><p>So what is happening -- which is the most dangerous thing -- that
people who have AIDS are hiding it. They are bribing physicians,
doctors, and hiding it. I know absolutely certainly that one of the
senators has AIDS. Now he has every power to hide it, and he will be
continuously spreading it.</p><p>If it can spread even by kissing or by saliva... and there are few
experts who are thinking that there is a possibility that if the disease
becomes of enormous proportions, which it is becoming.… But governments
are hiding, state governments are hiding, because nobody wants to accept
the fact that your country is full of homosexuals -- because it is a
homosexual disease.</p><p>Q:* BUT IT HAS SPREAD BEYOND THE GAYS.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* Yes, it has gone beyond now. It is not confined to only
homosexuals, but it is created in homosexuality. Then it spreads. It can
go to a woman; then from women it can go to another man who has never
been homosexual. And there is no way.…</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* BUT TO STOP KISSING IS LIKE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T SHAVE BECAUSE
YOU MIGHT GET A NICK IN YOUR CHEEK WITH THE BLADE WHICH MIGHT GIVE YOU
TETANUS.</p><p><br></p><p>A:* No, it is not that way. In fact, a man shaving his beard looks
like a woman -- it is ugly. As far as women are concerned, they love
beards. You can ask my women here. A man without a beard and a mustache
is just half man. Just think of a woman with a mustache and beard --
looking like a SARDARJI*. That's what is happening to men. A stupid idea
because men biologically feels attracted to the feminine physiology --
her face. He thinks that the woman's face is beautiful because it is
without beard and without mustache. He is just a fool -- he does not
know simple laws of nature. To a woman a man without a beard and
mustache has no appeal. And you can see that all your prophets, all your
messiahs... They had beards, and beautiful beards. And they influenced
tremendously. Most of it will go to the beard.</p><p>It happened when Lincoln was standing for the presidentship in
America, he had no beard, no mustache. He was a thin man, tall man, and
ugly. While he was campaigning one small girl told him, "Uncle, if you
grow a beard and a mustache you will look far more beautiful." And the
idea got into his mind and he grew his beard and mustache. Now it is
very difficult whether that played some part in his winning.</p><p>I am not saying that there are not exceptions. I am simply saying
that it is not like a beard that out of fear you stop shaving -- because
if that becomes the situation, then ninety-nine percent people die on
the bed, so don't sleep on the bed! Just sleep on the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>Q:* THEN HOW DO YOU STOP KISSING? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.</p><p>A:* No. Kissing is totally a different matter, because we can find
better ways. Q:* OF FOREPLAY? HARDLY ANY.</p><p>A:* Many! Because you don't know the feminine body. It is all erotic.
Q:* I'LL ASK YOU THOSE QUESTIONS SEPARATELY, PERHAPS!</p><p>A:* You can ask separately, but for this you have to remember that
the woman's whole body is erotic. You can play it from anywhere. It is a
strange musical instrument. Vatsyayana knew it five thousand years
before when he wrote his sutras. He suggests that lovers should press
each other's earlobes and that gives great joy. That seems very
hygienic. And, in fact, there are tribes... Eskimos never kiss, they rub
noses.…</p><p>Q:* THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.…</p><p>A:* No. They know, because they see the missionaries and they think
that these are fools. Even Eskimos think the missionaries are fools
because they are transferring diseases to each other. It is not that
they are unaware of kissing, they are perfectly aware. There are
aboriginals in India, in Thailand and in other parts of the world where
rubbing of the nose is the common practice, kissing is not.</p><p>And when something like AIDS is standing on your door, it is a small
question of being intelligent to take precautions. And at least try
once, and how you feel... you may enjoy it more than kissing. At least
it is more fun -- something new and novel.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-28>The Last Testament, Vol 1

interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH KEYI TV, EUGENE OREGON, TRACY BERRY,</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ABOUT THESE PRESS INTERVIEWS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE PAST FEW
WEEKS: JOURNALISTS HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT YOU FROM THESE SESSIONS.
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT SOME OF THE JOURNALISTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE? YOU'VE CALLED YOURSELF THE WORLD'S
GREATEST SHOWMAN. ARE YOU PLANNING TO PERHAPS TAKE YOUR SHOW ON THE
ROAD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, the roads will come to Rome. All roads will be coming to
Rajneeshpuram. I'm not going on any road.</p><p>Q: DOES THIS HERALD AN EXPANSION PHASE FOR RAJNEESHEES -- YOUR GOING
SO PUBLIC?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are increasing, and they are expanding all over the world. Q:
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT SORT OF EFFORTS ARE GOING ON?</p><p>A: The same that is happening here is happening around the world in
all of my communes. People are trying to live in a new way.</p><p>The past of humanity has failed, utterly failed. It has not been able
to create a better man, a better society. Civilization has only remained
a word; it has not been yet actualized.</p><p>In my commune, you can see the beginnings of a new man. The commune
is not a family. It is just the opposite -- dissolution of the family.
Families are small units which have kept people confined -- their love
confined, their respect confined.</p><p>A commune is coming into the open, out of your small circle of
hypnotic conditioning. In the commune you are not a Hindu, nor a
Christian, nor a Mohammedan. In the commune you are not a communist nor
a fascist. The commune does not live according to any ideology --
political, or religious, or social. Each individual lives according to
his freedom, according to his responsibility, according to his
meditative consciousness. And the more a person meditates, goes deeper
into himself, he starts living on the outside with new values which he
had never known before: love, compassion, friendliness, joy, celebration
-- and for no reason at all.</p><p>People celebrate when there is some reason to celebrate. We simply
celebrate, because celebration in itself is a reason. There is no need
for any other reason. It is enough unto itself.</p><p>Our people are free in every possible way. So we are dropping the old
patterns of jealousy, competitiveness, politics. There is no politics,
there is no competitiveness, there is no jealousy. If one lover moves to
another lover, there is no antagonism. It is simply understood that it
is human.</p><p>Many inhuman things have been imposed on man. For example, marriage
is inhuman. It is forcing two people to live together for a future about
which they know nothing.</p><p>Here, this moment is enough, and if the next moment also you find
yourself loving each other -- good. And if you find that it is
difficult, it has become nagging, it has become poisoned -- that you are
no more interested in each other</p><p>-- then to go on living is ugly. It together is wasting energy, the
life of two people Both can move, and both can move before things become
bad, before things go sour. When they are sweet, friendly, they can move
with gratefulness for all those beautiful moments that they lived
together.</p><p>Q: DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A MORAL CODE? IS THERE A WRONG? IS THERE
A RIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I don't have any moral code. All moral codes are inventions of
different societies in different geographies in different situations,
but there is no moral code which is universal.</p><p>So I don't teach any moral code, because what is moral today may
become immoral tomorrow. What is immoral today may become moral
tomorrow. So I don't teach a code that fixes people with the past. I
give them insight to see, to be clear, to be aware, to be conscious so
that they can find what is good, what is bad in each situation without
any code.</p><p>My people are not living according to any code, any doctrine, any
creed. They are living according to their consciousness. And the whole
effort is, how to raise your consciousness higher and higher. So to me,
there is only one morality and that is being a conscious being. And then
act out of it. You cannot act wrongly.</p><p>Q: THE PERCEPTION OUTSIDE OF RAJNEESHPURAM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TEACHING AMOUNTS TO ANARCHY -- MAYBE A PLEASANT SORT OF ANARCHY.</p><p>A: That is absolutely wrong. Anarchy is a reaction against what the
governments have done to man. It is not a revolution; it is simply a
reaction. And by reactions you cannot live.</p><p>For example, the founder of anarchy, Prince Kropotkin, simply wants
all the governments to be dissolved immediately. That is stupid, because
the man is not capable to cope -- even with all the courts, all the
police, all the army and the whole hierarchy of government. Man is
criminal, man is murderer, man is rapist</p><p>-- so a this is stupid idea to dissolve all the governments.</p><p>My idea is not for anarchy -- that is not my goal -- but to create
better individuals. Finally, perhaps one day we will have so many
conscious individuals on the earth that there is no need of any
government. But I am not preaching anarchy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU COUNSEL YOUR FOLLOWERS TO DEAL WITH THE LAWS OF THE
LAND? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU URGE THEM TO PERFORM CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WHERE
THEY SEE IT NECESSARY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, We fight the government, the government agencies. And we
follow their rules, because we are playing their game. And we can play
the game better than they are playing. And in four year's time we have
proved to them that how stupid they are. Laws are made by them, rules
are made by them, but we can find loopholes in their laws and loopholes
in their rules. And we are going to be here, and going to fight to the
ultimate end.</p><p>So we are not against their laws. But their laws are made by mediocre
politicians, and we have far more intelligent people to fight. We have
the biggest law firm in the whole world -- four hundred legal experts
continuously getting ready for more and more fight on more and more
grounds.</p><p>And your governments -- state government, the federal government --
they are all doing many things illegally, against the Constitution. It
is their Constitution, it is their law, but they are doing things
against it, going against it.</p><p>We will be in favor of the Constitution and we will go against them.
We will be in favor of the laws and prove to them that they are acting
illegally. So our way of fighting is not to disobey. Our way is to prove
that we are obeying the laws and you are disobeying your laws. And laws
are yours, made by you, and you have committed so many stupidities in
them that we are perfectly capable to fight with you.</p><p>Q: IT MUST BE DISAPPOINTING TO YOU TO HAVE MET WITH THE LEVEL OF
REJECTION AND PERSECUTION.</p><p>A: No. In fact, it was perfectly expected. Any new idea has to be
ready to accept the challenge of hostility, rejection, persecution. I
would have been disappointed if they had ignored me. They could not
ignore me.</p><p>And strange, it is a small commune, living in a desert trying to make
the desert green, an oasis, and they are terrified. These people who are
living, loving, dancing, singing -- what harm are these people going to
do to them?</p><p>In four years' time we have not committed a single crime. In the
commune not a single rape has happened. There is no prostitute in the
commune. There is no murderer in the commune. There is no thief in the
commune. The police in the commune are just sitting, doing nothing,
because there is nothing.</p><p>We have the city magistrate, but in the court, in four years, nobody
has been brought as a criminal. Against such peaceful, loving people the
whole of Oregon is afraid. They must be just retarded people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT ALSO SOUNDS, THOUGH, LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING SOME OF THE COMMOTION
YOU'RE CAUSING AROUND THE STATE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Mm? I want -- because that gives us strength. Every challenge
brings us strength. And we will go on creating more and more challenges.
We will not let them sleep peacefully. We sleep peacefully -- we have no
trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAS THE FUROR THROUGHOUT OREGON AND THE U.S. CONTRIBUTED AT ALL TO
THIS CYNICISM?</p><p>A: The U.S. has nothing to give to me. In fact, in that way I am
disappointed. I was thinking that America must be more intelligent than
any other country, less prejudiced than any other country -- really
democratic -- but being here for four years what I have found is that
democracy is just in the name. Behind the democracy everything
undemocratic is going on.</p><p>Our own experience is a proof of it. I have not found that America is
really a country where individuals are respected, freedom of speech is
respected. It is only talked about. And I don't see any sense of humor
-- not at all.</p><p>They have been taking us so seriously -- and we are taking them so
nonseriously; but they cannot understand. We are all the time joking,
but they cannot understand simple jokes. They are having secret meetings
-- the governor, the attorney general, and they did not allow -- they
were discussing us and they did not allow any one of our representatives
to be there. If you are discussing us -- at least it is simple courtesy
that at least one person from our side should be there and you should
listen to what we have to say. They did not allow... they did not allow
any journalist either. The governor said, "After our secret meeting I
will talk to you and inform you." And whatever he informed us about was
simply lies</p><p>and nothing else because we have found the confidential file which
says just the opposite.</p><p>What he had said to the people, to the journalists, to the media --
he was saying that everything is under control and we are pacifying
people, there is no problem to be worried, the heat is cooling down.</p><p>And in the secret report that they prepared inside they are alerting
the army to remain ready. Any moment, if they are ordered, they have to
reach Rajneeshpuram in three hours.</p><p>Now, what kind of people are these? And what is the need of bringing
the army here? We are not a nation, that you have to attack us? And they
are lying to the media that things are getting settled and there is no
problem. If there is no problem, then why is the army given the alert?
And why have you given them a time, that within three hours you have to
reach Rajneeshpuram?</p><p>So these people, I don't think, have any sense of humor. They are
just dodos.</p><p>Q: WHO DO YOU FEEL HAS TREATED YOU FAIRLY SINCE YOU'VE COME TO THIS
COUNTRY? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS BEEN AGAINST YOU.</p><p>A: Not everyone. Most of the journalists have been very fair, very
loving. And those are the only people I have come in contact with from
the outside world. And they have been intelligent and they could
understand what I am saying and they could understand the sense of
humor.</p><p>All the journalists who have come here, except one or two, have
enjoyed the place, loved the place, wanted to come again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DID YOU PLAN TO MAYBE GO OUT AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE? A: No...</p><p>Q: IF YOU WENT OUT AND MET OREGON AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE, AND THEY
FOUND OUT YOU WEREN'T THIS HORRIBLE MONSTER, IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF
RED-ROBED FOLLOWERS, IT WOULD BE EASIER THAT WAY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, it would not be, because I have been for thirty years in
India, moving around the country; no, it is not so. Shoes have been
thrown at me; stones have been thrown at me. I am speaking and in the
crowd a band is playing so nobody can hear what I am saying.</p><p>Poison has been given me twice, to kill. And the last thing before I
left was an attempt on my life.</p><p>So I know... and I have had enough of it, so I want to be here; if
anybody is thirsty, he can come. If he wants to think me a monster, so
far so good. That will give him good nightmares.</p><p>Q: WELL, LET'S SAY, I'M THE AVERAGE PERSON IN EUGENE OR PORTLAND, I
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT'S ON THE NEWS OR IN THE PAPER, DOES
THAT MEAN THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE TO RAJNEESHPURAM TO FIND OUT OR HOW WOULD
I GET.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's the only way. You have to come. And it is such an
experiment that there is no other way, you have to come here and be here
and meet people and see with your own eyes what is happening.</p><p>And it is open. It is not like Soviet Russia, that you can not enter
here, that you cannot meet people, that you cannot remain for a few days
as our guest. And you can move freely, nobody is preventing you. That's
the only way.</p><p>And we have our communes all over the world. So if Germans wants to
know about us, in Germany we have twelve communes. If Holland wants to
know us, we have our communes there. On the same pattern, the same way
of life, the same approach towards life, we have places in Australia, in
India. We are opening in Japan, and soon we'll be all over the world.
Small oases, so whoever wants to know about us has to travel and visit
our communes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE RUMORS THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BE MOVING TO AUSTRALIA... AND
YET, I SEE A LOT OF EXPANSION GOING ON HERE, WHAT IS THE REAL STORY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was just joking. Because Australia seems to be so much afraid of
me. Only Sheela has been there, my secretary, and she has created so
much turmoil there, that they are getting very much afraid that I may be
coming, so I told the journalist that yes, I am coming; tell them get
ready. But I am not going anywhere. I am going to be here and fight the
American idiots who are destroying democracy and all human values for
which America stands. It is a very strange situation. I, I am fighting
for the American Constitution, American values, against the Americans.
But this will expose America to the whole world. That is their fear. And
I'm not going anywhere.</p><p>Q: QUESTION ON THE JOKING: YOU'VE RATTLED SO MANY PEOPLE'S CAGES BY
SAYING, "OH, WELL MAYBE I'LL GO TO AUSTRALIA." OR OH, YES, I WANT TO
TAKE OVER THE WORLD."</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p>Q: DO YOU AND SHEELA SIT DOWN AND SAY, "OK, LET'S FRIGHTEN AUSTRALIA
THIS WEEK," OR IS IT...</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, it is spontaneous. There is no need. Because we are absolutely
nonserious about it. In Joke, everything is allowed. There is no
problem.</p><p>Q: THE CONSTITUTION OFFERS FREEDOM OF RELIGION. IT SEEMS THAT WHAT
YOU ARE OFFERING IS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO, HOW DO YOU COUNSEL PEOPLE TO PURSUE THAT? IS FREEDOM FROM
RELIGION POSSIBLE?</p><p>A: It is possible, and should be made possible, because religion has
dominated people, exploited people, kept poverty in the world. Religion
has committed so many crimes that it is time we should be finished with
it... Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor." The same is the tone of
Buddha, the same is the preaching if Mahavira.</p><p>They all are consoling the poor people that you will inherit the
kingdom of God. Marx was right only on one point in his all writings:
that religion has been the opium of the people. And I agree with him
only on that point. It has been the opium! They have drugged people to
remain poor... Even in a country like America which has all riches --
the richest country -- there are thirty million people suffering from
poverty. Thirty million people are suffering from poverty, and Ronald
Regan goes on piling up on nuclear weapons. And there is no point in
having more nuclear weapons, because both Soviet Russia and America
combined have enough nuclear weapons to destroy humanity seven hundred
times. So what is the point now? Nuclear weapons have made war
absolutely obsolete. It is meaningless. The whole meaning of war is to
win. Now there will be no winner and nobody defeated. The whole of life
will be finished. So now war is against life and in favor of death. It
is not a question if American democracy or Russian communism, it is a
question of whether life has to exist on the earth or not. Thirty
million people in your own country are starving on the streets, and you
are preparing for war. And you are already equipped too much. But the
politicians are not interested; in fact they want poor people because
they can always be purchased. The religious people want poor people
because they can be easily converted. That is what Christianity is doing
all over the world. Islam used to do it -- in one hand the sword, in the
other hand the Koran. You can choose: either the Koran, or the sword
will behead you. Christianity has changed its techniques. In the one
hand the Bible, in the other bread and butter. A little bit nicer, but
the inner game is the same.</p><p>In India, I tried to find out whether any rich person has ever been
converted to Christianity: I could not find a single case. Those who are
converted to Christianity are orphans, beggars, poor people, starving
people. Now, naturally the catholic pope and his bishops and the whole
army of their priests would like that abortion should not be legal,
because if it becomes legal, Catholics will be less in number -- where
are they going to find orphans. Birth control should not be allowed, it
is against God; population should be allowed to grow as people become
more and more poor. And that means more customers for Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: MANY PEOPLE BECOME RELIGIOUS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO
DO WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY NEED A CHURCH TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM. AND
IF THAT IS TRUE, HOW COULD THESE RELIGIONS EVER BE ABOLISHED WHEN IT IS
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THEM?</p><p>A: In fact, this is a very vicious circle. Religions teach every
child as the child is born, immediately religions catch hold if it --
either Hindu or Mohammedan or Christian. And they start making him feel
that he is not capable of deciding for himself, that he has to depend on
those who know. That he has to listen to the parents, that he has to
listen to teachers, that he has to listen to the priest. They make
children slowly dependent, and those children lose their sense of
strength, their being, and then naturally they want on everything to be
advised and commanded, to be ordered. They can function only if they are
ordered. If they are nit ordered, they are in confusion. They are always
in search of a father figure. It is not strange that they call the
Christian priest father: It is not strange that God is called the
father. There is simple psychology behind it. They need a father figure;
but I am saying it is a vicious circle. Religions create it and then
they say people need guidance. Nobody needs guidance. I have people here
-- five thousand people are here, one million sannyasins are around the
earth -- none if them needs any guidance. None of them is dependent on
anybody else. If one million people can depend on themselves and take
the sole responsibility for themselves, because I am not their father --
I as not even their uncle! And I Am not their leader; because I cannot
humiliate a person by forcing him to follow me. I am just a friend, not
more than that. I can talk to these people. It is up to them to decide
for or against. I am not asking them to believe in me. And all the
religions have done that; that's why they are called faiths. I am
against faith. My whole approach is unless you know it, never believe
anything. And the beauty us that when you know, there is no need to
believe -- you know it. Belief is always for the ignorant. Faith is
always for those who are not courageous enough to enquire. I teach
doubt; I teach skepticism; I teach enquiry. And a person has to remain
in the state of not knowing until he comes to know. Belief covers his
ignorance. You do not know about God, you do not know about what happens
after death. Naturally, you start believing in somebody who pretends to
know.</p><p>Neither your popes know about it; nor Jesus Christ knew about it.
Even on the cross, he shouted toward the sky: "God have You forsaken
me?" He was a believer -- just illiterate, uneducated. And the people
who were following him were also of the same grade, third rate. Those
third-rate people became apostles of Christianity -- carpenters,
woodcutters, fishermen. Not a single rabbi was a follower of Jesus
Christ, and the whole Judea was full of learned rabbis. What does it
show? It simply show that Jesus appeal is only for the very ignorant,
and those ignorant people want to cover their ignorance, they are ready
to believe. You will find totally different kind of people around me.
You will not find ignorant people, you will not find illiterate people;
you will find people who are almost all graduates from universities,
have master's degrees, have Ph. D.s, D.Litts. Most of them are highly
qualified professionals: psychologists, professors, doctors. You cannot
enforce these people to believe. They have come to me because everywhere
they are being indoctrinated and their intelligence was in rebellion.
Here they have found a place where no indoctrination is happening. I
don't have any doctrine to teach; I don't have any program to give. I
only deprogram people and leave them to themselves. Now find you way, be
courageous and go into the unknown.</p><p>Q: HERE IN RAJNEESHPURAM THEY'VE MADE THE DESERT FLOWER. THERE ARE
SOME PARALLELS WITH THE MORMONS SETTLING IN UTAH, THE JEWS IN ISRAEL;
AND THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY SEPARATES ORGANIZED RELIGIONS FROM CULTS,
IS JUST TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT. DO YOU SEE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE
RAJNEESHEES AND...?</p><p>A: No! How many Rolls Royces do the Mormons have? (Laughter) In a
five thousand member community we have ninety Rolls Royces, hundreds of
other cars, one hundred buses, five planes, the city centrally
air-conditioned. Why these people can...?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WELL, YOU HAVE ROLLS ROYCES, THEY HAD WIVES.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They cannot have many more wives that we can have. We can defeat
anybody. And just look at my commune women. You will not find more juicy
women anywhere else. They are just gorgeous!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE PRECAUTIONS THE COMMUNE HAS TAKEN AGAINST AIDS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE FOREMOST EFFORTS WORLD-WIDE TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. HOW DID YOU
FIRST BECOME AWARE OF IT AND RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THAT
ILLNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have a medical center here. We have the best doctors possible --
from all over the world, not only from Oregon -- we have FRCS from
England, and they are</p><p>continuously watching about everything, so that our commune can be
protected from any kind of attack. And AIDS is going to be the most
tremendous disease that man has ever seen. So it is their research on
it, and if they feel there is something I should know they inform
me.</p><p>And soon we are going to do something about it. We will be the first
in the whole world to do something; right now what is being done is that
every government is trying to suppress the information about it, because
no government want the world to know how many AIDS patients they have.
The Oregon government has made such a test that ninety percent of AIDS
patients will pass through it. This is simply criminal, because those
ninety people that you have passed and cleared will be spreading the
disease; and the disease is such that even by kissing you can give it to
another person. It is not necessary that you should make some sexual
contact -- just by kissing. Saliva is the carrier. I have told my people
to stop kissing, instead of it, rubbing your noses against each other
and enjoy it. And, in fact, these are people -- Eskimos do it already.
They are five thousand years backwards, but as far as AIDS is concerned,
they are far more superior than us. It is not that they don't know about
kissing -- they have seen missionaries kissing, and they laugh at it
that what kind of dirty people are these? Because kissing is simply
laughed at. They have their ways -- and man is no inventive -- they rub
noses, they rub each others' ear lobes. And these are all erotic points,
and the women is so erotic her whole body is erotic. There is no need to
put her in danger. In India, you will be surprised to know that the
ordinary posture of making love -- man on top of woman -- is known as
"missionary posture," because it was the first Christian missionaries
who were seen in that posture. Otherwise in India it was insulting. A
woman who is softer, more fragile, and a huge animal is doing push ups
on the poor woman.</p><p>Q: THERE WERE THOSE CHARGES FILED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO REGARDING YOUR
CHILDREARING TACTICS HERE IN THE COMMUNE. COULD YOU JUST BRIEFLY DEAL
WITH THAT ISSUE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is absolutely wrong, and the court has completely cleaned us.
The charges were invalid. And now we are going to sue the woman who had
put the case for child abuse. She has never been here; she know nothing
about what is happening here to the children -- and she puts a case
against us. And now she is defeated. This is insulting and disgusting.
There is no abuse. Our children are the ones who cannot be abused. In
the outside world, children can be abused, are abused. Here it is
impossible because we are giving them all the information about sex --
not in a roundabout way. We are giving them actual facts -- that these
are the facts of sex and these are the effects of sex, and until you are
sexually mature don't get involved in any relationship which will
destroy your whole life, may make you retarded, may make you perverted.
And when you are of age, the medical center provides every
contraceptive, pills. We don't prevent</p><p>them, but first let them be ready. If a boy is fourteen and has the
energy now to make love -- he has the greatest power to make love
between fourteen and twenty-one, and that is the time which is wasted in
universities. After that, he is on decline. By the time he gets married
after his Ph. D, he will be twenty-eight, twenty-seven; he has already
declined. By thirty-five he is becoming older, he loses interest, he
make love but he is a spent cartridge.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I PEERED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND WATCHED AS YOUR CAR ARRIVED, AND
YOU DANCED WITH YOUR SANNYASINS. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES, WHAT DO
YOU SEE ON THEIR FACES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just love and nothing else. Great love and great gratitude. I
don't think anybody has been loved so much as I have been loved. Jesus
has only twelve disciples -- I have one million; and out of one million,
ninety percent are women. So it is really groovey.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Death it not the end of life, it is the culmination of life. It is
one of the most beautiful experiences. If you have really loved then
only will you experience the beauty of death; if you missed life itself
in listening to the sermons in the churches, in reading the Bible, and
all kinds of nonsense... if you have missed life itself, you will die in
a coma. Before death comes you will become unconscious, so you will miss
the experience of death. The people who are living consciously -- and
that is my basic teaching, live consciously every moment. Even while
making love, remain conscious and a witness. It is a life... long growth
if becoming alert. Then you can die consciously and you can experience
death as the ultimate orgasm. It is far bigger than any sexual orgasm.
In fact, the difference is not only of quantity, the difference is of
quality. It is immeasurable. Living moment to moment, one learns how to
die. beautifully, silently, joyously. One is going on another adventure.
Unknown -- I don't give them any ideas what is going to happen after
death, because that is absolutely wrong, destroying. it is like if I
loved a movie and I tell you the whole story of the movie, and then tell
you that I have brought a ticket for you, go and see. I have destroyed
it already; what is the point of seeing it? I give them the ticket, but
I don't tell them what is going to happen. That they have to discover on
their own. It is tremendously beautiful because I have lived before and
I have died before, and I have died consciously so I know what beauty it
is. It is not the end; it is always a new beginning.</p><p>In existence nothing dies -- it cannot. You cannot destroy even a
small pebble. You can grind it, but it will be there. Now in powder
form. You can throw the powder into the ocean. It will be there, resting
somewhere in the bottom of the ocean, but now it is an accepted
scientific truth that nothing can be destroyed,</p><p>you can only change its form. And if this is so about matter, what to
say about consciousness? -- Which is the highest evolution on the earth.
Existence cannot be so stupid, so unintelligent to destroy consciousness
-- it does not destroy even stones, how it can destroy your soul? But I
don't say to anybody believe in me. I say experiment; and right now you
are alive, so don't bother about death. When it comes, it comes. Right
now you experiment with life, and be ready: death can come any moment.
And particularly in these days where politicians are preparing to
destroy the whole humanity, and religions have contributed their
contribution through AIDS. That will destroy if politicians cannot, then
AIDS will destroy humanity. So we are really living without any
tomorrow. Always man has lived without tomorrow, but never with such a
crisis. And I say AIDS is a religious disease because its beginning is
in homosexuality, and homosexuality was born in monasteries of religions
because there they segregated men and women and they did not allow men
and women to meet. No women can enter in a monastery where only men
live; neither men can go into the nunnery. You are creating the
situation for homosexuality. Religions have been teaching for celibacy
-- which creates perversions because it is unnatural. It is just as if
somebody says to you that unless you stop urinating you will not enter
into the kingdom of God. That is just nonsense! But you can find a few
idiots who will start making an effort, because if this is the price,
they are ready to do it. But what they will do -- they will pretend,
they will be hypocrites, and they will find perverted ways from the back
door. You cannot go against nature: celibacy is against nature. And all
the religions have been preaching celibacy. They are responsible for
AIDS. So today the situation is really more dangerous than it has ever
been. Tomorrow is more uncertain than it has ever been. So live today
with intensity, with totality, with as much consciousness as possible.
And I have here one hundred and twelve methods how to increase your
consciousness. So if death comes tomorrow, there is no problem -- there
will be only my people dying joyously with a smile on their face.</p><p>Q: AT YOUR NEWS CONFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU INVITED SOMEONE TO
ASSASSINATE YOU. IS IT A JOKE? IS IT FEAR OF DEATH BY NATURAL CAUSES, OR
IS IT JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL WAY YOU COULD SEE THE END OF
YOUR LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Most probably, that will be the logical end of my life. It is a
serious joke. And I would prefer it that way, rather than dying on the
bed. Ninety-nine percent of people do that. I don't want to belong to
that crowd! I would rather like to be assassinated than to die on my
bed. And to me there is no problem. I have experienced life. I have
tasted all its joys. There is nothing that I have missed. If death come
this moment, I will not ask even one more moment to complete my
sentence. It is perfectly Okay. In existence, nothing is ever completed.
Only in novels, stories begin and end. In life there is no beginning and
there is no end.</p><p>Abruptly things start and abruptly things finish. There is no
preface, there is no appendix, there are no footnotes, nothing. It is
always in the middle that the story begins. When I used to read -- for
five years I have not been reading anything -- but I loved reading so
much that I have to find out ways to make the book more interesting. I
would begin in the middle, then go to the end, then come to the
beginning. And that was more hilarious, gave more suspense. Life is
really hilarious. Just you have to know how to love it. We don't have
any God, we don't have any heaven and hell. We have only this moment, so
we can pour all our energies into it. And we are doing that. We are
celebrating and enjoying and loving and laughing and dancing. In fact,
that is what creates hostility toward me. The poor is hostile toward the
rich; the sad people are hostile towards those who can laugh and love
and dance. The whole world lives in such misery and suffering that they
cannot tolerate me. My existence and my people's existence proves them
wrong -- and I am not a person just to argue. I give existential
argument: my commune is an existential argument to the whole world that
you also could have loved and danced and sung and enjoyed, but you have
chosen wrong paths, so you go to church, you go to the synagogue. My
people don't go there. There is no need for them to anywhere. They don't
pray. They are not beggars. And to whom to pray? There is nobody in the
sky to pray to. My people meditate. They sit silently doing nothing,
they enter into their own silence, enjoy it. The more you enjoy it the
deeper and deeper you enter into it. There come a point where you are
exactly at your center of being. And that's what I call enlightenment: a
great explosion of luminosity, clarity. All questions disappearing, all
doubts dissolved, you have found the answer. The answer is within you --
nobody can supply it. And all these prophets and messiahs have been
doing just that: they are suppling you the answer. And borrowed answer
is not going to help. Those borrowed answers have made the whole
humanity miserable. They have taken their enquiry, they have taken
everything away from the people and left them utterly poor. My people
are multidimensionally rich.</p><p>Q:SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU DIE, WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE RAJNEESHEES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They will celebrate my death.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THEN GO TO THE FOUR WINDS, OR STAY TOGETHER...?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is for them to decide what to do. I am not to decide.
Remember, that is the strategy of a politician: he want to even control
people after his death. The religious leaders declare their successors,
but what is the point in it? The point is dead over-ruling the living...
When I am gone, I am gone. And it is a double thing to be understood:
when I am gone, I am gone to you -- you are gone to me. I will be doing
whatsoever I want to do; you should do whatsoever you want to</p><p>do. Nobody has to control. You cannot control me when I am dead. You
cannot tell me what I should do after death. Neither will I say to
anybody. I have made you love life, relish every moment. You know the
secret. You will not miss me; you don't need any successor. You are my
successor -- everyone individually. If you still decide to remain
together -- good; if you want to go separate on your own ways, that is
even better. But I am not going to dominate you, either alive or dead.
To dominate anybody in any way is criminal.</p><p>Q: WHAT WILL RAJNEESHPURAM LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS? OR WHAT DO YOU
WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nothing -- I never think about the future. Future is not my
concern at all. To me, time is only now, and space is only here: beyond
that I have no concern. While I am here, I love my people making a
desert into an oasis. When I am gone, these people will be here. These
are intelligent people, they don't need any instructions. Even now I am
not giving them any instructions. They can understand. They know that I
love greenery, so they started planting as manu trees possible. They
know I love water, so they have made dams, lakes. They love me -- from
my shoes up to my hat they make everything for me. I never think about
the future. That's why my life is without any tensions -- I never think
about the past, so I am not burdened with the past. I never imagine
about the future, so I'm not worried about the future. And today is
enough unto itself. I enjoy it. When I go to bed, I thank the whole
existence that it has been beautiful today, and if by chance I wake up
again, we will see.</p><p>Q: YOU MADE THE COMMENT THAT THERE CAN NEVER BE PEACE BETWEEN
OREGONIANS AND RAJNEESHEES. WHY IS THAT? DO YOU NOT WANT PEACE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I always love peace, but what I had said actually has been
misunderstood and it was bound to be because the question was asked, it
was not about peace, it was about coexistence. And I said: "Never."
Because coexistence is an ugly word, political; it means you are you are
an enemy, I am hostile, I am an enemy, but what to do -- we have to
live. I am here, you are here, and we have to live somehow, so some
compromise is needed. That is coexistence. I don't believe in
coexistence. Either I will turn Oregon red, or they are free to turn us
into Oregonians. That is peace, not coexistence: One existence. Till
that happens, the fight will continue.</p><p>Q: WHAT IF OREGONIANS DECIDED JUST TO LEAVE RAJNEESHEES ALONE?</p><p>A: I don't think everybody can leave Rajneeshees to live alone we
won't allow that!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE MOST OPEN WOUND IN THE STATE WAS WHEN THE RAJNEESHEES WON THE
ELECTION IN WHAT WAS THEN ANTELOPE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS LEGAL, PEOPLE FELT
IT WAS A TAKE-OVER. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE RAJNEESHEES WOULD EVER PULL
OUT OF THE CITY OF RAJNEESH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no way, because they are absolutely wrong and we cannot
compromise with anything wrong. It is simple democratic process that
sannyasins are the majority, and whoever is the majority will rule. If
they want to rule, they should create a majority and they can have the
rule. There is not problem in it. And one should not be so ugly in
behaviour that you don't want to be ruled by the majority, and the
minority wants to rule the majority. It is not a take-over. Otherwise,
Ronald Reagan has taken over America. If majority supports, then that's
a democratic process. And it is not a small majority. There are not more
than one dozen people in the dead Antelope, and there are hundreds of
sannyasins there. They can bring more people if they want; otherwise, we
are going to bring more people.</p><p>Q: WILL YOU AND RAJNEESHEES GET INVOLVED IN THE OREGON POLITICAL
SYSTEM YOU SO DESPISE, RUN FOR OFFICE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There is no political problem for us, and we are not involved
in any way with the politics. The sannyasins who are living in Antelope,
they were being tortured by the minority. For small legal things that
they wanted, they were not allowed. The minority should have thought
about it -- it was such a simple thing</p><p>-- that they were denying the majority things which they legally
asked. They are not asking any illegal thing. If they want to make a
house, permit will not be given; if they want to purchase a land, permit
will not be given. On what grounds? Their children will not be admitted
in the school. On what ground? A minority torturing a majority -- that
is democracy? And since we have come there, nobody can complain that we
have harassed any Oregonian? We invited them they gave taken their
children out of school. And still you think that there should be some
peace! And many of them have already left; and the others who are still
hanging are hanging because there is nobody else except us to purchase
their properties, so they can leave. If they cannot be with us, there is
no reason for them to be there; but we are going to be there.</p><p>Q: CAN WE EXPECT PEOPLE IN RAJNEESHPURAM TO BE RUNNING FOR THE STATE
HOUSE OR THE STATE SENATE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS?</p><p>A: No. We are not interested in politics. Our interests are our own
comforts -- our houses, our lands -- we wanted more lands, we wanted
more houses. Our interest was not politics at all; nobody is running for
Assembly... You have many idiots to do that in the State, you need
not...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE RECEIVED SO MUCH OPPOSITION FROM THE POLITICAL ARENA THAT
YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE BEATEN THEN AT THEIR OWN GAME BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. But if sometimes the need arises, we will do everything to
beat them on their own grounds. But we are a small minority, and the
majority of millions of people in Oregon is threatened by us -- this is
something ridiculous. We should be threatened by them, we are not; they
are threatened by us which is simply absurd. That's why I say I have
known people from all the countries of the world, but Oregon seems to be
special. It seems all the idiots of the world go on being born in
Oregon. Strange! For example, they are unnecessarily harassing us.
That's what they did in Antelope. If they had not harassed our people,
we were not interested in making a mayor or a council. Why we should
bother about all that? We are not interested in power or prestige. In
fact, it was so difficult for our people to persuade somebody to be
mayor, to persuade somebody to be the councillor -- nobody wants. Who
wants to get that sort of job? There are so many groovy things going
around, and the poor mayor is sitting in the town hall having a meeting
about unnecessary things... We are not interested, but if they harass us
too much, we can do anything. We will fight in every possible way. We do
not want to harass anybody and we do not want to be harassed by anybody.
We are harmless people, we will not do any harm to anybody; but if
somebody does harm to us, then we are not Christians -- we are not going
to follow Jesus Christ that when somebody hits on you cheek, give him
the other cheek. To me that is insulting the other person who as hit
you. It is making him subhuman. You are becoming holier than thou. No.
We are just human being and we respect you. If you hit me on one cheek,
I will hit you your both cheeks immediately. I just respect you as a
human being. You needed it, you deserved it, you earned it. There is a
story in Buddha's life. He said in one sermon that you should forgive a
person seven times. One of his disciples stood up and asked, what about
the eighth time?</p><p>Reasonable question. Buddha was at a loss for a moment. He had never
expected that somebody would ask about the eighth time, so he said, OK,
Make it seventy- seven. But the man stood up again and he said it makes
no difference. What about the seventy-eighth time? I have heard one
story of a Christian saint who was hit on one of his cheeks. Obviously,
being a follower of Jesus, he gave his other cheek, but the man was also
some man of guts -- he hit on the other cheek even more forcibly. And at
that moment the saint jumped on the man, clutched his neck and told that
now I am going to kill you. But the man said wait, you a</p><p>saint and your master has said that give the other cheek. He said:
OK, I followed the master, I gave you the other cheek, but now I have no
other cheek. Now I am free. And I will teach you a lesson. If they go on
harassing us, we enjoy it, so there is nothing serious in it; but we
will harass them in our own way.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No we don't need. We don't need; it is far better to harass the
governor than to put our governor and then that governor is being
harassed by Oregonians. No. We will do this way; Let the governor be
theirs, we will harass him. And we are enjoying the whole game. If they
can understand a little sense of humor, all the clouds can disappear
within a second. From our side there is no problem at all. Ok? Good</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-29>The Last Testament, Vol 1

POOR COUNTRY. SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING MISERY. THERE IS
NO FOOD, NO HOUSING, NO EDUCATION. BUT THEY HAVE THREE HOPES: TO WIN AT
THE LOTTERY, TO BE SAVED BY GOD, OR TO MAKE A POLITICAL REVOLUTION.</p><p>THERE IS A VERY POPULAR EXPRESSION IN BRAZIL WHICH SAYS, "GOD IS
BRAZILIAN." DO YOU THINK SO?</p><p>ANSWER:* God must be Brazilian, but it is very unfortunate, because
only poor people, suffering people need a God.</p><p>God is just opium. You can take the opium and forget your suffering
your misery, your poverty. So, the more a country is poor, more it sill
be addicted with God. It is the same proportion always. So the more a
country is poor, the more it will be addicted to God. It is the same
proportion always. More the country is happy, contented, comfortable,
who bothers about God? For what?</p><p>Even in the ordinary life of a man, one remembers God only when he is
in misery, suffering, trouble, sick, bankrupt. When everything is going
great, nobody remembers God; there is no need. God is the need of the
suffering, downtrodden.</p><p>So perhaps, if you say seventy percent of Brazilians are without
food, without houses, then God must be a Brazilian.</p><p>God is the property of the poor, the hope of those who are living a
hopeless life. And they will continue to live in poverty until they get
rid of this God. So tell the Brazilians he is a Brazilian, so it is our
duty to finish him.</p><p>Once God is finished from the world, man need not suffer, for the
simple reason, then we start functioning intelligently.</p><p>There is no need for poverty, there is no need for misery, there is
no need for so much sickness. There is no need for man only to live
seventy years. These are just because we have not tried intelligence in
living. Wherever we have tried it, we have reached heights of immense
dimensions.</p><p>Only as far as man is concerned, we are dependent on God.</p><p>It is only three hundred years since science came into being. It
revolted against the world and all kinds of superstitions. And within
three hundred years science has given man so much that in thirty
thousand years, religions have not been able to provide. And this too,
against the priests, against the politicians, science has contributed.
If politicians and priests are not there, man can take a quantum
leap.</p><p>There is no barrier between man and paradise. But the priest wants
people to be poor, because only the poor need him. It is a simple
business ideology. The politician wants people poor, because only the
poor can be conditioned. They are illiterate, uneducated, and they are
so much in suffering that any hope and they are ready to buy it. It may
be God, it may be communism, it may be revolution -- something in the
future, faraway. The poor are ready to buy it.</p><p>The politicians have been selling hope for thousands of years. The
priests have been selling hope, and it is really strange that after such
a long time they are still doing good business. And man seems to be fast
asleep, without looking at the whole strategy.</p><p>The priests and the politicians have to disappear from the earth.
Only then the new man -- rich, comfortable, skillful, creative -- can
come into being.</p><p>So it is Brazilians' duty to kill God. He must be there.</p><p>It is the duty of the poor people of the world to kill God. The rich
people would like him to survive. For the rich people God is a beautiful
investment, because God creates a buffer between the rich and the poor.
And because of that buffer the rich are protected. Remove the buffer and
the rich and all their exploitation will be exposed. And then no priest
can go on befooling the poor in the name of God, in the name of fate, in
the name of the law of action, past lives. All kinds of things have been
invented just to keep the poor poor, ready to be sucked by all kinds of
parasites.</p><p>And the poor man has lived in poverty for so long that he has become
accustomed to it. He accepts it as his life. He does not know what life
is, so he cannot think that he is missing something. To miss something,
first you have to have it.</p><p>And that's the function of my communes. In every country I want my
communes to live as richly, abundantly, contented, joyously, without
God, without heaven, without hell, without politicians, with out
priests, and prove to the world that people can live without all this
nonsense! And they are living far more beautifully than anybody
else.</p><p>Nobody on the earth is singing a song of joy. Nobody on the earth is
in a state to dance.</p><p>We have to create these oases in the whole desert of the earth, so
people at least can see the possibility. They can also be part of this
ecstasy, this pilgrimage.</p><p>First, they will be hostile, because it hurts the ego to see that
others have attained, and you have failed. So the first reaction is that
the others are pretending. Their laughter is just a makeup. Their joy,
their dance is just show-business.</p><p>But how long can you befool yourself by finding such
explanations?</p><p>People cannot go on working for twelve hours, fourteen hours a day,
and still be able to laugh, enjoy, dance, love. Sooner or later the
outside people are bound to be attracted to our communes.</p><p>Our communes have to become finally, a kind of university where we
teach -- not three r's, but three l's: love, life, laughter.</p><p>And there is no other hope for the poor. Revolution has failed.</p><p>In Russia, the politicians were giving them the hope that after the
revolution everything will be paradise. Sixty years have passed, there
is no sign of any paradise. Of course, one thing has happened: they have
distributed poverty equally. And they don't allow Russian people to come
in contact with the rich countries, for the simple fear that if they can
see how richly, intensely and totally people are living, then this
communism has failed. It could not make them rich, it has only made them
all poor -- equally poor.</p><p>So equality has been achieved. The classes have not disappeared.
Their names have changed. It was the bourgeois class and the proletariat
-- the poor and the rich. Now it is the ordinary citizen and the member
of the communist party.</p><p>The member of the communist party has more power than any rich man
ever had, is using all luxuries for himself that any rich man ever had,
is living comfortably with all technological devices at his hand. And it
is only in Russia, that to become a member of the communist party is the
most difficult. In any other country, you can just become the member if
you want -- any moment. No qualifications, no conditions have to be
fulfilled.</p><p>But in Russia, to become a member of the communist party is a long
process, a long discipline -- far longer than a poor man has to travel
to become rich. The distance between the hierarchy that is in power and
the people is bigger in Russia than anywhere else, for the simple
reason, that the middle class has completely disappeared and it has left
a big gap.</p><p>In other societies, the society is divided, not only in two classes
-- about that Marx is absolutely wrong. Society is divided into many
steps. Those two may be the extreme steps -- the poorest and the
richest, but there are in between both, many classes. So there is a
link.</p><p>And the middle class is the biggest class, because on one hand it
joins the poor, on the other hand it joins the superrich.</p><p>In Russia the middle class has disappeared, because the rich are no
more there. So the rich and the middle class both have been reduced to
the proletariat. Poverty is so equal that you don't feel hurt, you don't
feel jealous. There is nothing to feel jealous of, everybody is just
like you.</p><p>God has failed. Marx has failed. And I don't give any hope. Naturally
I cannot fail. They were all giving hope, they could not fulfill the
hopes. I am not giving you any hope. On the contrary, I am taking away
all your hopes, all your future, so that you can live in this moment.
Even if you have not much to live, still one can make this moment a
paradise by small things.</p><p>And if the whole humanity is convinced that this is the only moment
to live, the misers will disappear on their own accord -- because they
are not living, they are accumulating for the future. The monks and the
nuns will disappear, because they are not living in the moment; they are
living for some heaven, some paradise somewhere.</p><p>So the basic thing today is, that God -- which is another name of
hope, revolution</p><p>-- which is a materialistic name for God... But they function exactly
the same. Their function is to keep people intoxicated.</p><p>My work is to wake people and stop taking all these opiums.</p><p>If people are just a little bit awakened, we can disperse all
nations, all nuclear weapons, all atomic plants -- which are simply
wasting energy. And the same energy can become creative and make people
as rich as no Alexander the Great was ever rich.</p><p>The clothes that I am wearing, no emperor in the past could have used
them. And I am a poor man! It was simply impossible, because the
technology was not there.</p><p>We can make the whole earth full of emperors living better than
Ashoka, Akbara, Alexander, Napoleon -- in every possible way.</p><p>I don't see any problem, except the mind of the poor itself -- which
is so conditioned that it still goes on believing in God, who has never
answered any prayer, who goes on believing in paradise. If God was so
compassionate, he would have given you paradise here. Why after death?
Why not before death?</p><p>And the poor people have to see the fact that all the revolutions
have failed. The French Revolution failed, the Russian Revolution
failed, the Chinese Revolution failed. They were bound to fail, because
the revolutionaries who were going to take over the power will become
the power elite, and the society will be still divided.</p><p>And these power elites will be more dangerous than the rich people of
the old. For the simple reason, in countries like Russia and China, you
cannot create another revolution, because the revolutionaries who have
taken over the power know how it has been taken over, so they have
prevented all possibilities. Even to talk about revolution is enough to
be persecuted, killed, or exiled into Siberia. Even if Karl Marx,
Friedrich Engels, or Lenin himself, were to be born into Russia, there
is no possibility that their books would be published. Only government
has the publication department. Anything that is published is published
by the government, approved by the communist party.</p><p>And Marx would not have been allowed to sit in the British Museum the
whole day doing nothing but reading and taking notes. His whole life he
never did anything, except reading and writing. His writings are
voluminous. But in Russia that is not possible. He will not be counted
as a proletariat.</p><p>One of my friends was visiting Russia -- he is a Buddhist bhikku, a
follower of Buddha, a monk.</p><p>He told me, "The first thing that was shocking to the Russians were
my hands."</p><p>I said, "Your hands?"</p><p>He said, "Yes. Whenever I shook hands with them, they immediately
shrank back. And they said, `You must be a bourgeois. Your hands don't
show that you have ever worked."'</p><p>I told the Buddhist monk, "You touch my hand. Then you will know that
you are a proletariat and I am a bourgeois! That will give you great
consolation."</p><p>Marx would not have been possible. No revolution in Russia is
possible. Everything has failed that man has done up to now, for the
simple reason that man does not change his conditioning and goes on
doing things with the same conditioned mind.</p><p>All that is needed is a simple deprogramming. Your mind should be
cleaned from being a Brazilian, from being an American, from being an
Indian, from being a communist, from being a socialist, from being a
Christian, Jew, Hindu -- whatever the name of your limitations. All
those limitations should be dropped, so you can become an unlimited
being.</p><p>That is freedom, and that is true revolution, and it is an individual
affair.</p><p>So take my message to Brazil, "please stop hoping, and start living!
Out of your living there is hope. Out of your hoping there is only death
and nothing else."</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, TODAY, BRAZIL HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF AIDS IN THE
WORLD. DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A MEDICINE AGAINST AIDS? AND
WHY ARE THE GAYS MORE SENSITIVE TO AIDS?</p><p><br></p><p>A:* First, the homosexuals have created the disease AIDS. It is a
homosexual contribution to humanity. Then it can spread to
heterosexuals, but the source of the disease is homosexuality.</p><p>Few things will have to be understood. One, homosexuality is not the
way of nature, not the way of existence.</p><p>Existence always wants the opposite polarities to meet. Then only you
can create a better generation. Homosexuality is uncreative, and
homosexuality is between two men, two women. There is no polarity, there
is no tension, no challenge.</p><p>First, people started becoming homosexuals in monasteries, soldier
camps, school hostels, university hostels -- wherever man was separated
from women. It was going to happen.</p><p>Biology knows nothing about your moralities. By the time a boy is
fourteen, he is capable of giving birth to a child. The same is true
about the girl. But in all the societies, this is the time when their
sex is repressed, and this is also the time when their sex energy is at
its climax -- between fourteen and twenty-one. Nearabout eighteen you
have your peak sexual energy, which you will never have again.</p><p>It seems all societies have conspired that man should not know the
blissfulness of orgasmic experience. This was a beautiful way to divert:
that he has to be</p><p>educated first, he has to go to the university. And by the time he is
back from the university -- he may be twenty-six, twenty-seven,
twenty-eight -- he is already on the decline. He has lost the time when
he could have attained orgasmic experience. Now he can only experience
ejaculation.</p><p>That proves to the religious people that it is sheer wastage of
energy, you don't get anything. And after making love, a man feels
frustrated, nothing comes out of it. He has lost the right timing. The
society has diverted him.</p><p>If we want a more joyous world, the best thing will be that between
fourteen and twenty-one, all girls and all boys are given birth control
methods and total freedom to mix with many boys, with many girls,
because you will never have this energy again. It is lost, then it is
lost forever. Then you will have to wait for next life. That is why
everybody is waiting for the next life, because they have missed
something very essential in this life. They may not be aware of it.
Perhaps they are not aware, but there is a wound inside. Something that
could have blossomed in them has not blossomed. That's why there is so
much despair.</p><p>And then all the religions are teaching celibacy. First, they prevent
the best time to know the secrets and mysteries of sex, and then they
impose the idea of celibacy, that it is very spiritual. It is simply
against nature, against your biology. The monks in the monasteries of
all the religions, have been the first to find homosexuality. And the
disease is basically homosexual, because nature never forgives. You have
to follow the law.</p><p>If you put your hand into the fire, you are going to be burned.</p><p>Nature simply goes on its way. There is no question that you are a
saint, so you will not be burned, you are a celibate so you will not be
burned, only the sinners will be burned -- that is stupidity. Everybody
is going to be burned who puts his hand into the fire.</p><p>The law of nature is impartial, accepts no exception. And anybody who
goes against nature, sooner or later will have to suffer for it.</p><p>Homosexuality was the greatest crime against nature.</p><p>Few things to be understood before you can understand why AIDS
evolved out of it.</p><p>In ancient China, it was a common practice if an emperor was getting
old and his people did not want him to die, the method that was used to
prolong his life was not a medicine. It was two beautiful young girls
who will be lying on both of his sides in the night. And strange as it
may seem, it has worked for thousands of years in China. Finding himself
between two beautiful girls, he again becomes psychologically young. A
great lust for life arises in him. He would like to be young again.
Playing with those girls, there are moments when he forgets that he is
old. And the life of emperors in China has been the longest of any
emperor in the whole world. This was the medicine. @B003</p><p>I mention it so that I can explain what is happening to the
homosexuals. Because they are both men, their energies don't have any
tension, their energies don't</p><p>have any challenge, their energies by and by start losing the will to
live. For what? There is no challenge. They start losing the desire to
live.</p><p>They may not be conscious of it. Just as the Chinese emperors started
feeling a tremendous desire to live more, perhaps forever-life is so
beautiful it is not worth losing great lust arises in them. That lust
gives you energy. That lust provokes all your stagnant forces into
functioning.</p><p>You can see it happen to a man who suddenly falls in love with a
woman and you meet him on the road. You met him yesterday, too, but you
can see the difference. The man is looking radiant. His walk has a dance
in it. He is whistling. And this man used to walk the street as if he
were dragging himself against his will because he has to reach his home.
But today he is not walking, but running. because he has to reach the
home -- the woman will be waiting there.</p><p>Something that was dormant in him has become dynamic. The homosexuals
slowly, slowly go on losing their desire to live. and that is the basic
cause of the disease called AIDS.</p><p>It is not a disease. If it was a disease, there would be a
possibility of finding medicine for it. This is the most strange thing
about it -- it is not a disease. Otherwise, it may take some time, but
we will be able to find some medicine for it. But it is simply loss of
the will to live. Now, what medicine can bring the will back?</p><p>The man really wants deep down to die. He has dropped all hopes to
reach the bank. He is ready to be drowned any moment. He has given
himself a life sentence. He has crucified himself.</p><p>Jesus only said everybody has to carry his cross on his own shoulders
-- I wonder why he forgot that everybody has to crucify himself also.
But people are doing that: carrying their cross on their shoulders, and
then finally putting themselves on the cross.</p><p>Homosexuality has to disappear if we want AIDS to be prevented. All
homosexuals have to be taught again that the woman is something
significant to their life. Her warmth is something significant to keep
them alive.</p><p>Now it is a well-established psychological fact that if a child is
given every nourishment except the warmth of the body, blankets are
given -- he is not kept in cold, he is warm; every food that is needed
for his growth is given -- but there is no human touch anywhere. There
is nobody to hug him, to hold him close to her chest, to her breasts
where he can feel warmth, love.</p><p>They have tried with one child keeping scientifically perfectly
healthy checking that nothing is going wrong, and another child is kept
with the mother -- no check, nobody is bothered whether anything is
going wrong or not. But the first child dies within three months. And
this experiment has been first done on animals many times, and the same
is the result: without the mother's warmth, the feminine warmth, the
child perhaps never gets the will to live.</p><p>That is my explanation for the phenomenon. He never gets, in the very
beginning, a desire to live. This is one side of the case which is now
well established. Homosexuals cannot give to each other the warmth that
they need. They need a feminine warmth.</p><p>Two women cannot give to each other the same quality of energy and
love that a man can give to them. But it has to be understood that AIDS
is not created by lesbians.</p><p>That too is very strange. Homosexuals have created AIDS, not
lesbians. The reason is clear: a woman is always a receiving center, and
man is always an assertive energy. Two women can live together without
disturbing each other's life for the simple reason that they are not
assertive agents. They are completely closed and alone . They can be
together, but they will not affect each other.</p><p>Two men are both assertive. So when homosexuals are making love, they
not are giving energy to each other which is not needed at all -- they
both need feminine energy, feminine warmth.</p><p>So lesbians have no part in contributing Aids. I am sorry to say that
on that point they have not proved equal to men.</p><p>Homosexuality has to disappear from the world, and we can make it
disappear, at least in our communes. It is just a question of
understanding. And, because it is artificial, superficial, it can be
easily removed.</p><p>And precautions should be taken against AIDS because it is already
rampant. This is not the beginning -- we are almost in the middle of it.
The ind is not far away. It spreads like wildfire. And now they have
come to find that even kissing can give it to you.</p><p>Looks as though medical people will not be able to find any medicine
for it. We have to find a way, and we can find a way. My own
understanding is that in our communes slowly, slowly homosexuality
should disappear. About lesbians we can take care later on -- it may not
be giving AIDS, but it is ugly, unnatural. Perhaps someday it may bring
something better than AIDS, nobody knows, because nobody knew about AIDS
before and homosexuality has been in existence since religions have been
in existence.</p><p>It took thousands of years to create the situation in which AIDS can
happen. But to me it is not a disease -- it has nothing to do with
medicine. Medicine and medical care can keep it from spreading, can keep
the man who already has it, alive to the maximum -- that is two years...
if he is completely isolated where no infection is possible.</p><p>That gives the clue to me: the AIDS patient loses all resistance
power. His life energy has shrunk withinwards. The petals of his life
energy are no more open -- they are closed, they are getting ready for
the night. Hence, any infection can enter into his body.</p><p>Because his own will to live is not there, his body will not create
the antibodies to prevent AIDS. In my communes I will suggest: First,
try to help homosexuals turn into heterosexuals. Everybody in the
commune should go to every possible</p><p>test, because we love each other so much that we would not like one
of us to become the cause of the death of so many people. No sannyasin
would like it.</p><p>And we are not going to condemn, because he is simply a victim --
victim of Jesus Christ, victim of Mahavira, victim of Buddha, and those
big criminals are no more there. Otherwise, they should be shot
immediately. Fortunately, they are dead.</p><p>So help them -- these are victims of thousands of years of
homosexuality. Respect them. Be loving to them and compassionate. And
then each commune has to create a corner for them where they can live.
And my idea is that a male AIDS patient should live with a female AIDS
patient.</p><p>Perhaps that may be the only medicine possible. I say perhaps because
it has not been tried, and I am not a man of medicine. I am just crazy,
and crazy ideas come to me. But when nothing is working, why not try a
crazy man's idea?</p><p>All the sane people are saying there is nothing that can be done, so
you are not going to lose anything except a madman's idea. My idea is
that a woman and man -- both having AIDS so there is no question of
giving AIDS to each other, or as much they can give, that is up to them,
there is nothing more to it -- have come to the very end of the
journey.</p><p>But my feeling is that the female energy and male energy meeting
again may provoke the will to live. The warmth of a woman, the love of
the man may postpone the date of their death.</p><p>And this can be done only in my commune with my people, because they
all understand each other. They would like to help each other. Here we
are going to start... soon. And perhaps that may prove the only cure. If
it is out of homosexuality that the disease is born, then something out
of heterosexuality will be the medicine.</p><p>This is my simple logic.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOUR SANNYASINS IN BRAZIL ARE TRYING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO
MAKE SOME BEAUTIFUL SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY COULD LIVE TOGETHER, AND IT'S
ALWAYS DIFFICULT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is difficult?</p><p><br></p><p>Q:YES. MY FEELING IS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE
COUNTRY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE BUSINESS, TO MAKE A COMMUNE.</p><p>A: You talk with Sheela and Savita about that. Some way can be found,
and a commune can be created. Start on a small scale and slowly it can
grow. And few businesses you can do very easily. And we can send you
sannyasins from outside, all around the world to help you. For example,
you can start publications. In Brazil, many of my books are published,
but they are published</p><p>by publishers. Somebody else is taking the profit out of them -- our
sannyasins should publish them themselves. Just that will bring you good
money.</p><p>There is no need to create huge palaces. Just workable houses,
simple. For example, in India where poor people are in millions, in a
village a beautiful hut can be made almost for nothing. This has been a
tradition in Indian villages that whenever somebody is making a house,
the whole village will help. And the houses are made with bamboos -- the
bamboo functions as the wall -- cow dung mixed with mud is put on both
sides of the bamboos, whitewashed it looks so clean, so beautiful. And
just bamboos on the roof with mud tiles. For two hundred rupees, you can
make a beautiful house. Two hundred rupees means, today, five dollars,
or at the most ten dollars.</p><p>Between five to ten dollars, you can make a house. So when the
situation is bad, then think of your local products-whether bamboo is
available, other kinds of wood are available cheap -- and use that
material. There is no need for marbles, and there is no need.… Yes, one
day when you have money then have marble palaces, but meanwhile, till
the palaces come, you need a certain kind of shelter that can be made
very easily.</p><p>Not difficult -- you can create a commune of five hundred people with
small cottages. And you can start businesses. For example, publication
you can start with your own press, your own editors, your own designers.
And you can make it an art -- hand binding, hand stitching.</p><p>And in fact you can sell in the market for a better price than book
printed mass scale in a factory, because that will not have that beauty.
And about other things you talk to Sheela and Savita. There is no
problem which cannot be solved.</p><p>But Brazil needs a commune.</p><p>Q: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT THE THIRD WORLD WAR. WE FEEL
EACH DAY THE WAR COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER. IS THERE SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO
PREVENT THE WAR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The truth is that the nuclear war is never going to happen. Even
when I say it is coming closer and closer, the reason to say it is not
that the war is coming closer and closer, the reason is to awaken you
somehow that the war is coming so close now there is no time to waste --
get up as quickly as possible before the war finishes you.</p><p>But the third world war is impossible for the simple reason that both
the nations America and the Soviet Union are equally balanced with
nuclear weapons. And if a war starts, the whole point of a war is to
win, but in a nuclear war nobody wins. So war has lost its basic
foundation. Why should you fight when both are going to be finished in
it?</p><p>The possibility of one becoming victorious and the other being
defeated is no more there. So I say with nuclear war, war has reached to
such totality that it has committed suicide. Now war is not possible --
I mean nuclear war is not possible.</p><p>Just the other day I saw a petition of American scientists who had
made the first nuclear war plant in America -- the pioneers of nuclear
weapons. Fifty scientists have signed the petition to the president and
to the Supreme Court that we are trembling with fear -- what we have
done. And we have already so much nuclear weapons on both sides that
they are enough to destroy all life from earth within ten minutes.</p><p>Those fifty scientists who have been making nuclear war possible have
visualized the situation that is happening. The same is happening in
Russia -- the scientists are becoming aware that what they are creating
is a mass scale world- wide suicide.</p><p>It is so absurd and meaningless. Those fifty scientists have
mentioned one thing which I have been telling again and again: that up
to now all our efforts to find some antidote for the nuclear weapon has
failed. And we don't think that we will be able to find something that
destroys the power of nuclear weapons -- no counter energy is
available.</p><p>It is because of this fact they have put the petition because now it
is simply destruction -- there is no way of protecting anybody. I am
tremendously happy that nuclear weapons have come to a point where
fighting becomes useless, war becomes utterly stupid. And even if seeing
this stupidity the politicians decide to go for a nuclear war, then I
think this earth deserves it.</p><p>If its leaders are ready to destroy it, then perhaps it is good we
finished. The universe will go on -- it has been going on before this
earth was born, it will go on with the same beauty and with the same
splendor. It doesn't matter that the earth is gone. There are 50,000
planets exactly like this earth in the universe where life exists.</p><p>So if the situation for life to exist on this earth disappears, the
bodies will be dead here and your souls will be transplanted into other
planets. They don't need missiles, they don't need rockets, they can
simply jump a quantum leap from this planet.</p><p>But as far as I am concerned, I am totally convinced that war is
impossible for the simple reason that that's why they have been
postponing it. And they will go on postponing it -- they want to find
something, either party -- whoever finds it first will immediately go
for nuclear war because he can protect his country and you cannot
protect your country. Then war again gains meaning -- somebody will be
victorious and somebody will be defeated.</p><p>But I don't see there is any way to find an antidote. For the simple
reason that 300 years of continuous creation of war mechanisms,
destructive weapons, has led to the nuclear weapon. You have never
worked for life, you have never thought about how to create more
beautiful life-healthier, intelligent, lengthier. If side by side you
were working for these 300 years, putting your whole energy as you have
been putting into war, perhaps you may be able to find an antidote --
but there is not time enough.</p><p>If all the scientists of the world together start working now,
perhaps in one hundred years they may be able to find a clue which
nullifies all nuclear weapons. That seems to be impossible.</p><p>So to me the third world war is over. We have passed it -- now think
about the fourth. And prepare for the fourth. Third is not possible.</p><p>And I am not a pacifist, and I don't want my sannyasins to be
pacifists. A pacifist is against war; so much so that if he had nuclear
weapons he will fight with nuclear weapons against war. A pacifist is
not a peaceful man.</p><p>Our sannyasins are not pacifists, but peace loving, silence loving,
trying to find their inner serenity. If we can create around the world
millions of people who are centered in their meditation, who know who
they are, who know the tremendous bliss that comes when you enter into
your innermost core, that will create a energy blanket around the earth.
That is the only possibility to prevent.</p><p>So directly I am not concerned with war. My concern is how to create
more peaceful people, more loving people, more meditative people.
Because if the balance for peace-loving people is more in the world,
then any war can be prevented.</p><p>If there are millions of meditators in the world, nobody can force
them to go war, to go destroy innocent people. In fact, these people who
have attained some light within themselves will become a tremendous
barrier -- not only against nuclear war -- but against any kind of
war.</p><p>I am aware that nuclear war is impossible, and it is possible that
the Soviet Union and America will come to a conclusion to drown all
their nuclear weapons into the Pacific -- I don't know who gave it the
name Pacific. Perhaps for this purpose</p><p>-- and stop all traffic in the Pacific. Although it is five miles
deep, there is always danger anything can trigger, and then it can
become a chain explosion.</p><p>So for at least a decade, no traffic in the Pacific. Drown all the
weapons there. And my feeling is, soon Russia and America will come to
that conclusion. But that does not mean war will not happen. Then old
type of war -- first world war, second world war -- those type of wars
will continue. Thinking of the third world war, they look like
children's play. But they were immensely horrible.</p><p>So as far as I am concerned, third world war is out of the question.
But still other wars will be there.</p><p>If we want to prevent all kinds of war in the world, then we have to
spread the red people to the farthest corner everywhere, so that we have
a commune of millions of young people who declare that they are the
owners of the earth, and they refuse any kind of passport, any visa.</p><p>Movement is our birthright, and the whole earth is ours. If we have
millions of people to destroy the boundaries of nations, the boundaries
of religions, then there is nothing to fight for. Fight with whom?</p><p>So my direct effort is not to prevent war or to be a pacifist and
print pamphlets against war and protest and put posters on the walls and
scream and shout. All that nonsense is not going to prevent. They were
doing the same thing before the</p><p>first world war. They were doing the same thing before the second
world war. They are doing the same thing before the third world war.
They are just useless people. Good intentioned, but unintelligent.</p><p>My effort is to create a vast atmosphere of peace around the earth
and that will be enough. War will become impossible.</p><p>In every country we will have thousands of sannyasins who will
prevent that country itself, because they will say, "First kill us and
then you can kill the neighboring country." They will be sitting on the
boundary line meditating, "Kill us first." On both the sides. On the
other sides also. Back to back.</p><p>And I don't think any politician has the courage to kill millions of
his own people, because then the whole country will destroy the
government and the politicians and everything. Because these children
are not doing anything wrong, and they belong to the whole country.</p><p>So create peaceful people, and if time arrives, we will risk all our
peace-loving people. And I don't think that any country can go to
war.</p><p>It has never happened that the people of the same country are
opposing its own government, that "War is not going to be our game
anymore." And it is happening in both the countries. The enemy camp --
young people are ready there too: "Kill us first and then you can do
whatsoever you want."</p><p>There are a thousand-and-one possibilities to change this world. But
the basic need is to spread more and more sannyasins all over the
world.</p><p>Already the red color is no more associated with communists. We have
taken its possession already, copyright is ours now.</p><p>Even in Russia we have a beautiful group of sannyasins. Just the
other day there was an article against me in a Russian magazine. They
have been persecuting sannyasins. They have been taking their books
away. The sannyasins have done nothing wrong -- no illegal thing, no
crime -- so they cannot do anything to them. In the article they have
published the main prominent sannyasins' names, so that they can be
recognized by the people anywhere, because they don't wear red clothes,
they don't wear a mala. They are my underground sannyasins. They meet
also in the basements of houses, so that they can meditate and nobody
hears. They can listen to the tape, they can read a book.</p><p>And they are more excited than anywhere else, because for sixty years
Russian youth has been missing something which is the very flavor of
youth, something revolutionary, something rebellious. For sixty years,
Soviet youth is the poorest youth in the world.</p><p>From their childhood they simply become adult. The youth -- that
season -- never comes. Those days of dreaming of changing the whole
world, of changing man, of creating a new humanity -- if they are not
there, youth loses all its glamour, its splendor.</p><p>So they are immensely excited. And I know that communist countries
will soon be having thousands of sannyasins -- without any question.</p><p>And nobody else can provide communist countries anything that I am
offering to them.</p><p>They have been taught there is no God. I say, "Perfectly good, there
is no God." They have been told there is no hell, no heaven. Perfectly
true.</p><p>They have been told not to believe -- that's my whole teaching.</p><p>Only on one point... I am giving them something new -- that is
meditation. And Marx or Lenin or Stalin, nobody has said that meditation
is against communism. Just sitting silently, doing nothing... How can it
be against communism? Or against anybody?</p><p>So my sannyasins need not be afraid in communist countries either,
because my teaching agrees with Marx on every point, except meditation.
But that is the whole secret: that meditation will destroy all those
communist ideas, those Marxian concepts. And about meditation, there is
not a single word against it in the whole communist literature, because
they have never even heard about it. Marx knew nothing about it.</p><p>So try to spread meditation far and wide, and find out whatever is
possible in your situation. The country is poor, then manage something.
But communes have to exist. And once a commune is there, soon you will
be able to produce many things, create many things.</p><p>And the commune is not going to remain poor long. And it will become
a prototype for other people, "If we can create and we can live
comfortably and we are not starving, and we are rejoicing, why can't you
just do the same as we are doing."</p><p>Okay.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-1-chapter-30>The Last Testament, Vol 1

published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The
interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH FRED BRUNING OF NEWSDAY, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU STAY WARM IN SUCH A COLD ROOM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: is not cold.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: TO ME IT IS VERY COLD.</p><p><br></p><p>A: To me it is only cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU ALWAYS FELT BETTER IN COLD SURROUNDINGS, EVEN AS A
CHILD?</p><p>A: Always</p><p>Q: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THAT IS ASKED IN MEDITATION: WHO
ARE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is a little bit complicated. It is not an ordinary question.
When you ask "Who am I?" you are not waiting for an answer. There is
nobody to answer you. But by constantly inquiring "Who am I?" slowly,
slowly other thoughts start disappearing. You become more and more
attuned with only one thing -- this quest: "Who am I?" When all thoughts
have disappeared and only the sound "Who am I?" remains, that is the
miracle moment. That sound also disappears. First it kills all your
thoughts, and finally it commits suicide -- not that you get an answer,
but the question disappears. And that is the moment of ultimate
bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW OULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF?</p><p>A: Impossible.</p><p>This question is possible [to ask] only of an object. And I am not an
object; I am subjectivity. I can describe the table, I can describe the
grapes, I can describe the</p><p>whole world -- except me. Description is applicable only to objects.
I am always the witness. If I describe myself -- in the very nature of
things -- that description becomes false, because I am again witnessing
it. I am always the witness, which cannot be reduced to an object.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DESCRIBE OTHERS, OTHER INDIVIDUALS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. As objects of course, but not as a subjectivity. I can
describe the color of your hair, I can describe the clothes you are
wearing, but I cannot describe you, the being that you are -- that
remains indescribable. And that's the whole mystery of existence: that
at the ultimate core, at the very center, is something that you can
experience, but you cannot explain.</p><p>Q: DO YOU EVER HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR WORK, ABOUT YOUR ROLE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no question. For thirty-two years I have not encountered
any doubt in me, any question in me. Yes, before I became enlightened I
had millions of questions, millions of doubts. The moment I came to know
myself, that dark night was over. Now there is no question of doubt, no
question of repenting, no question of planning for the future. Just this
moment is enough -- I am totally contented with it as it is.</p><p>Q: THINGS COULDN'T BE BETTER?</p><p>A: No, not for me. For you, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's why I am saying it. You are not sure; I am sure. Q: MAYBE
YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND?</p><p>A: I can -- that's my whole business. Q: AND YOU ARE GOOD AT IT?</p><p>A: I am just perfect -- not good.</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE FOR ME BEFORE YOU CAN DETERMINE
WHETHER THINGS COULD BE BETTER OR WORSE.</p><p>A: No need for me [to know]. All sleeping people are sleeping people.
It does not matter to me whether this man has a Ph.D. degree and asleep,
this man is a doctor and he is asleep; that man is an engineer and he is
asleep -- that does not matter to me. My problem is simple: they are all
asleep and they will be better off if they are awakened.</p><p>Q: I AM ASLEEP AS WELL.</p><p>A: You are asleep as well.</p><p>People [have been] doing everything in sleep for millions of
years.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM ALSEEP, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED?</p><p>A: As far as I am concerned, yes. Q: IS SHEELA ASLEEP?</p><p>A: Yes -- sound asleep.</p><p>Q: HOW WILL YOU AWAKEN HER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am trying...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE? DO YOU EVER
FEEL 'ENOUGH'?</p><p>A: I have never read any of my books.… I have never heard any of my
tapes. I don't even bother what I said yesterday. And if you ask me
tomorrow about this meeting, I will not be consistent with it at all.
Because I don't carry comparison, memory; I simply go on existing moment
to moment. You get bored because you compare: the same wife every night,
the same kiss, the same geography... It is strange, unless you are
asleep, to remain with one woman for thirty or forty years -- it is just
a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT IS JUST WHAT MY WIFE KEEPS SAYING!</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's good. Somehow help her to come here... All wives who run
come here finally. Because you can run from one husband to another
husband, but finally you have to run from husbands to my place. Here
there is no husband and no</p><p>wife.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS MARITAL FIDELITY WORTH ANYTHING?</p><p>A: Nothing -- just nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DON'T THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOME, NOT GOOD FOR
OTHERS?</p><p>A: No. The very word `fidelity' is ugly, dirty. If I love you, I love
you. If I don't</p><p>love you, I don't love you. I am a simple, sincere, straightforward
man.</p><p>What do you mean by fidelity? Fidelity means: when you don't love,
even then remain faithful. Anything that goes against love is ugly. What
is the need of fidelity? If I love you, is that not enough? You need
some fidelity too? That means there is a doubt in your mind -- you are
afraid: today love is there; tomorrow it may not be. So something legal,
religious -- the church, the court, and some condition of fidelity -- so
when love goes away and the spring is over, you can cling to these
props: fidelity, court, law religion, church. Love needs nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED MARRIAGE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Never considered marriage. Q: DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?</p><p>A: No. How can I have children? Not even my sannyasins have
children.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU SAY: "HOW COULD I HAVE CHILDREN?" OF COURSE YOU COULD
HAVE CHILDREN.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't want my child to be in this world with Ronald Reagan,
Soviet Union, Ethiopia, India. In this starving world, where people are
piling up nuclear weapon to destroy the whole planet... I would not like
my child in this world -- no!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHO DO YOU CONSIDER HISTORY'S MOST ADMIRABLE FIGURES AND MOST
DESPICABLE?</p><p>A: Your whole history is bunk.… I mean the whole human history is
bunk, because it is written by people who were victorious; it is all
false. For example, in India, Britain ruled for three hundred years and
they were the writers of history. And whatsoever they wrote was wrong.
They were not writing about the reality, the fact. To them the Indian
revolution was only a mutiny; it was not revolution. Revolution has
respectability about it; mutiny is something ugly to be crushed.</p><p>The moment India became independent, they rewrote the history -- they
changed those three hundred years. Now, who is right?</p><p>When Stalin came into power in Russia, he changed the whole history
of the revolution -- he even changed pictures. Trotsky was the second
figure to Lenin, so in every picture he was sitting next to Lenin.
Stalin was nobody. He changed the pictures: Trotsky was removed; Stain's
picture was put instead. And all the old books were destroyed. Trotsky
himself had escaped and he was in Mexico, writing history. He was on the
last page, when one of the murderers from Stalin hit him on the head
with a hammer.</p><p>Looking at Trotsky's history -- and he was one of the chief
characters in the history... Lenin was not a very impressive person; he
had no charisma. He was a great organizer...</p><p>Trotsky had charisma, and he had influence over the masses. Both
together were immensely helpful and complementary to each other.</p><p>Q: YOU HAVE READ WIDELY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have read immensely.</p><p>Q: DESPITE THE FLAWS IN HISTORY, WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE ADMIRABLE
INDIVIDUALS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You will not even have heard those names that I consider
admirable. For example, I consider admirable a poet in Japan, Basho, who
has written a few small haikus -- three-line poetries. But each haiku is
a tremendous experience of meditation. No poet in the whole world has
been able to put so much in those few words. But only a meditator can
understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU HAVE EXPRESSED YOURSELF IN THE PAST ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS,
THOUGH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have spoken on many individuals. Q: JESUS FOR INSTANCE?</p><p>A: Yes, I have spoken on Jesus, Moses, Mohammed. I have spoken on
hundreds of people... There are three hundred fifty books that I have
spoken; I have never written anything -- those are all spoken words.</p><p>I have admired one Chinese: Chuang Tzu. He is the most absurd
character in the whole history of man; that is why I admire him.</p><p>Q: WHY DO YOU ADMIRE ABSURDITY?</p><p>A: Because life is absurd. To search for meaning in it is going to be
frustrating. That's why western philosophy has come to a certain
philosophy of existentialism, which talks only of meaninglessness.</p><p>Chuan Tzu says that there is no need to search for meaning. If you
search for meaning, then you will end up in meaninglessness, and that
will be frustrating. Life is an absurdity -- it is a mystery. You need
not search for meaning, you have just to live it, enjoy it. And I agree
with him.</p><p>Q: YOU SEEM TO DELIGHT IN CONTRADICTIONS. I THINK THAT IS PART OF
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, that's what I am saying; I am always contradicting myself
knowingly, so that nobody can make a consistent philosophy out of
me.</p><p>Q: BUT IN THE END, WHAT WILL BE LEFT BUT A SERIES OF
CONTRADICTIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Those contradictions, if you pass through all of them, first will
create confusion in you; second, will create a tremendous silence in
you. If you persist, if you don't escape from the confusion, they will
create a silence in you -- and that silence will be a revelation. So I
am not giving a philosophy to people; I am giving a device for them to
discover the ultimate silence of existence -- which is meaningless, as
meaningless as a roseflower is.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't want to be remembered. Q: BUT YOU WILL BE!</p><p>A: That is other people's problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU WANT SET ON YOUR TOMBSTONE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. Nothing. Once I am gone, I am gone. Then whatsoever my people
want to do, they can do.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE; WHAT DO
YOU DO?</p><p>A: First thing to understand about is that whatever I am doing, I am
not a doer -- I am always a witness. Taking a bath in my bathroom, there
are two persons: one is taking a bath, another is watching. And the
watcher is me. The one who is</p><p>taking a bath soon will be in a grave. So as far as my inner being is
concerned, it is just the same, twenty-four hours. Sleeping, I am
watching; talking to you, I am watching; sitting silently in my room for
hours, I am watching. So as far as my essential being is concerned, I am
only a witness. But the doer is there -- I have to get up in the
morning. But I never get up on my own -- I am a lazy person.</p><p>Q: WHO WAKES YOU?</p><p>A: Somebody takes care of me... she is here: Vivek. She wakes me up
at six o'clock in the morning. And then one and a half hours I enjoy my
bathroom.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: ONE AND A HALF HOURS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: One and a half hours -- that is minimum. Q: WHAT GOES ON?</p><p>Great things...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I SAW THE INTERVIEW ABOUT THE VERY ELEGANT BATHROOM AND YOUR
INVITATION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, I have not only one bathroom -- I have two, because if
something goes wrong with one bathroom, the other is all ready,
emergency ready. I cannot miss anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just some plumbing problem arising...</p><p>Because I cannot miss anything -- I want to take as much out of each
moment as it is possible. I love taking a bath(tub), playing with soap
bubbles. Albert Einstein discovered everything about the universe,
playing with soap bubbles. My one and a half hours is nothing -- he was
sometimes six hours in his bathtub.</p><p>Q: MAYBE HE HAD TROUBLE GETTING OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: His wife had trouble getting him out. But because I won't have any
wife, there is no trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO YOU ARE READY FOR THE DAY AFTER?</p><p>A: Yes. One and a half hours taking my bath, I am taking my shower.
And I have all the best hypo-allergenic soaps, shampoos, conditioners --
I enjoy them immensely.</p><p>Q: AND THEN AFTER... DO YOU DO ANY ROBUST WORK, ANY KIND OF
EXERCISES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just a little exercise in my bathroom. Q: ALSO IN THE
BATHROOM...</p><p>A: My bathroom is big enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND THEN IS THERE A PERIOD OF STUDY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. For five years I have stopped studying anything; not even a
newspaper -- nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD? A: No.</p><p>Q: IF I ASKED YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN NICARAGUA OR EL SALVADOR,
WOULD YOU KNOW?</p><p>A: No -- unless Sheela informs me; that is her duty. She is my
secretary; if she feels that something is happening which needs to be
informed, then she brings it to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IS THERE ANYTHING IN CURRENT HISTORY?</p><p>A: Yes, right now she is bringing every information about AIDS, which
is significant.</p><p>Q: IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN SEPTEMBER YOU WILL INVITE SOME
VICTIMS OF AIDS TO THE COMMUNE FOR CARE. IS THAT TRUE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Perhaps, perhaps. Spread the gossip.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU THINK THE SANNYASINS WOULD RESPOND?</p><p>A: Just the way they are responding -- they will laugh. They will
laugh, because</p><p>my sannyasins don't consider death a calamity; it is a celebration, a
new beginning.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK AIDS REPRESENTS SOME COSMIC PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT'S
GONE WRONG SOMEHOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. There is no punishment in existence and no reward -- each
action has its consequence. It depends on you, what you want to call
it.</p><p>Q: SO AIDS HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE BEYOND ITSELF? IT EXISTS, IT KILLS AND
IT MEANS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's all -- nothing more than that; nothing more in it.
Religions bring the idea of punishment and reward, and through that they
bring heaven and hell and the whole theology: that you are a sinner,
that you are a saint. To me, there are only people -- neither sinners
nor saints. And everybody has to do what he wants to do. If a person
ends up with AIDS it is totally his responsibility; he was doing things
which have brought him to a certain end. And he should be perfectly
happy with it -- nobody has forced him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS: HOMOSEXUALITY AND DRUG
ABUSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't. Each individual's thinking. as far as I am concerned,
anything that is</p><p>unnatural, anything that is not part of the program or your biology,
physiology, is going to lead you into trouble. But you may like the
trouble -- you may love the challenge.</p><p>I am against homosexuality, lesbianism and all kinds of perversions.
But that is my personal opinion. If any individual chooses to be
homosexual, there is no condemnation in me for the person. I am not
going to throw him into hell; I am not going to judge him. That is his
[way]. I have told my opinion; [if] still he feels that homosexuality is
the only thing that is appealing to him, then he has every right to be a
homosexual.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU SEE THAT AS AN UNNATURAL ACT?</p><p>A: Not only see -- I say also say that it is an unnatural act. But
you are free to do something unnatural.</p><p>Q: WHAT FOR YOU IS SEXUAL PERVERSION?</p><p>A: It is a religious disease, sexual perversion.… It is a religious
disease. All the religions of the world are responsible for it because
first they started forcing celibacy on people, which is unnatural.
Unless you are impotent, you cannot be celibate. And the strangest thing
is: not a single impotent person has become enlightened in the whole
history of man.</p><p>That means that all these people -- Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ,
Krishna -- all these people were more sexual than ordinary people. It is
their oversexual energy that does not feel contented with women and
children and the ordinary, mundane world. After all this experience they
are still too full of energy and they want to go on some higher quest.
All these people are oversexual.</p><p>No impotent person has contributed anything to the world, because he
cannot be creative. His basic creative energy, sex energy, is missing.
Telling people to be celibate and then putting monks in one place, in
one monastery and putting nuns into another place, and not allowing men
and women to meet, you are creating the situation for homosexuality. So
Catholics are responsible, Hindus are responsible, Buddhists are
responsible -- they are creating the situation.</p><p>Q: I DON'T THINK CATHOLICS OR BUDDHISTS OR HINDUS ARE ANY MORE LIKELY
TO BE HOMOSEXUALS THAN ANYONE ELSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They have to be. Particularly their monks -- what will they
do?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THAT DOESN'T EFFECT NECESSARILY THE MASSES OF PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That reflects, because those... for example, in India there are
five million Hindu monks. Now these five million Hindu monks are staying
in Hindu families, are coming in contact with Hindu children, women --
all kinds of people. And they are bound to spread their perversion in
every possible way. They will be abusing children for their
sexuality.</p><p>They have been caught: just now, three or four days before, one
Christian priest has been imprisoned for one and a half years because he
was abusing small children.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THESE SEEM ISOLATED INCIDENTS...</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are not isolated. They don't come to your notice -- that is
one thing... because the church wants to repress them, the society wants
to repress them, the government wants to repress them. How many
homosexual senators do you have?</p><p>Q: GOT ME...</p><p>A: No information about your senators.</p><p>Q: YOU SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE ALL...</p><p><br></p><p>A: I know.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU KNOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: One personally I know.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU PERSONALLY KNOW A HOMOSEXUAL UNITED STATES SENATOR?</p><p>A: Yes, yes. Yes. Not only homosexual, perhaps he may have AIDS.</p><p>Q: WHO IS THE PERSON?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Name I cannot tell you -- that's your work to find out. Q: HOW DID
YOU COME UPON THIS INFORMATION?</p><p>A: I will not tell you anything, but one thing I can tell you: that
every vested interest is trying in every way to repress such
information. For example, the pope before this pope was a homosexual --
everyone in Italy knew. He was a bishop in Milan, and he was always
hanging around with a homosexual, and everyone knew. Then he became the
pope and that homosexual man who was hanging around him became his
secretary, came to Vatican.</p><p>Q: WHEN YOU SAY EVERYBODY KNOW, WHO IS EVERYBODY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because you could have asked in Milan to anybody. These are things
which people know, but which will not come to be given as evidence in
the court. These are not easily provable things.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT PEOPLE SAY THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE.</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no problem. No, no -- you can ask me. I am not a pope and
I am not a president and I don't care a bit about any respectability --
you can ask me. And I can put their information. correct. They may not
be well informed. I can inform them about myself perfectly well.</p><p>Q: THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO SPEAK OF.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No -- not a single thing.</p><p>Q: PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE...</p><p><br></p><p>A: Whatever they say, you just tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THEY SAY THAT YOU HAVE DEVELOPED THIS ORGANIZATION FOR YOUR OWN
BENEFIT, THAT YOU ARE A LLIAR, THAT YOU ARE A CHEAT, THAT YOU TREAT
PEOPLE UNFAIRLY, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN COARSE AND UNKIND IN YOUR DEALINGS
WITH OREGON AND OF ANTELOPE FOR VERY PARTICULAR SELFISH REASONS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: So start with one, so I can answer you. For example, I have not
been coarse</p><p>and unfair to Oregonians; I have been very lenient and very liberal.
I should not have been so liberal. And from now onwards I will be coarse
and I will show them what roughness means.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN TOO LIBERAL, TOO LENIENT?</p><p>A: We have just been factual -- calling a spade a spade. But now I am
going to call a spade a fucking spade -- you can go and tell those
Oregonians.</p><p>Q: I THINK PEOPLE FEEL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SOME
TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I have not been doing anything. Go point by point, so I can
put you right.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE POINT WAS THAT THINGS CAN BE SAID ABOUT PUBLIC PEOPLE WITHOUT
THERE BEING ANY TRUTH TO WHAT IS BEING SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. But you don't come across a man like me in your public people
-- you can ask me and I can answer you directly. For example, you cannot
ask your public people; they depend on you, their respectability depends
on you. If a senator says he is a homosexual, perhaps next election he
is gone. But as far as I am concerned, I am not dependent on anybody in
the whole world -- not even your God. So I can simply be true. Only I
can be true -- anybody who is dependent cannot be true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I MIGHT ASK YOU HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK, AND YOU MAY
TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING IN THE BANK. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER THAT IS
TRUE OR NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just listen to me: you can inquire. Has anybody ever seen me with
a single dollar? I don't even have pockets. I don't have even a diary to
keep my accounts.</p><p>I don't have any connection with any bank in the whole world. You can
put your</p><p>F.B.I. or C.B.I. or whatsoever nonsense you have in America -- if
they can find a single bank account of mine, I am ready to be shot. They
should inquire. And I am ready -- if they can find a single paise in my
name anywhere...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR BEING WILLING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DOESN'T SETTLE THE
ARGUMENT.</p><p>A: Nothing settles the argument. Has any argument ever been settled?
Is it settled that Jesus was the son of a virgin girl? For two thousand
years theologians have been arguing, and he was simply a bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS MORE EASILY DEALT WITH THOUGH...</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, this is a simpler case to decide, because a virgin woman
giving birth is a simple matter to decide. My case of bank account will
take a long investigation.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IT COULD BE DETERMINED.</p><p>A: Yes, it can be determined. Q: THE OTHER CANNOT.</p><p>A: The other can also be determined -- I determine it. And no medical
person can refuse me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THAT HAS TO DO WITH MATTERS OF FAITH. WHAT IS YOUR NOTION OF
FAITH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Faith is simply for the ignorant and the idiots; faith is not for
intelligent people. Intelligent people try to know things. Either they
know, or they don't know. If they don't know, they simply accept that
they don't know.</p><p>Q: BUT PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE FAITH IN YOU.</p><p>A: Nobody can say that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO SAY...</p><p><br></p><p>A: Then they are wrong...</p><p>Q: ... WHO SAY THEY TRUST YOU.</p><p>A: ... because I am continuously saying to them that nobody should
have belief in me, nobody should have faith in me. What more can I
do?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IT SEEMS TO ME, THAT MAKES YOU MORE APPEALING TO PEOPEL.</p><p><br></p><p>A: So what do you say: Should I start saying to everybody they should
believe in me, everybody should have faith in me? -- will that convince
you?</p><p>Q: I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOU FOR THIS VERY KIND OF
CONVERSATION.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is people's business, but as far as I am concerned, I can
only do two things: either I can say, "Have faith in me" or I can say
"Don't have faith in me,"or I can remain silent. But in all the cases I
am guilty. Just look at the situation: if I am silent, you can say I am
silent and that is misleading If I say "Don't have faith in me" you say,
"They have faith in You because they love Your idea of not having faith
in You."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: EXACTLY RIGHT, YES. YOU ENCOURAGE QUESTIONING, BUT IS THERE ANY
FORMAT SET UP FOR YOU TO BE QUESTIONED BY THE PEOPLE?</p><p>A: No format is settled. They have to ask their questions. And there
is no need for any format, for the simple reason that I don't come to
you or to my people with any answers ready -- your question creates the
response in me. So if I know, I will tell you. If I don't know, I will
tell you I don't know anything about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: A SANNYASIN MY FEEL THAT PERHAPS THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED
DIFFERENTLY. HOW WOULD THAT PERSON MAKE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT HE HAS
RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have nothing to do with money, and I have nothing to do with how
it is spent.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU NO INFLUENCE IN THE WAY MONEY IS SPENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I have no influence, no information -- that is different
corporations, different corporation heads; they have to settle their own
things.</p><p>Q: I THINK WHEN YOU SAY THAT, PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE SIMPLY DON'T
BELIEVE IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A: That is their business.… By not believing it, it does not mean
that they are right. There is half of the world not believing in God.
All the communists around</p><p>the world don't believe in God. All the Buddhists in the world don't
believe in God. All followers of Jainism don't believe in God. But even
that does not prove that God is not. -- neither it proves [does it
prove] that God is, because half of the world has faith in God. It
simply proves that God is just a bogus word. You can go on arguing about
it for millenia and you will not come to any conclusion, because in the
first place there was nothing to conclude about.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A CAPITALIST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am a super-capitalist -- without a single cent.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU ARE IN A VERY FORTUNATE POSITION.</p><p>A: That's why I am known as the Blessed One. I don't have to bother
about any taxation. I don't have to bother about any bank account. I
don't have to bother to earn, and [know] how to spend -- and still
everything is available to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY YOU HAVE COME INTO SUCH GOOD LUCK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No -- I have simply accepted everything that has come (on) my way.
Good or bad, I have accepted it.</p><p>Q: DID YOU FORESEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS YEARS AGO? A: No.</p><p>Q: WHAT WERE YOUR HOPES THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am a without-hope person.</p><p>Q: NEVER HAD HOPES FOR YOURSELF? NEVER DREAMS AS A YOUNG MAN?</p><p>A: No. Just before twenty-one, I had.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WERE YOUR DREAMS THEN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They were dreams about becoming enlightened, and they were
fulfilled. They were dreams about knowing myself, and they were
fulfilled. And after that,now I have nothing to dream.</p><p>Q: YOUR DREAMS DID NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF MATERIAL ELEMENT IN THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. From the very childhood I was not interested in anything else
than myself.</p><p>Q: THAT'S UNUSUAL.</p><p>A: It is. It is, in such an insane world, to be so sane is...</p><p>Q: HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? IS IT YOUR UPBRINGING, YOUR
PARENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Very difficult to account for it, because my parents were just
ordinary people, as everybody's parents are. They tried their best to
bring me to their religion. But I was rebellious -- I made it clear to
them that `please leave me alone; let me search for myself'.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN DID YOU BEGIN SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT TO YOUR PARENTS AND
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU IN RETURN?</p><p>A: Almost when I was four -- I started small. About small things --
it is not only about big spiritual things -- about small things. For
example, if my father would say, "You just get out of the room -- don't
disturb me." Then there was no way. I would simply refuse and say, "You
can go out if you are disturbed. I am not going out of the room
alive."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DISOBEYED; WERE YOU PUNISHED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I was punished.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW?</p><p><br></p><p>A: In every possible way corporal punishment was used. I was punished
but I was never angry and I had no complaint. I said...</p><p>Q: YOU WERE HIT? YOU WOULD BE HIT BY YOUR FATHER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. My father hit me, and he... Q: WITH HIS HAND?</p><p>A: With his hand. And his whole life he repented for that one hit.
Only once... because I had long hairs when I was a small child; I had
very long hairs. And my father was in continuous trouble because he was
a small shop- keeper, and I was continuously passing through the shop;
the house was behind the shop. And everybody will ask, "Whose daughter
is this?" That was very much hurting him -</p><p>- that he has to tell everybody that `he is my boy, not my daughter'.
And one day he became very angry and he said, "This is an unnecessary
irritation... and the whole day you are coming in and out. Either you
start going through the back door or you cut your hairs." And he hit
me.</p><p>I simply went to a barber shop just in front of my house. And I told
him, "Shave my hairs completely." He was an old opium addict --
otherwise nobody would have cut my hairs completely. So he was in his
mood -- he simply shaved my whole head. In India you shave your head
completely only when your father dies; otherwise nobody will shave your
hairs.</p><p>I came back, and before I came back home, others had already reached
there, thinking that my father is dead. My father was sitting there, and
they said, "What is the matter? I saw your son shaved -- and you are
alive!"</p><p>Then I reached there and he said, "What have you done?" I said, "This
is the answer to your hit. If you are against long hairs, you will be
half against small hairs" I said, "Let's satisfy you one hundred
percent. So I have shaved them completely. And in the future, remember:
if you want to hit me, I will not complain about it, but I will respond
in my own way."</p><p>Q: SHOULD CHILDREN DEFY THEIR PARENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. If Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God there would have
been nothing in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN SHOULD CHILDREN OBEY THEIR PARENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Nobody should obey anybody unless your intelligence says it is
right. But that is you obeying your intelligence -- not your father, not
your mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IS A CHILD PREPARED TO DO THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO IF A CHILD CHOOSES TO WALK INTO WHAT AN ADULT...</p><p><br></p><p>A: Perfectly good. Rather than creating this stupid and mediocre
world, it is far better that few thousand children every year jump into
the ocean and die -- but leave the world with intelligent, rebellious,
vibrant people.</p><p>Q: BUT THAT WOULD TERRIFY PARENTS.</p><p>A: Let them be terrified! I have terrified my parents -- why should I
bother about other parents?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT YOU'VE NOT BEEN A PARENT. ISN'T THAT TOO EASY FOR YOU TO
SAY?</p><p>A: No, because I know my parents and it was not easy for them. In
fact I had not been a parent because of them, because they wanted me to
be married. I said, "Then there is no way. If you keep quiet, some day
perhaps I may get married. But if you continue in some way persuading
me, then there is no way."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF YOU SAW A CHILD PUTTING HIMSELF OR HERSELF IN DANGER, YOU WOULD
NOT REACH OUT TO THAT CHILD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will tell the child that "there is danger, and you are going
into danger; you can die. I can make help available to you if you want,
but if you have decided to go into it, then go -- with all my
blessings."</p><p>Q: YOU WOULD NOT PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN A CHILD WHO INSISTED ON WALKING
ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS?</p><p>A: No, I will not. I will not interfere in anybody's freedom,
whatsoever the freedom is for.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THAT'S ONLY THE FREEDOM TO DESTROY YOURSELF. A: No.</p><p>Q: IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD.</p><p>A: This is only one case. The question is: out of a hundred cases
there may be one case where your example may be applicable In about
ninety-nine cases there is no death involved. Just for one percent I am
not going to destroy the freedom of ninety-nine percent of the
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IS THAT ANY MEANINGFUL LIMIT ON A CHILD'S FREEDOM -- TO
PROTECT THE CHILD FROM DANGER?</p><p>A: I will tell everything to him, and if he allows me I will help him
physically to get out. But if he says that he wants to go into it, that
he understands what I am saying, then with all my good wishes he can
go.</p><p>Q: AND IF PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU ARE TOO DETACHED FROM THE WORLD, YOU
ARE MAKING NO SENSE EXCEPT YOURSELF; WHAT YOU SAY REALLY DOESN'T APPLY
TO THE BROAD POPULATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't care -- why should it apply? Everybody has intelligence,
everybody has to decide for himself. This whole idea that you should
interfere in other people's life is being brought by the political
leaders, by the religious leaders. They have conditioned the whole
humanity that you have to serve others, you have to sacrifice yourself,
that you have not to be selfish. My whole approach is that you have to
be selfish, and only if you enjoy serving somebody -- serve -- because
there is no other reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT SERVICE TO THE POOR: YOU'VE SAID A FEW
THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not a consistent man -- you should remember that.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SHOULD YOU BE HELPING THE POOR? ARE WE NOT OBLIGED AS HUMAN BEINGS
TO HELP THOSE IN LESSER SITUAITONS?</p><p>A: No. All these are just nonsense words: `human beings' -- where are
human beings? Just in theory... Monkeys never became man -- perhaps
human monkeys may have become -- but I cannot say Ronald Reagan is a
man; a chimpanzee perhaps.</p><p>Human beings would not have been in such a stupid state in the first
place. Why is there so much poverty? -- those poor people are
responsible for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE POOR PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN DILEMMA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO SOMEONE WHO LIVED IN THE GHETTOS OF NEW YORK
OR CHICAGO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I have lived in India which is far worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND WERE YOU SAYING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. I have been saying there and they were trying to kill me.
They are responsible because they have accepted religious ideas which
make them poor. They have accepted a certain ideology that your poverty
is your past life's</p><p>punishment: in your past life you have committed bad actions --
that's why you're poor.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT THE POOR OF THE UNITED STATES BELIEVE,
BHAGWAN.</p><p>A: No, I don't know about... This they cannot believe, but they also
believe that you are born is sin; you are born because Adam and Eve
disobeyed God. And the whole humanity has to suffer for it until you
repent, until you become Christians, until you become a follower of
Jesus, who will persuade God -- because he is the only begotten son of
God -- to save you. So the question has been removed from its real
context: that there is exploitation. The rich are rich because they know
how to exploit. The poor are poor because they are not intelligent
enough and not allowed to be intelligent enough so that they are not
exploited -- one thing. Second -- the poor go on increasing the
population of their own; the rich people don't increase their
population.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO SHOULD THE POOR BE PUNISHED FOR THAT?</p><p>A: They are already punished. Who is saying that they should be
punished? Q: WHEN YOU SPEAK THIS WAY YOU SOUND SO UNSYMPATHETIC.</p><p>A: I am, I am.</p><p>Q: YOU ARE UNSYMPATHETIC TO THE POOR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am, because those poor are a great calamity on the earth, and
they go on producing because they don't have any other entertainment
than sex. And they are not ready to listen to me. They are ready to
listen to the pope, who goes on saying that birth control is against
God, that the pill is the worst thing that has happened to humanity,
that abortion is anti-life. They listen to these people, and these
people are making them more and more poor.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD THE POOR SAVE THEMSELVES BY LISTENING TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly -- immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HOW WOULD THAT WORK, THOUGH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It would work immediately. For example, in India I had been
telling people for thirty years to use birth control methods, to use the
pill, to use abortion --</p><p>whatsoever prevents population growth. But it goes against their
religious ideas, it goes against their tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE TO BEGIN PRACTICING BIRTH CONTROL, THAT
WOULD NOT PAY THEIR FOOD BILL FOR THE NEXT MONTH. HOW CAN THEY SAVE
THEMSELVES NOW BY LISTENING TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The government was providing for free every birth control method.
And in thirty years they have doubled the population. When I started
speaking to them they were one four hundred million Indians; now there
are eight hundred million Indians.</p><p>Q: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POOR TONIGHT; THE PERSON WHO IS HUNGRY TONIGHT,
THE PERSON WHO HAS NO MONEY TO PAY HIS ELECTRIC BILL TONIGHT; WHAT CAN
HE DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He should go to the church and first ask the priest there to give
him food. Ask your god, ask your savior -- he has been saying that he is
coming back. Two thousand years have passed and and he has not come back
yet, so `you give us'. And your savior was turning stones into bread,
walking on water, raising the dead. So why can't the pope do the same?
He's his representative, an infallible representative -- he should do
all these things. If he cannot, then burn the whole Vatican.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU SPEAK WITH SO MUCH DISDAIN FOR JESUS, ALTHOUGH WE ARE IN PART
OF THE COMMUNE CALLED JESUS GROVE, AND IN THE PAST YOU HAVE SPOKEN
RATHER FONDLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, OF JESUS AS A... FIGURE. HAVE YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I have spoken about only half of Jesus before; now the
remaining half. Before, I spoke abut the day; now I am speaking about
the night -- twenty-four hours I have to finish.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE THE GURU OF THE RICH, THE YUPPIES' GURU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: People don't say -- I say. This is actually the fact. That's why I
say I am not</p><p>like other public figures. Nobody -- Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha --
had the guts to say that they are the rich man's guru, and they all
were. Buddha had all of the kings of India come to his feet, offer him
thousands of acres of land and gardens. He was the rich man's guru but
he had not the guts to say it. I have the guts to simply say what is the
fact: I am the rich man's guru, because only a rich man can be religious
-- a poor man cannot be.</p><p>For example, if you ask Albert Einstein, "Can you teach a poor man
higher mathematics, physics?" he will say, "How can I? First he has to
go through the complete courses of the university and at least have a
master's degree in physics. Then, perhaps I may be able to start from
scratch."</p><p>Religion up to now has never asked for any qualifications from
anybody. And religion is the highest experience in life. This is a
strange situation: Only a rich man -- who has lived with all luxuries,
all comforts, who has attained to his ambitions and is now feeling that
nothing satisfies, that nothing brings the delight he was hoping for --
is ready to go into the direction of religion. A poor man asks for food,
a poor man asks for medicine; he does not ask for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: HE HAS MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS THOUGH, BHAGWAN.</p><p>A: And I don't have food to offer him.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT IS IT A WORTHY WAY TO SPEND A LIFETIME, MINISTERING TO THE
RICH?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Only one man in the whole world ministering to the rich, and the
religions -- three hundred religions are there -- and all their priests
and all their public servants are serving the poor. And just look: one
man is looking after the whole rich world so well, and everything is
going perfectly well. And all those idiots -- three hundred religions --
and millions of monks and nuns, and what are they doing?</p><p>Q: WELL, YOUR JOB IS EASIER THOUGH, ISN'T IT?</p><p>A: So I am ready to change. If they have guts, I am ready to change
-- I can become the pope, pope can come here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE THE
POPE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: First I will destroy Catholicism completely.… Because if six
hundred million people are deleted from the world, we have solved a
great problem for poverty.</p><p>Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY USE FOR PROSTESTANTISM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will take them when their number comes. First: Catholics...
because Protestantism is nothing much -- it is below my dignity even to
condemn them.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU DON'T THINK OF MARTIN LUTHER AS A SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL?</p><p>A: Martin Luther was simply a politician, and wanted to be a pope
himself. Because he could not be a pope -- so the protest, and the
Protestantism. And that is just a German mind and nothing else. And you
cannot think...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF A GERMAN MIND?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just zero! Mind and German...? German and mind are contradictory
terms. Q: WHAT KIND OF MIND SCORES HIGHER?</p><p>A: Polacks! They are the highest. So just see a single man taking
care of the whole world's rich people, without moving out of his place,
and all these people are taking care of the poor... And just compare the
work of one man against three hundred religions and their millions of
servants, and you can see.</p><p>In my commune, not a single baby has been born in four years, and I
have not told anybody that you have not to give birth. Simply stating
that the world is too much populated... you should think -- you are
intelligent.</p><p>Q: THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE CHILDREN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For twenty to thirty years there should be no children. Only then
can we cut</p><p>the population to one-fourth of what it is now. And once one-fourth
of the population is there, then every couple can be allowed to have two
children.</p><p>Q: HOW COULD THAT EVER WORK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: If it is not going to work, then AIDS will work, then third world
war will work.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU HAVE A VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT INCLUDES A THIRD WORLD
WAR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: If I am not the alternative, then there is no world. Q: YOU OR
WORLD WAR III?</p><p>A: It is me or the whole world. Really, things have come to such a
point: either they have to listen me or go to hell.</p><p>Whomsoever they have listened to up to now have led them wrong. The
politicians have created the nations, the wars, and now the ultimate war
-- the third world war -- they are preparing for every day, piling up
more and more nuclear weapons. They already have more than are need --
seven hundred times</p><p>more. They can destroy the whole earth seven hundred times -- still
they are piling up. I don't know what kind of arithmetic these people
have learned.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE TO RONALD REAGAN IN REGARD TO NUCLEAR
WEAPONS?</p><p>A: Just drop all those nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean -- that
is the meaning of the name `Pacific Ocean'. Drop all nuclear weapons. Be
first and declare that "we are not for war, whatsoever the
consequence."</p><p>Q: DO YOU FEAR THE SOVIET UNION?</p><p>A: There is no problem, nothing to be worried [about]. If the whole
world drops war, what can Soviet Union do? Let them conquer the whole
world -- what is wrong? Rather than getting destroyed completely, it is
perfectly good to have a Soviet government all over the world. What is
wrong in it?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IN THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A TERM PEOPLE DESPISE: 'BETTER DEAD THAN
RED'</p><p><br></p><p>A: So then, be dead; but we have decided to be red. We are not
deciding for being dead. So our slogan is: Better to be red than
dead.</p><p>It is only a question... Just think: if I say [this] to Soviet
leaders, they will ask the same question that `American is going to run
over us'. If I say to Americans, they think `the Soviet Union is going
to run over us'. So nobody is willing to do it first, but somebody has
to do it first. And America, being a far more intelligent, far younger
nation, far more democratic, far more intelligent -- I would like to
appeal to America first: that you be the pioneer.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE SAID SOME HARSH THINGS RECENTLY ABOUT AMERICA. YOU SAID
THAT VIOLENCE IS THE RELIGION OF AMERICA...</p><p>A: I say all kinds of things in different contexts.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE SAID THAT "I BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS THE RELIGION OF
AMERICA, THAT AMERICA HAS MISTREATED MANY GROUPS: RED INDIANS, BLACK
PEOPLE..."</p><p><br></p><p>A: That's true.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY, THEN, DO YOU REMAIN HERE IF YOU FIND SO MUCH EVIL IN THE
UNITED STATES?</p><p>A: I will fight it.</p><p>Q: WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT, SAY, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION?</p><p>A: We are creating the commune of joyous, happy, silent, dancing,
singing, loving people. And this commune is going to create a sabotage
your whole American Society. If just a small atom can explode and
destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then don't think a small commune cannot
sabotage the whole American continent.</p><p>Q: HOW WILL THAT WORK?</p><p><br></p><p>A: You will know only when it has worked. Had you any idea how atom
bomb would worked before it worked? Even those who made it had no idea
how it would work. Einstein suffered his whole life after Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, repenting that,in the first place, he wrote a letter to
President Roosevelt that atom bombs can be made. He was not aware that
so much is possible through a single explosion. And now we have seven
hundred times more power to destroy.</p><p>This small commune is a life-energy phenomenon. If dead matter can
explode... This type of experiment has never been done; what we are
doing here is totally new -- we are creating a certain kind of energy
field.</p><p>Q: THIS IS WHAT THE EVANGELICALS SAY. REALISTICALLY, DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL HAPPEN?</p><p>A: Those people have no idea what is going on here. Don't compare
with all those retarded people.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: LIKE BILLY GRAHAM, FOR INSTANCE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. Billy Graham is the final word as far as retarded people are
concerned. You can even just look at his face, and this is a face of a
chimpanzee, not of a man. Well shaved.… Dressed in American way, but he
is a chimpanzee. Just undress him and you will find...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHICH IDEAS OF HIS DO YOU FIND MOST OFFENSIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Everything, because I find Jesus a crackpot -- so what about these
people. I don't criticize Billy Graham or that kind of people. I think
of Jesus as a crackpot, and these are...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF REVEREND MOON?</p><p>A: He should be sentenced for his whole life, not for one and a half
years... and with him, all the other bishops and priests who have signed
a petition for him, that he should be released and should not be
punished.</p><p>Q: ARE YOU DISTRESSED THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT YOU AND REVEREND MOON
IN THE SAME CATEGORY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: They can put wherever -- everybody is free to do that. In fact,
Moon's and my name mean exactly the same thing: the moon.</p><p>Q: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?</p><p>A: Absolute difference -- there is nothing similar. I don't have any
god, I don't have any paradise, I don't have a savior, I don't have a
gospel, I don't have a holy book, I don't teach a certain theology,
doctrine, creed, discipline. On the contrary: I teach individuality,
freedom, doubt, skepticism, agnosticism: these words are anathema to
those people like Reverend Moon.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: AND YET, IN YOUR COMMUNITY THERE IS A SENSE OF ORDER AND AUTHORITY
HERE.</p><p>A: There is a sense of order, and that sense or order is coming out
of the intelligent people living here. Nobody is ordering.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT THOSE PEOPLE SAY THEY DRAW THEIR ENERGY FROM YOU.</p><p>A: They can say whatsoever they want to say -- what do I have to do
with that? Nobody is ordering, nobody is trying to enforce a certain
system of them. I am simply explaining my experience, my attitude, my
approach to life, and leaving it to them. If they want to live, they are
free; if they don't want to live, they are free. If they want to be
here, good; if they want to go away, that is even better.</p><p>Q: I SPOKE TO A YOUNG WOMAN TODAY WHO ONCE SAID THAT, WHILE SHE
THOUGHT THERE WAS NOT CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD EVER DO THIS, THAT IF YOU
DID AS JIM JONES DID, SUGGEST A MASS SUICIDE, THAT SHE WOULD HOPE THAT
SHE WOULD DO THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHAT DO YOU FEEL? WHAT DO YOU
THINK?</p><p>A: Certainly, that woman is telling her heart. She is not telling
anything about me</p><p>-- she is telling about herself. And as far as she is concerned, you
have to ask her. That is her love for me, but I have not asked anybody
to die for me -- I have asked people to live for me.</p><p>This is the only place on the earth where Jonestown cannot happen,
because I am in total love with life -- with everything that life is.
There is no denial, no renunciation of anything. And I would like my
people to live as long as possible. But if somebody feels that way, that
is his freedom. What can I do, I...</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT A FANATICAL KIND OF RESPONSE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, not at all. Not at all. Q: WHY NOT?</p><p>A: It is simply her love.</p><p>Q: ISN'T THAT A DANGEROUS KIND OF LOVE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Love is always dangerous. So people who are not capable of living
dangerously are not capable of loving, either.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE JONESTOWN INCIDENT, WHAT DID YOU
THINK?</p><p>A: I thought this is where Jesus had led people. This was Jesus's
doing. If I get</p><p>him, I am going to slap him on both his cheeks together, so he cannot
give me another cheek.…</p><p>Because that's the whole conclusion, logical conclusion, of Jesus.
Jesus was telling to his people that he is going to his Father's house
to prepare a place for them, and then he will come and take them. Now
two thousand years have passed; he did not come back.</p><p>Now it is simply logical that Jim Jones thinks, "Why bother first
going, preparing?" -- it is better to take the whole lot with you. I
think this seems to be more logical and mathematical, and if Jesus had
done that, that would have been better -- there would have been no
Christianity. That would have been a great blessing in the world: if he
had taken those twelve fools that he used to call apostles, humanity
would have been saved from so much misery and suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOUR FOLLOWERS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOOLS AS WELL.</p><p><br></p><p>A: They are!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: DO YOU TELL THEM THAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes. They are here -- I tell them.</p><p>Q: THEY JUST DON'T LISTEN THOUGH?</p><p>A: They do not. They know me -- they don't care what I say.</p><p>Q: YOU ONCE LIVED A VERY SIMPLE KIND OF LIFE; NOW YOU LIVE A VERY
OPULENT KIND OF LIFE. WHAT HAPPENED?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am just a contradictory man. One day I can again live a simple
life; there is no problem in it. But whatsoever I do, I do it
totally.</p><p>Q: IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL GIVE ALL THIS UP?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Every possibility -- any moment, because in the first place,
nothing belongs to me, so I have not to give up anything. This watch is
given to me for your interview. In my room, I am not... even wearing a
watch. The car comes to me when they have to take me here. Nothing
belongs to me. Everything belongs to the commune or to the Trust. So in
the first place, I am still a poor man -- pretending to be a rich
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: IF YOU GAVE ALL THIS UP, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will just go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: PERMANENTLY, OR FOR THE EVENING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Permanently.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO ALL THIS AFTER YOU ARE DEAD?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't care, because nobody bothers. When I was not here, I was
not concerned abut the world; neither the world was concerned about me.
When I am not here, you think only one thing: that I am dead. You forget
the other part: that you are dead for me, too. The connection is
finished: The world is no more there for me, just as I am no more there
for you. I become absent to you; you become absent to me.</p><p>Q: DO YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I know; I don't believe. I don't believe in anything.… I know my
own past lives. That's why I know there is reincarnation.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT WERE YOUR PAST LIVES?</p><p>A: Now, that will be a belief for you, only fiction. And a man who
can write three hundred fifty books can write three hundred fifty
fictions, also. So that is not much use...</p><p>Q: BUT HOW MANY LIVES HAVE YOU HAD IN THE PAST?</p><p>A: As many as you want. One thing I can say: I can lead you to the
point from where you can look at your past lives -- at least one life --
and that will be proof enough of reincarnation. Telling my stories will
not be of any use.</p><p>Q: COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLE OF HOW IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No. I never give anything which can become a belief in any
way.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT ABOUT FUNERAL PREPARATIONS? HAVE YOU MADE SOME
ARRANGEMENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: WOULD YOU WANT TO BE CREMATED IN THE NEW CREMATORIUM?</p><p><br></p><p>A: That my people will think of. Who bothers? -- I am gone. People
are so much worried about controlling, things, even after their death.
When I am not there, this body is just matter. So whatsoever they want
to do... if they want to throw it into the river, most probably that
will be the right thing.</p><p>Q: DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE IN OREGON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I don't know. If I get the green card, I may go out. If I don't
get the green card, I am going to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA WORRIED NOW, I UNDERSTAND?</p><p>A: In the whole world I have my communes, but everywhere I will have
the same problem, so first I will have to settle here. If the green card
is settled here, then I will go to Australia to fight again -- whatever
card they have.</p><p>Q: THE LAST THING, BHAGWAN: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE PEOPLE OF
AMERICA?</p><p>A: I certainly have a message. Because America is not an old country
like India, which has existed for thousands of years and has a burden of
a long past, prejudice, conditioning. America is just a child compared
to a country like India or China -- three hundred years mean
nothing.</p><p>America has a very superficial layer of conditioning. If it can drop
that conditioning -- being Christian, being Jew, being American --
America can become the first country of the world opening the doors for
a new humanity. It is a risk thing, dangerous, but only America is young
enough to take the risk.</p><p>Drop all religions, drop the boundaries of the country, throw away
all nuclear weapons, declare to the whole world that "we are no more for
war -- if anybody wants to invade us, we will welcome them."</p><p>Q: IF YOU WERE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND YOU CHOSE TO VOTE; WOULD YOU
BE A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will be simply what I am. I cannot conceive myself in any other
role.…</p><p>They both are the same type of people -- this is just a political
conspiracy. It depends on a certain psychology of people, and democracy
is using it.</p><p>People's memory is very short -- three years. So four years, five
years, one party rules, and naturally it cannot fulfill all the promises
that it has given to the people. It starts falling in people's eyes, and
for five years the other party has been giving promises that "we will do
what they have not done." So after five years, the other party comes on
top, and this game goes on playing. Those two parties are conspirators,
shareholders in the same company. It is a rotation of a wheel.</p><p>I don't see any difference in their ideology; I don't see any
difference in their principles; I don't see any difference in their
faces -- they are all the same people, playing a game. It is a football:
one time on this side and one team on that side. It doesn't make any
difference to me.</p><p>I am against parties. I want democracy to be partyless. Unless it is
partyless, it cannot be democracy -- it is only temporary dictatorship.
Four years, five years or whatsoever time in different countries... You
give to a party four years' dictatorship: it is temporary dictatorship;
it is not democracy.</p><p>Democracy will be possible only when there are no political parties
and each individual decides on his own. Nobody is going to campaign,
nobody is going to convince him. He is not a party member; he has not to
follow a party line -- he has to decide himself.</p><p>Q: RONALD REAGAN THINKS HE PRESIDES OVER A DEMOCRACY. IS HE
INCORRECT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Absolutely incorrect. He does not preside over Rajneeshpuram.</p><p>Q: IS HE A DELUDED MAN?</p><p>A: He is... senile.</p><p>Q: HE'S TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: He really should go back to cowboy work, cowboy films, to
Hollywood -- don't waste the time of the world unnecessarily. Even as a
cowboy actor, he was a third class actor.</p><p>Q: YOU LIKE MOVIES, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Once in a while, if my people suggest them to me. Perhaps one or
two which</p><p>I liked. One was "The Brothers Karamazov." That is Dostoevsky's novel
that I have always loved, and I consider it more valuable than the holy
bible. Another was "Anna Karenina" by Leo Tolstoy. That is a masterpiece
of genius. So once in a while, if somebody sees something beautiful that
they would like my time to be wasted on, they bring it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU LIKED "PATTON" AND "THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS."</p><p><br></p><p>A: "Ten Commandments" I liked, as a film! Q: YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE
BOOK!</p><p>A: No. `Commandment' -- the very word -- is not for me.</p><p>Q: DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME LOOKING AT VIDEOS? A: No.</p><p>Q: AND YOU'RE NOT READING ANYTHING ANY MORE?</p><p>A: No, for five years I have not read anything, but before five years
I have read as much as people will read in five lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><ul class=share-buttons><li><a target=_blank

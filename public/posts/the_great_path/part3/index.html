It is for research only.]\nA SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA. TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH. A TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC IS A MEANS TO SELF-REALIZATION. TO ENJOY THE BLISSFULNESS OF THE EXISTENCE IS ENLIGHTENMENT.\nA SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA.\nTry to understand this.\nIn the dictionary, “wonder” means astonishment. But there is a basic difference between wonder and astonishment. If you fail to understand this basic difference, you may embark on a different journey altogether. Astonishment is the foundation of science, a sense of wonder is that of yoga. Astonishment is extrovert; wonder is introvert. Astonishment is about the other; wonder is about our own self. This is the first point.\nWonder is born out of that which we cannot understand, which makes us speechless, which our intellect cannot grasp, which proves to be bigger than us, before whom we are suddenly dumfounded – which destroys us.\nIf the same state of wonder – which is born when we are faced with the illogical, the incomprehensible – is diverted towards the external objects, it gives birth to science. When we start thinking about matter, when we start contemplating the world and try to investigate that mystery that\nsurrounds us all, science is created. Science is born out of astonishment. Astonishment means, it has embarked on the outward journey.\nThere is one more difference between wonder and astonishment: if we are surprised by something, sooner or later we will be fed up with that surprise, because surprise creates tension; hence the effort of destroying that which surprises us. Science is born out of this surprise. Then it destroys the surprise. It tries to find interpretations, doctrines, formulas, keys and it does not rest assured till it destroys the mystery, till it is in possession of knowledge, till science can claim: “Yes, I have understood!”\nScience is bent upon eradicating the element of astonishment from the world. If it succeeds in achieving that, there will not be a single thing on earth that man cannot boast of not knowing. It means, this world will be godless, because God means that which we cannot claim to know even if we have known him. We may know him but he remains unknowable. We may go on deepening our knowledge of him, he cannot be exhausted. We are in the state of eternal wonder about him.\nThere are some objects which have become known to us. We can call them, the known. There are some other objects which we do not know but we will know them. Let us call them, the unknown. And the existence also consists of such objects which we have never known and about which we will never be able to know. We will call them, the unknowable. God is unknowable. This is the third element. Science does not accept God because it says that nothing is unknowable in the world. We may have not known it up to now, maybe we did not try hard enough, but sooner or later we will know. Some day we will know the world completely; nothing will remain unknown in it.\nScience is born out of astonishment and then it begins to destroy the astonishment. Therefore, I call science patricidal: it tries to kill that which created it. Religion is just the opposite. Religion is also born out of a certain astonishment; this sutra calls it, “sense of wonder.” The only difference is: when a religious seeker is filled with wonder, he does not set out on the outer journey, he goes on an inner pilgrimage. Whenever some kind of mystery envelops him, he starts thinking about himself: I must know who I am.\nIf the mystery becomes introspective, and the search and the journey is directed inwards, the arrow of the seeking points towards the self, the attention is totally absorbed by the thirst to know our own reality – then it is wonder.\nAnd the second point to be understood is that the sense of wonder is inexhaustible. The more we know, the more it increases. That’s why wonder is contradictory. As a rule, the sense of wonder should disappear the moment we come to know something. But Buddha or Krishna or Shiva or Christ do not lose their sense of wonder. When they attain the ultimate consciousness, their sense of wonder becomes ultimate! At that time they do not say that they have known everything, they say that after knowing everything everything remains to be known.\nThe Upanishads have said, “Even if you extract the whole from the whole, the whole remains.” Even if you know the whole, the whole remains to be known. Therefore spiritual knowledge does not nourish the ego, scientific knowledge nourishes the ego. Spiritual knowledge will never make you a knower; you will always remain humble. And the more you know, the more you will feel, “I do not know anything.” At the highest peak of knowledge you will be able to say, “I know nothing.” At the moment of ultimate knowledge the whole existence fills you with a sense of wonder.\nIf science succeeds, the whole world will become known; if religion succeeds, the whole world will become unknown. If science is victorious, you, the knower, will be full of ego and the world will become ordinary because where there is no sense of wonder, everything becomes prosaic; where there is no wonder, there is no spirit; if there is no possibility of mystery, the process of evolution comes to a dead end. The thirst for knowledge has vanished, curiosity has died.\nIf science has its way, the world will be filled with such boredom as it has never experienced before. If Westerners are more bored, science has to blame for that, because people are losing their capacity to feel wonder. They are not amazed by anything. They have forgotten to be amazed. If you put a problem before them which has no solution, they will say, “Oh! It can be solved!” – because according to science, basically, there is nothing that can remain unknown forever; it can be unveiled.\nThe religious journey is, however, paradoxical. The more we unveil, the more we find that the mystery goes on deepening. The nearer you come, the more you come to know: it is very difficult to know. And the moment we penetrate the very center of the existence, everything becomes mysterious. For the Buddha, the stones and pebbles lying on the ground are as mysterious as the twinkling stars high up in the sky: It is not only the enormous that appears to be mysterious, the smallest happening holds the same mystery for him. A seed sprouting in the soil is as mysterious as the creation of the whole universe.\nSo, as the sense of wonder becomes intense, your eyes will become like those of a small child. A child is wonderstruck by everything. Watch a child walking on the street – everything surprises him. A colored stone looks like a diamond. You laugh at him because you are the knower; you know that it is colored stone. You tell him, “Don’t be crazy, this is not a diamond.” But the child wants to put it in his pocket. You will say, “Don’t carry this burden. After all, it’s a dirty stone lying in the mud. Throw it away!”\nBut the child grips it harder. You are not able to understand it. It is a wonder for the child. This colored stone is in no way less valuable than the diamond. The value lies in the sense of wonder. Stones are of no value. A tiny butterfly can mesmerize the child immensely, but you will not be mesmerized by the almighty himself even if he comes to see you! The child starts chasing the butterfly.…\nThe highest state of wonder, of buddhahood is just like the innocence of a small child. One becomes childlike in that state. That’s why Jesus has said: Those who are like small children will be able to enter the kingdom of God. Jesus is saying the same thing that Shiva has said in this sutra: the sense of wonder is the foundation of yoga. Wonder is the first stage of yoga. In that case you have to understand many things.\nThe more knowledgeable you are, the weaker will be the foundation of yoga. If you are full of the pride of knowing, the chances of your becoming a yogi are less. If your heart is burdened with the scriptures, your sense of wonder will be destroyed. You ask a scholar about God, and he starts answering as if God is a thing to be made an answer of... as if God can be explained. You ask a scholar and he has a readymade answer. No sooner did you ask than the answer was given. Even God does not make him speechless. All the formulas are definite, he explains them instantaneously.\nBut you go to the Buddha and ask about God, he does not say anything. Perhaps you will go back thinking that this man remained silent, and the meaning is clear: he does not know. But the reason\nwhy this man remained silent is that this sense of wonder is the door to the divine. Had you been a little wiser, you would have remained with the man who did not answer. And you would have tried to understand him: you would have peeped into his eyes; you would have lived in his company, in his proximity because he has experienced something, and the experience is so immense that words cannot express it; he has seen something that cannot become an answer.\nQuestions and answers are alright for the school-children. Your question in itself is absurd. One cannot ask a question about God. How can one ask a question about the infinite? Both the question and the answer drop by themselves before the infinite. Your question is petty, that’s why Buddha has remained silent. But maybe you will come back thinking that had this man known, he would have answered. He did not answer, that means he did not know. You recognize a scholar because your head is full of words, too. You will not be able to understand a sage because a sage is full of wonder. And your sense of wonder is dead.\nThe greatest calamity of the world is: destruction of wonder. The day your sense of wonder is destroyed, your possibility of liberation is destroyed. The day your sense of wonder is dead, your childlike heart is dead, frozen. You have become old.\nAre you still amazed? Does life pose a question to you? Are you thrilled by the chirping of the birds, the sound of the running streams, the wind rustling through the trees? Do you feel joy? Does this life surrounding you everywhere makes you speechless? No, because you know that birds are making these sounds and wind is rustling through the trees – you have answer to every question. These answers have killed you. You have become knowledgeable before attaining knowledge.\nA SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA.\nA sense of wonder becomes a door for one who wants to enter yoga. Revive your childhood! Start asking again. Awaken your curiosity, your quest and the roots of life that have dried in you will start greening again. All the blocks will melt away and streams will start running. Open your eyes and look all around once again – all answers are false, because all your answers are borrowed. You have not known anything. But you are stuffed with borrowed knowledge, to the extent that you feel, you known it.\nAwaken your sense of wonder. Your yoga-postures and breath-exercises are useless if there is no sense of wonder within you – because all the yogic exercises belong to the body. It’s true that your body will be purified, healthy but purified and healthy body will not help you to attain divinity.\nA sense of wonder purifies the heart. Wonder means: the mind is free of all answers. Wonder means: you have removed all the garbage of answers. Your question has become new, rejuvenated; you have understood your ignorance.\nWonder means: I do not know. Scholarship means: I know.\nThe more you know, the more you are wrong. When you are simple enough to say: “I don’t know” – although this too is not sufficient – when the understanding of your own ignorance settles deep into\nyour heart, you have taken the first step of yoga. After that, other steps are very easy. If you miss the first step, you may go on traveling endlessly, it will be of no use. One who misses the first step cannot reach the destination. If your first step is right, half of the distance is covered.\nA sense of wonder is the first step.\nLook closely, do you possess knowledge? If you observe deeply, you will realize that there is no knowledge, just garbage collected from scriptures, masters, saints and you have preserved it like a priceless possession! It has not given you anything, it has only killed your sense of wonder. Your sense of wonder is writhing, lying dead. Now you are not surprised. Nothing surprises you any more.\nThere was a Christian mystic, Eckhart. He has made a unique statement: one who is surprised by everything is a saint. Everything, very small happenings surprise him. A pebble falls in the water, creates noise, ripples start spreading – the saint is amazed. It is so wondrous, so mysteriousness! He breathes, lives, it is quite amazing.\nEvery morning while praying to God Eckhart used to say, “It is another day! The sun has risen again. Thy mercy is great. What would we do if the sun would not have arisen? Human being is helpless.” Eckhart used to say, “Today I am breathing, tomorrow I may not; what can I do?”\nYou cannot draw breath from somewhere. It is not in your control. Breath is so close to you, and yet you do not own it. If it goes out and does not return, it will just return! We do not know or possess a thing which is so close to you. And we think that we know everything. This ‘knowing everything’ has killed you. Remove this garbage and unburden yourself. Immediately, when the blindfold of knowledge will be removed from your eyes, they will be filled with mystery.\nThe inner pilgrimage of this mystery is called wonder; the outward journey is called astonishment. If you apply those mysteries to objects, you will become a scientist and if you are able to apply that mystery to your own self, you will become a great yogi. And in both the cases the results will be different, because astonishment is violent, sense of wonder is nonviolent. Surprise applied anywhere, starts disintegrating, analyzing because surprise is restless, wonder is full of interest. Try to understand this difference properly. It is not written in the dictionary; it cannot be written because the compiler of the dictionary has no idea what wonder is.\nAstonishment is violent, aggressive. When you are astonished by something, you become tense. That tension has to be dealt with. A certain restlessness will hang over you as long as your enquiry is not complete, you have not known. A scientist is engrossed in his laboratory eighteen hours a day... what for? He is restless, as if possessed by a ghost. And he will keep on investigating till he resolves it.\nBut the sense of wonder is not aggressive. And the sense of wonder is not a restlessness, on the contrary the sense of wonder is restfulness. Whenever someone is filled with wonderment one is at rest. You don’t have to destroy the sense of wonder, you have to drink it, you have to taste it. You have to merge with wonder, you have to become one with it. Astonishment is involved in destruction, wonder begins to live. Wonder is a way of life, astonishment is a violent state of mind.\nSo science thinks in terms of victory – destroy, shatter, win. Religion thinks in terms of surrender – dissolve yourself. When the sense of wonder will enter you, it will dissolve in you the same way a salt-cube is dropped into water and the whole water turns salty. That day you will become salty with wonder. Every fibre will be filled with wonder. While walking, moving around the sense of wonder will be pulsating within you. You will be in a perpetual state of wonder. Every phenomenon will become mysterious. The smallest particle will be a part of the vast, because the sense of wonder envelops the small, it becomes vast. Then nothing remains known, you are surrounded by mystery. Then every moment is new and every moment is an invitation.\nMulla Nasruddin was contesting the elections. While he was on his door-to-door campaign, he went to the local priest. Even at that time he was drunk. The priest was a gentleman; saying something directly would have been impolite so he said to Nasruddin, “I want to ask you something. If you give me a satisfying answer, my vote is all yours. Do you ever drink?” There was no need to ask about it. Mulla was taken aback. He said, “Before I answer your question, I would like to ask you something: Is it an enquiry or an invitation?”\nThe sense of wonder is an invitation.\nAstonishment is an enquiry and sense of wonder, invitation. The sense of wonder is an internal call. And as you enter inside, you go on immersing deeper and deeper. One day you will disappear and only wonder will remain. That day enlightenment has happened. If you follow the path of astonishment, one day only you will remain and astonishment will disappear. That is the culmination of science: ego will remain and astonishment will vanish. If you embark on the journey of wonder, you will vanish and wonder will remain, every pore of your being will be filled with its taste. Your existence itself will be a wonder.\nShiva has called it the foundation of yoga. Remove knowledge, become full of wonder. In the beginning it will appear difficult because you think that you know.\nThere was a great thinker, a very invaluable, important one: D. H. Lawrence. He was roaming in the garden with a small child. The child asked him, “Why are the trees green?”\nA child can only ask such questions – so fresh! You cannot even think of such questions. You will say, “The trees are green because they are green! What is there to ask? What kind of a question is this? This child is stupid. But think again, why the trees are green. Do you really know the answer? Perhaps someone studying science may answer,”It is the chlorophyll that makes them green.” But it will not resolve the question of the child. It will ask again, “Why is there chlorophyll in the tree? Why should it be in the tree and why not in the man? And how the chlorophyll has found the trees? The answer”chlorophyll” does not (answer?) any question.\nAll the answers found by science are of the same category. Those answers only push the question one step back, that’s all. If you are a little wise, you can raise the question again. Science cannot answer any “why.” That’s why science cannot destroy the sense of wonder, it can only create an illusion of destroying it.\nBut D. H. Lawrence was not a scientist. He was a poet, a novelist. He had an aesthetic sense. He stopped then and there and started thinking. He said to the child, “Give me some time. I don’t know myself.”\nYour child also must have asked many a time the same kinds of question. Have you ever said: “I don’t know?” It hurts the ego. Every father thinks that he knows. The child asks and the father gives an answer. And because of these very answers the father loses his credibility later on, because one day the child comes to know that you know nothing. You were unnecessarily giving answers. You are as ignorant as I am. You were a little older so your ignorance was older, that’s all. But you give answers to the small child. The child, too, accepts them thinking you may be right. But how long will he believe it?\nD.H. Lawrence stood there. He said, “I will think over it. And if you go on insisting, I can only say that the trees are green because they are green. There is no other answer. I am myself overwhelmed by this mystery.”\nIf you unveil the curtain of knowledge, you will find mystery all around. It is a mystery that the trees are green. It is also mysterious that the green trees have red flowers. And isn’t it mysterious that a small seed contains a giant tree in its womb? You preserve a seed and plant it after thousands of years, the tree materializes. Life seems to be eternal. Every moment is throbbing with mystery.\nBut you have closed your eyes. You rest assured. But this state is your inertia. You do not even hesitate, for the simple reason that your ego feels a reassurance that it knows. If you know, you feel secure; if you do not know, all security disappears. Actually you do not know anything but it hurts to admit that you do not know. So you cling to anything. A drowning man clings to a straw, takes its support. The thing you are clinging to is not even a straw. Perhaps a straw may save someone from drowning but the thing you are clinging to is not even a straw, it is just a dream, empty words.\nSomeone strongly believes in God. It is absurd to say that I definitely know. ‘Definitely’ means, now you have unraveled the mystery of God! ‘Definitely’ means you have seen through Him, you have measured Him. ‘Definitely’ means: even He can be measured, you have weighed Him in the balance, you have investigated in the laboratory. What is the meaning ‘definite’?\nThere is another man who definitely knows that God does not exist. Both are stupid and both of them have the same disease. One calls himself theist, another one calls himself atheist; and there is not an iota of difference between the two. Deep down both suffer from the same disease. Both of them believe that they know and both get into arguments.\nKnowledge creates argument, wonder creates dialogue. When you are filled with wonder, your life will have a dialogue. If somebody goes to Mahavira and asks: “Does God exist?” He says, “Yes.” Some atheist goes and says, “God does not exist,” and he says, “No, he does not.” And if some agnostic goes to him, Mahavira says, “God’s existence is dubious.”\nNow, it is very difficult. We would want him to give straight and clear answers. They may be wrong, but they should be clear. And remember, this existence is so complex that clear answers will prove wrong. Here, if the answer is not contradictory, it is bound to be wrong. Here, only that answer will be right which encompasses its opposite because existence absorbs its opposite.\nThere is life and there is death. The path is not clear-cut. Here darkness exists along with light. Good and evil exist together. Here the saint and the sinner are not separate, they are living simultaneously. Both are two aspects of the same coin. God contains both the poles within Him. Existence is vast. It is not chiseled on the touchstone of logic, it is beyond logic. The duality is merged into each other.\nOne night Junnaid prayed to God: “I want to know who is the greatest sinner in this village because by studying him, by understanding him I will try to abstain from the sin. I will have a criterion that here is the greatest sinner, I have to avoid this kind of life.” A voice said, “Your neighbor.” Junnaid was surprised. He had never imagined that his neighbor could be the greatest sinner. He was an ordinary man, running his own small shop, how can he be the greatest sinner? He had thought that the greatest sinner will be someone like Ravana [a mythological character who represents devil], the greatest sinner will be someone devilish, a satan. This man is running a shop, rearing his children.… Junnaid was perplexed. He was an ordinary man, nobody would call him a sinner.\nNext day while praying he said, “O.K., I accept your decision. Now I want one more criterion: I want to know about the greatest saint, a virtuous man in the village.” God said, “The same man, your neighbor.”\nJunnaid said, “You are confusing me. There is already great confusion in me. Yesterday I was watching the man all day, I did not feel that he was a sinner. Now this adds to the confusion: he is a virtuous man, too!”\nThe voice said, “In my existence the opposites are interlinked. It is the intellect that splits them into two. Here the greatest saint has a shadow. And here the greatest sinner has a glow on his face. This very phenomenon makes it possible for a saint to become a sinner and a sinner to become a saint. This transformation is possible so easily because both are hidden in one person.\nDarkness and light are not separate. Day and night are interrelated. Logic creates fragments and makes clear-cut paths. Logic is like a well-made, clean, cultivated garden. Life is like a forest; nothing is clear in it. Everything is entangled there.\nOne who wants to understand life should have the capacity to avoid readymade answers. If you cling to them, you feel secure because you feel reassured: Yes, I know! You feel confident and courageous enough to tread the path of life. That’s why you are afraid of dropping knowledge. It is very painful. If someone robs you of your wealth, it does not matter so much. You can earn it again. And wealth was dirt. You knew that already. If you lose your position, you can take it in your stride. You yourself can renounce it some day. But knowledge...!\nI have observed a very interesting phenomenon. Somebody renounces his society, his village, his house, his family but if he was Jaina he remains a Jaina in the Himalayas; if he was a Hindu he remains a Hindu; if he was a Mohammedan he remains a Mohammedan. It is the same society that he has renounced, that had given him this Mohammedan conditioning: that Koran is a true scripture, all other scriptures are false. He gives up everything but saves his knowledge even in the Himalayas. Nothing has changed in this man’s life because he still believes in knowledge.\nIf you drop knowledge, the Himalayas will appear wherever you are. The Himalayas will appear wherever you are. The Himalayas signify that which is mysterious; where there are high mountain peaks, you cannot scale them; and where there are unfathomable valleys, you will not be able to explore them; which transcends all our measures.\nThe sense of wonder means: where your intellect fails, where your ego is crippled, where you become helpless. You may laugh or cry there but you cannot utter a word.\nIt is said that when Moses reached the mountain Sanai, he cried, he laughed but he did not speak at all. When he returned, his disciples asked: “What have you done? God was present himself. He said unto you, ‘Remove you shoes because this is holy land and I am present here.’ And you removed your shoes. You cried, you laughed but why didn’t you say something? Why did you miss this opportunity? You could have asked whatever you wanted to ask. You could have at least asked for the key that opens all the doors.”\nMoses replied, “When He was present in front of me, my mind disappeared; only heart was throbbing. I laughed, I cried out of sheer joy!”\nAnd this is the interesting part of life – happiness can make you cry and happiness can make you laugh, too. So do not think that people always cry out of grief. It is a calculation of logic. Life does not believe in logic. The river of life breaks all the frontiers and overflows like a total wave. One can cry out of happiness. Then one’s tears have a different quality. Then bliss is reflected in the tears. He can cry, too! These opposites can express one principle. This is the mystery of life.\nSo Moses said, “Not only heart, I also lost my intellect. It seems that I dropped my conditioning along with my shoes.”\nAnd do not only remove your shoes outside the temple, drop your head, too! One who drops his head along with the shoes, can only enter the temple. And shoes and head get along very well! That’s why when you get angry with someone, you hit his head with your shoe. A monk hits his head with his own shoes.\nThese are the two extremes, two poles. The head is on one extreme... you are at the center. And that central point is a meeting place of all opposites. Your head and your feet are uniting there. Your heart abides there.\nSo Moses said, “I cried, I laughed because I was filled with wonder. I became speechless. Now I will not be able to sleep. I cannot erase that which I have seen. That which has happened cannot be wiped out. The Moses who lived before is no more. Now I am a different man.”\nThis is a new birth. Hindus call it ‘dvija’: twice born – when is born second time. All brahmins are not dwijas. Once in a while some brahmin becomes dwija. You do not become a dwija by wearing a sacred thread around your neck. Dwija means twice born. Moses said, “Now I am twice born. Now I am a different man. That person is dead.”\nIf you experience wonder, your old will die and the new will be born. And if you perpetually remain in the sense of wonder, the new is born and the old dies every moment. Every moment the old disappears and the new appears. And your flow is eternal. Then you will never become old; then the eternal life pulsates within you.\nShiva therefore says, the sense of wonder is the foundation of yoga.\nThe second maxim: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH.\nThe sense of wonder is the foundation. Wonder means an enquiry inwards. An internal search of the question: who am I? If you move outside, there is surprise. If you move outside, there is logic. If\nyou move outside, there is science. If you move inwards – sense of wonder, meditation, gratitude. It is a totally different method.\nThe sense of wonder will bring you inwards because the whole world will appear mysterious. And then only one question will seem to be important: who am I? This is the foundation of sense of wonder: who am I? As long as I do not know this ‘I’, this journey of knowing myself cannot be complete. How can I know these trees, how can I know you, how can I know the other if I myself am unknown to me, if I am myself ignorant; when I do not know who I am.\nTherefore ‘who am I’ is the great mantra. And don’t rush the answer because the answer is ready inside you. “Who am I” – and you answer from within: I am the soul. This answer won’t help. You know it already. This has not changed your life. Knowledge is fire; it will burn you. When you ask: “Who am I” and an inner voice replies, it is your mind that is talking – the scriptures hidden inside the mind, the memory. When you say: ‘I am the soul’, it is useless, it is of no value because this answer has not transformed you. This is not fire, this is ash. There may have been an amber in it some time, for some sage, but for you it is ash. The person who possessed this amber, has departed from this world, now you are just carrying the ash.\nYou go on asking: Who am I? And do not give a borrowed answer. Whenever the borrowed answer will come, you say: “This is not my answer. I have not known it, how can it be mine? Only that which I know, can belong to me.” That which you have earned through your own effort, is your treasure. Knowledge can neither be stolen nor can it be begged. You cannot steal it. You cannot beg it. Here, you have to create yourself by your own efforts.\nThe second maxim: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH.\nThe moment a sense of wonder is born, move inwards, sink within and try to be established in the self. When you ask: ‘Who am I’, when will you get an answer? If you want the answer, you will have to be established within. We have called it health: to be established in the self. And one is able to see only when one is established within. If you are running, how will you be able to see?\nYour situation is somewhat like this: you are sitting in a speeding car, you happen to see a flower, through the window. You have barely enquired about it, and the car has zoomed forward. You are speeding fast. And no vehicle is faster than your desire. If one has to reach the moon, even the spaceship takes time. Your desire does not even require this much time, it reaches this very moment. Desire has the fastest speed. And one who is full of desire shows that there is no depth in him. He is running, racing. And your pace is such that even if you ask: who am I, there is no room for an answer.\nYou will have to give up this running race and be established in the self. You will stop all the desire, all the running around, all the journey. But the moment one desire is fulfilled you create a number of new desires. You barely finish one journey, and various new avenues open up. And you start running again! You do not know how to sit down. You have not stopped for many lifes.\nI have heard that one emperor employed a very intelligent man as his prime minister. But the prime minister was dishonest and within no time he stole millions of rupees from the treasury of the empire. When the emperor came to know about it, he called the prime minister and said: “I don’t want to say\nanything. What you have done is not right. I will not say much but I can only say this much that it is a break of trust. Don’t ever show me your face again. You leave this kingdom and go elsewhere. And I would not like rumors to spread all around, so I will not tell anything to anyone about it and there is no need for you to utter a word about it.\nThe prime minister said: “If you command me, I shall leave. Certainly, I have stolen millions of rupees. Nevertheless, I would like to advise you as a prime minister that now I have everything: a big mansion, houses in the mountains and on the sea-shore. I have everything. My coming generations need not earn anything. You will remove me and appoint some other person and he will have to start from scratch.” The emperor was intelligent, he understood.\nYou never come to such a point in your life, when you can say: I have everything. Your trip will end when such a moment comes. Otherwise every moment you will have to start from scratch. Each and every moment, new desire grips you, a new thief enters, an new robber comes to rob you of your treasure. And the robber is not one, there are innumerable desires. You are running in many directions simultaneously. You have never given it a thought that many of the objects are opposite to each other; you cannot have them both. If you get one, you will lose another; if you get the second one, the first is lost.\nMulla Nasruddin was on his death-bed. He told his son: now, before I die, I will tell you about two things. Remember them. There are two things: honesty and wisdom. Now you will look after the shop, take care of the work. A signboard is hanging on our shop: ‘Honesty is the best policy’. Always practice it. Never cheat anybody. Never break a promise. If you promise, keep it.\nThe son said: “O.K., what about the other? What does wisdom mean?” Nasruddin said, “Never give a promise to anyone!”\nSuch is life – divided in opposite poles. There is an attempt to manage both: honesty and wisdom. Honesty aims at keeping a promise. On the one hand you want to be worshipped as a saint and on the other hand you want to enjoy like a sinner. Strange! On the one hand you wish that your character should be praised like that of Rama’s and on the other hand you are keen on kidnapping somebody’s wife. You want to do the impossible. You would like to become like Ravana and you want to be revered like Rama. Then we are in a difficult situation. Then you move in two opposite directions and you create infinite goals in front of you. In their pursuit you become fragmented, torn to pieces. At the end of your life you will find that the treasure that you had brought with you is lost.\nThere was a great gambler. His wife, his family, his friends tried their best to convince him. He did not pay any attention. Eventually everything was lost. At last he came to such a point that he had only one rupee left with him. His wife said: “Now wake up! Gather yourself!”\nThe husband said, “When so much is lost and only one rupee is left, give me a last chance. Who knows, this last bit of a rupee may prove lucky.” A gambler always thinks on these lines. And he said, “Now we have lost millions, this is the last rupee, why lament over it? And one rupee is bound to be spent, it cannot be saved. Let me stake it!”\nHis wife also thought: now that everything is lost, this is the last one; and one is going to be spent anyway, let him stake it!”\nThe gambler went to the joint. And he was amazed! He started winning every game. One became one thousand, one thousand were converted into ten thousand which became a hundred thousand eventually. At the end he staked those hundred thousand and said, “Now this is the last chance.” And he lost everything! He returned home. His wife asked, “What happened?”\nHe said, “I lost that last one too!”\nYou can lose only that which you had brought with you. Why talk about thousands? He said: “I have lost one rupee. It does not matter. That stake was unfortunate.” But he did not tell her that he had made one hundred thousand. He was right. You cannot lose that which does not belong to you. At the time of death you will find that you have lost the soul that you had brought with you. You will be deprived of ‘one’. That’s all! All your calculations of credit and debit, your losses and gains are of no value. The millions that you have won, will be dropped here at the time of your death. Only ‘one’ will be taken into account; and that one is – “YOU.” If you establish in the ‘one’, you are a winner. If you return to the ‘one’, settle in it... Shiva is talking about this very phenomenon: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH.\nYou are weak and wretched and miserable – not because you don’t have money or house or wealth. You are wretched and miserable because you are not established in yourself. To be established in oneself is the source of energy. The moment one is established in it, one is flooded with tremendous energy.\nSomeone asked Jesus: “What should I do? I am very poor, sickly and miserable. Jesus said,”Don’t do anything else, first seek the kingdom of God, all else will follow. If you lose ‘one’, you lose everything. That ‘one’ is none other than you, and that alone is your treasure because you had brought it with you. And in the final calculation you will be asked, whether you could save that which you brought with you or you have lost that, too!\nTO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH. To settle in oneself is to become immensely powerful. You already have that immense power within you, but you are like a bucket with thousands of holes. If you put the bucket in the well, it appears to be full. As long as the bucket is immersed in the water, it looks full; the moment you start pulling the bucket and it starts rising above the water- level, the water starts leaking through thousands of holes. When the bucket is drawn completely out of the well, there is nothing left inside.\nYour thousands of desires are your holes. Your energy dissipates through them. As long as you are dreaming, the bucket is full. As long as you desire, the bucket is full. The moment the desire becomes action, you start pulling the bucket up; the moment you try to make the dreams come true, the energy starts leaking. By the time you take the bucket out, you are faced with nothing but holes, with no water at all. You remain as thirsty as ever. Every time you draw the bucket, it makes lots of noise in the well. You feel you are getting some water, as if a great storm is coming. But nothing comes actually. You remain empty handed. However, desire is very strange.\nA traveler enquired of a fisherman how many fish he could catch. The sun was about to set, he had put his fishing rod in the water since morning. This passer by had passed through that road several times and had noticed it. At lost he could not contain himself, so he asked: “How many have you caught?” The fisherman answered: “If I catch this one I am trying to catch, and if I am able to catch\ntwo more, the total number will be three!” He has not caught a single one so far. But he is imagining: if I catch this one, plus two more – they will make three.\nYou are perpetually in the state of this fisherman. The one you are trying to catch, and two more you are dreaming about. Even this one has not materialized. But the calculation consists of three! And you are utterly pleased. Whenever you pull the bucket out, you again find it empty. And remember, the more you throw it in the well, the holes become wider and wider. This is the reason why children look very happy. Old people look very sad. Their bucket is full of holes. They have put the bucket in the well and drawn it out innumerable times. The holes have become bigger, that’s all! But they go on hoping against hope – some time we will be able to draw water because the bucket does look full! Water is leaking from the holes.\nYou have the energy of the infinite, but your mind is like a bucket with holes.\nThis maxim means: you will not go on a desire-trip. When you drop one desire, one hole is cemented. When all desires drop, all the holes are cemented. And then you don’t need to put the bucket in any well, you yourself are the well. You have tremendous energy within you. If only your energy could be prevented from leaking, you are born with tremendous energy. You don’t have to achieve anything. All that is worth achieving, is within you; be careful not to lose it. There is no question of attaining God, you have to avoid losing Him. You have already attained Him. How you lose, is the greatest mystery of this world.\nThe third maxim: DISCRIMINATION AND TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC IS A MEANS TO SELF- REALIZATION.\nEach and every maxim is like a master key. First: the sense of wonder. The sense of wonder will make you turn in. Second: To be established in oneself so that you are available to tremendous energy. But how will you settle in yourself? The key lies in the third maxim: Transcendental logic and discrimination is a means to self-realization.\nThis word: transcendental logic has to be understood. We know what logic is. It is an instrument of logic. It is a sword that cuts wonderment. Logic cuts, analyses. Logic moves outside, transcendental logic moves inside. It does not make fragments, it unites. Logic is analysis, transcendental logic is synthesis.\nThere was one Sufi monk, Farid. One of his devotees brought him a pair of scissors made of gold. It was very valuable, studded with precious stones. And he said, “It has been my family treasure for generations together. It costs millions of rupees. I have no use for it. I present it to you.”\nFarid said, “Please take it back. If at all you want to present something, bring a needle and a thread because I do not believe in cutting, I believe in sewing. A pair of scissors cuts. If you want to present something, better bring a needle and a thread.”\nLogic is like a pair of scissors; it cuts. In the Hindu mythology Ganesha is the god of logic; therefore he rides a rat. A rat is a pair of scissors. It cuts, it is a live pair of scissors. It goes on cutting. Ganesha rides it. He is a god of logic. And Hindus have made him a laughing stock. If his appearance does not make you laugh, it is a matter of surprise. You do not laugh because you have got used to his appearance, otherwise he is humorous figure.\nIf you take a close look at Ganesha’s structure, you will find that everything is shapeless in every way. Even his head does not belong to him, it is borrowed. A logician has a borrowed head. It is quite big, it’s an elephant’s head, but it is not his own. A borrowed head is useless, even if it belongs to the elephant. It will only make you look ugly. His body is bulky; rides a rat. This body of his is just a show-piece; his vehicle is a rat. However great a scholar may be, his vehicle is a rat – a pair of scissors: logic! Farid said it rightly, “If you want to present something, bring a needle and a thread because I believe in sewing.”\nTranscendental logic is an art of synthesizing. The Sanskrit word “VITARKA” means a special logic. Common logic analyses, special logic synthesizes. Buddha, Mahavir, Shiva, Lao Tzu – they all use logic, but it is a specialized logic.\nThere is one more kind of logic, which is a logical fallacy. There arr three possibilities. Logic fragments, analyses; but its intentions are not bad. The wonder has to be resolved. It is not interested in analyzing. Analysis is the process. It aims at achieving a doctrine which will dissolve the surprise, things will become crystal clear. The aim of logic is constructive.\nWhen logic has no goal, only scissoring becomes the aim, it enjoys being destructive, then it is called “KUTARKA” logical fallacy. It is an insane state of logic. It becomes mad, it is bent upon destroying. Then there is no other motive, destruction gives pleasure.\nVitatka, special logic is an inward journey of logic. You have come home from your house; your eyes, your vision, your direction was focussed on me, towards me. You turned your back to your home. When you will go back home, the road will be the same – in what way the road could be different? – only the direction will change. You will turn you back towards me and you will face your home.\nLogic and special logic tread the same road; that’s why it is called special logic. The road is the same, only the direction has changed. First logic was moving towards the other, towards the object; now the logic is moving towards the self, towards home. Just a change in the direction changes the total quality. When it had to move outwards, destruction was the way. If you want to enter the other, it could only be done by analyzing, there is no other way.\nIf you go to the medical college, you will find the students dissecting. They are dissecting the frog because they have to know what is inside. There is no other way, one can know the insides of a frog by dissecting. it. But if you have to enter within yourself, there is no need to dissect. You are present inside! If you want to know the other, you will have to dissect him, destroy him because there is no other way of knowing him. If you want to know yourself, there is no question of dissecting or destroying because you are already there! If you want to know yourself, just closing your eyes is enough. Closing one’s eyes is meditation. When the attention is withdrawn from outside and focussed inside, logic becomes transcendental.\nThe other name for vitark is vivek, or consciousness. It really means awareness. This awareness is a process of synthesis. As you go within you, you start becoming integrated. For example: imagine a circle with a wide circumference. Now take two points, far apart on the circumference. Join each to the point at the center of the circle. You will find that as the lines approach the center, they come closer and closer to each other, until they are one at the center. Now if these two lines are extended further outside the circumference, they will be further and further apart, until the distance between them becomes infinite.\nIn the same way, when you move outwards from yourself, things begin to fall apart, and the further you go the greater becomes the difference between them. Therefore, we find many different branches of science because the distance is becoming bigger and bigger. New theories are born every day, and scientists are facing a dilemma: one science cannot understand the language of the other. There is no such person on earth who can understand all the sciences, who can synthesize the different branches of science.\nAs it is, it is impossible to know a single branch of science. There is no dearth of knowledge in the world, but we have lost the power of synthesis. Religion is one, no matter how many names you give it, because no sooner does a man begin to go within himself than the distances decrease, and all things merge into the center. The center is the ultimate synthesis.\nVitark or vivek, intelligence or awareness, discrimination leads to self-realization. Do not dissect things. Do not go outwards; do not pay attention to ‘the other’. Direct your attention inwards; synthesize! Move slowly towards the center, where your life-force is focussed. Become established at this point and great energy will arise within you.\nThe light we see around Mahavir or Buddha, the bliss we find around Krishna, Meera, Chaitanya – what bliss is this? What light is it? What does it signify? It indicates that these people have reached the point which is the source of infinite energy. They are no longer miserable, they are no longer poor. They are emperors in their own right. This is also your potential, but you have to proceed step by step.\nFirst comes a sense of wonder; then being centered in the self; then intelligence as a way of reaching the self.\nThe fourth sutra:\nTO ENJOY THE BLISS OF EXISTENCE IS SAMADHI.\nWhen you have reached the self and are firmly established in it, you have reached the most profound state of existence. Existence is at its greatest density at this point, for everything is created out of here. Your center is not only your center but the center of all creation.\nWe are separated only at the circumference. ‘You’ and ‘I’ are separations of the body. As we leave the body and turn within, the distance gets smaller and smaller. The day you know the soul you will also have known God. The day you know your own self you will know the self of all creation, because at the center all is one. Distances only exist at the periphery.\nShiva says: By attaining this existence within one’s self, the joy of samadhi is attained.\nSamadhi-sukham, the ‘bliss of samadhi’; these words should be understood. You have known many joys: the joy of a good dinner, the joy of good health and well-being. When you quench your thirst or enjoy sex – such bodily joys you know fully, but understand well that all these joys carry complementary sorrows with them. If you are not thirsty, water will bring no joy. If you are prepared to undergo the torment of thirst, only then will you enjoy drinking water. The affliction, the agony, comes first and is long; the ensuing joy is only momentary. As soon as the water slides down the\nthroat the thirst is quenched. The same is true with food. The more you suffer the pangs of hunger, the tastier is the food.\nThis is the irony of life; the people who are tormented by hunger, who could really enjoy the pleasures of eating, have nothing to eat. Those who do not know what hunger is, have plenty to eat, but they cannot enjoy their food; on the contrary, it is a source of distress for them.\nAs long as there is thirst in you, water can quench it; but you can live a kind of life in which you never feel thirsty; do not go in the sun, do no manual work, stay at home and relax and you will not feel the thirst. But then you will find no joy in drinking water. He who toils all day, enjoys the bliss of a good night’s rest. This is ironical: if you want to enjoy the pleasure of a good night’s sleep you have to work like a laborer all day. The trouble is that you want to spend your days like an emperor and your nights like a laborer.\nIn the external world, in the world of objects, joy and sorrow are intrinsically connected; therefore, the day you acquire a mansion, sleep will desert you. The day you obtain a feather bed you will find yourself tossing in your sleep all night. Look at the laborer; he sleeps under a tree on top of stones and pebbles. He sleeps like a log. Mosquitos bite him; he is so hot that his body is soaked with perspiration, but he is oblivious to it all. He has gone through such intense misery all through the day that he has earned the joy that he will have in the night.\nWe have to pay for our joy and comfort with toil and troubles in this world. Here each joy is connected with an equivalent sorrow. And human being is entangled in one dilemma: he wants to keep the joy and get rid of the sorrow. But this is impossible. We have been trying for thousands of years that the sorrow should be eliminated and the joy should be saved. But we have not been successful in our efforts. The sorrow is certainly eliminated, but at the same time the joy is reduced proportionately. We resent sorrow and desire joy. Hence the problem.\nWhat is the meaning of the ‘joy of samadhi’? That which has no sorrow attached to it. The bliss of samadhi is not quenching any thirst, it is not filling an empty stomach, nor is it the weariness after a hard day’s work. The bliss of samadhi is not connected with sorrow and toil. This is the difference between spiritual joy and worldly joys. THE BLISS OF SAMADHI IS THE BLISS OF SIMPLY EXISTING. No desire, no longing or craving, is connected with it. It is simply the ‘joy of being’.\nTherefore Shiva speaks of the ‘bliss of existence’, lokananda. That you are – that in itself is a great bliss! It has nothing to do with desires and pain etc. Remember, the soul suffers from no hunger and no thirst; hence the question of hunger and thirst and the pleasure gained out of their satiation does not arise. All thirsts and hungers belong to the body, so when a person desires the pleasures of the body he should also be prepared for the pains. The more he is prepared to go through the pains and suffering, the more happiness he attains. The joy of the soul is the purest of joys. There is no place for sorrow here. But this occurs only at the center. At the circumference you are the body.\nThe body is the periphery. It is the surrounding wall of your vessel; it is not you. It is your outer circle. At the center you are the soul, and it is here that a completely new kind of joy unfolds itself. Here the joy is the joy of being – just being. There is no peak of happiness and abyss of misery here: no ups and downs; no gain or loss, no night or day, no toil or rest. Only you are there. There\nyou become eternal, and this state of being eternal is filled with joy. It is overflowing. Its juice never dries up. Therefore saints call it ‘eternal’, everlasting, always new.\nKabir says: the juice of nectar flows incessantly unhindered, without any variation. It rains in this world, too, but the rains must be preceded by heat.\nWhen the summer heat reaches its peak – when there are cracks in the earth, when the trees start wailing, when the heat becomes unbearable all over – then the rains come. We may ask: Why this absurd law? Why can there not be rains without all this suffering? But then we have to understand the whole system of nature, the mathematics of nature. The clouds are formed only when the heat becomes suffocating, for water then turns into vapor. There will be no rains if there is no evaporation. The vapor rises and forms clouds, and when the clouds are over-saturated – so much that they can’t help showering, it starts raining. So unbearable heat is prerequisite for a good rainy season.\nIn the world of the soul there are no opposites, no duality. Therefore it is referred to as ‘non-dual’ or indivisible. Here there is only one, not two. But then it becomes difficult for you to understand what kind of joy this is, for you know of no joy without its ensuing pain.\nSomeone asked Sigmund Freud for a definition of madness. How do people become insane? Freud’s answer was wonderful and very strange. He said, “Success and madness have a common definition. The path to success is the path to insanity.” When you want to succeed, you become tense; when you want to succeed, you fight. Your days and nights are filled with anxiety. When you want to succeed, your each and every moment is overshadowed with fear: will you succeed or won’t you? What if you don’t? You are not alone. There are thousands of competitors. Night and day you are in a state of acute tension, and this is exactly the prescription for losing your sanity! So carefully observe the people you call successful; you will notice that they live in the same state of constant restlessness, tension and anxiety that the madmen live in.\nWhen Krushchev was in power in Russia he went to inspect a mental hospital. While he was at the hospital he remembered an important message, so he rang up his office, but the girl at the switchboard paid no attention. There was a reason why she ignored him, which became clear later. Finally he was fed up. He shouted, “Young lady, do you know who I am?” This is common to all those who are successful, who are in power and have money – inwardly this thought is incessantly echoing in his mind: do you know, who I am? He may not speak loudly but inside, he is saying it over and over again. This is the reason why he has staked everything. At last he could not contain himself and said to the girl, “Do you know who I am ? I am Krushchev, the prime minister.”\nThe girl said, “I do not know who you are, but I know where you are calling from – the mental hospital.”\nNow the fact is, all the prime ministers speak from the same place. There is no other place for them to speak from.\nOnce Krushchev went to London where he was given a very costly piece of cloth. The cloth was so expensive that he wanted the best tailor of the world to stitch it. He asked the best tailor of Moscow. He wanted to make a coat and pant, complete with waistcoat. The Russian tailor said the cloth was not sufficient for a three-piece suit. He could only make a two-piece suit. The material was so\nexpensive that Krushchev wanted three pieces to be made. He took the cloth to London. There he was told that he could easily get a three-piece suit for enough cloth left over to make something for his child also.\nKrushchev was shocked. He asked, how his own Russian tailor could be so dishonest? He said, only two pieces can be made. The London tailor answered, “Don’t be angry with him. In Russia you are a very big man. Here in London you are next to nothing.”\nWhen a man sets out to surround himself with pleasures of success and ambition, he will have to endure suffering and hardship exactly equal to the pleasure he pursues, and this hardship and suffering break him completely. Long before he can experience any feeling of success, he has almost become unsuccessful. In this world no one can be successful because the price for success is terrible madness, insanity. And by the time success knocks on your door, you are not in a position to enjoy it.\nThe pleasure of samadhi is entirely different. You do not have to pay the price for it, for what you set out to find is present now – at this very moment. It is not somewhere in the future, so that you have to sat out on a quest and toil and labour. It is present here and now. You possess it already. This treasure is your birthright, you don’t have to pay the price of suffering in order to get it. In that case one wonders, what would be it like?\nWhatever joy you have known cannot compare with, or even give you an inkling, of this joy, for all your joys are mixed with sorrows. All the nectar you have known has been mixed with poison. With the body this is bound to be; birth and death, nectar and poison are side by side. Each worldly joy carries its counterpart of pain. But the soul is only immortal. There is no death for the soul; it is eternal. There are no opposites; there is only existence, pure existence.\nPerhaps, if you could visualize your physical pleasures without their pain and bitterness, just drop the bitter taste lingering in your mouth and you might be able to imagine this happiness or something like it; but this would be only a glimpse. It cannot give you a clear picture. The circumference can only give you a glimpse. No matter how much you contemplate, you cannot imagine or conceptualize that which you have never experienced. You have to experience it first.\nThese sutras are invaluable. Be filled with wonder. Turn towards the self. Become centered in your being so that great energy will be at your disposal. Let life be yours – the supreme life. Attain self- knowledge through intelligence – through awareness, the supreme awareness – and by breaking through your slumber you shall enjoy the bliss of existence. The bliss of samadhi is yours for the asking.\nSomething more about the bliss of samadhi: worldly joy depends on very many factors. It depends in your capability and incapability, your education or non-education, your strength, your natural gifts, your relations, your connections – it depends on all these and more. You are not alone there. If you are born to a poor household you will take longer to achieve your goal, perhaps a whole life-time. If you are born into a wealthy family it may take you less time. If you are clever, cunning, intelligent, you will reach early. If you are dull and stupid you will wander a great deal; it is doubtful whether you will reach at all. If the body is unhealthy or diseased it is difficult; if the body is healthy you are better equipped. So everything is accidental and depends on a thousand and one things.\nThe bliss of samadhi does not depend on anything, it is unconditional. It depends neither on your intellect nor on your body. It makes no difference whether you are worthy or unworthy, nor does it depend on your family, your education, your looks or your sex, or your casts or your religion or your age. It is absolutely unconditional joy because it is your very own treasure. It is within you already. You are born with it. It is only that you have not paid attention to it; that is all. You have merely forgotten it, not lost it. Just turn your eyes; look back and take a look at yourself.\nIt is not that a clever person will attain more bliss of samadhi and a dull person less. This is not at all the case. Even illiterate people reach there. Kabir, who was illiterate, unlettered, reached where Buddha reached. And when both reach, there is not an iota of difference between the two. The bliss of samadhi is the very nature of existence. Whether you are fair or dark on your periphery, ugly or beautiful, healthy or unhealthy – whether your brain is filled with the words of various doctrines or not – all of this does not matter at all. Your being is sufficient. That you exist is enough.\nTherefore, all meditation is a quest to become pure. When you forget the body, forget the mind, then you will begin to attain the joy of existence, the bliss of samadhi. Just try to do one thing: try to forget the body and the mind for some time. As soon as they are forgotten you begin to remember the soul. As long as you are aware of body and mind you cannot remember the soul. The mind and body are on the periphery, whereas the soul is at the center. You cannot look at both of them at the same time.\nIn this meditation camp if you could forget the body and mind for a little while you will gain the taste of the bliss of samadhi. Once you get the taste, that is enough. Your life will take a different turn. It is the initial taste that is difficult. Once you know, once you have turned within and seen, then you know the trick. Then whenever you turn you will see. All the effort is needed in this initial turning in.\nOnce the key is in your hands, you are the master. Then you can taste this pleasure at will. You may wander fearlessly in the world now, and nobody can steal your treasure. Wherever you are, you may be a shopkeeper attending your customer, this bliss is with you and you experience it. One thing will start happening: you will stop seeking worldly pleasures. When the supreme joy is attained who cares about trivial pleasure? When diamonds and rubies are in your hands who will hold on to colored stones? They will drop by themselves; you need not renounce them.\nFor this reason I always say that a wise person renounces nothing; that which is useless, falls away by itself. Ignorant people renounce because renunciation is very painful for them. They have no knowledge of what is meaningful, and they are busy renouncing the meaningless. But the mind clings. The mind says: You are leaving what is in your hands, and how can you trust that which is not yet in your grasp? Besides, who even knows whether it exists or not?\nSo I tell you to give up nothing. I only tell you to have one taste of the bliss of samadhi. This simple taste will become the supreme renunciation in your life. Then you will know for yourself what is useless and once we know a thing to be useless, we feel no misgivings about letting go of it. Then it falls on its own.\nThere was a great saint of Bengal, Yukteshwar Giri. He was known as a great renunciate. A wealthy person once came to him and said, “You are a great renunciate.”\nGiri laughed out loud. “Look at him!” he said, pointing to the man. “Look at him! He is a great renunciate himself, and he is calling me one. Don’t try to trap me with your words, my good man!”\nEveryone was shocked, even his disciples. They begged him to explain because there was no doubt that Giri was a great renunciate. Giri said, “Suppose there is a pile of diamonds and a pile of pebbles. This man holds on the pebbles, while I hold on the diamonds! And he thinks I am a renunciate!”\nWho has renounced, Mahavir or you, Buddha or you? You have renounced, for you hold on to rubbish. You have discarded the joy of samadhi in favor of the anxiety-ridden affairs of the periphery, and what have you got in exchange for your bliss is so flimsy. So coarse and crude! So stale and dirty!\nThe worldly man is a great renunciate, but he thinks the sannyasin is the renunciate. In fact, worldly men look at sannyasins with pity: “Poor things, they have left everything. They have missed all of life’s pleasures.”\nThey revere sannyasins and deep down pity them, too: “Poor things! They have renounced everything without enjoying anything. At least some things they should have enjoyed!” But worldly man have no ideas whom they are talking about. The sannyasin has experienced the greatest enjoyment. He has been invited by the vast existence to partake of the greatest of all enjoyments.\nI do not ask you to give up anything. I only ask you to know, to taste. This very taste then will slowly displace all that is useless and trivial in your life. The useless just falls away; it needs to be renounced.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"12023","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_path/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_path/>The Great Path</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 Maxims of Yoga: A sense of wonder</h1><div class=post-meta>57 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;12023 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Path/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is in the process of being edited. It is for research only.]</p><p><br></p><p>A SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA. TO BE ESTABLISHED IN
ONESELF IS STRENGTH. A TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC IS A MEANS TO
SELF-REALIZATION. TO ENJOY THE BLISSFULNESS OF THE EXISTENCE IS
ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>A SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand this.</p><p><br></p><p>In the dictionary, “wonder” means astonishment. But there is a basic
difference between wonder and astonishment. If you fail to understand
this basic difference, you may embark on a different journey altogether.
Astonishment is the foundation of science, a sense of wonder is that of
yoga. Astonishment is extrovert; wonder is introvert. Astonishment is
about the other; wonder is about our own self. This is the first
point.</p><p><br></p><p>Wonder is born out of that which we cannot understand, which makes us
speechless, which our intellect cannot grasp, which proves to be bigger
than us, before whom we are suddenly dumfounded – which destroys us.</p><p><br></p><p>If the same state of wonder – which is born when we are faced with
the illogical, the incomprehensible – is diverted towards the external
objects, it gives birth to science. When we start thinking about matter,
when we start contemplating the world and try to investigate that
mystery that</p><p>surrounds us all, science is created. Science is born out of
astonishment. Astonishment means, it has embarked on the outward
journey.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one more difference between wonder and astonishment: if we
are surprised by something, sooner or later we will be fed up with that
surprise, because surprise creates tension; hence the effort of
destroying that which surprises us. Science is born out of this
surprise. Then it destroys the surprise. It tries to find
interpretations, doctrines, formulas, keys and it does not rest assured
till it destroys the mystery, till it is in possession of knowledge,
till science can claim: “Yes, I have understood!”</p><p><br></p><p>Science is bent upon eradicating the element of astonishment from the
world. If it succeeds in achieving that, there will not be a single
thing on earth that man cannot boast of not knowing. It means, this
world will be godless, because God means that which we cannot claim to
know even if we have known him. We may know him but he remains
unknowable. We may go on deepening our knowledge of him, he cannot be
exhausted. We are in the state of eternal wonder about him.</p><p><br></p><p>There are some objects which have become known to us. We can call
them, the known. There are some other objects which we do not know but
we will know them. Let us call them, the unknown. And the existence also
consists of such objects which we have never known and about which we
will never be able to know. We will call them, the unknowable. God is
unknowable. This is the third element. Science does not accept God
because it says that nothing is unknowable in the world. We may have not
known it up to now, maybe we did not try hard enough, but sooner or
later we will know. Some day we will know the world completely; nothing
will remain unknown in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Science is born out of astonishment and then it begins to destroy the
astonishment. Therefore, I call science patricidal: it tries to kill
that which created it. Religion is just the opposite. Religion is also
born out of a certain astonishment; this sutra calls it, “sense of
wonder.” The only difference is: when a religious seeker is filled with
wonder, he does not set out on the outer journey, he goes on an inner
pilgrimage. Whenever some kind of mystery envelops him, he starts
thinking about himself: I must know who I am.</p><p><br></p><p>If the mystery becomes introspective, and the search and the journey
is directed inwards, the arrow of the seeking points towards the self,
the attention is totally absorbed by the thirst to know our own reality
– then it is wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second point to be understood is that the sense of wonder is
inexhaustible. The more we know, the more it increases. That’s why
wonder is contradictory. As a rule, the sense of wonder should disappear
the moment we come to know something. But Buddha or Krishna or Shiva or
Christ do not lose their sense of wonder. When they attain the ultimate
consciousness, their sense of wonder becomes ultimate! At that time they
do not say that they have known everything, they say that after knowing
everything everything remains to be known.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads have said, “Even if you extract the whole from the
whole, the whole remains.” Even if you know the whole, the whole remains
to be known. Therefore spiritual knowledge does not nourish the ego,
scientific knowledge nourishes the ego. Spiritual knowledge will never
make you a knower; you will always remain humble. And the more you know,
the more you will feel, “I do not know anything.” At the highest peak of
knowledge you will be able to say, “I know nothing.” At the moment of
ultimate knowledge the whole existence fills you with a sense of
wonder.</p><p>If science succeeds, the whole world will become known; if religion
succeeds, the whole world will become unknown. If science is victorious,
you, the knower, will be full of ego and the world will become ordinary
because where there is no sense of wonder, everything becomes prosaic;
where there is no wonder, there is no spirit; if there is no possibility
of mystery, the process of evolution comes to a dead end. The thirst for
knowledge has vanished, curiosity has died.</p><p><br></p><p>If science has its way, the world will be filled with such boredom as
it has never experienced before. If Westerners are more bored, science
has to blame for that, because people are losing their capacity to feel
wonder. They are not amazed by anything. They have forgotten to be
amazed. If you put a problem before them which has no solution, they
will say, “Oh! It can be solved!” – because according to science,
basically, there is nothing that can remain unknown forever; it can be
unveiled.</p><p><br></p><p>The religious journey is, however, paradoxical. The more we unveil,
the more we find that the mystery goes on deepening. The nearer you
come, the more you come to know: it is very difficult to know. And the
moment we penetrate the very center of the existence, everything becomes
mysterious. For the Buddha, the stones and pebbles lying on the ground
are as mysterious as the twinkling stars high up in the sky: It is not
only the enormous that appears to be mysterious, the smallest happening
holds the same mystery for him. A seed sprouting in the soil is as
mysterious as the creation of the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>So, as the sense of wonder becomes intense, your eyes will become
like those of a small child. A child is wonderstruck by everything.
Watch a child walking on the street – everything surprises him. A
colored stone looks like a diamond. You laugh at him because you are the
knower; you know that it is colored stone. You tell him, “Don’t be
crazy, this is not a diamond.” But the child wants to put it in his
pocket. You will say, “Don’t carry this burden. After all, it’s a dirty
stone lying in the mud. Throw it away!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the child grips it harder. You are not able to understand it. It
is a wonder for the child. This colored stone is in no way less valuable
than the diamond. The value lies in the sense of wonder. Stones are of
no value. A tiny butterfly can mesmerize the child immensely, but you
will not be mesmerized by the almighty himself even if he comes to see
you! The child starts chasing the butterfly.…</p><p><br></p><p>The highest state of wonder, of buddhahood is just like the innocence
of a small child. One becomes childlike in that state. That’s why Jesus
has said: Those who are like small children will be able to enter the
kingdom of God. Jesus is saying the same thing that Shiva has said in
this sutra: the sense of wonder is the foundation of yoga. Wonder is the
first stage of yoga. In that case you have to understand many
things.</p><p><br></p><p>The more knowledgeable you are, the weaker will be the foundation of
yoga. If you are full of the pride of knowing, the chances of your
becoming a yogi are less. If your heart is burdened with the scriptures,
your sense of wonder will be destroyed. You ask a scholar about God, and
he starts answering as if God is a thing to be made an answer of... as
if God can be explained. You ask a scholar and he has a readymade
answer. No sooner did you ask than the answer was given. Even God does
not make him speechless. All the formulas are definite, he explains them
instantaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>But you go to the Buddha and ask about God, he does not say anything.
Perhaps you will go back thinking that this man remained silent, and the
meaning is clear: he does not know. But the reason</p><p>why this man remained silent is that this sense of wonder is the door
to the divine. Had you been a little wiser, you would have remained with
the man who did not answer. And you would have tried to understand him:
you would have peeped into his eyes; you would have lived in his
company, in his proximity because he has experienced something, and the
experience is so immense that words cannot express it; he has seen
something that cannot become an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Questions and answers are alright for the school-children. Your
question in itself is absurd. One cannot ask a question about God. How
can one ask a question about the infinite? Both the question and the
answer drop by themselves before the infinite. Your question is petty,
that’s why Buddha has remained silent. But maybe you will come back
thinking that had this man known, he would have answered. He did not
answer, that means he did not know. You recognize a scholar because your
head is full of words, too. You will not be able to understand a sage
because a sage is full of wonder. And your sense of wonder is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest calamity of the world is: destruction of wonder. The day
your sense of wonder is destroyed, your possibility of liberation is
destroyed. The day your sense of wonder is dead, your childlike heart is
dead, frozen. You have become old.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you still amazed? Does life pose a question to you? Are you
thrilled by the chirping of the birds, the sound of the running streams,
the wind rustling through the trees? Do you feel joy? Does this life
surrounding you everywhere makes you speechless? No, because you know
that birds are making these sounds and wind is rustling through the
trees – you have answer to every question. These answers have killed
you. You have become knowledgeable before attaining knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>A SENSE OF WONDER IS THE FOUNDATION OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>A sense of wonder becomes a door for one who wants to enter yoga.
Revive your childhood! Start asking again. Awaken your curiosity, your
quest and the roots of life that have dried in you will start greening
again. All the blocks will melt away and streams will start running.
Open your eyes and look all around once again – all answers are false,
because all your answers are borrowed. You have not known anything. But
you are stuffed with borrowed knowledge, to the extent that you feel,
you known it.</p><p><br></p><p>Awaken your sense of wonder. Your yoga-postures and breath-exercises
are useless if there is no sense of wonder within you – because all the
yogic exercises belong to the body. It’s true that your body will be
purified, healthy but purified and healthy body will not help you to
attain divinity.</p><p><br></p><p>A sense of wonder purifies the heart. Wonder means: the mind is free
of all answers. Wonder means: you have removed all the garbage of
answers. Your question has become new, rejuvenated; you have understood
your ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>Wonder means: I do not know. Scholarship means: I know.</p><p>The more you know, the more you are wrong. When you are simple enough
to say: “I don’t know” – although this too is not sufficient – when the
understanding of your own ignorance settles deep into</p><p>your heart, you have taken the first step of yoga. After that, other
steps are very easy. If you miss the first step, you may go on traveling
endlessly, it will be of no use. One who misses the first step cannot
reach the destination. If your first step is right, half of the distance
is covered.</p><p><br></p><p>A sense of wonder is the first step.</p><p><br></p><p>Look closely, do you possess knowledge? If you observe deeply, you
will realize that there is no knowledge, just garbage collected from
scriptures, masters, saints and you have preserved it like a priceless
possession! It has not given you anything, it has only killed your sense
of wonder. Your sense of wonder is writhing, lying dead. Now you are not
surprised. Nothing surprises you any more.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a Christian mystic, Eckhart. He has made a unique
statement: one who is surprised by everything is a saint. Everything,
very small happenings surprise him. A pebble falls in the water, creates
noise, ripples start spreading – the saint is amazed. It is so wondrous,
so mysteriousness! He breathes, lives, it is quite amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>Every morning while praying to God Eckhart used to say, “It is
another day! The sun has risen again. Thy mercy is great. What would we
do if the sun would not have arisen? Human being is helpless.” Eckhart
used to say, “Today I am breathing, tomorrow I may not; what can I
do?”</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot draw breath from somewhere. It is not in your control.
Breath is so close to you, and yet you do not own it. If it goes out and
does not return, it will just return! We do not know or possess a thing
which is so close to you. And we think that we know everything. This
‘knowing everything’ has killed you. Remove this garbage and unburden
yourself. Immediately, when the blindfold of knowledge will be removed
from your eyes, they will be filled with mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>The inner pilgrimage of this mystery is called wonder; the outward
journey is called astonishment. If you apply those mysteries to objects,
you will become a scientist and if you are able to apply that mystery to
your own self, you will become a great yogi. And in both the cases the
results will be different, because astonishment is violent, sense of
wonder is nonviolent. Surprise applied anywhere, starts disintegrating,
analyzing because surprise is restless, wonder is full of interest. Try
to understand this difference properly. It is not written in the
dictionary; it cannot be written because the compiler of the dictionary
has no idea what wonder is.</p><p><br></p><p>Astonishment is violent, aggressive. When you are astonished by
something, you become tense. That tension has to be dealt with. A
certain restlessness will hang over you as long as your enquiry is not
complete, you have not known. A scientist is engrossed in his laboratory
eighteen hours a day... what for? He is restless, as if possessed by a
ghost. And he will keep on investigating till he resolves it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the sense of wonder is not aggressive. And the sense of wonder is
not a restlessness, on the contrary the sense of wonder is restfulness.
Whenever someone is filled with wonderment one is at rest. You don’t
have to destroy the sense of wonder, you have to drink it, you have to
taste it. You have to merge with wonder, you have to become one with it.
Astonishment is involved in destruction, wonder begins to live. Wonder
is a way of life, astonishment is a violent state of mind.</p><p>So science thinks in terms of victory – destroy, shatter, win.
Religion thinks in terms of surrender – dissolve yourself. When the
sense of wonder will enter you, it will dissolve in you the same way a
salt-cube is dropped into water and the whole water turns salty. That
day you will become salty with wonder. Every fibre will be filled with
wonder. While walking, moving around the sense of wonder will be
pulsating within you. You will be in a perpetual state of wonder. Every
phenomenon will become mysterious. The smallest particle will be a part
of the vast, because the sense of wonder envelops the small, it becomes
vast. Then nothing remains known, you are surrounded by mystery. Then
every moment is new and every moment is an invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was contesting the elections. While he was on his
door-to-door campaign, he went to the local priest. Even at that time he
was drunk. The priest was a gentleman; saying something directly would
have been impolite so he said to Nasruddin, “I want to ask you
something. If you give me a satisfying answer, my vote is all yours. Do
you ever drink?” There was no need to ask about it. Mulla was taken
aback. He said, “Before I answer your question, I would like to ask you
something: Is it an enquiry or an invitation?”</p><p><br></p><p>The sense of wonder is an invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Astonishment is an enquiry and sense of wonder, invitation. The sense
of wonder is an internal call. And as you enter inside, you go on
immersing deeper and deeper. One day you will disappear and only wonder
will remain. That day enlightenment has happened. If you follow the path
of astonishment, one day only you will remain and astonishment will
disappear. That is the culmination of science: ego will remain and
astonishment will vanish. If you embark on the journey of wonder, you
will vanish and wonder will remain, every pore of your being will be
filled with its taste. Your existence itself will be a wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva has called it the foundation of yoga. Remove knowledge, become
full of wonder. In the beginning it will appear difficult because you
think that you know.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great thinker, a very invaluable, important one: D. H.
Lawrence. He was roaming in the garden with a small child. The child
asked him, “Why are the trees green?”</p><p><br></p><p>A child can only ask such questions – so fresh! You cannot even think
of such questions. You will say, “The trees are green because they are
green! What is there to ask? What kind of a question is this? This child
is stupid. But think again, why the trees are green. Do you really know
the answer? Perhaps someone studying science may answer,”It is the
chlorophyll that makes them green.” But it will not resolve the question
of the child. It will ask again, “Why is there chlorophyll in the tree?
Why should it be in the tree and why not in the man? And how the
chlorophyll has found the trees? The answer”chlorophyll” does not
(answer?) any question.</p><p><br></p><p>All the answers found by science are of the same category. Those
answers only push the question one step back, that’s all. If you are a
little wise, you can raise the question again. Science cannot answer any
“why.” That’s why science cannot destroy the sense of wonder, it can
only create an illusion of destroying it.</p><p><br></p><p>But D. H. Lawrence was not a scientist. He was a poet, a novelist. He
had an aesthetic sense. He stopped then and there and started thinking.
He said to the child, “Give me some time. I don’t know myself.”</p><p>Your child also must have asked many a time the same kinds of
question. Have you ever said: “I don’t know?” It hurts the ego. Every
father thinks that he knows. The child asks and the father gives an
answer. And because of these very answers the father loses his
credibility later on, because one day the child comes to know that you
know nothing. You were unnecessarily giving answers. You are as ignorant
as I am. You were a little older so your ignorance was older, that’s
all. But you give answers to the small child. The child, too, accepts
them thinking you may be right. But how long will he believe it?</p><p><br></p><p>D.H. Lawrence stood there. He said, “I will think over it. And if you
go on insisting, I can only say that the trees are green because they
are green. There is no other answer. I am myself overwhelmed by this
mystery.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you unveil the curtain of knowledge, you will find mystery all
around. It is a mystery that the trees are green. It is also mysterious
that the green trees have red flowers. And isn’t it mysterious that a
small seed contains a giant tree in its womb? You preserve a seed and
plant it after thousands of years, the tree materializes. Life seems to
be eternal. Every moment is throbbing with mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have closed your eyes. You rest assured. But this state is
your inertia. You do not even hesitate, for the simple reason that your
ego feels a reassurance that it knows. If you know, you feel secure; if
you do not know, all security disappears. Actually you do not know
anything but it hurts to admit that you do not know. So you cling to
anything. A drowning man clings to a straw, takes its support. The thing
you are clinging to is not even a straw. Perhaps a straw may save
someone from drowning but the thing you are clinging to is not even a
straw, it is just a dream, empty words.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone strongly believes in God. It is absurd to say that I
definitely know. ‘Definitely’ means, now you have unraveled the mystery
of God! ‘Definitely’ means you have seen through Him, you have measured
Him. ‘Definitely’ means: even He can be measured, you have weighed Him
in the balance, you have investigated in the laboratory. What is the
meaning ‘definite’?</p><p><br></p><p>There is another man who definitely knows that God does not exist.
Both are stupid and both of them have the same disease. One calls
himself theist, another one calls himself atheist; and there is not an
iota of difference between the two. Deep down both suffer from the same
disease. Both of them believe that they know and both get into
arguments.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge creates argument, wonder creates dialogue. When you are
filled with wonder, your life will have a dialogue. If somebody goes to
Mahavira and asks: “Does God exist?” He says, “Yes.” Some atheist goes
and says, “God does not exist,” and he says, “No, he does not.” And if
some agnostic goes to him, Mahavira says, “God’s existence is
dubious.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it is very difficult. We would want him to give straight and
clear answers. They may be wrong, but they should be clear. And
remember, this existence is so complex that clear answers will prove
wrong. Here, if the answer is not contradictory, it is bound to be
wrong. Here, only that answer will be right which encompasses its
opposite because existence absorbs its opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>There is life and there is death. The path is not clear-cut. Here
darkness exists along with light. Good and evil exist together. Here the
saint and the sinner are not separate, they are living simultaneously.
Both are two aspects of the same coin. God contains both the poles
within Him. Existence is vast. It is not chiseled on the touchstone of
logic, it is beyond logic. The duality is merged into each other.</p><p>One night Junnaid prayed to God: “I want to know who is the greatest
sinner in this village because by studying him, by understanding him I
will try to abstain from the sin. I will have a criterion that here is
the greatest sinner, I have to avoid this kind of life.” A voice said,
“Your neighbor.” Junnaid was surprised. He had never imagined that his
neighbor could be the greatest sinner. He was an ordinary man, running
his own small shop, how can he be the greatest sinner? He had thought
that the greatest sinner will be someone like Ravana [a mythological
character who represents devil], the greatest sinner will be someone
devilish, a satan. This man is running a shop, rearing his children.…
Junnaid was perplexed. He was an ordinary man, nobody would call him a
sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Next day while praying he said, “O.K., I accept your decision. Now I
want one more criterion: I want to know about the greatest saint, a
virtuous man in the village.” God said, “The same man, your
neighbor.”</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “You are confusing me. There is already great confusion
in me. Yesterday I was watching the man all day, I did not feel that he
was a sinner. Now this adds to the confusion: he is a virtuous man,
too!”</p><p><br></p><p>The voice said, “In my existence the opposites are interlinked. It is
the intellect that splits them into two. Here the greatest saint has a
shadow. And here the greatest sinner has a glow on his face. This very
phenomenon makes it possible for a saint to become a sinner and a sinner
to become a saint. This transformation is possible so easily because
both are hidden in one person.</p><p><br></p><p>Darkness and light are not separate. Day and night are interrelated.
Logic creates fragments and makes clear-cut paths. Logic is like a
well-made, clean, cultivated garden. Life is like a forest; nothing is
clear in it. Everything is entangled there.</p><p><br></p><p>One who wants to understand life should have the capacity to avoid
readymade answers. If you cling to them, you feel secure because you
feel reassured: Yes, I know! You feel confident and courageous enough to
tread the path of life. That’s why you are afraid of dropping knowledge.
It is very painful. If someone robs you of your wealth, it does not
matter so much. You can earn it again. And wealth was dirt. You knew
that already. If you lose your position, you can take it in your stride.
You yourself can renounce it some day. But knowledge...!</p><p><br></p><p>I have observed a very interesting phenomenon. Somebody renounces his
society, his village, his house, his family but if he was Jaina he
remains a Jaina in the Himalayas; if he was a Hindu he remains a Hindu;
if he was a Mohammedan he remains a Mohammedan. It is the same society
that he has renounced, that had given him this Mohammedan conditioning:
that Koran is a true scripture, all other scriptures are false. He gives
up everything but saves his knowledge even in the Himalayas. Nothing has
changed in this man’s life because he still believes in knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>If you drop knowledge, the Himalayas will appear wherever you are.
The Himalayas will appear wherever you are. The Himalayas signify that
which is mysterious; where there are high mountain peaks, you cannot
scale them; and where there are unfathomable valleys, you will not be
able to explore them; which transcends all our measures.</p><p><br></p><p>The sense of wonder means: where your intellect fails, where your ego
is crippled, where you become helpless. You may laugh or cry there but
you cannot utter a word.</p><p>It is said that when Moses reached the mountain Sanai, he cried, he
laughed but he did not speak at all. When he returned, his disciples
asked: “What have you done? God was present himself. He said unto you,
‘Remove you shoes because this is holy land and I am present here.’ And
you removed your shoes. You cried, you laughed but why didn’t you say
something? Why did you miss this opportunity? You could have asked
whatever you wanted to ask. You could have at least asked for the key
that opens all the doors.”</p><p><br></p><p>Moses replied, “When He was present in front of me, my mind
disappeared; only heart was throbbing. I laughed, I cried out of sheer
joy!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the interesting part of life – happiness can make you cry
and happiness can make you laugh, too. So do not think that people
always cry out of grief. It is a calculation of logic. Life does not
believe in logic. The river of life breaks all the frontiers and
overflows like a total wave. One can cry out of happiness. Then one’s
tears have a different quality. Then bliss is reflected in the tears. He
can cry, too! These opposites can express one principle. This is the
mystery of life.</p><p><br></p><p>So Moses said, “Not only heart, I also lost my intellect. It seems
that I dropped my conditioning along with my shoes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And do not only remove your shoes outside the temple, drop your head,
too! One who drops his head along with the shoes, can only enter the
temple. And shoes and head get along very well! That’s why when you get
angry with someone, you hit his head with your shoe. A monk hits his
head with his own shoes.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two extremes, two poles. The head is on one extreme...
you are at the center. And that central point is a meeting place of all
opposites. Your head and your feet are uniting there. Your heart abides
there.</p><p><br></p><p>So Moses said, “I cried, I laughed because I was filled with wonder.
I became speechless. Now I will not be able to sleep. I cannot erase
that which I have seen. That which has happened cannot be wiped out. The
Moses who lived before is no more. Now I am a different man.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a new birth. Hindus call it ‘dvija’: twice born – when is
born second time. All brahmins are not dwijas. Once in a while some
brahmin becomes dwija. You do not become a dwija by wearing a sacred
thread around your neck. Dwija means twice born. Moses said, “Now I am
twice born. Now I am a different man. That person is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you experience wonder, your old will die and the new will be born.
And if you perpetually remain in the sense of wonder, the new is born
and the old dies every moment. Every moment the old disappears and the
new appears. And your flow is eternal. Then you will never become old;
then the eternal life pulsates within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva therefore says, the sense of wonder is the foundation of
yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>The second maxim: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH.</p><p><br></p><p>The sense of wonder is the foundation. Wonder means an enquiry
inwards. An internal search of the question: who am I? If you move
outside, there is surprise. If you move outside, there is logic. If</p><p>you move outside, there is science. If you move inwards – sense of
wonder, meditation, gratitude. It is a totally different method.</p><p><br></p><p>The sense of wonder will bring you inwards because the whole world
will appear mysterious. And then only one question will seem to be
important: who am I? This is the foundation of sense of wonder: who am
I? As long as I do not know this ‘I’, this journey of knowing myself
cannot be complete. How can I know these trees, how can I know you, how
can I know the other if I myself am unknown to me, if I am myself
ignorant; when I do not know who I am.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore ‘who am I’ is the great mantra. And don’t rush the answer
because the answer is ready inside you. “Who am I” – and you answer from
within: I am the soul. This answer won’t help. You know it already. This
has not changed your life. Knowledge is fire; it will burn you. When you
ask: “Who am I” and an inner voice replies, it is your mind that is
talking – the scriptures hidden inside the mind, the memory. When you
say: ‘I am the soul’, it is useless, it is of no value because this
answer has not transformed you. This is not fire, this is ash. There may
have been an amber in it some time, for some sage, but for you it is
ash. The person who possessed this amber, has departed from this world,
now you are just carrying the ash.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on asking: Who am I? And do not give a borrowed answer.
Whenever the borrowed answer will come, you say: “This is not my answer.
I have not known it, how can it be mine? Only that which I know, can
belong to me.” That which you have earned through your own effort, is
your treasure. Knowledge can neither be stolen nor can it be begged. You
cannot steal it. You cannot beg it. Here, you have to create yourself by
your own efforts.</p><p><br></p><p>The second maxim: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment a sense of wonder is born, move inwards, sink within and
try to be established in the self. When you ask: ‘Who am I’, when will
you get an answer? If you want the answer, you will have to be
established within. We have called it health: to be established in the
self. And one is able to see only when one is established within. If you
are running, how will you be able to see?</p><p><br></p><p>Your situation is somewhat like this: you are sitting in a speeding
car, you happen to see a flower, through the window. You have barely
enquired about it, and the car has zoomed forward. You are speeding
fast. And no vehicle is faster than your desire. If one has to reach the
moon, even the spaceship takes time. Your desire does not even require
this much time, it reaches this very moment. Desire has the fastest
speed. And one who is full of desire shows that there is no depth in
him. He is running, racing. And your pace is such that even if you ask:
who am I, there is no room for an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to give up this running race and be established in the
self. You will stop all the desire, all the running around, all the
journey. But the moment one desire is fulfilled you create a number of
new desires. You barely finish one journey, and various new avenues open
up. And you start running again! You do not know how to sit down. You
have not stopped for many lifes.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that one emperor employed a very intelligent man as his
prime minister. But the prime minister was dishonest and within no time
he stole millions of rupees from the treasury of the empire. When the
emperor came to know about it, he called the prime minister and said: “I
don’t want to say</p><p>anything. What you have done is not right. I will not say much but I
can only say this much that it is a break of trust. Don’t ever show me
your face again. You leave this kingdom and go elsewhere. And I would
not like rumors to spread all around, so I will not tell anything to
anyone about it and there is no need for you to utter a word about
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said: “If you command me, I shall leave.
Certainly, I have stolen millions of rupees. Nevertheless, I would like
to advise you as a prime minister that now I have everything: a big
mansion, houses in the mountains and on the sea-shore. I have
everything. My coming generations need not earn anything. You will
remove me and appoint some other person and he will have to start from
scratch.” The emperor was intelligent, he understood.</p><p><br></p><p>You never come to such a point in your life, when you can say: I have
everything. Your trip will end when such a moment comes. Otherwise every
moment you will have to start from scratch. Each and every moment, new
desire grips you, a new thief enters, an new robber comes to rob you of
your treasure. And the robber is not one, there are innumerable desires.
You are running in many directions simultaneously. You have never given
it a thought that many of the objects are opposite to each other; you
cannot have them both. If you get one, you will lose another; if you get
the second one, the first is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was on his death-bed. He told his son: now, before I
die, I will tell you about two things. Remember them. There are two
things: honesty and wisdom. Now you will look after the shop, take care
of the work. A signboard is hanging on our shop: ‘Honesty is the best
policy’. Always practice it. Never cheat anybody. Never break a promise.
If you promise, keep it.</p><p><br></p><p>The son said: “O.K., what about the other? What does wisdom mean?”
Nasruddin said, “Never give a promise to anyone!”</p><p>Such is life – divided in opposite poles. There is an attempt to
manage both: honesty and wisdom. Honesty aims at keeping a promise. On
the one hand you want to be worshipped as a saint and on the other hand
you want to enjoy like a sinner. Strange! On the one hand you wish that
your character should be praised like that of Rama’s and on the other
hand you are keen on kidnapping somebody’s wife. You want to do the
impossible. You would like to become like Ravana and you want to be
revered like Rama. Then we are in a difficult situation. Then you move
in two opposite directions and you create infinite goals in front of
you. In their pursuit you become fragmented, torn to pieces. At the end
of your life you will find that the treasure that you had brought with
you is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great gambler. His wife, his family, his friends tried
their best to convince him. He did not pay any attention. Eventually
everything was lost. At last he came to such a point that he had only
one rupee left with him. His wife said: “Now wake up! Gather
yourself!”</p><p><br></p><p>The husband said, “When so much is lost and only one rupee is left,
give me a last chance. Who knows, this last bit of a rupee may prove
lucky.” A gambler always thinks on these lines. And he said, “Now we
have lost millions, this is the last rupee, why lament over it? And one
rupee is bound to be spent, it cannot be saved. Let me stake it!”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife also thought: now that everything is lost, this is the last
one; and one is going to be spent anyway, let him stake it!”</p><p>The gambler went to the joint. And he was amazed! He started winning
every game. One became one thousand, one thousand were converted into
ten thousand which became a hundred thousand eventually. At the end he
staked those hundred thousand and said, “Now this is the last chance.”
And he lost everything! He returned home. His wife asked, “What
happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I lost that last one too!”</p><p><br></p><p>You can lose only that which you had brought with you. Why talk about
thousands? He said: “I have lost one rupee. It does not matter. That
stake was unfortunate.” But he did not tell her that he had made one
hundred thousand. He was right. You cannot lose that which does not
belong to you. At the time of death you will find that you have lost the
soul that you had brought with you. You will be deprived of ‘one’.
That’s all! All your calculations of credit and debit, your losses and
gains are of no value. The millions that you have won, will be dropped
here at the time of your death. Only ‘one’ will be taken into account;
and that one is – “YOU.” If you establish in the ‘one’, you are a
winner. If you return to the ‘one’, settle in it... Shiva is talking
about this very phenomenon: TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS
STRENGTH.</p><p><br></p><p>You are weak and wretched and miserable – not because you don’t have
money or house or wealth. You are wretched and miserable because you are
not established in yourself. To be established in oneself is the source
of energy. The moment one is established in it, one is flooded with
tremendous energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Jesus: “What should I do? I am very poor, sickly and
miserable. Jesus said,”Don’t do anything else, first seek the kingdom of
God, all else will follow. If you lose ‘one’, you lose everything. That
‘one’ is none other than you, and that alone is your treasure because
you had brought it with you. And in the final calculation you will be
asked, whether you could save that which you brought with you or you
have lost that, too!</p><p><br></p><p>TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONESELF IS STRENGTH. To settle in oneself is to
become immensely powerful. You already have that immense power within
you, but you are like a bucket with thousands of holes. If you put the
bucket in the well, it appears to be full. As long as the bucket is
immersed in the water, it looks full; the moment you start pulling the
bucket and it starts rising above the water- level, the water starts
leaking through thousands of holes. When the bucket is drawn completely
out of the well, there is nothing left inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Your thousands of desires are your holes. Your energy dissipates
through them. As long as you are dreaming, the bucket is full. As long
as you desire, the bucket is full. The moment the desire becomes action,
you start pulling the bucket up; the moment you try to make the dreams
come true, the energy starts leaking. By the time you take the bucket
out, you are faced with nothing but holes, with no water at all. You
remain as thirsty as ever. Every time you draw the bucket, it makes lots
of noise in the well. You feel you are getting some water, as if a great
storm is coming. But nothing comes actually. You remain empty handed.
However, desire is very strange.</p><p><br></p><p>A traveler enquired of a fisherman how many fish he could catch. The
sun was about to set, he had put his fishing rod in the water since
morning. This passer by had passed through that road several times and
had noticed it. At lost he could not contain himself, so he asked: “How
many have you caught?” The fisherman answered: “If I catch this one I am
trying to catch, and if I am able to catch</p><p>two more, the total number will be three!” He has not caught a single
one so far. But he is imagining: if I catch this one, plus two more –
they will make three.</p><p><br></p><p>You are perpetually in the state of this fisherman. The one you are
trying to catch, and two more you are dreaming about. Even this one has
not materialized. But the calculation consists of three! And you are
utterly pleased. Whenever you pull the bucket out, you again find it
empty. And remember, the more you throw it in the well, the holes become
wider and wider. This is the reason why children look very happy. Old
people look very sad. Their bucket is full of holes. They have put the
bucket in the well and drawn it out innumerable times. The holes have
become bigger, that’s all! But they go on hoping against hope – some
time we will be able to draw water because the bucket does look full!
Water is leaking from the holes.</p><p><br></p><p>You have the energy of the infinite, but your mind is like a bucket
with holes.</p><p><br></p><p>This maxim means: you will not go on a desire-trip. When you drop one
desire, one hole is cemented. When all desires drop, all the holes are
cemented. And then you don’t need to put the bucket in any well, you
yourself are the well. You have tremendous energy within you. If only
your energy could be prevented from leaking, you are born with
tremendous energy. You don’t have to achieve anything. All that is worth
achieving, is within you; be careful not to lose it. There is no
question of attaining God, you have to avoid losing Him. You have
already attained Him. How you lose, is the greatest mystery of this
world.</p><p><br></p><p>The third maxim: DISCRIMINATION AND TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC IS A MEANS
TO SELF- REALIZATION.</p><p><br></p><p>Each and every maxim is like a master key. First: the sense of
wonder. The sense of wonder will make you turn in. Second: To be
established in oneself so that you are available to tremendous energy.
But how will you settle in yourself? The key lies in the third maxim:
Transcendental logic and discrimination is a means to
self-realization.</p><p><br></p><p>This word: transcendental logic has to be understood. We know what
logic is. It is an instrument of logic. It is a sword that cuts
wonderment. Logic cuts, analyses. Logic moves outside, transcendental
logic moves inside. It does not make fragments, it unites. Logic is
analysis, transcendental logic is synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>There was one Sufi monk, Farid. One of his devotees brought him a
pair of scissors made of gold. It was very valuable, studded with
precious stones. And he said, “It has been my family treasure for
generations together. It costs millions of rupees. I have no use for it.
I present it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Farid said, “Please take it back. If at all you want to present
something, bring a needle and a thread because I do not believe in
cutting, I believe in sewing. A pair of scissors cuts. If you want to
present something, better bring a needle and a thread.”</p><p><br></p><p>Logic is like a pair of scissors; it cuts. In the Hindu mythology
Ganesha is the god of logic; therefore he rides a rat. A rat is a pair
of scissors. It cuts, it is a live pair of scissors. It goes on cutting.
Ganesha rides it. He is a god of logic. And Hindus have made him a
laughing stock. If his appearance does not make you laugh, it is a
matter of surprise. You do not laugh because you have got used to his
appearance, otherwise he is humorous figure.</p><p>If you take a close look at Ganesha’s structure, you will find that
everything is shapeless in every way. Even his head does not belong to
him, it is borrowed. A logician has a borrowed head. It is quite big,
it’s an elephant’s head, but it is not his own. A borrowed head is
useless, even if it belongs to the elephant. It will only make you look
ugly. His body is bulky; rides a rat. This body of his is just a
show-piece; his vehicle is a rat. However great a scholar may be, his
vehicle is a rat – a pair of scissors: logic! Farid said it rightly, “If
you want to present something, bring a needle and a thread because I
believe in sewing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Transcendental logic is an art of synthesizing. The Sanskrit word
“VITARKA” means a special logic. Common logic analyses, special logic
synthesizes. Buddha, Mahavir, Shiva, Lao Tzu – they all use logic, but
it is a specialized logic.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one more kind of logic, which is a logical fallacy. There
arr three possibilities. Logic fragments, analyses; but its intentions
are not bad. The wonder has to be resolved. It is not interested in
analyzing. Analysis is the process. It aims at achieving a doctrine
which will dissolve the surprise, things will become crystal clear. The
aim of logic is constructive.</p><p><br></p><p>When logic has no goal, only scissoring becomes the aim, it enjoys
being destructive, then it is called “KUTARKA” logical fallacy. It is an
insane state of logic. It becomes mad, it is bent upon destroying. Then
there is no other motive, destruction gives pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Vitatka, special logic is an inward journey of logic. You have come
home from your house; your eyes, your vision, your direction was
focussed on me, towards me. You turned your back to your home. When you
will go back home, the road will be the same – in what way the road
could be different? – only the direction will change. You will turn you
back towards me and you will face your home.</p><p><br></p><p>Logic and special logic tread the same road; that’s why it is called
special logic. The road is the same, only the direction has changed.
First logic was moving towards the other, towards the object; now the
logic is moving towards the self, towards home. Just a change in the
direction changes the total quality. When it had to move outwards,
destruction was the way. If you want to enter the other, it could only
be done by analyzing, there is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to the medical college, you will find the students
dissecting. They are dissecting the frog because they have to know what
is inside. There is no other way, one can know the insides of a frog by
dissecting. it. But if you have to enter within yourself, there is no
need to dissect. You are present inside! If you want to know the other,
you will have to dissect him, destroy him because there is no other way
of knowing him. If you want to know yourself, there is no question of
dissecting or destroying because you are already there! If you want to
know yourself, just closing your eyes is enough. Closing one’s eyes is
meditation. When the attention is withdrawn from outside and focussed
inside, logic becomes transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>The other name for vitark is vivek, or consciousness. It really means
awareness. This awareness is a process of synthesis. As you go within
you, you start becoming integrated. For example: imagine a circle with a
wide circumference. Now take two points, far apart on the circumference.
Join each to the point at the center of the circle. You will find that
as the lines approach the center, they come closer and closer to each
other, until they are one at the center. Now if these two lines are
extended further outside the circumference, they will be further and
further apart, until the distance between them becomes infinite.</p><p>In the same way, when you move outwards from yourself, things begin
to fall apart, and the further you go the greater becomes the difference
between them. Therefore, we find many different branches of science
because the distance is becoming bigger and bigger. New theories are
born every day, and scientists are facing a dilemma: one science cannot
understand the language of the other. There is no such person on earth
who can understand all the sciences, who can synthesize the different
branches of science.</p><p><br></p><p>As it is, it is impossible to know a single branch of science. There
is no dearth of knowledge in the world, but we have lost the power of
synthesis. Religion is one, no matter how many names you give it,
because no sooner does a man begin to go within himself than the
distances decrease, and all things merge into the center. The center is
the ultimate synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>Vitark or vivek, intelligence or awareness, discrimination leads to
self-realization. Do not dissect things. Do not go outwards; do not pay
attention to ‘the other’. Direct your attention inwards; synthesize!
Move slowly towards the center, where your life-force is focussed.
Become established at this point and great energy will arise within
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The light we see around Mahavir or Buddha, the bliss we find around
Krishna, Meera, Chaitanya – what bliss is this? What light is it? What
does it signify? It indicates that these people have reached the point
which is the source of infinite energy. They are no longer miserable,
they are no longer poor. They are emperors in their own right. This is
also your potential, but you have to proceed step by step.</p><p><br></p><p>First comes a sense of wonder; then being centered in the self; then
intelligence as a way of reaching the self.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>TO ENJOY THE BLISS OF EXISTENCE IS SAMADHI.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have reached the self and are firmly established in it, you
have reached the most profound state of existence. Existence is at its
greatest density at this point, for everything is created out of here.
Your center is not only your center but the center of all creation.</p><p><br></p><p>We are separated only at the circumference. ‘You’ and ‘I’ are
separations of the body. As we leave the body and turn within, the
distance gets smaller and smaller. The day you know the soul you will
also have known God. The day you know your own self you will know the
self of all creation, because at the center all is one. Distances only
exist at the periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva says: By attaining this existence within one’s self, the joy of
samadhi is attained.</p><p><br></p><p>Samadhi-sukham, the ‘bliss of samadhi’; these words should be
understood. You have known many joys: the joy of a good dinner, the joy
of good health and well-being. When you quench your thirst or enjoy sex
– such bodily joys you know fully, but understand well that all these
joys carry complementary sorrows with them. If you are not thirsty,
water will bring no joy. If you are prepared to undergo the torment of
thirst, only then will you enjoy drinking water. The affliction, the
agony, comes first and is long; the ensuing joy is only momentary. As
soon as the water slides down the</p><p>throat the thirst is quenched. The same is true with food. The more
you suffer the pangs of hunger, the tastier is the food.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the irony of life; the people who are tormented by hunger,
who could really enjoy the pleasures of eating, have nothing to eat.
Those who do not know what hunger is, have plenty to eat, but they
cannot enjoy their food; on the contrary, it is a source of distress for
them.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as there is thirst in you, water can quench it; but you can
live a kind of life in which you never feel thirsty; do not go in the
sun, do no manual work, stay at home and relax and you will not feel the
thirst. But then you will find no joy in drinking water. He who toils
all day, enjoys the bliss of a good night’s rest. This is ironical: if
you want to enjoy the pleasure of a good night’s sleep you have to work
like a laborer all day. The trouble is that you want to spend your days
like an emperor and your nights like a laborer.</p><p><br></p><p>In the external world, in the world of objects, joy and sorrow are
intrinsically connected; therefore, the day you acquire a mansion, sleep
will desert you. The day you obtain a feather bed you will find yourself
tossing in your sleep all night. Look at the laborer; he sleeps under a
tree on top of stones and pebbles. He sleeps like a log. Mosquitos bite
him; he is so hot that his body is soaked with perspiration, but he is
oblivious to it all. He has gone through such intense misery all through
the day that he has earned the joy that he will have in the night.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to pay for our joy and comfort with toil and troubles in this
world. Here each joy is connected with an equivalent sorrow. And human
being is entangled in one dilemma: he wants to keep the joy and get rid
of the sorrow. But this is impossible. We have been trying for thousands
of years that the sorrow should be eliminated and the joy should be
saved. But we have not been successful in our efforts. The sorrow is
certainly eliminated, but at the same time the joy is reduced
proportionately. We resent sorrow and desire joy. Hence the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the meaning of the ‘joy of samadhi’? That which has no sorrow
attached to it. The bliss of samadhi is not quenching any thirst, it is
not filling an empty stomach, nor is it the weariness after a hard day’s
work. The bliss of samadhi is not connected with sorrow and toil. This
is the difference between spiritual joy and worldly joys. THE BLISS OF
SAMADHI IS THE BLISS OF SIMPLY EXISTING. No desire, no longing or
craving, is connected with it. It is simply the ‘joy of being’.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore Shiva speaks of the ‘bliss of existence’, lokananda. That
you are – that in itself is a great bliss! It has nothing to do with
desires and pain etc. Remember, the soul suffers from no hunger and no
thirst; hence the question of hunger and thirst and the pleasure gained
out of their satiation does not arise. All thirsts and hungers belong to
the body, so when a person desires the pleasures of the body he should
also be prepared for the pains. The more he is prepared to go through
the pains and suffering, the more happiness he attains. The joy of the
soul is the purest of joys. There is no place for sorrow here. But this
occurs only at the center. At the circumference you are the body.</p><p><br></p><p>The body is the periphery. It is the surrounding wall of your vessel;
it is not you. It is your outer circle. At the center you are the soul,
and it is here that a completely new kind of joy unfolds itself. Here
the joy is the joy of being – just being. There is no peak of happiness
and abyss of misery here: no ups and downs; no gain or loss, no night or
day, no toil or rest. Only you are there. There</p><p>you become eternal, and this state of being eternal is filled with
joy. It is overflowing. Its juice never dries up. Therefore saints call
it ‘eternal’, everlasting, always new.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir says: the juice of nectar flows incessantly unhindered, without
any variation. It rains in this world, too, but the rains must be
preceded by heat.</p><p><br></p><p>When the summer heat reaches its peak – when there are cracks in the
earth, when the trees start wailing, when the heat becomes unbearable
all over – then the rains come. We may ask: Why this absurd law? Why can
there not be rains without all this suffering? But then we have to
understand the whole system of nature, the mathematics of nature. The
clouds are formed only when the heat becomes suffocating, for water then
turns into vapor. There will be no rains if there is no evaporation. The
vapor rises and forms clouds, and when the clouds are over-saturated –
so much that they can’t help showering, it starts raining. So unbearable
heat is prerequisite for a good rainy season.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world of the soul there are no opposites, no duality.
Therefore it is referred to as ‘non-dual’ or indivisible. Here there is
only one, not two. But then it becomes difficult for you to understand
what kind of joy this is, for you know of no joy without its ensuing
pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Sigmund Freud for a definition of madness. How do
people become insane? Freud’s answer was wonderful and very strange. He
said, “Success and madness have a common definition. The path to success
is the path to insanity.” When you want to succeed, you become tense;
when you want to succeed, you fight. Your days and nights are filled
with anxiety. When you want to succeed, your each and every moment is
overshadowed with fear: will you succeed or won’t you? What if you
don’t? You are not alone. There are thousands of competitors. Night and
day you are in a state of acute tension, and this is exactly the
prescription for losing your sanity! So carefully observe the people you
call successful; you will notice that they live in the same state of
constant restlessness, tension and anxiety that the madmen live in.</p><p><br></p><p>When Krushchev was in power in Russia he went to inspect a mental
hospital. While he was at the hospital he remembered an important
message, so he rang up his office, but the girl at the switchboard paid
no attention. There was a reason why she ignored him, which became clear
later. Finally he was fed up. He shouted, “Young lady, do you know who I
am?” This is common to all those who are successful, who are in power
and have money – inwardly this thought is incessantly echoing in his
mind: do you know, who I am? He may not speak loudly but inside, he is
saying it over and over again. This is the reason why he has staked
everything. At last he could not contain himself and said to the girl,
“Do you know who I am ? I am Krushchev, the prime minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl said, “I do not know who you are, but I know where you are
calling from – the mental hospital.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the fact is, all the prime ministers speak from the same place.
There is no other place for them to speak from.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Krushchev went to London where he was given a very costly piece
of cloth. The cloth was so expensive that he wanted the best tailor of
the world to stitch it. He asked the best tailor of Moscow. He wanted to
make a coat and pant, complete with waistcoat. The Russian tailor said
the cloth was not sufficient for a three-piece suit. He could only make
a two-piece suit. The material was so</p><p>expensive that Krushchev wanted three pieces to be made. He took the
cloth to London. There he was told that he could easily get a
three-piece suit for enough cloth left over to make something for his
child also.</p><p><br></p><p>Krushchev was shocked. He asked, how his own Russian tailor could be
so dishonest? He said, only two pieces can be made. The London tailor
answered, “Don’t be angry with him. In Russia you are a very big man.
Here in London you are next to nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>When a man sets out to surround himself with pleasures of success and
ambition, he will have to endure suffering and hardship exactly equal to
the pleasure he pursues, and this hardship and suffering break him
completely. Long before he can experience any feeling of success, he has
almost become unsuccessful. In this world no one can be successful
because the price for success is terrible madness, insanity. And by the
time success knocks on your door, you are not in a position to enjoy
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The pleasure of samadhi is entirely different. You do not have to pay
the price for it, for what you set out to find is present now – at this
very moment. It is not somewhere in the future, so that you have to sat
out on a quest and toil and labour. It is present here and now. You
possess it already. This treasure is your birthright, you don’t have to
pay the price of suffering in order to get it. In that case one wonders,
what would be it like?</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever joy you have known cannot compare with, or even give you an
inkling, of this joy, for all your joys are mixed with sorrows. All the
nectar you have known has been mixed with poison. With the body this is
bound to be; birth and death, nectar and poison are side by side. Each
worldly joy carries its counterpart of pain. But the soul is only
immortal. There is no death for the soul; it is eternal. There are no
opposites; there is only existence, pure existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps, if you could visualize your physical pleasures without their
pain and bitterness, just drop the bitter taste lingering in your mouth
and you might be able to imagine this happiness or something like it;
but this would be only a glimpse. It cannot give you a clear picture.
The circumference can only give you a glimpse. No matter how much you
contemplate, you cannot imagine or conceptualize that which you have
never experienced. You have to experience it first.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras are invaluable. Be filled with wonder. Turn towards the
self. Become centered in your being so that great energy will be at your
disposal. Let life be yours – the supreme life. Attain self- knowledge
through intelligence – through awareness, the supreme awareness – and by
breaking through your slumber you shall enjoy the bliss of existence.
The bliss of samadhi is yours for the asking.</p><p><br></p><p>Something more about the bliss of samadhi: worldly joy depends on
very many factors. It depends in your capability and incapability, your
education or non-education, your strength, your natural gifts, your
relations, your connections – it depends on all these and more. You are
not alone there. If you are born to a poor household you will take
longer to achieve your goal, perhaps a whole life-time. If you are born
into a wealthy family it may take you less time. If you are clever,
cunning, intelligent, you will reach early. If you are dull and stupid
you will wander a great deal; it is doubtful whether you will reach at
all. If the body is unhealthy or diseased it is difficult; if the body
is healthy you are better equipped. So everything is accidental and
depends on a thousand and one things.</p><p>The bliss of samadhi does not depend on anything, it is
unconditional. It depends neither on your intellect nor on your body. It
makes no difference whether you are worthy or unworthy, nor does it
depend on your family, your education, your looks or your sex, or your
casts or your religion or your age. It is absolutely unconditional joy
because it is your very own treasure. It is within you already. You are
born with it. It is only that you have not paid attention to it; that is
all. You have merely forgotten it, not lost it. Just turn your eyes;
look back and take a look at yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that a clever person will attain more bliss of samadhi and
a dull person less. This is not at all the case. Even illiterate people
reach there. Kabir, who was illiterate, unlettered, reached where Buddha
reached. And when both reach, there is not an iota of difference between
the two. The bliss of samadhi is the very nature of existence. Whether
you are fair or dark on your periphery, ugly or beautiful, healthy or
unhealthy – whether your brain is filled with the words of various
doctrines or not – all of this does not matter at all. Your being is
sufficient. That you exist is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, all meditation is a quest to become pure. When you forget
the body, forget the mind, then you will begin to attain the joy of
existence, the bliss of samadhi. Just try to do one thing: try to forget
the body and the mind for some time. As soon as they are forgotten you
begin to remember the soul. As long as you are aware of body and mind
you cannot remember the soul. The mind and body are on the periphery,
whereas the soul is at the center. You cannot look at both of them at
the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>In this meditation camp if you could forget the body and mind for a
little while you will gain the taste of the bliss of samadhi. Once you
get the taste, that is enough. Your life will take a different turn. It
is the initial taste that is difficult. Once you know, once you have
turned within and seen, then you know the trick. Then whenever you turn
you will see. All the effort is needed in this initial turning in.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the key is in your hands, you are the master. Then you can taste
this pleasure at will. You may wander fearlessly in the world now, and
nobody can steal your treasure. Wherever you are, you may be a
shopkeeper attending your customer, this bliss is with you and you
experience it. One thing will start happening: you will stop seeking
worldly pleasures. When the supreme joy is attained who cares about
trivial pleasure? When diamonds and rubies are in your hands who will
hold on to colored stones? They will drop by themselves; you need not
renounce them.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason I always say that a wise person renounces nothing;
that which is useless, falls away by itself. Ignorant people renounce
because renunciation is very painful for them. They have no knowledge of
what is meaningful, and they are busy renouncing the meaningless. But
the mind clings. The mind says: You are leaving what is in your hands,
and how can you trust that which is not yet in your grasp? Besides, who
even knows whether it exists or not?</p><p><br></p><p>So I tell you to give up nothing. I only tell you to have one taste
of the bliss of samadhi. This simple taste will become the supreme
renunciation in your life. Then you will know for yourself what is
useless and once we know a thing to be useless, we feel no misgivings
about letting go of it. Then it falls on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great saint of Bengal, Yukteshwar Giri. He was known as a
great renunciate. A wealthy person once came to him and said, “You are a
great renunciate.”</p><p>Giri laughed out loud. “Look at him!” he said, pointing to the man.
“Look at him! He is a great renunciate himself, and he is calling me
one. Don’t try to trap me with your words, my good man!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was shocked, even his disciples. They begged him to explain
because there was no doubt that Giri was a great renunciate. Giri said,
“Suppose there is a pile of diamonds and a pile of pebbles. This man
holds on the pebbles, while I hold on the diamonds! And he thinks I am a
renunciate!”</p><p><br></p><p>Who has renounced, Mahavir or you, Buddha or you? You have renounced,
for you hold on to rubbish. You have discarded the joy of samadhi in
favor of the anxiety-ridden affairs of the periphery, and what have you
got in exchange for your bliss is so flimsy. So coarse and crude! So
stale and dirty!</p><p><br></p><p>The worldly man is a great renunciate, but he thinks the sannyasin is
the renunciate. In fact, worldly men look at sannyasins with pity: “Poor
things, they have left everything. They have missed all of life’s
pleasures.”</p><p><br></p><p>They revere sannyasins and deep down pity them, too: “Poor things!
They have renounced everything without enjoying anything. At least some
things they should have enjoyed!” But worldly man have no ideas whom
they are talking about. The sannyasin has experienced the greatest
enjoyment. He has been invited by the vast existence to partake of the
greatest of all enjoyments.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not ask you to give up anything. I only ask you to know, to
taste. This very taste then will slowly displace all that is useless and
trivial in your life. The useless just falls away; it needs to be
renounced.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

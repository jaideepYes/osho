It means: one who satisfies. Without God there is no satisfaction possible. One can go on searching and one will find many things in life but nothing is going to satisfy. Just a moment’s illusion that one feels satisfaction, one has not even felt it and it is gone. Just a dewdrop slipping on the grass leaf: you have not even seen it correctly and it has disappeared, fallen. That’s how we come across satisfaction: one desire is satisfied – for a moment one feels good, but only for a moment, and again the whole turmoil starts, again the whole trip. As one desire disappears, ten desires arise in its place, and it is a non-ending process.\nOnly with God does that process stop, that wheel moves no more. When one comes to see God, feel God, live God, all desiring disappears – one is utterly satisfied, and forever. It is not momentary satisfaction, it is contentment, absolute contentment; hence the name Hasiba. God is one who satisfies, who really satisfies.\nEverything else in life only promises, but they are false promises, the goods are never delivered. Money promises that if you have it you will be helped. But people go on becoming richer and richer and happiness never arises. It is always there like the horizon – very elusive. Relationships give one the idea that everything will be good now and one will live in happiness forever, but it never happens. It happens only with God and in God.\nSo whatsoever satisfies you totally, absolutely and forever, is what God is: God is another name for that which satisfies.\nHadi is a sufi name for God – it means: the guide. All guidance is from God, and the guidance is always coming – we just have to learn how to listen. It is a still small voice in the heart. If the mind is too full of noise you will not be able to hear it. Once the mind is silent, that still small voice arises. And it is absolutely clear, with no hesitation, with no wavering. It leaves no alternatives; it is not a\nquestion of choice, it is very decisive. One simply has to do it, there is nothing else that can be done. But we don’t hear it – our minds are in such turmoil, the traffic noise of the thoughts is so much.\nThe guide is not outside, the guide is within you. One has to go deeper into one’s own being to find God and the guide. Once the inner guide is found there are no more mistakes, no repentance, no guilt. There is no question of doing good or doing bad; whatsoever one does is good. It is not a question of morality either; one’s very being is good and whatsoever comes out of it is good. One walks in light and one walks lightly because the head and the burden of the head is no more there. And when one walks in light and walks lightly, life becomes laughter, love, joy.\nUntil the inner guide is found, a master is needed. Once the guide is found, you have found the master within yourself. The master is there simply to say something to you which is being said by your heart already. But you cannot hear it so it has to be said from the outside, because we can listen to something from the outside more easily than to something that comes from the inside.\nThe master outside is just a representation of the guide within. So the inner guide and the outer master are not two phenomena; they speak the same language. Surrendering to the master is really surrendering to your own inner guide, because the outer master functions only as an echoing point, as a mirror: he reflects you. He makes things clear which are not clear to you, that’s all. He simply says loudly that which is being said by your heart silently. He magnifies the still small voice.\n[Swami Rashid. Swami, master, as a reminder that he is ultimately master of himself. For him, the way is through the understanding of God as provider.]\nGod is always providing; whatsoever is our need is always looked after. We unnecessarily become worried about our own self. There is not a thing to worry about. Once this trust arises, life becomes a joy. The universe is not antagonistic to you. It has mothered you, it has fathered you; it is both your mother and father. You are part of it. It goes on nourishing you, it cares!\nTo understand this is to relax. Those who don’t understand this remain tense – naturally, because they have to take care of themselves. Then there are a thousand and one problems to be faced. They have to plan for the future and it creates anxiety. Planning for the future they go on missing the present, so their whole life becomes just planning for life but never living it. They are also worried about the past because they have done a thousand and one things which were not right. And the mind goes on thinking: ‘I should have done this rather than that.’ Between the past and the future they are crushed, between these two rocks they are sandwiched.\nOnce you understand that God is the provider, great freedom arises. There is no past then and no future, there is only present. You can live it to the maximum. Then life is not just an endurance but an enjoyment. That’s the meaning of your name.\nMajido. It is a name of God. It means ‘the glorious one.’ That is the next step in wisdom, because human wisdom is of no use unless it reveals to you the glories of God. Human wisdom can even become harmful: it can make you egoistic. It has to be surrendered at the feet of God. All glory and all wisdom is His. Man has just to be a fool in the eyes of God. From this moment think of God as wise and yourself as the fool. And that will give you the real wisdom.\nTo be foolish in front of God is to be wise. Blessed are the ignorant ones for they shall know.…\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says he feels a block around his third eye. It’s been there for the past year and has become more pronounced over the last six months. It’s always there when he meditates. Osho checks his energy.]\nIt is something that has to be accepted very lovingly. It is not anything bad, just the meditative energy is trying to penetrate the higher planes. It hits the third eye centre, that’s why the pain arises. Any day there will be a breakthrough. Before that breakthrough the energy has to go on knocking at the door. And nobody knows at what knock the door will open. It may open at the second or the third or the fourth – any knock and it can open – but it is very close by. And before the door opens the pain will become even more severe.\nBut don’t be worried about it and don’t take any medicine for it. Just enjoy it. If it becomes too much, too unbearable, then just take a shower; it will help. But no medicine, because any medicine will be a hindrance.\nYes, you have to accept it. And whenever you need me just put this (the little box) on your third eye, mm ? Keep it with you. And come back!\n[A sannyasin says: I feel weak. I feel more receptive and feminine since Primal. Lots of father-figures coming up – teachers and everything. I don’t know if I should do something or just to let it go. Osho checks his energy.]\nYou have to relax into it; nothing else has to be done. It is perfectly good, you are on the right track. Become more feminine, become more soft, delicate, and allow it to happen. Your ego is trying to create trouble. Your ego is saying to you ‘Be strong, be masculine, be this and that.’ Don’t go on that male chauvinistic trip – forget about it. Relax. Whatsoever is coming naturally is beautiful. This femininity has to be absorbed.\nIt is not weakness, it is delicateness; it is softness that you are thinking is weakness. To use the word ‘weakness’ is to evaluate it. Your ego is evaluating it, condemning it – that this is something wrong, you are becoming weak. Ego always thinks of softness as weakness. That’s why women have been thought down the ages to be the weaker sex. It is not true, it is just false.\nThe woman is the stronger sex but she is delicate, that is true. And now biological investigations prove that. Women live five years more than men: their average age is five years longer. More men go mad than women, double the number. More men commit suicide than women, double the number. More men are prone to illness than women; women have more resistance against disease and illness than men. Women are capable of tolerating pain much longer than men. Just think of giving birth to a child or having a child in your womb for nine months and then for years the nuisance that the children create. Only a woman is able to bear it all. She has a kind of strength which is totally different. She may not have muscular power but muscular power is not the only way to judge strength. The deeper way to judge strength is by the capacity to resist illness, death, the capacity to tolerate pain, the capacity to remain alive in spite of all that is against life, the capacity to remain sane in spite of the whole insane world.\nDrop that word ‘weakness’ – simply call it softness, femininity, and allow it. Much more is on the way. And it is beautiful!\n[The sannyasin adds: I’d like to be with a woman. I just sit and just wait and nothing happens, you know.]\nJust hang a small signboard: I am waiting for a woman and nothing is happening.\nMany women are waiting for a man and nothing is happening – they will start turning towards you! Just let it be known, that’s all. Tomorrow just have a signboard and see: many women will start enquiring.\nIt is not a problem, not at all. Try a signboard!\n[A sannyasin says she feels a lot of fear. She is not in a relationship and feels fear to move into one. She feels better when she is not in a relationship.]\nMy feeling is that the fear is right. Your energy enjoys being alone better. You should not fight with the fear. That fear is indicating the right path for you. At this moment your energy needs to be left alone to yourself, hence the fear is coming. Fear is not always wrong, remember. Nothing is always wrong; it depends. People have such ideas that fear is always wrong – it is not. Yes, sometimes it is wrong, sometimes it is not. Nothing is always right-and nothing is always wrong; everything depends on the context.\nRight now your fear is perfectly right – it simply says to you ‘Don’t get involved’; hence the fear arises. It is not the fear of the new, not at all; that is a misinterpretation. It is simply fear that if you get entangled in energy, somebody else’s energy, you will lose the centering which is growing. You are becoming more centered, you are settling more in your being. You are coming to terms with your aloneness and if you fall into a relationship that will be dragging yourself out. Your movement is inwards; a relationship will take you out and that will create a contradiction. Hence the fear. The fear is really helpful – it-is showing you not to be foolish.\nRemain alone. When the fear disappears move into relationship, then it will be perfectly right. It will disappear – when its time is gone, when you have settled, when the energy is exactly as it should be inside, then one can afford to go out. First one has to settle inside, then it is easy to go outside, it is not a distraction. In fact it becomes an enhancement of the inner because of the contrast. It becomes a little holiday from the inner but you always come back. Then it is not destructive, it is creative. Then love helps meditation.\nSo simply wait. Listen to your fear and don’t repress it. It will disappear on its own. When the energy is ready to go out, you will suddenly see one day that you are moving with somebody and there is no fear at all – your whole being is with you. When that happens then move into relationship. Till then, avoid, mm? Even if he [the previous sannyasin] puts on a signboard, you avoid it! Mm, look at him. Look at him well, otherwise tomorrow he will put on the signboard. He is sitting there!\nLook at his face, otherwise he will put on the signboard and you will be the first victim!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2232","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2232 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

satisfaction possible. One can go on searching and one will find many
things in life but nothing is going to satisfy. Just a moment’s illusion
that one feels satisfaction, one has not even felt it and it is gone.
Just a dewdrop slipping on the grass leaf: you have not even seen it
correctly and it has disappeared, fallen. That’s how we come across

than men: their average age is five years longer. More men go mad than
women, double the number. More men commit suicide than women, double the
number. More men are prone to illness than women; women have more
resistance against disease and illness than men. Women are capable of
tolerating pain much longer than men. Just think of giving birth to a
child or having a child in your womb for nine months and then for years
the nuisance that the children create. Only a woman is able to bear it
all. She has a kind of strength which is totally different. She may not
have muscular power but muscular power is not the only way to judge
strength. The deeper way to judge strength is by the capacity to resist
illness, death, the capacity to tolerate pain, the capacity to remain
alive in spite of all that is against life, the capacity to remain sane
in spite of the whole insane world.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop that word ‘weakness’ – simply call it softness, femininity, and
allow it. Much more is on the way. And it is beautiful!</p><p>[The sannyasin adds: I’d like to be with a woman. I just sit and just
wait and nothing happens, you know.]</p><p><br></p><p>Just hang a small signboard: I am waiting for a woman and nothing is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Many women are waiting for a man and nothing is happening – they will
start turning towards you! Just let it be known, that’s all. Tomorrow
just have a signboard and see: many women will start enquiring.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a problem, not at all. Try a signboard!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she feels a lot of fear. She is not in a
relationship and feels fear to move into one. She feels better when she
is not in a relationship.]</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is that the fear is right. Your energy enjoys being alone
better. You should not fight with the fear. That fear is indicating the
right path for you. At this moment your energy needs to be left alone to
yourself, hence the fear is coming. Fear is not always wrong, remember.
Nothing is always wrong; it depends. People have such ideas that fear is
always wrong – it is not. Yes, sometimes it is wrong, sometimes it is
not. Nothing is always right-and nothing is always wrong; everything
depends on the context.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now your fear is perfectly right – it simply says to you ‘Don’t
get involved’; hence the fear arises. It is not the fear of the new, not
at all; that is a misinterpretation. It is simply fear that if you get
entangled in energy, somebody else’s energy, you will lose the centering
which is growing. You are becoming more centered, you are settling more
in your being. You are coming to terms with your aloneness and if you
fall into a relationship that will be dragging yourself out. Your
movement is inwards; a relationship will take you out and that will
create a contradiction. Hence the fear. The fear is really helpful –
it-is showing you not to be foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain alone. When the fear disappears move into relationship, then
it will be perfectly right. It will disappear – when its time is gone,
when you have settled, when the energy is exactly as it should be
inside, then one can afford to go out. First one has to settle inside,
then it is easy to go outside, it is not a distraction. In fact it
becomes an enhancement of the inner because of the contrast. It becomes
a little holiday from the inner but you always come back. Then it is not
destructive, it is creative. Then love helps meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply wait. Listen to your fear and don’t repress it. It will
disappear on its own. When the energy is ready to go out, you will
suddenly see one day that you are moving with somebody and there is no
fear at all – your whole being is with you. When that happens then move
into relationship. Till then, avoid, mm? Even if he [the previous
sannyasin] puts on a signboard, you avoid it! Mm, look at him. Look at
him well, otherwise tomorrow he will put on the signboard. He is sitting
there!</p><p><br></p><p>Look at his face, otherwise he will put on the signboard and you will
be the first victim!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

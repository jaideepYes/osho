It means: the first, the alpha. Sufism has both names for God: one is ‘the first’ and the other is ‘the last’. God is the first and also the last, the source and the goal, the root and the flower. God is all – the beginning and the end. But it is good to begin with the beginning. Just start thinking from this moment that basically you are divine, that at the source you are divine; then the goal becomes very easy. Once this milieu surrounds you – that basically you are divine, that at the source you are God – then the goal is not far away.\nOne cannot become divine unless one already is. We can become only that which we are. Becoming is nothing but unfolding: the hidden becomes manifest. But the hidden is as much as the manifest. And once we know that at the source we are divine, then a great trust arises that nothing can go wrong. Even if we go as far away as possible, we remain divine. The sinner is as divine as the saint. There is no distinction at the root, at the source.\nAll distinctions are just fictitious, fictions that we create. All action is fiction. You do something; you become confined by that act. I do something else; I become confined by that act. But neither are you your act nor am I my act – the action cannot become our definition. But that’s how it happens. A person who works as an engineer becomes an engineer. That is only his act, that is not his definition; but we start thinking about him as the engineer, as a doctor, as the sinner, as the saint, as good, as bad, but these are just acts. Our reality is infinite and cannot be contained by any act whatsoever. The act is just a ripple on the ocean – almost irrelevant.\nThat is the greatest message the East has to give to the world – that what we do is immaterial. Christianity has made too much fuss about the act and has completely forgotten the language of being. Hence it has reduced people to sinners, into guilty persons, pathological. People have to be redeemed from their guilt; they have to be redeemed from the very idea that The act can define them. They have to be redeemed from this reductionism, that a man is nothing but his acts: ’You are\nwhat you do.’ No, you are not what you do. What you do is a response in a certain circumstance. It may be good, it may be bad, it may be moral, it may be immoral. It is only that – a certain response to a certain stimulus, nothing more, nothing less. You remain out of it, your purity remains uncontaminated.\nThis is the meaning of Awwala: we are God in the very source of our being. The very ground of our being is divine; there is no way to lose it. Even if we try, we cannot succeed. It is intrinsic, it is not something like an attribute given to us from the outside . it is our nature. Once this vision gets deeper and deeper into your heart you will start feeling a great change arising.\nThe moment guilt disappears, a person becomes religious, never before. So any religion that depends on creating guilt in people is not true religion. It is really exploitation, a very psychological conspiracy against humanity. But almost all the priests of all the religions have depended on that strategy. It gives them immense power. The more you can make people feel guilty, the more powerful you become. And the more guilty they feel, the more they bow down to you, the more they are ready to submit, to become slaves. They are afraid, shaken. They cannot depend on themselves – they have to lean on some authority.\nThis is a psychological strategy to exploit people. It is really the oldest technique of mind-wash. And all the religions have used it. Christ has not used it, Buddha has not used it, but the priests – whether they are christian, buddhist or hindu – have all used it. If we look into the strategy of the priests we will find only a few simple rules: create guilt in people, create fear in people and they will be in your hands.\nMy work here consists of giving you freedom... in reminding you that you are God.\n[A sannyasin couple are leaving to finish things in the west so they can be here forever. The woman says: I feel very privileged.]\nYou are... and you will become much more! To those who have, more shall be given to them; that’s how it works. The richer you are, the richer you become. The happier you are, the happier you become. And the vice-versa is true too: a miserable person attracts misery. So remember that always.\nIf this simple law can be remembered the whole of life becomes transformed, because the like attracts the like. If you are happy, the whole existence starts flowing towards you in happiness. If you are dancing, the whole existence is ready to meet you in the dance, as a dance. If you are miserable, things start going away from you; you are left alone.\nTo be with me one has to follow this fundamental law: the more you absorb me, the more privileged you feel, the more you will get. And there is no end to it because I am simply a door to the non- ending, to the infinite. Pass through me... and as fast as possible!\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I’m a little bit afraid of the change. I’m becoming stronger but I’m feeling less soft.]\nAllow it to happen. Women have been taught a false softness; one that is not true. A true softness is never weak; a true softness has its own strength.\nBut down the ages women have been taught a false kind of softness which is not true. That makes them weak. That is just on the surface – it is a polish. Every girl has been taught to be soft, to be feminine, to be this and that. And in fact there is no need to teach – a girl is a girl, she is feminine. The taught femininity is false, pseudo, and when the taught femininity surrounds you, your natural femininity disappears. That’s what is happening: your false softness will disappear and you will become more and more strong. And you will feel afraid: What is happening to you ? Where is your femininity going ? You will be afraid of the strength, but never be afraid of the strength.\nIt will make you your real self, and then a totally different kind of softness will arise: the real, the untaught, the spontaneous. That which you are carrying hidden in your heart will bloom. But the false has to be dropped for the real to be and between the two you will feel a little hesitant and afraid, uncertain, uncentered. But there is no need to be afraid.\n[A sannyasin, arriving, says when he was in away he had a lot of questions all the time and he felt very aggressive. Once he arrived here he stepped into another dimension and all the questions disappeared.]\nThat’s very good! That’s how it should be. If you really love me, just by being in my presence your questions will disappear. There is no need to ask; th y are answered before you ask. And the presence answers them far more deeply, far more profoundly.\nTo be here means to be in my presence, and without your knowing you start falling in tune with me. Your state of consciousness is altered, your level of consciousness becomes different so the questions that existed on the first level can’t exist on this level. There is every possibility that when you lose contact with me they will bubble up again. That will be an indication that you have forgotten me.\nDon’t be worried about those questions. Rather, try to contact me again. And you can invoke my presence anywhere. All that it needs is a prayerful, loving heart. You can call me anywhere. There is no need for you to come here to feel my presence; I can come to you. Slowly slowly all of my sannyasins learn the knack of it.\nAnd wherever you are, once you have caught me and can feel me, those questions will disappear immediately. Alone, on your own, you are nothing but a bundle of questions. To be with me is to become the answer. So let this experience become very significant to you.\nThe real thing is never to solve the questions. The real thing is to transcend them, to surpass them, to go beyond them, to be in another kind of reality where those questions do not arise.\nThis is the difference between religion and philosophy. Philosophy tries to solve the questions, and hence not a single question has been solved by philosophy. It is an exercise in utter futility. Religion tries to change the level of consciousness, the state of the mind. There is a state in which there are questions and there is a state where no questions exist. Religion has solved all questions without solving a single one. In fact it solves the questioner.\nTo be with me is to be in contact with a living religion. I am not here to solve your questions; I am here to solve you. If you allow me, I am not going to destroy your questions – I am going to destroy the questioner. And it has started happening. Become a little more courageous and go ahead!\n[A sannyasin says she feels like she is dying. She is working in the pottery department.]\nThat’s good work! That’s really good work. If you can go deep into it, no other meditation is needed. It is a great meditation in itself and it can centre you. So go deep into it.\nAnd don’t be worried: you are not dying. You are becoming more alive – you were dead.\nYes, of course – as you are, you have to die. You have been dead up to now; you have to die to that deadness in you. But in fact you are becoming more alive. It will look like a kind of death in the beginning.Allow it. And you are in the right kind of work to help it.\nYou wanted to become assistant to Somendra but I didn’t like that idea, it would not have helped you at all. It would have destroyed your energy, it would have eaten you up. You would have fallen into fragments. To be a therapist or to be an assistant to a therapist needs a different kind of person and you are not that kind of person at all. But this work is perfectly good for you. Go into it, put all your energy into it.\nAnd we are going to make pottery something really big – just a few days more, mm? – because I love it.\nAnd it is far better to be with pots than to be with people! Pots are beautiful peopleand people are\njust ugly pots!\nAnand means bliss, guha means a cave – a cave of bliss. It is a metaphor: it means the heart, the heart is the cave of bliss. Bliss is hidden in the heart, in the cave of the heart. People go on searching everywhere else but they never search in the heart; it is there. Hence everybody is miserable.\nThey look around the world, they go to the farthest corners of the world in search of blissand it\nis in their heart. That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘The kingdom of God is within you’; he is indicating the cave Of the heart. So the message in your name is: look into the heart, go deep into your heart – all that has to be found is already there, already given. God has given you already all that you will ever need. All that is needed to become fulfilled is there; one just has to penetrate one’s own heart.\nStep down from the head. Move more from thinking to feeling, from logic to love, from prose to poetry. In every way let the heart function more.\nWhen you are reading, reading prose, the heart does not function; then the head is enough. But when you are reading poetry the heart starts beating, a different rhythm comes to it. The real poetry has nothing to do with the head – it is illogical. It has immense beauty but no utility. It has great charm, magic, majesty. You cannot prove it, you can only enjoy it. And if somebody can enjoy it, he will know, but there is no way to communicate your joy of poetry to somebody else; it is a heart thing. And in the same way the whole life is divided between the head and the heart.\nSo always look to what will help your heart to function more and go towards that. Create all kinds of situations in which the heart starts functioning. It has not functioned for many lives. It has forgotten to function. So don’t miss any opportunity. Just come closeand start from this moment.\n[A sannyasin reports back about his individual meditation – ‘talking in tongues.’ He gets stuck at some point: his body becomes tense and he feels suffocated and then he can’t continue the meditation. Afterwards he feels relaxed. Osho checks his energy.]\nThe problem is simple: you stop breathing when you do it! That’s why you feel so tense.\nYou stop breathing, yes! That’s why it becomes more and more tense and you feel suffocated.\nBe easier about it. Rather than leaning backwards, lean forwards, mm? And start very easily. There is no need to stop breathing. Then it will come flowing like a song. Breathing you have to continue!\nAnd second thing: you are not to go on doing it. Sometimes it will stop because you will be breathing and sometimes it will come again; there will be gaps. You are trying to do it without any gaps; then how can you breathe? There is no time to breathe. Do it more slowly. There is no hurry.\nJust do it. Close your eyes and do it – just any nonsense-sound. Allow it, and then it starts taking its own route; association starts working. One sound reminds one of another, that one reminds one of another and one goes on and on – no language, no meaning, nothing.\nContinue gibberish every day... Not more than twenty minutes. If you enjoy then you can do thirty but not too much. If you breathe then you can do it more easily. But without breathing, even twenty minutes!... Mm, you will kill yourself!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2532","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">24</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2532 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

disappeared.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s very good! That’s how it should be. If you really love me,
just by being in my presence your questions will disappear. There is no
need to ask; th y are answered before you ask. And the presence answers
them far more deeply, far more profoundly.</p><p><br></p><p>To be here means to be in my presence, and without your knowing you
start falling in tune with me. Your state of consciousness is altered,
your level of consciousness becomes different so the questions that
existed on the first level can’t exist on this level. There is every
possibility that when you lose contact with me they will bubble up
again. That will be an indication that you have forgotten me.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried about those questions. Rather, try to contact me
again. And you can invoke my presence anywhere. All that it needs is a
prayerful, loving heart. You can call me anywhere. There is no need for
you to come here to feel my presence; I can come to you. Slowly slowly
all of my sannyasins learn the knack of it.</p><p><br></p><p>And wherever you are, once you have caught me and can feel me, those
questions will disappear immediately. Alone, on your own, you are
nothing but a bundle of questions. To be with me is to become the
answer. So let this experience become very significant to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The real thing is never to solve the questions. The real thing is to
transcend them, to surpass them, to go beyond them, to be in another
kind of reality where those questions do not arise.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference between religion and philosophy. Philosophy
tries to solve the questions, and hence not a single question has been
solved by philosophy. It is an exercise in utter futility. Religion
tries to change the level of consciousness, the state of the mind. There
is a state in which there are questions and there is a state where no
questions exist. Religion has solved all questions without solving a
single one. In fact it solves the questioner.</p><p><br></p><p>To be with me is to be in contact with a living religion. I am not
here to solve your questions; I am here to solve you. If you allow me, I
am not going to destroy your questions – I am going to destroy the
questioner. And it has started happening. Become a little more
courageous and go ahead!</p><p>[A sannyasin says she feels like she is dying. She is working in the
pottery department.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good work! That’s really good work. If you can go deep into
it, no other meditation is needed. It is a great meditation in itself
and it can centre you. So go deep into it.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be worried: you are not dying. You are becoming more alive
– you were dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, of course – as you are, you have to die. You have been dead up
to now; you have to die to that deadness in you. But in fact you are
becoming more alive. It will look like a kind of death in the
beginning.<span class=s4></span>Allow it. And you are in the right
kind of work to help it.</p><p><br></p><p>You wanted to become assistant to Somendra but I didn’t like that
idea, it would not have helped you at all. It would have destroyed your
energy, it would have eaten you up. You would have fallen into
fragments. To be a therapist or to be an assistant to a therapist needs
a different kind of person and you are not that kind of person at all.
But this work is perfectly good for you. Go into it, put all your energy
into it.</p><p><br></p><p>And we are going to make pottery something really big – just a few
days more, mm? – because I love it.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is far better to be with pots than to be with people! Pots are
beautiful people<span class=s4></span>and people are</p><p>just ugly pots!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, guha means a cave – a cave of bliss. It is a
metaphor: it means the heart, the heart is the cave of bliss. Bliss is
hidden in the heart, in the cave of the heart. People go on searching
everywhere else but they never search in the heart; it is there. Hence
everybody is miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>They look around the world, they go to the farthest corners of the
world in search of bliss<span class=s4></span>and it</p><p>is in their heart. That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘The kingdom
of God is within you’; he is indicating the cave Of the heart. So the
message in your name is: look into the heart, go deep into your heart –
all that has to be found is already there, already given. God has given
you already all that you will ever need. All that is needed to become
fulfilled is there; one just has to penetrate one’s own heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Step down from the head. Move more from thinking to feeling, from
logic to love, from prose to poetry. In every way let the heart function
more.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are reading, reading prose, the heart does not function;
then the head is enough. But when you are reading poetry the heart
starts beating, a different rhythm comes to it. The real poetry has
nothing to do with the head – it is illogical. It has immense beauty but
no utility. It has great charm, magic, majesty. You cannot prove it, you
can only enjoy it. And if somebody can enjoy it, he will know, but there
is no way to communicate your joy of poetry to somebody else; it is a
heart thing. And in the same way the whole life is divided between the
head and the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>So always look to what will help your heart to function more and go
towards that. Create all kinds of situations in which the heart starts
functioning. It has not functioned for many lives. It has forgotten to
function. So don’t miss any opportunity. Just come close<span class=s4></span>and start from this moment.</p><p>[A sannyasin reports back about his individual meditation – ‘talking
in tongues.’ He gets stuck at some point: his body becomes tense and he
feels suffocated and then he can’t continue the meditation. Afterwards
he feels relaxed. Osho checks his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is simple: you stop breathing when you do it! That’s why
you feel so tense.</p><p><br></p><p>You stop breathing, yes! That’s why it becomes more and more tense
and you feel suffocated.</p><p><br></p><p>Be easier about it. Rather than leaning backwards, lean forwards, mm?
And start very easily. There is no need to stop breathing. Then it will
come flowing like a song. Breathing you have to continue!</p><p><br></p><p>And second thing: you are not to go on doing it. Sometimes it will
stop because you will be breathing and sometimes it will come again;
there will be gaps. You are trying to do it without any gaps; then how
can you breathe? There is no time to breathe. Do it more slowly. There
is no hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>Just do it. Close your eyes and do it – just any nonsense-sound.
Allow it, and then it starts taking its own route; association starts
working. One sound reminds one of another, that one reminds one of
another and one goes on and on – no language, no meaning, nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Continue gibberish every day... Not more than twenty minutes. If you
enjoy then you can do thirty but not too much. If you breathe then you
can do it more easily. But without breathing, even twenty minutes!...
Mm, you will kill yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Prem means love and trilochana means the third eye – the third eye of love. These two eyes look at the outside, and because they are two, they create a duality, they divide everything into two. There is a third eye – it is a metaphor – which looks inward, and because it is one it does not create any duality, any conflict."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part14/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part14/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="14"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

These two eyes look at the outside, and because they are two, they create a duality, they divide everything into two. There is a third eye – it is a metaphor – which looks inward, and because it is one it does not create any duality, any conflict. It leads to the one. It is a flight of the alone to the alone. Its movement is inwards; it reaches to the innermost core of the being. It goes like an arrow. It is a look into one’s own being or into one’s own nature.\nAnd the whole work here is to make your third eye function. It has gone into a non-functioning state because we have not used it for so long. It is just as if you don’t use your hands for a long time, they will start dying. If you don’t use your eyes for a long time... they say if you live in darkness for three years then you will never be able to see again. Or if you don’t speak for three years continuously you will never be able to speak again because your vocal chords will die. So each centre, whether physical or psychological, needs to be constantly functioning, then it remains alive. Otherwise it withers away. And the third eye we have not used for a long time, for many lives, so it has almost become non-existential.\nPeople go on listening and the masters go on teaching ‘Look within’, ‘Know thyself’, ‘The kingdom of God is within you’, and people listen to all these things but in fact they don’t understand what to do. Where is this inside and how to look inside? Maybe Jesus is right that the kingdom is within, but what does he really mean by ‘within’? – because our whole experience consists of the without. All that we know is without and all that is worth knowing is within. This is the dilemma, the predicament of humanity – that the worthless is available and the real treasure is hidden. In fact it is hidden because it is real treasure. Real treasure has to be hidden, otherwise you will be robbed of it!\nYour name means: the third eye of love. You have a beautiful name there. If you decide you want it to, if you become intent upon it, it will start functioning. And once it starts functioning you enter\ninto a different kind of world, a separate reality. Everything remains the same and yet nothing is the same any more. The same trees become greener and the same people look divine. And small things of life bring such joy, such infinite joy. Just collecting seashells on the sea beach one feels like an emperor. Just standing in the rains, one is thrilled; every pore nf one’s being and every fibre of one’s being dances.\nBut before that can happen, that ecstatic light, one thing is needed: love should start functioning. So keep that in your consciousness, that you have to work towards love... become more loving.\n[A sannyasin says he has difficulty breathing. He also is divided between going into himself and relating, but does not feel open to others.\nOsho checks his energy and suggests that when he wakes each morning he begins by exhaling rather than inhaling, which he must have been doing up to now. People whose emphasis is on inhalation never breathe deeply. Breath is life; the depth of breathing is the depth of life. the people who emphasise in-breathing become closed; they accumulate much carbon dioxide in their lungs.…\n]\nThere are two types of people: the inhalers and the exhalers. The inhalers will be always in this difficulty in which you are, and the exhalers will never be in this difficulty. They will be open, flowing, alive, meeting with people, loving, communicating. Inhalers become isolated, inhalers become monks – they go to the monasteries. They don’t want to go out at all; even that much seems to be such an effort. They want to be closed to the whole world. Inhalers finally can be turned easily into a suicidal state. They go on closing and closing and disappearing into their own world; that creates a kind of morbidity. Avoid it! This is the first thing.\nFor one month make this change and for one month the second thing has not to be tried. After one month you start the second, and that is to meet people, to talk to people – just small-talk, gossiping, holding hands, relating, mixing – but only after one month, not right now. First change your breathing system and after one month start doing the second and the second will come very naturally and very easily. Then report to me how things are.\nEverything will be okay; nothing to be worried about.\n[The sannyasin asks: You mean not to do the second one?]\nNo, not so fast, because first the breathing has to be changed, mm? That will become the foundation. Then the second will be easy. The second can be done right now but it will not be easy. It will be forced and you will feel tired. So start from the foundation.\nFor one month forget about relationships altogether. Then the appetite will also come. And once the emphasis has changed and you have become an exhaler, a relationship is so simple. So for one month don’t bother about the second.\n[A sannyasin says since he came here he has felt too much energy. Osho says he must have been a very lively – and repressed – child. Osho then talks about society’s investment in curbing children’s spontaneous outflow of energy. By and by the pressure is such that children begin to repress themselves. Now that childhood is re-emerging... ]\nThis Buddhafield into which you have entered wants your child back. I am all for the individual and absolutely against the person. I am all for the natural and absolutely against the cultured.\nSo it is happening: the spring has started flowing again, the fountain is bubbling with joy and you must be feeling afraid. The parents in you are feeling afraid.\nAccept the child, enjoy the child. Give it support, because this child is you in reality – it is your reality. It is you, really you. The false is afraid. Let it go to the dogs! And after these three groups remind me again. Slowly slowly you will become able to cope with so much energy. And energy is good, energy is delight, energy is divine. Once energy is released one can become creative. It brings intelligence, creativity, sensitivity; it brings all that is beautiful.\nYou are on the right track – just keep daring. Your parents will pull you back, but say good-bye to them. And once this is settled and there are no more two persons in you – the person and the individual – one becomes integrated. Then one is no more a crowd, there are no longer many voices. There is a single voice and the single voice has power and potential. Then anything is possible. One is entitled to miracles... but only afterwards, when one is an integrated soul. That is the very meaning of the word ‘yogi’: yogi means ‘integrated soul.’\nWait... some really good news is going to happen!\n[A sannyasin says: I’m a sort of a sentimental person. The mind says one thing and heart says something else. Up to now I’ve been always following the heart and am always at a loss.]\nOne has to be very very alert about one thing: there are things in which the heart will be a failure; never listen to the heart about those things. There are things in which the mind will be a failure; don’t listen to the mind about those things. And a clear-cut distinction is needed, otherwise one goes mad. For example, if you are trying to succeed in the world, don’t listen to the heart. In your business don’t listen to the heart, just be your mind. Because the mind is your mathematics; the mind simply means the part that knows how to do big business – nothing else! The mind is your business expert – listen to it!\nWhen you are ill you don’t go and ask an engineer; you go to the doctor. If when you are ill you go to the engineer and when you want to make your house you consult the doctor, you will go crazy. That’s what you have been doing. If you fall in love with a woman then don’t listen to the mind, because the mind has nothing to say about it. It is not a question of logic or mathematics – listen to the heart. If you are reading poetry, listen to the heart. But when you are doing some calculation don’t bring in your heart. This is clarity. It is not a question of being sentimental or not. Just clarity is needed and a clear-cut division of labour. The mind is yours, the heart is yours. Both have their functions and one has to learn what exactly the function of the heart is; otherwise you will get confused and mixed up. So just see: if something needs logic, mathematics, the mind is needed. What will the heart do there?\nWhenever you get confused, listen to the mind. Because confusion means that the mind is needed. The heart never gets confused; it simply knows. Confusion means that it is in the area of the mind. Slowly slowly you will get to the knack.\nDuring these two years that you are in the Middle East, try this: always the first thing to decide is, is this a heart matter or a mind matter? And in life there are almost ninety-nine percent mind matters, rarely a heart matter. But that one percent is more valuable than the ninety-nine percent. And if there is a question of whether to save the ninety-nine percent or to save the one percent, I will say ‘Save the one percent and lose the ninety-nine percent.’ But ordinarily there is no question like that.\nUse your mind more, continue to meditate, and things will become more and more clear.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1744","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1744 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It means: one who sees, the cognizant one, the seeing one. The full name will mean: the divine vision, a divine way of seeing things. And it all depends on how you look at the world. It is your seeing that determines the world. We don’t live in the same world, because our ways of seeing are different. There are as many worlds as there are people, hence the clash. Hence the conflict in love, in friendship, because two ways of seeing can’t agree. They overlap, they collide, they try to manipulate each other, they try to dominate each other, but deep down the fact is that there are two kinds of seeing, and there is a great fight going on about who wins, whose eye proves to be the right eye. Religion is a way of seeing with closed eyes. Science observes with open eyes: it looks out. Religion observes with closed eyes. And when these two eyes are closed, absolutely closed, a third eye opens inside – that is ‘Khabiro.’ These two eyes create a duality, so whatsoever you see is always divided into two.\nFor example: what you call love and hate is one energy; it is not two energies, it is one energy. There is no division in it. But when you see with two eyes, it looks as if there is love and hate. There is only love/hate, there is only darkness/light, not darkness and light. There is only cold/hot, not cold and hot. That ‘and’ is created by the two eyes. The whole reality becomes divided. These two eyes function like a prism in which the ray enters and becomes divided into seven colours. It was pure white. When it was one, undivided, it was pure white. When it is divided it is so many colours – it is no more white, it is no more one.\nTurning in, there is a third eye. These two eyes meet at a point deep within you. They will never meet outside; they can’t meet there. The farther away you look, the farther away they are; the closer you come, the closer they are. When you close your eyes they have become one. That is ‘Khabiro’, and that one eye can see the reality as it is. It is seeing without seeing. It is seeing without any medium. It is uncorrupted seeing. All those seven colours have fallen into one and become white again.\nPeople are very interested in having beautiful eyes. Rather, they should be interested more in having a beautiful way of looking at things. Rather than having beautiful eyes, have a beautiful vision. See beautifully. See the one, the undivided, the eternal – -that’s what I mean when I say ‘See beautifully.’ And it is possible. It is within our grasp; it is just that we have never tried to attain it. We have never looked at the potential at all. We have never worked out the possibility to its actuality. It has remained like a seed. The third eye hai remained like a seed.\nOnce your energy enters and falls on the third eye, it starts opening; it becomes a lotus, it blooms. And suddenly your whole life-pattern is changed. You are a different person. You are no more the same; you can never be the same again and the world can never be the same. Everything is the same and yet nothing will ever be the same again. You have attained to a single eye. Jesus says ‘Have the single eye and then you will know what God is.’\nThis is going to be your work: meditate more and more with closed eyes, try more and more to see in. In the beginning it is difficult. It is very dark there, because we have forgotten even how to look in. It has been neglected, ignored. Slowly, slowly, the rocks of old habits will be broken and you will be able to feel, grasp, grope, and slowly slowly you will become adjusted and you will be able to see it.\nFirst it will be utter darkness. It is just as when you come in from outside where it was hot and sunny. You enter your room and it is dark and you cannot see for a few seconds; then the eyes get adjusted. Slowly slowly the room is not so dark; slowly slowly, it is full of light.\nThe same is the case in the inner. For the time being everything will become dark, but if you persist – and persistence is meditation – if you are patient – and patience is meditation, if you go on digging and digging, one day you stumble upon the source of your energy. Suddenly darkness disappears and it is all light – and such a grandeur and such a splendour that one cannot even dream about it.\n[A sannyasin, leaving for three months to earn money, says he feels sad to leave.]\nSo don’t be worried – three months is not a problem, not a problem. Sometimes it is good to be away from here, sometimes very very good and essential for your growth. Otherwise one starts taking me for granted and becomes oblivious.\nThere are many people here who have forgotten me just because they are here and I am available; whenever they want, they can come. So they have become occupied in a thousand other things. I am here, available, so there is no question about it. Why not do other things first ?\nIf they go away, suddenly they will feel that they are missing me. Then everything else will become insignificant and their whole mind will start turning towards me. And that’s what is needed. It is very natural, nothing is wrong in it; it is very natural. Mm ? just the fish in the ocean forgets the ocean; take the fish out and then it knows. This is an energy field – that’s what I am; it is a kind of invisible ocean.\nYou tend to forget me. You become much more concerned about other things. You find a girlfriend and then you are much concerned about the girlfriend. There are a thousand and one trips one can go on, and I am always there, so slowly slowly you tend not to see me.\nWe see only the new, the novel. We see only the changing; the constant is forgotten. You come in your room and everything is in its place – you will not see anything. But if something is not in its place, you will immediately see it. The table has been removed, the clock is not there, the picture on the wall is missing. You have not looked at that picture for ten years – it has been there and there and there; you knew it was there. There are people who have not seen their wife’s face for years. If they will look they will be surprised at how much the woman has changed, because they have the idea of the woman that they used to know ten years ago when they had fallen in love. Then they were looking at her face; they were thrilled by her face. They are still carrying that old picture and they still think she is that woman. She is not! Much water has flown down the Ganges; ten years is a long time – she is getting old. If they look at their own wife’s face they will be surprised – who is this woman? They don’t seem to recognise her.\nThis is natural. That’s how the mind functions: one takes things for granted. When they are there, they are there; then the mind takes no note of it. Sometimes it is very good to go far away from me. Then you will know the significance of being close to me, the value of my presence and the value of your relationship to me. Otherwise I am constantly watching people: they come for me and then they get trapped in something else. Somebody falls in love, somebody else starts some business and somebody starts doing something else. They become so obsessed by it that their whole energy starts turning away from me... and they came for me!\nBut people are accidental. They don’t know what they are doing – they are not very conscious of what is happening. And when they go away, suddenly they become aware, because then only will they miss me. Here, even if you are not consciously relating with me, I am showering on you. Even if it is one-way, it continues... and more often it is one-way. But I go on hoping that some day you will respond, that some day you will realise.…\nSo these three months will be of great help, of immense help, of great clarity. And the relationship that you are in, this disciplehood, will take a new shape, a new form. Don’t be worried. Go, and you will be enriched by it, and when you come back you will find yourself coming closer to me, more consciously. I would like now that it becomes a two-way exchange. It rarely becomes one, but when it does, only then do things start happening. Otherwise I go on giving to you and you go on absorbing it too, your growth continues, but it could have been a thousandfold if you had responded consciously.\nSo take it as an opportunity, as a device from me. Go, be there for three months, work hard and come back!\n[A sannyasin says he is apprehensive about earning money in the west, because he has never enjoyed his work as a dentist, but he needs to pay tax arrears before returning here forever.]\nMy feeling is you will not feel good without paying it. There are people who won’t have any trouble, but about you my feeling is that you won’t feel good; you will feel guilty. You will feel a burden on yourself – that you have done something you should not have done. So it is better to pay it; otherwise it will hang around you. Mm, if you have to be there one month more, be there; just one month or two months doesn’t make much difference. It is better to clear everything, to finish and close everything and come completely clean of the past. Mm, this will remain hanging in your mind. And these are the things that keep people from growing.\nIt is really not a question of morality. I am amoral, mm? – I don’t think much of morality or immorality; those are irrelevant. But there is something deeper than morality that is involved.\nThe question is that if you don’t do a certain thing you will remain hooked there. A part of you will remain hooked there, and if a part is hooked in the past you cannot move in the future. You are undivided you are one, so if something is hanging there, two years back, you will remain there. It will be very difficult to use those two years to grow. That’s why people are hung up somewhere near around thirteen, fourteen. That is people’s average mental age.\nThe person may be eighty but his age, his mental age, is fourteen. This is a very sorry state of things. So he remains juvenile, childish. To be child-like is one thing and to be childish is another. To be child-like has beauty and to be childish is just ugly.\nSo to me it is not a question of morality – no question is of morality. To me the only question is of growth: whatsoever helps you to grow is good to do and whatsoever prevents your growth is good to avoid. So just for one month’s work don’t bring that burden on your head; just clean the slate.\nAnd don’t try to find rationalisations – they won’t help – that the government is going to purchase missiles, or bombs will be created and they are going to kill people, so what is the point of giving them money? If you had not told me this, I would feel it would have been easier for you not to pay your income tax. This is a rationalisation and simply shows that you are feeling guilty. Unless one feels guilty, one never rationalises. One simply doesn’t care! You could even not have asked about it – it would not have been a problem at all. But that would have been another thing; then it would be okay, nothing matters.\nBut that is not true for you. You are trying to find a rationalisation so you can repress your guilt feeling. You can say ’Any day they are going to destroy people by this money – why should I pay? That is just trying to hide the wounds, but the wound is there.\nJust go and pay everything and finish everything. It is always good to feel that everything is clear and done fast, so you come back with more clarity, with more transparency.…\n[A sannyasin says that when Osho comes in to discourse in the morning she gets a pain in her shoulders, which is relieved only by kneeling, with her head down. Osho checks her energy.]\nDo it the moment I enter; don’t wait for the pain to come. Mm, it is something beautiful; nothing wrong in it. But you do it immediately, the moment I start; don’t wait for it to come.\nIt is simply an indication that the body wants to go into that posture and you resist, hence the pain, and naturally one... You try to the very last: when it becomes impossible to bear, then you bow down. But that bowing down is one of the beautiful postures of receptivity, of surrender, of let-go. That’s just how my energy is functioning on you.\nSo start it, the moment I come, the first thing. Just look at me, then you can go into your posture. That is the womb posture and you are doing it perfectly well. It has to be done. Because you try not to do it, the pain comes and then you do it. So do it from the very beginning and you will feel very relaxed.\nAnd don’t be worried that you have to listen to what I am saying; you have to absorb, not listen. You have to absorb my presence. Listening is superficial; it is a communication between two minds. Now you can commune with my energy and that is far deeper. The body and your whole energy wants to communicate on that level – it is ready. So just go into the posture and rest in it. Even in darshan when you come, just look at me and go into it.\nAnd a few things.… Take care of your body. Stop eating outside, because now you will have to take care; otherwise this energy will create trouble. You have to be very careful you can’t eat each and every thing, not in the market. Just eat things which one can depend on as being perfectly okay – fruits, vegetables, milk. Avoid any heavy things, then the energy will start flowing more and more. When it is absolutely necessary – when you go to Bombay – it is okay, but avoid as much as possible. And there too depend on fruits and vegetablesOtherwise everything is going well!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2608","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">26</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2608 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

sees, the cognizant one, the seeing one. The full name will mean: the
divine vision, a divine way of seeing things. And it all depends on how
you look at the world. It is your seeing that determines the world. We
don’t live in the same world, because our ways of seeing are different.
There are as many worlds as there are people, hence the clash. Hence the
conflict in love, in friendship, because two ways of seeing can’t agree.
They overlap, they collide, they try to manipulate each other, they try

energies, it is one energy. There is no division in it. But when you see
with two eyes, it looks as if there is love and hate. There is only
love/hate, there is only darkness/light, not darkness and light. There
is only cold/hot, not cold and hot. That ‘and’ is created by the two
eyes. The whole reality becomes divided. These two eyes function like a
prism in which the ray enters and becomes divided into seven colours. It
was pure white. When it was one, undivided, it was pure white. When it

farther away you look, the farther away they are; the closer you come,
the closer they are. When you close your eyes they have become one. That
is ‘Khabiro’, and that one eye can see the reality as it is. It is
seeing without seeing. It is seeing without any medium. It is
uncorrupted seeing. All those seven colours have fallen into one and
become white again.</p><p>People are very interested in having beautiful eyes. Rather, they
should be interested more in having a beautiful way of looking at

she is getting old. If they look at their own wife’s face they will be
surprised – who is this woman? They don’t seem to recognise her.</p><p><br></p><p>This is natural. That’s how the mind functions: one takes things for
granted. When they are there, they are there; then the mind takes no
note of it. Sometimes it is very good to go far away from me. Then you
will know the significance of being close to me, the value of my
presence and the value of your relationship to me. Otherwise I am
constantly watching people: they come for me and then they get trapped
in something else. Somebody falls in love, somebody else starts some
business and somebody starts doing something else. They become so
obsessed by it that their whole energy starts turning away from me...
and they came for me!</p><p><br></p><p>But people are accidental. They don’t know what they are doing – they
are not very conscious of what is happening. And when they go away,
suddenly they become aware, because then only will they miss me. Here,
even if you are not consciously relating with me, I am showering on you.
Even if it is one-way, it continues... and more often it is one-way. But
I go on hoping that some day you will respond, that some day you will
realise.…</p><p><br></p><p>So these three months will be of great help, of immense help, of
great clarity. And the relationship that you are in, this disciplehood,
will take a new shape, a new form. Don’t be worried. Go, and you will be
enriched by it, and when you come back you will find yourself coming
closer to me, more consciously. I would like now that it becomes a
two-way exchange. It rarely becomes one, but when it does, only then do
things start happening. Otherwise I go on giving to you and you go on
absorbing it too, your growth continues, but it could have been a
thousandfold if you had responded consciously.</p><p><br></p><p>So take it as an opportunity, as a device from me. Go, be there for
three months, work hard and come back!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he is apprehensive about earning money in the west,
because he has never enjoyed his work as a dentist, but he needs to pay
tax arrears before returning here forever.]</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is you will not feel good without paying it. There are
people who won’t have any trouble, but about you my feeling is that you
won’t feel good; you will feel guilty. You will feel a burden on
yourself – that you have done something you should not have done. So it
is better to pay it; otherwise it will hang around you. Mm, if you have
to be there one month more, be there; just one month or two months
doesn’t make much difference. It is better to clear everything, to
finish and close everything and come completely clean of the past. Mm,
this will remain hanging in your mind. And these are the things that
keep people from growing.</p><p>It is really not a question of morality. I am amoral, mm? – I don’t
think much of morality or immorality; those are irrelevant. But there is
something deeper than morality that is involved.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is that if you don’t do a certain thing you will remain
hooked there. A part of you will remain hooked there, and if a part is
hooked in the past you cannot move in the future. You are undivided you
are one, so if something is hanging there, two years back, you will
remain there. It will be very difficult to use those two years to grow.
That’s why people are hung up somewhere near around thirteen, fourteen.
That is people’s average mental age.</p><p><br></p><p>The person may be eighty but his age, his mental age, is fourteen.
This is a very sorry state of things. So he remains juvenile, childish.
To be child-like is one thing and to be childish is another. To be
child-like has beauty and to be childish is just ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>So to me it is not a question of morality – no question is of
morality. To me the only question is of growth: whatsoever helps you to
grow is good to do and whatsoever prevents your growth is good to avoid.
So just for one month’s work don’t bring that burden on your head; just
clean the slate.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t try to find rationalisations – they won’t help – that the
government is going to purchase missiles, or bombs will be created and
they are going to kill people, so what is the point of giving them
money? If you had not told me this, I would feel it would have been
easier for you not to pay your income tax. This is a rationalisation and
simply shows that you are feeling guilty. Unless one feels guilty, one
never rationalises. One simply doesn’t care! You could even not have
asked about it – it would not have been a problem at all. But that would
have been another thing; then it would be okay, nothing matters.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not true for you. You are trying to find a
rationalisation so you can repress your guilt feeling. You can say ’Any
day they are going to destroy people by this money – why should I pay?
That is just trying to hide the wounds, but the wound is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go and pay everything and finish everything. It is always good
to feel that everything is clear and done fast, so you come back with
more clarity, with more transparency.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says that when Osho comes in to discourse in the morning
she gets a pain in her shoulders, which is relieved only by kneeling,
with her head down. Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Do it the moment I enter; don’t wait for the pain to come. Mm, it is
something beautiful; nothing wrong in it. But you do it immediately, the
moment I start; don’t wait for it to come.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply an indication that the body wants to go into that
posture and you resist, hence the pain, and naturally one... You try to
the very last: when it becomes impossible to bear, then you bow down.
But that bowing down is one of the beautiful postures of receptivity, of
surrender, of let-go. That’s just how my energy is functioning on
you.</p><p><br></p><p>So start it, the moment I come, the first thing. Just look at me,
then you can go into your posture. That is the womb posture and you are
doing it perfectly well. It has to be done. Because you try not to do
it, the pain comes and then you do it. So do it from the very beginning
and you will feel very relaxed.</p><p>And don’t be worried that you have to listen to what I am saying; you
have to absorb, not listen. You have to absorb my presence. Listening is
superficial; it is a communication between two minds. Now you can
commune with my energy and that is far deeper. The body and your whole
energy wants to communicate on that level – it is ready. So just go into
the posture and rest in it. Even in darshan when you come, just look at
me and go into it.</p><p><br></p><p>And a few things.… Take care of your body. Stop eating outside,
because now you will have to take care; otherwise this energy will
create trouble. You have to be very careful you can’t eat each and every
thing, not in the market. Just eat things which one can depend on as
being perfectly okay – fruits, vegetables, milk. Avoid any heavy things,
then the energy will start flowing more and more. When it is absolutely
necessary – when you go to Bombay – it is okay, but avoid as much as
possible. And there too depend on fruits and vegetables<span class=s4></span>Otherwise everything is going well!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

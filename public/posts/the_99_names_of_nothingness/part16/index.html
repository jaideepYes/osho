Prem means love and Hasibo is a sufi name for God. It means: one who satisfies all needs. The full name will mean: love, the god that satisfies all needs.\nAnd love is the ultimate need. Everything else is secondary. Everything else is just a means to that great end. If love happens then all has happened; if love does not happen then nothing has happened, the whole of life has just been a wasteland.\nAnd it is very rare that love blooms, because the soil that the society provides is not adequate for it. In fact, it obstructs it. It poisons the seed. It teaches people to be full of hate, anger, ambition, possessiveness.\nSociety is founded not on love but on hate. It depends on struggle, violence, war. It can’t afford love. Love will take away the whole foundation on which it stands. For millions of years society has remained that way. And unless society’s foundation is changed, it will not become a really human phenomenon. It will remain something between the animal and the man, a half-way house. Society goes on carrying all the violence that is there in the animals and has dropped all the love that is there. In terms of heart, it is not evolution; it is a degradation. And as far as that is concerned, christians are right – that man has fallen from grace, that man has committed some original sin.\nI may not agree with their details about what sin man has committed – I may not agree, but some sin has been committed. The whole of society has taken a wrong direction. The direction has to be changed, and one has to begin with oneself because there is no other beginning; you cannot begin with the other.\nTake the risk of being in love with existence. It is risky because nobody will support you. It is risky because even your own mind will be against it. It is risky because you will fail, fail utterly in this world\nand the ways of this world. But to fail in the ways of the world is to succeed in the eyes of God. That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Those who are the first in this life will be the last in my kingdom of God,’ and vice versa. The person who succeeds in a hateful society succeeds because he is more violent than others, more cunning than others, more clever, more manipulating, more pseudo, than others. He succeeds only by selling his soul. And only the man who cannot succeed in this life can succeed in the other. Yes, those who are the last will be the first. And lovers are the last here. They lose all but they protect the most precious thing.\nSo become more loving and remember that if you love, God is always there to satisfy all your needs. Trust, and whatsoever is needed is always given. If it is not given, that simply shows it is not needed.\nSometimes pain is needed, then pain is given. Sometimes shocks are needed, so shocks are given. And sometimes it is sadness, misery, that brings maturity – then it is given. Sometimes it is poverty that brings to inner richness, then it is given. But always remember: whatsoever is given, is needed, and whatsoever is needed, is always given. That is the meaning of ‘Hasibo’: become love and become trust.\nAnd I have been waiting for you for a long time!\nYou have come home. You have knocked on many doors in vain – now let this door be the last.…\nPrem Raufa. Prem means love, Raufa is a sufi name for God. It means: one who has compassion, the compassionate. Your full name will mean: love, compassion.\nCompassion is the fragrance of love. Love is like the flower and compassion is like the fragrance. There are flowers with no fragrance at all; they are poor flowers. Unless a flower has fragrance it is not much of a flower, because it does not give anything to the world, it does not release its spirit into the world. It is lacking, something is missing. In a certain way it is very non-poetic, hard. It does not have the soft heart and the subtle vibe. It is more on the outside and there is nothing inside it. It has no interiority, it has no subjectivity. The fragrance simply shows the heart of the flower – the hidden becomes manifest, and that is the ultimate.\nThe seed is one stage. One can die as a seed. The seed is sex and many people die as the seed. Love is like a flower: the seed has bloomed, has come to express its colour, its possibilities. But many people die as flowers, as love. Compassion is when the flower releases its fragrance; then the growth is complete. When sex reaches to compassion one has arrived.\nBuddha has said that compassion is the criterion. Love is just in the middle between sex and compassion. Below it is the world of the animal, above it is the world of gods. Love is just in the middle – a door, a threshold. Start with love but don’t stop there. It is beautiful as a beginning but not as an end. The end should be compassion. Become Raufa, become compassionate.\n[A sannyasin, who has been learning dance in the west, says she is divided between returning to study and staying with Osho.]\nSo you can continue here and you can start teaching here. And dance is not really a thing to be learned. It is not an art; rather, it is a meditation. To think in terms of art is to miss the whole point.\nYou can learn it technically and you can become a technical dancer, but you will miss the reality of it. It will be just the body and the soul will be missing. The soul comes through being meditative. The dance is not the real thing, but a dancing soul! Then the body moves of its own accord. You can make the body move but the soul will not move. The centre never follows the circumference but the circumference always follows the centre.\nTwo years is enough to learn the know-how. Now it is time to go ahead on your own. So come back, dance, help people to dance, and develop your own style, develop your own ways, develop your own technique. One has to be innovative. People try to be imitative. Learning from somebody else is good in the beginning. A little bit of information is helpful, it prepares your body, but one should not be too much attached to it.\nIn zen they say that if you really want to become a painter, first go and learn how to paint and then throw your brush, your colours, your canvas, for years together, so that you can forget what you have learned. Then one day suddenly, start painting. First learn how to paint, forget how to paint, then one day, start painting. Then it will have the quality of innocence and yet deep down somewhere the quality of an expert artist too. It is a great synthesis.\nOne can just start painting and then the painting will be simply childish, as many modern paintings are – juvenile, no art in them... more pathological than healthy. Or one can technically become a very very efficient artist; then everything is perfect but the soul is missing. One has to attain to a synthesis: one has to know the technique and one has to be capable of being free of the technique. Then something in you starts growing, something takes form – something that is yours and can only be yours, something that has your signature on it.\nThat’s why I suggested that you come as soon as possibleStart exploring dance here. Dance,\nteach dancing, innovate, discover, rather than follow.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says he is continually bored and nothing seems worth doing.] If one is really bored, one gets out of boredom. You are not completely bored yet!\nYou are still hoping that there may be some way out of it.and there is none if you ask the truth,\nthere is no way out of it. Because you go on trying to find some way out and then it fails, you become more bored – but only more, not totally bored. Then you start looking in some other direction. Again, for a few days you will feel a little hope, and then the failure. And it will go on and on. Every time you will have a dream that this seems to succeed. For a few days the honeymoon and then you are flat on your back again.\nIf you want to know the truth, there is no way out. That means: stop trying to get out of it. Start living in it – accept it, embrace it. This is what life is: life is a boredom. Then suddenly you are out and you are not searching for any way out – you are suddenly out. What to do? Life is such. This is Buddha’s message; he calls it ‘suchness’. Life is such.\nI am also bored!\nBut I have accepted it! And since I accepted it I got out of it!\nAccept it and just see – it disappears. It is a creation of your mind: because you want to get out of it, you create it. First one expects something and it doesn’t happen, then frustration. But the frustration is the secondary thing; the first and the primary is the seed, is expectation. If you really want to get out of frustration, just drop the expectation. Then how can you be frustrated? How can anybody force you to be frustrated ? It is impossible. But we go on working on the second thing and the first is the cause. We go on working on the symptom and the cause remains intact.\nStop looking for a way out. There is none. This is how life is. To get it is to become enlightened. So when will you be coming back?...\nWhenever it is possible, come. And I will make you more bored, more bored! Some day, when the cup is full, you will be out of it. It happens in a single instant.\nThen the laughter never ceases; one goes on laughing because then one sees the whole ridiculousness of it. One was creating it and was trying to get rid of it! On one hand we create it, on the other hand we destroy it, so the process can never be complete. You come back! You are coming closer and closer to the point where you will accept it. Good!\n[A sannyasin says she doesn’t know if she is coming or going... she has been travelling between here, Goa and Bombay. She is not working in the ashram or involved in groups.]\nNobody knows if they are coming or going; it is so difficult. Go! It is some karma you have to fulfill!\nGet involved in something otherwise you will feel like going. That’s what you need: some involvement is needed. Start doing some work, but get involved. Otherwise the mind will say ‘Go here, go there,’ and it is useless – just wasting time, mm? And don’t be clever with me. Otherwise you will miss – then don’t ask why. Many people go on doing that and then the problem is not solved, because when I give you groups I have certain ideas about why a certain group will be helpful to you. I know from where to start and in what sequence they have to be done.\nWhen you choose you simply choose because people are saying that Leela is great. Leela is great, but the people who are saying it have not chosen it the way you have. They have followed my instructions, they have followed them step by step. I had given them six, seven groups, then I had given them Leela, and they say it is beautiful, great. You choose it out of greed. You will not gain much out of it, because one has to come to a certain build-up.\nEverything should be done in the right order, and the order differs with each individual; otherwise I could fix it that first everybody has to do this, then this, then that. But with every individual it is different, the needs are different.\nSo whenever you feel like doing some groups, do a few more, mm? I will give you some. [A sannyasin, arriving, says she is happy – she likes being here.]\nThat’s good. You will become more and more happy. It is always good to start with happiness, because whatsoever you have goes on growing.\nAlways remember a very great statement of Jesus: ‘Those who have, more will be given to them, and those who don’t have, even that which they have will be taken away from them.’ Riches attract more riches, so a miserable person attracts all kinds of misery; then it becomes a vicious circle. Always start with happiness, joy, blissfulness, and the whole world starts pouring more bliss, more happiness, more bliss, more joy into you. But the first step has to be taken by you, the initiation is always from your side. Once the process starts, the existence collaborates. Sing a song and the whole existence sings with you. Yes, the old proverb is right: Laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone.\nI am happy. You are starting with a beautiful phenomenon inside your heart – this is the right beginning. and from the right beginning the end is never far away. the basic question is never of the end but of the right beginning.\n[Osho gives a ‘come close energy darshan’ to someone arriving.]\nBeautiful things are happening inside. Many flowers are on the way. The spring is close by – be ready and open for it. Remain vulnerable, and whatsoever happens, allow it. Don’t be afraid of the unknown, because all that is going to happen will be unknown to you. You are on the threshold of a very unknown space. You will not be able to figure out what is what; you will have to go into the darkness of it. But that darkness, once you enter into it, becomes luminous. It is dark only if you don’t enter it. It remains dark because you are out of it. Once you trust it and go into it, great luminosity arises out of it. And when the night turns into day and death turns into life, one has seen that which is worth seeing. One has seen the meeting of the paradoxes.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2494","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2494 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

an expert artist too. It is a great synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>One can just start painting and then the painting will be simply
childish, as many modern paintings are – juvenile, no art in them...
more pathological than healthy. Or one can technically become a very
very efficient artist; then everything is perfect but the soul is
missing. One has to attain to a synthesis: one has to know the technique
and one has to be capable of being free of the technique. Then something
in you starts growing, something takes form – something that is yours
and can only be yours, something that has your signature on it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I suggested that you come as soon as possible<span class=s4></span>Start exploring dance here. Dance,</p><p>teach dancing, innovate, discover, rather than follow.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, says he is continually bored and nothing seems
worth doing.] If one is really bored, one gets out of boredom. You are
not completely bored yet!</p><p>You are still hoping that there may be some way out of it.<span class=s4></span>and there is none if you ask the truth,</p><p>there is no way out of it. Because you go on trying to find some way
out and then it fails, you become more bored – but only more, not
totally bored. Then you start looking in some other direction. Again,
for a few days you will feel a little hope, and then the failure. And it
will go on and on. Every time you will have a dream that this seems to
succeed. For a few days the honeymoon and then you are flat on your back
again.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to know the truth, there is no way out. That means: stop
trying to get out of it. Start living in it – accept it, embrace it.
This is what life is: life is a boredom. Then suddenly you are out and
you are not searching for any way out – you are suddenly out. What to
do? Life is such. This is Buddha’s message; he calls it ‘suchness’. Life
is such.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also bored!</p><p><br></p><p>But I have accepted it! And since I accepted it I got out of it!</p><p>Accept it and just see – it disappears. It is a creation of your
mind: because you want to get out of it, you create it. First one
expects something and it doesn’t happen, then frustration. But the
frustration is the secondary thing; the first and the primary is the
seed, is expectation. If you really want to get out of frustration, just
drop the expectation. Then how can you be frustrated? How can anybody
force you to be frustrated ? It is impossible. But we go on working on
the second thing and the first is the cause. We go on working on the
symptom and the cause remains intact.</p><p><br></p><p>Stop looking for a way out. There is none. This is how life is. To
get it is to become enlightened. So when will you be coming back?...</p><p>Whenever it is possible, come. And I will make you more bored, more
bored! Some day, when the cup is full, you will be out of it. It happens
in a single instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the laughter never ceases; one goes on laughing because then one
sees the whole ridiculousness of it. One was creating it and was trying
to get rid of it! On one hand we create it, on the other hand we destroy
it, so the process can never be complete. You come back! You are coming
closer and closer to the point where you will accept it. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she doesn’t know if she is coming or going... she
has been travelling between here, Goa and Bombay. She is not working in
the ashram or involved in groups.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody knows if they are coming or going; it is so difficult. Go! It
is some karma you have to fulfill!</p><p>Get involved in something otherwise you will feel like going. That’s
what you need: some involvement is needed. Start doing some work, but
get involved. Otherwise the mind will say ‘Go here, go there,’ and it is
useless – just wasting time, mm? And don’t be clever with me. Otherwise
you will miss – then don’t ask why. Many people go on doing that and
then the problem is not solved, because when I give you groups I have
certain ideas about why a certain group will be helpful to you. I know
from where to start and in what sequence they have to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>When you choose you simply choose because people are saying that
Leela is great. Leela is great, but the people who are saying it have
not chosen it the way you have. They have followed my instructions, they
have followed them step by step. I had given them six, seven groups,
then I had given them Leela, and they say it is beautiful, great. You
choose it out of greed. You will not gain much out of it, because one
has to come to a certain build-up.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything should be done in the right order, and the order differs
with each individual; otherwise I could fix it that first everybody has
to do this, then this, then that. But with every individual it is
different, the needs are different.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you feel like doing some groups, do a few more, mm? I
will give you some. [A sannyasin, arriving, says she is happy – she
likes being here.]</p><p>That’s good. You will become more and more happy. It is always good
to start with happiness, because whatsoever you have goes on
growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember a very great statement of Jesus: ‘Those who have,
more will be given to them, and those who don’t have, even that which
they have will be taken away from them.’ Riches attract more riches, so
a miserable person attracts all kinds of misery; then it becomes a
vicious circle. Always start with happiness, joy, blissfulness, and the
whole world starts pouring more bliss, more happiness, more bliss, more
joy into you. But the first step has to be taken by you, the initiation
is always from your side. Once the process starts, the existence
collaborates. Sing a song and the whole existence sings with you. Yes,
the old proverb is right: Laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and
you weep alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I am happy. You are starting with a beautiful phenomenon inside your
heart – this is the right beginning. and from the right beginning the
end is never far away. the basic question is never of the end but of the
right beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives a ‘come close energy darshan’ to someone arriving.]</p><p><br></p><p>Beautiful things are happening inside. Many flowers are on the way.
The spring is close by – be ready and open for it. Remain vulnerable,
and whatsoever happens, allow it. Don’t be afraid of the unknown,
because all that is going to happen will be unknown to you. You are on
the threshold of a very unknown space. You will not be able to figure
out what is what; you will have to go into the darkness of it. But that
darkness, once you enter into it, becomes luminous. It is dark only if
you don’t enter it. It remains dark because you are out of it. Once you
trust it and go into it, great luminosity arises out of it. And when the
night turns into day and death turns into life, one has seen that which
is worth seeing. One has seen the meeting of the paradoxes.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

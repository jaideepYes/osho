Your full name will mean: a loving capacity to hear all. And if one can really hear, nothing else is needed. If one can hear the wind passing through the trees, that is gospel. If one can hear the birds singing in the morning, one has heard prayer. If one can hear the waterfall and its sound and the roaring waves of the ocean, one has heard the sound of the cosmos. These are all the ways God is trying to approach you, to call you... these are all invocations.\nBut man has become deaf and blind and heartless. We don’t feel any more. Even when we feel, we only think that we feel. And we don’t hear any more, because to hear something one doesn’t need only the ears; one needs a feeling heart behind it. We don’t see any more, because unless the heart is standing there, close to the windows of your eyes, you will not be able to see that which is. The form is seen but the formless is missed. The word is heard but the wordless is missed. And that is the true being – the formless, the wordless.\nSo become more and more loving and more and more capable of listening to existence. I am giving the name to you as a meditation. Your satori, your experience of light, will come through the ears not through the eyes. Enlightenment happens in two ways – either through the eyes or through the ears. To a few people it happens as a vision: they see it. To a few people it happens through the ears: they hear it. The founder of islam, Mohammed, heard it; Moses saw it, so their approach becomes totally different. You will be able to hear it, and the name will remind you again and again that it is through the ears that God will knock on your door. So become more and more sound-conscious, become more and more musical. Develop the musical ear. Listen to nuances of sounds, subtle sounds... and they are always there. Listening to them, hearing them and becoming more and more alert of the subtleties of sound, you will become silent. When one is really able to listen, one suddenly falls into deep silence. All thinking stops, the mind disappears.\n[The new sannyasin says that she wants to live with her boyfriend, a sannyasin, but she is afraid that in doing so she will lose her freedom. This has always happened to her in the past.]\nI think it will not happen this time. To fall in love with a sannyasin is a totally different experience. It is crazy but it has its own beauty. It will not happen unless you create it; then there will be trouble. My sannyasins won’t try to possess and destroy your freedom. That’s my whole teaching to them.\nBut you have to watch your old pattern too, because sometimes it might happen that the other is not imposing himself on you but you think he is because of your past experiences. Or you may provoke him to do it again because that is what you expect and if it doesn’t happen you will wonder if something is missing.\nYou may start thinking that maybe he does not love you because you have only known people who love and then immediately start making you a prisoner and a slave, so love and being possessed become almost synonymous.\nAll those experiences you have passed through were not of love. Love brings freedom and anything that destroys freedom cannot be love, is not love. This should be the criterion: if you are really in love and someone is in love with you, your freedom will grow, will grow in bounds and leaps. The ultimate state of love is freedom, absolute freedom, and any relationship that destroys freedom is not worthwhile. Drop out of it.\nIt is better to be alone and free. If one can be free and together, that has a beauty. If it is not possible, be alone. But never lose your freedom. Freedom is far more important than anything else in life. Freedom is your very soul, is your door to God.…\nRaqib. A sufi name for God, it means: one who watches all, one who is a witness to the whole. And this is what everyone has to become: a witness, a watcher. The more watchful you become, the more you are. The intensity in watchfulness becomes your intensity in being. A man who lives asleep has no soul, he simply vegetates.\nIt is difficult to watch because for millions of lives we have lived in sleep, walked in sleep – we are all sleepwalkers. Even to remain continuously watchful for a single minute is difficult. Just three, four, five seconds will pass and you will forget: you will slip into a dream or into a thought, into a side-track. Again you will remember after a few seconds, ‘What am I .doing? I was watching!’ But if one persists, slowly slowly the skill grows. It is a knack like swimming, like driving a car. In the beginning it is difficult, looks almost impossible to manage. And this is the most difficult of all the arts.\nSo start being watchful. Walking, see yourself as walking. Just see yourself from the innermost core as walking. Eating, sec yourself as eating. Listening right now, see yourself as listening... and there will be an immediate change. Then listening is done by the brain mechanism and you are standing deeply hidden behind just witnessing it, watching it.\nLet this watchfulness be spread all over your life. In the morning, from the first moment you become aware that you are awake, start watching. To the last moment at night go on watching and watching till you fall asleep. And one day it happens that you fall asleep and still watching continues; and that\nis a miracle. Then you know that you are not the body at all – the body can go to sleep and you can go on watching, that even in sleep you are no more asleep.\nRight now even when you are awake you are asleep. Then, even while asleep you will be awake. And that moment when you are asleep and yet awake is the moment of great clarity.\nSo this is going to be your method.\n[A sannyasin says she feels Osho has been hammering on her head the whole time, so many things have been happening, with relationships... ]\nI have been hammering, that’s true. But you have been dodging me, that too is true.\nDon’t dodge! When I hit you with a hammer, just bow down to it. The hammer will fall on you like a flower. If you dodge, you will suffer. It is not the hammer that hits you; it is your dodging. It is your cleverness that hits you hard and harms you and becomes unbearable. Otherwise the hammer that I am hitting with is made of flowers. It is just roses and roses and roses.\nBut you will only know its rose quality, its fragrance and its delicacy, if you bow down to it. Suddenly it is no more a hammer – it is a great blessing, a benediction.\nBut everybody dodges a little bit, mm? People try all kinds of cleverness. They have learned many tricks in life and naturally they play those tricks with me to... not knowingly, not consciously. Then they feel hurt and then it becomes unbearable.\nBut you cannot escape; there is nowhere to go. Even if you go, I will follow. And the farther away you go, the closer you will find me.\n[She says she is not doing anything now, being lazy.]\nAnd are you alone now? (she nods) Be alone – don’t be worried; sometimes it is very very life- enhancing to be alone. But it will be good if you start doing some work. Come out of your laziness.\nMm, come out of it. Start doing some work in the ashram or somewhere – pottery, weaving – anywhere, wherever you feel like, but start doing something. And I will continue hammering; don’t be worried!\n[A sannyasin had previously written to Osho and now reminds him: I felt really crazy one day. I was just laughing and crying, and rolling around on the floor.…\nOsho checks her energy.]\nIt is really good. Don’t call it wild; it just divine energy, but divine energy always comes as wild energy. It is our untamed energy, hence it looks wild. We have tamed only a small part of our energy and that feels perfectly cultured and civilised That’s where you live: at the topmost layer of your being. That is your personality. It is just a show-window thing: it is not your truth. Your depth is infinite. You are not confined by your personality – that is just your front door, the porch. But\npeople think that is their whole life. So when this inner energy starts rising up, when it starts making ways up and starts reaching to your conscious mind, one feels one is getting into something wild, something mad. It is not mad – it is your energy, unclaimed, until now unattended, waiting tor you, once this energy is absorbed you will have a greater being. You will feel as if you are expanding, and you will feel more alive, more vital, rejuvenated.\nSomething really beautiful is happening. Don’t stop it; allow it. Laugh and roll around on the floor and enjoy it. Even if sometimes you start reaching something similar to sexual orgasm, you have to allow it. It will bring something like a sexual orgasm all over the body, throbbing with joy, energy. Don’t become frightened about what is happening, because once this energy enters the sex centre – and it will – you will have a great orgasmic experience. That may become your most cherished experience ever. So you have to allow it; now I have told you, so you can consciously allow it. And after that there will be great silence you will fall into a very ecstatic silence. First the peak of ecstasy and then the depth of silence.\nMake it a point every night, for half an hour to one hour, to just roll around on the floor, to enjoy, laugh, cry, and feel your whole body throbbing, pulsating, streaming. Report to me after one month. By that time your energy will not look wild. It will look like your real energy and the one that you had always been thinking as your real energy will look just a pseudo face, a mask. The mask is slipping off and the real face is coming up. Even your physical face has changed. It looks more mature, more graceful, more at ease and settled. It is good.\nSo for one month go into it as deeply as you can. Allow it to go as deeply as you can. Sometimes you will feel that it is too much and you cannot bear it. Just hold the locket in your hands, remember me, and it will subside immediately.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1904","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">15</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1904 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

roll around on the floor, to enjoy, laugh, cry, and feel your whole body
throbbing, pulsating, streaming. Report to me after one month. By that
time your energy will not look wild. It will look like your real energy
and the one that you had always been thinking as your real energy will
look just a pseudo face, a mask. The mask is slipping off and the real
face is coming up. Even your physical face has changed. It looks more
mature, more graceful, more at ease and settled. It is good.</p><p><br></p><p>So for one month go into it as deeply as you can. Allow it to go as
deeply as you can. Sometimes you will feel that it is too much and you
cannot bear it. Just hold the locket in your hands, remember me, and it
will subside immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

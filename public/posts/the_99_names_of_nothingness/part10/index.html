Prem means love, Mujib is a sufi name for God. It means ‘one who hears the prayer, the hearer of prayers.’ No prayer is ever lost, and if it is, that simply means it has not been done; it never means anything else. Your heart was not in it, it was only lip service. There was a motivation in it, there was no purity. You wanted to manipulate God through it, and God cannot be manipulated. We can only surrender to Him. We can only allow Him to work upon us. We can only say to Him ‘Thy will be done.’\nThat should be the foundation of all prayer. A prayer should not be a demand – it should be a surrender. Then it is heard, then it is certainly heard. Never has a single prayer been futile. That is the meaning of the word ‘mujib’: God is ready to hear, we just have to learn how to say it. All that is needed is a heart, a loving heart, full of prayer.\nThe prayer should not be from the head. It should not be formal – christian, hindu, mohammedan, no. It should be yours, authentically yours. It should not be learnt from any priest. No priest should ever be allow to stand between you and your God. Your contact with God should be absolutely immediate, without a medium. It should be personal, it should be private it should be intimate. Then anything that comes from your heart is always fulfilled. God is not only a hearer of prayers – He is a fulfiller too. So become a loving prayer. That is the message in your name. Let your whole life become a prayer, praise to God, gratitude, a subtle song of joy.\nThis will be the name for your centre: Ya-Malik It means ‘Oh, Lord, Oh, King of Kings.’ It is a sufi name for God, it is also a beautiful mantra. The chanting of it can create beautiful spaces within you, just chanting ‘Ya-Malik, Ya-Malik, Ya-Malik...’ It has a sound value. Those vibrations, those sounds, penetrate to the very core of your being, they stir you to your very depths.\nThere are very few real mantras in the world; this is one of them. A real mantra is that mantra which has a sound value. It is not the meaning of the word that is significant, but just the sound, just the\nmusic of the sound, the melody of the sound, the science of the sound, the vibration. And vibrations can change people.\nCertain music can create great sexuality in you. Certain other music can create great serenity in you. Sounds go and hit your particular centres. Modern music hits only the sex centre. It almost creates a sexual delirium, a sexual hysteria; it is hysterical. Classical music goes higher. There are people like Beethoven who reach to the highest peak. Just listening to Beethoven is enough to create a meditative space inside and outside. The eastern music goes very deep. It is absolutely non-sexual, it never stirs the lower instincts. It gives you wings.\nThe sound value of ‘Ya-Malik’ is immense. So use it for chanting too.\n[A sannyasin, arriving, says: I feel an empty space right in front of me. It’s as if my old relationship with you is totally gone... it’s, it’s just empty... it’s not even as though it’s devotional.]\nVery good!... No, no, no need to be worried. This is higher than devotion. And you are not basically a devotional person mm ? so that is not needed at all. Devotion will never go very deep with you. It can only be the beginning In the end it will be just emptiness, not devotion. You are a natural Buddhist.\nA natural Buddhist, mm? – a non-devotional type.…\nBut two groups you must do any time, two buddhist groups you have to do: Zazen and Vipassana – whenever you feel like doing them, not just now. These two groups you have to do. They will help this emptiness. They will make you aware of it and they will make you capable of enjoying it. They will make you feel that it is not just empty – it is full of something unknown. It looks empty because all that is there is unfamiliar to you.\nIt is like a child who only knows his toys: he comes into the room and sees that the room is empty because his toys are not there. There are many things in the room but they don’t make any sense to him. They are irrelevant to the child. He looks for his toys and they are not there; he comes running out and he says that the room is empty.\nThat’s what is happening: all that you have known about your mind is not there. Those were toys. Now something of the no-mind is evolving, emerging. It is an emergent no-mind. And you will need to be made more acquainted with it from different angles. More clarity is needed, more friendship with this emptiness is needed, and that will only be possible if you do these two groups – Zazen and Vipassana. So whenever you feel to do them, do...\n[A sannyasin had previously written to Osho, and reminds him: I’m full of fear and anger and jealousy. I’m in a state of shock.]\nThat shock can be used for great growth!\nShocks can always be used for quantum leaps. Nobody ever grows without shocks. We have really so many shock-absorbers around ourselves – that is our armour – and those shock-absorbers can be broken only by great shocks. They absorb ordinary shocks, ordinary shocks cannot destroy\nthem. Extraordinary shocks are needed so that you are shaken to the very roots. So never miss the opportunity which a shock brings. Use that opportunity to grow. Take the challenge.\nAnd you have been doing well, I am happy. You have been doing well. Anybody would be in trouble in such a situation: your woman making love to somebody else – in front of you.\nAnybody would go berserk, would kill or be killed. But this is a shock that can be used. You will always be grateful to the woman and to the man, because this is how one drops clingings, possessiveness, jealousies.\nUnless a real situation arises, people only philosophise. And it is very beautiful to philosophise that one should not possess, that one should not be jealous. But when the real question arises, when you see something happening which hurts and hurts like hell, one forgets all philosophising.\nOne knows that now something has to be done. In fact, without even thinking, one reacts. And something has already happened, something has been already done; then one becomes aware. But then it is too late.\nYou have been doing well – I am happy with you Let this situation be a meditation. Nobody belongs to anybody. Neither does your woman belong to you nor do you belong to her. Nobody is anybody else’s master. Everybody is independent, unique. Be respectful. If she chooses this way, then it is perfectly okay; this is her choice. You have to respect her freedom and in respecting her freedom, you will grow free. Always remember: if you make somebody a slave to you, you Will become a slave to that person. It works both ways it is a double-edged sword: if you make the other free, in that very act you are making yourself free also.\nAnd these are all childish things, they don’t matter. This life is really nothing but a dream. Whether you see your woman making love to somebody in a dream or in reality is not in fact in any way different. You are in both cases just the observer. Remain the observer and don’t get involved in it. Remain a witness and great will be the benefit.\nJust raise your hands and close your eyes. If something starts happening, allow it; I would like to see the energy, how it is moving.\n[Osho checks his energy.]\nYou will be able to go beyond it; don’t be worried. Take things lightly, non-seriously I can see that you will be able to transcend it And that transcendence will bring you such beautitude you have never known before. It will be a .dropping of a layer of the mind. It will bring a new purity and innocence. It will be a breakthrough. Welcome the shock and go into it.\n[The sannyasin asks: Is there anything I can do?]\nNo, nothing has to be done – you have just to be a watcher, just witness it. [The sannyasin answers: It’s just that energy wants to do something.]\nMm mm, so you can just dance and sing. You can dance and sing – that is allowed!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1498","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_99_names_of_nothingness/>The 99 Names of Nothingness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1498 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_99_Names_of_Nothingness/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

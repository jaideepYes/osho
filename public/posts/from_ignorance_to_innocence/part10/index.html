HE CREATED PEOPLE LIKE JESUS CHRIST, HAZRAT MOHAMMED, KRISHNA AND BUDDHA.\nIT is not a question. It is a statement, an answer, but I have not asked the question. The person seems even to know whom God created in His own image and whom God did not create in His own image. The person seems to be an eyewitness. What was he doing there? Did God create him in His own image? Then what is he doing here? But I can enjoy even answering an answer.\nHe says God did not create people like Adolf Hitler in His own image. What is wrong in Adolf Hitler? The followers of Adolf Hitler believe that he was the reincarnation of the great Jewish prophet, Elijah. It is as true as the Christian’s belief that Jesus is the only begotten son of God, and the Mohammedan’s belief that Mohammed is the only messenger of God. Nobody else believes it, but that is not the point. Christians believe, the followers of Adolf Hitler also believe.\nAnd Adolf Hitler was a very religious man. Let me give you a little glimpse of Adolf Hitler’s life. He lived like a monk, in an underground cell. He was not interested in so-called worldly things that everybody is interested in. He was a vegetarian, he never ate any non-vegetarian food in his whole life. He remained unmarried almost his whole life – except for three hours, the last three hours. That is almost a whole life; what do three hours count? And what is possible in three hours of marriage?\nThe marriage was arranged after he decided to commit suicide, because he had been harassed by this woman continually: “Why don’t you get married to me?” and he was refusing. He lived like a monk, absolutely alone in his cell, and he was worried that once he got married then it would be difficult to live alone, this woman would force her way into his room. So he went on postponing.\nWhen he decided finally, Berlin was falling and the bombs were falling on the street outside the house; he could hear the bombs exploding from his cell. He immediately asked for a priest to be called so that the marriage could be arranged. Marriage for what? – to commit suicide together.\nPerhaps most people do the same, not knowingly. Perhaps their three hours are very long; and the longer they are, the more tedious.\nA priest was somehow brought in. He quickly did the marriage ceremony, and after the ceremony was over they drank poison and killed themselves. His order was that petrol should be poured over them and they should be burned completely; not even a trace should be found – and that’s how it was done.\nAdolf Hitler used to wake up every morning before sunrise. All monks are not so religious. I know monks are supposed to get up before sunrise – but human beings are human beings. Adolf Hitler was made of a different mettle. Even in winter he would get up before sunrise, and the whole year round he would take a cold shower after getting up – the first thing, a cold shower. A very disciplined monk... he would go to sleep exactly at nine at night. He was not interested in anything that you can call bad. He neither played cards nor smoked cigarettes. His food was very simple, very frugal and he never drank wine – no alcoholic beverages.\nWhen Germany took over France, all his generals wanted him to come to the most beautiful city in the world, but he was not interested. Beauty was not a concern in his mind at all; but because everybody was asking him, and they had done a great job of conquering France, he went there. But he stayed only twenty-four hours in his hotel room and did not go to see Paris.\nYou say God did not create Adolf Hitler in His own image. Why? Because he killed so many people? But every day God is killing millions of people – who else is killing them? Adolf Hitler was simply sharing a little bit of God’s job. People have to be killed, everybody has to die; so what is wrong in it if Adolf Hitler shares a little work, takes a little burden off God?\nAnd he did perfectly well, far better than God himself Sometimes it happens, the carbon copy comes out clearer than the original. He invented gas chambers, the most non-violent method of killing man; but you cannot call it killing – killing is too cruel. In a gas chamber the person never comes to know when he is and when he is not. It is so quick: just a switch put on and there is only smoke – you can call it holy smoke! He did his job perfectly.\nIn fact Hitler had this belief, this fanatic idea that he had been sent by God to destroy all that was not right, all that was hindering the growth of the superman on the earth. He was doing everything in good faith.\nYou cannot suspect his faith, his intention, because if he had been a little bit suspicious it would have been impossible to do what he did, killing millions of people. It needs tremendous faith, fanatic,\nblind faith that what you are doing is the right thing. There was no suspicion in his mind, no doubt at all that he was doing God’s work – cleaning the world of all that was not in tune with the evolution of the superman.\nYou say God did not create Adolf Hitler in His own image. That raises a question: Then who created Adolf Hitler? Are there a few other gods also? That means there is a choice; you can shop and choose in whose shape you want to be created. You can just go into Devateerth Mall and choose your own god: “I want to be created in this god’s image.”\nThis is an old strategy of the so-called pseudo-religious people – that whatsoever is good belongs to God, and whatsoever is bad belongs to the devil.\nThen who created the devil?\nGod has to take responsibility at some point or other. I cannot leave Him out of it. If He says that Adolf Hitler is being created by His enemy, the devil, okay, but who created the devil? God cannot shirk the responsibility, shrug it from His shoulders. He must have created the devil, otherwise from where does the devil come in? And if the devil can come from somewhere else, then anybody can come from somewhere else. So what is the need for god to create? – creation is being done somewhere else too. God should be told, “You are not a monopolist, there are other potters – and perhaps there may be better potters, because the world that you have created does not seem to be a perfect world. And you seem to be absolutely impotent: if the devil goes on smuggling his people into your world, what are you doing there? At least you can stop this smuggling business. And it is going on, on a tremendously vast scale. In fact your people seem to be very few, can be counted on one’s fingers – the devil’s people seem to be in millions.”\nIt is strange that God goes on sitting on His throne, gossiping with the Holy Ghost, playing with His only begotten son, Jesus; and the devil goes on running the whole world – goes on creating Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Mao Tse-tung.… The whole of history seems to be ninety-nine point nine percent a creation of the devil.\nThen why go on giving credit to God as the creator? He may be an amateur potter – once in a while He makes a pot – but the devil seems to be the professional. Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte and Ivan the Terrible – just go down through history – are all these people not created by God? They are, but you are afraid to accept the fact because then your God becomes almost a devil.\nYou say God created men like Jesus Christ, Hazrat Mohammed, Krishna and Gautam Buddha. Let us look at these people whom you think God created. Jesus is a Jew – born a Jew, lived a Jew, died a Jew. He had never heard the word “Christian”, and I don’t think that he had any idea of creating a religion called Christianity. There is no indication anywhere even to create a suspicion that he had it in mind to create a new religion, no. His whole life he was trying to do only one thing – to be accepted by the Jews as their messiah.\nNow, the God of the Jews is a Jew, Jesus is a Jew, the high priest of the Jews is a Jew. The rabbis, who are in the highest posts in the great temple of the Jews, are all religious people, very scholarly and very knowledgeable. It is difficult to find more scholarly people than rabbis: their whole life is\ndevoted to study, to scholarship. And the high priest must have been a great rabbi, that is why he had been chosen.\nThey decide to crucify Jesus. A Jewish God creates Jesus in His own image, but Jewish rabbis, their high priest, and the Jewish community do not recognize that man at all, that he is an image of God. They look upon him as a mischief-monger, as a cheat, a deceiver.\nNow, if God sends His own son, can’t He send a small message to the high priest: “Please take care of my son, my only begotten son,” and they are all Jews so they all understand the same language. There would not have been any difficulty – but He remains silent. Jesus is crucified and God is silent; His image is destroyed and He remains absolutely indifferent.\nIn fact, Jesus is not such a disciplined man as Adolf Hitler. Jesus drinks wine and even turns water into wine, which should be a crime. You try turning anything into LSD! Do that miracle and you will be in jail. Turn ordinary grass into real grass and you will find what it means to do a miracle!\nNow, this man was turning water into wine, and he was drinking wine without any feelings of guilt. No Hindu, no Mohammedan, no Jaina, no Buddhist will accept this man as an image of God. An image of God drinking alcoholic beverages! The image of God should be the pinnacle of consciousness, and drinking anything alcoholic is just the opposite of being conscious; it is drowning yourself in unconsciousness. It is one of the most anti-religious acts possible.\nThis man Jesus, although he teaches about meekness and humbleness, is very arrogant himself Buddha could not have accepted him as an image of God. His proclamation, “I am the only son of God,” is the greatest egoistic proclamation ever made. Adolf Hitler’s claim is not that great: Elijah... who knows this Elijah? He must have looked into the Old Testament and found a name somehow appealing to him for some reason, because with Adolf Hitler you could never be sure what reason.… Perhaps he was counting the numbers which numerology gives to each letter of the alphabet, and found that Elijah was a good numerological name – because these were the things in which Adolf Hitler believed – numerology, astrology, palmistry.\nYou will be surprised that even his attacks on countries were not decided by generals but by astrologers. In fact, this was the reason for his continual victory in the first four years – it was not that astrology is right but that his enemies could not figure out where he was going to attack. If he had been listening to his generals, then of course every other country would have been able to figure out his plans, because all the generals think in a certain way. There is a military science based on simple arithmetic: you don’t attack the enemy where he is strongest; obviously you attack him where he is weakest.\nBut Adolf Hitler would attack where the enemy was strongest. And the enemy would be thinking: “Here we are strongest; Adolf Hitler is not going to attack here,” so they would move their armies to their weakest point. But he was not going to attack there, because he depended on astrology: the stars were in favor at another point, so from that point he would attack.\nNow, if both sides were deciding through the generals, both sides would have been absolutely clear where the attack was going to happen, because both were functioning according to the same logic – but here there was no question of logic. And Adolf Hitler’s word was law. There was no “reason\nwhy” – that could not be asked of Adolf Hitler. You could not ask, “Why have you decided on this procedure...?”\nNobody was allowed to ask; even the closest people were not close enough. Not a single man was close enough to put his hand on Adolf Hitler’s shoulder. Nobody was a friend; Adolf Hitler never allowed any friendship. He was far above that... the reincarnation of the prophet Elijah, and you ordinary human beings crawling on the earth – and you ask him why?\nSo for four years he was continually winning, until Winston Churchill himself had to come down to the same rules, against his will. This was stupid, but what to do? – if you are fighting with an idiot, you have to be an idiot, otherwise you are going to be the loser. He had to call astrologers from India, because that is where you can find the best astrologers. And the Indian astrologers felt tremendously great, that finally even Winston Churchill had understood that, “Astrology is a science and we are far more advanced than you are.\nAnd certainly Winston Churchill started winning with the entry of astrology, because now he was also going crazy. He was a great general but now he was doing things against himself, against his whole reason and experience – but what to do? “That other fellow will be listening to the astrologers – you have to listen to astrologers. And it is a question of victory, so it is not the time to argue about astrology; the time for that argument we can find later on. First finish this man and this mad situation.”\nWhen Winston Churchill started listening to the astrologers, he started winning because he also began attacking in a crazy way, with no logic. And certainly he had stranger astrologers than Adolf Hitler, because Adolf Hitler’s astrologers were western: you could find in London the same kind of astrologers who could tell you what those German astrologers would be suggesting to Adolf Hitler. But these Indian astrologers had a totally different astrology.\nAdolf Hitler had no way to find out what these astrologers were suggesting, because both were different in their workings. Even in palmistry... in western palmistry some line shows something; in Indian palmistry the same line shows something else – because there is nothing written on the line. It depends on you, what you want to make out of it.\nJesus died on the cross – that does not seem to be the right place for the son of God. And if you ask Jainas, Buddhists and Hindus, you will find an answer in what they say. You will be surprised also with their answer, but their answer seems to be more rational. They say, “He must have committed some great sin in his past life and this is the outcome of that great sin – the simple law of karma – otherwise why should he be crucified?\n“No Hindu avatara is crucified, no Jaina tirthankara is crucified, no Buddha is crucified – that is impossible! In fact when Mahavira, the Jaina tirthankara, walks on the road” – and in those days there were no tar roads or cement roads, just muddy tracks – and if there is a thorn on the road it will immediately turn its pointed part downwards so that Mahavira’s feet remain unhurt and unharmed.\nBecause that man has finished with all his karmas, even a thorn cannot hurt him – what to say of a cross! Even a thorn has to consider that,‘a man is coming here who is finished with all his karmas. You cannot bother him; you had better put yourself in such a position that you don’t hurt him.”’ Now, these people – how can they accept Christ as the son of God, a messiah?\nIn Buddhist scriptures there are so many incidents described. A mad elephant was released towards Buddha to kill him. The mad elephant had killed many people; whoever came in his way, he finished them. He was kept in chains by the king, just for the simple purpose of killing criminals.\nThe whole royal family, their advisors and their ministers, would sit on the balconies of the palace and enjoy the game. Down on the ground the criminal would be standing; the elephant would be brought in and his chains taken away. He would rush immediately towards the man who would run and scream; and all those people would enjoy it, just as you enjoy a bullfight or Mohammed Ali’s boxing. All these are of the same type, there is not much difference: what you are enjoying is violence. But the elephant was bound to kill him – where could he escape?\nThis elephant was sent to kill Buddha, but even the mad elephant recognized, when he saw Buddha, that this man was finished with all his karmas; you could not hurt him – rather this was an opportunity to touch his feet and to earn some good karma for your future life. So he touched Buddha’s feet and sat down there. The king could not believe his eyes. They had all followed what had happened, so they asked Buddha, “Only you can say what happened.”\nHe said, “Nothing special. The elephant is wiser than you. He can see that all my karmas are finished and I have no more to suffer, my accounts are closed, the balance sheet is complete – whatever I have done, I have suffered for it, and I am completely clean. Seeing this, the elephant thought,‘Why miss this opportunity? Where will I find such a man?’ So he is touching my feet to be blessed. In fact he is already blessed; he has already gained enough virtue – he will be born in his future life as a great buddha. He will become enlightened himself, because if he can recognize a Buddha even in madness, then he is not identified with his madness. He is still aware that he is different.”\nNow, do you think Buddhists will accept Jesus, the image of God, being crucified? Even an elephant can see when a Buddha is there; yet those thousands of Jews were there and nobody could see, not a single person, that this man was the image of God and you should not destroy him. It is just your conditioning... otherwise no other religion is going to accept Jesus in any way.\nHe is mixing with people – Mahavira will not allow his monks to mix, what to say of Mahavira himself Jesus is mixing with gamblers, prostitutes, thieves – the lowest strata of society. Mahavira will not allow it, Buddha will not allow it. And why is he mixing with those people? – because nobody else is ready to mix with him. The high classes, the richer classes, the educated and cultured and sophisticated people were not ready even to mix with this carpenter’s son-uneducated, a village idiot – who was declaring himself son of God.\nOnly one time had a professor come to him, and that too, in the middle of the night. He was a rabbi and a known professor, Nicodemus. He had come in the night when there was nobody around and all the apostles had fallen asleep. Jesus was doing his last prayer before he went to sleep. In the dark came this very respected, rich rabbi, a professor in the university, and he introduced himself Jesus said, “Why don’t you come in the day? It is the middle of the night; I was just going to sleep. I have just finished my last prayer.”\nNicodemus said, “In the day I cannot come because people will see that I associate with a man like you. I have heard about you so much that curiosity has brought me here, but in the day I cannot\nadmit the fact that I came to see you.” The higher class people were not mixing – what to say of mixing – they were not even ready to talk to this man.\nThis is the son of God, created in His own image – and nobody in the whole of Judea could recognize him except those few fools who had no religious education, no understanding. They were fishers, woodcutters, farmers – and they enjoyed the idea of being associated with the only son of God because that gave them the hope that, “When we reach the kingdom of God we will be with the son, close to God. Then all these rich people, these kings, these viceroys and these rabbis will see who we are. Right now we are only fishermen, woodcutters, farmers” So that was their hope. That’s\nwhy it was so cheap to enter the kingdom of God with Jesus. This opportunity was not to be missed. But he could find only those twelve people in the whole of Judea.\nNo great religion in the East will accept him, because a man is known by his company, and his company was certainly not good. And that company became his apostles, that company created Christianity; so if Christianity is a third-rate religion there is no wonder about it – it has come from a very thirdrate source. It hasn’t the profundity of Jainism or Buddhism or Hinduism: there is no comparison.\nBut you are asking about Hazrat Mohammed. Now what do you see in Hazrat Mohammed that you think he can be proclaimed as the image of God? For his whole life he was a killer. His hand was always on his sword, even in his sleep: his whole life was a continual war. Of course on his sword he had written, “Peace is my mission.” A strange peace, that you have to write on your sword, “Peace is my mission.”\nAnd with the sword Mohammed wanted to bring peace into the world. Either you accepted that he was the messenger of God or you were finished – that was the peace. In both ways there would be peace: either you became Mohammedan and there was peace, or you were no more and there was peace. Certainly that message on his sword was really meaningful. You could choose: two kinds of peace he allowed you.\nMohammedanism had converted millions just on the fear of death: man’s lust for life is such that he will be ready to do anything. And what was he asking? It is nothing to make much of a fuss about. His religion is simple, almost a simpleton’s religion: repeat the name of Allah five times and for one month every year – the month of Ramadan – keep a fast in the day. In the night you can eat; in the night there is a feast, so the whole day you fast and in the night you feast.\nThis is a strange kind of fasting – in India it is just the opposite. In the night you cannot eat at all – fasting, not fasting, that is not the question; but while you are fasting then it is absolutely impossible to eat in the night. The sun has gone down, life has gone to sleep – and this is not the time for eating.\nAnd it seems to be rational and reasonable that when the sun is there digestion is easier. You will be working, you will be perspiring, you will be doing something; digestion is easier. When in the night the sun has gone down and you are going to sleep, if you eat, then digestion is not going to be good. It is a simple fact.\nBut why did Mohammed choose the other way? The reason was that the whole day they were fighting. In the night the fight had to stop because in darkness, in the desert you could not fight, so\nin the night you could eat and enjoy. In the day, the month of Ramadan is a month of fasting and fighting.\nAnd when you are fighting it is good to fast so you are not bothered by food. Otherwise you need a foodbreak, a teabreak, a coffeebreak, and in war you cannot make all these breaks; in war you have to be totally in it, no break. In the desert, when the sun sets, war ends; you cannot fight in the night. Then you are free; then with ease, with comfort you can eat, dance and enjoy yourself late into the night and then go to sleep – and be ready again in the morning with the sword to bring peace into the world.\nMohammed killed an uncountable number of people, and his followers have been killing people for these fifteen hundred years continually. I don’t think there is anybody – Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Jew or Jaina – who can kill as easily as a Mohammedan. A Jaina of course cannot even kill an ant – that is enough to go to hell. Killing a man is unheard of.\nIn the whole of history not a single Jaina has been sentenced to death because he murdered; it is not possible. He can be murdered, but he cannot murder. Even if you give him a sword, it will fall from his hand immediately; he cannot hold it – he may not even know how to hold it. Except for the small knife that he uses in the kitchen, he knows nothing about any weapon. He will find it easier to be killed than to kill... because if you are killed you are not going to fall into hell, and if you are killed without any resistance, then heaven is yours: just the opposite of the Mohammedan.\nIf you kill somebody in a war of religion, a jihad, what Christians call a crusade... and all wars are jihads. They are for religion: they are to convert the other person. And Mohammedanism has used the lowest kind of methodology to pervert – yes, I would like to say pervert – a man into Mohammedanism. I would not like to use the word convert.…\nWhat kind of conversion is this? You have not even had a little conversation before it, you don’t give any opportunity to the man. You simply say, “Either you believe in one God; one prophet, that is Mohammed; and one holy book, that is the Koran.These three things you have to believe, that’s\nall, then you are a Mohammedan – otherwise, accept death.”\nMohammed says the more people you bring to Mohammedanism, the more virtue you are attaining. And if you have to kill many people, don’t be afraid: that too will be counted as virtue, because you have saved those people from remaining heretics all their life. The man may have lived forty years more, so you have saved him from forty years of a heretic’s life. That much compassion you have shown to that man! Strange logic! But all these pseudo-religions are full of strange logic.\nHazrat Mohammed had nine wives – God has not even one! And God created Mohammed in His own image? What kind of image? He should have remained celibate, but he married nine women\nand allowed all Mohammedans to marry four women. The reason was that Mohammed wanted more and more soldiers. From where to get soldiers? One woman can get married to four men but then too in one year she will give birth to only one child, so that is absolutely uneconomical. But if four women are married to one man then certainly they can give birth to four children in one year. He wanted more and more Mohammedans, more and more children, more and more soldiers – and this was a way to find them. But where are you going to find so many women?\nSo for that there is also a good strategy: you can steal anybody’s woman and you can convert the woman to Mohammedanism. Now in India, a woman who has been converted by the Mohammedans – if even for one night she has remained in a Mohammedan house – will not be accepted back into a Jaina family or in a brahmin family or in a Buddhist family. That is impossible because Mohammedans are thought to be the worst people in the world – the woman has remained the whole night with those people and they have even converted her – and their method of conversion is something which creates nausea in Jainas, Buddhists, brahmins, everybody in India.\nThe conversion method is that you have to eat with Mohammedans from one plate. So four, five, six... as many Mohammedans as are available will all sit around a table – their brotherhood is guaranteed now. The new person who is being converted will also eat from the same plate with them and then they will all drink from the same cup; the new person has also to drink from the same cup. Now, to any other Indian religion this is not acceptable at all. I know, because I had Mohammedan friends, and it was such a difficulty.\nOne of my friends in the university who was almost not a Mohammedan, he was just born a Mohammedan – because a fanatic Mohammedan cannot be friendly with me at all.Listening\nto me, still he remained my friend; that was enough proof that he had an open mind. Professor Farid was his name, and many times he would come with me to my village which was eighty miles from the university. Once in a while I would drive to the village just to see my father because he was so much attached to me that if I did not come for eight or ten days, then he would come to see me; he would not be satisfied that everything was okay without seeing me. He was always afraid that something was going to be wrong.\nSo rather than troubling him I used to drive there, and Farid many times came with me. I had to explain to him, “Listen, you are going to a Jaina family, so don’t feel offended – even I am not allowed in the kitchen, so what about you! They suspect me of eating with Mohammedans and Christians”\nYou will be surprised that the Hindu word for Christian is Kristan. In the beginning Kristan was used for the Christian, but by and by it became associated with something wrong, something bad. So if you are doing something wrong, they will say, “Don’t behave like a Kristan.” First I was puzzled that Kristan is the Hindi for Christian, but then I understood why: because to them, a Christian or a Mohammedan belong to the anti-religious – their religions are not worth anything.\nSo I told Farid, “We will be sitting outside when eating, and you will be given a special plate that is kept separate, because they know that once in a while I bring a Christian or a Mohammedan home. So they keep a whole set separate and nobody in the family will touch that set.” I had to bring it in and put it before my friend; then I had to clean it because nobody else was going to clean it. I said, “Don’t feel offended in any way; this is just how things are. And don’t disturb these people, because even this much is too much for them – that just outside their kitchen a Mohammedan is sitting; this is too much.”\nSo it was very easy in India to get hold of anybody’s woman and just keep her one or two days in your house; then she could not go back. Even if she wanted to, even if you were ready to send her back, she could not go back; she had to get married to you – there was no other way. They converted millions of women in this way; and with the women came the increase in population. But this is ugly.\nIf you convince somebody about your truth and he wants to come and belong to your fold, it seems human. But to threaten him, “You will be killed if you don’t become a Mohammedan,” and out of that threat he decides to live as a Mohammedan rather than to die as a Hindu – this is not at all religious. But this is what Mohammed brought into the world – and he was the only messenger. He is so uneducated, so ignorant that what he says does not look like philosophy, not like great treatises like the Upanishads, or the Tao Te Ching, or the Dhammapada – nothing like it. Just such things he is saying in the Koran, that a Mohammedan can marry four women, it is his religious right. And this persists.…\nIn India now the constitution gives the right to have only one woman, but still Mohammedans go on marrying four women; and you cannot interfere, because if you interfere, immediately riots break out all over India. Thousands will be killed immediately and nothing will be changed. Simply thousands will be killed, thousands of houses will be burned, temples will be burned – so it is better to tolerate it. The constitution is there, the law is there, but who cares?\nThe Mohammedan goes on doing this because it is his religious principle, and you should not interfere in his religion. The government is secular, so it cannot interfere. It is strange, some religion can make cannibalism its principle, then you can start eating human beings and the government cannot do anything, because it is your religion and they should not interfere in religion.\nMohammed is not much different from Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Genghis Khan or Adolf Hitler. No, not different at all, he was just born in a different age so he speaks in a different language, which is more of a religious jargon; otherwise he is the same type of man – a criminal mind.\nYou ask me about Krishna. You must have thought that I would at least accept Krishna and Buddha as the images of God – no. There is no God in the first place so how can there be any image? And whoever you bring before me as an image, I am going to hammer hard on. It is a fight with the fictitious God; it is not a fight with Jesus, Mohammed, Krishna or Buddha. If that fictitious God is finished with, much of the glory of these people will be demolished.\nIf there is no God, then “I am the only begotten son” cannot be said. Then, “I bring the message of God, and only my message is true because it comes from God” cannot be said. So I am trying to destroy the fiction of God. Of course I will have to beat the images too, because just by being God’s image they go on giving life to a fiction.\nKrishna is one of the most cunning politicians the world has ever known; and perhaps in the future also it will not be possible to have such a cunning politician. He is not a man of his word at all: that’s why I call him a politician. He will say one thing and will do exactly the opposite. He will make you a promise and he will break the promise any moment he finds that it is in his favor to do so. You cannot rely on him at all. His whole life is full of using people’s trust, taking advantage, deceiving... but the Hindus go on saying, “This is God’s play.”\nYou can always find good words for anything. The young girls of the town would be taking a bath in the river and he would collect all their clothes and sit in a nearby tree. Now, they would be asking for their clothes, standing naked in the waterAnybody else doing such a thing would be immediately\ntaken to the police station. But in many Hindu families you will find this picture hanging – of course not in those houses where I have stayed.…\nOnce, when I stayed with a Hindu family who had the picture in their home, I said, “You should be ashamed – keeping this picture here, just in your sitting room. You think you are displaying some great religiousness – this is religiousness? If I did the same with your wife and with your daughter, then...?”\nThe man said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “Yes, if I actually do this, what Krishna was doing, that would be God’s play. Why should he be an exception?” Sixteen thousand wives were stolen by Krishna, forcibly taken away from people, from their husbands and from their children. He must have created a great concentration camp for these wives. And I don’t think that he would have recognized who was his wife and who wasn’t. And I don’t think that this is in any way an exaggeration.\nIn India it used to happen: kings used to have hundreds of wives. Even today, the Nizam of Hyderabad, who died just a few years ago, left five hundred wives behind him – five hundred widows... one man. So sixteen thousand doesn’t seem too big a number – only thirty-two times more than the Nizam of Hyderabad. And Krishna is certainly thirty-two times more wealthy than the Nizam of Hyderabad.\nThe person’s richness was counted by how many wives he had. A poor man could not afford even one wife; for a poor man to have one wife, only one wife, was difficult – he could not manage even two meals a day for himself So the way, in ancient India, to show how wealthy you were, was to have many wives – and Krishna defeated everybody. Just to defeat everybody, sixteen thousand wives and sixteen thousand families were destroyed. Their children may have become orphans or beggars – what happened nobody knows – but this man is thought to be the image of God!\nYou can’t see his cruelty? And it is not for love’s sake: he does not even know these women. How can you know sixteen thousand women? What love can you give to sixteen thousand women? What relatedness is possible with these women? They are just imprisoned to show your greatness.\nThe same egoistic attitude, perhaps even strongerKrishna says to his disciple, Arjuna: “Surrender\nat my feet. Leaving aside everything – your doubts, your thinking – leave aside everything, just surrender at my feet. I am your salvation, I am your refuge.”\nNow, anybody saying that seems to be ugly. If it were true, then even Arjuna would recognize it himself You need not declare it, you need not persistently say to him, “Surrender at my feet.” Certainly he is not surrendering, hence the insistence. He is continually arguing, bringing doubts, questions; and he is not convinced – I don’t think he was ever convinced.\nI have tried hard to look into the whole conversation between Arjuna and Krishna – that is the Shrimad Bhagavadgita, the whole conversation. The way Arjuna is arguing is perfectly right and the doubts he is raising are perfectly valid; but what Krishna is saying – his answers are not justified. They don’t dispel the doubts and they don’t dispel Arjuna’s confusion; hence, tired of arguing with Arjuna, Krishna says, “Leave everything aside and simply surrender at my feet, because I am the perfect incarnation of God.”\nBut if you have to say it, then I say, you are not! If the other recognizes it even though you deny it, then perhaps there is something to it. If you are denying it, but the other goes on seeing something\nwhich is more than can be understood by the mind, which is more than can be comprehended by intellect.If the other goes on feeling it, the presence of it, the smell of it – and against your denial\nhe says, “You can go on denying it, I don’t care; I listen to my heart, and my heart is saying something to me” – that is something totally different. But that does not happen in the whole conversation in the Gita.\nKrishna simply forces him; and seeing the situation and the awkwardness of the situation, because they are standing on the battlefield.Krishna is functioning as his charioteer and both armies are\nfacing each other, just about to begin the war for which they have been preparing for years and which is going to be decisive for the whole of India. And it proved to be decisive: it destroyed the very backbone of the country.\nThree men I find responsible for India’s downfall. The first is Krishna, because he destroyed India’s zest, gusto for fighting. He drove India into a kind of third world war, in which almost the whole country was devastated and destroyed. Everybody – whosoever was alive – became so shaken and afraid of war that they were ready to do anything rather than go to war.\nAnd then came Buddha and Mahavira who started talking about non-violence. That appealed very much to people who were so tired of war. And they had seen such a great war that they never wanted to have anything to do with it again. It would be better to be slaves rather than to have such a war and such destruction.\nMahabharata is the name of the war, the great Indian war; after that there have been only battles – nothing like the great Indian war. Its magnitude was almost universal: whatsoever was known of the world at that time, every part of that world joined in the war, either from this side or from that side. Both sides were cousin-brothers and the problem was: who should inherit the kingdom?\nOn one side were one hundred kauravas, one hundred brothers. Now you can see, the father was blind yet he must have had thousands of wives – even a blind fellow managed to produce one hundred sons – and his brother had five sons, the pandavas. The conflict was: who is going to inherit the kingdom? They could not negotiate in any way, so that was the only way to decide: go to war. And because it was one family, all the relatives were divided – somebody was fighting from that side, somebody was fighting from this side; a brother from that side, another brother from this side – and there were all their friends from all over the world.\nYou will be surprised to know that Arjuna had one wife from Mexico too – Mexican kings had come with their armies to fight on Arjuna’s side. The Sanskrit name for Mexico is makshika; Mexico is a distortion of Makshika. Now much historical evidence has been collected and it is certain that Makshika is Mexico. In Mexico, Hindu temples have been found, Hindu gods and goddesses and their statues have been found. And the latest discovery is that there was a time when the water between Asia and America, the ocean water, was so shallow that you could simply walk from America to Asia. You could simply walk over the ocean; it was one foot deep at the most.\nSo the whole known world at that time had gathered for this decisive battle and all were ready for the signal to be given. But they were waiting because Krishna was still persuading Arjuna. Arjuna wanted to leave; he said, “I want to renounce war because I don’t see any point in it. All these people are my people: on this side are my people, on that side are my people. I see my friends on that side\nthat I will have to kill and I see my friends on this side. These people, these hundred Kauravas are my brothers, and I have to kill these people just for the kingdom? Millions of people will be killed in the war – and even if we win, who will there be to rejoice in the victory?”\nAnd he was absolutely right. “Who will there be to rejoice in the victory over the corpses of millions of relatives and friends? These are the people for whom we would have fought, for whom we would have won the victory so that they could rejoice with us, celebrate with us – but all these people will be dead. There is no certainty we will win, there is no certainty that the other party will win, because both are equally balanced. But one thing is certain: whosoever wins, almost everybody will be dead.” And that’s what happened.\nFinally Krishna argued: “You are a coward, you are an impotent man escaping from the warfield; you are a warrior, and the religion of the warrior is to fight. Are you afraid of killing, of murdering? – but these people are going to die anyway.” Just see the argument, what he is saying: “These people are going to die anyway, anyday. Nobody is immortal, so if you murder these people you are not doing anything that you have to be worried about. Perhaps you have taken a few years off this man’s life, but in that too you are wrong to think that you are doing: the doer is God, and whatsoever happens, happens through His will – we are only His instruments.”\nThat’s what I was telling you – that these religions have been reducing humanity to puppets. Krishna’s whole Gita can be condensed in a single sentence: “Man is a puppet; the puppeteer is God.” So whatever the puppeteer wants, you do: if He makes you dance, you dance, if He makes you jog, you jog; whatsoever He makes you do, you leave everything to God. You simply act and don’t think of the consequences and the results. That’s the whole message of the Gita, on which the whole of Hinduism stands: you go on surrendering everything to God, and don’t bother about the result – the result is in His hands.\nNow this is a very tricky argument. If I had been in Arjuna’s place I would have slapped Krishna then and there, told him to get down from the chariot and said, “I am going – because this is the will of God. Who am I to think? Now my whole being is saying to renounce this war; I am going. This is my God’s voice. Who are you? And I am not going to think about the consequences, that people will think me a coward. Let them think it – that is their business.”\nIn fact the argument that Krishna is giving to Arjuna is so bogus that if Arjuna had had a little insight into argumentation he could have turned the whole thing round. Krishna is saying, “Only do, and don’t think of the result.”\nArjuna should have said, “Great! So I will only do this, and I will not bother about the result” – and he should have turned his chariot towards the jungle.\nBut he got befooled, perhaps by the situation or the pressure. He had collected all these people, he had invited all these people, and now at the last moment to escape“What will the world say?\nAnd Krishna is God’s incarnation – that’s what people say – and if he is saying,‘Fight and leave the consequences in God’s hands,’ then I should fight.” So he fought and they won. But whatsoever he was afraid of did happen. The whole country has never been again alive in the same way as it was before. It lost its backbone, it lost its manliness.\nI cannot say that Krishna is the image of God. He is far closer to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, or Mao Tse-tung than to God. This is what Adolf Hitler was doing, what poor Adolf Hitler was doing – why should he be condemned? He was doing God’s will and not bothering about the consequences. It was the same thing with Krishna: he forced Arjuna to do something that he wanted, argued for it – and destroyed the country for at least five thousand years. It is still not free of the shadow of the Mahabharata: that great war still falls like a shadow on India.\nAnd the last the questioner asks about is Gautam Buddha. He must have thought that at least I will agree about Gautam Buddha – but he is wrong. In the first place Gautam Buddha does not believe in God, that God exists, so he will not agree that he is an image of God. He himself would disagree with this statement, that he is an image of God. He does not believe in God. He himself cannot say he is an image of God, and he has never said that.\nThe very idea of “the image of God” is inapplicable to Gautam Buddha – Krishna is born as an incarnation of God, Jesus is born as the only son of God, Mohammed is born as the only messenger of God, but this is not the case with Buddha. He is born a human being, and he goes in search for truth. If he were made in the image of God he would have known the truth already, but he goes in search, a long search.\nBuddha takes immense pains in every possible way to find out the truth. He does everything he is told. He goes to all the teachers that were well-known in the country until each teacher says, “Now I cannot teach you any more because whatsoever I knew, I have taught you. You move on, go somewhere else; you know more than I know now.” But this knowledge was not satisfying. He did everything, and that was his basic mistake: all the teachers got fed up with him.\nTeachers never get fed up with a person who goes on committing mistakes. Then the teacher is always happy: “You committed this mistake, that’s why you are missing; you committed that mistake, that’s why you are missing.” But this man was so particular that he was overdoing what the teacher was saying. No teacher – and he was with dozens of teachers – could say to him that he had failed because he had not done something, he had missed something. No, every teacher understood that he had done everything – and nothing had happened.\nHe is standing there saying, “You said all these things are to be done; I think they have been done to completion. If not, tell me where the mistake is, and I am going to correct it. But nothing is happening. The teachers soon realized that they could not cheat and exploit this man – he was ready to go to any length.\nBut a point comes where the teacher becomes afraid because he himself does not know. He is just a scholar, a great scholar maybe; he can teach you all the methods but he himself has never done them. He knows no truth; he has not realized himself, so this man becomes a question mark to him, because he is doing exactly what is being told and yet nothing is happening.\nFinally the last teacher he was with told him, “Don’t waste your time with teachers. I am the greatest of all those teachers; many of them have been my students. Seeing in your eyes your sincerity, your authenticity, I would like to say to you that you have to go on your own. Nobody can take you there, nobody can lead you there; you have to go there on your own. So forget about teachers, forget about teachings and just move on your own. You have done enough of all these disciplines, yogas,\nmantras, tantras – all that is available.” And India is a great bazaar, buzzing with all kinds of things that you can do; it can drive you on for many lives. And those methods will not end; they are always there, and new ones too.\nBuddha understood it because he had wasted twelve years and he was nowhere. But really, he had achieved something without being aware of it: he was finished with following. And that is a great achievement. To become religious, that is one of the greatest achievements: to be finished with following.\nHe went alone. He himself had gathered, in those years, five followers. He told them also, “Forgive me, but all those teachers wasted my time and I don’t want to waste your time – you go on your own. Leave me alone and I will leave you alone. I am not your leader, and you are not my followers. From now onwards I am alone. I will risk everything, but if there is any truth, I will find it; if there is none, I will find that.”\nThis man has never claimed that he was a born god, deity, messenger, prophet or anybody’s incarnation – no. And what he found was not God. He found absolute silence: no word, no idea, no image. He found tremendous contentment, but no God; nobody there even to thank. The whole universe was there, and he was grateful to the whole universe, but it was not separate so there was no question of saying thank you to it; he was part of it.\nBuddha made no claim to be God or His image. That’s why I have loved him the most, because he is the most human of all these people.\nOf course Buddhists corrupted all his teachings, made statues of him, started worshipping him and made a god out of him. But for that he cannot be held responsible.\nYou have not asked me a question, you have made a statement. But I have still answered you, for the simple reason that anybody living close to me and carrying such statements in the mind will miss me, is bound to miss me.\nYou have to drop your answers. With your questions, I am enough to wrestle; with your answers, you wrestle at least.\nDrop them and I will kill your questions.\nThe day there is no question and no answer within you, and you are just sitting here empty – you have come home.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9240","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_ignorance_to_innocence/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_ignorance_to_innocence/>From Ignorance to Innocence</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 God \-- the nobody everybody knows</h1><div class=post-meta>44 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9240 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Ignorance_to_Innocence/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

CREATED PEOPLE LIKE JESUS CHRIST, HAZRAT MOHAMMED, KRISHNA AND
BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>IT is not a question. It is a statement, an answer, but I have not
asked the question. The person seems even to know whom God created in
His own image and whom God did not create in His own image. The person
seems to be an eyewitness. What was he doing there? Did God create him
in His own image? Then what is he doing here? But I can enjoy even
answering an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>He says God did not create people like Adolf Hitler in His own image.
What is wrong in Adolf Hitler? The followers of Adolf Hitler believe
that he was the reincarnation of the great Jewish prophet, Elijah. It is
as true as the Christian’s belief that Jesus is the only begotten son of
God, and the Mohammedan’s belief that Mohammed is the only messenger of
God. Nobody else believes it, but that is not the point. Christians
believe, the followers of Adolf Hitler also believe.</p><p><br></p><p>And Adolf Hitler was a very religious man. Let me give you a little
glimpse of Adolf Hitler’s life. He lived like a monk, in an underground
cell. He was not interested in so-called worldly things that everybody
is interested in. He was a vegetarian, he never ate any non-vegetarian
food in his whole life. He remained unmarried almost his whole life –
except for three hours, the last three hours. That is almost a whole
life; what do three hours count? And what is possible in three hours of
marriage?</p><p>The marriage was arranged after he decided to commit suicide, because
he had been harassed by this woman continually: “Why don’t you get
married to me?” and he was refusing. He lived like a monk, absolutely
alone in his cell, and he was worried that once he got married then it
would be difficult to live alone, this woman would force her way into
his room. So he went on postponing.</p><p><br></p><p>When he decided finally, Berlin was falling and the bombs were
falling on the street outside the house; he could hear the bombs
exploding from his cell. He immediately asked for a priest to be called
so that the marriage could be arranged. Marriage for what? – to commit
suicide together.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps most people do the same, not knowingly. Perhaps their three
hours are very long; and the longer they are, the more tedious.</p><p><br></p><p>A priest was somehow brought in. He quickly did the marriage
ceremony, and after the ceremony was over they drank poison and killed
themselves. His order was that petrol should be poured over them and
they should be burned completely; not even a trace should be found – and
that’s how it was done.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler used to wake up every morning before sunrise. All monks
are not so religious. I know monks are supposed to get up before sunrise
– but human beings are human beings. Adolf Hitler was made of a
different mettle. Even in winter he would get up before sunrise, and the
whole year round he would take a cold shower after getting up – the
first thing, a cold shower. A very disciplined monk... he would go to
sleep exactly at nine at night. He was not interested in anything that
you can call bad. He neither played cards nor smoked cigarettes. His
food was very simple, very frugal and he never drank wine – no alcoholic
beverages.</p><p><br></p><p>When Germany took over France, all his generals wanted him to come to
the most beautiful city in the world, but he was not interested. Beauty
was not a concern in his mind at all; but because everybody was asking
him, and they had done a great job of conquering France, he went there.
But he stayed only twenty-four hours in his hotel room and did not go to
see Paris.</p><p><br></p><p>You say God did not create Adolf Hitler in His own image. Why?
Because he killed so many people? But every day God is killing millions
of people – who else is killing them? Adolf Hitler was simply sharing a
little bit of God’s job. People have to be killed, everybody has to die;
so what is wrong in it if Adolf Hitler shares a little work, takes a
little burden off God?</p><p><br></p><p>And he did perfectly well, far better than God himself Sometimes it
happens, the carbon copy comes out clearer than the original. He
invented gas chambers, the most non-violent method of killing man; but
you cannot call it killing – killing is too cruel. In a gas chamber the
person never comes to know when he is and when he is not. It is so
quick: just a switch put on and there is only smoke – you can call it
holy smoke! He did his job perfectly.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact Hitler had this belief, this fanatic idea that he had been
sent by God to destroy all that was not right, all that was hindering
the growth of the superman on the earth. He was doing everything in good
faith.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot suspect his faith, his intention, because if he had been a
little bit suspicious it would have been impossible to do what he did,
killing millions of people. It needs tremendous faith, fanatic,</p><p>blind faith that what you are doing is the right thing. There was no
suspicion in his mind, no doubt at all that he was doing God’s work –
cleaning the world of all that was not in tune with the evolution of the
superman.</p><p><br></p><p>You say God did not create Adolf Hitler in His own image. That raises
a question: Then who created Adolf Hitler? Are there a few other gods
also? That means there is a choice; you can shop and choose in whose
shape you want to be created. You can just go into Devateerth Mall and
choose your own god: “I want to be created in this god’s image.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is an old strategy of the so-called pseudo-religious people –
that whatsoever is good belongs to God, and whatsoever is bad belongs to
the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Then who created the devil?</p><p><br></p><p>God has to take responsibility at some point or other. I cannot leave
Him out of it. If He says that Adolf Hitler is being created by His
enemy, the devil, okay, but who created the devil? God cannot shirk the
responsibility, shrug it from His shoulders. He must have created the
devil, otherwise from where does the devil come in? And if the devil can
come from somewhere else, then anybody can come from somewhere else. So
what is the need for god to create? – creation is being done somewhere
else too. God should be told, “You are not a monopolist, there are other
potters – and perhaps there may be better potters, because the world
that you have created does not seem to be a perfect world. And you seem
to be absolutely impotent: if the devil goes on smuggling his people
into your world, what are you doing there? At least you can stop this
smuggling business. And it is going on, on a tremendously vast scale. In
fact your people seem to be very few, can be counted on one’s fingers –
the devil’s people seem to be in millions.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that God goes on sitting on His throne, gossiping with
the Holy Ghost, playing with His only begotten son, Jesus; and the devil
goes on running the whole world – goes on creating Adolf Hitler, Joseph
Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Mao Tse-tung.… The whole of history seems to
be ninety-nine point nine percent a creation of the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Then why go on giving credit to God as the creator? He may be an
amateur potter – once in a while He makes a pot – but the devil seems to
be the professional. Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Alexander the
Great, Napoleon Bonaparte and Ivan the Terrible – just go down through
history – are all these people not created by God? They are, but you are
afraid to accept the fact because then your God becomes almost a
devil.</p><p><br></p><p>You say God created men like Jesus Christ, Hazrat Mohammed, Krishna
and Gautam Buddha. Let us look at these people whom you think God
created. Jesus is a Jew – born a Jew, lived a Jew, died a Jew. He had
never heard the word “Christian”, and I don’t think that he had any idea
of creating a religion called Christianity. There is no indication
anywhere even to create a suspicion that he had it in mind to create a
new religion, no. His whole life he was trying to do only one thing – to
be accepted by the Jews as their messiah.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the God of the Jews is a Jew, Jesus is a Jew, the high priest of
the Jews is a Jew. The rabbis, who are in the highest posts in the great
temple of the Jews, are all religious people, very scholarly and very
knowledgeable. It is difficult to find more scholarly people than
rabbis: their whole life is</p><p>devoted to study, to scholarship. And the high priest must have been
a great rabbi, that is why he had been chosen.</p><p><br></p><p>They decide to crucify Jesus. A Jewish God creates Jesus in His own
image, but Jewish rabbis, their high priest, and the Jewish community do
not recognize that man at all, that he is an image of God. They look
upon him as a mischief-monger, as a cheat, a deceiver.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if God sends His own son, can’t He send a small message to the
high priest: “Please take care of my son, my only begotten son,” and
they are all Jews so they all understand the same language. There would
not have been any difficulty – but He remains silent. Jesus is crucified
and God is silent; His image is destroyed and He remains absolutely
indifferent.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, Jesus is not such a disciplined man as Adolf Hitler. Jesus
drinks wine and even turns water into wine, which should be a crime. You
try turning anything into LSD! Do that miracle and you will be in jail.
Turn ordinary grass into real grass and you will find what it means to
do a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this man was turning water into wine, and he was drinking wine
without any feelings of guilt. No Hindu, no Mohammedan, no Jaina, no
Buddhist will accept this man as an image of God. An image of God
drinking alcoholic beverages! The image of God should be the pinnacle of
consciousness, and drinking anything alcoholic is just the opposite of
being conscious; it is drowning yourself in unconsciousness. It is one
of the most anti-religious acts possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This man Jesus, although he teaches about meekness and humbleness, is
very arrogant himself Buddha could not have accepted him as an image of
God. His proclamation, “I am the only son of God,” is the greatest
egoistic proclamation ever made. Adolf Hitler’s claim is not that great:
Elijah... who knows this Elijah? He must have looked into the Old
Testament and found a name somehow appealing to him for some reason,
because with Adolf Hitler you could never be sure what reason.… Perhaps
he was counting the numbers which numerology gives to each letter of the
alphabet, and found that Elijah was a good numerological name – because
these were the things in which Adolf Hitler believed – numerology,
astrology, palmistry.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that even his attacks on countries were not
decided by generals but by astrologers. In fact, this was the reason for
his continual victory in the first four years – it was not that
astrology is right but that his enemies could not figure out where he
was going to attack. If he had been listening to his generals, then of
course every other country would have been able to figure out his plans,
because all the generals think in a certain way. There is a military
science based on simple arithmetic: you don’t attack the enemy where he
is strongest; obviously you attack him where he is weakest.</p><p><br></p><p>But Adolf Hitler would attack where the enemy was strongest. And the
enemy would be thinking: “Here we are strongest; Adolf Hitler is not
going to attack here,” so they would move their armies to their weakest
point. But he was not going to attack there, because he depended on
astrology: the stars were in favor at another point, so from that point
he would attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if both sides were deciding through the generals, both sides
would have been absolutely clear where the attack was going to happen,
because both were functioning according to the same logic – but here
there was no question of logic. And Adolf Hitler’s word was law. There
was no “reason</p><p>why” – that could not be asked of Adolf Hitler. You could not ask,
“Why have you decided on this procedure...?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody was allowed to ask; even the closest people were not close
enough. Not a single man was close enough to put his hand on Adolf
Hitler’s shoulder. Nobody was a friend; Adolf Hitler never allowed any
friendship. He was far above that... the reincarnation of the prophet
Elijah, and you ordinary human beings crawling on the earth – and you
ask him why?</p><p><br></p><p>So for four years he was continually winning, until Winston Churchill
himself had to come down to the same rules, against his will. This was
stupid, but what to do? – if you are fighting with an idiot, you have to
be an idiot, otherwise you are going to be the loser. He had to call
astrologers from India, because that is where you can find the best
astrologers. And the Indian astrologers felt tremendously great, that
finally even Winston Churchill had understood that, “Astrology is a
science and we are far more advanced than you are.</p><p><br></p><p>And certainly Winston Churchill started winning with the entry of
astrology, because now he was also going crazy. He was a great general
but now he was doing things against himself, against his whole reason
and experience – but what to do? “That other fellow will be listening to
the astrologers – you have to listen to astrologers. And it is a
question of victory, so it is not the time to argue about astrology; the
time for that argument we can find later on. First finish this man and
this mad situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>When Winston Churchill started listening to the astrologers, he
started winning because he also began attacking in a crazy way, with no
logic. And certainly he had stranger astrologers than Adolf Hitler,
because Adolf Hitler’s astrologers were western: you could find in
London the same kind of astrologers who could tell you what those German
astrologers would be suggesting to Adolf Hitler. But these Indian
astrologers had a totally different astrology.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler had no way to find out what these astrologers were
suggesting, because both were different in their workings. Even in
palmistry... in western palmistry some line shows something; in Indian
palmistry the same line shows something else – because there is nothing
written on the line. It depends on you, what you want to make out of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus died on the cross – that does not seem to be the right place
for the son of God. And if you ask Jainas, Buddhists and Hindus, you
will find an answer in what they say. You will be surprised also with
their answer, but their answer seems to be more rational. They say, “He
must have committed some great sin in his past life and this is the
outcome of that great sin – the simple law of karma – otherwise why
should he be crucified?</p><p><br></p><p>“No Hindu avatara is crucified, no Jaina tirthankara is crucified, no
Buddha is crucified – that is impossible! In fact when Mahavira, the
Jaina tirthankara, walks on the road” – and in those days there were no
tar roads or cement roads, just muddy tracks – and if there is a thorn
on the road it will immediately turn its pointed part downwards so that
Mahavira’s feet remain unhurt and unharmed.</p><p><br></p><p>Because that man has finished with all his karmas, even a thorn
cannot hurt him – what to say of a cross! Even a thorn has to consider
that,‘a man is coming here who is finished with all his karmas. You
cannot bother him; you had better put yourself in such a position that
you don’t hurt him.”’ Now, these people – how can they accept Christ as
the son of God, a messiah?</p><p>In Buddhist scriptures there are so many incidents described. A mad
elephant was released towards Buddha to kill him. The mad elephant had
killed many people; whoever came in his way, he finished them. He was
kept in chains by the king, just for the simple purpose of killing
criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole royal family, their advisors and their ministers, would sit
on the balconies of the palace and enjoy the game. Down on the ground
the criminal would be standing; the elephant would be brought in and his
chains taken away. He would rush immediately towards the man who would
run and scream; and all those people would enjoy it, just as you enjoy a
bullfight or Mohammed Ali’s boxing. All these are of the same type,
there is not much difference: what you are enjoying is violence. But the
elephant was bound to kill him – where could he escape?</p><p><br></p><p>This elephant was sent to kill Buddha, but even the mad elephant
recognized, when he saw Buddha, that this man was finished with all his
karmas; you could not hurt him – rather this was an opportunity to touch
his feet and to earn some good karma for your future life. So he touched
Buddha’s feet and sat down there. The king could not believe his eyes.
They had all followed what had happened, so they asked Buddha, “Only you
can say what happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Nothing special. The elephant is wiser than you. He can see
that all my karmas are finished and I have no more to suffer, my
accounts are closed, the balance sheet is complete – whatever I have
done, I have suffered for it, and I am completely clean. Seeing this,
the elephant thought,‘Why miss this opportunity? Where will I find such
a man?’ So he is touching my feet to be blessed. In fact he is already
blessed; he has already gained enough virtue – he will be born in his
future life as a great buddha. He will become enlightened himself,
because if he can recognize a Buddha even in madness, then he is not
identified with his madness. He is still aware that he is
different.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, do you think Buddhists will accept Jesus, the image of God,
being crucified? Even an elephant can see when a Buddha is there; yet
those thousands of Jews were there and nobody could see, not a single
person, that this man was the image of God and you should not destroy
him. It is just your conditioning... otherwise no other religion is
going to accept Jesus in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>He is mixing with people – Mahavira will not allow his monks to mix,
what to say of Mahavira himself Jesus is mixing with gamblers,
prostitutes, thieves – the lowest strata of society. Mahavira will not
allow it, Buddha will not allow it. And why is he mixing with those
people? – because nobody else is ready to mix with him. The high
classes, the richer classes, the educated and cultured and sophisticated
people were not ready even to mix with this carpenter’s son-uneducated,
a village idiot – who was declaring himself son of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one time had a professor come to him, and that too, in the
middle of the night. He was a rabbi and a known professor, Nicodemus. He
had come in the night when there was nobody around and all the apostles
had fallen asleep. Jesus was doing his last prayer before he went to
sleep. In the dark came this very respected, rich rabbi, a professor in
the university, and he introduced himself Jesus said, “Why don’t you
come in the day? It is the middle of the night; I was just going to
sleep. I have just finished my last prayer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nicodemus said, “In the day I cannot come because people will see
that I associate with a man like you. I have heard about you so much
that curiosity has brought me here, but in the day I cannot</p><p>admit the fact that I came to see you.” The higher class people were
not mixing – what to say of mixing – they were not even ready to talk to
this man.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the son of God, created in His own image – and nobody in the
whole of Judea could recognize him except those few fools who had no
religious education, no understanding. They were fishers, woodcutters,
farmers – and they enjoyed the idea of being associated with the only
son of God because that gave them the hope that, “When we reach the
kingdom of God we will be with the son, close to God. Then all these
rich people, these kings, these viceroys and these rabbis will see who
we are. Right now we are only fishermen, woodcutters, farmers<span class=s4></span>” So that was their hope. That’s</p><p>why it was so cheap to enter the kingdom of God with Jesus. This
opportunity was not to be missed. But he could find only those twelve
people in the whole of Judea.</p><p><br></p><p>No great religion in the East will accept him, because a man is known
by his company, and his company was certainly not good. And that company
became his apostles, that company created Christianity; so if
Christianity is a third-rate religion there is no wonder about it – it
has come from a very thirdrate source. It hasn’t the profundity of
Jainism or Buddhism or Hinduism: there is no comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are asking about Hazrat Mohammed. Now what do you see in
Hazrat Mohammed that you think he can be proclaimed as the image of God?
For his whole life he was a killer. His hand was always on his sword,
even in his sleep: his whole life was a continual war. Of course on his
sword he had written, “Peace is my mission.” A strange peace, that you
have to write on your sword, “Peace is my mission.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with the sword Mohammed wanted to bring peace into the world.
Either you accepted that he was the messenger of God or you were
finished – that was the peace. In both ways there would be peace: either
you became Mohammedan and there was peace, or you were no more and there
was peace. Certainly that message on his sword was really meaningful.
You could choose: two kinds of peace he allowed you.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedanism had converted millions just on the fear of death: man’s
lust for life is such that he will be ready to do anything. And what was
he asking? It is nothing to make much of a fuss about. His religion is
simple, almost a simpleton’s religion: repeat the name of Allah five
times and for one month every year – the month of Ramadan – keep a fast
in the day. In the night you can eat; in the night there is a feast, so
the whole day you fast and in the night you feast.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a strange kind of fasting – in India it is just the opposite.
In the night you cannot eat at all – fasting, not fasting, that is not
the question; but while you are fasting then it is absolutely impossible
to eat in the night. The sun has gone down, life has gone to sleep – and
this is not the time for eating.</p><p><br></p><p>And it seems to be rational and reasonable that when the sun is there
digestion is easier. You will be working, you will be perspiring, you
will be doing something; digestion is easier. When in the night the sun
has gone down and you are going to sleep, if you eat, then digestion is
not going to be good. It is a simple fact.</p><p><br></p><p>But why did Mohammed choose the other way? The reason was that the
whole day they were fighting. In the night the fight had to stop because
in darkness, in the desert you could not fight, so</p><p>in the night you could eat and enjoy. In the day, the month of
Ramadan is a month of fasting and fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are fighting it is good to fast so you are not bothered
by food. Otherwise you need a foodbreak, a teabreak, a coffeebreak, and
in war you cannot make all these breaks; in war you have to be totally
in it, no break. In the desert, when the sun sets, war ends; you cannot
fight in the night. Then you are free; then with ease, with comfort you
can eat, dance and enjoy yourself late into the night and then go to
sleep – and be ready again in the morning with the sword to bring peace
into the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed killed an uncountable number of people, and his followers
have been killing people for these fifteen hundred years continually. I
don’t think there is anybody – Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Jew or Jaina
– who can kill as easily as a Mohammedan. A Jaina of course cannot even
kill an ant – that is enough to go to hell. Killing a man is unheard
of.</p><p><br></p><p>In the whole of history not a single Jaina has been sentenced to
death because he murdered; it is not possible. He can be murdered, but
he cannot murder. Even if you give him a sword, it will fall from his
hand immediately; he cannot hold it – he may not even know how to hold
it. Except for the small knife that he uses in the kitchen, he knows
nothing about any weapon. He will find it easier to be killed than to
kill... because if you are killed you are not going to fall into hell,
and if you are killed without any resistance, then heaven is yours: just
the opposite of the Mohammedan.</p><p><br></p><p>If you kill somebody in a war of religion, a jihad, what Christians
call a crusade... and all wars are jihads. They are for religion: they
are to convert the other person. And Mohammedanism has used the lowest
kind of methodology to pervert – yes, I would like to say pervert – a
man into Mohammedanism. I would not like to use the word convert.…</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of conversion is this? You have not even had a little
conversation before it, you don’t give any opportunity to the man. You
simply say, “Either you believe in one God; one prophet, that is
Mohammed; and one holy book, that is the Koran.<span class=s4></span>These three things you have to believe, that’s</p><p>all, then you are a Mohammedan – otherwise, accept death.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed says the more people you bring to Mohammedanism, the more
virtue you are attaining. And if you have to kill many people, don’t be
afraid: that too will be counted as virtue, because you have saved those
people from remaining heretics all their life. The man may have lived
forty years more, so you have saved him from forty years of a heretic’s
life. That much compassion you have shown to that man! Strange logic!
But all these pseudo-religions are full of strange logic.</p><p><br></p><p>Hazrat Mohammed had nine wives – God has not even one! And God
created Mohammed in His own image? What kind of image<span class=s4></span>? He should have remained celibate, but he married
nine women</p><p>and allowed all Mohammedans to marry four women. The reason was that
Mohammed wanted more and more soldiers. From where to get soldiers? One
woman can get married to four men but then too in one year she will give
birth to only one child, so that is absolutely uneconomical. But if four
women are married to one man then certainly they can give birth to four
children in one year. He wanted more and more Mohammedans, more and more
children, more and more soldiers – and this was a way to find them. But
where are you going to find so many women?</p><p>So for that there is also a good strategy: you can steal anybody’s
woman and you can convert the woman to Mohammedanism. Now in India, a
woman who has been converted by the Mohammedans – if even for one night
she has remained in a Mohammedan house – will not be accepted back into
a Jaina family or in a brahmin family or in a Buddhist family. That is
impossible because Mohammedans are thought to be the worst people in the
world – the woman has remained the whole night with those people and
they have even converted her – and their method of conversion is
something which creates nausea in Jainas, Buddhists, brahmins, everybody
in India.</p><p><br></p><p>The conversion method is that you have to eat with Mohammedans from
one plate. So four, five, six... as many Mohammedans as are available
will all sit around a table – their brotherhood is guaranteed now. The
new person who is being converted will also eat from the same plate with
them and then they will all drink from the same cup; the new person has
also to drink from the same cup. Now, to any other Indian religion this
is not acceptable at all. I know, because I had Mohammedan friends, and
it was such a difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends in the university who was almost not a Mohammedan,
he was just born a Mohammedan – because a fanatic Mohammedan cannot be
friendly with me at all.<span class=s4></span>Listening</p><p>to me, still he remained my friend; that was enough proof that he had
an open mind. Professor Farid was his name, and many times he would come
with me to my village which was eighty miles from the university. Once
in a while I would drive to the village just to see my father because he
was so much attached to me that if I did not come for eight or ten days,
then he would come to see me; he would not be satisfied that everything
was okay without seeing me. He was always afraid that something was
going to be wrong.</p><p>So rather than troubling him I used to drive there, and Farid many
times came with me. I had to explain to him, “Listen, you are going to a
Jaina family, so don’t feel offended – even I am not allowed in the
kitchen, so what about you! They suspect me of eating with Mohammedans
and Christians<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that the Hindu word for Christian is Kristan.
In the beginning Kristan was used for the Christian, but by and by it
became associated with something wrong, something bad. So if you are
doing something wrong, they will say, “Don’t behave like a Kristan.”
First I was puzzled that Kristan is the Hindi for Christian, but then I
understood why: because to them, a Christian or a Mohammedan belong to
the anti-religious – their religions are not worth anything.</p><p><br></p><p>So I told Farid, “We will be sitting outside when eating, and you
will be given a special plate that is kept separate, because they know
that once in a while I bring a Christian or a Mohammedan home. So they
keep a whole set separate and nobody in the family will touch that set.”
I had to bring it in and put it before my friend; then I had to clean it
because nobody else was going to clean it. I said, “Don’t feel offended
in any way; this is just how things are. And don’t disturb these people,
because even this much is too much for them – that just outside their
kitchen a Mohammedan is sitting; this is too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>So it was very easy in India to get hold of anybody’s woman and just
keep her one or two days in your house; then she could not go back. Even
if she wanted to, even if you were ready to send her back, she could not
go back; she had to get married to you – there was no other way. They
converted millions of women in this way; and with the women came the
increase in population. But this is ugly.</p><p>If you convince somebody about your truth and he wants to come and
belong to your fold, it seems human. But to threaten him, “You will be
killed if you don’t become a Mohammedan,” and out of that threat he
decides to live as a Mohammedan rather than to die as a Hindu – this is
not at all religious. But this is what Mohammed brought into the world –
and he was the only messenger. He is so uneducated, so ignorant that
what he says does not look like philosophy, not like great treatises
like the Upanishads, or the Tao Te Ching, or the Dhammapada – nothing
like it. Just such things he is saying in the Koran, that a Mohammedan
can marry four women, it is his religious right. And this persists.…</p><p><br></p><p>In India now the constitution gives the right to have only one woman,
but still Mohammedans go on marrying four women; and you cannot
interfere, because if you interfere, immediately riots break out all
over India. Thousands will be killed immediately and nothing will be
changed. Simply thousands will be killed, thousands of houses will be
burned, temples will be burned – so it is better to tolerate it. The
constitution is there, the law is there, but who cares?</p><p><br></p><p>The Mohammedan goes on doing this because it is his religious
principle, and you should not interfere in his religion. The government
is secular, so it cannot interfere. It is strange, some religion can
make cannibalism its principle, then you can start eating human beings
and the government cannot do anything, because it is your religion and
they should not interfere in religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed is not much different from Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Genghis
Khan or Adolf Hitler. No, not different at all, he was just born in a
different age so he speaks in a different language, which is more of a
religious jargon; otherwise he is the same type of man – a criminal
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me about Krishna. You must have thought that I would at least
accept Krishna and Buddha as the images of God – no. There is no God in
the first place so how can there be any image? And whoever you bring
before me as an image, I am going to hammer hard on. It is a fight with
the fictitious God; it is not a fight with Jesus, Mohammed, Krishna or
Buddha. If that fictitious God is finished with, much of the glory of
these people will be demolished.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is no God, then “I am the only begotten son” cannot be said.
Then, “I bring the message of God, and only my message is true because
it comes from God” cannot be said. So I am trying to destroy the fiction
of God. Of course I will have to beat the images too, because just by
being God’s image they go on giving life to a fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is one of the most cunning politicians the world has ever
known; and perhaps in the future also it will not be possible to have
such a cunning politician. He is not a man of his word at all: that’s
why I call him a politician. He will say one thing and will do exactly
the opposite. He will make you a promise and he will break the promise
any moment he finds that it is in his favor to do so. You cannot rely on
him at all. His whole life is full of using people’s trust, taking
advantage, deceiving... but the Hindus go on saying, “This is God’s
play.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can always find good words for anything. The young girls of the
town would be taking a bath in the river and he would collect all their
clothes and sit in a nearby tree. Now, they would be asking for their
clothes, standing naked in the water<span class=s4></span>Anybody else
doing such a thing would be immediately</p><p>taken to the police station. But in many Hindu families you will find
this picture hanging – of course not in those houses where I have
stayed.…</p><p>Once, when I stayed with a Hindu family who had the picture in their
home, I said, “You should be ashamed – keeping this picture here, just
in your sitting room. You think you are displaying some great
religiousness – this is religiousness? If I did the same with your wife
and with your daughter, then...?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Yes, if I actually do this, what Krishna was doing, that
would be God’s play. Why should he be an exception?” Sixteen thousand
wives were stolen by Krishna, forcibly taken away from people, from
their husbands and from their children. He must have created a great
concentration camp for these wives. And I don’t think that he would have
recognized who was his wife and who wasn’t. And I don’t think that this
is in any way an exaggeration.</p><p><br></p><p>In India it used to happen: kings used to have hundreds of wives.
Even today, the Nizam of Hyderabad, who died just a few years ago, left
five hundred wives behind him – five hundred widows... one man. So
sixteen thousand doesn’t seem too big a number – only thirty-two times
more than the Nizam of Hyderabad. And Krishna is certainly thirty-two
times more wealthy than the Nizam of Hyderabad.</p><p><br></p><p>The person’s richness was counted by how many wives he had. A poor
man could not afford even one wife; for a poor man to have one wife,
only one wife, was difficult – he could not manage even two meals a day
for himself So the way, in ancient India, to show how wealthy you were,
was to have many wives – and Krishna defeated everybody. Just to defeat
everybody, sixteen thousand wives and sixteen thousand families were
destroyed. Their children may have become orphans or beggars – what
happened nobody knows – but this man is thought to be the image of
God!</p><p><br></p><p>You can’t see his cruelty? And it is not for love’s sake: he does not
even know these women. How can you know sixteen thousand women? What
love can you give to sixteen thousand women? What relatedness is
possible with these women? They are just imprisoned to show your
greatness.</p><p><br></p><p>The same egoistic attitude, perhaps even stronger<span class=s4></span>Krishna says to his disciple, Arjuna: “Surrender</p><p>at my feet. Leaving aside everything – your doubts, your thinking –
leave aside everything, just surrender at my feet. I am your salvation,
I am your refuge.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, anybody saying that seems to be ugly. If it were true, then even
Arjuna would recognize it himself You need not declare it, you need not
persistently say to him, “Surrender at my feet.” Certainly he is not
surrendering, hence the insistence. He is continually arguing, bringing
doubts, questions; and he is not convinced – I don’t think he was ever
convinced.</p><p><br></p><p>I have tried hard to look into the whole conversation between Arjuna
and Krishna – that is the Shrimad Bhagavadgita, the whole conversation.
The way Arjuna is arguing is perfectly right and the doubts he is
raising are perfectly valid; but what Krishna is saying – his answers
are not justified. They don’t dispel the doubts and they don’t dispel
Arjuna’s confusion; hence, tired of arguing with Arjuna, Krishna says,
“Leave everything aside and simply surrender at my feet, because I am
the perfect incarnation of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have to say it, then I say, you are not! If the other
recognizes it even though you deny it, then perhaps there is something
to it. If you are denying it, but the other goes on seeing something</p><p>which is more than can be understood by the mind, which is more than
can be comprehended by intellect.<span class=s4></span>If the other
goes on feeling it, the presence of it, the smell of it – and against
your denial</p><p>he says, “You can go on denying it, I don’t care; I listen to my
heart, and my heart is saying something to me” – that is something
totally different. But that does not happen in the whole conversation in
the Gita.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna simply forces him; and seeing the situation and the
awkwardness of the situation, because they are standing on the
battlefield.<span class=s4></span>Krishna is functioning as his
charioteer and both armies are</p><p>facing each other, just about to begin the war for which they have
been preparing for years and which is going to be decisive for the whole
of India. And it proved to be decisive: it destroyed the very backbone
of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Three men I find responsible for India’s downfall. The first is
Krishna, because he destroyed India’s zest, gusto for fighting. He drove
India into a kind of third world war, in which almost the whole country
was devastated and destroyed. Everybody – whosoever was alive – became
so shaken and afraid of war that they were ready to do anything rather
than go to war.</p><p><br></p><p>And then came Buddha and Mahavira who started talking about
non-violence. That appealed very much to people who were so tired of
war. And they had seen such a great war that they never wanted to have
anything to do with it again. It would be better to be slaves rather
than to have such a war and such destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahabharata is the name of the war, the great Indian war; after that
there have been only battles – nothing like the great Indian war. Its
magnitude was almost universal: whatsoever was known of the world at
that time, every part of that world joined in the war, either from this
side or from that side. Both sides were cousin-brothers and the problem
was: who should inherit the kingdom?</p><p><br></p><p>On one side were one hundred kauravas, one hundred brothers. Now you
can see, the father was blind yet he must have had thousands of wives –
even a blind fellow managed to produce one hundred sons – and his
brother had five sons, the pandavas. The conflict was: who is going to
inherit the kingdom? They could not negotiate in any way, so that was
the only way to decide: go to war. And because it was one family, all
the relatives were divided – somebody was fighting from that side,
somebody was fighting from this side; a brother from that side, another
brother from this side – and there were all their friends from all over
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that Arjuna had one wife from Mexico
too – Mexican kings had come with their armies to fight on Arjuna’s
side. The Sanskrit name for Mexico is makshika; Mexico is a distortion
of Makshika. Now much historical evidence has been collected and it is
certain that Makshika is Mexico. In Mexico, Hindu temples have been
found, Hindu gods and goddesses and their statues have been found. And
the latest discovery is that there was a time when the water between
Asia and America, the ocean water, was so shallow that you could simply
walk from America to Asia. You could simply walk over the ocean; it was
one foot deep at the most.</p><p><br></p><p>So the whole known world at that time had gathered for this decisive
battle and all were ready for the signal to be given. But they were
waiting because Krishna was still persuading Arjuna. Arjuna wanted to
leave; he said, “I want to renounce war because I don’t see any point in
it. All these people are my people: on this side are my people, on that
side are my people. I see my friends on that side</p><p>that I will have to kill and I see my friends on this side. These
people, these hundred Kauravas are my brothers, and I have to kill these
people just for the kingdom? Millions of people will be killed in the
war – and even if we win, who will there be to rejoice in the
victory?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was absolutely right. “Who will there be to rejoice in the
victory over the corpses of millions of relatives and friends? These are
the people for whom we would have fought, for whom we would have won the
victory so that they could rejoice with us, celebrate with us – but all
these people will be dead. There is no certainty we will win, there is
no certainty that the other party will win, because both are equally
balanced. But one thing is certain: whosoever wins, almost everybody
will be dead.” And that’s what happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Krishna argued: “You are a coward, you are an impotent man
escaping from the warfield; you are a warrior, and the religion of the
warrior is to fight. Are you afraid of killing, of murdering? – but
these people are going to die anyway.” Just see the argument, what he is
saying: “These people are going to die anyway, anyday. Nobody is
immortal, so if you murder these people you are not doing anything that
you have to be worried about. Perhaps you have taken a few years off
this man’s life, but in that too you are wrong to think that you are
doing: the doer is God, and whatsoever happens, happens through His will
– we are only His instruments.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I was telling you – that these religions have been
reducing humanity to puppets. Krishna’s whole Gita can be condensed in a
single sentence: “Man is a puppet; the puppeteer is God.” So whatever
the puppeteer wants, you do: if He makes you dance, you dance, if He
makes you jog, you jog; whatsoever He makes you do, you leave everything
to God. You simply act and don’t think of the consequences and the
results. That’s the whole message of the Gita, on which the whole of
Hinduism stands: you go on surrendering everything to God, and don’t
bother about the result – the result is in His hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a very tricky argument. If I had been in Arjuna’s place I
would have slapped Krishna then and there, told him to get down from the
chariot and said, “I am going – because this is the will of God. Who am
I to think? Now my whole being is saying to renounce this war; I am
going. This is my God’s voice. Who are you? And I am not going to think
about the consequences, that people will think me a coward. Let them
think it – that is their business.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact the argument that Krishna is giving to Arjuna is so bogus
that if Arjuna had had a little insight into argumentation he could have
turned the whole thing round. Krishna is saying, “Only do, and don’t
think of the result.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arjuna should have said, “Great! So I will only do this, and I will
not bother about the result” – and he should have turned his chariot
towards the jungle.</p><p><br></p><p>But he got befooled, perhaps by the situation or the pressure. He had
collected all these people, he had invited all these people, and now at
the last moment to escape<span class=s4></span>“What will the world
say?</p><p>And Krishna is God’s incarnation – that’s what people say – and if he
is saying,‘Fight and leave the consequences in God’s hands,’ then I
should fight.” So he fought and they won. But whatsoever he was afraid
of did happen. The whole country has never been again alive in the same
way as it was before. It lost its backbone, it lost its manliness.</p><p>I cannot say that Krishna is the image of God. He is far closer to
Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, or Mao Tse-tung than to God. This is what
Adolf Hitler was doing, what poor Adolf Hitler was doing – why should he
be condemned? He was doing God’s will and not bothering about the
consequences. It was the same thing with Krishna: he forced Arjuna to do
something that he wanted, argued for it – and destroyed the country for
at least five thousand years. It is still not free of the shadow of the
Mahabharata: that great war still falls like a shadow on India.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last the questioner asks about is Gautam Buddha. He must have
thought that at least I will agree about Gautam Buddha – but he is
wrong. In the first place Gautam Buddha does not believe in God, that
God exists, so he will not agree that he is an image of God. He himself
would disagree with this statement, that he is an image of God. He does
not believe in God. He himself cannot say he is an image of God, and he
has never said that.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of “the image of God” is inapplicable to Gautam Buddha
– Krishna is born as an incarnation of God, Jesus is born as the only
son of God, Mohammed is born as the only messenger of God, but this is
not the case with Buddha. He is born a human being, and he goes in
search for truth. If he were made in the image of God he would have
known the truth already, but he goes in search, a long search.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha takes immense pains in every possible way to find out the
truth. He does everything he is told. He goes to all the teachers that
were well-known in the country until each teacher says, “Now I cannot
teach you any more because whatsoever I knew, I have taught you. You
move on, go somewhere else; you know more than I know now.” But this
knowledge was not satisfying. He did everything, and that was his basic
mistake: all the teachers got fed up with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Teachers never get fed up with a person who goes on committing
mistakes. Then the teacher is always happy: “You committed this mistake,
that’s why you are missing; you committed that mistake, that’s why you
are missing.” But this man was so particular that he was overdoing what
the teacher was saying. No teacher – and he was with dozens of teachers
– could say to him that he had failed because he had not done something,
he had missed something. No, every teacher understood that he had done
everything – and nothing had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>He is standing there saying, “You said all these things are to be
done; I think they have been done to completion. If not, tell me where
the mistake is, and I am going to correct it. But nothing is happening.
The teachers soon realized that they could not cheat and exploit this
man – he was ready to go to any length.</p><p><br></p><p>But a point comes where the teacher becomes afraid because he himself
does not know. He is just a scholar, a great scholar maybe; he can teach
you all the methods but he himself has never done them. He knows no
truth; he has not realized himself, so this man becomes a question mark
to him, because he is doing exactly what is being told and yet nothing
is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the last teacher he was with told him, “Don’t waste your time
with teachers. I am the greatest of all those teachers; many of them
have been my students. Seeing in your eyes your sincerity, your
authenticity, I would like to say to you that you have to go on your
own. Nobody can take you there, nobody can lead you there; you have to
go there on your own. So forget about teachers, forget about teachings
and just move on your own. You have done enough of all these
disciplines, yogas,</p><p>mantras, tantras – all that is available.” And India is a great
bazaar, buzzing with all kinds of things that you can do; it can drive
you on for many lives. And those methods will not end; they are always
there, and new ones too.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha understood it because he had wasted twelve years and he was
nowhere. But really, he had achieved something without being aware of
it: he was finished with following. And that is a great achievement. To
become religious, that is one of the greatest achievements: to be
finished with following.</p><p><br></p><p>He went alone. He himself had gathered, in those years, five
followers. He told them also, “Forgive me, but all those teachers wasted
my time and I don’t want to waste your time – you go on your own. Leave
me alone and I will leave you alone. I am not your leader, and you are
not my followers. From now onwards I am alone. I will risk everything,
but if there is any truth, I will find it; if there is none, I will find
that.”</p><p><br></p><p>This man has never claimed that he was a born god, deity, messenger,
prophet or anybody’s incarnation – no. And what he found was not God. He
found absolute silence: no word, no idea, no image. He found tremendous
contentment, but no God; nobody there even to thank. The whole universe
was there, and he was grateful to the whole universe, but it was not
separate so there was no question of saying thank you to it; he was part
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha made no claim to be God or His image. That’s why I have loved
him the most, because he is the most human of all these people.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course Buddhists corrupted all his teachings, made statues of him,
started worshipping him and made a god out of him. But for that he
cannot be held responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not asked me a question, you have made a statement. But I
have still answered you, for the simple reason that anybody living close
to me and carrying such statements in the mind will miss me, is bound to
miss me.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to drop your answers. With your questions, I am enough to
wrestle; with your answers, you wrestle at least.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop them and I will kill your questions.</p><p><br></p><p>The day there is no question and no answer within you, and you are
just sitting here empty – you have come home.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

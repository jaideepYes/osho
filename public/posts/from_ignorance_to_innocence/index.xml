‌CHAPTER 1
Pseudo-religion: the stick-on soul
29 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS HUMANITY TODAY BECOMING MORE AND MORE MISERABLE?
THE cause is very simple, perhaps too simple. It is very close, very obvious, and this is the reason why most of the people go on missing seeing it. When something is very obvious you start taking it for granted.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
God – the nobody everybody knows
8 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
GOD DID NOT CREATE PEOPLE LIKE ADOLF HITLER IN HIS OWN IMAGE. HE CREATED PEOPLE LIKE JESUS CHRIST, HAZRAT MOHAMMED, KRISHNA AND BUDDHA.
IT is not a question. It is a statement, an answer, but I have not asked the question. The person seems even to know whom God created in His own image and whom God did not create in His own image.</description>

Truth: not a dogma but a dance
9 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
ARE YOU AGAINST ALL THE RELIGIONS? WHAT IS THEIR MOST FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE?
YES, I am against all the so-called religions because they are not religions at all. I am for religion but not for the religions.
The true religion can only be one, just like science.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Faith: the suicide of intelligence
10 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE GREATEST HARM THAT THE SO-CALLED RELIGIONS HAVE DONE TO HUMANITY?
THE greatest harm that the so-called religions have done to humanity is to prevent humanity from finding the true religion.
They pretended to be the true religion. All the religions of the world have conditioned the human mind from the very childhood to believe that this is the true religion – the religion in which you are born.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Ecstasy is knowing that nobody is holding your hand
11 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IN YOUR RELIGION – TO BE THYSELF OR TO KNOW THYSELF?
Do you think they are different? How can you know yourself if you are not yourself? And vice versa – how can you be yourself if you don’t know who you are?</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Society crowds you out; religon outs your crowd
13 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY, IN THE FIRST PLACE, HAVE PEOPLE BEEN DISTRACTED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL SELF?
MAN is born with an unknown, an unknowable potentiality.
His original face is not available when he comes into the world. He has to find it. It is going to be a discovery, and that is the beauty of it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
They say believe; I say explore
14 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A POLITICIAN TO BE A RELIGIOUS MAN OR FOR A RELIGIOUS MAN TO BE A POLITICIAN?
IT is absolutely impossible for a political man to be religious, because the ways of politics and religion are diametrically opposite.
You have to understand that it is not a question of adding something to your personality – religion is not an addition.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
Let’s not face it – you’re absolutely alone
15 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
IS THE HYPOTHESIS OF GOD NOT USEFUL IN ANY WAY? – BECAUSE THE VERY IDEA OF DROPPING THE IDEA OF GOD MAKES ME IMMENSELY AFRAID.
IT is already too late. The moment one starts calling the idea of God a hypothesis, the idea of God is already dropped.</description>

Jesus, the only forgotten son of god
16 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
YOU SAY GOD IS NOT A HYPOTHESIS NOR AN IDEA. THEN WHAT IS GOD? HAS ANYONE EVER MET GOD OR NOT?
GOD certainly is not a hypothesis.
A hypothesis can only be part of an objective science. You can experiment upon it, you can dissect it, analyze it.</description>

One god, one messenger, one book – one big lie
17 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RELIGION AND A CULT? – BECAUSE THE CHRISTIANS GO ON CALLING US A CULT. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACCEPT US AS A RELIGION. WHAT COULD BE THE REASON BEHIND IT?
IT is a complex question.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
IS IT NOT POSSIBLE IN ANY WAY TO PRESERVE YOUR LIVING RELIGION AND NOT LET IT BE REDUCED TO A CULT LIKE CHRISTIANITY? THE VERY IDEA OF YOUR RELIGION BEING REDUCED WITH TIME TO A CULT IS UNBEARABLE.
IT is almost impossible to preserve a religion as a religion.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The other cheek: the masochist’s slap-up feast
30 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF NONVIOLENCE AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN DOGMA OF TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK?
I am not a philosopher. The philosopher thinks about things. It is a mind approach. My approach is a no-mind approach. It is just the very opposite of philosophizing.</description>

Surrender: the ego upside down
19 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
This tapes of this discourse were erased the day after it was given, this transcription appeared a week later.
Question 1 OSHO,
ISN’T ORGANIZATION A NECESSITY FOR A RELIGION TO SURVIVE? UNFORTUNATELY, it is.
Religion needs some kind of organization, but the problem arises. Organization in itself is a political entity; organization does not need religion at all.</description>

20 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY WERE YOU SO MISCHIEVOUS IN YOUR CHILDHOOD?
Do you think I am different? Not a bit. I am still the same. I did not allow my childhood to be spoiled by anybody. And what you think of as mischievous, I have never thought about it in that way.</description>

21 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ONESELF. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE PARADOX OF BEING AN INDIVIDUAL AND MELTING INTO THE COMMUNE?
THERE is no paradox as such, as far as the individual and his melting into the commune is concerned.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
Conscience: a coffin for consciousness
22 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
IS THERE ANY POINT IN LIVING?
MAN has been brought up by all the traditions in a schizophrenic way.
It was helpful to divide man in every possible dimension, and create a conflict between the divisions. This way man becomes weak, shaky, fearful, ready to submit, surrender; ready to be enslaved by the priests, by the politicians, by anybody.</description>

YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT DISOBEDIENCE IS A RELIGIOUS QUALITY IT SUDDENLY MEANS I HAVE TO DISOBEY YOU, THE COMMUNE AND THE DISCIPLINE OF SANNYAS. I CANNOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN OUR PRAYER, THE GACHCHHAMIS.

THESE idiots are all over the world, perhaps more so in Oregon. The very idea of saving somebody is violent.</description>

25 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
HOW DOES ONE EXPLORE THE HIGHER STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS?
THERE are not many ways, there is but one: the way of awareness.
Man is almost unconscious. I say “almost” – there are moments, situations where he becomes conscious, but they are momentary.</description>

27 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove

IT SEEMS THAT ALL THE PIONEERS IN ART AND SCIENCE HAVE REACHED THE UNKNOWN SPACES THROUGH SOME KIND OF OBSESSIONS. WHAT KIND OF OBSESSIONS HAS THE NEW RELIGIOUS MAN?

I do not teach the ego, hence I cannot teach surrender, because surrender is nothing but the subtlest form of the ego.
Surrender is not against the ego, it is in fact an act of the ego. Who surrenders? And by surrendering, who becomes humble?</description>

2 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY ARE THE COMMON MASSES AGAINST YOU, WHEN WHAT YOU SAY APPEARS TO US THE VERY TRUTH?
THAT’S precisely why – because it appears to be the very truth.
Truth is dangerous, dangerous to all those people who have been living in fictions, beautiful lies, nice dreams, utopias.</description>

3 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS RENUNCIATION? WHAT IS ITS PLACE IN YOUR RELIGION?
THE idea of renunciation is one of the fundamentals of all pseudo-religions. Its phenomenology has to be understood very deeply.
All the religions have been preaching a division between this world and that world which is beyond death – between the soul and the body.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,

‌CHAPTER 8
God is not a solution but a problem
6 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST?

‌CHAPTER 9
I teach a religionless religion
7 December 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST. THEN THE QUESTION AROSE IN ME: HOW CAN THERE BE ANY RELIGION WITHOUT GOD? ISN’T GOD THE CENTER AND RELIGION THE CIRCUMFERENCE?
IT is fortunate that you were shocked. It needs intelligence to be shocked</description>

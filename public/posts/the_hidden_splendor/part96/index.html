It is just that you are focusing yourself on the wrong spot.\nYour lover is only an excuse. Let your lover be just an experience of a greater love -- the love for the whole existence.\nLet your longing be a search of your own inner being; there, the meeting is already happening, there, we are already one.\nThere, nobody has ever separated.\nThe longing is perfectly right; only the object of longing is not right. That is\ncreating the suffering and the hell. Just change the object and your life becomes a paradise.\nOkay Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 206\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world 21\nThe greatest misfit in the world\n23 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nAS ANOTHER OF YOUR COMMUNES TAKES OFF THE GROUND, I STRONGLY\nDEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF A MISFIT. INDIA, AND EVEN A COMMUNE, JUST DOES\nNOT SEEM TO BE THE PLACE WHERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE. IS THERE SUCH A STATE AS \"DOING YOUR OWN THING, CONTENT AND FULL OF GRATITUDE\"\nTHAT IS NOT JUST AN EGO TRIP?\nPrem Leeladhar, I myself am an unfit. And this place here has gone far beyond being a commune. The commune was an alternative society. But it has its own organization, its own rules, regulations. Seeing that for misfits it will be difficult to be part of even a commune, I have dropped the idea of a commune too.\nHere, now only individuals are living together. Nobody here is expected to be a\npermanent resident; whenever he feels, he can be here and whenever he feels, he can move. We are trying to give every misfit all the space that is possible. One of my sannyasins -- Veeresh, in Europe\n-- is creating \"Rajneesh Misfit Cities.\"\nI think you have carried the idea from the American commune. It must have been difficult for you there, because whenever thousands of people live together, they have to follow certain rules. Otherwise it will become impossible to live.\nHere there is no permanent residentship. As long as you feel good, you can be here. The moment you feel uncomfortable, the whole world is available to you; wherever you want, you can go and be comfortable. But I want to remind you: if you cannot feel comfortable here, you cannot feel comfortable anywhere else either.\nI will read your question. \"As another of your communes takes off the ground...\" That is not right. No commune is taking off the ground. I have tried hard and found it impossible... if the commune has to exist, the individual has to compromise. That's absolutely natural and necessary. And I am so much in favor of the misfit people, that rather than dropping the misfits, I have dropped the idea of the commune itself. Now there are only misfit people here.\nThe misfit people obviously understand each other's needs. The need is just to be yourself, and doing your own thing. That's why we are not developing any kind of productive activity here. Neither roads have to be made, nor houses have to be made. Because if you have to make roads and you have to make houses and you have to do farming, and you have to have milk products of your own, then naturally a certain organization becomes necessary.\nLeeladhar is a plastic surgeon. Here we are not going to have even a medical center. There was in the old days before the American commune happened, a medical center, but that needs organization.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 207\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nNow I want this place just to be a paradise -- a holiday resort where you can relax, have a massage... soon there will be swimming pools, larger gardens and lawns. You can play on your instruments whenever you want, at whatever time you want. You can do your own thing.\nJust remember that your thing should not be an interference in somebody else's life structure, because he also wants to be independent, just as you do. That is the only agreement: that everybody is free to the limit that he does not interfere with anybody else. This much of a limit is absolutely necessary.\nJust think -- you are sleeping and few misfits come and start doing dynamic meditation in your room. They are doing their thing; they are not telling you to do the dynamic meditation.\nAnd by the time they have left, other misfits come and start playing on their musical instruments. Nobody is bothering you; you can go on sleeping or whatever you want to do!\n\"So this line has to be remembered...\nOtherwise there is no interference at all. Work I have dropped completely, unless you want to do it, unless it is your thing. In the commune, work was absolutely necessary to survive.\nHere, you come whenever you can manage financially, for as long as you can manage to live here, but there is no question of any work being imposed on you. You can choose if you want to do something or you simply want to rest, swim, do a few groups, meditate -- or not to do any group, not to do any meditation, just to be.\nYou are saying, \"I strongly develop symptoms of misfit.\" Again you are wrong: Leeladhar, you are a born misfit. It is not something that you are developing. I know you perfectly well.\nIt was I who was forcing you to remain in the hospital unit in the commune, in spite of yourself. Because I wanted you to remain in the unit, you remained -- but you are a misfit.\nThe misfit has to accept one thing: that he will not be respected by the ordinary society. He will not get recommendations and honors and awards for being a\nmisfit. I am certainly thinking to create an award, a world award each year, to be given to the greatest misfit in the world. And Leeladhar, your name is the first on my list.\nBut the discomfort is not coming from the outside, because outside I don't see that you are expected to do anything. You are feeling uncomfortable as an inner tension; you don't want to be a misfit, and you are. You have not accepted your misfitness with total love and joy.\nThere is nothing wrong in it; the society needs a few misfit people. They are the people who carry the torch of freedom and consciousness from generation to generation.\nDo you think Gautam Buddha was not a misfit? Or Mahavira was not a misfit? The son of a king goes naked -- his father was ashamed, his family was ashamed. They were willing --\n\"You can renounce the world... but what is the need to go naked?\" But Mahavira never felt uncomfortable; he accepted himself as he was.\nThe misfitness does not come alone; it will bring disrespect from people. You have to accept it.\nThe society is made by the people who are square, absolutely fit people. Any misfit is a disturbance. That society creates in every child the idea: never be a misfit, otherwise you will be dishonored, disrespected, rejected. And those ideas are still in your mind. Misfitness is your nature, and the discomfort is arising because the ideas that society gives to everybody, it has given to you too. You are not together; there is a split. Deep down you don't want to be a misfit.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 208\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nI would like to suggest, drop those ideas. All respectability, all honor is meaningless if it drives you against your nature. What can you do if you are not a lotus flower, but just a marigold? Enjoy being a marigold.\nExistence has no disrespect for misfit people. The sun makes no difference, the moon does not discriminate; the whole existence accepts you as you are. But deep down within you there is a rejection, so you are in a split, in a dilemma. With this dilemma, wherever you go you will feel uncomfortable -- more uncomfortable than you are feeling here, because here nobody is interested in condemning, in judging. Nobody will say, \"Leeladhar, you are not what you should be.\" There is no \"should\" here.\nIn the American commune, you were not willing to remain a plastic surgeon. Now is the chance -- nobody is telling you to be a plastic surgeon; even if you want to be, nobody is interested in plastic surgery here. If somebody's nose is a little long, nobody objects. Or a little smaller... a nose is just functional. With the long nose or the small nose, if breathing is going well, there is no problem. Here nobody is interested in changing from a man into a woman, or from woman into a man.\nThis is not a commune, this is simply a gathering of all kinds of misfit people who cannot fit anywhere else. Here they can celebrate their misfitness without losing respect and honor and dignity.\nYou say, \"India, and even a commune, just does not seem to be the place where I feel comfortable.\"\nIndia is the oldest country which has allowed all kinds of misfit people. It is unbelievable that Indian society down the ages has never crucified a Jesus and there have been many who were claiming \"Ambram Hasmi\" \"I am a god\" -- Jesus was only saying \"I am the only begotten son of God\" -- and nobody has objected. If they are enjoying and feeling blissful, they are not doing any harm to anybody.\nGautam Buddha did not believe in God. Mahavira absolutely rejected the very idea of God. But they were not crucified, they were loved as they were.\nAnd even before them, a long passage of ten thousand years... you will find all kinds of people. Somebody is standing on his head; nobody even takes any note of it, nobody says that you are mad or something. Somebody has been standing for years, has been sleeping standing, with the support of a wooden structure; -- he is keeping his hands on the structure and fast asleep -- and people always give the freedom: if he decides to be this way, this is his business.\nIt is between him and God; who we are to interfere?\nI have seen a man who has been standing for so many years that the upper side of his body has become thin, and all the blood has gone into the legs. In medical science it is called elephantiasis; it is a certain disease. Now even if he wants to sit, he cannot sit. Those legs are so thick, and they have lost the quality of elasticity; they have become almost solid. But nobody condemns him. On the contrary, people bring sweets to him, somebody brings flowers to him... poor fellow is doing something great, suffering too much, unnecessarily. But if it is natural to him, then it is perfectly okay.\nNo Socrates was ever poisoned in India, and India has known more Socrates' than any other country -- thousands of them, of the same caliber, with the same logic; sometimes even a more subtle logic, very destructive to people's prejudices. But people have enjoyed them.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 209\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nWhether you agree with them or not, that's one thing, but you have to appreciate their sharpness, their intelligence.\nI am reminded of Ramakrishna. He was uneducated, and you will not find another misfit like him. Yet this country has accepted him as one of the incarnations of God.\nWhen he was nine years old he had an experience of deep meditation. He was not looking for it. He was just a boy coming back from the field to his home, and just on the way there was a lake, a beautiful lake. It was sunset time and there were black clouds in the sky. The rains were just to come. And as he came by the side of the lake, a line of white cranes, who must have been sitting on the bank of the lake, were disturbed by his coming. They flew across the black clouds.\nThe white crane is snow white, and twelve or fifteen cranes in a line, moving across the black clouds... and the sunset on the lake, spreading gold all over. The beauty of the moment was such that Ramakrishna could not contain it; he fell into unconsciousness. It was too much for his conscious mind, just to say that \"It\nis beautiful\" and go home.\nWhen he was not home, people went in search. His father said, \"He left the field before me.\" They looked around the lake and they found him unconscious -- but with such a joy on his face. When he came back to consciousness, the first words he said were, \"I have known life for the first time. Up to now I have been unconscious; these few hours I was CONSCIOUS.\"\nThe parents became afraid -- any parents would have become afraid -- that this boy was showing symptoms which could lead him to becoming a sannyasin, a seeker. And for centuries parents have thought, and thought rightly, that it would be good to arrange a marriage. The woman will put him right.\nThey were afraid: perhaps he will say no. But when his father asked, \"Would you like to be married?\" he said, \"Great! I have seen many marriages in town; it is such a joy, riding on the horse like a king.\"\nThe father thought, \"He does not understand what marriage is, he has simply seen the marriage processions. But it is good he is ready.\"\nSo they found a beautiful girl in a nearby place, and when he was going there -- it was summertime -- to see the girl, his mother put three rupees in his pocket, she told him, \"If you need, you use them, but there is no need to waste them. We are poor people.\"\nAnd this is the way in India, which still persists over almost ninety percent of India: you can see the girl only as a glimpse. She will come and serve tea -- and that is the moment when you see her for few seconds -- and she is gone.\nSharda, who was going to become his wife, came to put some sweets in his plate when they were taking their breakfast. He said to his father, \"My god, the girl is so beautiful!\" He took out the three rupees and put them at her feet, and touched her feet and said, \"Mother, you are one in millions. I am going to marry you.\"\nThe father said, \"Idiot! First you call her 'mother,' touch her feet... and you have put your offering also, three rupees. And you are going to marry her?\"\nEven the girl's parents became a little afraid, because this boy seems to be a little crazy.\nBut Ramakrishna said, \"I don't see any problem in it. She is so beautiful, that's why I touched her feet. Beauty should be respected. And she is so motherly; you can see it even from her Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n210\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nface. That's why I called her 'mother'. Every girl is going to be a mother, so why you are freaking out? And I have decided that if I am going to marry anyone, this girl is the one; otherwise I will remain unmarried.\"\nBoth the families managed, convinced each other that he is not mad or anything, just a little off, land a little eccentric, but he is not harmful. He does things which should not be done, but he never harms anybody.\nThey were married and the first night Ramakrishna said to Sharda, \"It is private, don't say it to anybody; I have accepted you as my mother. Let the whole world think you are my wife. I know you are my mother, you know I am your son. And this is going to be our relationship.\"\nAnd this remained their relationship their whole life. But rather than being criticized he is being respected for this strange relationship. His wife is his mother, and there was never any husband and wife relationship between them.\nThere are so many stories of unfitness... One sudra queen -- she was a queen, but by the Hindu caste system she was the lowest untouchable -- made a very beautiful temple on the banks of Ganges near Calcutta, in Dakshineshwar. No brahmin was ready to be a priest in her temple. The temple made by a sudra, by an untouchable, had also become untouchable; and the god inside had also become untouchable. In the whole of Bengal, only Ramakrishna, when he heard it, said, \"This is a perfectly good chance.\" He went to the queen and said, \"I am ready to be the priest\" -- and he was a high caste brahmin.\nShe said, \"Have you thought about it? Your society may discard you, expel you.\"\nHe said, \"I don't have any society. And what does it matter if they expel me, if they make me an outcast? I am not dependent on anyone. I am going to be the priest in this temple.\" And he was expelled, condemned.\nPeople tried to persuade him, \"If you leave this job we can give you a better job in a high-caste Hindu temple. You will get more money.\" But he said, \"It is not a question of money. I love the temple, I love the place, I love the silence surrounding it, the trees... and I love the goddess inside the temple.\"\nHe was expelled, but he never cared about it. Even his family stopped visiting him --\nbecause they would be expelled -- and they told him that he could not come back home. He said, \"It is perfectly okay.\"\nAnd his worshiping was so strange: sometimes he would worship from morning till evening, dancing and singing madly. People would come and go, and sometimes he would lock the temple and would not open it for a few days. It was reported to Rashmani, the queen:\n\"What kind of priest have you found? Every priest worships for half an hour at the most. This man seems to be mad: when he worships, then time stops; then he goes on dancing and singing from morning till evening. And sometimes, which is absolutely sacrilegious, he locks the temple. Neither does he worship, nor does he allow anybody else to enter!\"\nThe queen called him and said, \"Ramakrishna, what kind of worship is this?\"\nHe said, \"Who says it is worship? It is a love affair. And in a love affair it is natural: sometimes I get angry, sometimes she gets angry.\" He is talking about the goddess of the temple. \"And when I get angry I lock the door and I say, 'Now live for three days, four days, without food, without worship, and you will come to your senses.'\"\nRashmani said, \"But we have never heard of this kind of worship!\" Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n211\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nRamakrishna said, \"There has never been a priest like Ramakrishna.\"\nIn the temples, when priests worship, the food is presented to the god or the goddess and then it is distributed. And Ramakrishna would spoil it completely. First he would taste everything inside the temple. Before offering it to the goddess, he would taste everything, and then he will offer it. Again he was called: \"You are doing something very wrong. It has never been done.\"\nHe said, \"I am not concerned whether it has been done or not. I know only one thing: my mother used to taste everything, and then she would give it to me. If it was really delicious, she would give; if it was not she would prepare it again. And if my mother can do that for me... I cannot give anything to the goddess without knowing whether it is worth eating or not.\"\nRashmani must have been a very intelligent woman to tolerate this misfit man. Instead of condemning him, people started coming to pay respect to him. His love for the goddess was so genuine, although it was not ritualistic. And anything genuine cannot be a ritual.\nOne of the great logicians of Bengal, Keshav Chandra, heard about thousands of people going to Ramakrishna. He was an atheist and a great philosopher, and a very sharp logician.\nHe challenged Ramakrishna: \"I am coming on a certain day to discuss matters with you.\"\nAll the followers of Ramakrishna were very much afraid, afraid because they knew that Ramakrishna knows nothing, no scripture; he makes his own songs that he sings in the temple. He is uneducated, he has never heard anything about logic, philosophy. It is not a question of mind to him.\nThey were afraid: \"It will be very embarrassing to us all, because Keshav Chandra can defeat Ramakrishna within seconds.\"\nAnd Keshav Chandra came with his own disciples. He had his own society, and he was a very egoistic man. Ramakrishna jumped up from where he was sitting under a tree, hugged Keshav Chandra, and said, \"I am feeling so happy that you also have come to me.\"\nKeshav Chandra said, \"I have come here to defeat you.\"\nRamakrishna said, \"It does not matter whether you defeat me or I defeat you.\nFrom this moment our love will remain. You start defeating -- I am ready.\"\nKeshav Chandra said, \"Start defeating? First you have to propose your philosophy.\"\nRamakrishna said, \"I don't know anything about philosophy. You will have to do both things yourself -- propose my philosophy and defeat it.\"\nInstead of Ramakrishna looking embarrassed, Keshav Chandra started looking embarrassed -- where have I come? But something had to be done, so he said, \"Okay, do you believe in God?\"\nSo Ramakrishna said, \"Believe? I know him. Why should I believe? Only ignorant people believe.\" Now what to do with this man? A belief can be criticized, but the man says he knows!\nStill, Keshav Chandra made great arguments against God; he said \"It is all hallucination, illusion, imagination, that you think you know God.\" And each time he would make a good argument Ramakrishna would stand up and hug him again and say, \"You are so beautiful, Keshav Chandra; I love the way you talk, although it does not change anything. In fact, your Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n212\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nintelligence is a proof to me that God exists, because your intelligence is derived from existence. It cannot come from nowhere, and all that we mean by God is that the universe is intelligent. I am a poor fellow, uneducated. I am not a proof for God, but you are.\"\nThe authority and the authenticity and the sincerity... for the first time in his life, Keshav Chandra felt defeated, although the man has not argued. He touched the feet of Ramakrishna and said, \"Accept me also as your disciple. Seeing you, seeing your behavior, seeing your joy, is enough to prove that dry arguments are not going to transform me. But you are a transformed man. Most probably you are right and I am wrong. I can prove myself right -- but to prove oneself right is one thing, and to be right is another thing. Your presence is the argument.\"\nThis country has accepted and loved all kinds of unfit people, and if you feel that\nIndia is making you uncomfortable, you have to be here a little longer to feel the atmosphere.\nI have been around the world. No country has such a groovy atmosphere. They are scientifically developed, technologically very progressive. They are rich, they are educated.\nThis country is poor, hungry, with no science, no technology. But this country has a certain vibe which has been created by thousands of mystics.\nYou need to be here, Leeladhar, for a little longer, so that you can start feeling the subtle vibe.\nMy experience is... in America we created the commune, but in the American atmosphere the commune was, as a whole, out of place. There was no supporting nourishment as far as atmosphere is concerned. And then I moved around the world. I have been talking in every country, and the strangest fact is that I was talking with my own sannyasins, with whom I talk here, but something was missing. I was there, my people were there, but in the air, something was missing.\nBack to India, the same people... but nothing is missing. A subtle juice surrounds, a certain noosphere, a very deep and ancient flavor of mysticism, an inner richness. Communication is easier.\nTo adapt to the Indian atmosphere it takes a little time, and perhaps that also is making you uncomfortable. It is just as if you are coming from a desert into a garden. It will take a little time to feel the greenness, to feel the fragrance of the flowers. The contrast is so big.\nAnd you have been brought up in the West. Your whole make-up is that of a scientist, and this country knows nothing of science. This is the most unscientific country in the world. But it is the most religious, mystic, heartful land. It has its own juice. Give it a chance.\nCertainly you are not a bigger misfit than I am.\nIn India I feel at ease. The Western tension is not there; neither is the Western speed. I am reminded when, for the first time, the British Empire was laying rails for railway trains.\nA British officer was looking at an Indian sannyasin who used to come every day, sit under a tree or lie down under a tree, and watch the people working, putting down the rails, making the arrangements. He had never seen such a lazy man: he never did anything, he just rested there.\nOne day the officer approached him. He had learned a little bit of Hindi because of working with Indian workers, laborers, for years. So he asked the man, \"You come every day.\nBefore we come you are here, and when we go, then you go. Why are you wasting time just Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n213\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nlying down under the tree, lazy? You can earn money, you can become a laborer. We are in shortage of laborers. I can give you a good job.\"\nThe man was not even bothering to sit up. He was lying down and talking with the officer.\nHe said, \"The idea is good, but I don't need money. I get food two times a day. My other brothers work on the farm. I have been always this way. And even if I earn money, what I am going to do with it?\"\nThe officer said, \"When you earn enough money, then you can retire and rest.\" And the man said, \"This is strange, I am already retired, and I am resting! Why take this unnecessarily long route? First earn money, then get retired, then rest -- I am retired from the very beginning. And I am resting; I don't do anything except rest.\"\nThere is no speed in the Indian atmosphere. Things move very slowly. You cannot even see the movement, they move so slowly. Centuries pass...\nIf a man in Europe wakes up from his grave after two thousand years, he will not be able to understand what is happening, because in two thousand years the West has changed so much. But if an Indian comes to visit India after two thousand years, he will be perfectly at home. Almost nothing has changed!\nLeeladhar, your discomfort is coming from your own conditioning, one thing. Second, you have not accepted your unfitness in its totality; otherwise why should one be uncomfortable?\nAnd you can be free to do anything you want, anywhere. For example, I have not been uncomfortable anywhere around the world. I was not uncomfortable in the American jails. I was not uncomfortable in different cultures, different countries, different religions. I accept my unfitness with absolute joy.\nThe first three days in the American jail and the sheriff of the jail came to see me. He wondered what kind of man I am, because the inmates had become my disciples! I was talking to them about meditation. The nurses and the doctor -- because I was in the hospital section --\nhad also joined. Finally, the sheriff brought his wife and his children also: \"We may not be able to see this man again, and what he is saying makes sense.\"\nAnd the doctor -- a woman, very beautiful woman -- used to come to the hospital section only one time in seven days; otherwise she was engaged in other parts of the jail. It has seven hundred inmates. But for those three days, all the nurses were there, the doctor was there, the whole staff was there. The doctor said to me, \"It has never happened. You have turned my office into your class! Otherwise my office is always empty.\"\nBecause my cell was very small... it was meant only for two persons. And there were twelve inmates in the hospital section. They all wanted to be with me as much as possible --\nsix nurses, four staff people, the sheriff, the assistant sheriff, the doctor -- so they moved me to the doctor's room. And she told me, \"You need not use the bathroom that is meant for the prisoners. My bathroom is for you as long as you are here.\"\nNirupa is here, David is here. They were staying in town to take care of me, to bring new clothes, or anything I needed. The sheriff told me in front of them, \"I would like to come to see your commune where such silent, beautiful young people -- intelligent, loving -- are living with you and growing with you.\"\nHe said to me, \"Just David and Nirupa are enough proof that man can be transformed.\"\nOtherwise, American kids -- even the primary school kids -- are taking drugs... thirteen and Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n214\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nfourteen year-old young boys have been found committing murders, rape, suicide. That is the American atmosphere.\nThe jails are so full that the magistrate has to think before he sends another prisoner to the jail, because some old prisoner has to be released. The jails are packed. You can bring a new prisoner, but you have to release an old prisoner.\nMy attorneys who used to come there -- Niren was my chief attorney; he is here\n-- they could not believe I was looking so happy and so at ease and at home. I said, \"I have never been able to rest so much. The inmates are taking care, the nurses are taking care, the doctor is taking care. And they are all interested in only one thing: the moment I am released and I go back to the commune, they all want to stay in the commune for a few days.\"\nThe first day, the sheriff received a phone call from Germany asking about me, and saying that \"You must be surprised, because this may be the first time that you have a man like Osho in your jail.\" He was not acquainted with me. He said, \"No, but we have had cabinet ministers, great politicians, so it is not new to us.\"\nBut on the third day he came with tears in his eyes when I was leaving and he said, \"I don't know who has phoned, but I want to apologize, because I gave him the wrong answer. In these three days so many flowers have come that we don't have any space to keep them; so many telegrams, so many phone calls that we have to keep two extra phone receivers.\n\"If you find the man just ask him for me, to forgive me. The great politicians and cabinet ministers don't matter. I never in my whole life had a prisoner like you -- and I don't think I ever will have, in my remaining years in the service -- for the simple reason that you have changed the whole atmosphere of my jail.\n\"If you are allowed to be here for three or four months this will be your commune. You are really dangerous because all the people of my staff are coming with their wives and with their children to have a photograph taken with\nyou.\"\nThe poor prisoners could not manage. They were coming with photographs cut from newspapers just to get my signature: \"We will remember our whole lives that for three days we were with you, and in three days we have felt a change.\" People were not making noise.\nEverybody was saying, \"Don't make noise, he will be disturbed.\" I have never felt uncomfortable anywhere.\nThe question, basically is to accept yourself. It is a inner feeling, nothing to do with anything outside you. And I repeat: if you cannot feel comfortable here, Leeladhar, you will not find another place in the whole earth to be comfortable. Nowhere else is the uniqueness of individual respected; nowhere else are you loved as you are. You have to prove, you have to deserve.\nHere you don't have to prove anything, and you don't have to deserve anything. You don't have to be worthy of anything. This is the way you are and everybody is in a tremendous, accepting, awareness. Just give it a little time.\n\"Is there such a state as doing your own thing, content and full of gratitude?\"\nYes. That's my whole approach towards life: \"doing your own thing content and full of gratitude...\" It is not an ego trip. It is your nature wanting to be left undisturbed.\nAnd here we are not engaged in any kind of work which has to be forced on you. This place has to leave in you a memory of sheer enjoyment, of silence and beauty. And people Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n215\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nwho are non-interfering with you, are happy in your happiness. Nobody is jealous, nobody is competitive. Nobody is even comparing.\nBut it all depends on you.\nI have created the space here. Now how you use it, is up to you.\nDuring the second world war, at the Russian front, an Italian and a German general are preparing an attack. When all the preparations are ready, and the attack is ready to be launched, the German general calls his servant: \"Heinz, bring me my red coat.\"\n\"What, a red coat?\" says the Italian general surprised. \"How come?\"\n\"Well, during the battle I may be hurt; blood may be flowing, and my soldiers, seeing blood, might get demoralized. So I always wear a red coat during battle.\"\n\"What a great idea,\" says the Italian general and calls his servant. \"Giuseppe, quick, bring my brown trousers!\"\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI BLEW IT TODAY. ONE MOMENT OF UNAWARENESS FEELS LIKE IT WIPES\nOUT THOSE MOMENTS OF AWARENESS. WHILE PRUNING IN YOUR GARDEN I CUT DEEPLY INTO A LIVING TREE THAT I THOUGHT WAS DEAD. THE VERY\nMOMENT THE AXE MADE ITS DEATH BLOW I KNEW, YOU KNEW, EXISTENCE\nKNEW, I HAD TAKEN LIFE. FEELING GUILT, FEAR, STUPIDITY, I FINISHED\nCUTTING THE TREE, CARRYING IT OUT OF YOUR GARDEN. OSHO, I HAVE CUT\nTHOUSANDS OF TREES AND KILLED MANY, MANY ANIMALS IN MY LIFE, BUT\nNEVER BEFORE FELT HURT AS MUCH AS I DID, AND DO, ABOUT THIS TREE.\nMUKTA IS AFRAID YOU'LL CUT OFF HER HEAD. SPARE HER HEAD AND CUT\nMINE, ALONG WITH MY UNAWARENESS. I'M SORRY.\nAnand Vibhavan, it is something tremendously beautiful that reverence for life is arising in you. But don't feel any guilt, neither fear nor stupidity, because these are parasites. Just do one thing: become more alert and remember: before you cut another tree, make sure that it is dead.\nThere is no hurry. It is simply unconsciousness; otherwise you would have found that it was alive. Perhaps the leaves had fallen and the tree was waiting for new leaves to come. And you could have waited and watched... but guilt is not the right thing.\nYou hurt the tree; now you are hurting yourself.\nReverence for life does not mean reverence only for others' life. It also includes reverence for your own life too.\nGuilt is not reverence. Neither you are stupid -- because you became aware; not only aware, but you felt hurt that a life is unnecessarily destroyed. It shows intelligence.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 216\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nAnd as far as fear is concerned, don't be worried about Mukta. I have chopped her head long ago -- she believes she has a head -- and I will chop your head too.\nBut my surgery is not painful. It brings more blissfulness to you than you had ever experienced. So there is no need to have fear. Just have awareness, more alertness, more consciousness.\nThis garden is not just an ordinary garden. These trees have heard me as much as you have heard me, and these trees have loved me as much as you have loved me. These trees are as much my disciples as you are. So be respectful with them. With loving care, with sensitive alertness, you will not only be a good gardener, you will also become a higher consciousness\n-- more human, more divine.\nShower on these trees all your love. They cannot speak, but they are very sensitive.\nThe latest experiments about trees are so revealing -- they can even read your thoughts.\nTheir sensitivity is far greater than man's sensitivity.\nScientists have developed certain instruments like the cardiogram. They put the cardiogram on a certain tree and the cardiogram starts making a graph of how the tree is feeling. The graph is symmetrical, and then suddenly they bring a woodcutter with an axe, and the moment the tree sees the woodcutter the graph changes. It goes berserk, the symmetry is lost. Nothing has been done to the tree, it is just that the woodcutter has come with the idea to cut it. That idea is being caught by the sensitiveness of the tree, and now, there are scientific ways to find it out.\nThe strangest thing is that if the woodcutter is just passing without any idea of cutting the tree, the graph does not change. It depends on his idea -- his thought creates a certain wave.\nEvery thought is being broadcasted from your mind, creating waves around you, and those waves are picked up by the sensitiveness of the tree. They are very much alive.\nIt is good that you have become aware of it. Don't lose this awareness, because it will not only help the trees, it will help you too. It will become your meditation.\nEverything that is being done here has to become your meditation.\nThis is a temple, and we are here just for a single reason: to transcend our darkness and our unconsciousness.\nA man goes into a men's toilet, holding his hands outstretched, as if they are paralyzed. In the urinals, he taps another man on the elbow.\n\"Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me. I have a problem with my hands and need assistance in using the urinal. Would you be so kind as to open my zipper?\"\nThe other man is very embarrassed, but obliges. The first man says, \"Thank you very much. Now I have another favor to ask. Would you mind helping me to aim?\"\nThe second man blushes, but helps him aim. After he has relieved himself, the first man says, \"You don't know how grateful I am. Now please just do me up again.\" Nearly at the end of his patience, the second man does so.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 217\nChapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world\nThe first man turns to leave, and looking at his awkwardly-held hands, says, \"Good. I think my nail polish is dry now.\"\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 218\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6987","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/part96/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/>The Hidden Splendor</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 20 - Your longing is the seed</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6987 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Hidden_Splendor/part96.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part95>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

INDIA, AND EVEN A COMMUNE, JUST
DOES</p><p>NOT SEEM TO BE THE PLACE WHERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE. IS THERE SUCH A
STATE AS "DOING YOUR OWN THING, CONTENT AND FULL OF GRATITUDE"</p><p>THAT IS NOT JUST AN EGO TRIP?</p><p>Prem Leeladhar, I myself am an unfit. And this place here has gone
far beyond being a commune. The commune was an alternative society. But
it has its own organization, its own rules, regulations. Seeing that for
misfits it will be difficult to be part of even a commune, I have
dropped the idea of a commune too.</p><p>Here, now only individuals are living together. Nobody here is
expected to be a</p><p>permanent resident; whenever he feels, he can be here and whenever he
feels, he can move. We are trying to give every misfit all the space
that is possible. One of my sannyasins -- Veeresh, in Europe</p><p>-- is creating "Rajneesh Misfit Cities."</p><p>I think you have carried the idea from the American commune. It must
have been difficult for you there, because whenever thousands of people
live together, they have to follow certain rules. Otherwise it will
become impossible to live.</p><p>Here there is no permanent residentship. As long as you feel good,
you can be here. The moment you feel uncomfortable, the whole world is
available to you; wherever you want, you can go and be comfortable. But
I want to remind you: if you cannot feel comfortable here, you cannot
feel comfortable anywhere else either.</p><p>I will read your question. "As another of your communes takes off the
ground..." That is not right. No commune is taking off the ground. I
have tried hard and found it impossible... if the commune has to exist,
the individual has to compromise. That's absolutely natural and
necessary. And I am so much in favor of the misfit people, that rather
than dropping the misfits, I have dropped the idea of the commune
itself. Now there are only misfit people here.</p><p>The misfit people obviously understand each other's needs. The need
is just to be yourself, and doing your own thing. That's why we are not
developing any kind of productive activity here. Neither roads have to
be made, nor houses have to be made. Because if you have to make roads
and you have to make houses and you have to do farming, and you have to
have milk products of your own, then naturally a certain organization
becomes necessary.</p><p>Leeladhar is a plastic surgeon. Here we are not going to have even a
medical center. There was in the old days before the American commune
happened, a medical center, but that needs organization.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 207</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>Now I want this place just to be a paradise -- a holiday resort where
you can relax, have a massage... soon there will be swimming pools,
larger gardens and lawns. You can play on your instruments whenever you
want, at whatever time you want. You can do your own thing.</p><p>Just remember that your thing should not be an interference in
somebody else's life structure, because he also wants to be independent,
just as you do. That is the only agreement: that everybody is free to
the limit that he does not interfere with anybody else. This much of a
limit is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Just think -- you are sleeping and few misfits come and start doing
dynamic meditation in your room. They are doing their thing; they are
not telling you to do the dynamic meditation.</p><p>And by the time they have left, other misfits come and start playing
on their musical instruments. Nobody is bothering you; you can go on
sleeping or whatever you want to do!</p><p>"So this line has to be remembered...</p><p>Otherwise there is no interference at all. Work I have dropped
completely, unless you want to do it, unless it is your thing. In the
commune, work was absolutely necessary to survive.</p><p>Here, you come whenever you can manage financially, for as long as
you can manage to live here, but there is no question of any work being
imposed on you. You can choose if you want to do something or you simply
want to rest, swim, do a few groups, meditate -- or not to do any group,
not to do any meditation, just to be.</p><p>You are saying, "I strongly develop symptoms of misfit." Again you
are wrong: Leeladhar, you are a born misfit. It is not something that
you are developing. I know you perfectly well.</p><p>It was I who was forcing you to remain in the hospital unit in the
commune, in spite of yourself. Because I wanted you to remain in the
unit, you remained -- but you are a misfit.</p><p>The misfit has to accept one thing: that he will not be respected by
the ordinary society. He will not get recommendations and honors and
awards for being a</p><p>misfit. I am certainly thinking to create an award, a world award
each year, to be given to the greatest misfit in the world. And
Leeladhar, your name is the first on my list.</p><p>But the discomfort is not coming from the outside, because outside I
don't see that you are expected to do anything. You are feeling
uncomfortable as an inner tension; you don't want to be a misfit, and
you are. You have not accepted your misfitness with total love and
joy.</p><p>There is nothing wrong in it; the society needs a few misfit people.
They are the people who carry the torch of freedom and consciousness
from generation to generation.</p><p>Do you think Gautam Buddha was not a misfit? Or Mahavira was not a
misfit? The son of a king goes naked -- his father was ashamed, his
family was ashamed. They were willing --</p><p>"You can renounce the world... but what is the need to go naked?" But
Mahavira never felt uncomfortable; he accepted himself as he was.</p><p>The misfitness does not come alone; it will bring disrespect from
people. You have to accept it.</p><p>The society is made by the people who are square, absolutely fit
people. Any misfit is a disturbance. That society creates in every child
the idea: never be a misfit, otherwise you will be dishonored,
disrespected, rejected. And those ideas are still in your mind.
Misfitness is your nature, and the discomfort is arising because the
ideas that society gives to everybody, it has given to you too. You are
not together; there is a split. Deep down you don't want to be a
misfit.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 208</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>I would like to suggest, drop those ideas. All respectability, all
honor is meaningless if it drives you against your nature. What can you
do if you are not a lotus flower, but just a marigold? Enjoy being a
marigold.</p><p>Existence has no disrespect for misfit people. The sun makes no
difference, the moon does not discriminate; the whole existence accepts
you as you are. But deep down within you there is a rejection, so you
are in a split, in a dilemma. With this dilemma, wherever you go you
will feel uncomfortable -- more uncomfortable than you are feeling here,
because here nobody is interested in condemning, in judging. Nobody will
say, "Leeladhar, you are not what you should be." There is no "should"
here.</p><p>In the American commune, you were not willing to remain a plastic
surgeon. Now is the chance -- nobody is telling you to be a plastic
surgeon; even if you want to be, nobody is interested in plastic surgery
here. If somebody's nose is a little long, nobody objects. Or a little
smaller... a nose is just functional. With the long nose or the small
nose, if breathing is going well, there is no problem. Here nobody is
interested in changing from a man into a woman, or from woman into a
man.</p><p>This is not a commune, this is simply a gathering of all kinds of
misfit people who cannot fit anywhere else. Here they can celebrate
their misfitness without losing respect and honor and dignity.</p><p>You say, "India, and even a commune, just does not seem to be the
place where I feel comfortable."</p><p>India is the oldest country which has allowed all kinds of misfit
people. It is unbelievable that Indian society down the ages has never
crucified a Jesus and there have been many who were claiming "Ambram
Hasmi" "I am a god" -- Jesus was only saying "I am the only begotten son
of God" -- and nobody has objected. If they are enjoying and feeling
blissful, they are not doing any harm to anybody.</p><p>Gautam Buddha did not believe in God. Mahavira absolutely rejected
the very idea of God. But they were not crucified, they were loved as
they were.</p><p>And even before them, a long passage of ten thousand years... you
will find all kinds of people. Somebody is standing on his head; nobody
even takes any note of it, nobody says that you are mad or something.
Somebody has been standing for years, has been sleeping standing, with
the support of a wooden structure; -- he is keeping his hands on the
structure and fast asleep -- and people always give the freedom: if he
decides to be this way, this is his business.</p><p>It is between him and God; who we are to interfere?</p><p>I have seen a man who has been standing for so many years that the
upper side of his body has become thin, and all the blood has gone into
the legs. In medical science it is called elephantiasis; it is a certain
disease. Now even if he wants to sit, he cannot sit. Those legs are so
thick, and they have lost the quality of elasticity; they have become
almost solid. But nobody condemns him. On the contrary, people bring
sweets to him, somebody brings flowers to him... poor fellow is doing
something great, suffering too much, unnecessarily. But if it is natural
to him, then it is perfectly okay.</p><p>No Socrates was ever poisoned in India, and India has known more
Socrates' than any other country -- thousands of them, of the same
caliber, with the same logic; sometimes even a more subtle logic, very
destructive to people's prejudices. But people have enjoyed them.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 209</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>Whether you agree with them or not, that's one thing, but you have to
appreciate their sharpness, their intelligence.</p><p>I am reminded of Ramakrishna. He was uneducated, and you will not
find another misfit like him. Yet this country has accepted him as one
of the incarnations of God.</p><p>When he was nine years old he had an experience of deep meditation.
He was not looking for it. He was just a boy coming back from the field
to his home, and just on the way there was a lake, a beautiful lake. It
was sunset time and there were black clouds in the sky. The rains were
just to come. And as he came by the side of the lake, a line of white
cranes, who must have been sitting on the bank of the lake, were
disturbed by his coming. They flew across the black clouds.</p><p>The white crane is snow white, and twelve or fifteen cranes in a
line, moving across the black clouds... and the sunset on the lake,
spreading gold all over. The beauty of the moment was such that
Ramakrishna could not contain it; he fell into unconsciousness. It was
too much for his conscious mind, just to say that "It</p><p>is beautiful" and go home.</p><p>When he was not home, people went in search. His father said, "He
left the field before me." They looked around the lake and they found
him unconscious -- but with such a joy on his face. When he came back to
consciousness, the first words he said were, "I have known life for the
first time. Up to now I have been unconscious; these few hours I was
CONSCIOUS."</p><p>The parents became afraid -- any parents would have become afraid --
that this boy was showing symptoms which could lead him to becoming a
sannyasin, a seeker. And for centuries parents have thought, and thought
rightly, that it would be good to arrange a marriage. The woman will put
him right.</p><p>They were afraid: perhaps he will say no. But when his father asked,
"Would you like to be married?" he said, "Great! I have seen many
marriages in town; it is such a joy, riding on the horse like a
king."</p><p>The father thought, "He does not understand what marriage is, he has
simply seen the marriage processions. But it is good he is ready."</p><p>So they found a beautiful girl in a nearby place, and when he was
going there -- it was summertime -- to see the girl, his mother put
three rupees in his pocket, she told him, "If you need, you use them,
but there is no need to waste them. We are poor people."</p><p>And this is the way in India, which still persists over almost ninety
percent of India: you can see the girl only as a glimpse. She will come
and serve tea -- and that is the moment when you see her for few seconds
-- and she is gone.</p><p>Sharda, who was going to become his wife, came to put some sweets in
his plate when they were taking their breakfast. He said to his father,
"My god, the girl is so beautiful!" He took out the three rupees and put
them at her feet, and touched her feet and said, "Mother, you are one in
millions. I am going to marry you."</p><p>The father said, "Idiot! First you call her 'mother,' touch her
feet... and you have put your offering also, three rupees. And you are
going to marry her?"</p><p>Even the girl's parents became a little afraid, because this boy
seems to be a little crazy.</p><p>But Ramakrishna said, "I don't see any problem in it. She is so
beautiful, that's why I touched her feet. Beauty should be respected.
And she is so motherly; you can see it even from her Osho - The Hidden
Splendor</p><p>210</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>face. That's why I called her 'mother'. Every girl is going to be a
mother, so why you are freaking out? And I have decided that if I am
going to marry anyone, this girl is the one; otherwise I will remain
unmarried."</p><p>Both the families managed, convinced each other that he is not mad or
anything, just a little off, land a little eccentric, but he is not
harmful. He does things which should not be done, but he never harms
anybody.</p><p>They were married and the first night Ramakrishna said to Sharda, "It
is private, don't say it to anybody; I have accepted you as my mother.
Let the whole world think you are my wife. I know you are my mother, you
know I am your son. And this is going to be our relationship."</p><p>And this remained their relationship their whole life. But rather
than being criticized he is being respected for this strange
relationship. His wife is his mother, and there was never any husband
and wife relationship between them.</p><p>There are so many stories of unfitness... One sudra queen -- she was
a queen, but by the Hindu caste system she was the lowest untouchable --
made a very beautiful temple on the banks of Ganges near Calcutta, in
Dakshineshwar. No brahmin was ready to be a priest in her temple. The
temple made by a sudra, by an untouchable, had also become untouchable;
and the god inside had also become untouchable. In the whole of Bengal,
only Ramakrishna, when he heard it, said, "This is a perfectly good
chance." He went to the queen and said, "I am ready to be the priest" --
and he was a high caste brahmin.</p><p>She said, "Have you thought about it? Your society may discard you,
expel you."</p><p>He said, "I don't have any society. And what does it matter if they
expel me, if they make me an outcast? I am not dependent on anyone. I am
going to be the priest in this temple." And he was expelled,
condemned.</p><p>People tried to persuade him, "If you leave this job we can give you
a better job in a high-caste Hindu temple. You will get more money." But
he said, "It is not a question of money. I love the temple, I love the
place, I love the silence surrounding it, the trees... and I love the
goddess inside the temple."</p><p>He was expelled, but he never cared about it. Even his family stopped
visiting him --</p><p>because they would be expelled -- and they told him that he could not
come back home. He said, "It is perfectly okay."</p><p>And his worshiping was so strange: sometimes he would worship from
morning till evening, dancing and singing madly. People would come and
go, and sometimes he would lock the temple and would not open it for a
few days. It was reported to Rashmani, the queen:</p><p>"What kind of priest have you found? Every priest worships for half
an hour at the most. This man seems to be mad: when he worships, then
time stops; then he goes on dancing and singing from morning till
evening. And sometimes, which is absolutely sacrilegious, he locks the
temple. Neither does he worship, nor does he allow anybody else to
enter!"</p><p>The queen called him and said, "Ramakrishna, what kind of worship is
this?"</p><p>He said, "Who says it is worship? It is a love affair. And in a love
affair it is natural: sometimes I get angry, sometimes she gets angry."
He is talking about the goddess of the temple. "And when I get angry I
lock the door and I say, 'Now live for three days, four days, without
food, without worship, and you will come to your senses.'"</p><p>Rashmani said, "But we have never heard of this kind of worship!"
Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>211</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "There has never been a priest like
Ramakrishna."</p><p>In the temples, when priests worship, the food is presented to the
god or the goddess and then it is distributed. And Ramakrishna would
spoil it completely. First he would taste everything inside the temple.
Before offering it to the goddess, he would taste everything, and then
he will offer it. Again he was called: "You are doing something very
wrong. It has never been done."</p><p>He said, "I am not concerned whether it has been done or not. I know
only one thing: my mother used to taste everything, and then she would
give it to me. If it was really delicious, she would give; if it was not
she would prepare it again. And if my mother can do that for me... I
cannot give anything to the goddess without knowing whether it is worth
eating or not."</p><p>Rashmani must have been a very intelligent woman to tolerate this
misfit man. Instead of condemning him, people started coming to pay
respect to him. His love for the goddess was so genuine, although it was
not ritualistic. And anything genuine cannot be a ritual.</p><p>One of the great logicians of Bengal, Keshav Chandra, heard about
thousands of people going to Ramakrishna. He was an atheist and a great
philosopher, and a very sharp logician.</p><p>He challenged Ramakrishna: "I am coming on a certain day to discuss
matters with you."</p><p>All the followers of Ramakrishna were very much afraid, afraid
because they knew that Ramakrishna knows nothing, no scripture; he makes
his own songs that he sings in the temple. He is uneducated, he has
never heard anything about logic, philosophy. It is not a question of
mind to him.</p><p>They were afraid: "It will be very embarrassing to us all, because
Keshav Chandra can defeat Ramakrishna within seconds."</p><p>And Keshav Chandra came with his own disciples. He had his own
society, and he was a very egoistic man. Ramakrishna jumped up from
where he was sitting under a tree, hugged Keshav Chandra, and said, "I
am feeling so happy that you also have come to me."</p><p>Keshav Chandra said, "I have come here to defeat you."</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "It does not matter whether you defeat me or I
defeat you.</p><p>From this moment our love will remain. You start defeating -- I am
ready."</p><p>Keshav Chandra said, "Start defeating? First you have to propose your
philosophy."</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "I don't know anything about philosophy. You will
have to do both things yourself -- propose my philosophy and defeat
it."</p><p>Instead of Ramakrishna looking embarrassed, Keshav Chandra started
looking embarrassed -- where have I come? But something had to be done,
so he said, "Okay, do you believe in God?"</p><p>So Ramakrishna said, "Believe? I know him. Why should I believe? Only
ignorant people believe." Now what to do with this man? A belief can be
criticized, but the man says he knows!</p><p>Still, Keshav Chandra made great arguments against God; he said "It
is all hallucination, illusion, imagination, that you think you know
God." And each time he would make a good argument Ramakrishna would
stand up and hug him again and say, "You are so beautiful, Keshav
Chandra; I love the way you talk, although it does not change anything.
In fact, your Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>212</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>intelligence is a proof to me that God exists, because your
intelligence is derived from existence. It cannot come from nowhere, and
all that we mean by God is that the universe is intelligent. I am a poor
fellow, uneducated. I am not a proof for God, but you are."</p><p>The authority and the authenticity and the sincerity... for the first
time in his life, Keshav Chandra felt defeated, although the man has not
argued. He touched the feet of Ramakrishna and said, "Accept me also as
your disciple. Seeing you, seeing your behavior, seeing your joy, is
enough to prove that dry arguments are not going to transform me. But
you are a transformed man. Most probably you are right and I am wrong. I
can prove myself right -- but to prove oneself right is one thing, and
to be right is another thing. Your presence is the argument."</p><p>This country has accepted and loved all kinds of unfit people, and if
you feel that</p><p>India is making you uncomfortable, you have to be here a little
longer to feel the atmosphere.</p><p>I have been around the world. No country has such a groovy
atmosphere. They are scientifically developed, technologically very
progressive. They are rich, they are educated.</p><p>This country is poor, hungry, with no science, no technology. But
this country has a certain vibe which has been created by thousands of
mystics.</p><p>You need to be here, Leeladhar, for a little longer, so that you can
start feeling the subtle vibe.</p><p>My experience is... in America we created the commune, but in the
American atmosphere the commune was, as a whole, out of place. There was
no supporting nourishment as far as atmosphere is concerned. And then I
moved around the world. I have been talking in every country, and the
strangest fact is that I was talking with my own sannyasins, with whom I
talk here, but something was missing. I was there, my people were there,
but in the air, something was missing.</p><p>Back to India, the same people... but nothing is missing. A subtle
juice surrounds, a certain noosphere, a very deep and ancient flavor of
mysticism, an inner richness. Communication is easier.</p><p>To adapt to the Indian atmosphere it takes a little time, and perhaps
that also is making you uncomfortable. It is just as if you are coming
from a desert into a garden. It will take a little time to feel the
greenness, to feel the fragrance of the flowers. The contrast is so
big.</p><p>And you have been brought up in the West. Your whole make-up is that
of a scientist, and this country knows nothing of science. This is the
most unscientific country in the world. But it is the most religious,
mystic, heartful land. It has its own juice. Give it a chance.</p><p>Certainly you are not a bigger misfit than I am.</p><p>In India I feel at ease. The Western tension is not there; neither is
the Western speed. I am reminded when, for the first time, the British
Empire was laying rails for railway trains.</p><p>A British officer was looking at an Indian sannyasin who used to come
every day, sit under a tree or lie down under a tree, and watch the
people working, putting down the rails, making the arrangements. He had
never seen such a lazy man: he never did anything, he just rested
there.</p><p>One day the officer approached him. He had learned a little bit of
Hindi because of working with Indian workers, laborers, for years. So he
asked the man, "You come every day.</p><p>Before we come you are here, and when we go, then you go. Why are you
wasting time just Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>213</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>lying down under the tree, lazy? You can earn money, you can become a
laborer. We are in shortage of laborers. I can give you a good job."</p><p>The man was not even bothering to sit up. He was lying down and
talking with the officer.</p><p>He said, "The idea is good, but I don't need money. I get food two
times a day. My other brothers work on the farm. I have been always this
way. And even if I earn money, what I am going to do with it?"</p><p>The officer said, "When you earn enough money, then you can retire
and rest." And the man said, "This is strange, I am already retired, and
I am resting! Why take this unnecessarily long route? First earn money,
then get retired, then rest -- I am retired from the very beginning. And
I am resting; I don't do anything except rest."</p><p>There is no speed in the Indian atmosphere. Things move very slowly.
You cannot even see the movement, they move so slowly. Centuries
pass...</p><p>If a man in Europe wakes up from his grave after two thousand years,
he will not be able to understand what is happening, because in two
thousand years the West has changed so much. But if an Indian comes to
visit India after two thousand years, he will be perfectly at home.
Almost nothing has changed!</p><p>Leeladhar, your discomfort is coming from your own conditioning, one
thing. Second, you have not accepted your unfitness in its totality;
otherwise why should one be uncomfortable?</p><p>And you can be free to do anything you want, anywhere. For example, I
have not been uncomfortable anywhere around the world. I was not
uncomfortable in the American jails. I was not uncomfortable in
different cultures, different countries, different religions. I accept
my unfitness with absolute joy.</p><p>The first three days in the American jail and the sheriff of the jail
came to see me. He wondered what kind of man I am, because the inmates
had become my disciples! I was talking to them about meditation. The
nurses and the doctor -- because I was in the hospital section --</p><p>had also joined. Finally, the sheriff brought his wife and his
children also: "We may not be able to see this man again, and what he is
saying makes sense."</p><p>And the doctor -- a woman, very beautiful woman -- used to come to
the hospital section only one time in seven days; otherwise she was
engaged in other parts of the jail. It has seven hundred inmates. But
for those three days, all the nurses were there, the doctor was there,
the whole staff was there. The doctor said to me, "It has never
happened. You have turned my office into your class! Otherwise my office
is always empty."</p><p>Because my cell was very small... it was meant only for two persons.
And there were twelve inmates in the hospital section. They all wanted
to be with me as much as possible --</p><p>six nurses, four staff people, the sheriff, the assistant sheriff,
the doctor -- so they moved me to the doctor's room. And she told me,
"You need not use the bathroom that is meant for the prisoners. My
bathroom is for you as long as you are here."</p><p>Nirupa is here, David is here. They were staying in town to take care
of me, to bring new clothes, or anything I needed. The sheriff told me
in front of them, "I would like to come to see your commune where such
silent, beautiful young people -- intelligent, loving -- are living with
you and growing with you."</p><p>He said to me, "Just David and Nirupa are enough proof that man can
be transformed."</p><p>Otherwise, American kids -- even the primary school kids -- are
taking drugs... thirteen and Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>214</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>fourteen year-old young boys have been found committing murders,
rape, suicide. That is the American atmosphere.</p><p>The jails are so full that the magistrate has to think before he
sends another prisoner to the jail, because some old prisoner has to be
released. The jails are packed. You can bring a new prisoner, but you
have to release an old prisoner.</p><p>My attorneys who used to come there -- Niren was my chief attorney;
he is here</p><p>-- they could not believe I was looking so happy and so at ease and
at home. I said, "I have never been able to rest so much. The inmates
are taking care, the nurses are taking care, the doctor is taking care.
And they are all interested in only one thing: the moment I am released
and I go back to the commune, they all want to stay in the commune for a
few days."</p><p>The first day, the sheriff received a phone call from Germany asking
about me, and saying that "You must be surprised, because this may be
the first time that you have a man like Osho in your jail." He was not
acquainted with me. He said, "No, but we have had cabinet ministers,
great politicians, so it is not new to us."</p><p>But on the third day he came with tears in his eyes when I was
leaving and he said, "I don't know who has phoned, but I want to
apologize, because I gave him the wrong answer. In these three days so
many flowers have come that we don't have any space to keep them; so
many telegrams, so many phone calls that we have to keep two extra phone
receivers.</p><p>"If you find the man just ask him for me, to forgive me. The great
politicians and cabinet ministers don't matter. I never in my whole life
had a prisoner like you -- and I don't think I ever will have, in my
remaining years in the service -- for the simple reason that you have
changed the whole atmosphere of my jail.</p><p>"If you are allowed to be here for three or four months this will be
your commune. You are really dangerous because all the people of my
staff are coming with their wives and with their children to have a
photograph taken with</p><p>you."</p><p>The poor prisoners could not manage. They were coming with
photographs cut from newspapers just to get my signature: "We will
remember our whole lives that for three days we were with you, and in
three days we have felt a change." People were not making noise.</p><p>Everybody was saying, "Don't make noise, he will be disturbed." I
have never felt uncomfortable anywhere.</p><p>The question, basically is to accept yourself. It is a inner feeling,
nothing to do with anything outside you. And I repeat: if you cannot
feel comfortable here, Leeladhar, you will not find another place in the
whole earth to be comfortable. Nowhere else is the uniqueness of
individual respected; nowhere else are you loved as you are. You have to
prove, you have to deserve.</p><p>Here you don't have to prove anything, and you don't have to deserve
anything. You don't have to be worthy of anything. This is the way you
are and everybody is in a tremendous, accepting, awareness. Just give it
a little time.</p><p>"Is there such a state as doing your own thing, content and full of
gratitude?"</p><p>Yes. That's my whole approach towards life: "doing your own thing
content and full of gratitude..." It is not an ego trip. It is your
nature wanting to be left undisturbed.</p><p>And here we are not engaged in any kind of work which has to be
forced on you. This place has to leave in you a memory of sheer
enjoyment, of silence and beauty. And people Osho - The Hidden
Splendor</p><p>215</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>who are non-interfering with you, are happy in your happiness. Nobody
is jealous, nobody is competitive. Nobody is even comparing.</p><p>But it all depends on you.</p><p>I have created the space here. Now how you use it, is up to you.</p><p>During the second world war, at the Russian front, an Italian and a
German general are preparing an attack. When all the preparations are
ready, and the attack is ready to be launched, the German general calls
his servant: "Heinz, bring me my red coat."</p><p>"What, a red coat?" says the Italian general surprised. "How
come?"</p><p>"Well, during the battle I may be hurt; blood may be flowing, and my
soldiers, seeing blood, might get demoralized. So I always wear a red
coat during battle."</p><p>"What a great idea," says the Italian general and calls his servant.
"Giuseppe, quick, bring my brown trousers!"</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I BLEW IT TODAY. ONE MOMENT OF UNAWARENESS FEELS LIKE IT WIPES</p><p>OUT THOSE MOMENTS OF AWARENESS. WHILE PRUNING IN YOUR GARDEN I CUT
DEEPLY INTO A LIVING TREE THAT I THOUGHT WAS DEAD. THE VERY</p><p>MOMENT THE AXE MADE ITS DEATH BLOW I KNEW, YOU KNEW, EXISTENCE</p><p>KNEW, I HAD TAKEN LIFE. FEELING GUILT, FEAR, STUPIDITY, I
FINISHED</p><p>CUTTING THE TREE, CARRYING IT OUT OF YOUR GARDEN. OSHO, I HAVE
CUT</p><p>THOUSANDS OF TREES AND KILLED MANY, MANY ANIMALS IN MY LIFE, BUT</p><p>NEVER BEFORE FELT HURT AS MUCH AS I DID, AND DO, ABOUT THIS TREE.</p><p>MUKTA IS AFRAID YOU'LL CUT OFF HER HEAD. SPARE HER HEAD AND CUT</p><p>MINE, ALONG WITH MY UNAWARENESS. I'M SORRY.</p><p>Anand Vibhavan, it is something tremendously beautiful that reverence
for life is arising in you. But don't feel any guilt, neither fear nor
stupidity, because these are parasites. Just do one thing: become more
alert and remember: before you cut another tree, make sure that it is
dead.</p><p>There is no hurry. It is simply unconsciousness; otherwise you would
have found that it was alive. Perhaps the leaves had fallen and the tree
was waiting for new leaves to come. And you could have waited and
watched... but guilt is not the right thing.</p><p>You hurt the tree; now you are hurting yourself.</p><p>Reverence for life does not mean reverence only for others' life. It
also includes reverence for your own life too.</p><p>Guilt is not reverence. Neither you are stupid -- because you became
aware; not only aware, but you felt hurt that a life is unnecessarily
destroyed. It shows intelligence.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 216</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>And as far as fear is concerned, don't be worried about Mukta. I have
chopped her head long ago -- she believes she has a head -- and I will
chop your head too.</p><p>But my surgery is not painful. It brings more blissfulness to you
than you had ever experienced. So there is no need to have fear. Just
have awareness, more alertness, more consciousness.</p><p>This garden is not just an ordinary garden. These trees have heard me
as much as you have heard me, and these trees have loved me as much as
you have loved me. These trees are as much my disciples as you are. So
be respectful with them. With loving care, with sensitive alertness, you
will not only be a good gardener, you will also become a higher
consciousness</p><p>-- more human, more divine.</p><p>Shower on these trees all your love. They cannot speak, but they are
very sensitive.</p><p>The latest experiments about trees are so revealing -- they can even
read your thoughts.</p><p>Their sensitivity is far greater than man's sensitivity.</p><p>Scientists have developed certain instruments like the cardiogram.
They put the cardiogram on a certain tree and the cardiogram starts
making a graph of how the tree is feeling. The graph is symmetrical, and
then suddenly they bring a woodcutter with an axe, and the moment the
tree sees the woodcutter the graph changes. It goes berserk, the
symmetry is lost. Nothing has been done to the tree, it is just that the
woodcutter has come with the idea to cut it. That idea is being caught
by the sensitiveness of the tree, and now, there are scientific ways to
find it out.</p><p>The strangest thing is that if the woodcutter is just passing without
any idea of cutting the tree, the graph does not change. It depends on
his idea -- his thought creates a certain wave.</p><p>Every thought is being broadcasted from your mind, creating waves
around you, and those waves are picked up by the sensitiveness of the
tree. They are very much alive.</p><p>It is good that you have become aware of it. Don't lose this
awareness, because it will not only help the trees, it will help you
too. It will become your meditation.</p><p>Everything that is being done here has to become your meditation.</p><p>This is a temple, and we are here just for a single reason: to
transcend our darkness and our unconsciousness.</p><p>A man goes into a men's toilet, holding his hands outstretched, as if
they are paralyzed. In the urinals, he taps another man on the
elbow.</p><p>"Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me. I have a problem with my
hands and need assistance in using the urinal. Would you be so kind as
to open my zipper?"</p><p>The other man is very embarrassed, but obliges. The first man says,
"Thank you very much. Now I have another favor to ask. Would you mind
helping me to aim?"</p><p>The second man blushes, but helps him aim. After he has relieved
himself, the first man says, "You don't know how grateful I am. Now
please just do me up again." Nearly at the end of his patience, the
second man does so.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 217</p><p>Chapter 21 - The greatest misfit in the world</p><p>The first man turns to leave, and looking at his awkwardly-held
hands, says, "Good. I think my nail polish is dry now."</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 218</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part95>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

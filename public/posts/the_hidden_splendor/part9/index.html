Don't be in a hurry, don't bring your knowledge to improve upon it. Nobody can improve upon nature: when the spring comes, the flowers will come also -- and there is no way to bring the spring, and without the spring the flowers won't come. So you go on the way you are moving. It is the right path, the easy path in your naturalness and spontaneity, and you will not be going astray.\nYou will reach to the ultimate ocean where one merges with the eternal life.\nKnowledge is really a very complicated phenomenon; you have to be like little children.\nLittle William went to his father and said, \"Daddy, where did I come from?\" The father started to stutter and stammer, but he realized that he had to tell his son the facts of life.\n\"Sit down, Willie,\" he said. At great length he described the whole business of creation, beginning with the birds and the bees. Then he went into the most graphic descriptions of human intercourse. He concluded at last, feeling limp and drained. He took a handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his brow: \"Okay, Willie, do you understand now?\"\nWillie scratched his head. \"Not really, Dad. Henry says he came from New Jersey, but you have not told me where I came from.\"\nHis question is of a very innocent character, but the father is a knowledgeable person. He gives a whole discourse on how human beings are produced -- and he is perspiring and stuttering and stammering. And the boy must be puzzled about what is going on? He has simply asked a simple question: Where did I come from? Such a complicated journey... and Henry has come from New Jersey.\nBe natural, be simple, be innocent, and allow nature to guide you -- it has never misguided anybody. Knowledge, on the contrary, has never been able to guide anybody to the ultimate goal, the ultimate peak of our experience, of our consciousness, of our blissfulness, of our enlightenment.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 88\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition 9\nPapal politics: organized superstition\n16 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU ARE AGAINST THE POPE SO MUCH -- IS THAT BECAUSE THE ROMAN\nCATHOLIC RELIGION IS THE MOST ORGANIZED RELIGION?\nAnand Maitreya, I am not against anyone -- but I am certainly for the truth. Anything that goes against the truth, I am determined to criticize; it is a sacred duty as far as I am concerned.\nThat the Roman Catholic religion is the most organized religion is only one of the reasons I am criticizing the pope so much. There are many other things, too.\nI would like to give you all the implications of my criticism. First, the Catholic church in particular, and Christianity in general, is not a religion at all. To call it an \"organized religion\"\nis to use the wrong language. It is organized superstition.\nIn the twenty centuries after Jesus, Christianity has been defending all kinds of superstitions, and fighting against science, against any discovery of truth. And the people who have been the leaders of this war between superstitions and\nscience are the popes.\nIn the first place, the popes down these twenty centuries have been declaring one thing: that they are infallible -- which is an absurdity. But their logic is: they represent Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is the only son of God. So, in an indirect way, they are the vehicles of God --\nhow can they be fallible?\nBut life is not logic. Your God itself is a fiction; Jesus Christ being the only begotten son is another fiction. And the infallibility of the pope is just ridiculous.\nWhen Galileo discovered for the first time that it is not the sun that goes around the earth, but the earth that goes around the sun -- he was very old, seventy-five or eighty, almost on his deathbed -- he was dragged to the court of the pope. And the pope said, \"Before you die, change that statement, because it goes against THE BIBLE. And anything that goes against THE BIBLE is automatically wrong, because THE BIBLE is the word of God.\"\nGalileo was a great scientist, and I have immense respect for a man who, even at the age of eighty, when he was dying, had such a beautiful sense of humor.\nHe said, \"There is no problem. I will change it; I will write in my book exactly what God has written in THE BIBLE -- that the sun goes around the earth. But one thing I must make clear to you: neither the sun reads my book nor the earth reads my book. As far as reality is concerned, the earth will continue going around the sun.\n\"And why should you insist? Because I have every proof; I have devoted my whole life to the search, and all those who have a scientific mind are in absolute agreement with me.\nSooner or later you will have to agree because one cannot remain against truth for long.\"\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 89\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nThe pope said, \"We cannot allow even a single statement to go against THE BIBLE for the simple reason that if one statement becomes false, God's infallibility disappears. And if God himself is fallible, what about Jesus Christ? And what about the pope? And if God can write one thing wrong, who knows? -- he may have written many things wrong. We cannot afford it.\"\nFor three hundred years, the popes have been fighting a hard battle against each and every scientific discovery of truth. Nobody can be victorious against truth, but they have tried their best. It is the only religion that has been fighting against science -- that is one of the fundamental reasons why I criticize the pope.\nEven today they go on fighting science, knowing perfectly well that each time they will be defeated, and that they are fighting a losing battle. And still, they go on declaring themselves infallible.\nIt is amazing that people can be so shameless. It is time they learned.\nThey crucified and burned Joan of Arc by the order of the pope, because he declared that she was a witch. Now on what grounds, what reasoning, what revelation? because the pope says it is so, it has to be right. The word of the pope is the law; the word of the pope is the truth. They burned a young, beautiful, courageous, intelligent woman who had fought for the freedom of the country and who had won the freedom of the country. And that was the reason for the jealousy -- that a woman should become so prominent that even the pope is left behind.\nShe was burned because of jealousy; she had not committed any sin. The whole of Europe was shocked and slowly, slowly, people started raising their voices against her crucifixion; but it took almost three hundred years for people to be so strong about it that another pope declared Joan of Arc a great saint.\nOne pope burns her alive because she is a witch -- she is in sexual relationship with the devil. And after three hundred years, another pope -- his own descendant, his own successor, representative of the same Jesus Christ and the same God -- declares that she was a saint. Her bones were taken out of the grave and worshiped, and a beautiful cathedral now stands in her memory. Now, nobody calls her just \"Joan of Arc\" -- her name is \"Saint Joan of Arc.\"\nThe pope goes on traveling around the world preaching that birth control is against God, that any method of preventing the birth of a child is anti-God -- particularly in the countries of the East where people are so poor, and they are going to become poorer and poorer every day.\nBut the pope's interest is not that man should live comfortably without hunger. People should not die just because they cannot even get water, cannot get food.\nAnd you will be surprised to know that on one hand, the pope goes on talking against birth control methods, and on the other, the Vatican has a hidden factory where they create birth control pills -- because it is good business; it brings millions of dollars.\nYou call such people religious?\nHe goes around the world saying that Christian priests and bishops and cardinals should not get involved in politics -- because he wants politicians to be in favor of him. And it has been found that the same man sent one hundred million dollars to Poland, to a political party, to fight against the Communists.\nIs this not politics?\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 90\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nAnd his interest in birth control is really to increase the population. Whatever consequences happen to people is not the problem. If people are poor and hungry, they can be easily converted to Christianity, and particularly the Catholic church. Their schools, their hospitals, their orphanages are nothing but factories for converting people into Catholics.\nIt is now a well-known fact that by the end of the century, almost half the population of the world will be dying of hunger. You cannot even conceive of the situation where one man out of every two will be dying. All around there will be corpses and there will be nobody even to bury them or to take them to the mortuary or to the funeral. In fact, dying will be better than living amongst those\ncorpses.\nThe whole world will be stinking of death.\nThe popes don't seem to be interested in saving humanity. Their basic interest is how to get more and more people into their religion, because that is going to be their power. It is pure politics.\nThe whole Christian theology is based on such stupid ideas that to call it \"religion\" is just absurd. Jesus is born of a virgin mother. The whole of medical science is against it -- it cannot be possible, but it is one of their fundamentals. If you remove it, the whole edifice of Christianity falls down.\nThey have not given the world any method for how to raise consciousness. They have not produced awakened and enlightened people; but they have caught seven hundred million people in the Catholic fold alone. These people are full of absurd beliefs -- and even though they have eyes, they don't see; they have ears, but they don't hear. And if you say anything, immediately they are ready to crucify you. They are against the crucifixion of Jesus, but they are, every moment, ready to crucify you if you just tell the truth.\nI said in one of my speeches, that THE HOLY BIBLE is the most unholy book in the whole world, because it has five hundred solid pages of pure pornography. One of my friends in America, hearing this, actually collected all those five hundred pages and published a book called the X-RATED HOLY BIBLE. And now I have received a summons from Kanpur -- ten Christian associations have made a case against me; that I am hurting their religious feelings.\nI cannot believe that people are so blind. If anything is hurting your religious feelings it is your BIBLE -- I have nothing to do with it. You should tell the government that THE BIBLE\nshould be banned, or it should be labeled and listed among the pornographic literature.\nI am not saying anything myself. Those five hundred pages are there in THE BIBLE and those ten associations at least could have looked in their BIBLES to see what I am talking about; otherwise in the court they will look absolutely foolish.\nNow, they are creating agitation in every country for homosexuality to be made a severe crime. And everybody in the world knows that Pope Paul the Sixth was a homosexual. Before he became the pope, he was the cardinal in Milan -- and that was the talk of the town. The whole of Milan was surprised that he was always seen with his boyfriend -- a young, beautiful man. Knowing this perfectly well... still he became the pope. And the moment he became pope, his boyfriend was called to the Vatican, and the boyfriend became the secretary.\nOrdinarily, the secretary becomes the girlfriend; here, it was just a little different... but the same story.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 91\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nAnd it has never been denied by the Vatican; they could not deny it -- it was so factual.\nBut if you say it, that means you are against the pope. I am not against the pope. I am just in favor of truth.\nBut perhaps this kind of thing begins with the virginity of Mary and the birth of Jesus. I have heard... it is a story of the future, because this Polack pope seems to be very slow to die.\nPopes ordinarily have died within an average of one or two years at the most because by the time they become popes, they are always around the age of seventy-five, seventy-eight. And they must have been hoping that this Polack would also die -- but they don't know Polacks. He has completely forgotten about dying; and he is enjoying his popehood so greatly -- no other pope has ever done such things.\nHe is continuously touring around the world, and the Vatican is getting into debt: nine million dollars he has spent on traveling. The last time he went to Australia, just two days before him the British queen had also gone to Australia. More money was spent on the pope's visit to Australia than on that of the queen of England. And these are the people who say,\n\"Blessed are the poor.\"\nBut finally, the Polack pope died and went to heaven with pomp and circumstance. At the pearly gates, Saint Peter stopped him and said, \"Hey, you can't walk in just like that. Who are you?\"\nThe pope answered, \"Well, I am your very own representative on earth. I am the pope.\"\nSaint Peter said, \"Pope? My representative? I have never heard of you.\"\nThe pope, puzzled, said, \"Ah, just tell God I am here. He will tell you to let me in.\"\nSaint Peter yelled, \"Hey, boss, a guy here says he is the pope. Do you know him?\"\nGod answered, \"Never heard of him.\" The pope said, \"Strange, but ask Jesus. He knows me.\"\nSaint Peter yelled, \"Hey, sonny. There is a guy here says he is the pope. You know him?\"\nJesus answered, \"No.\"\nSaint Peter said, \"Sorry, I can't let you in. Nobody around here knows you.\"\nThe pope said, \"You can't turn me away like this. I am the pope himself. Ask the Holy Ghost. He knows me for sure.\"\nSaint Peter yelled again, \"Hey, spook! A guy here claims you know him. Says he is the pope.\"\nAnd the Holy Ghost shouted, \"The pope, sure I know him. He is the guy that spread those dirty rumors about me and Mary. Kick him out of here.\"\nThe whole religion is founded on a dirty joke.\nPope Paul the Sixth, who was the homosexual, was followed by Pope John Paul the First.\nHe was an intelligent, liberal man who ordered an investigation of the cardinals and bishops who belonged to Masonic Lodges, which were outlawed by the Catholic church.\nThese Masonic Lodges have as their members only the wealthiest people of the world.\nThey are secret societies doing secret rituals. They were outlawed by Christianity -- no Christian priest, bishop or cardinal, or anybody officiating in any position, should be a member of any Masonic Lodge -- because their secret rituals consist of sexual orgies and all Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n92\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nkinds of ugly things. John Paul the First ordered an investigation of the cardinals and bishops who belonged to these Masonic Lodges. He discovered that many top Vatican officials were Freemasons, and ordered that they be removed from office.\nYou see the hypocrisy? These are the same people who made the law that no Christian priest could become members of Masonic Lodges, but in the Vatican itself, the cardinals and bishops and archbishops were found to be members of Masonic Lodges. And because John Paul the First ordered that they be removed from office, the whole Catholic hierarchy and bureaucracy turned against that intelligent man. In the whole history of Christianity, perhaps he was the only pope who had some intelligence, some humanity, some understanding.\nAt the same time, he ordered an investigation into the Vatican bank which would have shown that the bank was laundering hundreds of millions of dollars of Mafia heroin money every year.\nThese are your religious institutions. The Vatican bank itself, which is under the pope, is nothing but the greatest Mafia organization. Hundreds of millions of dollars of heroin money... They go on talking and preaching against drugs, while behind the curtain they are dealing in drugs themselves.\nHe also ordered a meeting to announce that the church supported birth control. He was really a man of understanding -- he wanted to call the pill the \"Catholic\npill.\" But before any of these orders could be carried out, he was found dead in suspicious circumstances.\nHe was murdered. Vatican officials said it was of a heart attack, but that is absolutely wrong because his own personal physician said he had a perfect heart\n-- he had had no heart trouble, ever. And the most important thing was that his personal physician was not called.\nInstead, the Vatican officials ordered immediate embalming and refused to let his personal physician examine the body -- even the dead body. They also refused a post-mortem. No death certificate was issued; even up to now, officially he is living because there was no death certificate issued for him.\nAfter they had embalmed him, an autopsy was done. But once you embalm a dead body --\nonce you take all the blood out of the body and fill it with chemicals -- it becomes impossible to find whether it has been poisoned or what has happened. But the whole situation is very clear: insiders say that papers he was clutching in his hand when the body was discovered were the papers in which he had written his will. Realizing in the middle of the night that he has been poisoned, feeling that he was going to die, he may have tried to write his will. Or he may have tried to write what had happened to him, what had been done to him. But all those papers mysteriously disappeared, along with his medicine bottle and the will. It has been thought that they mixed poison in his medicine bottle, and he drank the poison, thinking it was medicine. Once the poison started having its effects, he must have tried to write his will, and he tried to write that it seemed he had been poisoned and that he was dying. The people who found him first saw the will he was clutching in his hands.\nAnd the most amazing thing is: even before his body was found, orders for embalming the body were given because the people who were in the conspiracy were aware that in the morning the embalmers would be needed, so every arrangement was made beforehand.\nIt was not an accidental death.\nHe was followed by Pope John Paul the Second, the Polack who prohibited all birth control methods except the rhythm method -- even though the Vatican actually owned a Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n93\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\ncompany which made birth control pills. He also dropped the church law forbidding membership in the Freemasons. And he promoted Marcinkus, the head of the Vatican bank, to Archbishop, and made him part of his personal group. This is the man who was running all the Mafia heroin money through the bank.\nIn 1982 Archbishop Marcinkus was involved in a huge financial scandal after an Italian bank collapsed. One of his business friends was found hanged beneath a London bridge. And another colleague, who was in jail on charges of murdering a police commissioner, died from drinking coffee with cyanide. These were the people who could have been witnesses against Archbishop Marcinkus; these two people knew all the secrets -- and both were killed.\nA warrant for the arrest of the Archbishop had been issued, but the Vatican is a separate government -- just eight square miles -- and the Italian government has no power to interfere in the Vatican. And the pope was hiding the man inside the Vatican; the arrest warrant was waiting outside. These are your religious leaders.\nThe Polack pope also strongly reprimanded priests around the world for their involvement in politics, but he himself ordered one hundred million dollars of Vatican money to go to the Solidarity group in Poland who were fighting the communist government.\nI am against organized religion because the moment anything becomes organized, it has its own vested interest. Then religion is forgotten -- other things become more important. Truth and the search for truth need your total involvement; nothing else should be in the way.\nOrganized religion becomes a prison. It gives you ready-made doctrines, and your only function is to believe in them -- whether they are reasonable, logical, or not. You are not supposed to experiment on your own because, who knows? -- you may find something which goes against the official doctrine.\nBut official doctrine cannot become your enlightenment. The official doctrine can make you learned, scholarly -- but it cannot make you wise, it cannot make you intuitive, it cannot make you aware of God.\nI am criticizing the pope because he is not only the head of an organized religion, but also the head of a government. It is not much of a government, eight square miles, but still, he is being accepted as head of a country; he has his representatives in the U.N.; he has his ambassadors in different countries.\nReligion is something so high, and politics is so low that one thing has to be remembered: whenever there is a mixture of something lower with something higher, it is always the higher which becomes polluted -- not the lower. It is always the higher which loses its quality of being higher. The lower has nothing to lose; it cannot fall any more -- it has already fallen to its uttermost.\nReligion and politics should be separate.\nAnd the moment religion becomes organized, it becomes politics. Hence religion should not be organized at all; it should be everybody's private, personal, intimate search.\nAt least some area of life should be left to the individual where he is totally free, without anybody else deciding for him, where he can open his wings like an eagle and fly across the sun -- no chains, no bondages, no hindrances.\nReligion blossoms only in a heart which is absolutely free of all doctrines, all beliefs, all churches, all mosques.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 94\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nI want the whole world to be religious but not Christian, not Catholic, not Hindu, not Mohammedan. Just to be religious is enough.\nCan't you see these simple facts? Honesty is honesty -- it is neither Christian nor Hindu.\nTruth is simply truth -- it cannot be Mohammedan, it cannot be Christian. Love is simply love\n-- it cannot be Eastern and it cannot be Western. Compassion is compassion -- it\ndoes not belong to any race, to any country, to any climate; it is not dependent on any geography, or any history. These are the ingredients of a religious consciousness.\nMeditation is simply so scientific that just as you accept physics without bothering about whether it is Hindu or Mohammedan, you accept chemistry without ever thinking whether it is Protestant or Catholic... When you go to the doctor, you never bother whether the medicine is Hindu or Buddhist.\nThe inner reality is simply a pure silence: thousands of flowers blossom there but they don't belong to any organization. They are the reward of your own search, of your own inward-going.\nAll the organized religions care basically depriving humanity of religion because they are misdirecting you. They are always directing you outwards -- their God is far away in the sky.\nAnd when you pray, folding your hands towards the sky, you don't realize that there is nobody to hear you.\nIn fact, the one who is praying, the one who is alive in you, the one who is breathing in you, is the God.\nYou have just to discover it.\nIt is hidden in the layers of your false personality. Find out, in your innocence, and life becomes a sheer joy, a song without words, a dance, a celebration.\nAnd at the very end of your celebration, there is nothing but tears of gratitude. I cannot think or conceive that those tears of gratitude belong to any religion. They belong to the individual heart, overflowing with gratefulness towards existence.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER MORNING BEFORE LECTURE, I SUDDENLY FELT AN OVERWHELMING URGE TO TOUCH, WITH GREAT GRATITUDE, THE\nFLOOR\nWHERE YOU WALK. IN THAT MOMENT, I HEARD AGAIN THAT VOICE\n-- IT STILL\nSOUNDS LIKE YOUR VOICE: \"IF YOU CAN KISS IN GRATITUDE THE PLACE ON\nEARTH WHERE I HAVE STEPPED... I WANT TO TELL YOU, THAT I'VE STEPPED\nEVERYWHERE ON THIS EARTH. \"THIS IS REALLY TOO MUCH, FOR I SEE MYSELF\nIN TEARS, KISSING EVERY SPOT ON THE EARTH. AND AGAIN THAT VOICE\nCOMES IN ME, OR FROM ME, WHISPERING, \"IF YOU CAN KISS IN GRATITUDE\nALL THE EARTH, AND ALL THAT ABIDES ON THE EARTH, YOU DON'T NEED ME\nANYMORE. \"PLEASE, OSHO, TELL ME THAT I WAS JUST IMAGINING, THAT IT\nWAS JUST A DREAM. YOU HAVEN'T SAID THAT TO ME, HAVE YOU?\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 95\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nSarjano, the idea is Catholic. You come from the country of the pope, and that fellow goes on kissing the earth wherever he goes -- even in India, where kissing the earth means kissing cow dung. When he kissed it here, that very day I said, \"He has tasted something of Hindu religion.\"\nIt is just your imagination, Sarjano. There is no need for your gratitude to be\nexpressed in stupid gestures. Just being grateful, your eyes full of tears, your heart just melting and merging with existence, is enough. Kissing the earth is just an idiotic symbol; I could never have said anything like this to you. But you love me, and you are so full of me that even if you speak in your imagination, you may hear my voice.\nBut remember one thing: except for silence, everything else is your imagination\n--\nhowsoever beautiful. Only your silence I can say has my support, because only in your silence are you close to the very center of existence. In absolute silence, you become the very center yourself. But remember to avoid any kind of imagination -- all imagination -- even beautiful imagination, apparently looking like the divine.\nIt happened once: I had a few Mohammedan friends and they were followers of a Sufi mystic. The mystic used to come to the city once a year to see his disciples, and they were continuously telling me, \"This time when he comes, some way has to be found so that you both can meet.\"\nI said, \"There is no problem with it. I can be his host; he can be my guest. That will be the best thing because he is going to be here three days, so for three days we can be together.\"\nThey liked the idea. The most impressive thing to them in the Sufi mystic was that he saw God everywhere: he would see a tree and he would go and hug the tree and start talking to the tree. Almost in a trance, he would kiss the earth; he would hold your hand and kiss it and he would start talking in a trance and address you as \"God! My Lord!\" People were very impressed.\nHe came to stay with me. Before he could kiss my hand, I said, \"Wait! Do you really see God in me or have you been imagining for years?\" -- because that is one of the traditions in the Sufis: you start imagining and slowly, slowly, the imagination becomes a reality.\nHe was shocked. There was a moment of silence -- painful silence, because his disciples were there. But he was an honest man; he said, \"Ah, at least thirty years ago I started on the path, and this was the path shown by my teacher: 'Look into everything for God.'\n\"In the beginning, it was difficult to see God in a camel, in a donkey, in a buffalo. But my master insisted: All these forms are gods; you don't have to judge them -- your path is just to see God in everything, so that one day you can see God everywhere. And I succeeded in three years, and I started seeing God everywhere. Now I see God everywhere.\"\nI said, \"Just listen to me. For the three days you will be here, stop imagining. Just see things as they are: a table is a table, not God; a camel is a camel, not God; and a buffalo is a buffalo, not God -- just for three days.\"\nHe was very reluctant and afraid and nervous, but he was staying with me, so I said, \"I will remind you about this kissing and hugging -- don't forget! After three days you can hug with a vengeance, because no tree can prevent how much you hug it. For three days... you can fill the quota afterwards, but for three days I will be constantly after you. You have to see things as they are.\"\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 96\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nThere was no need for three days. Within just one day, in twenty-four hours, the god that had been there for thirty years, disappeared. In the morning, he was very angry at me. He said,\n\"What have you done? I really see a table is a table! Just now I saw a man going by on a bicycle, and I saw neither the god in the man, nor in the bicycle. You destroyed my thirty years of practice.\"\nI said, \"Just think a little. If something that you have spent thirty years discovering was really true, then in one day it could not disappear. For thirty years you have lived in a hallucination -- you created the hallucination, and the hallucination can be so strong that all doubts disappear. And thirty years is a long time.\"\nI told him a story of Ramakrishna which is very rare in the history of mystics. After attaining enlightenment, nobody ever tries to look into other paths to see whether they also reach to enlightenment or not -- there is no point. You wanted to reach here, you have reached\n-- now what is the point of finding out whether other roads also reach here or not? But Ramakrishna had something tremendously significant on his mind, so he gave six months to each religion that was available in his vicinity; for six months he would practice the religion and forget everything else. Of course, he was already enlightened so the path was not a problem; in six months, he would reach back to the point of consciousness.\nIn Bengal, there is a small local group of a very strange religion: they believe that Krishna is the only man, and those who follow him are all women. They may be men, but that is only an illusion; in reality, except for Krishna, there is no other man -- all are women. He is the lover and you are the beloved. In the night, the followers of that sect, men and women both, dress alike -- like women. And even men sleep with a statue of Krishna in their beds -- he is their husband.\nRamakrishna followed that path also for six months. For others it was just a ritual; they were born into that religion, just as you are born into Christianity, or Hinduism, or Jainism.\nYou don't really care; it is just accidental that you are born into a certain religion and you follow it, but it is a formality -- at the most.\nBut Ramakrishna was not going into those processes in a formal way: when he was following something, he was following it with totality and intensity. And almost a miracle was seen! Even in the day, he used the same clothes as women use in Bengal. Even the people of that sect told him, \"In the day you can use men's clothes; otherwise it looks very awkward.\"\nBut he said, \"When I follow something, I follow it totally. I cannot divide my day from my night. And I don't care about the world.\"\nHis breasts started growing; his disciples became very much afraid. So much intensity of projecting that even the doctors who came to know about it when they visited Ramakrishna and saw his breasts, could not believe it -- because this was a physiological miracle. But his disciples whispered in the ears of the doctor, \"This is nothing -- he is having monthly periods!\"\nFor six months continuously... his voice changed, it became more like a woman's. He started walking like a woman -- which is very difficult; difficult because only a woman can walk that way. She has a womb inside her body and that womb gives a different kind of movement to the legs. Man has no womb\ninside; his legs have a different movement.\nHe started walking like a woman, speaking like a woman, his voice changed. And when the menstrual period started, then the disciples became really afraid. They said, \"We have lost Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n97\nChapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition\nhim. How can we get him back?\" They tried to persuade him, but until six months was up, he was not going to change his path. They said, \"This path is dangerous. We don't think that these breasts and this period are going to disappear even after six months. Your whole life you will be a laughingstock -- and we are going to be laughingstocks because we are your disciples.\"\nIt took almost six months after he stopped for the change to take place again. Slowly, slowly, he became a man again -- before that he had become a woman. Such a deep psychological projection... It is through such projections that people are experiencing Krishna, Jesus, Buddha -- and when they experience it, they see it.\nAnd if you say to them that it is only an illusion, how can they believe you? Their illusion looks more real than you are. Mind has a capacity to project anything and make it appear almost real; or sometimes, if the mind is very powerful, even more than real.\nBut my path is not the path of imagination: It is the path that does not use the mind at all.\nImagination and projection and hallucination and illusion -- they are all parts of the mind.\nMy simple approach is transcendence of mind; so only when you start seeing absolute nothingness, utter silence, can you see that I am very close by.\nIn that silence, you have heard me; in that nothingness, you have seen me. But if you see something, if you hear something, then it is your imagination -- you have fallen from the beyond, back into the mind.\nOnly one thing has to be remembered: the mind is the world -- and going beyond the mind is the beginning of God.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 98\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6093","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/>The Hidden Splendor</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 8 - The taste of your being</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6093 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Hidden_Splendor/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Don't be in a hurry, don't bring your knowledge to improve upon it.
Nobody can improve upon nature: when the spring comes, the flowers will
come also -- and there is no way to bring the spring, and without the
spring the flowers won't come. So you go on the way you are moving. It
is the right path, the easy path in your naturalness and spontaneity,
and you will not be going astray.</p><p>You will reach to the ultimate ocean where one merges with the
eternal life.</p><p>Knowledge is really a very complicated phenomenon; you have to be
like little children.</p><p>Little William went to his father and said, "Daddy, where did I come
from?" The father started to stutter and stammer, but he realized that
he had to tell his son the facts of life.</p><p>"Sit down, Willie," he said. At great length he described the whole
business of creation, beginning with the birds and the bees. Then he
went into the most graphic descriptions of human intercourse. He
concluded at last, feeling limp and drained. He took a handkerchief and
wiped the perspiration from his brow: "Okay, Willie, do you understand
now?"</p><p>Willie scratched his head. "Not really, Dad. Henry says he came from
New Jersey, but you have not told me where I came from."</p><p>His question is of a very innocent character, but the father is a
knowledgeable person. He gives a whole discourse on how human beings are
produced -- and he is perspiring and stuttering and stammering. And the
boy must be puzzled about what is going on? He has simply asked a simple
question: Where did I come from? Such a complicated journey... and Henry
has come from New Jersey.</p><p>Be natural, be simple, be innocent, and allow nature to guide you --
it has never misguided anybody. Knowledge, on the contrary, has never
been able to guide anybody to the ultimate goal, the ultimate peak of
our experience, of our consciousness, of our blissfulness, of our
enlightenment.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 88</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition 9</p><p>Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>16 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU ARE AGAINST THE POPE SO MUCH -- IS THAT BECAUSE THE ROMAN</p><p>CATHOLIC RELIGION IS THE MOST ORGANIZED RELIGION?</p><p>Anand Maitreya, I am not against anyone -- but I am certainly for the
truth. Anything that goes against the truth, I am determined to
criticize; it is a sacred duty as far as I am concerned.</p><p>That the Roman Catholic religion is the most organized religion is
only one of the reasons I am criticizing the pope so much. There are
many other things, too.</p><p>I would like to give you all the implications of my criticism. First,
the Catholic church in particular, and Christianity in general, is not a
religion at all. To call it an "organized religion"</p><p>is to use the wrong language. It is organized superstition.</p><p>In the twenty centuries after Jesus, Christianity has been defending
all kinds of superstitions, and fighting against science, against any
discovery of truth. And the people who have been the leaders of this war
between superstitions and</p><p>science are the popes.</p><p>In the first place, the popes down these twenty centuries have been
declaring one thing: that they are infallible -- which is an absurdity.
But their logic is: they represent Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is the
only son of God. So, in an indirect way, they are the vehicles of God
--</p><p>how can they be fallible?</p><p>But life is not logic. Your God itself is a fiction; Jesus Christ
being the only begotten son is another fiction. And the infallibility of
the pope is just ridiculous.</p><p>When Galileo discovered for the first time that it is not the sun
that goes around the earth, but the earth that goes around the sun -- he
was very old, seventy-five or eighty, almost on his deathbed -- he was
dragged to the court of the pope. And the pope said, "Before you die,
change that statement, because it goes against THE BIBLE. And anything
that goes against THE BIBLE is automatically wrong, because THE BIBLE is
the word of God."</p><p>Galileo was a great scientist, and I have immense respect for a man
who, even at the age of eighty, when he was dying, had such a beautiful
sense of humor.</p><p>He said, "There is no problem. I will change it; I will write in my
book exactly what God has written in THE BIBLE -- that the sun goes
around the earth. But one thing I must make clear to you: neither the
sun reads my book nor the earth reads my book. As far as reality is
concerned, the earth will continue going around the sun.</p><p>"And why should you insist? Because I have every proof; I have
devoted my whole life to the search, and all those who have a scientific
mind are in absolute agreement with me.</p><p>Sooner or later you will have to agree because one cannot remain
against truth for long."</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 89</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>The pope said, "We cannot allow even a single statement to go against
THE BIBLE for the simple reason that if one statement becomes false,
God's infallibility disappears. And if God himself is fallible, what
about Jesus Christ? And what about the pope? And if God can write one
thing wrong, who knows? -- he may have written many things wrong. We
cannot afford it."</p><p>For three hundred years, the popes have been fighting a hard battle
against each and every scientific discovery of truth. Nobody can be
victorious against truth, but they have tried their best. It is the only
religion that has been fighting against science -- that is one of the
fundamental reasons why I criticize the pope.</p><p>Even today they go on fighting science, knowing perfectly well that
each time they will be defeated, and that they are fighting a losing
battle. And still, they go on declaring themselves infallible.</p><p>It is amazing that people can be so shameless. It is time they
learned.</p><p>They crucified and burned Joan of Arc by the order of the pope,
because he declared that she was a witch. Now on what grounds, what
reasoning, what revelation? because the pope says it is so, it has to be
right. The word of the pope is the law; the word of the pope is the
truth. They burned a young, beautiful, courageous, intelligent woman who
had fought for the freedom of the country and who had won the freedom of
the country. And that was the reason for the jealousy -- that a woman
should become so prominent that even the pope is left behind.</p><p>She was burned because of jealousy; she had not committed any sin.
The whole of Europe was shocked and slowly, slowly, people started
raising their voices against her crucifixion; but it took almost three
hundred years for people to be so strong about it that another pope
declared Joan of Arc a great saint.</p><p>One pope burns her alive because she is a witch -- she is in sexual
relationship with the devil. And after three hundred years, another pope
-- his own descendant, his own successor, representative of the same
Jesus Christ and the same God -- declares that she was a saint. Her
bones were taken out of the grave and worshiped, and a beautiful
cathedral now stands in her memory. Now, nobody calls her just "Joan of
Arc" -- her name is "Saint Joan of Arc."</p><p>The pope goes on traveling around the world preaching that birth
control is against God, that any method of preventing the birth of a
child is anti-God -- particularly in the countries of the East where
people are so poor, and they are going to become poorer and poorer every
day.</p><p>But the pope's interest is not that man should live comfortably
without hunger. People should not die just because they cannot even get
water, cannot get food.</p><p>And you will be surprised to know that on one hand, the pope goes on
talking against birth control methods, and on the other, the Vatican has
a hidden factory where they create birth control pills -- because it is
good business; it brings millions of dollars.</p><p>You call such people religious?</p><p>He goes around the world saying that Christian priests and bishops
and cardinals should not get involved in politics -- because he wants
politicians to be in favor of him. And it has been found that the same
man sent one hundred million dollars to Poland, to a political party, to
fight against the Communists.</p><p>Is this not politics?</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 90</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>And his interest in birth control is really to increase the
population. Whatever consequences happen to people is not the problem.
If people are poor and hungry, they can be easily converted to
Christianity, and particularly the Catholic church. Their schools, their
hospitals, their orphanages are nothing but factories for converting
people into Catholics.</p><p>It is now a well-known fact that by the end of the century, almost
half the population of the world will be dying of hunger. You cannot
even conceive of the situation where one man out of every two will be
dying. All around there will be corpses and there will be nobody even to
bury them or to take them to the mortuary or to the funeral. In fact,
dying will be better than living amongst those</p><p>corpses.</p><p>The whole world will be stinking of death.</p><p>The popes don't seem to be interested in saving humanity. Their basic
interest is how to get more and more people into their religion, because
that is going to be their power. It is pure politics.</p><p>The whole Christian theology is based on such stupid ideas that to
call it "religion" is just absurd. Jesus is born of a virgin mother. The
whole of medical science is against it -- it cannot be possible, but it
is one of their fundamentals. If you remove it, the whole edifice of
Christianity falls down.</p><p>They have not given the world any method for how to raise
consciousness. They have not produced awakened and enlightened people;
but they have caught seven hundred million people in the Catholic fold
alone. These people are full of absurd beliefs -- and even though they
have eyes, they don't see; they have ears, but they don't hear. And if
you say anything, immediately they are ready to crucify you. They are
against the crucifixion of Jesus, but they are, every moment, ready to
crucify you if you just tell the truth.</p><p>I said in one of my speeches, that THE HOLY BIBLE is the most unholy
book in the whole world, because it has five hundred solid pages of pure
pornography. One of my friends in America, hearing this, actually
collected all those five hundred pages and published a book called the
X-RATED HOLY BIBLE. And now I have received a summons from Kanpur -- ten
Christian associations have made a case against me; that I am hurting
their religious feelings.</p><p>I cannot believe that people are so blind. If anything is hurting
your religious feelings it is your BIBLE -- I have nothing to do with
it. You should tell the government that THE BIBLE</p><p>should be banned, or it should be labeled and listed among the
pornographic literature.</p><p>I am not saying anything myself. Those five hundred pages are there
in THE BIBLE and those ten associations at least could have looked in
their BIBLES to see what I am talking about; otherwise in the court they
will look absolutely foolish.</p><p>Now, they are creating agitation in every country for homosexuality
to be made a severe crime. And everybody in the world knows that Pope
Paul the Sixth was a homosexual. Before he became the pope, he was the
cardinal in Milan -- and that was the talk of the town. The whole of
Milan was surprised that he was always seen with his boyfriend -- a
young, beautiful man. Knowing this perfectly well... still he became the
pope. And the moment he became pope, his boyfriend was called to the
Vatican, and the boyfriend became the secretary.</p><p>Ordinarily, the secretary becomes the girlfriend; here, it was just a
little different... but the same story.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 91</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>And it has never been denied by the Vatican; they could not deny it
-- it was so factual.</p><p>But if you say it, that means you are against the pope. I am not
against the pope. I am just in favor of truth.</p><p>But perhaps this kind of thing begins with the virginity of Mary and
the birth of Jesus. I have heard... it is a story of the future, because
this Polack pope seems to be very slow to die.</p><p>Popes ordinarily have died within an average of one or two years at
the most because by the time they become popes, they are always around
the age of seventy-five, seventy-eight. And they must have been hoping
that this Polack would also die -- but they don't know Polacks. He has
completely forgotten about dying; and he is enjoying his popehood so
greatly -- no other pope has ever done such things.</p><p>He is continuously touring around the world, and the Vatican is
getting into debt: nine million dollars he has spent on traveling. The
last time he went to Australia, just two days before him the British
queen had also gone to Australia. More money was spent on the pope's
visit to Australia than on that of the queen of England. And these are
the people who say,</p><p>"Blessed are the poor."</p><p>But finally, the Polack pope died and went to heaven with pomp and
circumstance. At the pearly gates, Saint Peter stopped him and said,
"Hey, you can't walk in just like that. Who are you?"</p><p>The pope answered, "Well, I am your very own representative on earth.
I am the pope."</p><p>Saint Peter said, "Pope? My representative? I have never heard of
you."</p><p>The pope, puzzled, said, "Ah, just tell God I am here. He will tell
you to let me in."</p><p>Saint Peter yelled, "Hey, boss, a guy here says he is the pope. Do
you know him?"</p><p>God answered, "Never heard of him." The pope said, "Strange, but ask
Jesus. He knows me."</p><p>Saint Peter yelled, "Hey, sonny. There is a guy here says he is the
pope. You know him?"</p><p>Jesus answered, "No."</p><p>Saint Peter said, "Sorry, I can't let you in. Nobody around here
knows you."</p><p>The pope said, "You can't turn me away like this. I am the pope
himself. Ask the Holy Ghost. He knows me for sure."</p><p>Saint Peter yelled again, "Hey, spook! A guy here claims you know
him. Says he is the pope."</p><p>And the Holy Ghost shouted, "The pope, sure I know him. He is the guy
that spread those dirty rumors about me and Mary. Kick him out of
here."</p><p>The whole religion is founded on a dirty joke.</p><p>Pope Paul the Sixth, who was the homosexual, was followed by Pope
John Paul the First.</p><p>He was an intelligent, liberal man who ordered an investigation of
the cardinals and bishops who belonged to Masonic Lodges, which were
outlawed by the Catholic church.</p><p>These Masonic Lodges have as their members only the wealthiest people
of the world.</p><p>They are secret societies doing secret rituals. They were outlawed by
Christianity -- no Christian priest, bishop or cardinal, or anybody
officiating in any position, should be a member of any Masonic Lodge --
because their secret rituals consist of sexual orgies and all Osho - The
Hidden Splendor</p><p>92</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>kinds of ugly things. John Paul the First ordered an investigation of
the cardinals and bishops who belonged to these Masonic Lodges. He
discovered that many top Vatican officials were Freemasons, and ordered
that they be removed from office.</p><p>You see the hypocrisy? These are the same people who made the law
that no Christian priest could become members of Masonic Lodges, but in
the Vatican itself, the cardinals and bishops and archbishops were found
to be members of Masonic Lodges. And because John Paul the First ordered
that they be removed from office, the whole Catholic hierarchy and
bureaucracy turned against that intelligent man. In the whole history of
Christianity, perhaps he was the only pope who had some intelligence,
some humanity, some understanding.</p><p>At the same time, he ordered an investigation into the Vatican bank
which would have shown that the bank was laundering hundreds of millions
of dollars of Mafia heroin money every year.</p><p>These are your religious institutions. The Vatican bank itself, which
is under the pope, is nothing but the greatest Mafia organization.
Hundreds of millions of dollars of heroin money... They go on talking
and preaching against drugs, while behind the curtain they are dealing
in drugs themselves.</p><p>He also ordered a meeting to announce that the church supported birth
control. He was really a man of understanding -- he wanted to call the
pill the "Catholic</p><p>pill." But before any of these orders could be carried out, he was
found dead in suspicious circumstances.</p><p>He was murdered. Vatican officials said it was of a heart attack, but
that is absolutely wrong because his own personal physician said he had
a perfect heart</p><p>-- he had had no heart trouble, ever. And the most important thing
was that his personal physician was not called.</p><p>Instead, the Vatican officials ordered immediate embalming and
refused to let his personal physician examine the body -- even the dead
body. They also refused a post-mortem. No death certificate was issued;
even up to now, officially he is living because there was no death
certificate issued for him.</p><p>After they had embalmed him, an autopsy was done. But once you embalm
a dead body --</p><p>once you take all the blood out of the body and fill it with
chemicals -- it becomes impossible to find whether it has been poisoned
or what has happened. But the whole situation is very clear: insiders
say that papers he was clutching in his hand when the body was
discovered were the papers in which he had written his will. Realizing
in the middle of the night that he has been poisoned, feeling that he
was going to die, he may have tried to write his will. Or he may have
tried to write what had happened to him, what had been done to him. But
all those papers mysteriously disappeared, along with his medicine
bottle and the will. It has been thought that they mixed poison in his
medicine bottle, and he drank the poison, thinking it was medicine. Once
the poison started having its effects, he must have tried to write his
will, and he tried to write that it seemed he had been poisoned and that
he was dying. The people who found him first saw the will he was
clutching in his hands.</p><p>And the most amazing thing is: even before his body was found, orders
for embalming the body were given because the people who were in the
conspiracy were aware that in the morning the embalmers would be needed,
so every arrangement was made beforehand.</p><p>It was not an accidental death.</p><p>He was followed by Pope John Paul the Second, the Polack who
prohibited all birth control methods except the rhythm method -- even
though the Vatican actually owned a Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>93</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>company which made birth control pills. He also dropped the church
law forbidding membership in the Freemasons. And he promoted Marcinkus,
the head of the Vatican bank, to Archbishop, and made him part of his
personal group. This is the man who was running all the Mafia heroin
money through the bank.</p><p>In 1982 Archbishop Marcinkus was involved in a huge financial scandal
after an Italian bank collapsed. One of his business friends was found
hanged beneath a London bridge. And another colleague, who was in jail
on charges of murdering a police commissioner, died from drinking coffee
with cyanide. These were the people who could have been witnesses
against Archbishop Marcinkus; these two people knew all the secrets --
and both were killed.</p><p>A warrant for the arrest of the Archbishop had been issued, but the
Vatican is a separate government -- just eight square miles -- and the
Italian government has no power to interfere in the Vatican. And the
pope was hiding the man inside the Vatican; the arrest warrant was
waiting outside. These are your religious leaders.</p><p>The Polack pope also strongly reprimanded priests around the world
for their involvement in politics, but he himself ordered one hundred
million dollars of Vatican money to go to the Solidarity group in Poland
who were fighting the communist government.</p><p>I am against organized religion because the moment anything becomes
organized, it has its own vested interest. Then religion is forgotten --
other things become more important. Truth and the search for truth need
your total involvement; nothing else should be in the way.</p><p>Organized religion becomes a prison. It gives you ready-made
doctrines, and your only function is to believe in them -- whether they
are reasonable, logical, or not. You are not supposed to experiment on
your own because, who knows? -- you may find something which goes
against the official doctrine.</p><p>But official doctrine cannot become your enlightenment. The official
doctrine can make you learned, scholarly -- but it cannot make you wise,
it cannot make you intuitive, it cannot make you aware of God.</p><p>I am criticizing the pope because he is not only the head of an
organized religion, but also the head of a government. It is not much of
a government, eight square miles, but still, he is being accepted as
head of a country; he has his representatives in the U.N.; he has his
ambassadors in different countries.</p><p>Religion is something so high, and politics is so low that one thing
has to be remembered: whenever there is a mixture of something lower
with something higher, it is always the higher which becomes polluted --
not the lower. It is always the higher which loses its quality of being
higher. The lower has nothing to lose; it cannot fall any more -- it has
already fallen to its uttermost.</p><p>Religion and politics should be separate.</p><p>And the moment religion becomes organized, it becomes politics. Hence
religion should not be organized at all; it should be everybody's
private, personal, intimate search.</p><p>At least some area of life should be left to the individual where he
is totally free, without anybody else deciding for him, where he can
open his wings like an eagle and fly across the sun -- no chains, no
bondages, no hindrances.</p><p>Religion blossoms only in a heart which is absolutely free of all
doctrines, all beliefs, all churches, all mosques.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 94</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>I want the whole world to be religious but not Christian, not
Catholic, not Hindu, not Mohammedan. Just to be religious is enough.</p><p>Can't you see these simple facts? Honesty is honesty -- it is neither
Christian nor Hindu.</p><p>Truth is simply truth -- it cannot be Mohammedan, it cannot be
Christian. Love is simply love</p><p>-- it cannot be Eastern and it cannot be Western. Compassion is
compassion -- it</p><p>does not belong to any race, to any country, to any climate; it is
not dependent on any geography, or any history. These are the
ingredients of a religious consciousness.</p><p>Meditation is simply so scientific that just as you accept physics
without bothering about whether it is Hindu or Mohammedan, you accept
chemistry without ever thinking whether it is Protestant or Catholic...
When you go to the doctor, you never bother whether the medicine is
Hindu or Buddhist.</p><p>The inner reality is simply a pure silence: thousands of flowers
blossom there but they don't belong to any organization. They are the
reward of your own search, of your own inward-going.</p><p>All the organized religions care basically depriving humanity of
religion because they are misdirecting you. They are always directing
you outwards -- their God is far away in the sky.</p><p>And when you pray, folding your hands towards the sky, you don't
realize that there is nobody to hear you.</p><p>In fact, the one who is praying, the one who is alive in you, the one
who is breathing in you, is the God.</p><p>You have just to discover it.</p><p>It is hidden in the layers of your false personality. Find out, in
your innocence, and life becomes a sheer joy, a song without words, a
dance, a celebration.</p><p>And at the very end of your celebration, there is nothing but tears
of gratitude. I cannot think or conceive that those tears of gratitude
belong to any religion. They belong to the individual heart, overflowing
with gratefulness towards existence.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER MORNING BEFORE LECTURE, I SUDDENLY FELT AN OVERWHELMING
URGE TO TOUCH, WITH GREAT GRATITUDE, THE</p><p>FLOOR</p><p>WHERE YOU WALK. IN THAT MOMENT, I HEARD AGAIN THAT VOICE</p><p>-- IT STILL</p><p>SOUNDS LIKE YOUR VOICE: "IF YOU CAN KISS IN GRATITUDE THE PLACE
ON</p><p>EARTH WHERE I HAVE STEPPED... I WANT TO TELL YOU, THAT I'VE
STEPPED</p><p>EVERYWHERE ON THIS EARTH. "THIS IS REALLY TOO MUCH, FOR I SEE
MYSELF</p><p>IN TEARS, KISSING EVERY SPOT ON THE EARTH. AND AGAIN THAT VOICE</p><p>COMES IN ME, OR FROM ME, WHISPERING, "IF YOU CAN KISS IN
GRATITUDE</p><p>ALL THE EARTH, AND ALL THAT ABIDES ON THE EARTH, YOU DON'T NEED
ME</p><p>ANYMORE. "PLEASE, OSHO, TELL ME THAT I WAS JUST IMAGINING, THAT
IT</p><p>WAS JUST A DREAM. YOU HAVEN'T SAID THAT TO ME, HAVE YOU?</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 95</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>Sarjano, the idea is Catholic. You come from the country of the pope,
and that fellow goes on kissing the earth wherever he goes -- even in
India, where kissing the earth means kissing cow dung. When he kissed it
here, that very day I said, "He has tasted something of Hindu
religion."</p><p>It is just your imagination, Sarjano. There is no need for your
gratitude to be</p><p>expressed in stupid gestures. Just being grateful, your eyes full of
tears, your heart just melting and merging with existence, is enough.
Kissing the earth is just an idiotic symbol; I could never have said
anything like this to you. But you love me, and you are so full of me
that even if you speak in your imagination, you may hear my voice.</p><p>But remember one thing: except for silence, everything else is your
imagination</p><p>--</p><p>howsoever beautiful. Only your silence I can say has my support,
because only in your silence are you close to the very center of
existence. In absolute silence, you become the very center yourself. But
remember to avoid any kind of imagination -- all imagination -- even
beautiful imagination, apparently looking like the divine.</p><p>It happened once: I had a few Mohammedan friends and they were
followers of a Sufi mystic. The mystic used to come to the city once a
year to see his disciples, and they were continuously telling me, "This
time when he comes, some way has to be found so that you both can
meet."</p><p>I said, "There is no problem with it. I can be his host; he can be my
guest. That will be the best thing because he is going to be here three
days, so for three days we can be together."</p><p>They liked the idea. The most impressive thing to them in the Sufi
mystic was that he saw God everywhere: he would see a tree and he would
go and hug the tree and start talking to the tree. Almost in a trance,
he would kiss the earth; he would hold your hand and kiss it and he
would start talking in a trance and address you as "God! My Lord!"
People were very impressed.</p><p>He came to stay with me. Before he could kiss my hand, I said, "Wait!
Do you really see God in me or have you been imagining for years?" --
because that is one of the traditions in the Sufis: you start imagining
and slowly, slowly, the imagination becomes a reality.</p><p>He was shocked. There was a moment of silence -- painful silence,
because his disciples were there. But he was an honest man; he said,
"Ah, at least thirty years ago I started on the path, and this was the
path shown by my teacher: 'Look into everything for God.'</p><p>"In the beginning, it was difficult to see God in a camel, in a
donkey, in a buffalo. But my master insisted: All these forms are gods;
you don't have to judge them -- your path is just to see God in
everything, so that one day you can see God everywhere. And I succeeded
in three years, and I started seeing God everywhere. Now I see God
everywhere."</p><p>I said, "Just listen to me. For the three days you will be here, stop
imagining. Just see things as they are: a table is a table, not God; a
camel is a camel, not God; and a buffalo is a buffalo, not God -- just
for three days."</p><p>He was very reluctant and afraid and nervous, but he was staying with
me, so I said, "I will remind you about this kissing and hugging --
don't forget! After three days you can hug with a vengeance, because no
tree can prevent how much you hug it. For three days... you can fill the
quota afterwards, but for three days I will be constantly after you. You
have to see things as they are."</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 96</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>There was no need for three days. Within just one day, in twenty-four
hours, the god that had been there for thirty years, disappeared. In the
morning, he was very angry at me. He said,</p><p>"What have you done? I really see a table is a table! Just now I saw
a man going by on a bicycle, and I saw neither the god in the man, nor
in the bicycle. You destroyed my thirty years of practice."</p><p>I said, "Just think a little. If something that you have spent thirty
years discovering was really true, then in one day it could not
disappear. For thirty years you have lived in a hallucination -- you
created the hallucination, and the hallucination can be so strong that
all doubts disappear. And thirty years is a long time."</p><p>I told him a story of Ramakrishna which is very rare in the history
of mystics. After attaining enlightenment, nobody ever tries to look
into other paths to see whether they also reach to enlightenment or not
-- there is no point. You wanted to reach here, you have reached</p><p>-- now what is the point of finding out whether other roads also
reach here or not? But Ramakrishna had something tremendously
significant on his mind, so he gave six months to each religion that was
available in his vicinity; for six months he would practice the religion
and forget everything else. Of course, he was already enlightened so the
path was not a problem; in six months, he would reach back to the point
of consciousness.</p><p>In Bengal, there is a small local group of a very strange religion:
they believe that Krishna is the only man, and those who follow him are
all women. They may be men, but that is only an illusion; in reality,
except for Krishna, there is no other man -- all are women. He is the
lover and you are the beloved. In the night, the followers of that sect,
men and women both, dress alike -- like women. And even men sleep with a
statue of Krishna in their beds -- he is their husband.</p><p>Ramakrishna followed that path also for six months. For others it was
just a ritual; they were born into that religion, just as you are born
into Christianity, or Hinduism, or Jainism.</p><p>You don't really care; it is just accidental that you are born into a
certain religion and you follow it, but it is a formality -- at the
most.</p><p>But Ramakrishna was not going into those processes in a formal way:
when he was following something, he was following it with totality and
intensity. And almost a miracle was seen! Even in the day, he used the
same clothes as women use in Bengal. Even the people of that sect told
him, "In the day you can use men's clothes; otherwise it looks very
awkward."</p><p>But he said, "When I follow something, I follow it totally. I cannot
divide my day from my night. And I don't care about the world."</p><p>His breasts started growing; his disciples became very much afraid.
So much intensity of projecting that even the doctors who came to know
about it when they visited Ramakrishna and saw his breasts, could not
believe it -- because this was a physiological miracle. But his
disciples whispered in the ears of the doctor, "This is nothing -- he is
having monthly periods!"</p><p>For six months continuously... his voice changed, it became more like
a woman's. He started walking like a woman -- which is very difficult;
difficult because only a woman can walk that way. She has a womb inside
her body and that womb gives a different kind of movement to the legs.
Man has no womb</p><p>inside; his legs have a different movement.</p><p>He started walking like a woman, speaking like a woman, his voice
changed. And when the menstrual period started, then the disciples
became really afraid. They said, "We have lost Osho - The Hidden
Splendor</p><p>97</p><p>Chapter 9 - Papal politics: organized superstition</p><p>him. How can we get him back?" They tried to persuade him, but until
six months was up, he was not going to change his path. They said, "This
path is dangerous. We don't think that these breasts and this period are
going to disappear even after six months. Your whole life you will be a
laughingstock -- and we are going to be laughingstocks because we are
your disciples."</p><p>It took almost six months after he stopped for the change to take
place again. Slowly, slowly, he became a man again -- before that he had
become a woman. Such a deep psychological projection... It is through
such projections that people are experiencing Krishna, Jesus, Buddha --
and when they experience it, they see it.</p><p>And if you say to them that it is only an illusion, how can they
believe you? Their illusion looks more real than you are. Mind has a
capacity to project anything and make it appear almost real; or
sometimes, if the mind is very powerful, even more than real.</p><p>But my path is not the path of imagination: It is the path that does
not use the mind at all.</p><p>Imagination and projection and hallucination and illusion -- they are
all parts of the mind.</p><p>My simple approach is transcendence of mind; so only when you start
seeing absolute nothingness, utter silence, can you see that I am very
close by.</p><p>In that silence, you have heard me; in that nothingness, you have
seen me. But if you see something, if you hear something, then it is
your imagination -- you have fallen from the beyond, back into the
mind.</p><p>Only one thing has to be remembered: the mind is the world -- and
going beyond the mind is the beginning of God.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 98</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

-- my hit gives you dignity. It is a recognition of your strength, your integrity, your centeredness.

‌Chapter 10 - Enlightenment is not an experience‌ no obstacle to it -- no experience, no object -- it moves back, and the subject itself becomes the object.
That&#39;s what J. Krishnamurti, for his whole life, continued to say: that when the observer becomes the observed, know that you have arrived.
Before that, there are thousands of things in the way. The body gives its own experiences, which have become known as the experiences of the centers of kundalini; seven centers become seven lotus flowers.</description>

‌Chapter 10 - Enlightenment is not an experience‌ you are moving and for what. You go on living because everybody else is living, but without any consciousness.
Why? Why should you wake up tomorrow morning and still go on breathing? Your whole past proves that it has been nothing but an exercise in futility, and you know perfectly well you will be repeating it as long as you are alive -- unless by accident, you come across a man who is awake.</description>

‌Chapter 10 - Enlightenment is not an experience‌ The gaps between valleys are not your creation. The valleys that you create are so painful that you cannot tolerate them continuously. Once in awhile you want to be alone, and when you are alone you again feel fresh.
But just look at your logic: You are consoling yourself that these deep valleys of darkness are cleansing you.</description>

They would tell him where to attack and where not to attack, and that was the reason that for five years he went on winning -- because the other side was following military science.</description>

I say, &#34;To err is human and to forgive is also human.&#34; And to forgive oneself is one of the greatest virtues, because if you cannot forgive yourself, you cannot forgive anybody else in the world -- it is impossible.</description>

‌Chapter 16 - Love is always an emperor‌ It was unfortunate that Mahavira and Gautam Buddha both used the word nonviolence. I can understand their difficulty. Their difficulty was that by &#34;love&#34; people understand biological love; to avoid that misunderstanding they used a negative term: nonviolence.

It only knows to give. It never even imagines, expects, anything in return.
Be more meditative, become more conscious of your being. Let your inner world become more silent, and love will be flowing through you. People have all these problems. The problems are different -- violence, jealousy, misery, anxiety -- but the medicine for all these illnesses is only one, and it is meditation.</description>

‌Chapter 27 - Harmony is your reality‌ quality. Right now you may not be able even to imagine them, because unless you experience something, you cannot imagine it, you cannot dream about it.
This is the very beginning of the journey on the path, but a very beautiful opening. If you don&#39;t come in the way, many more experiences will follow.
So the only thing to avoid is yourself coming in the way.</description>

‌Chapter 27 - Harmony is your reality‌ Rinzai said, &#34;I was sitting silent. That is the essential part of my teaching. I thought that rather than talking about it, it would be better to show it to you. In words, things get distorted; in words, you start interpreting according to your own prejudices.&#34;
The man said, &#34;It is beyond me. Please give some words that I can remember.</description>

‌Chapter 27 - Harmony is your reality‌ It all depends on you. If you don&#39;t try to find it again, it will be very easy. If you try to find it again, you will make it more and more difficult. The more you try, the less is the possibility.
The American idea of &#34;try and try and try again&#34; will not help. It is good for the outside world; for the inside world, don&#39;t try.</description>

And he has used the marble with such artfulness that you can feel both things -- the strength of Jesus and the fragileness. And the tears are in the eyes of Jesus&#39; mother, Mary.</description>

‌Chapter 27 - Harmony is your reality‌ the trees. We are spread all over. To experience it as reality will transform your whole approach towards life, will transform your every act, will transform your very being.
You will become full of love; you will become full of reverence for life. You will become for the first time, according to me, truly religious -- not a Christian, not a Hindu, not a Mohammedan, but truly, purely religious.</description>

‌Chapter 8 - The taste of your being‌ 8 The taste of your being
16 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1
BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS RELIGION? WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON ORGANIZED RELIGION?
Anand Maitreya, religion is the highest flight of human consciousness -- it is the individual search for truth.
The inner truth cannot be made an object of common knowledge.</description>

‌Chapter 8 - The taste of your being‌ As your watcher becomes stronger, thoughts become less -- in the same proportion. If the watcher is ten percent of your energy, then ninety percent of your energy is wasted in thoughts; if your watcher becomes ninety percent, then only ten percent remains in thoughts.
The moment you are one hundred percent a watcher, the mind becomes empty.</description>

‌Chapter 8 - The taste of your being‌ One sometimes feels so amazed... it seems unbelievable, that even in the twentieth century the pope could declare, a few months ago, that to communicate with God directly is a sin. You should go through the priest, the right channel -- because if people start going directly to God, confessing to God, praying to God, the millions of priests will be unemployed.</description>

‌Chapter 8 - The taste of your being‌ is now Christianity, and to pay respect to the pope means all the votes of the Christians will be yours.
Organized religions -- whether it is Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism -- have not been seekers of truth. In two thousand years, what truth has organized Christianity added to the statements of Jesus? So what is the need of this organization?</description>

I said, &#34;If you snore, then I will snore loudly. I cannot snore while I am asleep; so I have to pretend that I am asleep; and I will snore loudly unless you stop your snoring. If you don&#39;t snore, there is no problem: there is a lot of space here, and I am going on my way after just two hours.</description>

People are miserable. Help them to laugh a little, to sing a little, to dance a little.
I don&#39;t want missionaries. You are not to spread my teachings -- I don&#39;t have any anyway --</description>

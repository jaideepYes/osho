Have you forgotten that just a second more, and you would not have been alive? It is because of your wife -- the whole credit goes to her.\"\nBut it was a conspiracy. The East cannot think of such things. Mohammed Gauri imprisoned Prithviraj -- and Prithviraj was the greatest archer of those times. The first thing Mohammed Gauri did: he took both of Prithviraj's eyes out.\nPrithviraj's friend was also captured with him -- he was a poet. Prithviraj told him, \"You come with me to the court. Nobody understands our language, and I don't need eyes to hit my target -- you just describe how far he is.\"\nMohammed Gauri was so afraid of Prithviraj that he was not sitting on his usual throne, he was sitting on the balcony; the whole court was on the ground floor. And Chandrabardai, the poet, described exactly how many feet high, how many feet away. \"Mohammed Gauri was sitting...\" He sang it in a song, and blind Prithviraj killed Mohammed Gauri just through that description. His arrow reached exactly to his heart.\nBut Chandrabardai was very much puzzled, because in Prithviraj's blind eyes there were tears. Prithviraj said, \"It is not right of me, but he has forced to do me something which goes against our whole tradition.\"\nThe East has a totally different approach towards things. If the West learns something about the East, the most important thing will be that all that is great comes out of non-doing, non-aggressiveness -- because every act is potentially aggressive. Only when you are in a state of non-doing are you non-aggressive. You are receptive, and in that receptivity, the whole existence pours all its treasures into you.\nR.D. Laing's question is perfectly significant. Chidananda, send my answer to him also. He has been reading my books; he knows me perfectly well. And he has influenced in the Western psychological field; he is perhaps the most influential and most original figure today.\nIf he makes it a point, he can spread -- rather than psychological,\npsychoanalytical, and psychiatric ideas -- what the West needs: a deep understanding of meditation, of non-doing and of allowing existence to take its own course.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 140\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device 14\nNo time left for any device\n19 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE\nWORLD RUNNING FAST TOWARDS A DEAD END, WITHOUT SHOWING ANY\nMORE HOPE THAT THINGS WILL EVER CHANGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, UP TO\nONE MONTH AGO, YOU TALKED ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRESENCE OF\nTWO HUNDRED ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE, OR EVEN ONE, COULD SAVE THE\nWORLD. WHY THIS SHIFT OF EMPHASIS? DID YOU GIVE UP ON THE OTHER\nPOSSIBILITY? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THAT\nMADE YOUR VISION CHANGE?\nChidananda, it is true that I have been talking a lot about the world running fast towards a dead end. The reason is, factually it is running towards an end. But it was running towards its end before, too. Now I want it to be absolutely emphasized on your consciousness, so that you stop postponing your own transformation. Man's mind is so stupid that if there is a little possibility to postpone, then he will postpone for tomorrow -- unless he comes to a dead-end street where there is no way to go forward and he has to take an absolute about- turn.\nBut things in the world are not visible to you. You may go on sleeping and the world may die. It is urgent that you take it seriously that the world may not be there tomorrow. You don't have time to waste for anything else other than your own awakening.\nI still know if there are two hundred enlightened people in the world, the world can be saved; but I have never told you that just one enlightened man can save the world. It is a heavy load. One single enlightened man cannot carry it; two hundred is the minimum. But from where to bring those two hundred people? They have to be born amongst you -- you have to become those two hundred people. And your growth is so slow, there is every fear that before you become enlightened the world will be gone.\nYou are not putting your total energy into meditation, into awareness. It is one of the things that you are doing, amongst many; and it is not even the first priority of your life. I want it to become your first priority. The only way is that I should emphasize, deeply into your consciousness, that the world is going to end soon.\nAnd if you are not awakened before its end, you will be lost in a long journey, because evolution will start from the very beginning on some other planet. On this planet it took four billion years for man to arrive. His life began in the ocean as a fish. On another planet, if this planet is destroyed, life will continue, but it will have to begin from the very beginning -- and after four billion years you may be again a human being. It is a great risk to take.\nNothing has changed in the world; everything is going exactly in the direction of\ndeath -- a little faster of course -- and the moment of total annihilation is coming very close. It all Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n141\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\ndepends on what your priorities are. If being awakened has become your priority, and you are ready to sacrifice everything for it, then there is hope.\nI have told you the ancient story in the Old Testament -- but that will not help today, the situation is so different. In the Old Testament there is a story about two big cities almost the same size as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The names of those two cities were Sodom and Gomorrah. The people of those two cities had become so perverted, they were doing all kinds of unnatural, psychopathological actions. Their sexuality had totally gone astray. Those two places must have been the California of the Old Testament.\nThe story is that God tried hard to change those people. But to change anyone is a difficult task, even for a god -- because the very idea that somebody is trying to change you creates a resistance, even if the change is for your good, even if there is no vested interest for the person who is trying to change you. But the very idea that somebody is trying to change you creates an unconscious resistance not to change.\nFinally, God gave up the idea and decided to destroy those two cities because their very existence was dangerous. They could spread all their diseases to the whole of humanity.\nSodom was so perverted that people were making love to animals; hence the word sodomy.\nGomorrah had gone completely homosexual; heterosexuality had completely stopped.\nAccording to the Old Testament, God destroyed those two cities completely; but there is another version from Hassid mystics.\nJudaism has produced one of the most essential lines of mystics, the Hassids. The orthodox Jews don't accept them -- the orthodox can never accept the\nreligious. But every organized religion has produced, on the margin, a rebellious group which is not organized, which has different interpretations and a different style of life. Hassidism is one of the most beautiful ways to find oneself and to find the reality of existence.\nThe Hassids have a different version because they cannot accept God destroying two cities; there must be some way to save them. Their story is that when God became determined to destroy them, one Hassid approached God and asked him one question: \"You are going to destroy these two great cities, but have you ever wondered that there may be, in both cities, two hundred good people? They will also be destroyed, and this will not be a good precedent.\nJust for the sake of those two hundred, you have to change your decision.\"\nGod thought for a moment and he said, \"I never looked at this side. Certainly there may be good people and they will be destroyed with the bad. No, if you can prove that there are two hundred good people, I will not destroy those two cities.\"\nThe Hassid said, \"But suppose there are not two hundred, but only twenty -- ten in each city. Will you destroy those good people? Does quantity mean so much to you, and not quality? What does it matter whether there are two hundred good people or twenty good people?\"\nGod had to concede to the argument of the Hassid. He said, \"Of course. Prove that there are twenty good people.\"\nThe Hassid said, \"And if there is only one good man who lives six months in one city and six months in another city, what is your idea? Will you destroy those cities? Will it be a godly action? Ninety-nine percent of the people can be destroyed, if they are evil, for the one percent of good people; but one percent of good people cannot be destroyed to save the ninety-nine percent of evil people.\"\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 142\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nGod said, \"You are very persuasive. Okay, show me, where is the good man?\"\nThe Hassid said, \"I am the good man, and I live six months in one city to help people transform their ways of life, and six months in another city for the same purpose. What is your decision? Are you going to destroy me too? Is not one good man more valuable, has he not more weight than thousands of evil people?\" And according to the Hassidic story, God had to concede not to destroy those two cities. Orthodox Jews don't believe in the story because it is not written in the Old Testament. The story may be a fiction, but I say unto you, it is truer than any truth. It may not be written in the Old Testament, but its logic is so clear that it cannot be false. It may not be historical, but it has a spiritual reality.\nIn the same way I have been telling you that two hundred enlightened people can save the world. Existence is very generous; it cannot destroy two hundred awakened people, who have reached to the highest peak of consciousness -- which has taken four billion years of evolution. But you have to become those two hundred people! To wake you up, I have been insisting that the end is very close. And this time it is not a parable.\nJesus used it as a device, that the end of the world is very close and the last judgment day is very close. His disciples asked him at the time of his departure -\n- before the enemies got hold of him and when it was certain that he would be crucified the next day, their last question was, \"When will we be seeing you again?\" He said, \"In this very life, because the end of the world is very close -- but do what I have told you.\"\nAnd even Christians don't know what he has told them. The last night before he was caught they were in the mountains and he told his disciples, \"This may be the last night we are together, and I am going to do my prayer. While I am praying behind the bush you should remain awake. It is absolutely essential, to support my prayer, that you are awake. Don't fall asleep.\"\nIn the middle of his prayer he came back -- and almost all were fast asleep. He woke them up and said, \"Have you not heard me? I had told you, you have to remain awake. Can't you remain awake just one night? -- because I will not be here with you again. Even my death tomorrow cannot help you to remain awake?\" They were very sorry. They said they would try, and he went again. This went on four, five times -- he would come back and they would all be fast asleep.\nAccording to me this was his last teaching: to remain awake. But Christianity\nhas completely forgotten about it. And I have not seen a single commentary by Christians on the implications of why Jesus was so insistently saying, \"Be awake!\" He was trying his hardest because once he was gone, there was every possibility they would all fall asleep, just as the whole of humanity is asleep, and they would start doing in their dreams things that are not to be done. But things that are not to be done can be prevented only when you are aware, alert.\nHis last teaching was awareness, but the disciples failed him -- not only those twelve intimate disciples failed him, for two thousand years all his disciples have failed him. The very word \"awareness\" has disappeared from the Christian idea of transforming human beings. Jesus was continually saying, \"The end is very close.\" That was a device -- because if you feel that there is enough time, why not sleep a little more? What is the hurry? But if there is no time left at all, perhaps the shock of it may wake you up.\nWhat was only a device to Jesus, to me is not a device. It is a reality. The world is going to end.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 143\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nI have been giving you hope, because I have to do two things: on the one hand I have to make it clear to you that the world is coming to its final suicide; and on the other hand, I have to give you the hope that still there is a possibility at least for you to become awakened.\nYour awakening is of tremendous importance; it has never been so important before --\nneither with Jesus nor with Gautam Buddha -- because there was enough time. Time has run out. We are at the fag end of time.\nTo make you aware of the reality -- so that you can make some effort to remain awake, to make some effort to be more conscious and not to get lost in trivia -- is absolutely necessary.\nThat's why my insistence will go on growing, because every day the end is\napproaching closer.\nMan is so asleep he is almost in a coma, and all his actions are arising out of this state of coma -- otherwise, there is no necessity for the world to end. But we are carrying nuclear weapons within our souls. The end is going to come because of our own ignorance, our own deep sleep.\nI have heard... a Polack is crossing the Sahara desert on a camel. After two months alone with the camel, and dreaming of beautiful women, he starts to find the camel attractive and decides to make love to her. But as soon as he is ready, the camel stands up, walks a few feet away and stops. The Polack tries again, but again the camel stands up, walks a few feet away and stops. The Polack tries again and again with no luck.\nOne day he finds the remains of a plane which has crashed in the desert, and just nearby a young woman, unconscious, but still alive. For days he takes care of her and she recovers totally. One morning she comes to him, looking her prettiest, hugs him and tells him how thankful she is to him for saving her life. \"You have been so sweet with me,\" she says, \"and I like you so much that I'll do anything for you.\"\nLooking at her beautiful face, the man says, \"Would you really?\" \"Yes,\" she says.\n\"Oh, I really appreciate that,\" replies the Polack. \"Would you mind holding that camel for me please?\"\nSuch is the situation of humanity. At least you have to come out of it -- and you need a constant hitting on your head to remind you that the times are no longer ordinary. And there have never been, in the whole history of man, such dangerous moments as those through which we are passing. It is no time for quarreling, arguing about theological matters; it is not intelligent to console yourself that some miracle will happen and the world war will be postponed. It is not only the world war -- the attack is multidimensional.\nThe ecology of the earth is breaking down.\nThere are thousands of submarines moving around the earth in the ocean -- and each submarine is carrying nuclear weapons so powerful that even the whole\nenergy that was used in the second world war is nothing compared to the energy of one submarine carrying nuclear missiles. The Soviet Union has its own submarines; America has its own submarines. Just by accident two submarines can collide, and the whole life on the planet will evaporate into smoke. And the politicians of the world are continually piling up more and more nuclear weapons.\nThe population of the world is growing so fast that just the growth of population will be enough to kill half of humanity out of hunger and thirst.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 144\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nSexual perversions have become so rampant that Gomorrah and Sodom look very outdated.\nTen million people around the earth already have AIDS -- which has no cure. And this number of ten million people is not accurate, because many countries have not yet declared how many people there have AIDS; they don't have any way to find it out. For example India is not aware how many people are suffering from AIDS. Mohammedan countries are bound to have a very large number of people suffering from AIDS, because homosexuality has been there for thousands of years.\nEven according to very moderate estimates, by the end of this century there will be one hundred million people suffering from AIDS. And when one hundred million people suffer from AIDS, that means at least one billion people must have been involved in homosexuality.\nThese are the multi-dimensional ways that death is approaching the earth.\nBecause we have cut so many forests, a thick layer of carbon dioxide has gathered on top of our atmosphere, miles away from the earth, where the air ends. The layer is so thick that it has already increased the temperature more than it has ever been on the earth; and that rise of temperature is melting the ice of the north and south poles. If that ice goes on melting -- and there is no way to prevent it -- all the oceans of the world will rise four feet higher. And all your\nbig cities are ports; they will be flooded with water, will become unlivable.\nIf this carbon dioxide becomes a little thicker, then the Himalayas and the Alps, which have eternal snow which has never melted, will start melting. The Himalayas alone have so much ice that if it melts completely, it will raise all the oceans of the world forty feet higher.\nAll your cities will be drowned, and this is not a flood that is going to recede.\nOne of the most dangerous things happening is that carbon dioxide is going to accumulate more and more. The trees go on inhaling carbon dioxide. If you cut the trees you are cutting two things: the supply of oxygen for your life, and the place for carbon dioxide to be absorbed. It is a double-edged sword -- and absolutely unnecessary.\nMan has been trying to reach to the moon and to Mars, and before that, we were never aware that where the air ends, miles above earth... all around the earth there is a thick layer of a certain gas, ozone, O3, which is a very protective layer. Because of that ozone, life has been possible on earth. That ozone has only one function: it does not allow any sunrays which are destructive to life; it returns them. It allows only those rays which are life-giving.\nBecause of our rockets moving towards the moon and towards Mars, we have made holes, for the first time, in the layer of ozone. Now those holes are allowing in all the rays of the sun towards the earth -- and death-rays are also included.\nSo when I say the end is not very far away, it is not like when Jesus says it -- just a device.\nBy the end of this century, you will see all these dimensions bringing death to you. It has to be emphasized: unless you become absolutely clear about death, you are not going to concentrate your whole energy on transforming your being.\nPeople change with difficulty; they find it easier to remain as they are -- just like stones, like rocks. Change means a determined effort, a commitment to transform your energies, to take your being in an absolutely serious manner -- it has not to be wasted in stupid things.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor\n145\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nA famous playboy dies, and his best friends decide to celebrate with a mourning party.\nLate in the night someone suggests calling Hell in order to find out where he is. \"But how can you call Hell?\" someone asks.\n\"Well,\" the man answers, \"I guess it is just a long distance call.\"\nSo they check the telephone book and find out all about outer space calls and then dial Hell. A few seconds later a very hoarse voice answers, \"This is Hell. What do you want?\"\nTerrified by the devilish voice, they say, \"We are looking for a friend.\" \"What is his name?\"\n\"Peter Thompson.\"\n\"He is not here.\" And the devil hangs up.\nTotally amazed and having dropped all reference to logic, they decide to call Purgatory.\nThey dial Purgatory, and to their relief, the voice on the phone does not sound so terrible --\nmore businesslike. They explain that they are looking for a dead friend who is not in Hell and who just died.\n\"Well,\" the voice answers, \"he is not here, either. Try Heaven.\" \"But he was a playboy!\" his friends reply.\n\"He has to be somewhere. Try Heaven.\"\nSo they dial Heaven, and a heavenly voice answers very softly and slowly, \"Hello. This is Heaven. This is Virgin Mary. Can I help you?\"\nVery shy, they explain the whole story.\n\"No,\" says the beautiful voice, full of echo: \"He is not here. Thank you for calling. Call again.\"\nSo every day they call Heaven, and every day they get the same answer. So they call again and again; and one week later, on Sunday morning, a very sexy, foxy, quick voice answers,\n\"Hey, this is Mary. What do you want, guys...?\"\nLooking at each other and laughing, the friends agree: \"He has arrived!\"\nChange is very difficult. A playboy will be a playboy, whether he is in hell or in heaven; he will go on doing his repetitive style of life.\nBeing alert means you have to stop being robots. Change your routines, move more consciously; let every act become an object of awareness. Then even these few years that are left are enough -- more than enough. If you put your total energy into transformation, the destruction of the earth will not be your destruction. If you can die consciously, you have found the key to a higher life, to an eternal life, to a divine life.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS THIS UNDERCURRENT OF GIGGLING IN MY HEART EVERY TIME I FEEL THAT YOU ARE USING THE WHOLE WORLD AS A DEVICE FOR OUR\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 146\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nGROWTH, AND THAT YOU ARE USING US AS A DEVICE FOR THE WHOLE\nWORLD? WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nSarjano, you will have to stop your giggling in the heart. This is not a device. There is no time left for any device at all. Your giggling is simply a rationalization: you don't want to believe that the world is going to end because you don't want to change. You want me to say to you that this is only a device, so that you can relax -- relax in your fixed pattern of life. But I cannot lie to you.\nWhen I use something as a device, I tell you it is a device. But this is not a device, either to transform the world through you or to change you through the world. I am simply stating a very sad fact. Your giggling is nothing but an effort to erase the impact which I am trying to create.\nGiggle about everything else, but not about your transformation. That giggling is your unconscious trying to deceive you, telling you something or other will happen, so you need not worry.\nThe unconscious does not want to disappear. Your unconscious is nine times more than your conscious; it is nine times more powerful too. And you have to be very alert not to be caught in the powerful unconscious; otherwise, it will close all the doors, all the possibilities, all the potentialities of transformation.\nI am in absolute support of your giggling about everything in the world except the transformation that is needed within you. And the problem is that you are very serious about everything in the world, and only nonserious about your own interiority.\nDuring his world tour, the Polack pope arrives in America. When he comes out of the plane, there is a big crowd standing on the runway waving flags, shouting, \"Elvis, Elvis!\"\nThe pope looks at them, full of holiness, kisses the ground and says mildly, \"My children, look: I am not Elvis, I am the pope.\"\nHe enters the airport hall and notices a mass of people standing there, dancing, waving flags and shouting at him: \"Elvis, Elvis!\"\nA little bit indignant, he blesses the people, and very softly he says, \"Oh no, my dear sheep, I am not Elvis, I am the pope.\"\nLater on, when he finally reaches his hotel, he can't believe his eyes: in the lobby, hundreds of people are crowded, waving flags, yelling, \"Elvis, Elvis!\"\nA little bit puzzled now, he puts his hands together, makes a cross, smiles as divinely as possible and announces, \"No, my beloved little lambs. No, I am not Elvis, I am the pope.\"\nCentered again, he goes upstairs to his suite, opens the door and suddenly sees two beautiful naked women are lying in his bed, waving little flags, shouting ecstatically at him,\n\"Elvis, Elvis!\"\nImmediately, jumping out of his clothes, he starts singing, \"You ain't nothing but a hound-dog...\"\nYour unconscious is always there, so powerful that if it gets any chance -- pope or no pope\n-- the unconscious will be the winner. You have to make your consciousness so strong that the unconscious slowly, slowly becomes weaker and finally dies. That's the meaning of the Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n147\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nenlightened man: one whose unconsciousness has disappeared, whose whole being is full of consciousness.\nWhatever I am saying, it is my absolutely clear vision that the world is very close to its end. Don't giggle it away. Don't find rationalizations; they won't help.\nThere is no time to waste in any unconscious consolations. An immediate transformation is absolutely needed; it is an urgency which man has never faced before. In a way, you are unfortunate that soon there will be no future. In another way, you are very fortunate because this crisis is so big -- perhaps it may help you to wake up.\nQuestion 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nOFTEN, WHEN I COME TO SEE YOU I WANT SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION: A SIGN THAT YOU SEE ME, THAT YOU KNOW I EXIST\n-- A LOOK, A HAND\nGESTURE, PERHAPS TO ANSWER A QUESTION. YOU NEVER RESPOND TO THIS.\nFEELING THE TENSION AND PAIN THIS LONGING CAUSES IN ME, I CRY AND\nTHEN RELAX. AN OPENING IS THERE AND YOU LOOK MY WAY. OSHO, MUST I ALWAYS GO THROUGH THIS WAY OF PAIN AND TEARS TO REACH MY INNER\nBEING? I AM JEWISH BY CONDITIONING -- COULD THAT BE PART OF IT?\nPrem Indivar, that explains everything -- that you are Jewish by conditioning. But your question may be the question of many others.\nYou say, \"Often when I come to see You I want some kind of recognition.\" This is one of the sicknesses of our souls. The whole existence recognizes you -- the birds by their songs, the trees by their flowers, the sun by its rays, the moon by its beauty -- they are all recognizing you. Just you have forgotten. You want recognition in a human way; perhaps in language.\nExistence is silent, its recognition is silent.\nAll that you have to know is to be silent to understand the recognition.\nAs far as I am concerned, I have given you recognition just by initiating you on the path of mysticism. I have not asked whether you are worthy or not, whether you deserve or not. I have recognized your potential spirituality without any examination, without any test.\nYou say \"... a sign that you see me, that you know I exist -- a look, a hand gesture, perhaps to answer a question.\" I know that you exist -- and my whole effort is that you should not exist; that's why I go on avoiding seeing you!\nBecause seeing you may give you energy and nourishment to exist, and that is not your true existence; that is your ego, you are suffering from an inferiority complex. I want you to drop this ego which is hungry for recognition. And the moment you drop it, immediately you will find there is recognition.\nYou say, \"You never respond to this. Feeling the tension and pain this longing causes in me, I cry and then relax.\" If you have carefully understood your own question, it has the answer: You cry and then relax. \"An opening is there and you look my way.\"\nIf you are relaxed the whole existence is tremendously happy. Not only am I looking at you, everything is looking at you. But the reason is your relaxation, the reason is your crying; Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n148\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\nyour tears cleanse you, your relaxation does not allow the ego to form. And you have come to know the secret -- that I look your way...\n\"Osho, must I always go through this way of pain and tears to reach my inner being?\" It all depends on you. If you love it, if you want it this way -- only then do you have to go through pain and tears. Otherwise you can go through laughter and singing and dancing. The whole question is that in pain and tears, or in singing and dancing, the ego disappears -- it is your choice.\nI have heard, a man noticed a signboard on a restaurant saying, \"You are welcome here, and you will feel absolutely at home. Come in; at least just give us one chance to serve you.\"\nThe man entered. The waitress came and he ordered four burnt chapatis. The waitress could not believe what he was saying -- \"Vegetable without any salt,\" and things like that. She said, \"Are you joking?\"\nHe said, \"No.\" So she went, burned the chapatis, and brought the plates, feeling very weird about the whole thing -- what kind of man is he? And then she asked, \"Anything more?\"\nHe said, \"Yes, sit across from me and nag.\"\nShe said, \"You seem to be a very strange fellow.\" He said, \"I am not a strange fellow --\njust in front of your door, you say 'You will feel at home,' and I want to feel at home. That's what happens in my home: burnt chapatis, vegetables without salt, everything wrong -- and finally my wife sitting across from me, nagging me. Because of her nagging, I cannot even say that the chapatis are burned, that there is no salt...\"\nIt is up to you: both are possibilities. You can relax through pain and tears... but that is not a good choice. You can relax through singing, dancing, rejoicing -- and relaxation will come.\nTry the other way.\nYou say, \"I am Jewish by conditioning. Could that be part of it?\" It certainly is. But once you have become a sannyasin, you are no longer Jewish. A sannyasin is simply a human being. Your conditioning is there, but rather than continuing the tears and pain, start singing and dancing. Even if it feels a little difficult in the beginning, the conditioning can be changed; you can be unconditioned.\nAt the conclusion of the physical exam, the doctor summoned his patient into his office with a very grave look on his face. \"I hate to be the one to break it to you, Fred,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid you have only got six months to live.\"\n\"Oh my god!\" gasped Fred, turning white. When the news had sunk in his heart he said,\n\"Listen, Doc, you have known me a long time. Do you have any suggestions as to how I could make the most of my remaining months?\"\n\"Have you ever been married?\" asked the doctor.\nFred explained that he had been a bachelor all his life. \"You might think about taking a wife,\" the doctor proposed. \"After all, you will need someone to look after you in the final illness.\"\n\"That's a good point, Doc,\" said Fred. \"And with only six months to live, I'd better make the most of my time.\"\n\"May I make one more suggestion?\" asked the doctor. When Fred nodded, he said, \"Marry a Jewish girl.\" Osho - The Hidden Splendor\n149\nChapter 14 - No time left for any device\n\"A Jewish girl -- how come?\" wondered Fred.\nThe doctor replied, \"Then six months will seem like six lives.\"\nIt is your choice, but my suggestion is: you have been married to Jewish conditioning; now get divorced. Just be a human being, rejoicing, dancing, singing. And if tears come they have to be of joy, of blissfulness, of peace, of silence. And the moment you feel relaxed, ecstasy will enter within your being from all sides. The whole existence will recognize you, not only me.\nEcstasy can be explained in other words:\nA recognition by the whole existence that you are needed, that you are beautiful, that without you existence will be poorer.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\nOsho - The Hidden Splendor 150\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5899","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/part51/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_hidden_splendor/>The Hidden Splendor</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 13 - Truth is not divisible</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5899 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Hidden_Splendor/part51.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part50>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Have
you forgotten that just a second more, and you would not have been
alive? It is because of your wife -- the whole credit goes to her."</p><p>But it was a conspiracy. The East cannot think of such things.
Mohammed Gauri imprisoned Prithviraj -- and Prithviraj was the greatest
archer of those times. The first thing Mohammed Gauri did: he took both
of Prithviraj's eyes out.</p><p>Prithviraj's friend was also captured with him -- he was a poet.
Prithviraj told him, "You come with me to the court. Nobody understands
our language, and I don't need eyes to hit my target -- you just
describe how far he is."</p><p>Mohammed Gauri was so afraid of Prithviraj that he was not sitting on
his usual throne, he was sitting on the balcony; the whole court was on
the ground floor. And Chandrabardai, the poet, described exactly how
many feet high, how many feet away. "Mohammed Gauri was sitting..." He
sang it in a song, and blind Prithviraj killed Mohammed Gauri just
through that description. His arrow reached exactly to his heart.</p><p>But Chandrabardai was very much puzzled, because in Prithviraj's
blind eyes there were tears. Prithviraj said, "It is not right of me,
but he has forced to do me something which goes against our whole
tradition."</p><p>The East has a totally different approach towards things. If the West
learns something about the East, the most important thing will be that
all that is great comes out of non-doing, non-aggressiveness -- because
every act is potentially aggressive. Only when you are in a state of
non-doing are you non-aggressive. You are receptive, and in that
receptivity, the whole existence pours all its treasures into you.</p><p>R.D. Laing's question is perfectly significant. Chidananda, send my
answer to him also. He has been reading my books; he knows me perfectly
well. And he has influenced in the Western psychological field; he is
perhaps the most influential and most original figure today.</p><p>If he makes it a point, he can spread -- rather than
psychological,</p><p>psychoanalytical, and psychiatric ideas -- what the West needs: a
deep understanding of meditation, of non-doing and of allowing existence
to take its own course.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 140</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device 14</p><p>No time left for any device</p><p>19 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE</p><p>WORLD RUNNING FAST TOWARDS A DEAD END, WITHOUT SHOWING ANY</p><p>MORE HOPE THAT THINGS WILL EVER CHANGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, UP TO</p><p>ONE MONTH AGO, YOU TALKED ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PRESENCE OF</p><p>TWO HUNDRED ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE, OR EVEN ONE, COULD SAVE THE</p><p>WORLD. WHY THIS SHIFT OF EMPHASIS? DID YOU GIVE UP ON THE OTHER</p><p>POSSIBILITY? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THAT</p><p>MADE YOUR VISION CHANGE?</p><p>Chidananda, it is true that I have been talking a lot about the world
running fast towards a dead end. The reason is, factually it is running
towards an end. But it was running towards its end before, too. Now I
want it to be absolutely emphasized on your consciousness, so that you
stop postponing your own transformation. Man's mind is so stupid that if
there is a little possibility to postpone, then he will postpone for
tomorrow -- unless he comes to a dead-end street where there is no way
to go forward and he has to take an absolute about- turn.</p><p>But things in the world are not visible to you. You may go on
sleeping and the world may die. It is urgent that you take it seriously
that the world may not be there tomorrow. You don't have time to waste
for anything else other than your own awakening.</p><p>I still know if there are two hundred enlightened people in the
world, the world can be saved; but I have never told you that just one
enlightened man can save the world. It is a heavy load. One single
enlightened man cannot carry it; two hundred is the minimum. But from
where to bring those two hundred people? They have to be born amongst
you -- you have to become those two hundred people. And your growth is
so slow, there is every fear that before you become enlightened the
world will be gone.</p><p>You are not putting your total energy into meditation, into
awareness. It is one of the things that you are doing, amongst many; and
it is not even the first priority of your life. I want it to become your
first priority. The only way is that I should emphasize, deeply into
your consciousness, that the world is going to end soon.</p><p>And if you are not awakened before its end, you will be lost in a
long journey, because evolution will start from the very beginning on
some other planet. On this planet it took four billion years for man to
arrive. His life began in the ocean as a fish. On another planet, if
this planet is destroyed, life will continue, but it will have to begin
from the very beginning -- and after four billion years you may be again
a human being. It is a great risk to take.</p><p>Nothing has changed in the world; everything is going exactly in the
direction of</p><p>death -- a little faster of course -- and the moment of total
annihilation is coming very close. It all Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>141</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>depends on what your priorities are. If being awakened has become
your priority, and you are ready to sacrifice everything for it, then
there is hope.</p><p>I have told you the ancient story in the Old Testament -- but that
will not help today, the situation is so different. In the Old Testament
there is a story about two big cities almost the same size as Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. The names of those two cities were Sodom and Gomorrah. The
people of those two cities had become so perverted, they were doing all
kinds of unnatural, psychopathological actions. Their sexuality had
totally gone astray. Those two places must have been the California of
the Old Testament.</p><p>The story is that God tried hard to change those people. But to
change anyone is a difficult task, even for a god -- because the very
idea that somebody is trying to change you creates a resistance, even if
the change is for your good, even if there is no vested interest for the
person who is trying to change you. But the very idea that somebody is
trying to change you creates an unconscious resistance not to
change.</p><p>Finally, God gave up the idea and decided to destroy those two cities
because their very existence was dangerous. They could spread all their
diseases to the whole of humanity.</p><p>Sodom was so perverted that people were making love to animals; hence
the word sodomy.</p><p>Gomorrah had gone completely homosexual; heterosexuality had
completely stopped.</p><p>According to the Old Testament, God destroyed those two cities
completely; but there is another version from Hassid mystics.</p><p>Judaism has produced one of the most essential lines of mystics, the
Hassids. The orthodox Jews don't accept them -- the orthodox can never
accept the</p><p>religious. But every organized religion has produced, on the margin,
a rebellious group which is not organized, which has different
interpretations and a different style of life. Hassidism is one of the
most beautiful ways to find oneself and to find the reality of
existence.</p><p>The Hassids have a different version because they cannot accept God
destroying two cities; there must be some way to save them. Their story
is that when God became determined to destroy them, one Hassid
approached God and asked him one question: "You are going to destroy
these two great cities, but have you ever wondered that there may be, in
both cities, two hundred good people? They will also be destroyed, and
this will not be a good precedent.</p><p>Just for the sake of those two hundred, you have to change your
decision."</p><p>God thought for a moment and he said, "I never looked at this side.
Certainly there may be good people and they will be destroyed with the
bad. No, if you can prove that there are two hundred good people, I will
not destroy those two cities."</p><p>The Hassid said, "But suppose there are not two hundred, but only
twenty -- ten in each city. Will you destroy those good people? Does
quantity mean so much to you, and not quality? What does it matter
whether there are two hundred good people or twenty good people?"</p><p>God had to concede to the argument of the Hassid. He said, "Of
course. Prove that there are twenty good people."</p><p>The Hassid said, "And if there is only one good man who lives six
months in one city and six months in another city, what is your idea?
Will you destroy those cities? Will it be a godly action? Ninety-nine
percent of the people can be destroyed, if they are evil, for the one
percent of good people; but one percent of good people cannot be
destroyed to save the ninety-nine percent of evil people."</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 142</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>God said, "You are very persuasive. Okay, show me, where is the good
man?"</p><p>The Hassid said, "I am the good man, and I live six months in one
city to help people transform their ways of life, and six months in
another city for the same purpose. What is your decision? Are you going
to destroy me too? Is not one good man more valuable, has he not more
weight than thousands of evil people?" And according to the Hassidic
story, God had to concede not to destroy those two cities. Orthodox Jews
don't believe in the story because it is not written in the Old
Testament. The story may be a fiction, but I say unto you, it is truer
than any truth. It may not be written in the Old Testament, but its
logic is so clear that it cannot be false. It may not be historical, but
it has a spiritual reality.</p><p>In the same way I have been telling you that two hundred enlightened
people can save the world. Existence is very generous; it cannot destroy
two hundred awakened people, who have reached to the highest peak of
consciousness -- which has taken four billion years of evolution. But
you have to become those two hundred people! To wake you up, I have been
insisting that the end is very close. And this time it is not a
parable.</p><p>Jesus used it as a device, that the end of the world is very close
and the last judgment day is very close. His disciples asked him at the
time of his departure -</p><p>- before the enemies got hold of him and when it was certain that he
would be crucified the next day, their last question was, "When will we
be seeing you again?" He said, "In this very life, because the end of
the world is very close -- but do what I have told you."</p><p>And even Christians don't know what he has told them. The last night
before he was caught they were in the mountains and he told his
disciples, "This may be the last night we are together, and I am going
to do my prayer. While I am praying behind the bush you should remain
awake. It is absolutely essential, to support my prayer, that you are
awake. Don't fall asleep."</p><p>In the middle of his prayer he came back -- and almost all were fast
asleep. He woke them up and said, "Have you not heard me? I had told
you, you have to remain awake. Can't you remain awake just one night? --
because I will not be here with you again. Even my death tomorrow cannot
help you to remain awake?" They were very sorry. They said they would
try, and he went again. This went on four, five times -- he would come
back and they would all be fast asleep.</p><p>According to me this was his last teaching: to remain awake. But
Christianity</p><p>has completely forgotten about it. And I have not seen a single
commentary by Christians on the implications of why Jesus was so
insistently saying, "Be awake!" He was trying his hardest because once
he was gone, there was every possibility they would all fall asleep,
just as the whole of humanity is asleep, and they would start doing in
their dreams things that are not to be done. But things that are not to
be done can be prevented only when you are aware, alert.</p><p>His last teaching was awareness, but the disciples failed him -- not
only those twelve intimate disciples failed him, for two thousand years
all his disciples have failed him. The very word "awareness" has
disappeared from the Christian idea of transforming human beings. Jesus
was continually saying, "The end is very close." That was a device --
because if you feel that there is enough time, why not sleep a little
more? What is the hurry? But if there is no time left at all, perhaps
the shock of it may wake you up.</p><p>What was only a device to Jesus, to me is not a device. It is a
reality. The world is going to end.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 143</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>I have been giving you hope, because I have to do two things: on the
one hand I have to make it clear to you that the world is coming to its
final suicide; and on the other hand, I have to give you the hope that
still there is a possibility at least for you to become awakened.</p><p>Your awakening is of tremendous importance; it has never been so
important before --</p><p>neither with Jesus nor with Gautam Buddha -- because there was enough
time. Time has run out. We are at the fag end of time.</p><p>To make you aware of the reality -- so that you can make some effort
to remain awake, to make some effort to be more conscious and not to get
lost in trivia -- is absolutely necessary.</p><p>That's why my insistence will go on growing, because every day the
end is</p><p>approaching closer.</p><p>Man is so asleep he is almost in a coma, and all his actions are
arising out of this state of coma -- otherwise, there is no necessity
for the world to end. But we are carrying nuclear weapons within our
souls. The end is going to come because of our own ignorance, our own
deep sleep.</p><p>I have heard... a Polack is crossing the Sahara desert on a camel.
After two months alone with the camel, and dreaming of beautiful women,
he starts to find the camel attractive and decides to make love to her.
But as soon as he is ready, the camel stands up, walks a few feet away
and stops. The Polack tries again, but again the camel stands up, walks
a few feet away and stops. The Polack tries again and again with no
luck.</p><p>One day he finds the remains of a plane which has crashed in the
desert, and just nearby a young woman, unconscious, but still alive. For
days he takes care of her and she recovers totally. One morning she
comes to him, looking her prettiest, hugs him and tells him how thankful
she is to him for saving her life. "You have been so sweet with me," she
says, "and I like you so much that I'll do anything for you."</p><p>Looking at her beautiful face, the man says, "Would you really?"
"Yes," she says.</p><p>"Oh, I really appreciate that," replies the Polack. "Would you mind
holding that camel for me please?"</p><p>Such is the situation of humanity. At least you have to come out of
it -- and you need a constant hitting on your head to remind you that
the times are no longer ordinary. And there have never been, in the
whole history of man, such dangerous moments as those through which we
are passing. It is no time for quarreling, arguing about theological
matters; it is not intelligent to console yourself that some miracle
will happen and the world war will be postponed. It is not only the
world war -- the attack is multidimensional.</p><p>The ecology of the earth is breaking down.</p><p>There are thousands of submarines moving around the earth in the
ocean -- and each submarine is carrying nuclear weapons so powerful that
even the whole</p><p>energy that was used in the second world war is nothing compared to
the energy of one submarine carrying nuclear missiles. The Soviet Union
has its own submarines; America has its own submarines. Just by accident
two submarines can collide, and the whole life on the planet will
evaporate into smoke. And the politicians of the world are continually
piling up more and more nuclear weapons.</p><p>The population of the world is growing so fast that just the growth
of population will be enough to kill half of humanity out of hunger and
thirst.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 144</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>Sexual perversions have become so rampant that Gomorrah and Sodom
look very outdated.</p><p>Ten million people around the earth already have AIDS -- which has no
cure. And this number of ten million people is not accurate, because
many countries have not yet declared how many people there have AIDS;
they don't have any way to find it out. For example India is not aware
how many people are suffering from AIDS. Mohammedan countries are bound
to have a very large number of people suffering from AIDS, because
homosexuality has been there for thousands of years.</p><p>Even according to very moderate estimates, by the end of this century
there will be one hundred million people suffering from AIDS. And when
one hundred million people suffer from AIDS, that means at least one
billion people must have been involved in homosexuality.</p><p>These are the multi-dimensional ways that death is approaching the
earth.</p><p>Because we have cut so many forests, a thick layer of carbon dioxide
has gathered on top of our atmosphere, miles away from the earth, where
the air ends. The layer is so thick that it has already increased the
temperature more than it has ever been on the earth; and that rise of
temperature is melting the ice of the north and south poles. If that ice
goes on melting -- and there is no way to prevent it -- all the oceans
of the world will rise four feet higher. And all your</p><p>big cities are ports; they will be flooded with water, will become
unlivable.</p><p>If this carbon dioxide becomes a little thicker, then the Himalayas
and the Alps, which have eternal snow which has never melted, will start
melting. The Himalayas alone have so much ice that if it melts
completely, it will raise all the oceans of the world forty feet
higher.</p><p>All your cities will be drowned, and this is not a flood that is
going to recede.</p><p>One of the most dangerous things happening is that carbon dioxide is
going to accumulate more and more. The trees go on inhaling carbon
dioxide. If you cut the trees you are cutting two things: the supply of
oxygen for your life, and the place for carbon dioxide to be absorbed.
It is a double-edged sword -- and absolutely unnecessary.</p><p>Man has been trying to reach to the moon and to Mars, and before
that, we were never aware that where the air ends, miles above earth...
all around the earth there is a thick layer of a certain gas, ozone, O3,
which is a very protective layer. Because of that ozone, life has been
possible on earth. That ozone has only one function: it does not allow
any sunrays which are destructive to life; it returns them. It allows
only those rays which are life-giving.</p><p>Because of our rockets moving towards the moon and towards Mars, we
have made holes, for the first time, in the layer of ozone. Now those
holes are allowing in all the rays of the sun towards the earth -- and
death-rays are also included.</p><p>So when I say the end is not very far away, it is not like when Jesus
says it -- just a device.</p><p>By the end of this century, you will see all these dimensions
bringing death to you. It has to be emphasized: unless you become
absolutely clear about death, you are not going to concentrate your
whole energy on transforming your being.</p><p>People change with difficulty; they find it easier to remain as they
are -- just like stones, like rocks. Change means a determined effort, a
commitment to transform your energies, to take your being in an
absolutely serious manner -- it has not to be wasted in stupid
things.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>145</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>A famous playboy dies, and his best friends decide to celebrate with
a mourning party.</p><p>Late in the night someone suggests calling Hell in order to find out
where he is. "But how can you call Hell?" someone asks.</p><p>"Well," the man answers, "I guess it is just a long distance
call."</p><p>So they check the telephone book and find out all about outer space
calls and then dial Hell. A few seconds later a very hoarse voice
answers, "This is Hell. What do you want?"</p><p>Terrified by the devilish voice, they say, "We are looking for a
friend." "What is his name?"</p><p>"Peter Thompson."</p><p>"He is not here." And the devil hangs up.</p><p>Totally amazed and having dropped all reference to logic, they decide
to call Purgatory.</p><p>They dial Purgatory, and to their relief, the voice on the phone does
not sound so terrible --</p><p>more businesslike. They explain that they are looking for a dead
friend who is not in Hell and who just died.</p><p>"Well," the voice answers, "he is not here, either. Try Heaven." "But
he was a playboy!" his friends reply.</p><p>"He has to be somewhere. Try Heaven."</p><p>So they dial Heaven, and a heavenly voice answers very softly and
slowly, "Hello. This is Heaven. This is Virgin Mary. Can I help
you?"</p><p>Very shy, they explain the whole story.</p><p>"No," says the beautiful voice, full of echo: "He is not here. Thank
you for calling. Call again."</p><p>So every day they call Heaven, and every day they get the same
answer. So they call again and again; and one week later, on Sunday
morning, a very sexy, foxy, quick voice answers,</p><p>"Hey, this is Mary. What do you want, guys...?"</p><p>Looking at each other and laughing, the friends agree: "He has
arrived!"</p><p>Change is very difficult. A playboy will be a playboy, whether he is
in hell or in heaven; he will go on doing his repetitive style of
life.</p><p>Being alert means you have to stop being robots. Change your
routines, move more consciously; let every act become an object of
awareness. Then even these few years that are left are enough -- more
than enough. If you put your total energy into transformation, the
destruction of the earth will not be your destruction. If you can die
consciously, you have found the key to a higher life, to an eternal
life, to a divine life.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS THIS UNDERCURRENT OF GIGGLING IN MY HEART EVERY TIME I FEEL
THAT YOU ARE USING THE WHOLE WORLD AS A DEVICE FOR OUR</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 146</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>GROWTH, AND THAT YOU ARE USING US AS A DEVICE FOR THE WHOLE</p><p>WORLD? WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>Sarjano, you will have to stop your giggling in the heart. This is
not a device. There is no time left for any device at all. Your giggling
is simply a rationalization: you don't want to believe that the world is
going to end because you don't want to change. You want me to say to you
that this is only a device, so that you can relax -- relax in your fixed
pattern of life. But I cannot lie to you.</p><p>When I use something as a device, I tell you it is a device. But this
is not a device, either to transform the world through you or to change
you through the world. I am simply stating a very sad fact. Your
giggling is nothing but an effort to erase the impact which I am trying
to create.</p><p>Giggle about everything else, but not about your transformation. That
giggling is your unconscious trying to deceive you, telling you
something or other will happen, so you need not worry.</p><p>The unconscious does not want to disappear. Your unconscious is nine
times more than your conscious; it is nine times more powerful too. And
you have to be very alert not to be caught in the powerful unconscious;
otherwise, it will close all the doors, all the possibilities, all the
potentialities of transformation.</p><p>I am in absolute support of your giggling about everything in the
world except the transformation that is needed within you. And the
problem is that you are very serious about everything in the world, and
only nonserious about your own interiority.</p><p>During his world tour, the Polack pope arrives in America. When he
comes out of the plane, there is a big crowd standing on the runway
waving flags, shouting, "Elvis, Elvis!"</p><p>The pope looks at them, full of holiness, kisses the ground and says
mildly, "My children, look: I am not Elvis, I am the pope."</p><p>He enters the airport hall and notices a mass of people standing
there, dancing, waving flags and shouting at him: "Elvis, Elvis!"</p><p>A little bit indignant, he blesses the people, and very softly he
says, "Oh no, my dear sheep, I am not Elvis, I am the pope."</p><p>Later on, when he finally reaches his hotel, he can't believe his
eyes: in the lobby, hundreds of people are crowded, waving flags,
yelling, "Elvis, Elvis!"</p><p>A little bit puzzled now, he puts his hands together, makes a cross,
smiles as divinely as possible and announces, "No, my beloved little
lambs. No, I am not Elvis, I am the pope."</p><p>Centered again, he goes upstairs to his suite, opens the door and
suddenly sees two beautiful naked women are lying in his bed, waving
little flags, shouting ecstatically at him,</p><p>"Elvis, Elvis!"</p><p>Immediately, jumping out of his clothes, he starts singing, "You
ain't nothing but a hound-dog..."</p><p>Your unconscious is always there, so powerful that if it gets any
chance -- pope or no pope</p><p>-- the unconscious will be the winner. You have to make your
consciousness so strong that the unconscious slowly, slowly becomes
weaker and finally dies. That's the meaning of the Osho - The Hidden
Splendor</p><p>147</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>enlightened man: one whose unconsciousness has disappeared, whose
whole being is full of consciousness.</p><p>Whatever I am saying, it is my absolutely clear vision that the world
is very close to its end. Don't giggle it away. Don't find
rationalizations; they won't help.</p><p>There is no time to waste in any unconscious consolations. An
immediate transformation is absolutely needed; it is an urgency which
man has never faced before. In a way, you are unfortunate that soon
there will be no future. In another way, you are very fortunate because
this crisis is so big -- perhaps it may help you to wake up.</p><p>Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>OFTEN, WHEN I COME TO SEE YOU I WANT SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION: A SIGN
THAT YOU SEE ME, THAT YOU KNOW I EXIST</p><p>-- A LOOK, A HAND</p><p>GESTURE, PERHAPS TO ANSWER A QUESTION. YOU NEVER RESPOND TO THIS.</p><p>FEELING THE TENSION AND PAIN THIS LONGING CAUSES IN ME, I CRY AND</p><p>THEN RELAX. AN OPENING IS THERE AND YOU LOOK MY WAY. OSHO, MUST I
ALWAYS GO THROUGH THIS WAY OF PAIN AND TEARS TO REACH MY INNER</p><p>BEING? I AM JEWISH BY CONDITIONING -- COULD THAT BE PART OF IT?</p><p>Prem Indivar, that explains everything -- that you are Jewish by
conditioning. But your question may be the question of many others.</p><p>You say, "Often when I come to see You I want some kind of
recognition." This is one of the sicknesses of our souls. The whole
existence recognizes you -- the birds by their songs, the trees by their
flowers, the sun by its rays, the moon by its beauty -- they are all
recognizing you. Just you have forgotten. You want recognition in a
human way; perhaps in language.</p><p>Existence is silent, its recognition is silent.</p><p>All that you have to know is to be silent to understand the
recognition.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, I have given you recognition just by
initiating you on the path of mysticism. I have not asked whether you
are worthy or not, whether you deserve or not. I have recognized your
potential spirituality without any examination, without any test.</p><p>You say "... a sign that you see me, that you know I exist -- a look,
a hand gesture, perhaps to answer a question." I know that you exist --
and my whole effort is that you should not exist; that's why I go on
avoiding seeing you!</p><p>Because seeing you may give you energy and nourishment to exist, and
that is not your true existence; that is your ego, you are suffering
from an inferiority complex. I want you to drop this ego which is hungry
for recognition. And the moment you drop it, immediately you will find
there is recognition.</p><p>You say, "You never respond to this. Feeling the tension and pain
this longing causes in me, I cry and then relax." If you have carefully
understood your own question, it has the answer: You cry and then relax.
"An opening is there and you look my way."</p><p>If you are relaxed the whole existence is tremendously happy. Not
only am I looking at you, everything is looking at you. But the reason
is your relaxation, the reason is your crying; Osho - The Hidden
Splendor</p><p>148</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>your tears cleanse you, your relaxation does not allow the ego to
form. And you have come to know the secret -- that I look your
way...</p><p>"Osho, must I always go through this way of pain and tears to reach
my inner being?" It all depends on you. If you love it, if you want it
this way -- only then do you have to go through pain and tears.
Otherwise you can go through laughter and singing and dancing. The whole
question is that in pain and tears, or in singing and dancing, the ego
disappears -- it is your choice.</p><p>I have heard, a man noticed a signboard on a restaurant saying, "You
are welcome here, and you will feel absolutely at home. Come in; at
least just give us one chance to serve you."</p><p>The man entered. The waitress came and he ordered four burnt
chapatis. The waitress could not believe what he was saying --
"Vegetable without any salt," and things like that. She said, "Are you
joking?"</p><p>He said, "No." So she went, burned the chapatis, and brought the
plates, feeling very weird about the whole thing -- what kind of man is
he? And then she asked, "Anything more?"</p><p>He said, "Yes, sit across from me and nag."</p><p>She said, "You seem to be a very strange fellow." He said, "I am not
a strange fellow --</p><p>just in front of your door, you say 'You will feel at home,' and I
want to feel at home. That's what happens in my home: burnt chapatis,
vegetables without salt, everything wrong -- and finally my wife sitting
across from me, nagging me. Because of her nagging, I cannot even say
that the chapatis are burned, that there is no salt..."</p><p>It is up to you: both are possibilities. You can relax through pain
and tears... but that is not a good choice. You can relax through
singing, dancing, rejoicing -- and relaxation will come.</p><p>Try the other way.</p><p>You say, "I am Jewish by conditioning. Could that be part of it?" It
certainly is. But once you have become a sannyasin, you are no longer
Jewish. A sannyasin is simply a human being. Your conditioning is there,
but rather than continuing the tears and pain, start singing and
dancing. Even if it feels a little difficult in the beginning, the
conditioning can be changed; you can be unconditioned.</p><p>At the conclusion of the physical exam, the doctor summoned his
patient into his office with a very grave look on his face. "I hate to
be the one to break it to you, Fred," he said, "but I'm afraid you have
only got six months to live."</p><p>"Oh my god!" gasped Fred, turning white. When the news had sunk in
his heart he said,</p><p>"Listen, Doc, you have known me a long time. Do you have any
suggestions as to how I could make the most of my remaining months?"</p><p>"Have you ever been married?" asked the doctor.</p><p>Fred explained that he had been a bachelor all his life. "You might
think about taking a wife," the doctor proposed. "After all, you will
need someone to look after you in the final illness."</p><p>"That's a good point, Doc," said Fred. "And with only six months to
live, I'd better make the most of my time."</p><p>"May I make one more suggestion?" asked the doctor. When Fred nodded,
he said, "Marry a Jewish girl." Osho - The Hidden Splendor</p><p>149</p><p>Chapter 14 - No time left for any device</p><p>"A Jewish girl -- how come?" wondered Fred.</p><p>The doctor replied, "Then six months will seem like six lives."</p><p>It is your choice, but my suggestion is: you have been married to
Jewish conditioning; now get divorced. Just be a human being, rejoicing,
dancing, singing. And if tears come they have to be of joy, of
blissfulness, of peace, of silence. And the moment you feel relaxed,
ecstasy will enter within your being from all sides. The whole existence
will recognize you, not only me.</p><p>Ecstasy can be explained in other words:</p><p>A recognition by the whole existence that you are needed, that you
are beautiful, that without you existence will be poorer.</p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p>Osho - The Hidden Splendor 150</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part50>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

DIE, OH YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING.\nDIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.\nMan lives in ego. Ego is only a mask, not your being. Ego is not your reality, it is your acting. Ego is not your truth it is your belief. In a drama, when someone is cast as Rama he doesn’t become Rama, in the same way you are cast here as something which you are not. A vast drama goes on. When you were born you didn’t come with a name. A name was given to you and you became that name. You didn’t come with any knowledge when you were born. You were taught and made to study, you went to school, to college. Many thoughts were poured into your brain. You were thrown into knowledge. Then you began to think it is your knowledge. Nothing in all this is yours. Everything is borrowed, everything is stale leftovers. Your name is not yours, your knowledge is not yours. The intelligence that you think is yours is not yours – it too has been constructed from others. If someone says you are very beautiful you fall for it. And if someone says you are simply incomparable you fall for that. If anyone praises you, you wrap it up to keep it. If anyone insults you you’re hurt.\nYour personality is constructed from others opinions. It is the creation of other hands. Others have brought their brushes and painted you. And if you accept this as your being you will never be able to know yourself.\nGorakh says, DIE, OH YOGI, DIE! Let this false form die, so you can experience your real form. Let your mask fall away. It is good if this clothing burns to ash, so your truth, naked, can manifest in\nits naturalness. Until the ego is gone there will be no experience of being. And one who does not experience his own being, his soul, how will he become conscious of the soul of existence?\nSoul is a drop, existence is the ocean. If you experience the drop you begin to experience the ocean too, because the ocean is hidden in the drop. And what else is the ocean than combined drops?\nYou are a ray, god is the sun. And the sun is nothing but the combining of rays. God is the combination of all of us. God is the totality of all of us. You go out searching for god but you don’t destroy the ego. You have not yet recognized even this one ray but you go in search of the sun? You will wander much... Right now you are false, whatever you find will also be false. The false cannot reach the truth, the false will reach only greater falsities.\nThe ego is false, a drama. Whatever you do while this drama is running will be illusory. Make vows, do ascetic practices, control, fast; abandon your home and go to the jungle. Nothing will come of it. Your ego will receive new ornaments from all of these. It will become more beautified, better arranged. Your ego will not die, it will get more life, become more nourished. And until the ego dies, there is no experience of being. To experience being the ego must be lost.\nDIE, OH YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING.\nGorakh says, the death I am telling you about is very sweet. If one dies this death, life is nothing but sweetness. Truth is very sweet when you experience it. It is the taste of nectar. It spreads in the body and heart, you are filled with it. It begins overflowing. Certainly one who has received the truth is himself fulfilled. But droplets of fulfillment also start falling on those who are near him, lightly showering on those who sit in his shelter. But one must die – this is the condition.\nIf the false dies, the truth is born. Truth is present within, but imprisoned in a wall of lies. Clouds of lies have hidden the sun of truth. It has not been destroyed. What lie can destroy the truth? It is not lost either, it has been forgotten. It is like a veil over someone’s face, the face is not destroyed, it is veiled, it is simply not visible.\nWe have hidden our being behind the veil of ego. People think there is a veil covering the mystery of existence. They are wrong. The veil is on your eyes. The veil is covering you, existence is completely unveiled. Existence is naked all around you but you need eyes to see it.\nToday’s sutra is about how this sweet death happens. What is the process? What is its essential discipline? ... sutras about this. How can we die? What is Gorakh’s death like? DIE THAT DEATH...\nEveryone dies. But there are differences in dying. You will die, Buddha also dies, but there is a difference between your dying and Buddha’s. You will die only from the body and save your ego, your lie, taking it with you – it will adorn your mind like a treasure. Your ego will enter a new womb. You will die, your mind will not die. And nothing changes until the mind dies. Masks change, houses change but the journey is the same, just going round and round like an old ox in a grist mill. You have died many times, and you have been born again many times. Hardly have you died when you start being born again.\nThe ego hides all your diseases inside itself, enters a new womb, and starts taking a new body. But the desires are old, the diseases are old, the miseries are old, the ruts are old. You move ahead,\nget tired again, fall again, die again, this has happened many times. Buddha also dies, but there is a difference between his dying and your dying. Your ego does not die, it only abandons the body. He dissolves his ego, burns up his ego. Before the body is abandoned he abandons his ego. One who dies before dying, experiences the ultimate life. Then he has no need to come back again, because the very thread that used to pull him back has died.\nBeing has no birth, no death. The ego is born, only the ego dies. And one who is released from ego is eternal. Then he doesn’t die, he isn’t born. One living, changeless, beyond time. Then you are as big as the sky. This is your nature.\nDIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.\nThis is why he says, don’t think that I am talking about ordinary dying. Everyone dies ordinary deaths: birds and animals die, plants die, mountains die. Gorakh is not talking about this death, he is talking about a special death – die in samadhi, die in meditation. Let the ego go and dissolve into meditation. As long as the ego exists one cannot dissolve in meditation.\nWhat is the secret of the ego’s living? If this is understood, then the art of its dying will also be understood. The ego lives in extremes. Extremes are the life force of the ego. Perhaps you have never considered it, thought it over, looked at it with awareness that the abode of the ego is in extremes. More, more, more... this is the ego’s way of life. Ten thousand rupees should become one hundred thousand, one hundred thousand should become one million. More, more, more... ego lives in this insanity. The ego lives in extremes. And the extreme can be of anything, whether it’s money or knowledge, power or renunciation – but more.\nOne who has done a thirty day fast thinks next time he will do a forty day fast. One who has fasted forty days thinks next time he will fast fifty days. What is the difference? One who has forty million rupees thinks it should become fifty million. What is the difference? One who has started eating only twice a day instead of three times, thinks when should I begin eating only once? One who eats only once thinks, how can I be finished with eating even once?\nA youth was brought to me. He wanted to know how he could live only on water. He didn’t want to take anything else, because anything else is indulgence. How to live only on water? He had withered. He had come to India from America in search of someone to tell him the secret of living on water. I said, “If I tell you the secret how to live on water will you be satisfied?”\nHe closed his eyes and thought. He was a thoughtful youth. He kept on sitting for about half an hour. Then he said, “No, then I would ask how can one live on air.” Only on air, why even this nuisance of water?\nSuch is the desire of the mind, the running of the ego – for more. What direction you run makes no difference. The ego lives in extremes, whether it is the extreme of money or renunciation, the extreme of indulgence or yoga. Stop in the middle and the ego will die. This is why Buddha calls his path majjhim nikaya, the middle path, exactly in the center.\nA youth, Prince Shrona, was initiated by Buddha. The people in the capital could not believe it. No one had ever imagined that Shrona would become a bhikkhu, a monk. Buddha’s monks could not\nbelieve it either, their eyes were popping out when Shrona came and fell at Buddha’s feet and said, “Initiate me, make me a bhikkhu.”\nShrona was an emperor, and a famous emperor. He was famous for indulgence. His royal palace had the most beautiful women of that era. His palace had the finest wines, gathered from every corner of the world. Celebration went on all night long, he slept all day. He was so drowned in indulgence that no one had ever thought he could imagine becoming a sannyasin. When he climbed the steps he didn’t have railings put up, but had naked women stand there. He would climb the stairs putting his hand on their shoulders. He made his house into a heaven. His palace was such that gods in heaven would be jealous.\nThe bhikkhus asked Buddha, “We can’t believe it, Shrona being initiated!”\nBuddha said, “Whether you believe it or not, I knew he was going to take sannyas. To tell you the truth it is for him that I came to the capital today. What goes to one extreme will go to the other extreme too. Indulgence is one extreme, he did that completely. Now there is no way to move further there, no way to satisfy the ego. He has whatever is possible in that world. Now a wall has come in front of the ego, where can the ego go now? The ego demands more. Now there isn’t any more, so the ego must return, must go back in the opposite direction. When the pendulum of a clock goes all the way to the right, it must return towards the left. Then it goes all the way to the left and has to return again to the right. When the pendulum of a clock is going to the left, remember that it is gathering momentum to go to the right. And when it is going to the right it is gathering momentum to go to the left. One who has a subtle vision will be able to see this. One who goes into extreme indulgence will one day go into extreme yoga.\nBuddha said, “Wait a few days, you will see the truth of what I am saying.”\nAnd people saw. The other bhikkhus walked on a well paved road, but Shrona walked through thorns and brush, his feet became drenched in blood. When the sun was hot the other bhikkhus sat in the shade of the trees. Shrona would stand in the sun. The other bhikkhus wore clothes, he used only a loin cloth. And it seemed as if he was eager to drop the loin cloth too. Then one day he did drop it. The other bhikkhus ate once a day, Shrona ate only once in two days. The other bhikkhus ate sitting down. Shrona ate standing up. The other bhikkhus kept a bowl, Shrona didn’t keep even a bowl, only his hand... he ate only the food that fit in his hand. His beautiful body shrivelled. Previously people used to come from miles around to see his body. His face had been very charming, immensely beautiful. After he had been a bhikkhu for three months anyone who saw him would not recall that this was Emperor Shrona. His feet became blistered, his body became black, he shrivelled and became just bones. And he went on disciplining himself.\nBuddha said, “Do you see bhikkhus, I had told you that what goes to one extreme, will go to the other extreme! It is difficult to stop in the middle, because the middle is the death of the ego.”\nThen Shrona stopped eating. Then he stopped taking water. He continued from one extreme to another. It seemed he would be a guest on this earth only two or three more days, then die. This is when Buddha went to his door, to the tree under which he had built a hut to rest in. He was lying down. Buddha said to him, “Shrona, I have come to ask you something. I have heard that when you were an emperor you had a passion for playing the veena, and that you were very skilled at playing\nit, that you took great interest in the veena. I have come to ask you a question: when the strings of the veena are very loose, will music arise or not?”\nShrona said, “What are you talking about? You know it well, if the strings are very loose music cannot arise, they cannot even sound a twang.”\nBuddha said, “Then I ask you this: if the strings are tightened too much will music arise or not?”\nShrona said, “If they are tightened too much the strings will snap, music will not arise, only the sound of snapping strings will arise. How can music arise from the sound of an instrument breaking?”\nThen Buddha said, “I have come to remind you. Just as you have experienced the veena, I experience the veena of life. I say unto you, if the strings of life are very tight music does not arise, and if the strings of life are very loose, again music does not arise. The strings need to be in the middle Shrona, neither too tight nor too loose. The greatest skill of a musician is in bringing the strings exactly to the middle, this is what is meant by tuning an instrument.”\nThis is why when you see Indian classical music, it takes half an hour or an hour to tune the instruments. Tuning instruments is a great art. To bring the strings to that middle point where it cannot be said that they are too loose or too tight, one needs great skill, a very sensitive ear. Only a connoisseur of music is able to tune.\n“The veena of life is exactly the same,” Buddha said, “It is enough Shrona, wake up now. I was waiting to let you come to the extreme. At first your strings were very loose, now you have tightened them too much. Music didn’t happen then, nor does it happen now: are you experiencing samadhi? What is all this that you are doing? Previously you stuffed yourself, now you are fasting to death. Previously you never went barefoot, if you went anywhere the road was covered with velvet. And now if the path is good you will not move on it. You move in the brush, in the thorns, on rough, rugged paths. Perhaps previously you had never drunk water but only wine. Now you are afraid to drink even water! Now you want to avoid water too. Previously at your house incomparable meat dishes were prepared, now you are not ready even to eat dry bread. See how you have moved from one extreme to the other? That extreme was unmusical, this too is unmusical. I call out to you: Now is the time, come to the middle.”\nTears began to flow from Shrona’s eyes. He became alert. He saw his situation.\nToday’s sutras are sutras for bringing the strings of the veena to the middle. And as soon as someone comes to the middle, the ego dies – it cannot live. The ego is a disease, the ego can exist only if your mind is sick. The life of the ego comes out of your being sick, and extremes are the secret of your being sick.\nI am also saying to my sannyasins, I give you the lesson of the veena strings of life – the middle. Be in the world as if you are not in the world. The world will not control you, nor is there any need to renounce it and escape. Neither become indulgent nor a yogi, stay in the middle. Don’t run after money, nor renounce money and run away, stop in the middle, exactly in the middle, where there are no extremes. There you will find music resounding! The veena comes to life. The unstruck sound starts echoing.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE. DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...\nAll those who have written commentaries and annotations for this sutra give it the meaning: don’t speak without thinking. That meaning does not seem right to me. Linguistically it is correct: you should not immediately speak, when someone says something you shouldn’t answer abruptly, you should think it over then answer. Linguistically the meaning is right, but existentially the meaning is not right. Replying after thinking about it means that the answer will not be spontaneous, it will be thought out – in the next line Gorakh says:\nGORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nTheir interpretation does not fit with living spontaneously. Living would become very unspontaneous. Then the answer you give would be thought out and arranged, not spontaneous.\nA spontaneous reply, spontaneous speech is something entirely different. It is not related to thinking. Whenever you think it over your answer becomes unspontaneous. Someone asks something, before answering you examine everything: what you should say, what you shouldn’t say; what will make a good impression, what will make a bad impression; who will gain from it, who will be harmed by it. If you speak after thinking over and calculating all this your expression will no longer have spontaneity. Your expression will become false. Spontaneous expression comes from no-thought.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...\nOthers say this means to speak thoughtfully. And I say it means speak from no-thought, speak wakefully. To speak abruptly indicates unconsciousness. Stay aware inside, let the lamp of awareness keep burning, let your attention be alert. Don’t speak thoughtfully, speak from no-thought.\nNote these two expressions – speak ‘thoughtlessly’ and speak from ‘no-thought.’ Thoughtlessly speaking means saying whatever comes into your mouth and repenting afterwards.\nI was a guest one night at a friend’s house. Anand Swami an old disciple of Mahatma Gandhi was also a guest at the house. We were in the same room in the evening. Everyone in the house gathered. A conversation started. I asked Anand Swami what had impressed him about Mahatma Gandhi, because he had dedicated his whole life to Gandhi. He said, “The first impression Gandhi made on me was when Gandhi came to India from Africa. He gave a statement to the press in Ahmedabad. I was working as a newspaper reporter, a journalist. In his statement he said some vulgar words against the English. I took the vulgar words out of his statement and the report that was given in the newspapers contained no swear words at all. The next day Gandhi called for me, slapped me on the back and said, ‘Well done. This is how reporting should be. You did well to remove the vulgar words.’\n“By slapping me on the back this way,” Anand Swami told me, “Gandhi won me over.”\nI told him, “This is all backwards. Did you try another experiment to see if Gandhi didn’t use vulgar words and you added them to his statement, whether or not he would slap your back even then? That would be something!\n“It means that Gandhi spoke too eagerly. DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY... It was spoken in eagerness, in excitement, with zeal. It was spoken in the flow of his speech. Then afterwards he must have regretted it. He must have thought retrospectively that the vulgar words I spoke, the swearing I used, should not have happened. They are not appropriate for a Mahatma. He must have regretted. Then you took out the vulgar words. You protected Gandhi’s ego, so he slapped your back. In this way your ego was fed: ‘He slapped my back. I am quite some journalist, a great journalist.’ Still the statement that was published was false. And if Gandhi were a lover of truth, he should have said to you to publish the statement exactly as he had said it. When I have said it why make changes before publishing? Gandhi was not interested in truth. Gandhi’s talk about truth has become worthless. He patronized a lie. What was not said was published, what was said was not published. This is giving protection to a lie. You protected his ego; he seduced your ego. This is how you supported each other.”\nI told Anand Swami, “If there are swear words in my statements they should be published, because when I have said it, I have said it. And if later I find out that I didn’t want to say it, then it means that at the time of speaking I was was not in my senses, I was unconscious.”\nSpeaking has its own intoxication. Many times you will say something that you didn’t want to say. But it is not a question of whether you wanted to or not. You said it. It was lying there somewhere in your unconscious.\n“The statement that you published, Anand Swami,” I said to him, “gave shelter to a lie. Now for centuries it will be said that Gandhi never swore. You will be responsible for it. You were to publish just what you had written down, just what was said – just like it was. If you are to help Gandhi change then going back and correcting will not be needed. He should speak with discrimination. He should speak with awareness. Gandhi spoke thoughtlessly, understanding came only later. He must have thought, ‘What have I said?’ He must have looked back, he must have felt the consequences could be bad. It would be good if somehow these words could be taken back.”\nIt happens every day. One day a political leader says something and the next day he refutes it – “No, that’s not what I said, or that’s not what I meant, or the meaning has been distorted, or it was just an off the cuff remarks and he back’s out.\nIt happens every day, you see it daily in the papers. It is a surprising thing. He remembers afterwards because when he is considering, measuring its effect he finds that it would have been better if it were never said, saying it can have such and such a result. He was speaking in such a hurry that there was no chance to weigh what the consequences might be. It was said hastily in his speech. Later sitting quietly, he considered and figured out the consequences. What meanings could be stretched, how many opinions would be influenced to agree, how many will be influenced against, what will be the consequence in the political race. The move has been made, what will it mean finally in the whole game of chess? When he stops and thinks all this the idea of changing it arises, so he changes it. But this change indicates only one thing – he spoke thoughtlessly.\nI have heard, in England a student was taking an oral examination in a medical college. He had passed all the other subjects, the oral exam was the last. If he passes this he will receive England’s highest degree in medicine. Three doctors were examining him. They asked him, “If you have such and such a patient with such and such a disease and you are to give these medicines, what amount\nwill you give?” He quickly said the amount. All three doctors laughed. They said, “Okay, you can go. The exam is over.”\nHe was just going out the door when it came to him, “That amount would take his life, it is poison.” He returned and said, “Pardon me, I would give him half of what I had said.”\nBut the doctors said, “The patient has died, who are you coming back to tell? What’s said is said. This is not merely an exam. If there were a patient and you gave him this dosage the patient would have died, who’s pardon are you asking? Come next year, prepare yourself better. You cannot just come back and correct your statement like this. If we change it, it would be false, the patient has already died.”\nDon’t speak thoughtlessly – giving it this meaning does not mean to speak thoughtfully. In my vision its meaning is no-thought. Where there is thought there will be error. Where there is no thought, the mind is completely quiet, like a mirror, silent, empty, where meditation has awakened – there is never any mistake. There is no need to turn and look back. There is never any repentance.\nThis is why I give it the meaning: speaking attentively, what Buddha called right remembering. Speaking wakefully. Speaking alertly. Not after thinking: is there an opportunity for thinking, is there time or not? Where is there time in life? Many times you want to say good things but can’t say them, later you remember.\nThe great Western thinker Victor Hugo was coming out of a sitting room. Three or four other writers were coming with him, conversing. One writer expressed something. It was such a lovely statement that from Victor Hugo’s mouth came out, “If only I had said that!”\nA third writer said, “Hugo, don’t worry. You will say it. Some day or other you will say it. If not today you’ll say it tomorrow. It will come out of your mouth, don’t worry. You will say it in other circumstances, but you will certainly say it. You cannot leave it alone.”\nBut what is said is said. You may also have felt many times that you could have said that. It is as if someone has stolen the words which you were about to say, stolen the words that had come to your lips. And sometimes you feel that if only you had held back just one word, how much trouble you would have avoided. Because sometimes a small word can change a whole life. A small curse you have given may change your whole life, and a sweet statement falling from your lips may make your whole life new, nothing can be said about it... just a small statement.\nThe famous American actress Greta Garbo was very poor in her childhood. And she used to work in a barber shop lathering soap on people’s beards. She had never thought she would become such a great actress, a world famous actress. One day a movie director came to the barber shop to get a haircut and she lathered soap on his face. While she was lathering – he was a movie director – looking at her face in the mirror, just one word slipped out of his mouth, “Beautiful... what a beautiful face.”\nAnd this small statement became a revolution in Greta Garbo’s life. A girl getting two cents for lathering beards died the owner of millions of dollars – just this small statement. It was not said after thinking it over, it came out spontaneously. But Greta Garbo was reminded of her beauty. For the\nfirst time she looked at herself in the mirror with great deliberation. Daily she had stood in front of the mirror, but she just went on lathering people’s beards. She had never noticed. She had never thought that she was beautiful, or that she could be beautiful. The poor girl didn’t have the capacity even to think of it.\nGreta Garbo asked, “Really, you think I am beautiful?”\nThe movie director said, “Not just beautiful, but one of the most beautiful women. And if you want I will prove it, because I am a movie director. I am making a movie. I can put you in it. You have a photogenic face, that will look so beautiful in the picture. I have been working with pictures my whole life.”\nThis is why it often happens that some person, film actor or actress when you meet them directly doesn’t seem so beautiful: he has a photogenic face. In a photograph they appear beautiful whether face to face they look beautiful or not. These are two different things. Many times people are very beautiful when you meet them face to face, but don’t look so beautiful in a picture.\nGreta Garbo ascended the skies. A small incident, an accidental word changed her whole life. Otherwise perhaps she would have died still lathering soap on people’s beards. A small word can give rise to such ripples: can make a friend, can make an enemy; can give life beauty, can make it ugly.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...\nBut the meaning I give it is not speak thoughtfully: in thought is calculating, cunning, cleverness, politics. I say, speak from no-thought, from a feeling of peace and silence. Let it arise in silence from deep within. And then what you say will be integral, because it arises out of peace. Right speech and you will settle down. Otherwise the ego takes you from one extreme to the next.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...\nDon’t walk stamping your feet. Don’t make noise in your life. Pass by so that no one knows. Remain absent. This is god’s way of being. God is present everywhere, but he is unknown. What is his art? DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT... Don’t stamp your feet. Don’t go on pointing your finger at yourself saying look at me.\nGod is present as an absence. He is present. He is visible to those who also become absent, who themselves become completely silent. Only in their eyes is his face reflected.\nDON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...\nPeople move with such pride. They walk arrogantly, uselessly arrogant.\nHave you noticed? When you are alone on the street you walk in one way. If the path is deserted, no one in sight, you’re out for a morning walk, you move in a certain way. You won’t strut. But then suddenly two people come on the road, and your step changes. You watch tomorrow, your step will change. When two people enter the road, your step will change. Now you move in a different\nway. And if two beautiful women step onto the road then your stride will change even more. You will quickly dust yourself off and start proudly twisting your mustache, straighten up your tie, put your hat at a slant. You will immediately start strutting along. Even without mustache people proudly twist. It is not necessary to have a mustache to stand proud. Pride is a separate matter. It can be shown in any manner, some with a mustache, some with a tie, but show pride.\nPeople walk as if the whole world is watching them, as if everyone’s eyes are on them.\nStrutting means, everyone’s eyes should be on me. Why? Because the ego demands attention from people. And the more attention ego gets from others the more it is nourished. The more people greet you on the street, the more people agree that yes, you are something, the more your ego is strengthened. Go out on the street one day, if no one even looks, no one even says hello, if the whole village has decided to treat you this way, to pretend you don’t even exist – you will be very unhappy. You will come back tired and defeated. You will say, what happened? Your strutting has had no effect.\nYou watch small children, they play this game every day. There is no great difference in grown ups. From the youngest to the oldest there are nothing but children. If you want to watch grown up children, go to Delhi sometime – children of sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five, eighty, eighty-three. Someone is prime minister [83 year old Morarji Desai]. Someone is home minister, someone is defense minister, and they go on chasing after each other, like small children. Like children fighting on a garbage heap playing king of the mountain. And if one stands on top then the others go on shoving and a great match of pushing and shoving ensues. Each one twists his mustache in pride. And each one says to himself, “I will overpower each and every one of them and stay up. Look how I threw this one down, or look how I put that one flat on his back.”\nFrom young age to old, people remain children. As long as you attract attention, as long as you say look at me, you are a child, you are childish.\nYou experience it in children every day. If there are children at your house, when a guest comes you tell the children a guest is coming, just be quiet. Then the children cannot remain silent. They would otherwise be sitting quietly in the corner playing with their dolls, but as soon as guests come the children come and get in the way. They start asking irrelevant questions... I want ice cream, I am hungry. You are surprised, until now the child was sitting silently, what has happened to him? The child has become a politician. He is saying. “Will these guests go without looking at me? I will show them, I will tell them that I too am someone. This house runs according to me, I will demonstrate it.”\nIf you tell a child something when you are alone with him he will accept it. If you say it in front of four people he is not willing to accept it, he stubbornly refuses. This is why if you take a child who is well behaved at home to the market he will cause an embarrassment right in the middle – I want to buy this, I want to buy that. And what is your embarrassment? The embarrassment is that in front of four persons you cannot say that I cannot buy it, I don’t have the money, my pocket is empty, don’t torture me. He is waiting for this opportunity to show you...\nSmall children can easily push your buttons. Then when you are older you play on these buttons a little more subtly, a little more cleverly. But there is no difference. You have not grown up. The ego never grows up, the ego is always childish.\n... DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...\nYou have seen children, stamping their feet, making noise, throwing things on the floor. You have seen women who throw plates in the house at the smallest provocation, drop pots and pans, fill the whole house with noise. ... DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT... That woman is saying I will show you.\nMulla Nasruddin’s wife was running after him – carrying her rolling pin. Mulla got scared and slid under a bed. The wife was fat and couldn’t get under the bed. Mulla sat proudly under the bed. Then somebody knocked on the door, some guest came. The wife quickly hid her rolling pin and said to Mulla, “Come out from there, a guest has come, come out quickly.”\nMulla said, “Let the guests come, today I will show you who runs this house. I will sit wherever I want.”\nThe wife said, “Not so loud!”\nBut Mulla said, “Am I afraid of anyone? Who is master of this house? Today it will be decided – you or me.”\nThe wife said, “Shhh!!! Quiet. Come out from there.”\nBut by this time Mulla’s pride had mounted. He said, “Ask forgiveness, ask ‘please’.”\nShe had to ask please. The guest is at the door and Mulla is sitting under the bed, will it look good? And if he begins to say something sitting under the bed, he starts to speak... she had to say please.\nDON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...\nGorakh is saying, speak meditatively, walk silently. Walk as if you are not. Walk so no one knows it. Don’t walk like a street band playing. Don’t beat your drum.\n... PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE\nPlace your steps so slowly that there is no sound. Come and pass through this world like a gust of wind comes and passes through. No one will get even a whisper of when you came, when you left. Pass through like a silent, empty sound. And you will know god. And you will recognize god.\nThose who are eager to show the world become actors. Out on the street you will find mostly actors. Before leaving their homes, people spend so much time getting ready. Women spend hours standing in front of the mirror. Even the mirror gets tired! The husband is sitting out on the street honking the horn and the wife is still in front of the mirror thinking shall I wear this sari or that sari?\nI was a guest at someone’s house. The husband was taking me to a meeting, he was honking the horn, it was already late. And the wife angrily looked out the window and said, “I have told you a thousand times I am coming in a minute.” If she is going to say it a thousand times, then it will take hours just to say it ... “But this constant horn honking is killing me. Can I put on a sari or not?”\nIn the evening when we came back, I asked her, “At any rate you were going to have to put on a sari. Why did it take so long?”\nShe said, “How could it not take long? Come, I will show you – I have three hundred saris. One has to think it over, consider, which one to wear, this one or that. This has some good qualities, that has other qualities. So it is a problem. Sometimes I put on one then have to change it. So it takes a long time.”\nPeople are actors. This is why other peoples’ wives seem more beautiful than our own wives, because we see our own wives in their natural condition but you see others’ wives on stage – in full costume, all made up...\nMulla Nasruddin says that for birth control no other method is needed, just wives shouldn’t use make-up. It is sufficient. Nothing else is required. This is enough to make the mind disinterested. Remaining spontaneous and natural, enough...\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE.\nDon’t take the world as a stage and don’t get lost in acting here. There is truth also inside – beyond acting. You will know that truth, you will be able to turn towards it, when in your mind you are no longer concerned that others give you attention, whether others pay attention to you or not. When you want others to pay attention to you, you have to pay attention to them. It is a mutual give and take. When will you give attention to yourself? You will have to pay attention to others if you want them to pay attention to you. If you want people to ask how much you paid for the sari you are wearing you will first have to ask about their sari: How much? What a beautiful weave? Where did you buy it? Then the other will ask you. Naturally, it is a world of give and take. If you give attention to others, others give attention to you in response, because they also want to receive attention, the same as you. We go on decorating each others egos – when will you give attention to yourself? You will miss knowing that which is waiting within you – and that is the highest wealth, it is the highest bliss. God is hidden in that consciousness. If you taste that consciousness, you will taste eternal life.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE.\nSomewhere else Gorakh has said:\nTHE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES WHEN THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS FRUITFULLY. THE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY...\nA pot filled with water is still, it does not splash.\nTHE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES\nOne which is half full splashes. A filled water pot doesn’t make noise, a half filled pot makes noise. The more noise you make and stamp your feet, the clearer is the message that you are false. The\nmore you walk like a street band playing, walk raising your flag... ‘let our flag remain on high’ ... the more you show that you are false, you are half... THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES. One who knows, who has had a little experience of life becomes reserved, becomes deep. There is no sound, there is silence around him, a quiet music...\nTHE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES WHEN THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS FRUITFULLY.\nYou make meaningless noise. What else is your speech? There is nothing in your speech because you don’t know anything, what do you have worth saying? But people talk so much, so much nonsense is said. Other people are dumping rubbish in your ears, you are dumping rubbish into others’ ears, rubbish heaped upon rubbish. Pay close attention, ninety percent of what you say the whole day is completely worthless, if it weren’t said it would be okayTHE HALF SOUNDING\nSPLASHES if one which is half filled does not splash what will it do? It creates much noise. People go on talking. The whole world is full of talk: unneeded, meaningless talk.\nGorakh says: WHEN THE SEEKER IS READYOne who knows will speak only to those whose\neagerness to know is clear. A master speaks only to one who is a potential master. He doesn’t speak to each and everyone. It is no use speaking to everyone. A master sits only with those who show a glimpse of being a potential master. A true master speaks to true disciples. He doesn’t speak to each and everyone.\nI am asked why aren’t arrangements made for everyone to come and listen here? There is no need for everyone to come here. I speak to those who have potential. I speak to those who are eager, who are thirsty.\nWHEN THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS FRUITFULLY.\nThen there is some gain in speaking. One who has become enlightened speaks to those who will become enlightened, then there is some gain, otherwise it is just meaningless nonsense.\nGORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nDon’t be an egoist, live naturally, such a small teaching but this is the greatest teaching. Gorakh says, only this much I say to you, if you can understand this, if you can accomplish this then everything will happen.\n... DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nLive spontaneously – what does it mean to live spontaneously? Don’t live through calculations, live out of innocence. Trees are spontaneous, birds and animals are spontaneous, only man is not spontaneous. Where does this unnaturalness come from? I display to people what I am not. I will prove I am what I am not – this is where unnaturalness arises. I am poor but I will make an impression on people of being wealthy. I am ignorant but I will give people the idea that I know. I am nobody but I have a great desire to speak, to be somebody – that ego may someday be fulfilled. So you go on telling people you are what you are not. Inside one thing, outside another. With this deceit you have become unnatural.\nYou can be spontaneous when you drop this trip of the ego. When you say I am like I am – bad then bad, good then good. I am just as god made me. I will not needlessly put on a veil and hide myself. Now your situation is like a wound that you have put a rose flower over and hidden. So you have become unnatural. The wound is within, a rose flower is placed over it. Pus is forming inside. And because of the rose flower the wound cannot heal, it doesn’t receive the sun light, does not get fresh air.\nExpose yourself exactly as you are within. Then you will be spontaneous. Drop your fear. What’s the fear? That people think badly of you? What is the harm? If people won’t pay attention to you, will not respect you, what is lost? What do you get from their respect?\nNATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY, DON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.\nTake care of your being. NATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY... Gorakh Nath says, take care or your soul. Don’t get into useless arguments, I am this, I am that.\nDON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.\nWhat you are you are. God made you this way. Look after this consciousness. NATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY, DON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.\nTHIS WORLD IS A GARDEN OF THORNS, PLACE EACH STEP ALERTLY.\nHere there are great gardens of thorns. Very attractive gardens. From afar they seem flowers. When they prick, you will know they are thorns. From afar they give the illusion of sweet music, but when you come close, when you are trapped, there is trouble. Fish too are caught, seeing the bait. The hook inside the bait is not visible to them either. Others praise you, they are setting bait. There is a thorn in this bait, and now you are caught.\nThis is why flattery has so much power in the world. If you tell the dumbest jackass how intelligent he is, how learned he is, the donkey believes it. The donkey doesn’t question: me, learned and intelligent? He believes it because he wants to. You have said what he was thinking. There is a saying that at the right moment you will call a donkey your father. And the donkey will believe it. And he knows within that he is a donkey and he cannot possibly be your father. But the believing mind says believe it, why are you passing up a chance like this? If you tell a crow he is a sweet singing cuckoo the crow will not deny it. If you flatter him too much and he gets excited then he will caw, caw and prove he is a crow. But he will think that he is sweetly calling out: ‘kuhuu-kuhuu’.\nThis is why flattery has so much influence. If you flatter someone he will be ready to do anything, any job can be done. You also are taken in by flattery, move alertly.\nPLACE EACH STEP ALERTLY...\nTHIS WORLD IS A GARDEN OF THORNS...\nThere are many thorns here. Flowers cover up, thorns are inside. You go to grasp a flower and are pricked by a thorn, then it is difficult to get free. This is how people fall into greed, anger, ego – and they become unspontaneous.\nGORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nAnd pride is a wide road. Don’t think that it is only emperors that are filled with ego, a beggar too has ego. Beggars also have egos.\nI have heard there was a beggar who came daily to Mulla Nasruddin’s lane, for many days he didn’t appear. When he saw him in the market Mulla asked, “You are not seen these days, you used to come daily to harass me. You have harassed for such a long time, for so many years that it has become a habit. Many times I have thought you haven’t come, what has happened? You didn’t come to the door and rap your staff.”\nHe said, “I gave the lane to my son-in-law.” Mulla said, “Meaning?”\nHe said, “That lane was mine. There no other beggar can cause any mischief or I will break his limbs.” He was a cripple, dragging himself along, saying, “I would break their limbs, no beggar can cause mischief there. That lane was mine. I gave it as a dowry – my daughter got married!”\nMulla had thought the lane was his, today he found out who the lane belongs to. Don’t think that only emperors have egos, beggars too have egos. They too have their kingdom, they too have their boundaries. If you enter into their territory, you will be in difficulty. If you beg there you will have to pay taxes to them. If a new beggar begs in the lane of an old beggar he will have to pay taxes.\nNaturally, you might never have thought about it, you never knew which beggar you belong to. There is a beggar on the street who has bought you. He has rights. He has a license to beg from you. If any other beggar begs then he will have to pay taxes. You didn’t know that you have been sold, that the beggar on the street is your master and has rights over you.\nDon’t think that only the rich have egos. Don’t think that only the worldly have egos. Yogis have big egos, renunciates have even bigger egos – they have renounced so much! DON’T BE PROUD... Scholars have big egos.\nGorakh has said:\nMOVING WITHOUT PATH, BURNING WITHOUT FIRE,\nWELL KNOWING GORAKH SAYS, FIGURE THIS OUT O LEARNED PUNDITS.\nHe says, listen you reciting pandits, you parroting pandits. What do you have? But you move arrogantly. Some rubbish, some borrowed stinking words!\nWELL KNOWING GORAKH SAYS...\nGorakh says, I have known from experiencing myself and then I found out that you have only words and nothing else.\n... FIGURE THIS OUT O LEARNED PUNDITS.\nO well-read pundits, O so-called pundits! Figure out what I am saying, come to your senses. MOVING WITHOUT PATH... There is a movement that is without path, where there is no path and the goal arrives. Do you know anything about it? By reading and reciting you have become a pandit, do you know the path that doesn’t exist but the goal comes?\nMOVING WITHOUT PATH, BURNING WITHOUT FIRE...\nDo you know the happening that occurs from a fireless burning? I know a fire like this, that doesn’t exist yet it burns. I know a death, that doesn’t occur, but it happens. I know a goal that has no path to reach it. I know that which is sitting within you. What can be the path to reach there? A path is to take you far away. If god was distant there could be a path. God is you, so what path? You are god himself.\nMOVING WITHOUT PATH...\nThis is why if you stop you will reach.\n... BURNING WITHOUT FIRE...\nAnd this ego is false. To burn it no real fire is needed. If you understand this then the fire of understanding is enough, and it burns.\nGorakh says, my teaching is very direct – of spontaneity. As Kabir has said, based on Gorakh: “O Seeker, the natural samadhi is best.”\nSWAMI, GOING TO THE FOREST HUNGER ARISES, GOING TO THE CITY MAYA ARISES.\nHe is saying, O swamis, O escapist sannyasins! If you go to the jungle hunger will catch you. Then sitting in the jungle twenty-four hours a day you will think of food. Who knows if anyone will give it. Will anyone bring it or not? And if you go to the town you will be caught in maya, caught in illusion, caught in attachment, caught in desire. You will see a beautiful woman passing by and you will be fascinated. You will see a beautiful house and desire will arise – if only it were mine! If you stay in the city maya will catch you. If you go to the jungle to be saved from maya, hunger catches you. What will you do? You are in great difficulty.\nSTUFFING YOURSELF, SEXUAL DESIRE ARISES...\nIf you over eat, really stuff yourself, sex desire will be created from this stuffing, from the extra food. If you eat more than is necessary, it creates desire inside of you. Why does it create desire? Because you will not be able to contain the extra energy you have taken into yourself, it wants to go out, it is superfluous, it is not needed, it is burdensome.\nWhat is desire? A way for energy to go out. What is sex? A way to throw out energy. When you have too much energy that you cannot contain, it will begin to flow out on its own. It has to flow out. A container can be filled with only as much water as it contains. If it is filled more, it will overflow. Desire is the energy that overflows your vessel, this is why if you eat too much you will be caught in sex desire. Now it is very difficult. If you eat too little you will remember all kinds of food day and night.\nSo what will you do? What is the way? Be spontaneous Gorakh says. Come to the middle. Eat as much as is necessary. Don’t go to the jungle, because there you will be hungry. Don’t play around so much in the city that besides city nothing remains of you, because desire will catch you there. But how to live? Live in the city like someone living in the jungle, this is the middle. Live at home like one lives in the forest. Live in the world but don’t let the world inside of you. Live as a lotus leaf in the water.\n... WHY WASTE THIS BODY BORN OF PASSION?\nThen you will know how this body created from egg and sperm attains the state of enlightenment! Then you will know. If you have chosen to go to the jungle because you are afraid desire will catch you in the city, then hunger will catch you. If you are afraid hunger will catch you in the jungle, come to the city... and wherever you go, it will be city or jungle, there is no other possibility. If out of duality you choose one, then you will not be able to remain with it very long, because the needs of the opposite will begin to pull you, will begin to attract you.\nSo eat the right amount of food – what is sufficient for meditation, sufficient for worship and prayer. Eat rightly, give to the body what is needed for natural functions. Don’t dump more, otherwise the extra amount will put you in trouble. Don’t go to extremes.\nThere are some people who overeat, stuffing and forcing food. Their whole work is food, food, food... they don’t do anything else. Then superfluous energy arises from the extra food. Then the release of energy is necessary, otherwise the energy will be a burden, will become a load. Then go into desire. Then the energy flows out in desire. Then people are so drowned in desire that whatever energy they had flows out in it. Then they become empty, emptied out. Then they fill up with food because now they are empty, now emptiness aggravates. This becomes a great disturbance. From one extreme to the other extreme, from the other back to the first, from the first back to the second, going on swinging like this, like the pendulum of a clock. The clock of life goes on. Your coming and going continues. Stop in the middle. Have you ever stopped the pendulum of a clock and seen what happens? As soon as the pendulum stops the clock stops. Coming and going has stopped. Time has stopped. Time has stopped means the world has stopped.\nDON’T ATTACK YOUR FOOD, DON’T DIE OF HUNGER, CONTEMPLATE THE SECRET OF BRAHMAN DAY AND NIGHT\nDON’T OVERWORK, DON’T LIE AROUND, THUS SAYS GORAKH DEVA\nA plain and simple sutra, but such that if it finds its mark it will land in your heart like an arrow and your life will be transformed.\nDON’T ATTACK YOUR FOOD...\nDon’t eat fuller and fuller, don’t burst with food! DON’T ATTACK YOUR FOOD...\nDon’t launch an attack.\n... DON’T DIE OF HUNGER...\nAnd don’t die of hunger either. Don’t starve. Don’t fast.\n... CONTEMPLATE THE SECRET OF BRAHMA DAY AND NIGHT\nLive rightly and assimilate the secret of the ultimate day and night. This whole universe is filled with mystery, it is overflowing with the beauty of the highest. The blessings of that highest are present everywhere. In these rays of sunlight, in the specks of sunlight falling on the leaves, in green leaves, in flowers, in birds, in people, this vast life, drink his mystery, fill yourself with it.\nO my heart, speak of Him! In comparison to his face, All colors and shapes pale;\nI have become sated with him – Drinking his water of compassion;\nFloat on him wave after wave, flow with him! O my heart, speak of Him!\nHis fluid nimble way of moving, Is unique in the whole world; His sweet sweet voice –\nHow beautiful to me;\nBecome his shadow, live every moment with him! O my heart, speak of Him!\nThe bliss of his spontaneous closeness, Is a trust of life;\nBut if the hour comes –\nof parting company with the beloved;\nThen deep within will I bear the fire of distance from him! O my heart, speak of Him!\nRemember the divine. Don’t become a glutton, and against gluttony don’t always be starving and fasting. Remember again the story of Shrona – when the strings of the veena of life are neither too tight nor too loose music arises. This music is a song of devotion. This music is kirtan. This music is remembrance.\nO my heart, speak of Him!\nRemember the divine. Assimilate his secret. And his secret is overflowing, it is whispered in every direction.\nYour laughing call, O bird of songs! Spread freedom’s wings\nSound the conch of life,\nAnd you join with eager speed This painted sky!\nSoar beyond the horizon Send a piercing ray\nOpen the heavenly gates of your heart And you rain a shower of nectar\nThis pattering melody!\nSecret sky of subtle intelligence Drink the soma nectar of eternity, And you sing your drunken bliss, This immortal, alone!\nWatch the moon, watch the sun, Let the trumpet of truth proclaim,\nAnd distinctions of this world are kidnapped O destroyer of illusions!\nSlough the skin of darkness\nKiss the thousand petalled radiance of the crown, And you awaken in the cave of the navel\nO supine serpent!\nIt is he outside, it is he inside. Just sink a little into his mystery. It is he seen rising in the trees, he appears showering light in the moon and stars. He is moving in your every breath, he is hidden in every beat of your heart. It is he who pervades your consciousness – drink up his mystery.\nThe more a person is filled with the beauty of the universe the closer he reaches to god. All this beauty is his.\nDON’T OVERWORK, DON’T LIE AROUND, THUS SAYS GORAKH DEVA\nAnd don’t be stubborn. Don’t try to force the body more than necessary. DON’T OVERWORK...\nDon’t make too much effort otherwise you will become tired and broken. But also don’t do the reverse: ... DON’T LIE AROUND...\nDon’t become lazy. Don’t just lie there thinking: “We shouldn’t make effort, shouldn’t exert ourselves So I’ll just lie around.”\nNow what is to be done? Between the two... Act, as if inactive. Do, but don’t become the doer. Let him be the doer, you are merely his vessel, only a medium... as Krishna said to Arjuna in the Geeta, just become a medium. The doer is god, become a bow string in his hands. If he shoots arrows with you then arrows, and if he offers worship in the temple with you, then worship.\nDon’t be over active... like people who believe in the yoga of good acts, they become over active. And don’t be too inactive. There is a yoga of inaction too. This too has become a belief. Such people also find support from the scriptures, from the songs of the sant mystics. They extract their own meanings. For instance Baba Maluk has said:\nBoas never hold a job, birds have never worked; Das Maluka says, no need, Rama provides for all.\nLazy people have extracted their meaning from this. They have made a very beautiful interpretation. They say, it is good, then we will lie around happily as big snakes lie around. So some sadhus and sants just lie around. They think, what is there to to? Baba Maluk has said that “existence provides for all.” If it provides it provides... relax and believe in fate.\nThis whole country has died believing in fate. Laziness has spread through this whole country. This whole country has become indolent and idle. And it has given it’s indolence and idleness a very\nspiritual color by saying it is fate, what happens is what is meant to happen. If one is poor one is poor. A beggar then a beggar, a slave then a slave. Everything happens by fate. When he wishes it then everything will be made well, but we have to drag along.\nThe suffering of this country is that we have taken up this sutra – of laziness. We are lying down. The misery of the West is that they have taken up action, taken it up so much that they can’t sleep at night – they have forgotten how. Now they cannot sleep without sleeping pills. They have become so active, so many waves have arisen, the mind is moving so much that they lay down on the bed at night but the mind has forgotten sleep even exists. It goes right on thinking. It makes calculations, does accounting, makes plans: tomorrow’s shop, tomorrow’s market, tomorrow’s world. It remains absorbed in its plans. This way the night is lost.\nThe West is going crazy because of too much activity. And the East has become poor because of too much inactivity. If what Gorakh says is understood then there is no need to go crazy and no need to be poor.\nGorakh says:\nDON’T OVERWORK, DON’T LIE AROUND, THUS SAYS GORAKH DEVA.\nI tell you to be in between. Work but from a state of no work. Enter into work, but peacefully, silently... so that work does not make you restless. Work but don’t go insane in it.\nOVER EATING STRENGTHENS THE SENSES, DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE MIND WITH SEX.\nIf you eat too much food the senses will be strengthened and awareness will be destroyed.\n... DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE MIND WITH SEX.\nAnd the more awareness is destroyed the more nothing but sex remains in the mind. Understand this. The more the amount of awareness increases the more the amount of sex decreases. The more the amount of awareness decreases the more the amount of sex increases. These two are always influencing each other.\nMake an experiment and see. If you eat too much then unconsciousness overtakes you, immediately sleep starts coming. This is why sleep starts coming after eating. Remain some night without eating, then sleep will not come the whole night. You didn’t eat so unconsciousness does not overtake you. This is why to one who fasts sleep doesn’t come at night. Or sleep becomes less. In old age sleep becomes less because food becomes less. The body cannot digest so much food. Life is finishing so now there is no need for sleep either. Unconsciousness takes over in sleep. For sleep it is necessary that your body remain more powerful than your being, only then can sleep take over. When you eat the body grows, the being becomes weak. If you eat too much then the body becomes very burdensome, you start getting drowsy.\nWhen consciousness increases, you will find simultaneously that sex desire has started becoming less, because the pressure of the body becomes less on the being. This is why Gorakh and I do not\ntell you to fight against sex desire, we tell you to awaken awareness. Become more alert. Whatever you do, do it with alertness. If you go into sex, go into it alertly, go into it consciously. And you will be surprised, as consciousness increases, sex desire will become weak by itself. One day you will suddenly find that without repressing, without fighting that you don’t know where sex stopped – when you go within to look for it, you don’t find it. Everything within has become lit with awakening.\nSex and meditation have the same relationship as light and darkness. If a lamp is lit, darkness is ended. There is no need to throw out darkness. Who can throw it out? How can it be thrown? Can anyone throw it out? Only a lamp is to be lit. This is why the people who fight with sex desire have gotten into very foolish activity. Fight with desire and it will increase. You will be more possessed by it. No one has ever fought darkness and won. Cutting it with a sword doesn’t work. Beating it with a staff makes no sense. Give it a shove, collect all the strong men of the village, still you won’t be able to push the darkness out of a small hut. But light one small lamp and you won’t even know where the darkness has gone. Darkness is not a thing, darkness is negative. Darkness is only an absence, the absence of light. If light becomes present, it is done. There was no darkness, nor has it gone anywhere: only light was missing, light has come.\nSex is the absence of meditation. If the lamp of meditation is lit: enough, sex is gone.\nHere people ask me, “You don’t teach people brahmacharya – to be celibate? Brahmacharya cannot be taught. Only meditation can be taught. Brahmacharya is the result. As meditation ripens, brahmacharya comes to fruit by itself. All effort is to be put into meditation. One who puts his effort directly into brahmacharya will sit suppressing sex in the name of brahmacharya. And brahmacharya is not happening – it is only superficial – within the being the worms of desire are crawling. Inside the snake of desire will raise its hood. His life will become very unnatural. His life will become very difficult. Peace will not arise in his life, nor will equanimity come. He will fall deep into duality. A continuous struggle will go on turning within him. And how can there be experience of god while struggling? A non-dual mind is needed, only then is the experience of god possible.\nOVER EATING STRENGTHENS THE SENSES, DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE MIND WITH SEX.\nSLEEP OVERTAKES, DEATH CLOSES IN...\nSleep catches you, death catches you.\n... THE HEART ENTANGLED.\nAnd then trouble always created within, a disturbance continues to be raised. An insanity goes on increasing. Just look inside yourself and see how mad you are. Madness goes on there. Living in this madness how will you know the truth? It is impossible! This madness must go. And there is only one way for this madness to go – LAUGHING, PLAYING THE KNACK OF MEDITATION. Laugh, play, dance, be ecstatic and keep meditating. This is enough, it will go.\nTHE MILK DIETER MONK’S MIND ON OTHERS’ COWS...\nThere are a few people who have decided to consume milk only. They think milk is the purest food.\nI was a guest for some time in Raipur. There is a community there – of the milk drinkers sect. Milk is the only diet of the people living there. They thought they would be healthier with milk. Have you gone mad? In the first place, the milk you are drinking has not been produced for you. You drink cow’s milk, no? It is produced for calves. It is for growing bulls. Milk is not a pure food. From milk, sex desire will awaken. And sex desire like that of a bull – not just a little, because god made it for a bull not for you.\nAnd the nature of milk is to be a provision for the child, so the child can get milk until he can digest food. After a certain age no animal drinks milk, with the exception of man. Man makes unnatural arrangements. To drink a little in tea, a little in coffee is okay, but don’t become a milk dieter.\nWhen I was in Raipur a priest from the milk diet community came to meet me. He asked, “How to become victorious over sexual desire?”\nI said, “First drop this milk diet, drop this practice. To be a man is bad enough, you will become a bull! ... and you take nothing but milk. People go on bringing milk because the saints drink nothing but milk... pure food. What is pure about milk?\nJust a few days ago there was a report in the newspapers that meat has been produced from milk in Japan. Milk is a part of the blood, this is why meat can be made from it. Scientists have succeeded in creating meat from milk. Within two or three months white meat produced from milk will be available in Japanese markets. Milk contains the same substance that is in meat. This is why flesh increases from drinking milk, blood improves, a person becomes robust.\nWhere do you think the milk comes from when a child is born from the mother’s womb? As blood passes through her breasts it begins to produce milk. In this way blood is available to the child. And the child cannot digest anything else. It is good for him at this age. There is not such purity in milk as you think there is. There is greater purity in fruits, greater purity in wheat, rice, beans.\nGorakh says, THE MILK DRINKER MONK’S MIND ON OTHERS’ COWS...\nDon’t become a milk dieter. Otherwise the milk drinker has always to pay attention which house he will get milk from, which house he will not get it from. ... MIND ON OTHER’S COWS... His attention is continuously on others’ houses. Whose cow is good, whose cow is bad...\nOnce I was travelling with a sadhu. He would drink only the milk of a white cow. I said, “You have gone mad. Use a little common sense. Milk from a black cow doesn’t turn black, milk is always white. Are you afraid of a black cow because the milk might become black?”\n“No,” he said, “No, I am... my guru suggested milk of a white cow.”\nWhether the skin of the cow is white or black what difference is there in the milk? Then the milk of black women would be black, and the milk of white women would be white. Milk is white, but nothing becomes pure just by being white.\nHave you seen herons? Herons of Indian politics fishing in pure white homespun khadi? Mulla Nasruddin went into the market one day wearing khadi shirt and vest, wearing khadi hat and fine cut pajamas. And someone said, “Mulla, what a clean white!”\nMulla said, “Don’t be deceived, no matter how white the clothes are, the heart is mine, still black as ever.”\nThe heart does not become white from clothes being white, nor does anyone’s soul become pure from drinking white milk.\nBut people create problems. That sadhu travelling with me was in great difficulty. First he had to circle all around the cow and check that there was no black spot or anything on the cow. If the cow was completely white, then before milking it someone had to bathe. They should milk it wearing wet clothing so they remained in a freshly bathed condition. His followers had to milk wearing wet clothes. They were shivering. It was winter, they went on shivering and milking... And he consumed only milk and thought he was doing something very virtuous.\nI said, “You will fall into hell. They will all make complaints against you, these people freezing in the cold. Someone will get pneumonia, someone will catch a cold – it is all being done for you. You will suffer the fruit of bad karma. Now you are shocked, but it is better you are careful.”\nTHE MILK DIETER MONK’S MIND ON OTHER’S COWS, THE NAKED ALWAYS NEED FIREWOOD.\nAnd those who have gone naked need wood to burn everyday. Is a blanket worse than this? Are clothes worse than this? You live naked so you burn wood. This is greater violence, because to burn wood you have to cut trees. And his mind is continually concerned with getting firewood each day. He needs his holy fire burning twenty-four hours a day because he lives naked. The fire goes on burning. And how many insects are dying in the fire? Trees are cut, insects die in the fire..what was wrong with wearing clothes? Why are you creating troubles?\nGorakh says let life be spontaneous. These are unnatural things. Now their minds are caught up in meaningless things: Will I get firewood today or not? Will I find a white cow or not? Will I get milk or not? Will I get enough milk or not? Make life simple, not complex. Be natural, be ordinary. Don’t buy into things that give your mind useless worries.\nTHE MONK IN SILENCE DESIRES A COMPANION...\nAnd the one who vows silence, he wants someone to move with him, he always needs a companion.\nA friend came to meet me, a silent Muni Maharaj. He brought someone with him to interpret his signs and tell me. I said, “Why don’t you speak directly?”\nHis companion said, “No, he has taken a vow of silence, he doesn’t speak directly.” I said, “This is an additional problem. Now you have to go wherever he goes.”\nHe said, “Yes, I have to go. And Muni Maharaj never touches money either, I have to keep the money. If we take a rickshaw or taxi I have to give the money. He doesn’t touch money.”\n“But whose money is it?” I asked.\n“The money is his. People give it to him, but I hold it. People offer it at his feet, I quickly collect it.” I said, “Does Muni Maharaj keep track of it?”\nHe said, “How can I hide anything from you? He goes on watching, goes on counting how many notes have come. With hand signs he says a five keep it carefully.” Why this useless nonsense? When you are going to count it anyway, count it yourself and keep it in your own pocket? You have to count it and keep it in someone else’s pocket and then keep worrying whether he will run away, whether he will change his mind by the morning.\nI said to him, “Come tomorrow to the meditation.” It was in Bombay. Meditations were being held at Birla Matushri’s. So I said, “Come tomorrow morning for the meditation.”\nHe said – he made gestures and had his friend say, “He cannot come, because I will not be available in the morning, I am going somewhere else. He cannot come without me. Who will take care of the taxi? Who will seat him? Who will help him out? He doesn’t speak.”\nYou have become lame by your own hand. God has given you feet, has given you a tongue. But you have refused them! And you are using a tongue, it too is god’s tongue, in the other man’s mouth. Your tongue is also god’s. What sense is there in renouncing a closer tongue to use one further away? But people are caught up in such disturbances, in such entanglements.\nTHE MONK IN SILENCE DESIRES A COMPANION...\nHe always needs a companion.\n... NO DEPTH WITHOUT THE MASTER’S SHELTER.\nThis is all useless nonsense because without finding a master these people will not find the real thread of life. They have gotten into this nonsense from reading books, reading scriptures.\nPlace your hopes in one who has found,\nHow can thirst be slaked from an empty river? Rahim’s expression is beautiful!\n... in one who has found,\nYou can get something only from someone who has it. How can thirst be slaked from an empty river?\nIs there water in the scriptures? There are nothing but words. Thoughts about water, descriptions of water, but where is the water? Only with a master can you get the secret formula, the sutra, the key.\nA couplet of Gorakh,\nHIS FRAGRANCE AND SWEETNESS PERVADE THE WHOLE WORLD. THE TRUTH IS, ONLY A MASTER WHO HAS SEEN, CAN HELP YOU SEE.\nGorakh says god is the fragrance filling the entire universe. From his fragrance the whole universe is made fragrant.\nHIS FRAGRANCE AND SWEETNESS PERVADE THE WHOLE WORLD.\nAnd his sweetness is in this whole world, but unless you meet someone to show you, how will you taste it? Unless you meet someone to tell you, how will his fragrance reach our nostrils? How will his music connect with our ears?\nTHE TRUTH IS, ONLY A MASTER WHO HAS SEEN, CAN HELP YOU SEE.\nThe truth is that until you meet a seer, one who has seen, you cannot be connected to god.\n... NO DEPTH WITHOUT THE MASTER’S SHELTER.\nWithout a master faith will not come, trust will not come. Only a seer can provoke this self trust that yes, god is. Only a seer can be a witness – an eye witness.\nWithout finding a master nothing can be attained. People have fallen into these useless troubles. And the master’s message is small, a small sutra: be spontaneous.\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE. GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nA small sutra, drop the ego, live simply. Don’t be extreme, come to the middle, a natural state...\nLISTEN VIRTUOUS ONE, LISTEN INTELLIGENT ONE, TO THIS CALL OF NUMBERLESS SIDDHAS.\nTHE DISCIPLE BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT IS OVER.\nGorakh said, if you can listen, listen; if you can understand, understand. LISTEN VIRTUOUS ONE...\nIf you have a little capacity, you have a little intelligence, listen.\n... LISTEN INTELLIGENT ONE...\nIf you have a little awareness, then grasp this.\n... THIS CALL OF NUMBERLESS SIDDHAS.\nAnd not only I am saying it, numberless enlightened people have said it.\nTHE DISCIPLE BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT IS OVER.\nEnough, if the disciple bows down, he meets the master. As soon as the disciple bows he meets the master. The master is always present, if you bow you meet the master.\nThere is an ancient Egyptian saying that whenever the disciple is ready the master appears. There is not a moment’s waiting. The disciple bows, the master comes.\nIN THE DISCIPLE’S BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT IS OVER.\nThen this world of night is no more night, then it passes in wakefulness.\nUnderstand these small sutras, comprehend them and practice them a little in your life, taste them. I finish today’s talk with a couplet of Rahim,\nRAHIM A STONE IN WATER, SUBMERGED BUT NEVER SOAKED\nLIKE FOOLISH PEOPLE, WHO UNDERSTAND BUT DON’T SEEK LIVING INSIGHTS.\nLike a stone lying in the river, but still doesn’t get soaked. The same way foolish people sit in satsang but don’t get soaked.\nRAHIM A STONE IN WATER, SUBMERGED BUT NEVER SOAKED\nIt remains submerged, remains under water but doesn’t get soaked, just remains untouched. Lying in the water it remains untouchable.\nLIKE FOOLISH PEOPLE, WHO UNDERSTAND BUT DON’T SEEK LIVING INSIGHTS.\nOne who sits in satsang listening, listening to the words but doesn’t experience. ‘... understand without living insight.’ He listens, he understands but doesn’t live it, doesn’t experience it. Know he is a fool, he is a stone.\nThis is satsang. Get soaked, drown, live it...!\nDON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE. GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.\nEnough for today?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"13855","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/>Death is Divine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 Live spontaneously</h1><div class=post-meta>66 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;13855 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Death_is_Divine/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

reality, it is your acting. Ego is not your truth it is your belief. In
a drama, when someone is cast as Rama he doesn’t become Rama, in the
same way you are cast here as something which you are not. A vast drama
goes on. When you were born you didn’t come with a name. A name was
given to you and you became that name. You didn’t come with any
knowledge when you were born. You were taught and made to study, you
went to school, to college. Many thoughts were poured into your brain.
You were thrown into knowledge. Then you began to think it is your
knowledge. Nothing in all this is yours. Everything is borrowed,
everything is stale leftovers. Your name is not yours, your knowledge is
not yours. The intelligence that you think is yours is not yours – it
too has been constructed from others. If someone says you are very
beautiful you fall for it. And if someone says you are simply
incomparable you fall for that. If anyone praises you, you wrap it up to
keep it. If anyone insults you you’re hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Your personality is constructed from others opinions. It is the
creation of other hands. Others have brought their brushes and painted
you. And if you accept this as your being you will never be able to know
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, DIE, OH YOGI, DIE! Let this false form die, so you can
experience your real form. Let your mask fall away. It is good if this
clothing burns to ash, so your truth, naked, can manifest in</p><p>its naturalness. Until the ego is gone there will be no experience of
being. And one who does not experience his own being, his soul, how will
he become conscious of the soul of existence?</p><p><br></p><p>Soul is a drop, existence is the ocean. If you experience the drop
you begin to experience the ocean too, because the ocean is hidden in
the drop. And what else is the ocean than combined drops?</p><p><br></p><p>You are a ray, god is the sun. And the sun is nothing but the
combining of rays. God is the combination of all of us. God is the
totality of all of us. You go out searching for god but you don’t
destroy the ego. You have not yet recognized even this one ray but you
go in search of the sun? You will wander much... Right now you are
false, whatever you find will also be false. The false cannot reach the
truth, the false will reach only greater falsities.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is false, a drama. Whatever you do while this drama is
running will be illusory. Make vows, do ascetic practices, control,
fast; abandon your home and go to the jungle. Nothing will come of it.
Your ego will receive new ornaments from all of these. It will become
more beautified, better arranged. Your ego will not die, it will get
more life, become more nourished. And until the ego dies, there is no
experience of being. To experience being the ego must be lost.</p><p><br></p><p>DIE, OH YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, the death I am telling you about is very sweet. If one
dies this death, life is nothing but sweetness. Truth is very sweet when
you experience it. It is the taste of nectar. It spreads in the body and
heart, you are filled with it. It begins overflowing. Certainly one who
has received the truth is himself fulfilled. But droplets of fulfillment
also start falling on those who are near him, lightly showering on those
who sit in his shelter. But one must die – this is the condition.</p><p><br></p><p>If the false dies, the truth is born. Truth is present within, but
imprisoned in a wall of lies. Clouds of lies have hidden the sun of
truth. It has not been destroyed. What lie can destroy the truth? It is
not lost either, it has been forgotten. It is like a veil over someone’s
face, the face is not destroyed, it is veiled, it is simply not
visible.</p><p><br></p><p>We have hidden our being behind the veil of ego. People think there
is a veil covering the mystery of existence. They are wrong. The veil is
on your eyes. The veil is covering you, existence is completely
unveiled. Existence is naked all around you but you need eyes to see
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s sutra is about how this sweet death happens. What is the
process? What is its essential discipline? ... sutras about this. How
can we die? What is Gorakh’s death like? DIE THAT DEATH...</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone dies. But there are differences in dying. You will die,
Buddha also dies, but there is a difference between your dying and
Buddha’s. You will die only from the body and save your ego, your lie,
taking it with you – it will adorn your mind like a treasure. Your ego
will enter a new womb. You will die, your mind will not die. And nothing
changes until the mind dies. Masks change, houses change but the journey
is the same, just going round and round like an old ox in a grist mill.
You have died many times, and you have been born again many times.
Hardly have you died when you start being born again.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego hides all your diseases inside itself, enters a new womb, and
starts taking a new body. But the desires are old, the diseases are old,
the miseries are old, the ruts are old. You move ahead,</p><p>get tired again, fall again, die again, this has happened many times.
Buddha also dies, but there is a difference between his dying and your
dying. Your ego does not die, it only abandons the body. He dissolves
his ego, burns up his ego. Before the body is abandoned he abandons his
ego. One who dies before dying, experiences the ultimate life. Then he
has no need to come back again, because the very thread that used to
pull him back has died.</p><p><br></p><p>Being has no birth, no death. The ego is born, only the ego dies. And
one who is released from ego is eternal. Then he doesn’t die, he isn’t
born. One living, changeless, beyond time. Then you are as big as the
sky. This is your nature.</p><p><br></p><p>DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why he says, don’t think that I am talking about ordinary
dying. Everyone dies ordinary deaths: birds and animals die, plants die,
mountains die. Gorakh is not talking about this death, he is talking
about a special death – die in samadhi, die in meditation. Let the ego
go and dissolve into meditation. As long as the ego exists one cannot
dissolve in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the secret of the ego’s living? If this is understood, then
the art of its dying will also be understood. The ego lives in extremes.
Extremes are the life force of the ego. Perhaps you have never
considered it, thought it over, looked at it with awareness that the
abode of the ego is in extremes. More, more, more... this is the ego’s
way of life. Ten thousand rupees should become one hundred thousand, one
hundred thousand should become one million. More, more, more... ego
lives in this insanity. The ego lives in extremes. And the extreme can
be of anything, whether it’s money or knowledge, power or renunciation –
but more.</p><p><br></p><p>One who has done a thirty day fast thinks next time he will do a
forty day fast. One who has fasted forty days thinks next time he will
fast fifty days. What is the difference? One who has forty million
rupees thinks it should become fifty million. What is the difference?
One who has started eating only twice a day instead of three times,
thinks when should I begin eating only once? One who eats only once
thinks, how can I be finished with eating even once?</p><p><br></p><p>A youth was brought to me. He wanted to know how he could live only
on water. He didn’t want to take anything else, because anything else is
indulgence. How to live only on water? He had withered. He had come to
India from America in search of someone to tell him the secret of living
on water. I said, “If I tell you the secret how to live on water will
you be satisfied?”</p><p><br></p><p>He closed his eyes and thought. He was a thoughtful youth. He kept on
sitting for about half an hour. Then he said, “No, then I would ask how
can one live on air.” Only on air, why even this nuisance of water?</p><p><br></p><p>Such is the desire of the mind, the running of the ego – for more.
What direction you run makes no difference. The ego lives in extremes,
whether it is the extreme of money or renunciation, the extreme of
indulgence or yoga. Stop in the middle and the ego will die. This is why
Buddha calls his path majjhim nikaya, the middle path, exactly in the
center.</p><p><br></p><p>A youth, Prince Shrona, was initiated by Buddha. The people in the
capital could not believe it. No one had ever imagined that Shrona would
become a bhikkhu, a monk. Buddha’s monks could not</p><p>believe it either, their eyes were popping out when Shrona came and
fell at Buddha’s feet and said, “Initiate me, make me a bhikkhu.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shrona was an emperor, and a famous emperor. He was famous for
indulgence. His royal palace had the most beautiful women of that era.
His palace had the finest wines, gathered from every corner of the
world. Celebration went on all night long, he slept all day. He was so
drowned in indulgence that no one had ever thought he could imagine
becoming a sannyasin. When he climbed the steps he didn’t have railings
put up, but had naked women stand there. He would climb the stairs
putting his hand on their shoulders. He made his house into a heaven.
His palace was such that gods in heaven would be jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>The bhikkhus asked Buddha, “We can’t believe it, Shrona being
initiated!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Whether you believe it or not, I knew he was going to
take sannyas. To tell you the truth it is for him that I came to the
capital today. What goes to one extreme will go to the other extreme
too. Indulgence is one extreme, he did that completely. Now there is no
way to move further there, no way to satisfy the ego. He has whatever is
possible in that world. Now a wall has come in front of the ego, where
can the ego go now? The ego demands more. Now there isn’t any more, so
the ego must return, must go back in the opposite direction. When the
pendulum of a clock goes all the way to the right, it must return
towards the left. Then it goes all the way to the left and has to return
again to the right. When the pendulum of a clock is going to the left,
remember that it is gathering momentum to go to the right. And when it
is going to the right it is gathering momentum to go to the left. One
who has a subtle vision will be able to see this. One who goes into
extreme indulgence will one day go into extreme yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Wait a few days, you will see the truth of what I am
saying.”</p><p><br></p><p>And people saw. The other bhikkhus walked on a well paved road, but
Shrona walked through thorns and brush, his feet became drenched in
blood. When the sun was hot the other bhikkhus sat in the shade of the
trees. Shrona would stand in the sun. The other bhikkhus wore clothes,
he used only a loin cloth. And it seemed as if he was eager to drop the
loin cloth too. Then one day he did drop it. The other bhikkhus ate once
a day, Shrona ate only once in two days. The other bhikkhus ate sitting
down. Shrona ate standing up. The other bhikkhus kept a bowl, Shrona
didn’t keep even a bowl, only his hand... he ate only the food that fit
in his hand. His beautiful body shrivelled. Previously people used to
come from miles around to see his body. His face had been very charming,
immensely beautiful. After he had been a bhikkhu for three months anyone
who saw him would not recall that this was Emperor Shrona. His feet
became blistered, his body became black, he shrivelled and became just
bones. And he went on disciplining himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Do you see bhikkhus, I had told you that what goes to
one extreme, will go to the other extreme! It is difficult to stop in
the middle, because the middle is the death of the ego.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Shrona stopped eating. Then he stopped taking water. He
continued from one extreme to another. It seemed he would be a guest on
this earth only two or three more days, then die. This is when Buddha
went to his door, to the tree under which he had built a hut to rest in.
He was lying down. Buddha said to him, “Shrona, I have come to ask you
something. I have heard that when you were an emperor you had a passion
for playing the veena, and that you were very skilled at playing</p><p>it, that you took great interest in the veena. I have come to ask you
a question: when the strings of the veena are very loose, will music
arise or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shrona said, “What are you talking about? You know it well, if the
strings are very loose music cannot arise, they cannot even sound a
twang.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Then I ask you this: if the strings are tightened too
much will music arise or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shrona said, “If they are tightened too much the strings will snap,
music will not arise, only the sound of snapping strings will arise. How
can music arise from the sound of an instrument breaking?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Buddha said, “I have come to remind you. Just as you have
experienced the veena, I experience the veena of life. I say unto you,
if the strings of life are very tight music does not arise, and if the
strings of life are very loose, again music does not arise. The strings
need to be in the middle Shrona, neither too tight nor too loose. The
greatest skill of a musician is in bringing the strings exactly to the
middle, this is what is meant by tuning an instrument.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is why when you see Indian classical music, it takes half an
hour or an hour to tune the instruments. Tuning instruments is a great
art. To bring the strings to that middle point where it cannot be said
that they are too loose or too tight, one needs great skill, a very
sensitive ear. Only a connoisseur of music is able to tune.</p><p><br></p><p>“The veena of life is exactly the same,” Buddha said, “It is enough
Shrona, wake up now. I was waiting to let you come to the extreme. At
first your strings were very loose, now you have tightened them too
much. Music didn’t happen then, nor does it happen now: are you
experiencing samadhi? What is all this that you are doing? Previously
you stuffed yourself, now you are fasting to death. Previously you never
went barefoot, if you went anywhere the road was covered with velvet.
And now if the path is good you will not move on it. You move in the
brush, in the thorns, on rough, rugged paths. Perhaps previously you had
never drunk water but only wine. Now you are afraid to drink even water!
Now you want to avoid water too. Previously at your house incomparable
meat dishes were prepared, now you are not ready even to eat dry bread.
See how you have moved from one extreme to the other? That extreme was
unmusical, this too is unmusical. I call out to you: Now is the time,
come to the middle.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tears began to flow from Shrona’s eyes. He became alert. He saw his
situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s sutras are sutras for bringing the strings of the veena to
the middle. And as soon as someone comes to the middle, the ego dies –
it cannot live. The ego is a disease, the ego can exist only if your
mind is sick. The life of the ego comes out of your being sick, and
extremes are the secret of your being sick.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also saying to my sannyasins, I give you the lesson of the veena
strings of life – the middle. Be in the world as if you are not in the
world. The world will not control you, nor is there any need to renounce
it and escape. Neither become indulgent nor a yogi, stay in the middle.
Don’t run after money, nor renounce money and run away, stop in the
middle, exactly in the middle, where there are no extremes. There you
will find music resounding! The veena comes to life. The unstruck sound
starts echoing.</p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET
WITH CARE. DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...</p><p>All those who have written commentaries and annotations for this
sutra give it the meaning: don’t speak without thinking. That meaning
does not seem right to me. Linguistically it is correct: you should not
immediately speak, when someone says something you shouldn’t answer
abruptly, you should think it over then answer. Linguistically the
meaning is right, but existentially the meaning is not right. Replying
after thinking about it means that the answer will not be spontaneous,
it will be thought out – in the next line Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Their interpretation does not fit with living spontaneously. Living
would become very unspontaneous. Then the answer you give would be
thought out and arranged, not spontaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>A spontaneous reply, spontaneous speech is something entirely
different. It is not related to thinking. Whenever you think it over
your answer becomes unspontaneous. Someone asks something, before
answering you examine everything: what you should say, what you
shouldn’t say; what will make a good impression, what will make a bad
impression; who will gain from it, who will be harmed by it. If you
speak after thinking over and calculating all this your expression will
no longer have spontaneity. Your expression will become false.
Spontaneous expression comes from no-thought.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...</p><p><br></p><p>Others say this means to speak thoughtfully. And I say it means speak
from no-thought, speak wakefully. To speak abruptly indicates
unconsciousness. Stay aware inside, let the lamp of awareness keep
burning, let your attention be alert. Don’t speak thoughtfully, speak
from no-thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Note these two expressions – speak ‘thoughtlessly’ and speak from
‘no-thought.’ Thoughtlessly speaking means saying whatever comes into
your mouth and repenting afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a guest one night at a friend’s house. Anand Swami an old
disciple of Mahatma Gandhi was also a guest at the house. We were in the
same room in the evening. Everyone in the house gathered. A conversation
started. I asked Anand Swami what had impressed him about Mahatma
Gandhi, because he had dedicated his whole life to Gandhi. He said, “The
first impression Gandhi made on me was when Gandhi came to India from
Africa. He gave a statement to the press in Ahmedabad. I was working as
a newspaper reporter, a journalist. In his statement he said some vulgar
words against the English. I took the vulgar words out of his statement
and the report that was given in the newspapers contained no swear words
at all. The next day Gandhi called for me, slapped me on the back and
said, ‘Well done. This is how reporting should be. You did well to
remove the vulgar words.’</p><p><br></p><p>“By slapping me on the back this way,” Anand Swami told me, “Gandhi
won me over.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “This is all backwards. Did you try another experiment to
see if Gandhi didn’t use vulgar words and you added them to his
statement, whether or not he would slap your back even then? That would
be something!</p><p>“It means that Gandhi spoke too eagerly. DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...
It was spoken in eagerness, in excitement, with zeal. It was spoken in
the flow of his speech. Then afterwards he must have regretted it. He
must have thought retrospectively that the vulgar words I spoke, the
swearing I used, should not have happened. They are not appropriate for
a Mahatma. He must have regretted. Then you took out the vulgar words.
You protected Gandhi’s ego, so he slapped your back. In this way your
ego was fed: ‘He slapped my back. I am quite some journalist, a great
journalist.’ Still the statement that was published was false. And if
Gandhi were a lover of truth, he should have said to you to publish the
statement exactly as he had said it. When I have said it why make
changes before publishing? Gandhi was not interested in truth. Gandhi’s
talk about truth has become worthless. He patronized a lie. What was not
said was published, what was said was not published. This is giving
protection to a lie. You protected his ego; he seduced your ego. This is
how you supported each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told Anand Swami, “If there are swear words in my statements they
should be published, because when I have said it, I have said it. And if
later I find out that I didn’t want to say it, then it means that at the
time of speaking I was was not in my senses, I was unconscious.”</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking has its own intoxication. Many times you will say something
that you didn’t want to say. But it is not a question of whether you
wanted to or not. You said it. It was lying there somewhere in your
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>“The statement that you published, Anand Swami,” I said to him, “gave
shelter to a lie. Now for centuries it will be said that Gandhi never
swore. You will be responsible for it. You were to publish just what you
had written down, just what was said – just like it was. If you are to
help Gandhi change then going back and correcting will not be needed. He
should speak with discrimination. He should speak with awareness. Gandhi
spoke thoughtlessly, understanding came only later. He must have
thought, ‘What have I said?’ He must have looked back, he must have felt
the consequences could be bad. It would be good if somehow these words
could be taken back.”</p><p><br></p><p>It happens every day. One day a political leader says something and
the next day he refutes it – “No, that’s not what I said, or that’s not
what I meant, or the meaning has been distorted, or it was just an off
the cuff remarks and he back’s out.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens every day, you see it daily in the papers. It is a
surprising thing. He remembers afterwards because when he is
considering, measuring its effect he finds that it would have been
better if it were never said, saying it can have such and such a result.
He was speaking in such a hurry that there was no chance to weigh what
the consequences might be. It was said hastily in his speech. Later
sitting quietly, he considered and figured out the consequences. What
meanings could be stretched, how many opinions would be influenced to
agree, how many will be influenced against, what will be the consequence
in the political race. The move has been made, what will it mean finally
in the whole game of chess? When he stops and thinks all this the idea
of changing it arises, so he changes it. But this change indicates only
one thing – he spoke thoughtlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, in England a student was taking an oral examination in
a medical college. He had passed all the other subjects, the oral exam
was the last. If he passes this he will receive England’s highest degree
in medicine. Three doctors were examining him. They asked him, “If you
have such and such a patient with such and such a disease and you are to
give these medicines, what amount</p><p>will you give?” He quickly said the amount. All three doctors
laughed. They said, “Okay, you can go. The exam is over.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was just going out the door when it came to him, “That amount
would take his life, it is poison.” He returned and said, “Pardon me, I
would give him half of what I had said.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the doctors said, “The patient has died, who are you coming back
to tell? What’s said is said. This is not merely an exam. If there were
a patient and you gave him this dosage the patient would have died,
who’s pardon are you asking? Come next year, prepare yourself better.
You cannot just come back and correct your statement like this. If we
change it, it would be false, the patient has already died.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t speak thoughtlessly – giving it this meaning does not mean to
speak thoughtfully. In my vision its meaning is no-thought. Where there
is thought there will be error. Where there is no thought, the mind is
completely quiet, like a mirror, silent, empty, where meditation has
awakened – there is never any mistake. There is no need to turn and look
back. There is never any repentance.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I give it the meaning: speaking attentively, what Buddha
called right remembering. Speaking wakefully. Speaking alertly. Not
after thinking: is there an opportunity for thinking, is there time or
not? Where is there time in life? Many times you want to say good things
but can’t say them, later you remember.</p><p><br></p><p>The great Western thinker Victor Hugo was coming out of a sitting
room. Three or four other writers were coming with him, conversing. One
writer expressed something. It was such a lovely statement that from
Victor Hugo’s mouth came out, “If only I had said that!”</p><p><br></p><p>A third writer said, “Hugo, don’t worry. You will say it. Some day or
other you will say it. If not today you’ll say it tomorrow. It will come
out of your mouth, don’t worry. You will say it in other circumstances,
but you will certainly say it. You cannot leave it alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>But what is said is said. You may also have felt many times that you
could have said that. It is as if someone has stolen the words which you
were about to say, stolen the words that had come to your lips. And
sometimes you feel that if only you had held back just one word, how
much trouble you would have avoided. Because sometimes a small word can
change a whole life. A small curse you have given may change your whole
life, and a sweet statement falling from your lips may make your whole
life new, nothing can be said about it... just a small statement.</p><p><br></p><p>The famous American actress Greta Garbo was very poor in her
childhood. And she used to work in a barber shop lathering soap on
people’s beards. She had never thought she would become such a great
actress, a world famous actress. One day a movie director came to the
barber shop to get a haircut and she lathered soap on his face. While
she was lathering – he was a movie director – looking at her face in the
mirror, just one word slipped out of his mouth, “Beautiful... what a
beautiful face.”</p><p><br></p><p>And this small statement became a revolution in Greta Garbo’s life. A
girl getting two cents for lathering beards died the owner of millions
of dollars – just this small statement. It was not said after thinking
it over, it came out spontaneously. But Greta Garbo was reminded of her
beauty. For the</p><p>first time she looked at herself in the mirror with great
deliberation. Daily she had stood in front of the mirror, but she just
went on lathering people’s beards. She had never noticed. She had never
thought that she was beautiful, or that she could be beautiful. The poor
girl didn’t have the capacity even to think of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Greta Garbo asked, “Really, you think I am beautiful?”</p><p><br></p><p>The movie director said, “Not just beautiful, but one of the most
beautiful women. And if you want I will prove it, because I am a movie
director. I am making a movie. I can put you in it. You have a
photogenic face, that will look so beautiful in the picture. I have been
working with pictures my whole life.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is why it often happens that some person, film actor or actress
when you meet them directly doesn’t seem so beautiful: he has a
photogenic face. In a photograph they appear beautiful whether face to
face they look beautiful or not. These are two different things. Many
times people are very beautiful when you meet them face to face, but
don’t look so beautiful in a picture.</p><p><br></p><p>Greta Garbo ascended the skies. A small incident, an accidental word
changed her whole life. Otherwise perhaps she would have died still
lathering soap on people’s beards. A small word can give rise to such
ripples: can make a friend, can make an enemy; can give life beauty, can
make it ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY...</p><p><br></p><p>But the meaning I give it is not speak thoughtfully: in thought is
calculating, cunning, cleverness, politics. I say, speak from
no-thought, from a feeling of peace and silence. Let it arise in silence
from deep within. And then what you say will be integral, because it
arises out of peace. Right speech and you will settle down. Otherwise
the ego takes you from one extreme to the next.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t walk stamping your feet. Don’t make noise in your life. Pass by
so that no one knows. Remain absent. This is god’s way of being. God is
present everywhere, but he is unknown. What is his art? DON’T WALK WITH
A STRUT... Don’t stamp your feet. Don’t go on pointing your finger at
yourself saying look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>God is present as an absence. He is present. He is visible to those
who also become absent, who themselves become completely silent. Only in
their eyes is his face reflected.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...</p><p><br></p><p>People move with such pride. They walk arrogantly, uselessly
arrogant.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you noticed? When you are alone on the street you walk in one
way. If the path is deserted, no one in sight, you’re out for a morning
walk, you move in a certain way. You won’t strut. But then suddenly two
people come on the road, and your step changes. You watch tomorrow, your
step will change. When two people enter the road, your step will change.
Now you move in a different</p><p>way. And if two beautiful women step onto the road then your stride
will change even more. You will quickly dust yourself off and start
proudly twisting your mustache, straighten up your tie, put your hat at
a slant. You will immediately start strutting along. Even without
mustache people proudly twist. It is not necessary to have a mustache to
stand proud. Pride is a separate matter. It can be shown in any manner,
some with a mustache, some with a tie, but show pride.</p><p><br></p><p>People walk as if the whole world is watching them, as if everyone’s
eyes are on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Strutting means, everyone’s eyes should be on me. Why? Because the
ego demands attention from people. And the more attention ego gets from
others the more it is nourished. The more people greet you on the
street, the more people agree that yes, you are something, the more your
ego is strengthened. Go out on the street one day, if no one even looks,
no one even says hello, if the whole village has decided to treat you
this way, to pretend you don’t even exist – you will be very unhappy.
You will come back tired and defeated. You will say, what happened? Your
strutting has had no effect.</p><p><br></p><p>You watch small children, they play this game every day. There is no
great difference in grown ups. From the youngest to the oldest there are
nothing but children. If you want to watch grown up children, go to
Delhi sometime – children of sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five, eighty,
eighty-three. Someone is prime minister [83 year old Morarji Desai].
Someone is home minister, someone is defense minister, and they go on
chasing after each other, like small children. Like children fighting on
a garbage heap playing king of the mountain. And if one stands on top
then the others go on shoving and a great match of pushing and shoving
ensues. Each one twists his mustache in pride. And each one says to
himself, “I will overpower each and every one of them and stay up. Look
how I threw this one down, or look how I put that one flat on his
back.”</p><p><br></p><p>From young age to old, people remain children. As long as you attract
attention, as long as you say look at me, you are a child, you are
childish.</p><p><br></p><p>You experience it in children every day. If there are children at
your house, when a guest comes you tell the children a guest is coming,
just be quiet. Then the children cannot remain silent. They would
otherwise be sitting quietly in the corner playing with their dolls, but
as soon as guests come the children come and get in the way. They start
asking irrelevant questions... I want ice cream, I am hungry. You are
surprised, until now the child was sitting silently, what has happened
to him? The child has become a politician. He is saying. “Will these
guests go without looking at me? I will show them, I will tell them that
I too am someone. This house runs according to me, I will demonstrate
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you tell a child something when you are alone with him he will
accept it. If you say it in front of four people he is not willing to
accept it, he stubbornly refuses. This is why if you take a child who is
well behaved at home to the market he will cause an embarrassment right
in the middle – I want to buy this, I want to buy that. And what is your
embarrassment? The embarrassment is that in front of four persons you
cannot say that I cannot buy it, I don’t have the money, my pocket is
empty, don’t torture me. He is waiting for this opportunity to show
you...</p><p><br></p><p>Small children can easily push your buttons. Then when you are older
you play on these buttons a little more subtly, a little more cleverly.
But there is no difference. You have not grown up. The ego never grows
up, the ego is always childish.</p><p>... DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen children, stamping their feet, making noise, throwing
things on the floor. You have seen women who throw plates in the house
at the smallest provocation, drop pots and pans, fill the whole house
with noise. ... DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT... That woman is saying I will
show you.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin’s wife was running after him – carrying her rolling
pin. Mulla got scared and slid under a bed. The wife was fat and
couldn’t get under the bed. Mulla sat proudly under the bed. Then
somebody knocked on the door, some guest came. The wife quickly hid her
rolling pin and said to Mulla, “Come out from there, a guest has come,
come out quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “Let the guests come, today I will show you who runs this
house. I will sit wherever I want.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “Not so loud!”</p><p><br></p><p>But Mulla said, “Am I afraid of anyone? Who is master of this house?
Today it will be decided – you or me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “Shhh!!! Quiet. Come out from there.”</p><p><br></p><p>But by this time Mulla’s pride had mounted. He said, “Ask
forgiveness, ask ‘please’.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had to ask please. The guest is at the door and Mulla is sitting
under the bed, will it look good? And if he begins to say something
sitting under the bed, he starts to speak... she had to say please.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT...</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh is saying, speak meditatively, walk silently. Walk as if you
are not. Walk so no one knows it. Don’t walk like a street band playing.
Don’t beat your drum.</p><p><br></p><p>... PLACE YOUR FEET WITH CARE</p><p><br></p><p>Place your steps so slowly that there is no sound. Come and pass
through this world like a gust of wind comes and passes through. No one
will get even a whisper of when you came, when you left. Pass through
like a silent, empty sound. And you will know god. And you will
recognize god.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are eager to show the world become actors. Out on the
street you will find mostly actors. Before leaving their homes, people
spend so much time getting ready. Women spend hours standing in front of
the mirror. Even the mirror gets tired! The husband is sitting out on
the street honking the horn and the wife is still in front of the mirror
thinking shall I wear this sari or that sari?</p><p><br></p><p>I was a guest at someone’s house. The husband was taking me to a
meeting, he was honking the horn, it was already late. And the wife
angrily looked out the window and said, “I have told you a thousand
times I am coming in a minute.” If she is going to say it a thousand
times, then it will take hours just to say it ... “But this constant
horn honking is killing me. Can I put on a sari or not?”</p><p>In the evening when we came back, I asked her, “At any rate you were
going to have to put on a sari. Why did it take so long?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “How could it not take long? Come, I will show you – I have
three hundred saris. One has to think it over, consider, which one to
wear, this one or that. This has some good qualities, that has other
qualities. So it is a problem. Sometimes I put on one then have to
change it. So it takes a long time.”</p><p><br></p><p>People are actors. This is why other peoples’ wives seem more
beautiful than our own wives, because we see our own wives in their
natural condition but you see others’ wives on stage – in full costume,
all made up...</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin says that for birth control no other method is
needed, just wives shouldn’t use make-up. It is sufficient. Nothing else
is required. This is enough to make the mind disinterested. Remaining
spontaneous and natural, enough...</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET
WITH CARE.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t take the world as a stage and don’t get lost in acting here.
There is truth also inside – beyond acting. You will know that truth,
you will be able to turn towards it, when in your mind you are no longer
concerned that others give you attention, whether others pay attention
to you or not. When you want others to pay attention to you, you have to
pay attention to them. It is a mutual give and take. When will you give
attention to yourself? You will have to pay attention to others if you
want them to pay attention to you. If you want people to ask how much
you paid for the sari you are wearing you will first have to ask about
their sari: How much? What a beautiful weave? Where did you buy it? Then
the other will ask you. Naturally, it is a world of give and take. If
you give attention to others, others give attention to you in response,
because they also want to receive attention, the same as you. We go on
decorating each others egos – when will you give attention to yourself?
You will miss knowing that which is waiting within you – and that is the
highest wealth, it is the highest bliss. God is hidden in that
consciousness. If you taste that consciousness, you will taste eternal
life.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET
WITH CARE.</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhere else Gorakh has said:</p><p><br></p><p>THE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES WHEN
THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS FRUITFULLY. THE FULL
POT CARRIED SILENTLY...</p><p>A pot filled with water is still, it does not splash.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES</p><p><br></p><p>One which is half full splashes. A filled water pot doesn’t make
noise, a half filled pot makes noise. The more noise you make and stamp
your feet, the clearer is the message that you are false. The</p><p>more you walk like a street band playing, walk raising your flag...
‘let our flag remain on high’ ... the more you show that you are false,
you are half... THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES. One who knows, who has
had a little experience of life becomes reserved, becomes deep. There is
no sound, there is silence around him, a quiet music...</p><p><br></p><p>THE FULL POT CARRIED SILENTLY, THE HALF FULL SOUNDING SPLASHES WHEN
THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS FRUITFULLY.</p><p>You make meaningless noise. What else is your speech? There is
nothing in your speech because you don’t know anything, what do you have
worth saying? But people talk so much, so much nonsense is said. Other
people are dumping rubbish in your ears, you are dumping rubbish into
others’ ears, rubbish heaped upon rubbish. Pay close attention, ninety
percent of what you say the whole day is completely worthless, if it
weren’t said it would be okay<span class=s4></span>THE HALF
SOUNDING</p><p>SPLASHES if one which is half filled does not splash what will it do?
It creates much noise. People go on talking. The whole world is full of
talk: unneeded, meaningless talk.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says: WHEN THE SEEKER IS READY<span class=s4></span>One who
knows will speak only to those whose</p><p>eagerness to know is clear. A master speaks only to one who is a
potential master. He doesn’t speak to each and everyone. It is no use
speaking to everyone. A master sits only with those who show a glimpse
of being a potential master. A true master speaks to true disciples. He
doesn’t speak to each and everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I am asked why aren’t arrangements made for everyone to come and
listen here? There is no need for everyone to come here. I speak to
those who have potential. I speak to those who are eager, who are
thirsty.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE SEEKER IS READY, O AVADHUT, THE MASTER SPEAKS
FRUITFULLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is some gain in speaking. One who has become enlightened
speaks to those who will become enlightened, then there is some gain,
otherwise it is just meaningless nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be an egoist, live naturally, such a small teaching but this is
the greatest teaching. Gorakh says, only this much I say to you, if you
can understand this, if you can accomplish this then everything will
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>... DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Live spontaneously – what does it mean to live spontaneously? Don’t
live through calculations, live out of innocence. Trees are spontaneous,
birds and animals are spontaneous, only man is not spontaneous. Where
does this unnaturalness come from? I display to people what I am not. I
will prove I am what I am not – this is where unnaturalness arises. I am
poor but I will make an impression on people of being wealthy. I am
ignorant but I will give people the idea that I know. I am nobody but I
have a great desire to speak, to be somebody – that ego may someday be
fulfilled. So you go on telling people you are what you are not. Inside
one thing, outside another. With this deceit you have become
unnatural.</p><p>You can be spontaneous when you drop this trip of the ego. When you
say I am like I am – bad then bad, good then good. I am just as god made
me. I will not needlessly put on a veil and hide myself. Now your
situation is like a wound that you have put a rose flower over and
hidden. So you have become unnatural. The wound is within, a rose flower
is placed over it. Pus is forming inside. And because of the rose flower
the wound cannot heal, it doesn’t receive the sun light, does not get
fresh air.</p><p><br></p><p>Expose yourself exactly as you are within. Then you will be
spontaneous. Drop your fear. What’s the fear? That people think badly of
you? What is the harm? If people won’t pay attention to you, will not
respect you, what is lost? What do you get from their respect?</p><p><br></p><p>NATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY, DON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.</p><p><br></p><p>Take care of your being. NATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY... Gorakh Nath
says, take care or your soul. Don’t get into useless arguments, I am
this, I am that.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.</p><p><br></p><p>What you are you are. God made you this way. Look after this
consciousness. NATH SAYS, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY, DON’T INSIST ON DEBATE.</p><p>THIS WORLD IS A GARDEN OF THORNS, PLACE EACH STEP ALERTLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Here there are great gardens of thorns. Very attractive gardens. From
afar they seem flowers. When they prick, you will know they are thorns.
From afar they give the illusion of sweet music, but when you come
close, when you are trapped, there is trouble. Fish too are caught,
seeing the bait. The hook inside the bait is not visible to them either.
Others praise you, they are setting bait. There is a thorn in this bait,
and now you are caught.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why flattery has so much power in the world. If you tell the
dumbest jackass how intelligent he is, how learned he is, the donkey
believes it. The donkey doesn’t question: me, learned and intelligent?
He believes it because he wants to. You have said what he was thinking.
There is a saying that at the right moment you will call a donkey your
father. And the donkey will believe it. And he knows within that he is a
donkey and he cannot possibly be your father. But the believing mind
says believe it, why are you passing up a chance like this? If you tell
a crow he is a sweet singing cuckoo the crow will not deny it. If you
flatter him too much and he gets excited then he will caw, caw and prove
he is a crow. But he will think that he is sweetly calling out:
‘kuhuu-kuhuu’.</p><p>This is why flattery has so much influence. If you flatter someone he
will be ready to do anything, any job can be done. You also are taken in
by flattery, move alertly.</p><p><br></p><p>PLACE EACH STEP ALERTLY...</p><p><br></p><p>THIS WORLD IS A GARDEN OF THORNS...</p><p><br></p><p>There are many thorns here. Flowers cover up, thorns are inside. You
go to grasp a flower and are pricked by a thorn, then it is difficult to
get free. This is how people fall into greed, anger, ego – and they
become unspontaneous.</p><p>GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>And pride is a wide road. Don’t think that it is only emperors that
are filled with ego, a beggar too has ego. Beggars also have egos.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard there was a beggar who came daily to Mulla Nasruddin’s
lane, for many days he didn’t appear. When he saw him in the market
Mulla asked, “You are not seen these days, you used to come daily to
harass me. You have harassed for such a long time, for so many years
that it has become a habit. Many times I have thought you haven’t come,
what has happened? You didn’t come to the door and rap your staff.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I gave the lane to my son-in-law.” Mulla said,
“Meaning?”</p><p>He said, “That lane was mine. There no other beggar can cause any
mischief or I will break his limbs.” He was a cripple, dragging himself
along, saying, “I would break their limbs, no beggar can cause mischief
there. That lane was mine. I gave it as a dowry – my daughter got
married!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla had thought the lane was his, today he found out who the lane
belongs to. Don’t think that only emperors have egos, beggars too have
egos. They too have their kingdom, they too have their boundaries. If
you enter into their territory, you will be in difficulty. If you beg
there you will have to pay taxes to them. If a new beggar begs in the
lane of an old beggar he will have to pay taxes.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, you might never have thought about it, you never knew
which beggar you belong to. There is a beggar on the street who has
bought you. He has rights. He has a license to beg from you. If any
other beggar begs then he will have to pay taxes. You didn’t know that
you have been sold, that the beggar on the street is your master and has
rights over you.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think that only the rich have egos. Don’t think that only the
worldly have egos. Yogis have big egos, renunciates have even bigger
egos – they have renounced so much! DON’T BE PROUD... Scholars have big
egos.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh has said:</p><p><br></p><p>MOVING WITHOUT PATH, BURNING WITHOUT FIRE,</p><p><br></p><p>WELL KNOWING GORAKH SAYS, FIGURE THIS OUT O LEARNED PUNDITS.</p><p><br></p><p>He says, listen you reciting pandits, you parroting pandits. What do
you have? But you move arrogantly. Some rubbish, some borrowed stinking
words!</p><p><br></p><p>WELL KNOWING GORAKH SAYS...</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, I have known from experiencing myself and then I found
out that you have only words and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>... FIGURE THIS OUT O LEARNED PUNDITS.</p><p>O well-read pundits, O so-called pundits! Figure out what I am
saying, come to your senses. MOVING WITHOUT PATH... There is a movement
that is without path, where there is no path and the goal arrives. Do
you know anything about it? By reading and reciting you have become a
pandit, do you know the path that doesn’t exist but the goal comes?</p><p><br></p><p>MOVING WITHOUT PATH, BURNING WITHOUT FIRE...</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know the happening that occurs from a fireless burning? I know
a fire like this, that doesn’t exist yet it burns. I know a death, that
doesn’t occur, but it happens. I know a goal that has no path to reach
it. I know that which is sitting within you. What can be the path to
reach there? A path is to take you far away. If god was distant there
could be a path. God is you, so what path? You are god himself.</p><p><br></p><p>MOVING WITHOUT PATH...</p><p><br></p><p>This is why if you stop you will reach.</p><p><br></p><p>... BURNING WITHOUT FIRE...</p><p><br></p><p>And this ego is false. To burn it no real fire is needed. If you
understand this then the fire of understanding is enough, and it
burns.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, my teaching is very direct – of spontaneity. As Kabir
has said, based on Gorakh: “O Seeker, the natural samadhi is best.”</p><p><br></p><p>SWAMI, GOING TO THE FOREST HUNGER ARISES, GOING TO THE CITY MAYA
ARISES.</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, O swamis, O escapist sannyasins! If you go to the
jungle hunger will catch you. Then sitting in the jungle twenty-four
hours a day you will think of food. Who knows if anyone will give it.
Will anyone bring it or not? And if you go to the town you will be
caught in maya, caught in illusion, caught in attachment, caught in
desire. You will see a beautiful woman passing by and you will be
fascinated. You will see a beautiful house and desire will arise – if
only it were mine! If you stay in the city maya will catch you. If you
go to the jungle to be saved from maya, hunger catches you. What will
you do? You are in great difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>STUFFING YOURSELF, SEXUAL DESIRE ARISES...</p><p><br></p><p>If you over eat, really stuff yourself, sex desire will be created
from this stuffing, from the extra food. If you eat more than is
necessary, it creates desire inside of you. Why does it create desire?
Because you will not be able to contain the extra energy you have taken
into yourself, it wants to go out, it is superfluous, it is not needed,
it is burdensome.</p><p><br></p><p>What is desire? A way for energy to go out. What is sex? A way to
throw out energy. When you have too much energy that you cannot contain,
it will begin to flow out on its own. It has to flow out. A container
can be filled with only as much water as it contains. If it is filled
more, it will overflow. Desire is the energy that overflows your vessel,
this is why if you eat too much you will be caught in sex desire. Now it
is very difficult. If you eat too little you will remember all kinds of
food day and night.</p><p>So what will you do? What is the way? Be spontaneous Gorakh says.
Come to the middle. Eat as much as is necessary. Don’t go to the jungle,
because there you will be hungry. Don’t play around so much in the city
that besides city nothing remains of you, because desire will catch you
there. But how to live? Live in the city like someone living in the
jungle, this is the middle. Live at home like one lives in the forest.
Live in the world but don’t let the world inside of you. Live as a lotus
leaf in the water.</p><p><br></p><p>... WHY WASTE THIS BODY BORN OF PASSION?</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will know how this body created from egg and sperm attains
the state of enlightenment! Then you will know. If you have chosen to go
to the jungle because you are afraid desire will catch you in the city,
then hunger will catch you. If you are afraid hunger will catch you in
the jungle, come to the city... and wherever you go, it will be city or
jungle, there is no other possibility. If out of duality you choose one,
then you will not be able to remain with it very long, because the needs
of the opposite will begin to pull you, will begin to attract you.</p><p><br></p><p>So eat the right amount of food – what is sufficient for meditation,
sufficient for worship and prayer. Eat rightly, give to the body what is
needed for natural functions. Don’t dump more, otherwise the extra
amount will put you in trouble. Don’t go to extremes.</p><p><br></p><p>There are some people who overeat, stuffing and forcing food. Their
whole work is food, food, food... they don’t do anything else. Then
superfluous energy arises from the extra food. Then the release of
energy is necessary, otherwise the energy will be a burden, will become
a load. Then go into desire. Then the energy flows out in desire. Then
people are so drowned in desire that whatever energy they had flows out
in it. Then they become empty, emptied out. Then they fill up with food
because now they are empty, now emptiness aggravates. This becomes a
great disturbance. From one extreme to the other extreme, from the other
back to the first, from the first back to the second, going on swinging
like this, like the pendulum of a clock. The clock of life goes on. Your
coming and going continues. Stop in the middle. Have you ever stopped
the pendulum of a clock and seen what happens? As soon as the pendulum
stops the clock stops. Coming and going has stopped. Time has stopped.
Time has stopped means the world has stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T ATTACK YOUR FOOD, DON’T DIE OF HUNGER, CONTEMPLATE THE SECRET

This whole universe is filled with mystery, it is overflowing with the
beauty of the highest. The blessings of that highest are present
everywhere. In these rays of sunlight, in the specks of sunlight falling
on the leaves, in green leaves, in flowers, in birds, in people, this
vast life, drink his mystery, fill yourself with it.</p><p><br></p><p>O my heart, speak of Him! In comparison to his face, All colors and
shapes pale;</p><p>I have become sated with him – Drinking his water of compassion;</p><p>Float on him wave after wave, flow with him! O my heart, speak of
Him!</p><p>His fluid nimble way of moving, Is unique in the whole world; His

Him!</p><p>The bliss of his spontaneous closeness, Is a trust of life;</p><p>But if the hour comes –</p><p><br></p><p>of parting company with the beloved;</p><p>Then deep within will I bear the fire of distance from him! O my
heart, speak of Him!</p><p>Remember the divine. Don’t become a glutton, and against gluttony
don’t always be starving and fasting. Remember again the story of Shrona
– when the strings of the veena of life are neither too tight nor too
loose music arises. This music is a song of devotion. This music is
kirtan. This music is remembrance.</p><p><br></p><p>O my heart, speak of Him!</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the divine. Assimilate his secret. And his secret is
overflowing, it is whispered in every direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Your laughing call, O bird of songs! Spread freedom’s wings</p><p>Sound the conch of life,</p><p><br></p><p>And you join with eager speed This painted sky!</p><p>Soar beyond the horizon Send a piercing ray</p><p>Open the heavenly gates of your heart And you rain a shower of
nectar</p><p>This pattering melody!</p><p><br></p><p>Secret sky of subtle intelligence Drink the soma nectar of eternity,
And you sing your drunken bliss, This immortal, alone!</p><p>Watch the moon, watch the sun, Let the trumpet of truth proclaim,</p><p>And distinctions of this world are kidnapped O destroyer of

the cave of the navel</p><p>O supine serpent!</p><p><br></p><p>It is he outside, it is he inside. Just sink a little into his
mystery. It is he seen rising in the trees, he appears showering light
in the moon and stars. He is moving in your every breath, he is hidden
in every beat of your heart. It is he who pervades your consciousness –
drink up his mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>The more a person is filled with the beauty of the universe the
closer he reaches to god. All this beauty is his.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T OVERWORK, DON’T LIE AROUND, THUS SAYS GORAKH DEVA</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be stubborn. Don’t try to force the body more than
necessary. DON’T OVERWORK...</p><p>Don’t make too much effort otherwise you will become tired and
broken. But also don’t do the reverse: ... DON’T LIE AROUND...</p><p>Don’t become lazy. Don’t just lie there thinking: “We shouldn’t make
effort, shouldn’t exert ourselves So I’ll just lie around.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what is to be done? Between the two... Act, as if inactive. Do,
but don’t become the doer. Let him be the doer, you are merely his
vessel, only a medium... as Krishna said to Arjuna in the Geeta, just
become a medium. The doer is god, become a bow string in his hands. If
he shoots arrows with you then arrows, and if he offers worship in the
temple with you, then worship.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be over active... like people who believe in the yoga of good
acts, they become over active. And don’t be too inactive. There is a
yoga of inaction too. This too has become a belief. Such people also
find support from the scriptures, from the songs of the sant mystics.
They extract their own meanings. For instance Baba Maluk has said:</p><p><br></p><p>Boas never hold a job, birds have never worked; Das Maluka says, no
need, Rama provides for all.</p><p>Lazy people have extracted their meaning from this. They have made a
very beautiful interpretation. They say, it is good, then we will lie
around happily as big snakes lie around. So some sadhus and sants just
lie around. They think, what is there to to? Baba Maluk has said that
“existence provides for all.” If it provides it provides... relax and
believe in fate.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole country has died believing in fate. Laziness has spread
through this whole country. This whole country has become indolent and
idle. And it has given it’s indolence and idleness a very</p><p>spiritual color by saying it is fate, what happens is what is meant
to happen. If one is poor one is poor. A beggar then a beggar, a slave
then a slave. Everything happens by fate. When he wishes it then
everything will be made well, but we have to drag along.</p><p><br></p><p>The suffering of this country is that we have taken up this sutra –
of laziness. We are lying down. The misery of the West is that they have
taken up action, taken it up so much that they can’t sleep at night –
they have forgotten how. Now they cannot sleep without sleeping pills.
They have become so active, so many waves have arisen, the mind is
moving so much that they lay down on the bed at night but the mind has
forgotten sleep even exists. It goes right on thinking. It makes
calculations, does accounting, makes plans: tomorrow’s shop, tomorrow’s
market, tomorrow’s world. It remains absorbed in its plans. This way the
night is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>The West is going crazy because of too much activity. And the East
has become poor because of too much inactivity. If what Gorakh says is
understood then there is no need to go crazy and no need to be poor.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T OVERWORK, DON’T LIE AROUND, THUS SAYS GORAKH DEVA.</p><p><br></p><p>I tell you to be in between. Work but from a state of no work. Enter
into work, but peacefully, silently... so that work does not make you
restless. Work but don’t go insane in it.</p><p><br></p><p>OVER EATING STRENGTHENS THE SENSES, DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE
MIND WITH SEX.</p><p><br></p><p>If you eat too much food the senses will be strengthened and
awareness will be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>... DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE MIND WITH SEX.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more awareness is destroyed the more nothing but sex remains
in the mind. Understand this. The more the amount of awareness increases
the more the amount of sex decreases. The more the amount of awareness
decreases the more the amount of sex increases. These two are always
influencing each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Make an experiment and see. If you eat too much then unconsciousness
overtakes you, immediately sleep starts coming. This is why sleep starts
coming after eating. Remain some night without eating, then sleep will
not come the whole night. You didn’t eat so unconsciousness does not
overtake you. This is why to one who fasts sleep doesn’t come at night.
Or sleep becomes less. In old age sleep becomes less because food
becomes less. The body cannot digest so much food. Life is finishing so
now there is no need for sleep either. Unconsciousness takes over in
sleep. For sleep it is necessary that your body remain more powerful
than your being, only then can sleep take over. When you eat the body
grows, the being becomes weak. If you eat too much then the body becomes
very burdensome, you start getting drowsy.</p><p><br></p><p>When consciousness increases, you will find simultaneously that sex
desire has started becoming less, because the pressure of the body
becomes less on the being. This is why Gorakh and I do not</p><p>tell you to fight against sex desire, we tell you to awaken
awareness. Become more alert. Whatever you do, do it with alertness. If
you go into sex, go into it alertly, go into it consciously. And you
will be surprised, as consciousness increases, sex desire will become
weak by itself. One day you will suddenly find that without repressing,
without fighting that you don’t know where sex stopped – when you go
within to look for it, you don’t find it. Everything within has become
lit with awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex and meditation have the same relationship as light and darkness.
If a lamp is lit, darkness is ended. There is no need to throw out
darkness. Who can throw it out? How can it be thrown? Can anyone throw
it out? Only a lamp is to be lit. This is why the people who fight with
sex desire have gotten into very foolish activity. Fight with desire and
it will increase. You will be more possessed by it. No one has ever
fought darkness and won. Cutting it with a sword doesn’t work. Beating
it with a staff makes no sense. Give it a shove, collect all the strong
men of the village, still you won’t be able to push the darkness out of
a small hut. But light one small lamp and you won’t even know where the
darkness has gone. Darkness is not a thing, darkness is negative.
Darkness is only an absence, the absence of light. If light becomes
present, it is done. There was no darkness, nor has it gone anywhere:
only light was missing, light has come.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is the absence of meditation. If the lamp of meditation is lit:
enough, sex is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Here people ask me, “You don’t teach people brahmacharya – to be
celibate? Brahmacharya cannot be taught. Only meditation can be taught.
Brahmacharya is the result. As meditation ripens, brahmacharya comes to
fruit by itself. All effort is to be put into meditation. One who puts
his effort directly into brahmacharya will sit suppressing sex in the
name of brahmacharya. And brahmacharya is not happening – it is only
superficial – within the being the worms of desire are crawling. Inside
the snake of desire will raise its hood. His life will become very
unnatural. His life will become very difficult. Peace will not arise in
his life, nor will equanimity come. He will fall deep into duality. A
continuous struggle will go on turning within him. And how can there be
experience of god while struggling? A non-dual mind is needed, only then
is the experience of god possible.</p><p><br></p><p>OVER EATING STRENGTHENS THE SENSES, DESTROYS CONSCIOUSNESS, FILLS THE
MIND WITH SEX.</p><p><br></p><p>SLEEP OVERTAKES, DEATH CLOSES IN...</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep catches you, death catches you.</p><p><br></p><p>... THE HEART ENTANGLED.</p><p><br></p><p>And then trouble always created within, a disturbance continues to be
raised. An insanity goes on increasing. Just look inside yourself and
see how mad you are. Madness goes on there. Living in this madness how
will you know the truth? It is impossible! This madness must go. And
there is only one way for this madness to go – LAUGHING, PLAYING THE
KNACK OF MEDITATION. Laugh, play, dance, be ecstatic and keep
meditating. This is enough, it will go.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MILK DIETER MONK’S MIND ON OTHERS’ COWS...</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few people who have decided to consume milk only. They
think milk is the purest food.</p><p>I was a guest for some time in Raipur. There is a community there –
of the milk drinkers sect. Milk is the only diet of the people living
there. They thought they would be healthier with milk. Have you gone
mad? In the first place, the milk you are drinking has not been produced
for you. You drink cow’s milk, no? It is produced for calves. It is for
growing bulls. Milk is not a pure food. From milk, sex desire will
awaken. And sex desire like that of a bull – not just a little, because
god made it for a bull not for you.</p><p><br></p><p>And the nature of milk is to be a provision for the child, so the
child can get milk until he can digest food. After a certain age no
animal drinks milk, with the exception of man. Man makes unnatural
arrangements. To drink a little in tea, a little in coffee is okay, but
don’t become a milk dieter.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was in Raipur a priest from the milk diet community came to
meet me. He asked, “How to become victorious over sexual desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “First drop this milk diet, drop this practice. To be a man
is bad enough, you will become a bull! ... and you take nothing but
milk. People go on bringing milk because the saints drink nothing but
milk... pure food. What is pure about milk?</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago there was a report in the newspapers that meat
has been produced from milk in Japan. Milk is a part of the blood, this
is why meat can be made from it. Scientists have succeeded in creating
meat from milk. Within two or three months white meat produced from milk
will be available in Japanese markets. Milk contains the same substance
that is in meat. This is why flesh increases from drinking milk, blood
improves, a person becomes robust.</p><p><br></p><p>Where do you think the milk comes from when a child is born from the
mother’s womb? As blood passes through her breasts it begins to produce
milk. In this way blood is available to the child. And the child cannot
digest anything else. It is good for him at this age. There is not such
purity in milk as you think there is. There is greater purity in fruits,
greater purity in wheat, rice, beans.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, THE MILK DRINKER MONK’S MIND ON OTHERS’ COWS...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t become a milk dieter. Otherwise the milk drinker has always to
pay attention which house he will get milk from, which house he will not
get it from. ... MIND ON OTHER’S COWS... His attention is continuously
on others’ houses. Whose cow is good, whose cow is bad...</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was travelling with a sadhu. He would drink only the milk of a
white cow. I said, “You have gone mad. Use a little common sense. Milk
from a black cow doesn’t turn black, milk is always white. Are you
afraid of a black cow because the milk might become black?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” he said, “No, I am... my guru suggested milk of a white
cow.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whether the skin of the cow is white or black what difference is
there in the milk? Then the milk of black women would be black, and the
milk of white women would be white. Milk is white, but nothing becomes
pure just by being white.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen herons? Herons of Indian politics fishing in pure white
homespun khadi? Mulla Nasruddin went into the market one day wearing
khadi shirt and vest, wearing khadi hat and fine cut pajamas. And
someone said, “Mulla, what a clean white!”</p><p>Mulla said, “Don’t be deceived, no matter how white the clothes are,
the heart is mine, still black as ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>The heart does not become white from clothes being white, nor does
anyone’s soul become pure from drinking white milk.</p><p><br></p><p>But people create problems. That sadhu travelling with me was in
great difficulty. First he had to circle all around the cow and check
that there was no black spot or anything on the cow. If the cow was
completely white, then before milking it someone had to bathe. They
should milk it wearing wet clothing so they remained in a freshly bathed
condition. His followers had to milk wearing wet clothes. They were
shivering. It was winter, they went on shivering and milking... And he
consumed only milk and thought he was doing something very virtuous.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You will fall into hell. They will all make complaints
against you, these people freezing in the cold. Someone will get
pneumonia, someone will catch a cold – it is all being done for you. You
will suffer the fruit of bad karma. Now you are shocked, but it is
better you are careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MILK DIETER MONK’S MIND ON OTHER’S COWS, THE NAKED ALWAYS NEED
FIREWOOD.</p><p><br></p><p>And those who have gone naked need wood to burn everyday. Is a
blanket worse than this? Are clothes worse than this? You live naked so
you burn wood. This is greater violence, because to burn wood you have
to cut trees. And his mind is continually concerned with getting
firewood each day. He needs his holy fire burning twenty-four hours a
day because he lives naked. The fire goes on burning. And how many
insects are dying in the fire? Trees are cut, insects die in the
fire..what was wrong with wearing clothes? Why are you creating
troubles?</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says let life be spontaneous. These are unnatural things. Now
their minds are caught up in meaningless things: Will I get firewood
today or not? Will I find a white cow or not? Will I get milk or not?
Will I get enough milk or not? Make life simple, not complex. Be
natural, be ordinary. Don’t buy into things that give your mind useless
worries.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK IN SILENCE DESIRES A COMPANION...</p><p><br></p><p>And the one who vows silence, he wants someone to move with him, he
always needs a companion.</p><p><br></p><p>A friend came to meet me, a silent Muni Maharaj. He brought someone
with him to interpret his signs and tell me. I said, “Why don’t you
speak directly?”</p><p><br></p><p>His companion said, “No, he has taken a vow of silence, he doesn’t
speak directly.” I said, “This is an additional problem. Now you have to
go wherever he goes.”</p><p>He said, “Yes, I have to go. And Muni Maharaj never touches money
either, I have to keep the money. If we take a rickshaw or taxi I have
to give the money. He doesn’t touch money.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But whose money is it?” I asked.</p><p>“The money is his. People give it to him, but I hold it. People offer
it at his feet, I quickly collect it.” I said, “Does Muni Maharaj keep
track of it?”</p><p>He said, “How can I hide anything from you? He goes on watching, goes
on counting how many notes have come. With hand signs he says a five
keep it carefully.” Why this useless nonsense? When you are going to
count it anyway, count it yourself and keep it in your own pocket? You
have to count it and keep it in someone else’s pocket and then keep
worrying whether he will run away, whether he will change his mind by
the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “Come tomorrow to the meditation.” It was in Bombay.
Meditations were being held at Birla Matushri’s. So I said, “Come
tomorrow morning for the meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said – he made gestures and had his friend say, “He cannot come,
because I will not be available in the morning, I am going somewhere
else. He cannot come without me. Who will take care of the taxi? Who
will seat him? Who will help him out? He doesn’t speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have become lame by your own hand. God has given you feet, has
given you a tongue. But you have refused them! And you are using a
tongue, it too is god’s tongue, in the other man’s mouth. Your tongue is
also god’s. What sense is there in renouncing a closer tongue to use one
further away? But people are caught up in such disturbances, in such
entanglements.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK IN SILENCE DESIRES A COMPANION...</p><p><br></p><p>He always needs a companion.</p><p><br></p><p>... NO DEPTH WITHOUT THE MASTER’S SHELTER.</p><p><br></p><p>This is all useless nonsense because without finding a master these
people will not find the real thread of life. They have gotten into this
nonsense from reading books, reading scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Place your hopes in one who has found,</p><p><br></p><p>How can thirst be slaked from an empty river? Rahim’s expression is
beautiful!</p><p>... in one who has found,</p><p><br></p><p>You can get something only from someone who has it. How can thirst be
slaked from an empty river?</p><p>Is there water in the scriptures? There are nothing but words.
Thoughts about water, descriptions of water, but where is the water?
Only with a master can you get the secret formula, the sutra, the
key.</p><p><br></p><p>A couplet of Gorakh,</p><p>HIS FRAGRANCE AND SWEETNESS PERVADE THE WHOLE WORLD. THE TRUTH IS,
ONLY A MASTER WHO HAS SEEN, CAN HELP YOU SEE.</p><p>Gorakh says god is the fragrance filling the entire universe. From
his fragrance the whole universe is made fragrant.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS FRAGRANCE AND SWEETNESS PERVADE THE WHOLE WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>And his sweetness is in this whole world, but unless you meet someone
to show you, how will you taste it? Unless you meet someone to tell you,
how will his fragrance reach our nostrils? How will his music connect
with our ears?</p><p><br></p><p>THE TRUTH IS, ONLY A MASTER WHO HAS SEEN, CAN HELP YOU SEE.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is that until you meet a seer, one who has seen, you cannot
be connected to god.</p><p><br></p><p>... NO DEPTH WITHOUT THE MASTER’S SHELTER.</p><p><br></p><p>Without a master faith will not come, trust will not come. Only a
seer can provoke this self trust that yes, god is. Only a seer can be a
witness – an eye witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Without finding a master nothing can be attained. People have fallen
into these useless troubles. And the master’s message is small, a small
sutra: be spontaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET
WITH CARE. GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p>A small sutra, drop the ego, live simply. Don’t be extreme, come to
the middle, a natural state...</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN VIRTUOUS ONE, LISTEN INTELLIGENT ONE, TO THIS CALL OF
NUMBERLESS SIDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DISCIPLE BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT IS
OVER.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh said, if you can listen, listen; if you can understand,
understand. LISTEN VIRTUOUS ONE...</p><p>If you have a little capacity, you have a little intelligence,
listen.</p><p><br></p><p>... LISTEN INTELLIGENT ONE...</p><p><br></p><p>If you have a little awareness, then grasp this.</p><p><br></p><p>... THIS CALL OF NUMBERLESS SIDDHAS.</p><p>And not only I am saying it, numberless enlightened people have said
it.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DISCIPLE BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT IS
OVER.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough, if the disciple bows down, he meets the master. As soon as
the disciple bows he meets the master. The master is always present, if
you bow you meet the master.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an ancient Egyptian saying that whenever the disciple is
ready the master appears. There is not a moment’s waiting. The disciple
bows, the master comes.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE DISCIPLE’S BOWING, THE MASTER IS FOUND, AND THE WORLDLY NIGHT
IS OVER.</p><p><br></p><p>Then this world of night is no more night, then it passes in
wakefulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand these small sutras, comprehend them and practice them a
little in your life, taste them. I finish today’s talk with a couplet of
Rahim,</p><p><br></p><p>RAHIM A STONE IN WATER, SUBMERGED BUT NEVER SOAKED</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE FOOLISH PEOPLE, WHO UNDERSTAND BUT DON’T SEEK LIVING
INSIGHTS.</p><p><br></p><p>Like a stone lying in the river, but still doesn’t get soaked. The
same way foolish people sit in satsang but don’t get soaked.</p><p><br></p><p>RAHIM A STONE IN WATER, SUBMERGED BUT NEVER SOAKED</p><p><br></p><p>It remains submerged, remains under water but doesn’t get soaked,
just remains untouched. Lying in the water it remains untouchable.</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE FOOLISH PEOPLE, WHO UNDERSTAND BUT DON’T SEEK LIVING
INSIGHTS.</p><p><br></p><p>One who sits in satsang listening, listening to the words but doesn’t
experience. ‘... understand without living insight.’ He listens, he
understands but doesn’t live it, doesn’t experience it. Know he is a
fool, he is a stone.</p><p><br></p><p>This is satsang. Get soaked, drown, live it...!</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T SPEAK TOO EAGERLY, DON’T WALK WITH A STRUT, PLACE YOUR FEET
WITH CARE. GORAKH RAJA SAYS, DON’T BE STIFF, LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY.</p><p>Enough for today?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

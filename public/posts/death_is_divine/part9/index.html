I have never seen a drop that won’t become the ocean.\nThere is no drop in existence that won’t become the ocean one day or another. The part becomes the whole. The fragment becomes the unfragmented. The finite becomes the infinite. There is not a single drop whose destiny is not to become the ocean. Then how can there be a single man that will remain deprived of becoming god?\nBecoming god is man’s nature. Just as a drop can become the ocean, if man becomes free of limitations he can become god. Man is god, it is only a matter of letting limitations drop. There is no other barrier to man’s becoming god. We have drawn a Lakshman line, a magic circle, all around us. It is a line drawn by us. We never go out of that circle. We have made a wall. We have made a security arrangement. We have become imprisoned in the known. The unknown is calling, but because of fear we haven’t been able to start off on the journey.\nThe journey of yoga, of union, is an unknown journey. But only one who has become tired of the known will go on an unknown journey. Has what you have known fulfilled your heart?\nIf the heart is fulfilled then no going towards god arises. You have attained god. The very meaning of fulfilling the heart is union with god. Your heart is not fulfilled. Your heart is not fulfilled at all. It remains as empty as ever. Only hopes – tomorrow it will be fulfilled, day after tomorrow it will be fulfilled – go on entangling you. Only false promises that will never be fulfilled. No ones promises have ever been fulfilled.\nYesterday I was listening to a popular song\nWho knows what kind of people they were whose love found love\nThere have never been people whose love has found love. In this world none have ever attained satisfaction.\nWho knows what kind of people they were, whose love found love When I asked for budding flowers, I got a garland of thorns\nWhen I sought the goal of happiness, I received the dust of misery When I wanted songs of affection, I received cold sighs\nThis consolation I received - the heart’s oppression doubled Each friend gave a moment or two of friendship and parted Who has time to hold the hand of the mad?\nOften I am troubled even by my own shadow\nIf this is called living, I will live just like this\nI won’t cry out, but sew my lips together, and drink back my tears How can misery upset me now? Misery I’ve had a hundred times Who knows what kind of people they were whose love found love When I asked for budding flowers, I got a garland of thorns\nSuch people have never existed. Here whoever has asked for budding flowers has been defeated by thorns. In this world there is nothing but thorns. Yes, from afar they appear to be flowers, coming nearer they prove to be thorns. What you don’t have appears lovely, what you have has become worthless. There is attraction for the absent. ‘The distant drum sounds pleasing.’\nOnly those will start on a journey of yoga, of union, who are completely clear that it is not possible to attain happiness here. Happiness is impossible in the world, because the world means the outward journey – going out of oneself. And going out of oneself no one can ever attain happiness. The further you go from yourself the more you become opposed to your nature. And to dissolve in your nature is happiness. To become submerged in oneself is happiness. Nature is happiness, unnature is misery.\nSo the further you go from yourself – in wealth, in power, in prestige – the more you go on becoming miserable. The world does not mean these trees, these stars and moon. The world means the fleeing outward away from the heart. The outward journey is the world. The inward journey is religion.\nLook with close attention at your life a little. Think about it, then only can these eternal words of Gorakh be understood. And why only Gorakh? No words of any awakened one will be of any use to you if you have not examined your own life. Still you go on hoping. Your hopes have still not been demolished.\nThe ocean of the world is absolutely fake Look, not even a lip is moist.\nIt appears that water is rippling, but appears so only from afar. It is a mirage. When you go near, not even the lips can be moistened. Water reaching the throat is out of the, not even the lips are moistened.\nGreen does not even exist in this region\nO Majnu are you sowing seeds of desire in your heart?\nOn this land greenery has never existed. You are uselessly planting seeds of wanting in your heart. You will repent much. These seeds never sprout.\nGreen does not even exist in this region\nO Majnu are you sowing seeds of desire in your heart?\nWhy do you go on planting seed of new desires? The old seeds never came up but you sow new seed. You have been doing this for life after life.\nI came right in but not a drop in my hands Water far off in showy mirage.\nO Shiva! Real gold assay color is not on the stone, You know blue fills that other sky.\nHere presence is absence, and absence is presence, You speak truly, no one hears.\nMuch entanglement of this world, in presence an absence, what exists is forgotten. What exists is not seen.\nHere presence is absence, and absence is presence,\nAnd our emotions remain entangled in what is not. You are stuck on what you do not have. You will be surprised knowing this.\nPeople think that they are hung up on what they have. This is wrong. You are not even a little stuck on what you have, you are stuck on what you don’t have. If you have ten thousand rupees you are not hung up there. You are stuck on the ten million that you don’t have. Even if you drop this ten thousand it will not help. Until the ten million drops that you don’t have.\nIt feels very absurd that we are entangled in what is not. You are not entangled with the wife you have. You have long been free of her. You have stopped even looking at her. You can’t even recognize her. How many days has it been, how many years, since you took an eyeful of your wife? Who looks at ones wife? People look at others’ wives.\nYou are hung up on what is not near. The absent has entangled you. This is why the master’s job is very difficult to work out. He has to take away from you what you don’t have. And he gives you what you have. If you go near you won’t find even a drop there, where it seemed an ocean was pounding.\nThis deception is like the sky’s blue appearance. It just appears so. The sky has no color. The sky is not a thing that can be colored. The sky is the essence of emptiness. How can you color emptiness? The sky only looks blue.\nO Shiva! Real gold assay color is not on the stone, You know blue fills that other sky.\nIt is definitely proven, now there is scientific proof that the sky has no color, nevertheless it appears blue. And when you are out on a desert wasting with thirst, your thirst gives birth to mirages. And\nnot only ordinary men, extra-ordinary men also fall for mirages. Even Rama went chasing after a golden deer. Do gold deer exist? Have they ever?\nIt is a lovely story. Rama allowed Sita to be lost – not because of Ravana, but because he started chasing a golden deer. If you ask me, it is secondary that Ravana kidnapped Sita. Rama’s squandering Sita is the important thing. Think a little, if it were you, you would have thought, do gold deer exist? Have they ever? But a gold deer appeared and Rama pursued it. He picked up his bow and arrow and then abandoned Sita. He deserted what is for what is not and never was and what never can be. Completely against intelligence, against thought, against understanding – he went after the gold deer.\nBut the story is beautiful. We all go searching for golden deer in just the same way and lose our Sita’s. Sita is your soul, what you have. You have forgotten that. You have turned your back on that. Go in search of a gold deer – fame and position, wealth, respect, honor. These are all gold deer - that have never existed and never will.\nMy existence is like a bubble, This whole spectacle is like wine.\nOpen the eye of the heart to that world, Where status is like a dream.\nJust open your heart a little to that “other world”, because everything here is dream like. Open the eye of the heart to that world,\nOpen the eye of the heart to that truth, push aside the veil, raise the curtain. Where status is like a dream.\nPower here in this world is not more than a dream. My existence is like a bubble,\nAn existence like a bubble, a soap bubble, here one moment, gone the next. This whole spectacle is like wine.\nThis whole mirage-like production goes on, falsely – just because we believe in it.\nAnd what will people not believe! Our whole world is made of beliefs. We believe. The whole thing is belief. And we believe in it so it goes on moving. Those who don’t share this belief will laugh.\nFor the man who runs after money, money is truth. And one who doesn’t run after money, will laugh saying you are mad. What will money do? What will happen with money? It remains behind all the\nsame. One who doesn’t have the belief will be very surprised at what you are running after. But one whose belief it is, his eyes are intoxicated. He is not in his senses.\nThis world is the result of our desiring, our wanting, our running, our ambition. And one who doesn’t immediately wake up from this ambition will never recognize himself. There is no happiness without knowing oneself. There is no music without knowing oneself. There is no taste of the eternal nectar without knowing oneself. These sutras are for this search for the eternal nectar.\nLISTEN O EMPEROR, TO THOUGHTS OF PURE INTELLIGENCE\nGorakh says, O EMPEROR! He is calling you an emperor, remember, because you are an emperor, only you believe you are a beggar. You are the master, you believe you are a slave. You believe, so you have become a slave.\nLISTEN O EMPEROR, TO THOUGHTS OF PURE INTELLIGENCE\nListen to a few words of understanding, of awareness. Or will you go on running, go on escaping? Won’t you stop? Won’t you stop and think a little that you have run much, and where have you reached? Just look back at it once again.\n... THIS DREAM WORLD ARISES FROM FIVE ELEMENTS\nThose things that you are running after, there is nothing there, just the play of the five elements. Earth, water, air, fire, ether – this whole play is created from them. There is nothing in this play. And what you are searching for is present inside of you. That which is beyond the five elements is present within you. These five elements are made and disappear. They fall and rise, they are waves. With them you can never become ecstatic, before they are fully made they start disappearing. How can your life be with them? They are momentary. And you get misery from what is momentary. Search a little for what is eternal. And that is sitting inside you.\nIf you look carefully at this world then the remembrance that you are the observer starts coming. And if you look at it unconsciously then the observer is just forgotten. You are caught up in the seen. One who is caught up in the seen has gone astray. And one who is awakened in the seer has arrived.\nCOMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT,\nSHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.\nGorakh says, O emperor, I have four things to tell to you. Gorakh pours his entire life’s thinking into these four things.\nCOMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT\nFour things: the first is commencement, inception, start, beginning. Commencement means until now you are running outwardly, you have not even commenced the inner journey. You have not turned your gaze backwards. You have not looked back. What Mahavira calls pratikraman, returning back.\nThe mind has two states - aakraman, violence... Aakraman means outward, pratikraman means inward. Aakraman is to the other, pratikraman is to oneself. Or what Patanjali has called pratyahar – turning in.\nReturn, return to yourself. This is what Jesus has called conversion. Conversion does not mean that a Hindu becomes a Christian, or a Christian becomes a Hindu. Is this conversion? Conversion means outer journey converted to inner journey. Don’t search for the temple outside, search within. You don’t go to the outer bathing shrines, you take an inner bath. You take a dip in meditation, and life transformation begins. This transformation Gorakh calls commencement. Only then do you begin to be human. Animals live outwardly, plants also. Man is the only one on this earth who can life inwardly. Only he has the potential that can witness the inner being.\nAll run outwardly, there is nothing special in this. Dignity begins in your life the day you start returning inward. You become glorious. You become majestic. You become dignified. You become human. The inner birth of your being has happened. The quest for the divine has begun inside of you. And this is the greatest revolution. No other revolution is so great. It is inner revolution. This Gorakh calls this commencement.\nHe says, listen O Emperor! You have not even commenced your empire. You have not swung the first stroke of your pick axe to start excavating the mine of wealth you are master of.\nThe second: vessel. Vessel means clay pot. This is the body, the vessel of clay. This vessel is a temple. Within it the master is hidden. Inside this pot the sky is hidden. Do not get entangled with the outer pot because when you turn inward you will find that the body is not as small as you understood. The body is very mysterious. The body is a universe unto itself.\nScientists say that in each body there are at least seventy million cells. This is why we call the being purush – master of the city – because the body is a city, a well populated city. Bombay is smaller. Calcutta is also smaller. The population of Calcutta is ten million, the population of your body is fifty million, fifty million cells. Your body is created by fifty million cells living together.\nThis is no small event. Don’t be deceived looking at the small boundary of the body. Now you know that scientists have discovered atomic power. An atom, which cannot be seen by the eye. But if the atom is exploded, then in ninety seconds Hiroshima, with a population of one hundred thousand, is reduced to ash. Such a vast energy can be hidden in what cannot be seen by the naked eye. Then the body is very big. A very vast energy is hidden with in. It has great secrets.\nIf you turn inward the first thing you will discover is the body. The body is a temple. If you go into the temple, then first you will climb the temple steps, you will pass through the temple walls, you will enter the door, then you can reach the inner shrine, the inner home. Hence, first begin the inner journey, then you will become familiar with this home. Otherwise meeting the inner master will not be possible.\nNaturally do not go against this body. Don’t start torturing it. Otherwise you will not be able to understand. This is god’s very loving gift. Do not suppress, do not torture, do not harass. To suppress, torture, harass it is a denial of god, it is atheistic.\nA believer gives thanks to the divine saying what a lovely body you have given. From earth such a form has been fashioned! Such magic with just five elements. God is a magician. His magic is the greatest... the greatest proof, if any is possible, is your body.\nScientists say so much work happens in the body, if we have to do all this in a factory, then its noise will be heard four miles away. We have not yet discovered how. Science has advanced very far. It has put man on the moon. It has exploded atomic bombs. And now we have produced so many atom bombs that we can reduce the entire planet to ash, not just once but a thousand times. In spite of this great advance in science, science has not yet been able to convert a single piece of bread into blood. Converting bread into blood is still not possible. This miracle happens in your body. And not just that it makes blood from bread, it makes flesh. Bread also makes your brain. Bread also makes your thoughts. And through some unknown door bread ignites your consciousness.\nIt is said, “When hungry, no singing praises of Krishna Gopala.” A hungry man cannot pray. A hungry man does not have the energy necessary for singing prayers, for bhajan. A full belly is needed for prayer song. Hence, in a country that becomes poor bhajan disappears or becomes false. In this country bhajan was once true, because the the country was rich. At least people were receiving their daily bread, no one was dying of starvation. In those days Buddha was born, Mahavira was born, Gorakh was born, Patanjali and Krishna... and we were at great heights. At least people were not starving. They were wealthy, not that I am saying that they had a great heap of wealth, this I am not saying. But they were not hungry. The body was satisfied. Bhajan could arise.\nWhen a country is poor, then communism arises there, not religion. Then people become ready for death and dying. Then there is cornering and pressing demands on authorities, there are strikes, riots, murders and violence. Then bhajan does not arise. A starving man can do violence, not love. A starving man is angry, a starving man cannot be compassionate.\nI say unto you, if this country remains poor a long time – as the leaders of this country have decided it will remain poor – if this country remains long poor, then no possibility except communism will remain. Knowingly or unknowingly this country is being taken towards communism. Perhaps those who are taking it do not know this, they are unaware of it. Perhaps their efforts are that the country not become communist. But it is not a of your efforts, if the country remains poor, then nothing is possible except communism. Bhajan cannot be born.\nAct quickly! This country’s poverty, this country’s starvation must be destroyed. Otherwise it will fall into a great ditch which it will be hard to get out of. Getting free of the slavery of the English was not as difficult. If this country should become communist, then breaking these chains of bondage will be impossible, almost impossible. If a country like Russia cannot break them then we will not be able to break out. We have easily become enslaved and we have readily remained enslaved for thousands of years. And communism is a terrible slavery. Yes, bread will be available and being will be taken away. But purchasing bread at this price is great slavery.\nBread can be made. A little understanding is necessary. Making bread is not difficult. But our foolishness is so ancient that the reasons why we are poor are the same reasons we go on increasing. And we are enemies of the methods that can destroy poverty .\nThis is the reason behind Indira’s defeat, the whole cause is that she made great efforts that somehow the population of the country be controlled. Without this the country can never become\nrich. Becoming rich is far away, it cannot even get a full belly. This is the reason for her defeat. The reason for Indira’s defeat, in total, was that she tried in every way to impose compulsory family planning onto this country. Only if family planning is imposed can this country be saved from poverty. The population has become six hundred million. As this century draws to a close, the population will become one billion. We do not have the capacity that we can fill the stomachs of one billion people. People will get hungrier every day. And the hungrier they get the more enraged they will be. And the more enraged, the more communist they will become. By themselves! This is an inevitable process.\nIndira was defeated because she made real effort to do the right job. And that job is such that it has to be done by force, otherwise it will not happen. If you leave people to themselves, they will not be ready to accept it. People don’t care, people are not aware. They say, god gives children, who are we to stop them? They will go on producing children – go on producing children like rabbits. And the country will go on getting poorer every day. They do not know what they are doing. It will have to be forcibly stopped, only then can it stop, otherwise it will not stop.\nIt has to be stopped with compulsion. People will be upset, because their ancient habits are being interfered with. A man whose only joy is to have as many children as possible, if he is stopped and told two or three only, he will become angry, because his father produced twelve children and he is limited to two or three. In his family tradition such a thing has never happened.\nHindu pandits and priests are angry, Muslim priests and scholars are also angry, because their share might decrease. Their concern is that Muslim population not decrease. Their concern is that Hindu population not decrease. The Jainas are concerned that Jainas do not decrease. If their numbers decrease then their power will decrease. No one is concerned that if you all increase your numbers, Muslims increase, Hindus increase, Jainas increase, this whole country will die.\nAll these priests and scholars, joined together and supported Indira’s defeat. This is not accidental. If Indira did any wrong it is only one: that she tried to do the right thing, which this country’s convention- bound mind-set did not like. You defeated Indira and installed senile old people, in whom there is no hope, who have no ability, with whom the country can have no future. But all joined together, all reactionaries and retrogressive elements. The whole stupidity of this country joined together.\nDo you see what a miracle it was? All political parties, whose principles have nothing in common, whose channels of thought have nothing in common, all were ready to gather together. Such opportunism you will never find in the world, where their principles, all their philosophies, all their great ideas were put aside in one moment for political power. It is amazing that Socialists, Congress party, and the right wing Jana Sangha all joined together. But also not amazing, because Muslims, Hindus all ancient voices, all conservatives put the pressure on.\nIt is as if this country decided to remain poor. If it is to remain poor, there is no possibility of bhajan, of singing prayers arising.\nWhat is true for the individual, is also true for the society, is also true for the country and true also for all of mankind. Your body should be joyous, should be delighted, should be healthy.\nSo the second task of a yogi is to keep the body happy, healthy, blossoming. The body is like a flower. It is smiling. It is filled with joy. This temple is the lord’s, it should be decorated with garlands and wreaths.\nBut your so called sadhus and sannyasins go on teaching you the reverse. They have given poison. They have taught that the body is the enemy. If you are to achieve god then you must destroy the body, torture it, let it decay, place it on a bed of thorns. Beat the body. The more you beat it, the closer you reach to god.\nThis is a lie. This is one hundred per cent false. The more you destroy the body, the lower the temple will fall. And if the temple falls, there is the fear that the idol too will go down. This is a temple. It needs to be respected. In Gorakh’s opinion there is great respect for the body. Hence he says: first begin the inner journey, then take care of the temple.\nThe second thing is vessel. First is commencement. Vessel – then take care of this temple. He is hidden somewhere in it, his treasure is hidden. All of the methods of yoga are to take care of it. Restraint, rules, breathing, withdrawal of senses... These are not to destroy the body. They are to protect the body. These are for the beauty, the health, the energy of the body. The body will be delighted from these. Flowers will bloom in it. By means of these the roots of the body will deeply enter the earth.\nAnd the third thing is recognition. When your body becomes beautiful, full of music, rhythmical, when there is poetic meter in your body, a joyful madness, then you will recognize consciousness with consciousness. Then you will receive the first glimpse of the one who is hidden within this body. You will enter the temple. Unhappy, crying, hungry you cannot enter into it. It can happen only mounted on the a wave of health.\nCOMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT\nWhen recognition has happened, then decision – then attainment. Before this do not say that god exists or not. Before this do not say that nirvana exists or not. Before this do not make any conclusions, neither yes nor no, neither a believer nor an atheist. Any conclusions made before this are not based on your own experience. They are borrowed, they stink, they are given by others. Who knows if they have given them correctly or incorrectly. Who knows if the others are deceiving? Who knows if they themselves are deceived, even if they are not trying to deceive you? Who knows?\nMan should remember, I will trust only in my own knowledge. I will be my own source. I will become my own lamp. Then decide. This is a very lovely idea. First the inner journey, then right care of the body, then the experience of consciousness, meditation, then the attainment of samadhi.\nSHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.\nAnd Gorakh says, if you do this much then you will become conscious that you are an emperor. The master of masters is sitting inside of you. The lord of lords is sitting inside of you. But you go on running. You don’t know where – where are you running? – except for where you are, you are running everywhere.\nI have heard a story, that when god first created the world he lived right here in the middle of the market, on Mahatma Gandhi Road. Naturally, he had made the world, so he lived in the world. But people started bothering him too much. Complaining and complaining. This is not right, that is not right. And the complaints were so contradictory that even if one wanted to fulfill them it couldn’t be\ndone. Someone says don’t let it rain tomorrow because I am dying some clothes and they have to dry. Someone else says let it rain tomorrow because we have planted seeds, they shouldn’t dry out. One says let the sun come out tomorrow, another says don’t let the sun come tomorrow because I am going on a trip, it is better if there is shade. God must have started going crazy. Whose suggestion should he follow? If one is done, many cannot be done. If one is done, the other one is denied. He started getting frightened. People wouldn’t let him sleep either day or night. In the middle of the night they would come and knock at the door saying do it this way, do it that way, tomorrow morning don’t let the sun out at all, tomorrow let the sun shine early because I have to work in the fields, it is difficult in the dark.\nHe called the gods, called his viziers, saying tell me some way out, I will go mad. Where can I hide? Save me from my people. I made them, now they are making it difficult for me. I made a mistake when I made man.\nThis is why, you know, that after man god did not make anything more. Awareness dawned, he got smart. Before man he had created much: plants, birds and beasts, mountains and rivers, moon and stars, then man. And he made man, then made nothing more. Millions of years have passed since then, god has been sitting with his hands completely still, not making a thing. This mistake is such that his courage has broken to go beyond it.\nSo he said I am not going to make anything. But what is made is made. Where can I hide? Someone said, hide in the Himalayas, on Mount Everest. He said, very soon - you may not know it - after a few moments have passed Hillary and Tenzing will climb Everest. And once they reach then busses will come and hotels will be made and Mahatma Gandhi Road... People will start coming by helicopter. You don’t know, after just a few days. That place will be no solution.\nSo someone said, on the moon... So He said, that won’t work either. Soon Armstrong will reach there. And then the Russians will reach and troubles will start. Then an old god came and said something into his ear and He was happy. He said, this is right, this fits. The old one said, try this, hide inside of man. Man will go off to the moon and stars, but he will never go within. He will never remember.\nSince then god has been hiding within you and in great joy. Only once in a while a Gorakh-yeti reaches. But by then all his complaints have dropped. So god is simply delighted to see him. Meeting him He just dances. Not just any fool can reach there. They don’t have time with all their trips to Delhi. Some Gorakh-yeti, some Gautam Buddha, some Vardhaman Mahavira... but sitting with such people He too is delighted. In their company he is happy. The gathering comes together, round after round of honey. The juiciest things must have been said, or songs must have been sung, or dance, or drums beaten, or the strings of the veena played.\nBut god is within you. You are god.\nSHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.\nIf you go within, take a little awareness, complete these four things, receive the attainment, receive the goal of life, the meaning of life.\nTO BEGIN, DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO...\nAnd if you want to begin this journey then you will have to drop sex. Sex means without others I cannot go on. The other is absolutely needed. If you are a woman a man is needed, if you are a man a woman is needed. The other is needed, the opposite is needed. And the opposite is outside so man are running after women, women are running after men.\nBecoming free of sex means: first I will find out: Who am I? In reality do I need the other or not? I still don’t know who I am, but I am seeking the other! One who becomes acquainted with himself is surprised, the other is not needed at all. One’s own being is sufficient.\n... DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO...\nAnd one who has thrown sex, one who has no need of the other, from him anger drops by itself. Anger is the shadow of sex. Only a sexual person can be angry. Why? Because if someone creates a barrier between him and his desiring, him and what he desires, then anger arises. How can you make someone angry if he has no sexual desire? No matter what obstacle you put, he has no desire. There is no suffering from your obstacle. Your obstacle does not appear to be an obstacle.\nJesus has said, “If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer him the other. And if someone takes your coat, offer him your shirt. And if someone asks you to carry his burden one mile, take it two miles.”\nOne who has no desires, won’t have any problem. One who has no need of the other, cannot be disturbed by the other. This is something to be understood. Others can disturb you as long as you need them. Hence great disturbance arises. The husband needs the wife, hence the wife can disturb. The wife needs the husband, hence the husband can disturb. This is why lovers love each other and remain angry with each other and even fight and quarrel. Why? The one we are dependent on – this dependence brings trouble because our key is in their hand. We do not remain our own master.\nHence lovers go on fighting over who is boss, me or you? After marriage husband and wife have a single struggle, who is really the boss? They don’t say this openly... it cannot be said openly. They make political claims. It doesn’t have to be said. The wife makes her moves. The husband makes his. Both of them place their own pieces on the board - who is the boss? From any excuse it has to be proven who is the boss. If the wife says something, the husband opposes it whether it is something to be opposed or not. If the husband says something the wife has to oppose it. Trivial things like which movie to go see and there is an argument.\nOne day their was a great argument between Mulla Nasruddin and his wife. For an hour, an hour and a half there was a very heated exchange. Then Mulla went outside. His condition was as if he had been beaten. He slipped out. He walked around in the cool air, the mind become a little quiet. It was a small matter – which film to go to? He thought, what is there in this small matter? Its okay let’s do what she want’s. He became a little aware. Why quarrel? And quarreling will be expensive. Now hunger is starting to arise. Now she will not cook any food. I will have to sleep at night, now she will not allow sleep. She will throw pillows. Upside down or right side up she will provoke some disturbance, or turn the radio up too loud. Quarrels are not so easy, they cannot be patched up so easy. When you start a disturbance it will go on continuing. Thinking over and understanding everything, carefully calculating he said to himself, It is better that we go see the film that she says is good to see. He came inside and said, “Be happy, I will do what you want, I accept what you want. Lets go see the film you want to see.”\nHis wife looked at him and said, “But now I have changed my mind. Agreeing to that means nothing now. I don’t want to see that film.”\nIf the intention is to quarrel it makes no difference. It is an excuse.\nBut lovers quarrel, psychologists say that the fundamental reason is that as soon as you fall in love you begin to understand that your happiness is dependent on someone else. The other will give when they give. If the other withdraws, then they withdraw. You do not remain your own master. You have become a slave. There is suffering from enslavement. From suffering, anger arises; from anger, struggle.\nSex and anger go together. And where there is sex and anger, in the middle between them ego arises. If you are victorious over others, then ego becomes strong. If you are defeated by the other, the ego becomes hidden, goes beneath the surface of the earth. Another path is found to defeat someone else.\nOne who has no desire, nor any anger, his ego dissolves by itself. Sex and anger are the two wings which fly the bird of ego.\nTO BEGIN, DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO, DREAMS OF THE MIND AND IMPURITIES OF INDULGENCE.\nDrop the idea that something can be received from outside. No one has ever received or ever will receive anything. The more you ask, the more you are troubled, the more you are sad.\nI longed for the moon and stars\nI got nothing but the black ink of night\nI am that poem that did not find love’s gathering, I am that traveller who arrived at no destination, wounds I have received, I longed for springtime I longed for the moon and stars\nNo curling locks, no skirt’s hem to comfort me Not even faded stars cross my path\nMy eyes longed for the sights\nI longed for the moon and stars\nUseless desires came to reside in my heart I set out to bring light and got darkness\nI longed for the streaming of color and light I longed for the moon and stars\nI got nothing but the black ink of night\nNo one has ever received anything else – they received the black ink of night. Ask for moon and stars, you are are free to ask. But nothing happens according to your request. Through your asking you have become a beggar. Through your becoming a beggar your value has dropped. You have become scattered around, far from god. Become a master. If you are to meet that master, then become a master. Only a master can meet a master. There is a meeting of like qualities. Becoming a beggar you cannot meet god. Only becoming a master can you meet. Only becoming like him will you be able to meet.\nWhat does it mean to become a master? That no desiring remains - not for maya, not for sex, not for greed, not for wealth, not for power, no desire remains. You have said: I accept all as you have made me. I accept myself as I am. Just as I am, I accept completely. In such a state an emperor is born inside of you. Then even if you are a beggar you have an emperor. Now even if you are an emperor it is only in name, inside you are only a beggar.\n... DREAMS OF THE MIND AND IMPURITIES OF INDULGENCE.\nRENOUNCE WORLDLY CRAVINGS, DROP GREED, THEY CATCH THE SWAN AND KILL IT.\nAll these dreams will gang up, grab your soul and murder it. Inside you they will wring the neck of the swan.\nRENOUNCE WORLDLY CRAVINGS, DROP GREED, THEY CATCH THE SWAN AND KILL IT.\nDrop this misery. Drop this greed. These have murdered you. You have been finished by their poison.\nDROP THE DUAL, REMAIN NON-DUAL\nDrop this language of two. Drop the language of I and you. Become non-dual. Where you is gone, the desire for you is gone, there I also goes. Then a silence remains. Silence - as is seen after a storm. Or silence - as comes before a storm. Or silence - if you understand then it is also in the center of the storm. If you are aware there is silence in the market too. There is always silence within. There it is eternal peace. If you learn to take a dip within the outer noise cannot shatter it, no outer barrier will be a barrier.\nDROP THE DUAL, REMAIN NON-DUAL, RENOUNCE EMBRACING, REMAIN UNBOUND,\nDrop this embrace of others, because you become bound by this embrace. Your life has become a prison because of others. Through others life has become enchained. It is a barrier of others into which you have fallen.\n... RENOUNCE EMBRACING, REMAIN UNBOUND\nDo you want to be liberated? Do you want to be free? Do you want the infinity and freedom of the sky? Then you will have to learn to be non-dual.\nNATURALNESS IS TECHNIQUE, ASANA HAPPENS...\nLearn the natural, spontaneous spiritual practice. NATURALNESS IS TECHNIQUE! This is the real union. What is the natural practice? Not wanting to be anything. From wanting to be, from the desire to be something, man becomes unnatural. When you want to be something, then an ideal comes in front of you - to be this.\nAssume you wanted to become Buddha, what will you do? If you want to be Buddha, you start imitating Buddha. You will forget who you are. You will start behaving like Buddha. If you want to be a Mahavira, you will stand naked like Mahavira. This is not your own. If you want to be something, if some ideal enters your life, you become false.\nWith ideals comes hypocrisy. An ideal means in the future there is a star like I want to be - like Mahavira, Krishna, Buddha. And do you know that Buddha has never happened again. No other person can be like Buddha, nor is there any need to be. Nor has there ever been another Mahavira. You were born only to be you, you were not born to be anything else. And Buddha could only become Buddha because he did not try to become Krishna. Nor did he try to become Rama. Buddha could become Buddha because he plunged into his own being. You also can only be you. You are unique. There has never been a person like you, nor will there be. God does not repeat. God is not a broken down gramophone record that goes on playing the same song, the same song, the same song.\nGod is eternally new, flowing, dynamic. He is not a pond filled with stagnant water, decaying and rotting. He is flow, current. He is the Ganges, he is flowing.\nUnnaturalness arises from ideals. Man has become hypocritical, unnatural, complicated - because of ideals. People are teaching each other. Mom and dad are teaching their children - become like this... or look you should become like Buddha, or become like Alexander, or become like so and so. No mom and dad say to their children, you are to become you, avoid Buddhas. Avoid Mahaviras. They have happened. They were beautiful, had greatness, but if you are to learn one thing from them then learn to live your own self, you also live your own self. Do not copy behavior, do not imitate. Imitation and copying behavior make man false, because duality arises. You are something, you put something over, it becomes double. You are one thing, you do something else. You are one thing, you say something else. Your clothes are one thing, your soul something else. There is a difference between your outer and inner color. Your interiority is divided and to be divided is unnatural.\nThe meaning of natural is, undivided living. You live just like you are.\nThink about this a little. This is a very important thing. Live just like you are. Bad then bad, good then good. Let the whole world become acquainted with who you are. Uncover yourself. Say, this is how I am. This is my fate. This is how god has made me. It is his choice. If the world accepts, fine. If they don’t accept, fine.\nWhen you want the world to accept you then this problem begins. Then it will be that you have to become like the world wants. When you want the world to give you respect, then trouble begins\nbecause the world gives respect according to its conditions. It you fulfill their conditions, then they will give respect. If their conditions are not fulfilled they will disrespect you.\nThe man who wants to be something will become fearful. He who is fearful is weak. He has lost his soul. Don’t wish to be anything. As you are is sufficient. You are participating in god’s vision, otherwise you just wouldn’t exist. He has accepted you.\nThere is a story from Junnaid’s life. Junnaid came to stay at a new village. He was a Sufi fakir, a great fakir. His next door neighbor was a mischievous man, a troublemaker. For three or four days he watched, until it became more than he could endure. One dusk he was praying, bowing on his prayer rug, after prayers he said, O lord, end this man’s life. What need is there of him? He is my neighbor. He is a disturbance and nothing else. He is torturing your people, harassing them, he is evil.\nJunnaid had never had received an answer from god to a prayer, that day it came. God said, Junnaid, you have been here four days. I have been with this man for sixty years. He has been my neighbor for sixty years, because all are my neighbors. I have tolerated him for sixty years, you cannot tolerate four days? And when I tolerated him for sixty years, there must be something, there must be some secret. You should have thought, at least before praying, that one whom God has accepted, what complaint can you have?\nThis is lovely. From that day on Junnaid never prayed to improve any man. Let him be as god wishes. As he is is fine. Who am I?\nSome people brought a woman to Jesus and said, “She has committed adultery. It is written in the ancient scriptures, that she should be stoned to death. What do you think?”\nJesus was sitting on the bank of a river. He must have fallen deep in thought: “If I tell them to stone her to death, it will be violence.” Then what will happen to Jesus’ principle of love? “And if I say no, pardon her, people will be angry. People will say you are speaking against our ancient religion, you are repudiating our ancient scriptures.” In reality that is what people wanted. The people had come just to stone Jesus with these stones if he said to pardon her, because he is speaking in opposition to our religious scriptures. And if he says to stone her, we will kill this woman and then say to Jesus: “What happened to your love? To your compassion? Where has your compassion gone? Where has your love gone? It was all phoney talk.”\nBut they did not know what Jesus will answer. Jesus said the ancient scriptures are right. They must be right. Take up stones and kill this woman – but let only those throw stones who have never committed adultery nor who have ever even thought of committing adultery.\nAnd the five who had stood before the villagers, probably all mayors and members of the municipal committee, quickly retreated into the crowd. Who wants trouble? The whole village knew. Everyone’s mischief was known. And if they hadn’t committed adultery they certainly had thought of it. To find a man who has not thought of adultery is difficult, one who has not been infatuated, who has not been attracted. All quietly moved back. Slowly slowly the people who had come with stones in their hands let the stones fall where they stood. And slowly slowly people began to disappear.\nEvening was falling, the sun was setting. Just as the sun set and it started getting dark, people escaped from there. The woman was left behind, alone. The woman put her head at Jesus’ feet and said, “Give me whatsoever punishment you want. I am an adulteress. I accept it. I am a sinner. And your compassion has overwhelmed my heart. Whatsoever punishment you want to give...”\nJesus said, “Who am I to mete out punishments? Who am I to stand between you and your god? You know, you know what you need to do, and your god knows. I am not going to make any judgement. If you feel you have done something bad, then don’t do it any more. And if it feels alright to you then continue. The one to decide is god. The final decision will be between you and god. There is no intermediary. Go now.”\nConsider what he is saying. A famous statement of Jesus is: “Resist not evil.” Not even evil! Why? If god is allowing it to happen, there must be some reason. Wake up within, live within. But the true thread of life emerges in you.\nNATURALNESS IS TECHNIQUE, ASANA HAPPENS...\nIf your life becomes spontaneous, it stops, by itself the ASANA comes, sitting comes. This is the real yoga posture, the real ASANA. Crossing your legs and sitting in Siddhasana is not the real yoga posture. Anyone can do that. It is just a drill. It is physical exercise. It is good, do it and the body becomes healthy. But you will not find your being this way. If an asana comes spontaneously, from your own space, then the experience of being begins.\n... BODY, MIND, BREATH, BECOME STEADY.\nThen by themselves body, mind, wind and breath start to be at peace, start to be steady. Live spontaneously.\nYou have seen, whenever you tell a lie your breath wavers. Watch. Whenever you lie, your breath will quiver. Its naturalness, its rhythm will break. Whenever you speak the truth its rhythm is continuous.\nBased on this, scientists have made a machine – the lie detector. In the West it is used in the courts. A man may not know it, but there is a machine beneath his feet. When he stands in court, a machine is placed beneath him and its graph is produced in front of the judge. Like the graph of a cardiogram, his graph is produced in front of the judge. The man is asked, what time does the clock show now? He says nine fifteen. Why should he lie? There is a clock in the court. The graph continues. He is asked, how many people are there here? He counts and says fifteen. Why should he lie? How can he lie? The graph continues.\nTwo or three questions are asked like this, which he cannot lie about. Then he is asked, did you steal? His heart wants to say yes, because if he did, he knows it in his heart. So his heart says, yes! And he suppresses this yes. And from his head he says no. Meanwhile his breath starts wavering, the graph starts wavering. He is caught. He was lying.\nNo one can tell a lie without the breath wavering. So a man who lives truthfully, lives naturally, his breath becomes steady by itself. You will be surprised to know that in meditation a moment comes spontaneously when the breath completely stops. Completely! If you put a mirror close in front of a\nperson meditating like this, no vapor shadow will show on the mirror. No sign of breath will appear on the mirror. Ordinarily if a mirror is brought near the nose, vapor is breathed out and shows on the mirror. And sometimes a person in meditation becomes frightened that perhaps he is dying. There is no need to be afraid. You are not dying, for the first time you are touching life, touching the ultimate life. Everything stops, even the breath stops. There is such a deep peace that all coming and going stops.\nAWAKEN SANYAM, THE BALANCE, CONSCIOUS AHAR, THE INTAKE\nSANYAM means to be in the middle. Not going to this extreme, nor to that. Not too much food nor too little. Not too much sleep nor too little. Live in the middle.\nAWAKEN sanyam...\nAnd in the mind of one in whom centering has come, the middle has come, all is corrected.\n... THE BALANCE, CONSCIOUS AHAR, THE INTAKE...\nThen eat suitable food, suitable AHAR. Don’t eat junk aahaar. Aahaar is a great word. Its meaning is not just food. Aahaar means whatever you take in. A man comes and starts gossiping. One who is centered will say, “Brother don’t feed me this ahar. Don’t pour this useless gossip in my ears. What’s the use? I have no interest in it. This is feeding junk to my ears.” A man who eats suitable aahaar will not take in junk. He will not take in useless stuff. Why? Because it too is aahaar. He will not look at useless scenes. He will not sit at the television watching fighting and violence. He will not go to the movies to see the same well trodden stories again and again, the same love, the same triangle, seeing the same thing again and again. He will not take this rubbish inside, because you are created from whatever you pour inside. Food is not the only aahaar, everything that you take in is aahaar.\n... RENOUNCE SLUMBER THE DEATH OF LIFE\nAnd such an individual will let go of unconsciousness. Don’t understand RENOUNCE SLUMBER as meaning he will never sleep. He will sleep but now he will not sleep unmindfully. This is a matter to consider. Now he will not be unmindfully awake either. You are sleeping even though you are awake. You are walking on the road and a thousand thoughts are moving, the same old problems. You see neither the road nor the people. You go on walking. If someone asks you abruptly, “On the side of the road you have just passed, there is a tree. Are there flowers blooming on it or not?” You will say I didn’t see a thing. And you pass by there everyday. Daily going to work the same way, coming home the same way, daily... “Flowers bloomed, did you see them?” How could you see? You go on walking along immersed in your thoughts.\nPeople are walking drowned in their own thoughts. They are sleep walking. This is slumber. As you start to be without thoughts, wakefulness will come. Then you will be surprised to find, that this world is very beautiful. When the dust of thoughts is brushed aside, a correct reflection of the world starts happening. When the waves of thought stop inside then the lake became still. On a quiet lake the whole moon descends. The world is filled with unsurpassable colors. But as long as this dust of the mind exists, the world appears dull and boring. It seems as if everything is just the same.\nNothing is just the same. Every day happens anew. The sun you said good by to yesterday, will not be the same sun you say good by to today. Today the evening will blossom new colors. Today there will be a cloud in the sky, there will be new colors. Today the radiance of the sunset will be something different. Today the sunrise was also something different. Everything is changing every moment. This is the meaning of life. Otherwise everything has died. Existence is not dead, existence is a living flow.\nYou have fallen asleep. But you don’t know it. You go on moving, somehow go on moving. Right now your wakefulness is also slumber but a moment of awareness will come, when you are asleep, the body is sleeping, but inside a small lamp of awareness goes on burning.\nIt sometimes happens in your life too. Like when a mother has given birth to a baby. Rains have come, clouds are thundering loudly, lightening is striking. She doesn’t hear it. But the baby whimpers a little and she hears it. What is it? The clouds are thundering in the sky, lightning is falling and the mother doesn’t even know about it. She is blissfully snoring. She is fast asleep. The baby whimpers, just a little, and that very moment she is awake. Within her someone is awake, a small part is awake watching for signs if the baby is having any problem. Her motherhood is awake.\nHere if all of you sleep, and someone comes and calls out Rama, then no one else will hear it. But the man whose name is Rama will say, brother, why are you harassing me? Won’t you let me sleep? No one else will hear it. The sound Rama fell on everyone’s ears. But everyone knows it, even in sleep they know it, know that this is not my name. They have come to bother someone else. If someone asks you in the morning, you will not be able to says that you had heard Rama. You will say I don’t know anything. But Rama has heard it.\nI have heard, in a village a miserly man died. His wife just sat there. She didn’t cry. A crowd had gathered. People wondered if she hadn’t gone insane from the shock of it. And just then a beggar came and stood before them. He beat loudly on his tin in front the corpse of the dead man lying there. As soon as the beggar beat his tin the woman started to cry. The neighbors were puzzled. They asked, what is it? She said, now I am certain that he has died. If he doesn’t rise and come into the house seeing a beggar, then he has died. He has definitely died. Until now I was suspicious that he may have fallen unconscious, but now it is certain. No matter how unconscious, if he saw a beggar he would come in the house. Now it is certain that the soul has left the body.\nIn your ordinary life also you will notice that sometimes, in certain rare moments, something remains awake inside of you. As a student during finals week knows at night that he keeps a little awake, several times he opens his eyes and looks to see what time it is. Is it morning yet? The exams are sitting on his head, a single tone stays awake inside of him. These are small experiences of this.\nA lamp is burning continuously in the yogi. This is why Krishna has said, when the whole earth is sleeping the sanyami, the centered one, is awake. What for everyone else is sleep, deep in the night, for the sanyami that too is wakefulness. This does not mean that Krishna never slept, that he stood up the whole night. He would go crazy. Or that he played on his flute all night, whether there were listeners or not. He himself would go mad and the neighbors too would go mad. He sleeps, but only his body sleeps, his consciousness remains awake.\nRENOUNCE SLUMBER THE DEATH OF LIFE\nThis unconsciousness has deprived you of the higher life. This is the real death. If you let go of it, you will experience ultimate life.\nDROP ALL THE JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA\nHe is saying to his yogis, to his disciples, to his sannyasins, don’t fall into all these hassles of tantra, mantra, yantra - of tying on talismans, of giving this mantra to people, of giving packets of ash, of preparing magic potions!\nDROP ALL THE JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA, ANCIENT MEDICINE, ALL DECEIT.\nDrop all this deceit. Don’t get stuck in all of this. In this country sadhus have been stuck in these for too long. They do all kinds of things. They give medicines to the sick, they do miracles, they produce sacred ash in their hands from nowhere and distribute the ash, they produce talismans, produce watches. This is all deceit, just sleight of hand. . These are all magic tricks.\nIf a street magician does these things you don’t fall at his feet and cry out, O Sai Baba. I have found you, I was searching for you. No, you know it is magic. Thinking it is magic, you understand it is some sleight of hand. But if someone comes dressed in the ochre robes of a sadhu and starts doing it, you just fall at his feet. It is just the same, there is no difference, there is no difference.\nGorakh says to his disciples:\nDROP ALL JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA, MEDICINE, AMULET, METALS AND STONES.\nALL THIS MEDICINEMANSHIP WILL ONLY LEAD YOU TO THE KING’S DOOR, THE POLITICS.\nAnd if you get into this kind of business, the nonsense of sacred ash packets etc, then one day or another you will get entangled in politics, you will arrive at the palace gates.\nThe meaning of politics is position and fame, greed for power. If you get into this sort of business you will become greedy for power, otherwise what are you doing? All these ambitions are so people will understand you are someone - significant, great. A seeker should be natural, that I am nothing, that I am empty. He should have no claim. How can any religious seeker show miracles? Only the unreligious can show miracles, because behind miracles is the desire of the ego to be worshipped.\nDROP ENCHANTMENTS OF ALL KINDS AND ALL SORCERY.\nDrop all this black magic - tantric curses, mantra sorcery, tricks of hypnosis, tricks of possessing someone in your power, poisonings. DROP... ALL SORCERY. Ghost and goblin hocus-pocus, using mantras to stop someone’s work – drop all this useless nonsense.\nLISTEN YOGESHWARA TO THE START OF THE PATH OF YOGA.\nAnd he says, O yogis. Listen! I will tell you the real path of the yogi.\n... TO THE START OF THE PATH OF YOGA.\nThe real beginning to the path of yoga – I am opening the door for you.\nRENOUNCE ALL OTHER STATES, MEDITATE WHOLLY ON THE LORD OF THE WORLD.\nDrop all the rest, remember only that one. Every morning I arise and ask of you only you, Except you I have no wishes.\nDrop everything else, they will all waste time and energy. Merge this energy totally into only one prayer. Ask for him and don’t ask for anything else.\nEvery morning I arise and ask of you only you, Except you I have no wishes.\nWith the exception of god may you have no wish. The wish should be such that you are lost in the wish.\nSearching for him, “Mir” was lost Take another look at your searching!\nLook at this seeking of mine, Mir says. I ventured out in search of him and lost myself. Searching for him, “Mir” was lost\nTake another look at your searching!\nLook at this seeking of mine. I ventured out searching and lost myself. Seeking, seeking, O my friend, Kabir became the sought\nOnly that one remains. Be lost, then he is met. I searched long but still he’s not found\nIf he’s found, I’ll not be found.\nI was searching much, but I didn’t meet him. He won’t be met until this self is lost. And when he is met, if I go back and look I will not find myself.\nI searched much but still he’s not found If he’s found, I’ll not be found.\nDrown so much that only one desire remains, only one longing remains. Surrender all longings unto it. If your journey moves in many directions you will reach nowhere.\nMaster the one, all is mastered, Attempt all, all lost.\nRENOUNCE ALL OTHER STATES, MEDITATE WHOLLY ON THE LORD OF THE WORLD. DROPPING ALL KIND OF DRAMA, BURN LUST, ANGER, EGO.\nAnd drop all acting. Stop all dramas. These are all just new forms of lust and anger, these are just new arts of the ego. Be careful of them.\nEYES FULL OF LUST, DON’T WANDER ON PILGRIMAGES FAR AND WIDE\nThe eyes are filled with passions and you are journeying on a pilgrimage. Nothing can come of this.\n... NO NEED TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF MATTED HAIR TANGLED IN HEAVY LOCKS.\nAnd no matter how many dread-locks you grow, no matter how heavy your dreads get, you will never become light and unburdened...\nPLANTING TREES AND MAKING GARDENS\nAnd no matter how much so-called virtue you you go on doing – you have trees planted by the side of the road, or you have gardens planted so travellers are shaded...\n... DO NOT DIE DIGGING WELLS AND POOLS.\nOr have wells dug so that people can get water to drink. But remember Gorakh says:\n... DO NOT DIE DIGGING WELLS AND POOLS.\nYou will fall into the same well and die. Nothing can happen from this kind of virtue. Virtue without meditation is worthless, because it is the ego expanding itself.\nSadhus hold on to ego too. They say, I will not stop until this temple is constructed, I will not stop until this well is dug. They sit stubbornly resolved. And until their temple is built and their well is dug, they go on sitting. Finally people become bothered with this seeker sitting on their hearts every day and they give something saying okay brother, and they see that the well is dug, saying okay brother, and they have the temple constructed. But this is only an expansion of ego.\nI will do merit. In this only the “I” is fulfilled. There is another virtue which is not your doing – which is born out of meditation. I am absorbed in meditation in god, then whatever existence will do through me, I am not the doer. If he wants a well dug, he gets a well dug. If he wants a plant planted he gets a plant planted. If he wants to run a school he runs a school. If he wants a hospital, he will have a hospital made. But I am not the doer, now I am only a medium. First meditation.\nDon’t understand from this that Gorakh is saying that works of merit are bad. Gorakh is saying that as long as there is ego behind the facade of virtuous works, that same ego will be nurtured, will be beautified, will grow bigger. First let the ego go, then virtuous works will come by themselves. Then there is a great fragrance in it, a great beauty, a great music.\nRahim in the heart’s power, how can the body disturb? When its shadow falls on water, the body stays dry.\nOnce in the hands of the heart, one doesn’t worry about the body. One in the grasp of consciousness, doesn’t worry about the body.\nWhen its shadow falls on water...\nAs when you walk on a path and your shadow falls onto the edge of a lake, your body will not wet at all.\nWhen its shadow falls on water, the body stays dry.\nNow your body is not wet. As one’s heart comes into its power, as one’s mind becomes meditation, now whatever he does, however he does it, wherever he goes, no bad result will come. Only the auspicious will come from him, nothing inauspicious can come from him.\nBREATH STOPS, BODY DECAYS, BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING\nThis body will break, soon the breath will be uprooted. BREATH STOPS...\nThe breath will be pulled out.\n... BODY DECAYS...\nThis body will soon become old, it will come close to death. Before this happens:\n... BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING\nO king! O emperor! Take care. Before this, take care. Later you will repent much. When death comes there will nothing left in your hands but repentance. We have wasted our life on things that we cannot take with us. Death will take away everything. All our splendor will be left behind. And we didn’t gather meditation. Meditation can go with you in death. Meditation is the highest wealth. Death cannot take anything from one who has experienced samadhi, because neither weapons can pierce samadhi, nor can fire burn it.\nBREATH STOPS, BODY DECAYS, BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING\nNow take care O king. You are a king, if you take care you will find your kingdom. In a moment, just one moment, the happening can occur.\nINSISTING ON PILGRIMAGES AND VOWS...\nDon’t remain entangled in useless pilgrimages and vows. Don’t waste time.\n... DON’T WASTE YOUR LIFE CLIMBING MOUNTAINS\nAnd don’t torture your spirit with uselessly climbing mountains, going to Girnar, going to Shikraji, climbing the Himalayas: Kailash, Badrinath, Kedar. Why are you torturing your spirit?\n... DON’T WASTE YOUR LIFE CLIMBING MOUNTAINS\nDon’t unnecessarily torture.\nDROP ALL THIS WORSHIP AND RITUALS, CHANTING WITH BEADS...\nAnd how much worship and study have you done already? How much worship, how much chanting? So much chanting done and what has happened?\nDROP ALL THIS WORSHIP AND RITUALS, CHANTING WITH BEADS; ENOUGH PRETENSIONS OF YOGA.\nAnd you have done plenty of yoga. Someone is standing on his head, someone has twisted his body, someone has turned his body. What will happen from all this? This is all a mimicking.\n... ENOUGH PRETENSIONS OF YOGA.\nDon’t uselessly imitate.\nABANDON ALL YOUR BUSINESS AND TRADE OF KNOWLEDGE...\nThese are all occupations. Be careful of these occupations.\n... YOUR STUDYING, CONTEMPLATING AND BEHAVIORISM.\nA very revolutionary sutra. You have studied much, you have become a parrot studying and studying, you have become a pandit studying and studying.\n... YOUR STUDYING, CONTEMPLATING AND BEHAVIORISM.\nAnd you have dyed yourself well with superficial good behavior, you have become very praiseworthy and become well skilled in popular customs. You are expert in etiquette, have become very cultured. But nothing happens from all of this. All this will be left behind. This study and writing, these virtues you are superficially covered over with, and these social conventions will all be left behind. When you go, the bird that goes will be the same as ever. You never paid any attention to it.\nRID YOURSELF OF GATHERING DISCIPLES...\nYou yourself have not yet awakened and you have gathered chelas, disciples! Let yourself awaken then if someone comes, share – if you’ve awakened first! First light your own lamp, then give light to any unlit lamp.\nPeople come to me, saying, “We want to serve people.” I say, “It will be a kindness. It will be a great kindness if you don’t do any service. Still you have not yet done any service to yourself.”\n“No, but,” they say, “we have heard that ‘without service there is no fruit.’” Their eye is on the fruit, this is why they want to serve. Who cares about service?... but from doing service you will go to heaven. The fact is the reverse: services comes to fruition through one who has attained heaven. Life becomes service for one in whom heaven has arrived. And there is service in the actions of one in whose life fruit has rained down. The whole matter is reverse.\nThey have come saying that they want to serve the people. I tell them, see how many do-gooders are doing service for the people and people are just dying. The more do-gooders increase, the more people are caught in traps. Someone is pulling on their arms, someone is pulling on their legs, someone’s got them by the throat. They say we are all drowning. But no one pays any attention that their arms and legs are breaking, that their necks are getting cut. And the do-gooders say, we will continue doing service.\nA Christian priest explained to his boys in school that one should do service, one should do at least one good deed per week. And I give you a week to do your good deed and report back. The next week he asked, have you done your good deed children? Three boys raised their hands. One child said that I did. The Father was very happy. He said, what good deed did you do? He said, as you suggested if an old man or old woman is crossing the street then give them your hand, I helped an old woman cross. Happily the priest said, Wonderful! If you continue learning like this you will go to heaven.\nHe asked the second boy, What good deed did you do? He said, I also helped an old lady across the street. The priest started to get a little suspicious, but thought there is no shortage of old ladies, he must have found one too.\nHe asked the third, what did you do? I too helped an only lady across. The priest asked, The three of you found three old ladies? They said, there were not three, only one. All three of us helped her across. So he asked, are three needed for helping across the street? They said, so what if three did it, if there was six it still would have been difficult. We got her across with difficulty because she didn’t even want to go across. We panted, got beaten. But we had decided that we must do a good deed. You said that without helping an old woman across the street there would be no fruit. The old woman proved very strong. We were deluded in thinking she was so old, she was very powerful – and she screamed and shouted and struck us, but we did it. Until we had brought her over to this side, we didn’t leave, once done we all escaped.\nService! You don’t yet have the heavenly reward. You don’t yet have being. Whatever you do in the name of service, will be doing something wrong. Your situation is as if you had not yet studied medical science and you go to serve patients. The same would happen, wouldn’t it? The patients will die. If you don’t go perhaps they will survive. Not everyone sick person dies, but if a doctor with no experience of medicine, goes to serve patients and starts giving out prescriptions and medicines they will die. They will survive the disease, but it will be difficult to survive the doctor.\nThe world has suffered much from servants. Do-gooders have caused much trouble. Remember the real experience has to happen in you first.\nRID YOURSELF OF GATHERING DISCIPLES, RENOUNCE TITLES AS GRAVEYARDS, DEBATE AS POISON.\nAnd don’t be caught up in the scramble for titles and degrees. In the world there are degrees. Someone is an M.A., or a B.A., a B.S.C, an L.L.B., an M.D., a Ph.D., a D. Lit., or a D. Phil. These are titles in the world. And in the world of sadhus titles are also current. Someone is a Mahant - high priest, someone is a Mandalacharya - teacher of the inner circle, someone is a Shankaracharya, someone is this, someone that. Someone writes the honorific Shree one hundred and five times, another writes it one hundred and eight times. Karpatri Maharaj has defeated everyone, he writes Anant Shree, meaning infinite unending Shrees. Now you cannot surpass him. Like a small child saying, I am one more than you. Whatever you say I am one more than that. Whoever makes this statement has won. Now whatever number you say, he is one more. Unending Shrees! Titles...\nYou are god. You have no need of any other title. All titles are small. What additional title does god need? Those who have known have declared your divinity. They have said you are the blessed bhagwan. You are the highest. There is nothing higher than you. Now will you write after The Blessed One, M.A.? L.L.B.? Ph.D.? You will look idiotic. All existence is filled with blessing.\nThis is why Gorakh says:\nRENOUNCE TITLES AS GRAVEYARDS...\nUnderstand titles as a graveyard. RENOUNCE... DEBATE AS POISON\nAnd don’t fall into useless debate and scriptural arguments. Renounce them as you would poison. HENCE I SAY, REALIZING DEATH...\nIf you don’t understand, if you don’t accept this, you will suffer much in the end. HENCE I SAY...\nHence I say it to you again and again.\n... REALIZING DEATH, O KING, REMAIN ALONE.\nThen you will be alone, will you not? Disciples will not be coming with you, titles will not come with you, nor wealth, nor position. You will go alone, know now that you are alone.\nHENCE I SAY, REALIZING DEATH...\nHence I say to remind you again and again, be now as you will be going in the end. Then death will take nothing from you. Then you will defeat death, death will not be able to defeat you.\n... O KING REMAIN ALONE.\nSEEING A GATHERING DON’T BOAST KNOWLEDGE\nPeople are very eager to find an opportunity to show their knowledge. If only someone asks anything, they have a chance to show their knowledge. This is a sign of ignorance.\nSEEING A GATHERING DON’T BOAST KNOWLEDGE\nWatching to see if anyone is ready to hear, if anyone makes the mistake of asking. Then the poor fellow is caught by his neck.\nImmediately grab hold of his neck. Immediately start dishing out your knowledge on him. Unless a seeker has come – one seeking moksha, liberation – remain quiet.\n... REMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND IGNORANT.\nUntil a true seeker comes, be a complete idiot, as if you can’t speak, a deaf-mute. Mad, be a madman, so that people don’t start to ask you on their own – why ask that madman?\nA journalist came to visit Gurdjieff. He came for an interview. Gurdjieff was drinking tea. He sat the journalist down next to him. Then Gurdjieff said to a disciple sitting nearby, what day is it today? The disciple said, today is Sunday. Gurdjieff banged his fist hard on the table and said, how can it be Sunday? Yesterday was Saturday. When the journalist heard this he was shocked out of his wits – what kind of man is this? He got so angry he banged the table with his fist saying how can it be Sunday? Who are you trying to befool? Who do you think you are? Yesterday was only Saturday, and today is Sunday? The journalist stood up. He said, good-by, I’ll be going now.\nWhen he left he looked quite ridiculous. Gurdjieff laughed. The disciples too were very happy. They said, you were outrageous! He said, what’s the use wasting time with this idiot? REMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND IGNORANT...\nGorakh says the same. He says just be insane if you see that some muddled, stinking, superfluous person... journalist etc... just be insane. He will go on his own and will never come back again.\nREMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND IGNORANT...\nAnd be completely ignorant. And those who know become totally ignorant. And those who know become totally mad. And those who know become total idiots, deaf-mutes – because there is no way to express what they have known. Kabir calls it “the deaf-mute’s sweet”. Like a deaf-mute who has tasted sweets! Those who know become totally mad because what they have known is so different from the underlying logic of this world that the logic of this world can take no part in it. They become just insane. Those who know become totally ignorant because they have found out that what they know is such that it cannot be communicated, even knowing it, it cannot be shared. The experience has happened, the taste is released, but it doesn’t form any idea.\nThis sigh of loving you – who can give news of it?\nAll acquainted with you become ignorant.\nHe says if I want to ask about you, whom can I ask? There are some who don’t know. They are ready to tell. But they don’t know. And there are some who know. But they are not ready to tell. They have become ignorant. What news can they give anyone?\nThis sigh of loving you – who can give news of it? All acquainted with you become ignorant.\nOne who has come to know, he himself goes beyond knowing. He has become completely ignorant.\nSocrates said at the time of his death, I know only one thing, that I don’t know anything. This is the sign of one who knows.\nDROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER...\nDrop any idea of being something. There are very strange thoughts moving here. One who is poor wants to be rich. And one who is rich thinks that the poor have more fun. This statement is very amazing:\nDROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER...\nThose who are commoners want to be kings, those who are kings think the common man enjoys more! The emperors think, if only I could get away from all this trouble, just take my guitar and roam from village to village. What ecstasy the wandering monk must have? He has a ragged quilt and he has the sky. Just beg a couple of crusts and sleep without cares. Drink water from a stream, and sleep beneath a tree. What fun that must be!\nThose who are kings think a beggar is in great joy. And beggars think, I am defeated, how long am I going to lie here under this tree, will I never put a roof over my head? Will I never have butter to spread on my bread? When will I acquire a throne or even a cushion?\nHere all are suffering. One who has thinks, those who don’t have are in bliss. One who doesn’t have thinks those who have are in bliss. Gorakh says, let go of both. Wherever you are, however you are is good. Don’t hope for the future.\n... EAT BY BEGGING, REMAIN ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT.\nWhat you receive, whatever god has given you, alms... What god has given you, hold in the highest peacefulness. And let go of all hopes. Don’t take the meaning of UDAAS, beyond hope, to mean that you are beyond any hope, that you are sitting crying, that flies are buzzing around, that you are just wasting time killing flies. Gorakh cannot say this because Gorakh says:\nLAUGHING, PLAYING, THE KNACK OF MEDITATION. LAUGH, PLAY, ENJOY COLOR...\nGorakh could not give that meaning to beyond hope. Someone else might do that. Gorakh’s UDAAS, beyond hope, has another meaning. Ud + aas, over + hope, one who has let go of hope, one who has gone beyond hope. One who has no hope of the future. Who doesn’t say I will enjoy tomorrow, when such and such happens. One who is enjoying right now. One who says, who cares whether tomorrow comes or not. Has tomorrow ever come? I enjoy right now.\nLAUGH, PLAY, ENJOY COLOR...\nOne who is immersed in color and joy right now. One who’s festival of spring is now. One whose festival of lights is now. One who doesn’t wait for some other time to celebrate the festival of lights.\nBeyond hope means one who has let go of any kind of hope for the future.\nDROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER, EAT BY BEGGING, REMAIN ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT.\nLET GO OF POTIONS, MAGIC BREWS, ALCHEMY...\nDrop alchemical elixirs. People have been doing this business for hundreds of years. Someone makes a ‘philosopher’s’ elixir, saying with this elixir iron changes to gold. Or if a mortal man drinks it he will become immortal. Drop all this.\nLET GO OF POTIONS, MAGIC BREWS, ALCHEMY, RENOUNCING RIDDHI, MIRACLE POWERS, RECEIVE SIDDHI, THE POWER OF FULFILLMENT.\nLet go of powers, only then will you receive power, will you attain realization. There is a beautiful difference between powers and power. Powers means: I can do miracles, I receive nectar, I can change iron to gold, I can fly in the sky, I can walk through walls. These are powers. If you drop all of these you will find power. Power is one. The meaning of power is, totally merge into what is hidden within. There is no need to fly in the sky, nor any need to walk through walls. The door is sufficient. And birds go on flying in the sky – none of them has become awakened. And if you really have your heart set on it, there are airplanes. Sit in one.\nA man came to Ramakrishna and said I can walk on water, what can you do? Ramakrishna said, you really can walk on water? How much time did it take for you to learn this art?\nHe said, it took eighteen years. Ramakrishna started laughing. He said, idiot of idiots! I give two cents to go across the river. You took eighteen years to walk across water? What’s the use? Go and walk on water, keep on walking. You really can walk on water, can’t you? Just give two cents to sit in a boat and you can go across. For this two cent crossing you wasted eighteen years?\nGorakh says, drop this kind of things. These are all new ways for the ego. DROP DRINKING WINE AND TAKING DRUGS...\nDrop intoxicants. Intoxicants give you a false meditation. For centuries sadhus have been taking drugs, making drinks of bhang hemp and smoking marijuana. From the soma drink of the Vedas till\nthe present. Now LSD is made in America, it is a new scientific form of soma. From the seers of the Vedas through Timothy Leary and Aldous Huxley the hope continues that samadhi might happen through taking drugs. Samadhi does not happen through taking drugs – a counterfeit samadhi arises. Were it so cheap, to just take a drug and samadhi happens... Yes, if you smoke marijuana, drink bhang, drink wine, a little joy will come, because the worries of life can be forgotten for a little while. But the worries are waiting in their place. When you come down they will be back, in double potency.\nDROP DRINKING WINE AND TAKING DRUGS, THEY CREATE ALL SORTS OF DREAMS AND IMAGINATIONS.\nMany types of fantasy and dream are born inside you under the influence of all of these. NARI, MYNA, SARANGI...\nLet go of sexual desire. If you are a man drop the idea that you will receive something from a woman. If you are a woman drop the idea that you will receive something from a man.\nNARI, MYNA...\nSadhus go on training myna birds. Many sadhus are doing this business of preparing a myna and having them choose cards. Sadhus are opening people’s fate. They read palms. They foretell the future. They examine astrology charts. Drop all this meaningless nonsense.\nSARANGI is an Indian violin. There are some who engage in this business. They think it is enough, if the sarangi is played, all is played. If the sarangi is played all has come. When will you play the inner sarangi? Are you just going to go on playing on the outer one? Are you going to beat only the outer drum, when will the inner dance begin? This is why Gorakh says drop all outer distractions.\n... THE SATGURU SAYS DROP ALL THREE.\nThe satgurus, the true masters, say let go of all three of these. COMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT...\nWhat can you do? COMMENCE the inner journey.\nVESSEL. Get acquainted with the temple. Decorate the temple. Clean it. Purify it.\nRECOGNITION. Recognize being. Who is enthroned within you? Who is this consciousness? Who am I? Raise the\nwho am I in your depth of depths. This one is the only real.\nAnd the day recognition happens is the day you can claim the ATTAINMENT. When the attainment comes, the consummation comes, your liberation comes.\nSHREE GORAKH-YATI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.\nGorakh says, O emperor! I want to give you the one message of awakening. I want to give you the one remembrance. Awake! This awakening is within your capacity. It is your potential. Just as a tree is hidden in the seed, in the same way god is hidden in you.\nBesides placement in line what will be gained in the end? I have never seen a drop that won’t become the ocean.\nYou are a drop. You can be the ocean. The ocean is hidden in the drop. And until you become the ocean, don’t accept relief, do not relax. Let that thirst take hold of you like a flaming fire. And all will be reduced to ash. And all will be burnt up. And all will be destroyed. Then higher life is uncovered.\nDIE, O YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.\nEnough for today?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"15264","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/>Death is Divine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 Thought of memory-intelligence</h1><div class=post-meta>72 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;15264 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Death_is_Divine/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

never seen a drop that won’t become the ocean.</p><p>There is no drop in existence that won’t become the ocean one day or
another. The part becomes the whole. The fragment becomes the
unfragmented. The finite becomes the infinite. There is not a single
drop whose destiny is not to become the ocean. Then how can there be a
single man that will remain deprived of becoming god?</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming god is man’s nature. Just as a drop can become the ocean, if
man becomes free of limitations he can become god. Man is god, it is
only a matter of letting limitations drop. There is no other barrier to
man’s becoming god. We have drawn a Lakshman line, a magic circle, all
around us. It is a line drawn by us. We never go out of that circle. We
have made a wall. We have made a security arrangement. We have become
imprisoned in the known. The unknown is calling, but because of fear we
haven’t been able to start off on the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey of yoga, of union, is an unknown journey. But only one
who has become tired of the known will go on an unknown journey. Has
what you have known fulfilled your heart?</p><p><br></p><p>If the heart is fulfilled then no going towards god arises. You have
attained god. The very meaning of fulfilling the heart is union with
god. Your heart is not fulfilled. Your heart is not fulfilled at all. It
remains as empty as ever. Only hopes – tomorrow it will be fulfilled,
day after tomorrow it will be fulfilled – go on entangling you. Only
false promises that will never be fulfilled. No ones promises have ever
been fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday I was listening to a popular song</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows what kind of people they were whose love found love</p><p><br></p><p>There have never been people whose love has found love. In this world
none have ever attained satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows what kind of people they were, whose love found love When I
asked for budding flowers, I got a garland of thorns</p><p>When I sought the goal of happiness, I received the dust of misery
When I wanted songs of affection, I received cold sighs</p><p>This consolation I received - the heart’s oppression doubled Each
friend gave a moment or two of friendship and parted Who has time to
hold the hand of the mad?</p><p>Often I am troubled even by my own shadow</p><p>If this is called living, I will live just like this</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t cry out, but sew my lips together, and drink back my tears
How can misery upset me now? Misery I’ve had a hundred times Who knows
what kind of people they were whose love found love When I asked for
budding flowers, I got a garland of thorns</p><p>Such people have never existed. Here whoever has asked for budding
flowers has been defeated by thorns. In this world there is nothing but
thorns. Yes, from afar they appear to be flowers, coming nearer they
prove to be thorns. What you don’t have appears lovely, what you have
has become worthless. There is attraction for the absent. ‘The distant
drum sounds pleasing.’</p><p><br></p><p>Only those will start on a journey of yoga, of union, who are
completely clear that it is not possible to attain happiness here.
Happiness is impossible in the world, because the world means the
outward journey – going out of oneself. And going out of oneself no one
can ever attain happiness. The further you go from yourself the more you
become opposed to your nature. And to dissolve in your nature is
happiness. To become submerged in oneself is happiness. Nature is
happiness, unnature is misery.</p><p><br></p><p>So the further you go from yourself – in wealth, in power, in
prestige – the more you go on becoming miserable. The world does not
mean these trees, these stars and moon. The world means the fleeing
outward away from the heart. The outward journey is the world. The
inward journey is religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Look with close attention at your life a little. Think about it, then
only can these eternal words of Gorakh be understood. And why only
Gorakh? No words of any awakened one will be of any use to you if you
have not examined your own life. Still you go on hoping. Your hopes have
still not been demolished.</p><p><br></p><p>The ocean of the world is absolutely fake Look, not even a lip is
moist.</p><p>It appears that water is rippling, but appears so only from afar. It
is a mirage. When you go near, not even the lips can be moistened. Water
reaching the throat is out of the, not even the lips are moistened.</p><p><br></p><p>Green does not even exist in this region</p><p><br></p><p>O Majnu are you sowing seeds of desire in your heart?</p><p><br></p><p>On this land greenery has never existed. You are uselessly planting
seeds of wanting in your heart. You will repent much. These seeds never
sprout.</p><p><br></p><p>Green does not even exist in this region</p><p>O Majnu are you sowing seeds of desire in your heart?</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you go on planting seed of new desires? The old seeds never
came up but you sow new seed. You have been doing this for life after
life.</p><p><br></p><p>I came right in but not a drop in my hands Water far off in showy
mirage.</p><p>O Shiva! Real gold assay color is not on the stone, You know blue
fills that other sky.</p><p>Here presence is absence, and absence is presence, You speak truly,
no one hears.</p><p>Much entanglement of this world, in presence an absence, what exists
is forgotten. What exists is not seen.</p><p><br></p><p>Here presence is absence, and absence is presence,</p><p><br></p><p>And our emotions remain entangled in what is not. You are stuck on
what you do not have. You will be surprised knowing this.</p><p><br></p><p>People think that they are hung up on what they have. This is wrong.
You are not even a little stuck on what you have, you are stuck on what
you don’t have. If you have ten thousand rupees you are not hung up
there. You are stuck on the ten million that you don’t have. Even if you
drop this ten thousand it will not help. Until the ten million drops
that you don’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>It feels very absurd that we are entangled in what is not. You are
not entangled with the wife you have. You have long been free of her.
You have stopped even looking at her. You can’t even recognize her. How
many days has it been, how many years, since you took an eyeful of your
wife? Who looks at ones wife? People look at others’ wives.</p><p><br></p><p>You are hung up on what is not near. The absent has entangled you.
This is why the master’s job is very difficult to work out. He has to
take away from you what you don’t have. And he gives you what you have.
If you go near you won’t find even a drop there, where it seemed an
ocean was pounding.</p><p><br></p><p>This deception is like the sky’s blue appearance. It just appears so.
The sky has no color. The sky is not a thing that can be colored. The
sky is the essence of emptiness. How can you color emptiness? The sky
only looks blue.</p><p><br></p><p>O Shiva! Real gold assay color is not on the stone, You know blue
fills that other sky.</p><p>It is definitely proven, now there is scientific proof that the sky
has no color, nevertheless it appears blue. And when you are out on a
desert wasting with thirst, your thirst gives birth to mirages. And</p><p>not only ordinary men, extra-ordinary men also fall for mirages. Even
Rama went chasing after a golden deer. Do gold deer exist? Have they
ever?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a lovely story. Rama allowed Sita to be lost – not because of
Ravana, but because he started chasing a golden deer. If you ask me, it
is secondary that Ravana kidnapped Sita. Rama’s squandering Sita is the
important thing. Think a little, if it were you, you would have thought,
do gold deer exist? Have they ever? But a gold deer appeared and Rama
pursued it. He picked up his bow and arrow and then abandoned Sita. He
deserted what is for what is not and never was and what never can be.
Completely against intelligence, against thought, against understanding
– he went after the gold deer.</p><p><br></p><p>But the story is beautiful. We all go searching for golden deer in
just the same way and lose our Sita’s. Sita is your soul, what you have.
You have forgotten that. You have turned your back on that. Go in search
of a gold deer – fame and position, wealth, respect, honor. These are
all gold deer - that have never existed and never will.</p><p><br></p><p>My existence is like a bubble, This whole spectacle is like wine.</p><p>Open the eye of the heart to that world, Where status is like a
dream.</p><p>Just open your heart a little to that “other world”, because
everything here is dream like. Open the eye of the heart to that
world,</p><p>Open the eye of the heart to that truth, push aside the veil, raise
the curtain. Where status is like a dream.</p><p>Power here in this world is not more than a dream. My existence is
like a bubble,</p><p>An existence like a bubble, a soap bubble, here one moment, gone the
next. This whole spectacle is like wine.</p><p>This whole mirage-like production goes on, falsely – just because we
believe in it.</p><p><br></p><p>And what will people not believe! Our whole world is made of beliefs.
We believe. The whole thing is belief. And we believe in it so it goes
on moving. Those who don’t share this belief will laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>For the man who runs after money, money is truth. And one who doesn’t
run after money, will laugh saying you are mad. What will money do? What
will happen with money? It remains behind all the</p><p>same. One who doesn’t have the belief will be very surprised at what
you are running after. But one whose belief it is, his eyes are
intoxicated. He is not in his senses.</p><p><br></p><p>This world is the result of our desiring, our wanting, our running,
our ambition. And one who doesn’t immediately wake up from this ambition
will never recognize himself. There is no happiness without knowing
oneself. There is no music without knowing oneself. There is no taste of
the eternal nectar without knowing oneself. These sutras are for this
search for the eternal nectar.</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN O EMPEROR, TO THOUGHTS OF PURE INTELLIGENCE</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, O EMPEROR! He is calling you an emperor, remember,
because you are an emperor, only you believe you are a beggar. You are
the master, you believe you are a slave. You believe, so you have become
a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN O EMPEROR, TO THOUGHTS OF PURE INTELLIGENCE</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to a few words of understanding, of awareness. Or will you go
on running, go on escaping? Won’t you stop? Won’t you stop and think a
little that you have run much, and where have you reached? Just look
back at it once again.</p><p><br></p><p>... THIS DREAM WORLD ARISES FROM FIVE ELEMENTS</p><p><br></p><p>Those things that you are running after, there is nothing there, just
the play of the five elements. Earth, water, air, fire, ether – this
whole play is created from them. There is nothing in this play. And what
you are searching for is present inside of you. That which is beyond the
five elements is present within you. These five elements are made and
disappear. They fall and rise, they are waves. With them you can never
become ecstatic, before they are fully made they start disappearing. How
can your life be with them? They are momentary. And you get misery from
what is momentary. Search a little for what is eternal. And that is
sitting inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look carefully at this world then the remembrance that you are
the observer starts coming. And if you look at it unconsciously then the
observer is just forgotten. You are caught up in the seen. One who is
caught up in the seen has gone astray. And one who is awakened in the
seer has arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>COMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT,</p><p><br></p><p>SHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, O emperor, I have four things to tell to you. Gorakh
pours his entire life’s thinking into these four things.</p><p><br></p><p>COMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT</p><p><br></p><p>Four things: the first is commencement, inception, start, beginning.
Commencement means until now you are running outwardly, you have not
even commenced the inner journey. You have not turned your gaze
backwards. You have not looked back. What Mahavira calls pratikraman,
returning back.</p><p>The mind has two states - aakraman, violence... Aakraman means
outward, pratikraman means inward. Aakraman is to the other, pratikraman
is to oneself. Or what Patanjali has called pratyahar – turning in.</p><p><br></p><p>Return, return to yourself. This is what Jesus has called conversion.
Conversion does not mean that a Hindu becomes a Christian, or a
Christian becomes a Hindu. Is this conversion? Conversion means outer
journey converted to inner journey. Don’t search for the temple outside,
search within. You don’t go to the outer bathing shrines, you take an
inner bath. You take a dip in meditation, and life transformation
begins. This transformation Gorakh calls commencement. Only then do you
begin to be human. Animals live outwardly, plants also. Man is the only
one on this earth who can life inwardly. Only he has the potential that
can witness the inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>All run outwardly, there is nothing special in this. Dignity begins
in your life the day you start returning inward. You become glorious.
You become majestic. You become dignified. You become human. The inner
birth of your being has happened. The quest for the divine has begun
inside of you. And this is the greatest revolution. No other revolution
is so great. It is inner revolution. This Gorakh calls this
commencement.</p><p><br></p><p>He says, listen O Emperor! You have not even commenced your empire.
You have not swung the first stroke of your pick axe to start excavating
the mine of wealth you are master of.</p><p><br></p><p>The second: vessel. Vessel means clay pot. This is the body, the
vessel of clay. This vessel is a temple. Within it the master is hidden.
Inside this pot the sky is hidden. Do not get entangled with the outer
pot because when you turn inward you will find that the body is not as
small as you understood. The body is very mysterious. The body is a
universe unto itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say that in each body there are at least seventy million
cells. This is why we call the being purush – master of the city –
because the body is a city, a well populated city. Bombay is smaller.
Calcutta is also smaller. The population of Calcutta is ten million, the
population of your body is fifty million, fifty million cells. Your body
is created by fifty million cells living together.</p><p><br></p><p>This is no small event. Don’t be deceived looking at the small
boundary of the body. Now you know that scientists have discovered
atomic power. An atom, which cannot be seen by the eye. But if the atom
is exploded, then in ninety seconds Hiroshima, with a population of one
hundred thousand, is reduced to ash. Such a vast energy can be hidden in
what cannot be seen by the naked eye. Then the body is very big. A very
vast energy is hidden with in. It has great secrets.</p><p><br></p><p>If you turn inward the first thing you will discover is the body. The
body is a temple. If you go into the temple, then first you will climb
the temple steps, you will pass through the temple walls, you will enter
the door, then you can reach the inner shrine, the inner home. Hence,
first begin the inner journey, then you will become familiar with this
home. Otherwise meeting the inner master will not be possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally do not go against this body. Don’t start torturing it.
Otherwise you will not be able to understand. This is god’s very loving
gift. Do not suppress, do not torture, do not harass. To suppress,
torture, harass it is a denial of god, it is atheistic.</p><p>A believer gives thanks to the divine saying what a lovely body you
have given. From earth such a form has been fashioned! Such magic with
just five elements. God is a magician. His magic is the greatest... the
greatest proof, if any is possible, is your body.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say so much work happens in the body, if we have to do all
this in a factory, then its noise will be heard four miles away. We have
not yet discovered how. Science has advanced very far. It has put man on
the moon. It has exploded atomic bombs. And now we have produced so many
atom bombs that we can reduce the entire planet to ash, not just once
but a thousand times. In spite of this great advance in science, science
has not yet been able to convert a single piece of bread into blood.
Converting bread into blood is still not possible. This miracle happens
in your body. And not just that it makes blood from bread, it makes
flesh. Bread also makes your brain. Bread also makes your thoughts. And
through some unknown door bread ignites your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said, “When hungry, no singing praises of Krishna Gopala.” A
hungry man cannot pray. A hungry man does not have the energy necessary
for singing prayers, for bhajan. A full belly is needed for prayer song.
Hence, in a country that becomes poor bhajan disappears or becomes
false. In this country bhajan was once true, because the the country was
rich. At least people were receiving their daily bread, no one was dying
of starvation. In those days Buddha was born, Mahavira was born, Gorakh
was born, Patanjali and Krishna... and we were at great heights. At
least people were not starving. They were wealthy, not that I am saying
that they had a great heap of wealth, this I am not saying. But they
were not hungry. The body was satisfied. Bhajan could arise.</p><p><br></p><p>When a country is poor, then communism arises there, not religion.
Then people become ready for death and dying. Then there is cornering
and pressing demands on authorities, there are strikes, riots, murders
and violence. Then bhajan does not arise. A starving man can do
violence, not love. A starving man is angry, a starving man cannot be
compassionate.</p><p><br></p><p>I say unto you, if this country remains poor a long time – as the
leaders of this country have decided it will remain poor – if this
country remains long poor, then no possibility except communism will
remain. Knowingly or unknowingly this country is being taken towards
communism. Perhaps those who are taking it do not know this, they are
unaware of it. Perhaps their efforts are that the country not become
communist. But it is not a of your efforts, if the country remains poor,
then nothing is possible except communism. Bhajan cannot be born.</p><p><br></p><p>Act quickly! This country’s poverty, this country’s starvation must
be destroyed. Otherwise it will fall into a great ditch which it will be
hard to get out of. Getting free of the slavery of the English was not
as difficult. If this country should become communist, then breaking
these chains of bondage will be impossible, almost impossible. If a
country like Russia cannot break them then we will not be able to break
out. We have easily become enslaved and we have readily remained
enslaved for thousands of years. And communism is a terrible slavery.
Yes, bread will be available and being will be taken away. But
purchasing bread at this price is great slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>Bread can be made. A little understanding is necessary. Making bread
is not difficult. But our foolishness is so ancient that the reasons why
we are poor are the same reasons we go on increasing. And we are enemies
of the methods that can destroy poverty .</p><p><br></p><p>This is the reason behind Indira’s defeat, the whole cause is that
she made great efforts that somehow the population of the country be
controlled. Without this the country can never become</p><p>rich. Becoming rich is far away, it cannot even get a full belly.
This is the reason for her defeat. The reason for Indira’s defeat, in
total, was that she tried in every way to impose compulsory family
planning onto this country. Only if family planning is imposed can this
country be saved from poverty. The population has become six hundred
million. As this century draws to a close, the population will become
one billion. We do not have the capacity that we can fill the stomachs
of one billion people. People will get hungrier every day. And the
hungrier they get the more enraged they will be. And the more enraged,
the more communist they will become. By themselves! This is an
inevitable process.</p><p><br></p><p>Indira was defeated because she made real effort to do the right job.
And that job is such that it has to be done by force, otherwise it will
not happen. If you leave people to themselves, they will not be ready to
accept it. People don’t care, people are not aware. They say, god gives
children, who are we to stop them? They will go on producing children –
go on producing children like rabbits. And the country will go on
getting poorer every day. They do not know what they are doing. It will
have to be forcibly stopped, only then can it stop, otherwise it will
not stop.</p><p><br></p><p>It has to be stopped with compulsion. People will be upset, because
their ancient habits are being interfered with. A man whose only joy is
to have as many children as possible, if he is stopped and told two or
three only, he will become angry, because his father produced twelve
children and he is limited to two or three. In his family tradition such
a thing has never happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindu pandits and priests are angry, Muslim priests and scholars are
also angry, because their share might decrease. Their concern is that
Muslim population not decrease. Their concern is that Hindu population
not decrease. The Jainas are concerned that Jainas do not decrease. If
their numbers decrease then their power will decrease. No one is
concerned that if you all increase your numbers, Muslims increase,
Hindus increase, Jainas increase, this whole country will die.</p><p><br></p><p>All these priests and scholars, joined together and supported
Indira’s defeat. This is not accidental. If Indira did any wrong it is
only one: that she tried to do the right thing, which this country’s
convention- bound mind-set did not like. You defeated Indira and
installed senile old people, in whom there is no hope, who have no
ability, with whom the country can have no future. But all joined
together, all reactionaries and retrogressive elements. The whole
stupidity of this country joined together.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see what a miracle it was? All political parties, whose
principles have nothing in common, whose channels of thought have
nothing in common, all were ready to gather together. Such opportunism
you will never find in the world, where their principles, all their
philosophies, all their great ideas were put aside in one moment for
political power. It is amazing that Socialists, Congress party, and the
right wing Jana Sangha all joined together. But also not amazing,
because Muslims, Hindus all ancient voices, all conservatives put the
pressure on.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if this country decided to remain poor. If it is to remain
poor, there is no possibility of bhajan, of singing prayers arising.</p><p><br></p><p>What is true for the individual, is also true for the society, is
also true for the country and true also for all of mankind. Your body
should be joyous, should be delighted, should be healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>So the second task of a yogi is to keep the body happy, healthy,
blossoming. The body is like a flower. It is smiling. It is filled with
joy. This temple is the lord’s, it should be decorated with garlands and
wreaths.</p><p>But your so called sadhus and sannyasins go on teaching you the
reverse. They have given poison. They have taught that the body is the
enemy. If you are to achieve god then you must destroy the body, torture
it, let it decay, place it on a bed of thorns. Beat the body. The more
you beat it, the closer you reach to god.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a lie. This is one hundred per cent false. The more you
destroy the body, the lower the temple will fall. And if the temple
falls, there is the fear that the idol too will go down. This is a
temple. It needs to be respected. In Gorakh’s opinion there is great
respect for the body. Hence he says: first begin the inner journey, then
take care of the temple.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing is vessel. First is commencement. Vessel – then take
care of this temple. He is hidden somewhere in it, his treasure is
hidden. All of the methods of yoga are to take care of it. Restraint,
rules, breathing, withdrawal of senses... These are not to destroy the
body. They are to protect the body. These are for the beauty, the
health, the energy of the body. The body will be delighted from these.
Flowers will bloom in it. By means of these the roots of the body will
deeply enter the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing is recognition. When your body becomes beautiful,
full of music, rhythmical, when there is poetic meter in your body, a
joyful madness, then you will recognize consciousness with
consciousness. Then you will receive the first glimpse of the one who is
hidden within this body. You will enter the temple. Unhappy, crying,
hungry you cannot enter into it. It can happen only mounted on the a
wave of health.</p><p><br></p><p>COMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT</p><p><br></p><p>When recognition has happened, then decision – then attainment.
Before this do not say that god exists or not. Before this do not say
that nirvana exists or not. Before this do not make any conclusions,
neither yes nor no, neither a believer nor an atheist. Any conclusions
made before this are not based on your own experience. They are
borrowed, they stink, they are given by others. Who knows if they have
given them correctly or incorrectly. Who knows if the others are
deceiving? Who knows if they themselves are deceived, even if they are
not trying to deceive you? Who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>Man should remember, I will trust only in my own knowledge. I will be
my own source. I will become my own lamp. Then decide. This is a very
lovely idea. First the inner journey, then right care of the body, then
the experience of consciousness, meditation, then the attainment of
samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>SHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.</p><p><br></p><p>And Gorakh says, if you do this much then you will become conscious
that you are an emperor. The master of masters is sitting inside of you.
The lord of lords is sitting inside of you. But you go on running. You
don’t know where – where are you running? – except for where you are,
you are running everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story, that when god first created the world he lived
right here in the middle of the market, on Mahatma Gandhi Road.
Naturally, he had made the world, so he lived in the world. But people
started bothering him too much. Complaining and complaining. This is not
right, that is not right. And the complaints were so contradictory that
even if one wanted to fulfill them it couldn’t be</p><p>done. Someone says don’t let it rain tomorrow because I am dying some
clothes and they have to dry. Someone else says let it rain tomorrow
because we have planted seeds, they shouldn’t dry out. One says let the
sun come out tomorrow, another says don’t let the sun come tomorrow
because I am going on a trip, it is better if there is shade. God must
have started going crazy. Whose suggestion should he follow? If one is
done, many cannot be done. If one is done, the other one is denied. He
started getting frightened. People wouldn’t let him sleep either day or
night. In the middle of the night they would come and knock at the door
saying do it this way, do it that way, tomorrow morning don’t let the
sun out at all, tomorrow let the sun shine early because I have to work
in the fields, it is difficult in the dark.</p><p><br></p><p>He called the gods, called his viziers, saying tell me some way out,
I will go mad. Where can I hide? Save me from my people. I made them,
now they are making it difficult for me. I made a mistake when I made
man.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why, you know, that after man god did not make anything more.
Awareness dawned, he got smart. Before man he had created much: plants,
birds and beasts, mountains and rivers, moon and stars, then man. And he
made man, then made nothing more. Millions of years have passed since
then, god has been sitting with his hands completely still, not making a
thing. This mistake is such that his courage has broken to go beyond
it.</p><p><br></p><p>So he said I am not going to make anything. But what is made is made.
Where can I hide? Someone said, hide in the Himalayas, on Mount Everest.
He said, very soon - you may not know it - after a few moments have
passed Hillary and Tenzing will climb Everest. And once they reach then
busses will come and hotels will be made and Mahatma Gandhi Road...
People will start coming by helicopter. You don’t know, after just a few
days. That place will be no solution.</p><p><br></p><p>So someone said, on the moon... So He said, that won’t work either.
Soon Armstrong will reach there. And then the Russians will reach and
troubles will start. Then an old god came and said something into his
ear and He was happy. He said, this is right, this fits. The old one
said, try this, hide inside of man. Man will go off to the moon and
stars, but he will never go within. He will never remember.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then god has been hiding within you and in great joy. Only once
in a while a Gorakh-yeti reaches. But by then all his complaints have
dropped. So god is simply delighted to see him. Meeting him He just
dances. Not just any fool can reach there. They don’t have time with all
their trips to Delhi. Some Gorakh-yeti, some Gautam Buddha, some
Vardhaman Mahavira... but sitting with such people He too is delighted.
In their company he is happy. The gathering comes together, round after
round of honey. The juiciest things must have been said, or songs must
have been sung, or dance, or drums beaten, or the strings of the veena
played.</p><p><br></p><p>But god is within you. You are god.</p><p><br></p><p>SHREE GORAKH-YETI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go within, take a little awareness, complete these four
things, receive the attainment, receive the goal of life, the meaning of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>TO BEGIN, DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO...</p><p>And if you want to begin this journey then you will have to drop sex.
Sex means without others I cannot go on. The other is absolutely needed.
If you are a woman a man is needed, if you are a man a woman is needed.
The other is needed, the opposite is needed. And the opposite is outside
so man are running after women, women are running after men.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming free of sex means: first I will find out: Who am I? In
reality do I need the other or not? I still don’t know who I am, but I
am seeking the other! One who becomes acquainted with himself is
surprised, the other is not needed at all. One’s own being is
sufficient.</p><p><br></p><p>... DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO...</p><p><br></p><p>And one who has thrown sex, one who has no need of the other, from
him anger drops by itself. Anger is the shadow of sex. Only a sexual
person can be angry. Why? Because if someone creates a barrier between
him and his desiring, him and what he desires, then anger arises. How
can you make someone angry if he has no sexual desire? No matter what
obstacle you put, he has no desire. There is no suffering from your
obstacle. Your obstacle does not appear to be an obstacle.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has said, “If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer him the
other. And if someone takes your coat, offer him your shirt. And if
someone asks you to carry his burden one mile, take it two miles.”</p><p><br></p><p>One who has no desires, won’t have any problem. One who has no need
of the other, cannot be disturbed by the other. This is something to be
understood. Others can disturb you as long as you need them. Hence great
disturbance arises. The husband needs the wife, hence the wife can
disturb. The wife needs the husband, hence the husband can disturb. This
is why lovers love each other and remain angry with each other and even
fight and quarrel. Why? The one we are dependent on – this dependence
brings trouble because our key is in their hand. We do not remain our
own master.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence lovers go on fighting over who is boss, me or you? After
marriage husband and wife have a single struggle, who is really the
boss? They don’t say this openly... it cannot be said openly. They make
political claims. It doesn’t have to be said. The wife makes her moves.
The husband makes his. Both of them place their own pieces on the board
- who is the boss? From any excuse it has to be proven who is the boss.
If the wife says something, the husband opposes it whether it is
something to be opposed or not. If the husband says something the wife
has to oppose it. Trivial things like which movie to go see and there is
an argument.</p><p><br></p><p>One day their was a great argument between Mulla Nasruddin and his
wife. For an hour, an hour and a half there was a very heated exchange.
Then Mulla went outside. His condition was as if he had been beaten. He
slipped out. He walked around in the cool air, the mind become a little
quiet. It was a small matter – which film to go to? He thought, what is
there in this small matter? Its okay let’s do what she want’s. He became
a little aware. Why quarrel? And quarreling will be expensive. Now
hunger is starting to arise. Now she will not cook any food. I will have
to sleep at night, now she will not allow sleep. She will throw pillows.
Upside down or right side up she will provoke some disturbance, or turn
the radio up too loud. Quarrels are not so easy, they cannot be patched
up so easy. When you start a disturbance it will go on continuing.
Thinking over and understanding everything, carefully calculating he
said to himself, It is better that we go see the film that she says is
good to see. He came inside and said, “Be happy, I will do what you
want, I accept what you want. Lets go see the film you want to see.”</p><p>His wife looked at him and said, “But now I have changed my mind.
Agreeing to that means nothing now. I don’t want to see that film.”</p><p><br></p><p>If the intention is to quarrel it makes no difference. It is an
excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>But lovers quarrel, psychologists say that the fundamental reason is
that as soon as you fall in love you begin to understand that your
happiness is dependent on someone else. The other will give when they
give. If the other withdraws, then they withdraw. You do not remain your
own master. You have become a slave. There is suffering from
enslavement. From suffering, anger arises; from anger, struggle.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex and anger go together. And where there is sex and anger, in the
middle between them ego arises. If you are victorious over others, then
ego becomes strong. If you are defeated by the other, the ego becomes
hidden, goes beneath the surface of the earth. Another path is found to
defeat someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>One who has no desire, nor any anger, his ego dissolves by itself.
Sex and anger are the two wings which fly the bird of ego.</p><p><br></p><p>TO BEGIN, DROP SEX, ANGER, EGO, DREAMS OF THE MIND AND IMPURITIES OF
INDULGENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the idea that something can be received from outside. No one has
ever received or ever will receive anything. The more you ask, the more
you are troubled, the more you are sad.</p><p><br></p><p>I longed for the moon and stars</p><p><br></p><p>I got nothing but the black ink of night</p><p><br></p><p>I am that poem that did not find love’s gathering, I am that
traveller who arrived at no destination, wounds I have received, I
longed for springtime I longed for the moon and stars</p><p>No curling locks, no skirt’s hem to comfort me Not even faded stars
cross my path</p><p>My eyes longed for the sights</p><p><br></p><p>I longed for the moon and stars</p><p>Useless desires came to reside in my heart I set out to bring light
and got darkness</p><p>I longed for the streaming of color and light I longed for the moon
and stars</p><p>I got nothing but the black ink of night</p><p><br></p><p>No one has ever received anything else – they received the black ink
of night. Ask for moon and stars, you are are free to ask. But nothing
happens according to your request. Through your asking you have become a
beggar. Through your becoming a beggar your value has dropped. You have
become scattered around, far from god. Become a master. If you are to
meet that master, then become a master. Only a master can meet a master.
There is a meeting of like qualities. Becoming a beggar you cannot meet
god. Only becoming a master can you meet. Only becoming like him will
you be able to meet.</p><p><br></p><p>What does it mean to become a master? That no desiring remains - not
for maya, not for sex, not for greed, not for wealth, not for power, no
desire remains. You have said: I accept all as you have made me. I
accept myself as I am. Just as I am, I accept completely. In such a
state an emperor is born inside of you. Then even if you are a beggar
you have an emperor. Now even if you are an emperor it is only in name,
inside you are only a beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>... DREAMS OF THE MIND AND IMPURITIES OF INDULGENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>RENOUNCE WORLDLY CRAVINGS, DROP GREED, THEY CATCH THE SWAN AND KILL
IT.</p><p><br></p><p>All these dreams will gang up, grab your soul and murder it. Inside
you they will wring the neck of the swan.</p><p><br></p><p>RENOUNCE WORLDLY CRAVINGS, DROP GREED, THEY CATCH THE SWAN AND KILL
IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this misery. Drop this greed. These have murdered you. You have
been finished by their poison.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP THE DUAL, REMAIN NON-DUAL</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this language of two. Drop the language of I and you. Become
non-dual. Where you is gone, the desire for you is gone, there I also
goes. Then a silence remains. Silence - as is seen after a storm. Or
silence - as comes before a storm. Or silence - if you understand then
it is also in the center of the storm. If you are aware there is silence
in the market too. There is always silence within. There it is eternal
peace. If you learn to take a dip within the outer noise cannot shatter
it, no outer barrier will be a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP THE DUAL, REMAIN NON-DUAL, RENOUNCE EMBRACING, REMAIN
UNBOUND,</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this embrace of others, because you become bound by this
embrace. Your life has become a prison because of others. Through others
life has become enchained. It is a barrier of others into which you have
fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>... RENOUNCE EMBRACING, REMAIN UNBOUND</p><p>Do you want to be liberated? Do you want to be free? Do you want the
infinity and freedom of the sky? Then you will have to learn to be
non-dual.</p><p><br></p><p>NATURALNESS IS TECHNIQUE, ASANA HAPPENS...</p><p><br></p><p>Learn the natural, spontaneous spiritual practice. NATURALNESS IS
TECHNIQUE! This is the real union. What is the natural practice? Not
wanting to be anything. From wanting to be, from the desire to be
something, man becomes unnatural. When you want to be something, then an
ideal comes in front of you - to be this.</p><p><br></p><p>Assume you wanted to become Buddha, what will you do? If you want to
be Buddha, you start imitating Buddha. You will forget who you are. You
will start behaving like Buddha. If you want to be a Mahavira, you will
stand naked like Mahavira. This is not your own. If you want to be
something, if some ideal enters your life, you become false.</p><p><br></p><p>With ideals comes hypocrisy. An ideal means in the future there is a
star like I want to be - like Mahavira, Krishna, Buddha. And do you know
that Buddha has never happened again. No other person can be like
Buddha, nor is there any need to be. Nor has there ever been another
Mahavira. You were born only to be you, you were not born to be anything
else. And Buddha could only become Buddha because he did not try to
become Krishna. Nor did he try to become Rama. Buddha could become
Buddha because he plunged into his own being. You also can only be you.
You are unique. There has never been a person like you, nor will there
be. God does not repeat. God is not a broken down gramophone record that
goes on playing the same song, the same song, the same song.</p><p><br></p><p>God is eternally new, flowing, dynamic. He is not a pond filled with
stagnant water, decaying and rotting. He is flow, current. He is the
Ganges, he is flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Unnaturalness arises from ideals. Man has become hypocritical,
unnatural, complicated - because of ideals. People are teaching each
other. Mom and dad are teaching their children - become like this... or
look you should become like Buddha, or become like Alexander, or become
like so and so. No mom and dad say to their children, you are to become
you, avoid Buddhas. Avoid Mahaviras. They have happened. They were
beautiful, had greatness, but if you are to learn one thing from them
then learn to live your own self, you also live your own self. Do not
copy behavior, do not imitate. Imitation and copying behavior make man
false, because duality arises. You are something, you put something
over, it becomes double. You are one thing, you do something else. You
are one thing, you say something else. Your clothes are one thing, your
soul something else. There is a difference between your outer and inner
color. Your interiority is divided and to be divided is unnatural.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning of natural is, undivided living. You live just like you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>Think about this a little. This is a very important thing. Live just
like you are. Bad then bad, good then good. Let the whole world become
acquainted with who you are. Uncover yourself. Say, this is how I am.
This is my fate. This is how god has made me. It is his choice. If the
world accepts, fine. If they don’t accept, fine.</p><p><br></p><p>When you want the world to accept you then this problem begins. Then
it will be that you have to become like the world wants. When you want
the world to give you respect, then trouble begins</p><p>because the world gives respect according to its conditions. It you
fulfill their conditions, then they will give respect. If their
conditions are not fulfilled they will disrespect you.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who wants to be something will become fearful. He who is
fearful is weak. He has lost his soul. Don’t wish to be anything. As you
are is sufficient. You are participating in god’s vision, otherwise you
just wouldn’t exist. He has accepted you.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story from Junnaid’s life. Junnaid came to stay at a new
village. He was a Sufi fakir, a great fakir. His next door neighbor was
a mischievous man, a troublemaker. For three or four days he watched,
until it became more than he could endure. One dusk he was praying,
bowing on his prayer rug, after prayers he said, O lord, end this man’s
life. What need is there of him? He is my neighbor. He is a disturbance
and nothing else. He is torturing your people, harassing them, he is
evil.</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid had never had received an answer from god to a prayer, that
day it came. God said, Junnaid, you have been here four days. I have
been with this man for sixty years. He has been my neighbor for sixty
years, because all are my neighbors. I have tolerated him for sixty
years, you cannot tolerate four days? And when I tolerated him for sixty
years, there must be something, there must be some secret. You should
have thought, at least before praying, that one whom God has accepted,
what complaint can you have?</p><p><br></p><p>This is lovely. From that day on Junnaid never prayed to improve any
man. Let him be as god wishes. As he is is fine. Who am I?</p><p><br></p><p>Some people brought a woman to Jesus and said, “She has committed
adultery. It is written in the ancient scriptures, that she should be
stoned to death. What do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was sitting on the bank of a river. He must have fallen deep in
thought: “If I tell them to stone her to death, it will be violence.”
Then what will happen to Jesus’ principle of love? “And if I say no,
pardon her, people will be angry. People will say you are speaking
against our ancient religion, you are repudiating our ancient
scriptures.” In reality that is what people wanted. The people had come
just to stone Jesus with these stones if he said to pardon her, because
he is speaking in opposition to our religious scriptures. And if he says
to stone her, we will kill this woman and then say to Jesus: “What
happened to your love? To your compassion? Where has your compassion
gone? Where has your love gone? It was all phoney talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they did not know what Jesus will answer. Jesus said the ancient
scriptures are right. They must be right. Take up stones and kill this
woman – but let only those throw stones who have never committed
adultery nor who have ever even thought of committing adultery.</p><p><br></p><p>And the five who had stood before the villagers, probably all mayors
and members of the municipal committee, quickly retreated into the
crowd. Who wants trouble? The whole village knew. Everyone’s mischief
was known. And if they hadn’t committed adultery they certainly had
thought of it. To find a man who has not thought of adultery is
difficult, one who has not been infatuated, who has not been attracted.
All quietly moved back. Slowly slowly the people who had come with
stones in their hands let the stones fall where they stood. And slowly
slowly people began to disappear.</p><p>Evening was falling, the sun was setting. Just as the sun set and it
started getting dark, people escaped from there. The woman was left
behind, alone. The woman put her head at Jesus’ feet and said, “Give me
whatsoever punishment you want. I am an adulteress. I accept it. I am a
sinner. And your compassion has overwhelmed my heart. Whatsoever
punishment you want to give...”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Who am I to mete out punishments? Who am I to stand
between you and your god? You know, you know what you need to do, and
your god knows. I am not going to make any judgement. If you feel you
have done something bad, then don’t do it any more. And if it feels
alright to you then continue. The one to decide is god. The final
decision will be between you and god. There is no intermediary. Go
now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Consider what he is saying. A famous statement of Jesus is: “Resist
not evil.” Not even evil! Why? If god is allowing it to happen, there
must be some reason. Wake up within, live within. But the true thread of
life emerges in you.</p><p><br></p><p>NATURALNESS IS TECHNIQUE, ASANA HAPPENS...</p><p><br></p><p>If your life becomes spontaneous, it stops, by itself the ASANA
comes, sitting comes. This is the real yoga posture, the real ASANA.
Crossing your legs and sitting in Siddhasana is not the real yoga
posture. Anyone can do that. It is just a drill. It is physical
exercise. It is good, do it and the body becomes healthy. But you will
not find your being this way. If an asana comes spontaneously, from your
own space, then the experience of being begins.</p><p><br></p><p>... BODY, MIND, BREATH, BECOME STEADY.</p><p><br></p><p>Then by themselves body, mind, wind and breath start to be at peace,
start to be steady. Live spontaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen, whenever you tell a lie your breath wavers. Watch.
Whenever you lie, your breath will quiver. Its naturalness, its rhythm
will break. Whenever you speak the truth its rhythm is continuous.</p><p><br></p><p>Based on this, scientists have made a machine – the lie detector. In
the West it is used in the courts. A man may not know it, but there is a
machine beneath his feet. When he stands in court, a machine is placed
beneath him and its graph is produced in front of the judge. Like the
graph of a cardiogram, his graph is produced in front of the judge. The
man is asked, what time does the clock show now? He says nine fifteen.
Why should he lie? There is a clock in the court. The graph continues.
He is asked, how many people are there here? He counts and says fifteen.
Why should he lie? How can he lie? The graph continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Two or three questions are asked like this, which he cannot lie
about. Then he is asked, did you steal? His heart wants to say yes,
because if he did, he knows it in his heart. So his heart says, yes! And
he suppresses this yes. And from his head he says no. Meanwhile his
breath starts wavering, the graph starts wavering. He is caught. He was
lying.</p><p><br></p><p>No one can tell a lie without the breath wavering. So a man who lives
truthfully, lives naturally, his breath becomes steady by itself. You
will be surprised to know that in meditation a moment comes
spontaneously when the breath completely stops. Completely! If you put a
mirror close in front of a</p><p>person meditating like this, no vapor shadow will show on the mirror.
No sign of breath will appear on the mirror. Ordinarily if a mirror is
brought near the nose, vapor is breathed out and shows on the mirror.
And sometimes a person in meditation becomes frightened that perhaps he
is dying. There is no need to be afraid. You are not dying, for the
first time you are touching life, touching the ultimate life. Everything
stops, even the breath stops. There is such a deep peace that all coming
and going stops.</p><p><br></p><p>AWAKEN SANYAM, THE BALANCE, CONSCIOUS AHAR, THE INTAKE</p><p><br></p><p>SANYAM means to be in the middle. Not going to this extreme, nor to
that. Not too much food nor too little. Not too much sleep nor too
little. Live in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>AWAKEN sanyam...</p><p><br></p><p>And in the mind of one in whom centering has come, the middle has
come, all is corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>... THE BALANCE, CONSCIOUS AHAR, THE INTAKE...</p><p><br></p><p>Then eat suitable food, suitable AHAR. Don’t eat junk aahaar. Aahaar
is a great word. Its meaning is not just food. Aahaar means whatever you
take in. A man comes and starts gossiping. One who is centered will say,
“Brother don’t feed me this ahar. Don’t pour this useless gossip in my
ears. What’s the use? I have no interest in it. This is feeding junk to
my ears.” A man who eats suitable aahaar will not take in junk. He will
not take in useless stuff. Why? Because it too is aahaar. He will not
look at useless scenes. He will not sit at the television watching
fighting and violence. He will not go to the movies to see the same well
trodden stories again and again, the same love, the same triangle,
seeing the same thing again and again. He will not take this rubbish
inside, because you are created from whatever you pour inside. Food is
not the only aahaar, everything that you take in is aahaar.</p><p><br></p><p>... RENOUNCE SLUMBER THE DEATH OF LIFE</p><p><br></p><p>And such an individual will let go of unconsciousness. Don’t
understand RENOUNCE SLUMBER as meaning he will never sleep. He will
sleep but now he will not sleep unmindfully. This is a matter to
consider. Now he will not be unmindfully awake either. You are sleeping
even though you are awake. You are walking on the road and a thousand
thoughts are moving, the same old problems. You see neither the road nor
the people. You go on walking. If someone asks you abruptly, “On the
side of the road you have just passed, there is a tree. Are there
flowers blooming on it or not?” You will say I didn’t see a thing. And
you pass by there everyday. Daily going to work the same way, coming
home the same way, daily... “Flowers bloomed, did you see them?” How
could you see? You go on walking along immersed in your thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>People are walking drowned in their own thoughts. They are sleep
walking. This is slumber. As you start to be without thoughts,
wakefulness will come. Then you will be surprised to find, that this
world is very beautiful. When the dust of thoughts is brushed aside, a
correct reflection of the world starts happening. When the waves of
thought stop inside then the lake became still. On a quiet lake the
whole moon descends. The world is filled with unsurpassable colors. But
as long as this dust of the mind exists, the world appears dull and
boring. It seems as if everything is just the same.</p><p>Nothing is just the same. Every day happens anew. The sun you said
good by to yesterday, will not be the same sun you say good by to today.
Today the evening will blossom new colors. Today there will be a cloud
in the sky, there will be new colors. Today the radiance of the sunset
will be something different. Today the sunrise was also something
different. Everything is changing every moment. This is the meaning of
life. Otherwise everything has died. Existence is not dead, existence is
a living flow.</p><p><br></p><p>You have fallen asleep. But you don’t know it. You go on moving,
somehow go on moving. Right now your wakefulness is also slumber but a
moment of awareness will come, when you are asleep, the body is
sleeping, but inside a small lamp of awareness goes on burning.</p><p><br></p><p>It sometimes happens in your life too. Like when a mother has given
birth to a baby. Rains have come, clouds are thundering loudly,
lightening is striking. She doesn’t hear it. But the baby whimpers a
little and she hears it. What is it? The clouds are thundering in the
sky, lightning is falling and the mother doesn’t even know about it. She
is blissfully snoring. She is fast asleep. The baby whimpers, just a
little, and that very moment she is awake. Within her someone is awake,
a small part is awake watching for signs if the baby is having any
problem. Her motherhood is awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Here if all of you sleep, and someone comes and calls out Rama, then
no one else will hear it. But the man whose name is Rama will say,
brother, why are you harassing me? Won’t you let me sleep? No one else
will hear it. The sound Rama fell on everyone’s ears. But everyone knows
it, even in sleep they know it, know that this is not my name. They have
come to bother someone else. If someone asks you in the morning, you
will not be able to says that you had heard Rama. You will say I don’t
know anything. But Rama has heard it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, in a village a miserly man died. His wife just sat
there. She didn’t cry. A crowd had gathered. People wondered if she
hadn’t gone insane from the shock of it. And just then a beggar came and
stood before them. He beat loudly on his tin in front the corpse of the
dead man lying there. As soon as the beggar beat his tin the woman
started to cry. The neighbors were puzzled. They asked, what is it? She
said, now I am certain that he has died. If he doesn’t rise and come
into the house seeing a beggar, then he has died. He has definitely
died. Until now I was suspicious that he may have fallen unconscious,
but now it is certain. No matter how unconscious, if he saw a beggar he
would come in the house. Now it is certain that the soul has left the
body.</p><p><br></p><p>In your ordinary life also you will notice that sometimes, in certain
rare moments, something remains awake inside of you. As a student during
finals week knows at night that he keeps a little awake, several times
he opens his eyes and looks to see what time it is. Is it morning yet?
The exams are sitting on his head, a single tone stays awake inside of
him. These are small experiences of this.</p><p><br></p><p>A lamp is burning continuously in the yogi. This is why Krishna has
said, when the whole earth is sleeping the sanyami, the centered one, is
awake. What for everyone else is sleep, deep in the night, for the
sanyami that too is wakefulness. This does not mean that Krishna never
slept, that he stood up the whole night. He would go crazy. Or that he
played on his flute all night, whether there were listeners or not. He
himself would go mad and the neighbors too would go mad. He sleeps, but
only his body sleeps, his consciousness remains awake.</p><p><br></p><p>RENOUNCE SLUMBER THE DEATH OF LIFE</p><p>This unconsciousness has deprived you of the higher life. This is the
real death. If you let go of it, you will experience ultimate life.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ALL THE JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying to his yogis, to his disciples, to his sannyasins, don’t
fall into all these hassles of tantra, mantra, yantra - of tying on
talismans, of giving this mantra to people, of giving packets of ash, of
preparing magic potions!</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ALL THE JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA, ANCIENT MEDICINE,
ALL DECEIT.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all this deceit. Don’t get stuck in all of this. In this country
sadhus have been stuck in these for too long. They do all kinds of
things. They give medicines to the sick, they do miracles, they produce
sacred ash in their hands from nowhere and distribute the ash, they
produce talismans, produce watches. This is all deceit, just sleight of
hand. . These are all magic tricks.</p><p><br></p><p>If a street magician does these things you don’t fall at his feet and
cry out, O Sai Baba. I have found you, I was searching for you. No, you
know it is magic. Thinking it is magic, you understand it is some
sleight of hand. But if someone comes dressed in the ochre robes of a
sadhu and starts doing it, you just fall at his feet. It is just the
same, there is no difference, there is no difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says to his disciples:</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ALL JUGGLERY OF TANTRA, MANTRA, YANTRA, MEDICINE, AMULET, METALS
AND STONES.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THIS MEDICINEMANSHIP WILL ONLY LEAD YOU TO THE KING’S DOOR, THE
POLITICS.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you get into this kind of business, the nonsense of sacred ash
packets etc, then one day or another you will get entangled in politics,
you will arrive at the palace gates.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning of politics is position and fame, greed for power. If you
get into this sort of business you will become greedy for power,
otherwise what are you doing? All these ambitions are so people will
understand you are someone - significant, great. A seeker should be
natural, that I am nothing, that I am empty. He should have no claim.
How can any religious seeker show miracles? Only the unreligious can
show miracles, because behind miracles is the desire of the ego to be
worshipped.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ENCHANTMENTS OF ALL KINDS AND ALL SORCERY.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all this black magic - tantric curses, mantra sorcery, tricks of
hypnosis, tricks of possessing someone in your power, poisonings.
DROP... ALL SORCERY. Ghost and goblin hocus-pocus, using mantras to stop
someone’s work – drop all this useless nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN YOGESHWARA TO THE START OF THE PATH OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>And he says, O yogis. Listen! I will tell you the real path of the
yogi.</p><p>... TO THE START OF THE PATH OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>The real beginning to the path of yoga – I am opening the door for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>RENOUNCE ALL OTHER STATES, MEDITATE WHOLLY ON THE LORD OF THE
WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all the rest, remember only that one. Every morning I arise and
ask of you only you, Except you I have no wishes.</p><p>Drop everything else, they will all waste time and energy. Merge this
energy totally into only one prayer. Ask for him and don’t ask for
anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Every morning I arise and ask of you only you, Except you I have no
wishes.</p><p>With the exception of god may you have no wish. The wish should be
such that you are lost in the wish.</p><p><br></p><p>Searching for him, “Mir” was lost Take another look at your
searching!</p><p>Look at this seeking of mine, Mir says. I ventured out in search of
him and lost myself. Searching for him, “Mir” was lost</p><p>Take another look at your searching!</p><p><br></p><p>Look at this seeking of mine. I ventured out searching and lost
myself. Seeking, seeking, O my friend, Kabir became the sought</p><p>Only that one remains. Be lost, then he is met. I searched long but
still he’s not found</p><p>If he’s found, I’ll not be found.</p><p><br></p><p>I was searching much, but I didn’t meet him. He won’t be met until
this self is lost. And when he is met, if I go back and look I will not
find myself.</p><p>I searched much but still he’s not found If he’s found, I’ll not be
found.</p><p>Drown so much that only one desire remains, only one longing remains.
Surrender all longings unto it. If your journey moves in many directions
you will reach nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Master the one, all is mastered, Attempt all, all lost.</p><p>RENOUNCE ALL OTHER STATES, MEDITATE WHOLLY ON THE LORD OF THE WORLD.
DROPPING ALL KIND OF DRAMA, BURN LUST, ANGER, EGO.</p><p>And drop all acting. Stop all dramas. These are all just new forms of
lust and anger, these are just new arts of the ego. Be careful of
them.</p><p><br></p><p>EYES FULL OF LUST, DON’T WANDER ON PILGRIMAGES FAR AND WIDE</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes are filled with passions and you are journeying on a
pilgrimage. Nothing can come of this.</p><p><br></p><p>... NO NEED TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF MATTED HAIR TANGLED IN HEAVY
LOCKS.</p><p><br></p><p>And no matter how many dread-locks you grow, no matter how heavy your
dreads get, you will never become light and unburdened...</p><p><br></p><p>PLANTING TREES AND MAKING GARDENS</p><p><br></p><p>And no matter how much so-called virtue you you go on doing – you
have trees planted by the side of the road, or you have gardens planted
so travellers are shaded...</p><p><br></p><p>... DO NOT DIE DIGGING WELLS AND POOLS.</p><p><br></p><p>Or have wells dug so that people can get water to drink. But remember
Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>... DO NOT DIE DIGGING WELLS AND POOLS.</p><p><br></p><p>You will fall into the same well and die. Nothing can happen from
this kind of virtue. Virtue without meditation is worthless, because it
is the ego expanding itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Sadhus hold on to ego too. They say, I will not stop until this
temple is constructed, I will not stop until this well is dug. They sit
stubbornly resolved. And until their temple is built and their well is
dug, they go on sitting. Finally people become bothered with this seeker
sitting on their hearts every day and they give something saying okay
brother, and they see that the well is dug, saying okay brother, and
they have the temple constructed. But this is only an expansion of
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>I will do merit. In this only the “I” is fulfilled. There is another
virtue which is not your doing – which is born out of meditation. I am
absorbed in meditation in god, then whatever existence will do through
me, I am not the doer. If he wants a well dug, he gets a well dug. If he
wants a plant planted he gets a plant planted. If he wants to run a
school he runs a school. If he wants a hospital, he will have a hospital
made. But I am not the doer, now I am only a medium. First
meditation.</p><p>Don’t understand from this that Gorakh is saying that works of merit
are bad. Gorakh is saying that as long as there is ego behind the facade
of virtuous works, that same ego will be nurtured, will be beautified,
will grow bigger. First let the ego go, then virtuous works will come by
themselves. Then there is a great fragrance in it, a great beauty, a
great music.</p><p><br></p><p>Rahim in the heart’s power, how can the body disturb? When its shadow
falls on water, the body stays dry.</p><p>Once in the hands of the heart, one doesn’t worry about the body. One
in the grasp of consciousness, doesn’t worry about the body.</p><p><br></p><p>When its shadow falls on water...</p><p><br></p><p>As when you walk on a path and your shadow falls onto the edge of a
lake, your body will not wet at all.</p><p><br></p><p>When its shadow falls on water, the body stays dry.</p><p><br></p><p>Now your body is not wet. As one’s heart comes into its power, as
one’s mind becomes meditation, now whatever he does, however he does it,
wherever he goes, no bad result will come. Only the auspicious will come
from him, nothing inauspicious can come from him.</p><p><br></p><p>BREATH STOPS, BODY DECAYS, BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING</p><p><br></p><p>This body will break, soon the breath will be uprooted. BREATH
STOPS...</p><p>The breath will be pulled out.</p><p><br></p><p>... BODY DECAYS...</p><p><br></p><p>This body will soon become old, it will come close to death. Before
this happens:</p><p><br></p><p>... BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING</p><p><br></p><p>O king! O emperor! Take care. Before this, take care. Later you will
repent much. When death comes there will nothing left in your hands but
repentance. We have wasted our life on things that we cannot take with
us. Death will take away everything. All our splendor will be left
behind. And we didn’t gather meditation. Meditation can go with you in
death. Meditation is the highest wealth. Death cannot take anything from
one who has experienced samadhi, because neither weapons can pierce
samadhi, nor can fire burn it.</p><p><br></p><p>BREATH STOPS, BODY DECAYS, BE CENTERED IN SITTING O KING</p><p><br></p><p>Now take care O king. You are a king, if you take care you will find
your kingdom. In a moment, just one moment, the happening can occur.</p><p>INSISTING ON PILGRIMAGES AND VOWS...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t remain entangled in useless pilgrimages and vows. Don’t waste
time.</p><p><br></p><p>... DON’T WASTE YOUR LIFE CLIMBING MOUNTAINS</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t torture your spirit with uselessly climbing mountains,
going to Girnar, going to Shikraji, climbing the Himalayas: Kailash,
Badrinath, Kedar. Why are you torturing your spirit?</p><p><br></p><p>... DON’T WASTE YOUR LIFE CLIMBING MOUNTAINS</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t unnecessarily torture.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ALL THIS WORSHIP AND RITUALS, CHANTING WITH BEADS...</p><p><br></p><p>And how much worship and study have you done already? How much
worship, how much chanting? So much chanting done and what has
happened?</p><p><br></p><p>DROP ALL THIS WORSHIP AND RITUALS, CHANTING WITH BEADS; ENOUGH
PRETENSIONS OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have done plenty of yoga. Someone is standing on his head,
someone has twisted his body, someone has turned his body. What will
happen from all this? This is all a mimicking.</p><p><br></p><p>... ENOUGH PRETENSIONS OF YOGA.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t uselessly imitate.</p><p><br></p><p>ABANDON ALL YOUR BUSINESS AND TRADE OF KNOWLEDGE...</p><p><br></p><p>These are all occupations. Be careful of these occupations.</p><p><br></p><p>... YOUR STUDYING, CONTEMPLATING AND BEHAVIORISM.</p><p><br></p><p>A very revolutionary sutra. You have studied much, you have become a
parrot studying and studying, you have become a pandit studying and
studying.</p><p><br></p><p>... YOUR STUDYING, CONTEMPLATING AND BEHAVIORISM.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have dyed yourself well with superficial good behavior, you
have become very praiseworthy and become well skilled in popular
customs. You are expert in etiquette, have become very cultured. But
nothing happens from all of this. All this will be left behind. This
study and writing, these virtues you are superficially covered over
with, and these social conventions will all be left behind. When you go,
the bird that goes will be the same as ever. You never paid any
attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>RID YOURSELF OF GATHERING DISCIPLES...</p><p>You yourself have not yet awakened and you have gathered chelas,
disciples! Let yourself awaken then if someone comes, share – if you’ve
awakened first! First light your own lamp, then give light to any unlit
lamp.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me, saying, “We want to serve people.” I say, “It will
be a kindness. It will be a great kindness if you don’t do any service.
Still you have not yet done any service to yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, but,” they say, “we have heard that ‘without service there is no
fruit.’” Their eye is on the fruit, this is why they want to serve. Who
cares about service?... but from doing service you will go to heaven.
The fact is the reverse: services comes to fruition through one who has
attained heaven. Life becomes service for one in whom heaven has
arrived. And there is service in the actions of one in whose life fruit
has rained down. The whole matter is reverse.</p><p><br></p><p>They have come saying that they want to serve the people. I tell
them, see how many do-gooders are doing service for the people and
people are just dying. The more do-gooders increase, the more people are
caught in traps. Someone is pulling on their arms, someone is pulling on
their legs, someone’s got them by the throat. They say we are all
drowning. But no one pays any attention that their arms and legs are
breaking, that their necks are getting cut. And the do-gooders say, we
will continue doing service.</p><p><br></p><p>A Christian priest explained to his boys in school that one should do
service, one should do at least one good deed per week. And I give you a
week to do your good deed and report back. The next week he asked, have
you done your good deed children? Three boys raised their hands. One
child said that I did. The Father was very happy. He said, what good
deed did you do? He said, as you suggested if an old man or old woman is
crossing the street then give them your hand, I helped an old woman
cross. Happily the priest said, Wonderful! If you continue learning like
this you will go to heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the second boy, What good deed did you do? He said, I also
helped an old lady across the street. The priest started to get a little
suspicious, but thought there is no shortage of old ladies, he must have
found one too.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the third, what did you do? I too helped an only lady
across. The priest asked, The three of you found three old ladies? They
said, there were not three, only one. All three of us helped her across.
So he asked, are three needed for helping across the street? They said,
so what if three did it, if there was six it still would have been
difficult. We got her across with difficulty because she didn’t even
want to go across. We panted, got beaten. But we had decided that we
must do a good deed. You said that without helping an old woman across
the street there would be no fruit. The old woman proved very strong. We
were deluded in thinking she was so old, she was very powerful – and she
screamed and shouted and struck us, but we did it. Until we had brought
her over to this side, we didn’t leave, once done we all escaped.</p><p><br></p><p>Service! You don’t yet have the heavenly reward. You don’t yet have
being. Whatever you do in the name of service, will be doing something
wrong. Your situation is as if you had not yet studied medical science
and you go to serve patients. The same would happen, wouldn’t it? The
patients will die. If you don’t go perhaps they will survive. Not
everyone sick person dies, but if a doctor with no experience of
medicine, goes to serve patients and starts giving out prescriptions and
medicines they will die. They will survive the disease, but it will be
difficult to survive the doctor.</p><p>The world has suffered much from servants. Do-gooders have caused
much trouble. Remember the real experience has to happen in you
first.</p><p><br></p><p>RID YOURSELF OF GATHERING DISCIPLES, RENOUNCE TITLES AS GRAVEYARDS,
DEBATE AS POISON.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be caught up in the scramble for titles and degrees. In the
world there are degrees. Someone is an M.A., or a B.A., a B.S.C, an
L.L.B., an M.D., a Ph.D., a D. Lit., or a D. Phil. These are titles in
the world. And in the world of sadhus titles are also current. Someone
is a Mahant - high priest, someone is a Mandalacharya - teacher of the
inner circle, someone is a Shankaracharya, someone is this, someone
that. Someone writes the honorific Shree one hundred and five times,
another writes it one hundred and eight times. Karpatri Maharaj has
defeated everyone, he writes Anant Shree, meaning infinite unending
Shrees. Now you cannot surpass him. Like a small child saying, I am one
more than you. Whatever you say I am one more than that. Whoever makes
this statement has won. Now whatever number you say, he is one more.
Unending Shrees! Titles...</p><p><br></p><p>You are god. You have no need of any other title. All titles are
small. What additional title does god need? Those who have known have
declared your divinity. They have said you are the blessed bhagwan. You
are the highest. There is nothing higher than you. Now will you write
after The Blessed One, M.A.? L.L.B.? Ph.D.? You will look idiotic. All
existence is filled with blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>RENOUNCE TITLES AS GRAVEYARDS...</p><p><br></p><p>Understand titles as a graveyard. RENOUNCE... DEBATE AS POISON</p><p>And don’t fall into useless debate and scriptural arguments. Renounce
them as you would poison. HENCE I SAY, REALIZING DEATH...</p><p>If you don’t understand, if you don’t accept this, you will suffer
much in the end. HENCE I SAY...</p><p>Hence I say it to you again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>... REALIZING DEATH, O KING, REMAIN ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will be alone, will you not? Disciples will not be coming
with you, titles will not come with you, nor wealth, nor position. You
will go alone, know now that you are alone.</p><p><br></p><p>HENCE I SAY, REALIZING DEATH...</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say to remind you again and again, be now as you will be
going in the end. Then death will take nothing from you. Then you will
defeat death, death will not be able to defeat you.</p><p>... O KING REMAIN ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>SEEING A GATHERING DON’T BOAST KNOWLEDGE</p><p><br></p><p>People are very eager to find an opportunity to show their knowledge.
If only someone asks anything, they have a chance to show their
knowledge. This is a sign of ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>SEEING A GATHERING DON’T BOAST KNOWLEDGE</p><p><br></p><p>Watching to see if anyone is ready to hear, if anyone makes the
mistake of asking. Then the poor fellow is caught by his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately grab hold of his neck. Immediately start dishing out your
knowledge on him. Unless a seeker has come – one seeking moksha,
liberation – remain quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>... REMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND IGNORANT.</p><p><br></p><p>Until a true seeker comes, be a complete idiot, as if you can’t
speak, a deaf-mute. Mad, be a madman, so that people don’t start to ask
you on their own – why ask that madman?</p><p><br></p><p>A journalist came to visit Gurdjieff. He came for an interview.
Gurdjieff was drinking tea. He sat the journalist down next to him. Then
Gurdjieff said to a disciple sitting nearby, what day is it today? The
disciple said, today is Sunday. Gurdjieff banged his fist hard on the
table and said, how can it be Sunday? Yesterday was Saturday. When the
journalist heard this he was shocked out of his wits – what kind of man
is this? He got so angry he banged the table with his fist saying how
can it be Sunday? Who are you trying to befool? Who do you think you
are? Yesterday was only Saturday, and today is Sunday? The journalist
stood up. He said, good-by, I’ll be going now.</p><p><br></p><p>When he left he looked quite ridiculous. Gurdjieff laughed. The
disciples too were very happy. They said, you were outrageous! He said,
what’s the use wasting time with this idiot? REMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND
IGNORANT...</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says the same. He says just be insane if you see that some
muddled, stinking, superfluous person... journalist etc... just be
insane. He will go on his own and will never come back again.</p><p><br></p><p>REMAIN LIKE A MUTE, MAD AND IGNORANT...</p><p><br></p><p>And be completely ignorant. And those who know become totally
ignorant. And those who know become totally mad. And those who know
become total idiots, deaf-mutes – because there is no way to express
what they have known. Kabir calls it “the deaf-mute’s sweet”. Like a
deaf-mute who has tasted sweets! Those who know become totally mad
because what they have known is so different from the underlying logic
of this world that the logic of this world can take no part in it. They
become just insane. Those who know become totally ignorant because they
have found out that what they know is such that it cannot be
communicated, even knowing it, it cannot be shared. The experience has
happened, the taste is released, but it doesn’t form any idea.</p><p><br></p><p>This sigh of loving you – who can give news of it?</p><p>All acquainted with you become ignorant.</p><p><br></p><p>He says if I want to ask about you, whom can I ask? There are some
who don’t know. They are ready to tell. But they don’t know. And there
are some who know. But they are not ready to tell. They have become
ignorant. What news can they give anyone?</p><p><br></p><p>This sigh of loving you – who can give news of it? All acquainted
with you become ignorant.</p><p>One who has come to know, he himself goes beyond knowing. He has
become completely ignorant.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said at the time of his death, I know only one thing, that I
don’t know anything. This is the sign of one who knows.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER...</p><p><br></p><p>Drop any idea of being something. There are very strange thoughts
moving here. One who is poor wants to be rich. And one who is rich
thinks that the poor have more fun. This statement is very amazing:</p><p><br></p><p>DROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER...</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are commoners want to be kings, those who are kings think
the common man enjoys more! The emperors think, if only I could get away
from all this trouble, just take my guitar and roam from village to
village. What ecstasy the wandering monk must have? He has a ragged
quilt and he has the sky. Just beg a couple of crusts and sleep without
cares. Drink water from a stream, and sleep beneath a tree. What fun
that must be!</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are kings think a beggar is in great joy. And beggars
think, I am defeated, how long am I going to lie here under this tree,
will I never put a roof over my head? Will I never have butter to spread
on my bread? When will I acquire a throne or even a cushion?</p><p><br></p><p>Here all are suffering. One who has thinks, those who don’t have are
in bliss. One who doesn’t have thinks those who have are in bliss.
Gorakh says, let go of both. Wherever you are, however you are is good.
Don’t hope for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>... EAT BY BEGGING, REMAIN ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT.</p><p><br></p><p>What you receive, whatever god has given you, alms... What god has
given you, hold in the highest peacefulness. And let go of all hopes.
Don’t take the meaning of UDAAS, beyond hope, to mean that you are
beyond any hope, that you are sitting crying, that flies are buzzing
around, that you are just wasting time killing flies. Gorakh cannot say
this because Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>LAUGHING, PLAYING, THE KNACK OF MEDITATION. LAUGH, PLAY, ENJOY
COLOR...</p><p>Gorakh could not give that meaning to beyond hope. Someone else might
do that. Gorakh’s UDAAS, beyond hope, has another meaning. Ud + aas,
over + hope, one who has let go of hope, one who has gone beyond hope.
One who has no hope of the future. Who doesn’t say I will enjoy
tomorrow, when such and such happens. One who is enjoying right now. One
who says, who cares whether tomorrow comes or not. Has tomorrow ever
come? I enjoy right now.</p><p><br></p><p>LAUGH, PLAY, ENJOY COLOR...</p><p><br></p><p>One who is immersed in color and joy right now. One who’s festival of
spring is now. One whose festival of lights is now. One who doesn’t wait
for some other time to celebrate the festival of lights.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond hope means one who has let go of any kind of hope for the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP THE HOPINGS OF KING AND COMMONER, EAT BY BEGGING, REMAIN
ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT.</p><p><br></p><p>LET GO OF POTIONS, MAGIC BREWS, ALCHEMY...</p><p><br></p><p>Drop alchemical elixirs. People have been doing this business for
hundreds of years. Someone makes a ‘philosopher’s’ elixir, saying with
this elixir iron changes to gold. Or if a mortal man drinks it he will
become immortal. Drop all this.</p><p><br></p><p>LET GO OF POTIONS, MAGIC BREWS, ALCHEMY, RENOUNCING RIDDHI, MIRACLE
POWERS, RECEIVE SIDDHI, THE POWER OF FULFILLMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Let go of powers, only then will you receive power, will you attain
realization. There is a beautiful difference between powers and power.
Powers means: I can do miracles, I receive nectar, I can change iron to
gold, I can fly in the sky, I can walk through walls. These are powers.
If you drop all of these you will find power. Power is one. The meaning
of power is, totally merge into what is hidden within. There is no need
to fly in the sky, nor any need to walk through walls. The door is
sufficient. And birds go on flying in the sky – none of them has become
awakened. And if you really have your heart set on it, there are
airplanes. Sit in one.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to Ramakrishna and said I can walk on water, what can you
do? Ramakrishna said, you really can walk on water? How much time did it
take for you to learn this art?</p><p><br></p><p>He said, it took eighteen years. Ramakrishna started laughing. He
said, idiot of idiots! I give two cents to go across the river. You took
eighteen years to walk across water? What’s the use? Go and walk on
water, keep on walking. You really can walk on water, can’t you? Just
give two cents to sit in a boat and you can go across. For this two cent
crossing you wasted eighteen years?</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, drop this kind of things. These are all new ways for the
ego. DROP DRINKING WINE AND TAKING DRUGS...</p><p>Drop intoxicants. Intoxicants give you a false meditation. For
centuries sadhus have been taking drugs, making drinks of bhang hemp and
smoking marijuana. From the soma drink of the Vedas till</p><p>the present. Now LSD is made in America, it is a new scientific form
of soma. From the seers of the Vedas through Timothy Leary and Aldous
Huxley the hope continues that samadhi might happen through taking
drugs. Samadhi does not happen through taking drugs – a counterfeit
samadhi arises. Were it so cheap, to just take a drug and samadhi
happens... Yes, if you smoke marijuana, drink bhang, drink wine, a
little joy will come, because the worries of life can be forgotten for a
little while. But the worries are waiting in their place. When you come
down they will be back, in double potency.</p><p><br></p><p>DROP DRINKING WINE AND TAKING DRUGS, THEY CREATE ALL SORTS OF DREAMS
AND IMAGINATIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>Many types of fantasy and dream are born inside you under the
influence of all of these. NARI, MYNA, SARANGI...</p><p>Let go of sexual desire. If you are a man drop the idea that you will
receive something from a woman. If you are a woman drop the idea that
you will receive something from a man.</p><p><br></p><p>NARI, MYNA...</p><p><br></p><p>Sadhus go on training myna birds. Many sadhus are doing this business
of preparing a myna and having them choose cards. Sadhus are opening
people’s fate. They read palms. They foretell the future. They examine
astrology charts. Drop all this meaningless nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>SARANGI is an Indian violin. There are some who engage in this
business. They think it is enough, if the sarangi is played, all is
played. If the sarangi is played all has come. When will you play the
inner sarangi? Are you just going to go on playing on the outer one? Are
you going to beat only the outer drum, when will the inner dance begin?
This is why Gorakh says drop all outer distractions.</p><p><br></p><p>... THE SATGURU SAYS DROP ALL THREE.</p><p><br></p><p>The satgurus, the true masters, say let go of all three of these.
COMMENCEMENT, VESSEL, RECOGNITION, ATTAINMENT...</p><p>What can you do? COMMENCE the inner journey.</p><p>VESSEL. Get acquainted with the temple. Decorate the temple. Clean
it. Purify it.</p><p><br></p><p>RECOGNITION. Recognize being. Who is enthroned within you? Who is
this consciousness? Who am I? Raise the</p><p><br></p><p>who am I in your depth of depths. This one is the only real.</p><p><br></p><p>And the day recognition happens is the day you can claim the
ATTAINMENT. When the attainment comes, the consummation comes, your
liberation comes.</p><p>SHREE GORAKH-YATI SAYS DO THESE AND KNOW YOU’RE AN EMPEROR.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says, O emperor! I want to give you the one message of
awakening. I want to give you the one remembrance. Awake! This awakening
is within your capacity. It is your potential. Just as a tree is hidden
in the seed, in the same way god is hidden in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides placement in line what will be gained in the end? I have
never seen a drop that won’t become the ocean.</p><p>You are a drop. You can be the ocean. The ocean is hidden in the
drop. And until you become the ocean, don’t accept relief, do not relax.
Let that thirst take hold of you like a flaming fire. And all will be
reduced to ash. And all will be burnt up. And all will be destroyed.
Then higher life is uncovered.</p><p><br></p><p>DIE, O YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND
SAW.</p><p>Enough for today?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

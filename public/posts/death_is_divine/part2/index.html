It is for research only.]\nThe first question:\nQuestion 1\nEVERY TIME I COME HERE I RETURN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING SANNYAS. THE DESIRE TO TAKE SANNYAS ARISES IN ME MANY TIMES, BUT I AM UNABLE TO GATHER COURAGE TO DO IT. I GET SCARED THINKING, ’WILL I BE ABLE TO WALK JOYFULLY UPON THIS PATH OR WILL I HAVE TO LEAVE THE PATH HALFWAY AND THEN GO BACK?” BUT WHEN I PUT ASIDE THE IDEA OF TAKING SANNYAS, IT FEELS MEANINGLESS TO MOVE IN THE WORLD WHERE I HAVE BEEN MOVING.\nWHAT SHOULD I DO? PLEASE, SHOW ME THE PATH.\nChandra Rekha, the new always seems to be frightening. The familiar even if it is painful is still familiar. One is not afraid. One feels safe with the known even if it is not joyful. One is well acquainted with it. Before descending into the unknown, descending into the unfamiliar, fear is quite natural. So don’t make a problem out of fear.\nWhenever someone steps forward on a new path he hesitates. But only through stepping forward on the new is there growth in life. One who keeps rotating in the old becomes a bullock in a grain mill. It is always worth considering, “Am I blissful the way I am living?” If one is not then one must take\nrisks. New paths, new life-styles, a new search will have to be undertaken. This much is certain: you have nothing to lose. You did not find bliss through your old life style. If you had there would be no need for the new. The old has become meaningless, this much is certain. The new can turn out to be meaningful or it can turn out to be meaningless. But at least in the new there is a possibility of it being meaningful. The old has been through the press. You have seen it, understood it and lived it without receiving anything. As if one had been trying to extract oil from sand. How long will you rack your brains trying to get oil from sand?\nI do not say that the new will definitely give you bliss, because bliss is less dependent on the path that on the traveller, the one who travels on it. Hence the real change is not in the path, the real change is in the traveller. But to change paths is a beginning. You are outside, so the transformation also has to begin from the outside. If you gather courage to change the outside it will strengthen your courage to change inside. And if a few drops of bliss start showering on you then the search for the new will begin with joy and eagerness.\nBut one thing is certain: you have nothing to lose. Don’t worry unnecessarily. What have you achieved by holding on to the old? Nothing can be lost. Then what is the fear if there is nothing to lose? Either you will get something... At the most what can happen is that you will also get nothing from the new. Then you will have to search anew.\nAlways look at it this way: the way I have lived, the way I have thought, have I gotten anything from it or not? Think it over. Don’t think what will be gained or won’t be gained in the future – the future is unknown.\nSannyas is unknown. You will know it only by entering the experiment. You will know only by tasting. Before tasting something how will you decide whether it is tasty or not? You will have to trust somebody – somebody who has tasted it.\nYou often visit here Chandra Rekha. I have tasted it and I say unto you come forward, move ahead. And there are many here who are becoming ecstatic, who are dissolving. Seeing their ecstasy, their dissolving, the feeling for sannyas arises in your heart too. Otherwise why this desire for sannyas ? Your heart is already vibrating, it is only your mind that is hindering.\nThe mind is always traditional. The heart is always eager to go with the new and the head is always ready to stay tied to the old. The mind has nothing except the past. Whatever the mind has is a treasure of memories. It is all past. The mind has no future. Something becomes part of the mind only when it has become the past. When you have experienced something it becomes part of the mind. Mind lives in the past, in the dead. So the mind is afraid of moving into the future. But the heart is always ready to take the jump.\nYour heart is full of rejoicing, your heart wants to take the step, it is the mind which is cunning. The mind says, “Stop, think, first decide: what if you move on the new path and still get nothing? What if you have to return? What if you change your life style, take so much trouble and still the reward is not worth it. Think a little, calculate, figure it out.”\nBut if you listen to the mind you will never take the step.\nJust think of a child still in the mother’s womb. He is about to be born. If he has a mind, if intellect had already arisen it would say, “Where are you going? This way of life, this living in the womb is so comfortable. No troubles, no worries, no responsibilities: just sleeping twenty-four hours a day. Where do you think you are going? Nobody knows what is outside – what troubles will come, what challenges will come.”\nIf a child has a little arithmetic, a little logic then no child will ever be born from the mother’s womb. But there is no arithmetic, arithmetic comes later – fortunately! Logic comes later. The child has only heart, eager for the new, excited.\nIf we follow the intellect the earth will be full of senility. This is what has happened to this country. People have tied themselves to excessive intellectuality. Hence this country has become senile. This country has lost its youth. It is living in ruins. It sings praises only to the past. It has no enthusiasm for the new. It praises fallen yellow leaves. It turns its back on the new shoots that are blooming. It worships lifeless stones, the traces of the past. It has become a blind believer. And everyone’s mind has become like this.\nYou will have to gather courage.\nAnd I say only this to you, even to be defeated with the new is a victory and even to win with the old is defeat. Even if one gets happiness with the old at the very most it means convenience. Even if you suffer with the new it brings growth. The suffering received with the new is the only asceticism. This is what I call asceticism. Sitting with your body smeared with ash or lying down on a bed of nails or fasting – I don’t call this asceticism. I call all these the idiocy of a sick mind.\nAsceticism is one – the courage to go with the new, the guts to descend into the unknown! Just like a little baby leaving the mother’s womb.\nJust two days ago on a nearby tree a bird was raising her young. The babies kept on growing day by day. Two days ago they came out of the nest for the first time. When they came out of the nest, I was standing nearby. Both of them settled on a branch – wonderstruck, trying their wings, thinking should we go forward or not? They had never come out of their nest before, and their mother was sitting on a distant tree giving them a call, a loud call – this is how to call children.she goes on\ncalling: hearing her call they flutter their wings. But the attachment to the nest, safetyAnd they\nhave never before opened their wingsShould we open them or not? Will we be able to fly or not?\nSeeing their dilemma I was reminded of the dilemma of people newly taking sannyas. They try their wings the same way, think it over, get nervous, look back. But how long?\nThe mother kept on calling, kept on provoking, call after call. It took about half an hour, slowly slowly they fluttered their wings, moved a little further from the nest, sat on other branches of the same tree. They felt a little more confident, flew a little in the air and came back. Confidence grew further and then they flew awayThey have not been seen since. For two days I have been looking, but\nthey never came back. Why come back? The nest is left behind – two egg shells left in it broken to pieces.\nBirds who have never flown before gather courage to fly into the sky, but we have become human and still cannot gather courage.\nI am calling you everyday, calling out loudly from a faraway tree. This calling continues every day .\nYou say: EVERY TIME I COME HERE I RETURN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING SANNYAS. THE DESIRE TO TAKE SANNYAS ARISES IN ME MANY TIMES, BUT I AM UNABLE TO GATHER COURAGE TO DO IT.\nChandra Rekha, flutter your wings a little, get filled with the thrill of the new, gather a little courage. You have wings. I call you from the skies, I am giving you an invitation for the faraway. It is not that you do not have wings. You have wings as much as I do, only you are not confident. And how can you be confident? Fly and confidence comes.\nAll I can say is, with the new even suffering is sweet. And a little suffering will come with the new. Do you think those young birds who flew away did not experience pain? Gusts of wind, rain in the night, now they will have landed on some tree without their nest. Their wings will have gotten wet. They must have shivered with cold. They may even have thought to themselves, “Our nest was better, what trouble have we gotten ourselves into?” But still the joy of flying in the sky is such that all these prices can be paid. One must pay. And one who pays the price attains.\nA breeze heavy with fragrance And yet its feet are swift\nWhat season is this?\nWhen even pain feels intimate.\nSounds unknown adding magic to the melody of the waves Fields shaded by wintry clouds tossing flowers\nMy heart today out of control Sky soaked with songs\nWho has bewitched my spirit? Even pain feels intimate\nWhat are you saying, O wandering ray of sadness Why are you flowing aimlessly through the mists? Love has a saying:\nFulfillment is love’s promise always A dream has awakened in my eyes\nEven pain feels intimate\nDusk willows through the fields heavy with full youth Like the song of a reed only my solitary voice exists Solitude is beckoning\nPiercing the body and heart What season is this?\nWhen even pain feels intimate.\nWith the new, even pain is very intimate. With the old even convenience and comfort are nothing but slow suicide. What is there to leave behind? What will you lose? You have never gotten anything so what have you got to lose?\nSearch and seek! And go on searching until you find. Until then do not stop your feet, do not close your wings. No matter how afraid one is, one has to try his wings, one has to fly into the sky. And the challenge is already awake in you. How long will you deny it? How long will you keep turning back?\nDon’t let this turning back become a habit. Don’t let this turning back become your pattern. Before it becomes a habit, do something, wake up a little, gather courage.\nShould you wish to cross this roaring ocean\nYou must take life in your own hands and plunge into the waves. These waves come to you travelling from places far away Bringing messages afresh from that new world.\nHow much longer will you sit contemplating on the beach? Veenas taking voice call you sweetly from that other shore. Should you wish new life, new youth, new heart\nToday you must embrace the swelling ocean with your arms. Set forth today with new confidence\nLift up your eyes towards a new history. Let the old sky be left far behind\nAdorn your world with new sky today.\nShould the voices of new creation resound in your spirit You must dress anew every cell of your body.\nThis pain of annihilation will become sweet song of new creation This darkness of night will become the benediction of the sun.\nLet this ancient, ruined idol of the ages crumble now Any rock you lay your hand on will become divine.\nYou are kin of the Himalaya, no matter what depth the ocean Today you must contain the boundless sky in your wings.\nShould you wish to cross this roaring ocean\nYou must take life in your own hands and plunge into the waves.\nPlunge in! Even if you are afraid of drowning, plunge in. All new swimmers feel the fear of drowning. One who has stopped on the bank out of fear of drowning, will never be able to know the joys of swimming and floating. And far away is the other shore – and that is the destination. One has to go across, only then the meeting with the ultimate.\nSannyas is nothing but a small boat for crossing to the other shore. It is true that the other shore is hidden in the mists, it is not visible and this is why one has to join somebody who has eyes. This is why one has to be close to somebody who has eyes, so that the melodies fast asleep within you also become audible, so that the strings of your veena are also struck.\nChandra Rekha, this is why you continue to come. This coming will have no meaning if you don’t drown in this juice. Then it will be like someone coming to the lake but always returning thirsty. The thirst is not quenched just by coming to the lake, one has to cup his hands, bend down, fill them with water and drink it, then the spirit will be satisfied.\nSannyas is the process of bending down, of cupping the hands. The second question:\nQuestion 2\nWHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH NAMES AS TANTRA, VANMARG, AGHORPANTH, AND NATHPANTH? IS THERE NO POSSIBILITY THAT THROUGH CORRECT ANALYSIS AND RIGHT PRACTICE OF THESE PATHS, PEOPLE COULD UNDERSTAND THEM IN A NEW PERSPECTIVE AND NOT CONDEMN THEM AND REMAIN OPPOSED TO THEM?\nTaru has asked. And not just one, she has asked fourteen questions! I had to count them. She has never done this before. There is some connection with Gorakh... some sleeping memory has awakened, a waterfall has gushed forth.\nNo one is new here, everyone is ancient. Who knows how many paths you have travelled on. Who knows which masters you have been with. Your coming to me is not accidental. You have been travelling, you have been searching. This search has brought you here. Contact between me and those who have never travelled, those who have never sought, happens only with great difficulty. Even if they come, they stray off. Their coming is accidental. There is no foundation stone beneath their coming. Those who stick with me after they arrive, who stay around me – and Taru has come and stayed – it means that a deep thirst of their being is satisfied here. They have started getting a glimpse of what they had sought through many many doors and could not get. They are getting close to the destination.\nYou must have had some contact with Gorakh, Taru. You must have some connection. Questions have burst forth from her gushing out like an ancient sleeping song – and all of them are meaningful questions. None of the questions are intellectual, they have not been asked for the sake of asking: they arose. They have not been thought up because one should ask: she could not refrain from asking! Then she must have become afraid, because of asking fourteen questions. In the end she has asked forgiveness, that I should not get angry with her. So many questions... as if she were helpless, she had to ask, she couldn’t manage not to ask.\nThis is one question of the fourteen: WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH NAMES AS TANTRA, VANMARG, AGHORPANTH, AND NATHPANTH?\nThe first thing, all these names are names for Tantra. One name for Tantra is Vanmarg. Vanmarg means the path, the marg, of the left hand. You have two hands, one right, one left. These two hands are not just two hands, there are great mysteries behind them. Your right hand is connected with the left part of your brain – crosswise. Your left hand is connected with the right part of your brain. The brain is divided in two halves. Now science has also made many investigations into this and these investigations have revealed great secrets.\nYour right brain, which is connected with the left hand, is the source of poetry, of experiencing, of feeling, of art, of wisdom, bliss, ecstasy, dance, music, celebration, imagination. Whatever is sweet, whatever is feminine, whatever is beautiful, the birth of all of this is in your right brain. The left hand indicates the right brain.\nYour right hand is connected with the left brain. In the left brain arise logic, mathematics, activity, efficiency, cunning, politics, diplomacy, the world, prose, science, accounting, utility, the market – all these are connected with the left brain.\nThe world has always put emphasis on the right hand, because in the right hand is utility, expediency, mathematics, logic, the market, the shop, practicality. The left hand has appeared dangerous, has always appeared dangerous. How can one trust a poet? A mathematician can be trusted. How can one trust a dancer? A scientist can be trusted. But science is useful, what is the use of dance? Dance is self enjoyment.\nThe left hand is the symbol of your inner enjoyment. It has no goal. It has no direction. It is not going anywhere. It is just the art of living this very moment in a blissful, charmed, ecstatic way.\nWhat is the value of poetry? It can neither feed your stomach, nor cover your body, nor make a roof over your head. So we give poets only a little respect, in a certain proportion, like they are a decoration but not necessary. We can tolerate one man becoming a poet in society, but we will not tolerate a group of them, because a poet does not seem to be of any use. What is his utility?\nSomebody asked Picasso, “What is the utility of your paintings?”\nPicasso hit his forehead. He said, “You don’t ask flowers what their utility is. And the cuckoo sings and you don’t ask her what her utility is. And when the sky is filled with stars you don’t ask them what their utility is. Why ask only me?”\nPoets and painters, sculptors and musicians, they have always been saying they have no utility. And life does not end with utility. Remember the words of Jesus: “Man cannot live by bread alone.” He needs something more, he needs something more than bread. Bread is necessary but not sufficient. There can be no poetry without bread, it is true, but if there is just bread without poetry then living and not living are almost identical. Every day stuffing your stomach, living and finally dying. If no poetry has awakened, if no song arises, if no veena is played, if no music ever flowers on the flute, what meaning is there?\n“Svanthah sukhaya ragunatha gatha – the song of the supreme is of self enjoyment.” One who is filled with self contentment is the one who becomes filled with love for that ultimate beloved.\nThis is why the left hand has always been a sign of danger. So we call those who we are afraid of Vanmargi – ‘leftist’.\nYou will find thousands who call me a Vanmargi. They are right. I am a Vanmargi, a ‘leftist’, because I am teaching you the art of Svantah sukhaya – of self enjoyment.\nMathematics is not everything. There is a world beyond mathematics and that world brings fulfillment, there is contentment in that world, there is light in that world.\nThe necessities should be taken care of, it is true. But what else? When basic needs are fulfilled, what else will you do? This problem has arisen today in the West, because needs are fulfilled. The West has taken care of all the outer necessities. Try to understand the difficulty. The right brain, connected with the left hand, was not used in fulfilling the basic needs. The West denied religion, denied poetry, denied music, denied all dimensions of mystery. The West is living only on mathematics, science, matter: things which have solid proof. A continuous application for three hundred years, the application of the right hand, has made the West affluent. There is money, wealth, housing, beautiful roads, delicious and abundant food, everything is more than is needed. An age of affluence has dawned in the West. But it has come through three hundred years of continuous denial of the source of self enjoyment – of Svantah sukhaya.\nSo the West has become rich, now what? Because they have lost the art of enjoying happiness, the West is dumbfounded. Where to go now? What to do? Whatever the world of work can accomplish\nis already complete. There is great uneasiness in the West. Western man is unable to even take Sunday as a holiday. The very habit of taking holidays has been forgotten. Work and work and work... So much emphasis has been placed on work that work is made into a god. Hence the art of play has been forgotten. Sitting gossiping and laughing, or playing on the strings of a veena, or growing grass in the garden, or lying down under the stars in ecstasy, or going out in a boat... No, all these are without meaning. For three hundred years only one thing has been taught and repeated from kindergarten to university: the value of work.\nSo today if someone is lying down in his boat just floating under the starry sky, he feels as if he is committing a sin: “Work is virtue, so I am committing sin.” A feeling of guilt has become associated with moments of happiness. Whenever you become happy, you feel as if you are doing something wrong. What are you doing humming a song? You want to suppress the song in your throat. What will you get from it? Logic comes up, calculations arise – what’s in it for you? what is its benefit? Why are you playing the flute? Do some work.\nPeople come to me and say, “You are teaching people meditation? What will meditation accomplish? Teach work.”\nWork has utility. And I do not say to drop work. But I want to say to you that the use of work is that you can be blissful in the non-work moments. The use of work is that you can be free of work. The six days that you work hard in the market are so that on the seventh day you can leisurely stretch out your legs, you can lie down in the sun, or sit down in the shade of a tree, or talk with the flowers, or gossip with the moon and stars, or sing an ecstatic song, or tie ankle bells on your feet, and dance! This is the goal of striving for six days. And if five days work is enough, work only five days, dance for two days. If four days work is enough, then three days... go on reducing this way. Work has to go on being reduced. Leisure has to go on being increased. Leisure, is the aim.\nInsanity starts creeping into the life of anyone who has no rest, no meditation. The moment work is over they don’t know what to do. There is a reason many people are going mad in the West, it has a reason: the days of work are over, that job is accomplished. They thought work was life, now they don’t understand life and what more it can be.\nThe reason many people are committing suicide is the same. What is the point of living now? One has accumulated wealth penny by penny, how long can you go on accumulating? He has forgotten why he was accumulating wealth. He was accumulating wealth so that at some moment he could sit down leisurely, with no worries. He forgot, because only one part of the brain was used in accumulating. That part has been active, and the other half which has not been used, has slowly slowly filled with dust.\nVanmarga means the aim of life is not work but rest. The goal of life is not money but meditation. The goal of life is not mathematics but poetry. The highest peak of life is not attained through science, it is attained through religion.\nVanmarg has always been a word of condemnation. And it was natural in the past, there were other reasons then. The further back you go the more the world was poor, means were not available. It seems only natural that in those days of poverty people made work very significant, gave it great value. And if the people who gave value to leisure in place of work were opposed by the society it is\nnot at all surprising. But this ancient habit has remained with us like a complex in our minds – even now we are afraid.\nThe mathematical, the calculating mind is opposed to enjoying taste – it is always against everything which gives rise to happiness inside you. It goes on fulfilling the vow of no-taste. It is against beauty, it can make ugliness spiritual. It is against health also, because health is bodily happiness.\nA famous German thinker, Count Keyserling, wrote in his journal after traveling in India, “Going to India I experienced that sickness is spiritual and health is unspiritual, because health is of the body.” This is why a spiritual person will not take joy in good health. He is the enemy of the body. This is why the world has become the enemy of love, because love is great happiness. We have trained ourselves to be against all these things.\nVanmarg, the left hand path, has given the opposite message. Vanmarg says: Love is prayer and love is the ultimate. And Vanmarg says nothing is to be dropped because whatever the ultimate has given can be used. Use it, and make it a step. Transform it into a step of the temple of the ultimate. Don’t take it as a stone on the path, don’t take it as a hindrance. Make steps and climb up. Make even sex a step, don’t oppose it either.\nThe amazing message of Vanmarg is, that if you are intelligent you can use even poison in such a way that it becomes medicine. If you are an idiot you will make even medicine into poison. This is the fundamental sutra of Vanmarg: the intelligent makes even poison into medicine. This is intelligence. Escapists are cowards, not intelligent. Vanmarg will not run away.\nEscapists have been very respected in the world. The reason is, when you look at an escapist you begin to think he is more special than you. You are mad after money and someone has kicked away his money and gone to the jungle, you are immediately impressed. You are impressed because you are so infatuated with money and this man certainly has a quality, he has kicked it away. This is why you are more impressed by Mahavira than by the enlightened King Janak. Janak’s name is rarely heard. You are more impressed by Buddha because he renounced the royal palace. If you praise Krishna you do it in a quiet voice, a little frightened, a little nervously.\nEven if people praise Krishna they praise the Krishna of the Geeta. Very few people have the courage to accept all of Krishna. Because Krishna seems to be just like you, or rather a little worse than you. You somehow explain to yourself, okay he was God, he must have done it, he must have danced with his girlfriends. But this man Krishna is not given his full splendor. You may want to avoid calling him god. You look for an excuse. Your mind begins to be troubled. You start feeling uneasy.\nI was a visitor at someone’s house – at a Hindu family. It was a respectable family, a high caste family. It happened ten or twelve years ago. My book, “From Sex to Samadhi” had been published. The man was very upset. He said, “You should at least have given it another title. When someone reads the book he will find out what is really in it, but this title is very dangerous. You should give it some other name.” Also on the first edition there is a picture of the ecstatic Tantra statues from the temples of Khajuraho printed on the cover. He said, “What got into your mind? If this is the title it should have a picture of Buddha in a state of meditation on the cover... but statues of Khajuraho? Later when someone actually reads the book, he will be very upset seeing all this.”\nI was sitting in their living room, I said as I looked at their wall... They had hung a big picture of Krishna in which he has stolen the clothing of naked women who are bathing in the river. And he is sitting in a tree. I said, “You keep this picture in your living room?” He looked up, he stopped for a moment. Perhaps he had never looked at the picture in this way. He said, “You are right. That picture has been hanging there since my father’s time. And sometimes I am a little embarrassed, but no one pays any attention to it. Because this is God, he must be doing right. We have accepted it.”\nBut when I went to his house again, the picture had been removed. I asked him, “What happened?”\nHe said, “No. Since the day you pointed it out, I have been aware of it. I began to be very upset and thought it better to remove the picture. So I disposed of it.”\nEven your acceptance of Krishna is incomplete. You want to select and cut many things. You are always ready to make revisions of Krishna. People believe in Krishna according to their own understanding. They believe as much as they can believe, rejecting the rest. What is the problem? The problem is, that it is clear to you that Mahavira appears to be moving opposite from you. You can respect him because you know your greed, your lust, your anger, your ardent desire, and he has renounced all of this. He is special, now there is no need for proof, but Krishna? He is standing right in the same world where you are!\nTo recognize Krishna one needs eyes of great depth. To recognize Mahavira is within the powers of even a blind man, there is no problem. A blind man too can recognize, yes, Mahavira has renounced everything. But until the inner eye has opened it is difficult to recognize Krishna, because he is standing right here, there is no difference. There is no difference from the outside, there is a difference from the inside. So as long as you have no ability to see within, you will not be able to understand Krishna.\nKrishna is a Vanmargi, a ‘leftist’. This is why the Jainas have thrown Krishna into hell. In their scriptures they threw him into hell. He is a Vanmargi. What could be more Vanmarg? A natural acceptance of life, an eager acceptance, a welcome acceptance... The ability to live life in its total creativity, courage... There is nothing bad in life. If there are thorns, they are there ready to protect the flower. Whatever exists in life is beautiful. And if there is anything we cannot see the beauty of then somehow it is our mistake. How can the ultimate make something ugly? The ultimate is manifest in all forms. In lust too the ultimate is hidden – in kama too Rama is hidden. Very few people can muster such courage. They don’t have this broad a vision.\nTaru this is why people are afraid of names like Tantra, Vanmarg, Aghorpanth, Nathpanth. It is because they will shatter your established conventions. These beautiful names have become swear words. If people call someone a Vanmargi then the matter is finished. Such and such man is a Vanmargi – means you have totally repudiated him, now there is no need for refutation. Now there is no need to go further into his arguments: what he says, why he says it. You have labelled him Vanmargi, now the man is finished.\nAghorpanth. A beautiful word like aghor has become an abuse! If you call someone an Aghorpanthi he will be ready to fight. People call someone an Aghori when they want to insult him.\nDo you know the real meaning of the word aghor? Aghor means easy, simple, direct. If you call someone ghori it could be an insult. Ghor means complicated, terrible, dense. When there is a really terrible war then people say ghor-ghamaasaan – terribly fierce. Ghor means complicated, messed up... Aghor means simple childlike innocence. But people say it when they want to insult. People say Morarji Desai is an Aghori because he drinks his own urine – innocent? It means they are are insulting him.\nAghor can be used only for a few Buddhas. Gautam Buddha is an Aghori, Krishna is an Aghori, Christ is an Aghori, Lao Tzu is an Aghori. It can only be used for such people. Gorakh is an Aghori. Simple, innocent, straightforward... So simple that there is no opportunism in his life. The very mode of manipulating is gone.\nThose who you call religious are also calculative. They look to see if they have done enough fasting to go to heaven, or are they fulfilling enough vows to go to heaven, or have they given enough charity to go to heaven? This is all calculation. This charity is part of the market. This charity is business, a trade. Sin is hidden in this virtue. The meaning of Aghor is: simple, direct – one whose opportunism is finished, who lives like children live. Aghor is the highest state, the state of a paramahansa. But unfortunately these have become swear words.\nNathpanth: because of Gorakhnath and Gorakh’s master Macchindranath this branch of Tantra began to be called Nathpanth. It’s feeling is very lovely. The meaning of Nath is master, lord. What the Sufis call, “Ya Malik.” Everything is his, the master’s, the lord’s. We too are the master’s, the world too is his, everything is his. We live according to his wish. We live as he would have us live. We will not project our own will. We will not live by effort. We will flow as one flows in the current of a river, we will not swim. This is the feeling. As long as he is the master why should we bring our will in between? If our will comes, then our ego comes, if our ego comes then we are lost. So we will live without ego, as he wills...\nAs dry leaves fly in the wind, whether they go east or west, north or south, wherever the wind carries them there is no worry. No fight, no resistance, they do not struggle to go west, saying they will not go to the east, why are you taking us east? No, what will do leaves have? A Nathpanthi is one in whom this has happened. Gorakh was like this. He lived in this spontaneous acceptance. He lived in this simplicity. But people live by the ego. The language of life of most people in the world is the language of ego. Naturally, such simple people cannot be tolerated. Others will feel a great danger with such people. If they start living so simply others feel what will happen to morality? Immorality will spread – as if there were morality now.\nThese are very strange ideas. People talk as if there were justice now, then injustice would spread. Where is justice? What kind of justice? Hypocrisy in the name of morality. People are wearing false masks, people are wearing counterfeit masks. Where is morality?\nBut people understand that if everyone begins to be simple, begins to live easily, begins to live naturally and say it is the will of the ultimate then morality will be destroyed.\nThe fact is the opposite. People have become immoral by continually living by will. Who on this earth is more immoral than man? Who on this earth is more violent than man? Who on this earth murders his own kind more than man? Birds and animals at least don’t kill their own species. No\nlion kills and eats lions. No hawk attacks hawks. Man is the only animal on this whole earth who murders his own species. And not just a few – thousands, millions! Such joy in killing! And strangely this too is dressed up in the attire of law. Muslims call it a jihad: Christians call it a crusade. It is a holy war, so kill. Then there is no harm, the more you kill the better. The more you kill the more certain heaven is.\nPeople fight jihads, fight crusades for centuries. They go on butchering each other in the name of God. Butcher them, in anyone’s name. Sometimes butcher in the name of politics, sometimes in the name of religion, sometimes in the name of sects, sometimes in the name of scripture. These are all excuses, the object is killing. Without killing the mind will not be satisfied. What kind of mankind have we given birth to? What kind of sick minded man have we given birth to?\nPeople are burning with sex desire. There is nothing besides sex inside of them. They sit repressing it. This is why whenever anyone says to them, accept sex naturally, it is a divine gift, there is great turmoil inside of them. Because they know that if they naturally accept sex everything will be disturbed. They have repressed so much there is a volcano burning under them. How can they accept it naturally?\nThink of it as if someone has fasted his whole life, he goes on dying of hunger and you come and say to him, “Friend, accept your hunger naturally. When you feel hunger, eat.” He will completely freak out. He will say, “If I accept it naturally then I will never get out of the kitchen, because I know myself, I know I am thinking of food twenty four hours a day.” A fasting man thinks only of food twenty four hours a day. “... so I will not be able to get out of the kitchen. I will be stuck sitting there.”\nYou will be surprised at what he is saying – people who enjoy food don’t sit twenty four hours a day in the kitchen. But understand what this man is saying, this poor man is also right. He thinks of food twenty four hours a day, one who fasts thinks of nothing but food.\nThis is why when someone like me speaks of living spontaneously people are very nervous, they are very afraid. Sometimes repressed types of people come here, and they are frightened. Because they know that if what I am saying is right, then the disease repressed within them will immediately be revealed, their life long repressed disease will immediately manifest. They will become insane. They will not be able to endure it. To save themselves from this predicament they go against me, they become opposed to me.\nThere is a reason for opposing me. The truth of what I am saying appears so dangerous to them – it appears dangerous not because truth is dangerous. It appears dangerous, because until now they have lived in so much untruth that now it seems very difficult to drop untruth. And if it drops then what they have held together their whole life will break...\nIn their life they do not have self restraint, only a false insistence on self restraint. That man is truly disciplined who has become aware and has wholly transcended his sex desire. To him it doesn’t make any difference. He will not find any objection at all to what I say. Those who take objection to what I say are only indicating their diseased minds, but they think they are saying something against me.\nThere was a great movement opposing Freud all over the world. But Freud was speaking simple straightforward truths of life. Freud is a Vanmargi. Freud suggested to let repressed impulses flow\nagain. He was opposed throughout the word, all the religions opposed him. You opposed him because the ground beneath you was slipping. You will all be wrong if Freud is right. And it is better if you go on proving yourself right. And the crowd is yours. The crowd is with you. Truth is always alone. Untruth is very ancient. The crowd is happy with it. The crowd has given it company for so long. All the vested interests of the crowd have become joined with it. You are completely freaked out, you have become completely frightened. In your fear, in your freak out you start opposing. But truth is not defeated this way, truth returns again and again.\nVanmarg goes on returning again and again. Tantra will be proclaimed again and again, until man becomes spontaneous. The day man becomes spontaneous will be the day Tantra is no longer needed. Tantra is only medicine. Vanmarg, the left handed path, is only a means to bring people to the path who have gone off the other side. One who is come on the path is neither on the right nor on the left. Both left and right are his. He does not belong to either. His state is of transcendence. He has gone beyond both.\nYou have asked: WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH NAMES AS TANTRA, VANMARG, AGHORPANTH, AND NATHPANTH?\nThere is reason to fear. You have such a load of gunpowder inside of you that a tiny spark of truth and you will explode. How can you not be afraid of sparks? When you are ready to drop your gunpowder you will no longer have any fear of sparks. You are afraid of that which makes you uneasy inside. And truth makes you very uneasy. If you have made a continuing connection with untruth, if you have wedded yourself to untruth, truth will upset you very much.\nMulla Nasruddin got married. As is the Muslim custom, on the honeymoon the bride lifted her veil in front of Mulla, opened her ‘burqa’. It was the first time Mulla had seen her, he had not seen her previously. He was very disappointed. He had never seen a more ugly faced woman in his life! According to the custom, the bride asked “Before whom can I remove the veil?”\nMulla replied, “You can remove it before anyone, just don’t open it in front of me. Remove it in front of the whole world, remove it in front of anyone you want to, just don’t remove it in front of me. If this burqa remains down now it is better.”\nYou are afraid of this ugliness. You have veiled yourself, you don’t remove it. You become angry with whoever removes your veil, whatever shows your dirtiness. You become angry with whoever shows your rubbish within. And the master has to show you your inner rubbish. If you don’t see it how will you become free of it? If you are not liberated from the inner sense of worthlessness that is riding in your chest you will sink into it. You will drown in it. It will cause your drowning. The rocks you have bound to your chest have to be removed. Although you think they are philosopher’s stones, they are drowning you.\nWhenever there is a new declaration of truth there are waves of unrest in all direction where untruth has spread its nets. Cut the throat of truth, poison the truth, silence the voice of truth – all these kinds of efforts start being made. And there is no reason to be angry about it. It is completely natural. It is a matter for compassion, a matter for kindness.\nBuddha said to his disciples, “The people that you go to teach are the ones who will harm you. Out of kindness you go on giving truth and they will throw stones at you. So don’t be angry. They are\nhelpless: what can they do? You have come to destroy the truth they had believed for centuries. You have started shaking their house. They thought this house was their security. You have started knocking down their walls. You have started lifting their veils and showing their ugliness. They will be angry.\nOne disciple – Purna – used to to on pilgrimage, taking the Buddha’s message. Buddha asked, “Where are you going?”\nThere was a part of Bihar called Sukha. He said, “None of your sannyasins have gone to Sukha yet, I will go there.”\nBuddha said, “It would be good if you don’t go there. The people of that area are dangerous, this is why no one has gone. If they insult you what will happen to you?”\nPurna replied, “If they insult me then I will consider myself fortunate that they didn’t beat me, they only insulted me.”\nBuddha said, “And if they beat you what will happen to you Purna?”\nPurna replied, “I will consider myself fortunate that they didn’t kill me, they only beat me.” Buddha said, “One more question, if they kill you what will happen to you as you are dying?”\nPurna replied, “What else could happen? These are such good people that they have released me from living in this body in which I might have committed some mistake. Now no mistake is possible. They have released me from living in this body where my foot may have gone on wrong paths, anything could happen, I could stray off. They have liberated me from this body. I will die filled with kindness for them. I will die full of gratitude for them.”\nBuddha said, “Then you go. Go anywhere. Wherever you go, you will find your friend, because now you cannot see any enemy.” It is not that by closing eyes there are no enemies. But one who no longer sees enemies is one who can declare the truth. Enemies will arise, enemies will immediately arise. The truth always gives rise to enemies. Do we have enough understanding that we can stomach the truth? Do we have a big enough heart to allow the truth to permeate us? ... to make it a guest inside us? If we can let ourselves be a host to truth, let truth be a guest... but do we have this capacity? This is why it goes on happening, insults continue, opposition continues, but truth goes on making its declaration again and again.\nAnd I say unto you, that truth comes from the right half of the brain, connected with the left hand. Calculation comes from the left half of the brain, which is connected with the right hand. A calculative person can never accept poetry. A person who thinks money and wealth are valuable cannot understand the value of meditation. And one for whom business is everything cannot be in the temple. And if he goes to the temple, the temple is corrupted by him.\nThe third question: Question 3\nWHAT IS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SAMADHI LIKE?\nYou will know only if it happens. It is not that it can be said. A few indications can be given. A lamp is suddenly alight in the dark - it is like this. Or like a sick man dying and suddenly the medicine works... nearing death the medicine works and suddenly ripples of life, the thrill of life spreads again – it is just like this. Like a corpse has come to life – the first experience of samadhi is like this.\nIt is an experience of immortal nectar. It is an experience of the ultimate music. But it happens only when it happens. And only if it happens will you be able to understand. You will not be able to understand from my saying it. It is like being in love. Who can explain it to anyone? One who has not loved, one who does not know love, no matter how times you try racking your brains, how much you explain – he will listen to everything, but he will still say I don’t understand a thing. Please explain a little more.\nIt is like trying to explain light to the blind, or sound to the deaf – they will not be able to understand. One whose nostrils are damaged, who cannot smell anything, how will you explain the experience of fragrance? Experience cannot be put into words, but a few indications can be given.\nSongs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings. the lingering ache of the heart was\nmolded by devotions, nurtured by imagination; the path was unknown to me,\nI had not yet gone on it, the narrow lane of love;\nbut steps suddenly went forward, and the heart also went ahead;\nall illusions from folk tradition crashed down in one moment! Songs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings.\nThat sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised, gratefully;\nI cannot say: was it victory for the heart, or defeat? the agony was tender;\nthe voice remained silent, but\nthe secret of the heart was out;\nthese eyes have said all I didn’t want to say,\nSongs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings.\nWhat imagination had tendered I found right in front of me, that moment also came;\nthat beautiful image overwhelmed my heart, the mind enchanted, too shy to look;\nwhen I could come around I was lost in myself\nand now my spirit remains quite completely lost! Songs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings.\nLike a song, suddenly awakening in your heart. Like suddenly, an uncaused cascade of juice bursting forth spontaneously within you.\nthe path was unknown to me, I had not yet gone on it,\nthe narrow lane of love;\nAnd suddenly love awakens... the first experience of samadhi is like this. As if it were autumn and suddenly spring comes! And where trees standing dry and barren become green, loaded with leaves, abloom with flowers – the first experience of samadhi is like this.\nbut steps suddenly went forward,\nAnd feet unexpectedly step forward in one when love has awakened or when light has arisen, or when one has heard the inner sound. Then fear does not grip one. One lets go of all fear when love has awakened. This is why mathematical, calculating people say love is blind – because the lover goes where people with eyes are afraid to go. Where people with eyes say, Be careful! Take care! Protect yourself. Don’t get into trouble! – the lover enters there dancing and singing.\nThis is why so called intelligent people say love is blind. The reality is just the opposite. No one is blinder than the intelligentsia. Only a lover has eyes. If love is not eyes, then what are eyes?\nthe path was unknown to me,\nI had not yet gone on it, the narrow lane of love;\nbut steps suddenly went forward, and the heart also went ahead;\nall illusions from folk tradition crashed down in one moment!\nThe first experience of samadhi is like this. All previous beliefs, all previous convictions, all previous sects and scriptures, flow away like a river in the first spate of rain that carries off all the rubbish left along its banks.\nThat sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised, gratefully;\nYes, you will remain standing in wonder. You will not be able to comprehend what is happening. Thoughts will stop. There is no opportunity to think. Something has happened beyond comprehension.\nThat sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised, gratefully;\nI cannot say: was it victory for the heart, or defeat?\nIt is difficult to say – who won, who lost? Now there are not two, this is why it is right to say won, right also to say lost. In one sense lost because one is obliterated. In another sense won because one has become the whole. In one sense the drop is defeated because it is obliterated, in another sense victorious because the drop has become the ocean.\nI cannot say: is it victory for the heart, or defeat? the agony was tender;\nBut this much is sure that the misery was very lovely, very sweet. Hasn’t Gorakh said, ... SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW. It is very sweet and lovely, a death very sweet and lovely!\nWhat imagination had tendered I found right in front of me,\nThe truth is whatever you have imagined appears small when it faces the truth. You get much more that what you asked. When it comes, it comes crashing through the roof.\nthat moment also came;\nYou could not believe it would come. It comes. that moment also came;\nthat beautiful image overwhelmed my heart, the mind enchanted, too shy to look;\nOne cannot believe, how can I deserve this? – that I meet the beloved, that the union with the beloved could happen.\nwhen I could come around\nI couldn’t manage to say anything, not even two words of welcome...\nI was lost in myself\nand now my spirit remains quite completely lost!\nThe first experience of samadhi is like being completely lost, missing, as if completely plundered... One doesn’t know if defeated or victorious. But it is certain that the limits are broken, confinements are broken – the whole sky has descended. Kabir has said, “The ocean has disappeared in the drop...” The limitless has entered the limited, the unseen into the seen... The invisible present in what was already visible.\nThe first experience of samadhi is the most valuable experience of this universe. And then there is experience after experience, lotus after lotus goes on blooming. Then there is no end, then lotuses go on blooming in a continuous series. It never happens that the experience of samadhi becomes less, it just goes on increasing. This is why god is called infinite, because the experience is never completed.\nIt is described in the life of Jesus that when John the Baptist – John too was a remarkable man – initiated Jesus... John was Jesus’ master. He took Jesus to the Jordan river to baptize, to initiate by water. A great crowd had gathered because John had been saying, “The man I am waiting to baptize is coming, he’ll be coming very soon, he has almost arrived.” So a great crowd had gathered to see him. And when Jesus came John said, “The man I have been waiting to baptize has come. Now my work is done. Now he will take care of everything. I am already old...”\nWhen he initiated Jesus in the river Jordan the story says a very beautiful thing – it is symbolic – that a white dove suddenly descended from the sky and entered into Jesus... It is symbolic. The white dove is a symbol of peace. No real dove descended from the sky and entered Jesus, but certainly an experience of pure whiteness suddenly descended in many people – like lightning striking. Whoever had eyes... and people with vision must have gathered. Who would bother? John is baptizing Jesus in the Jordan river, who cares? The thirsty must have gathered. Those who had tasted a few drops must have gathered. Those who had been spattered with a little color must have gathered. Those who had touched John’s red powder of festivity must have gathered. The must have seen something like a cluster of light descending from the sky and entering into Jesus... And John immediately said, “My work is finished. The one that I was waiting for has come. Now I can depart.”\nThis was the first experience of samadhi for Jesus. When the first experience of samadhi happens, the vibe spreads all around while its happening. It is said, when Buddha first experienced samadhi, flowers bloomed out of season. This is also a symbol, like the dove. The dove is the Jewish symbol – a symbol of peace. Flowers blooming is an Indian symbol – out of season, suddenly. Whenever anyone reaches samadhi... the flower of samadhi is always a flower out of season. On this earth when is there a season for samadhi to bloom? It is perfectly normal when samadhi doesn’t bloom on this earth. If samadhi blooms it is abnormal. This earth is a desert, where is there greenery here? Where does nectar flow? When it descends there are flowers out of season. It was not to be but it happened, it is a miracle! Samadhi is a miracle!\nYou will know it only when you experience it. Or perhaps staying near one who has experienced some day you will see a white dove descend or suddenly see flowers blooming.\nIn my courtyard, a white dove.\nA white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. Once in the delicate dusk of summer –\nI peeped into my courtyard.\nA few drops like the sprinkling of fragrant pandanus water in the body-mind of a new bride;\na rainbow gossamer on a maidens soft slender body\na white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. My hand painted with red mehendi lines, O heart –\nin the garden, trees blooming madly, a flute melody rings in my ear\nthe heart-longed-for guest has come home;\na thrill in my soul, a sparkle in my eye, sweet, sweeter\na white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. a beautiful golden dream –\nthe moon wrapped in a sari,\na song sleepily wandering, colliding with my breath;\nlike a sprinkling of jasmine, heart and soul perfumed\na white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. my restless song cries out in joy\nI am home, courtyard, threshold, door.\nLamps lighted, dusk falling\nlike the song of wedding reeds in the soul;\njuicy flower-like sounds spread in the mango groves,\na white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard.\nA white dove descends in the first experience of samadhi. Flowers bloom all around. A flute melody resounds. A reed begins to play inside. All vibrations, all tones are awakened.\na flute melody rings in my ear\nthe heart-longed-for guest has come home;\nThe awaited guest has come – the ‘atithi,’ the one with no date. In this country we have called the guest the atithi because he arrives without a set date. By now the only remaining atithi is god, all other guests set a date before coming. Now they send a message ahead that they are coming. They are saying that it is not right to suddenly shove their way in. We will be coming. Take care to prepare yourselves, because nowadays no one is happy to see a guest. If a message comes first then people can get ready. The cursing and swearing can be done earlier. What has to be said to the wife can be said. What has to be said to the husband can be said. By the time they arrive politeness has returned. If they suddenly come, who knows – the truth might come out! One has to say that it is a blessing, that seeing you our hearts are very delighted. This is not what is inside. Something else is inside. The Western custom of first informing is good so that people can get ready, can fortify their hearts.\nNow god is the only remaining atithi – he doesn’t fix a date. There is no prior indication of his coming. No one can say when the first experience of samadhi will happen. Spontaneously, out of season... The truth is what happens when you are not waiting, not expecting at all. As long as you are waiting you remain tense. Tension remains in your mind. While you are watching the path you can’t be total. Watching the path is also a thought and thought is the barrier. As long as you are thinking, “Now he will come”, it has not happened yet, you are still surrounded by thoughts. Clouds have gathered. How can the sun come out? It comes suddenly, spontaneously – when you are just sitting... not doing anything, not even meditating – then the first experience of samadhi happens. Even when you are meditating somewhere a desire remains in the mind – perhaps it will happen now, it must happen now. It hasn’t happened yet, it is overdue! Complaints go on arising.\nContinuing to meditate, meditating one day a moment happens when you are sitting, not even meditating, peaceful, just healthy, silently – and it comes!\na flute melody rings in my ear\nthe heart-longed-for guest has come home;\na thrill in my soul, a sparkle in my eye, sweet, sweeter my restless song cries out in joy\nI am home, courtyard, threshold, door.\nLamps lighted, dusk falling\nlike the song of wedding reeds in the soul;\njuicy flower-like sounds spread in the mango groves,\nIt happens. Don’t ask the definition. Ask the path. Ask how it happens, don’t ask what happens. It cannot be said. There is no way to talk about it. It is not something to be said, it is something to know. But the method can be told, indications can be given – move this way, be careful that way. When the mind is without thoughts, peaceful, empty of expectation, free of desire and longing – in that very moment. Whenever such a moment of spring is adorned within you the inner reed begins to play. Flowers bloom out of season. A ray descends from the sky and makes you forever different, changed. You can never become the same again. The first experience of samadhi – and you are bathed!\nYou have been dirty for centuries. Much dust of long journeys has gathered. The first experience of samadhi carries away all the dust. All beliefs, all traps of belief are finished. You become innocent.\nDid not Gorakh say it is like a small child is born within? – in the inner silence a child’s voice arises, a new arising of life.\nIn samadhi your death happens... DIE, O YOGI, DIE... The ego dies. You are destroyed and become the whole.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4 BELOVED MASTER,\nA MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.\nWHO WILL KEEP THESE THORNS?\nTHE GARDEN IS SILENT, THE GARDENER SILENT\nTHE QUESTION REMAINS SILENT IN ITSELF THE DAY IS SILENT, NIGHTS ARE SILENT JET BLACK CLOUDS HAVE ARISEN\nA COMPLETELY SILENT DARKNESS HAS COME. MASTER, PLEASE DISPEL THIS STATE.\nKannumal. As long as there are questions, answers will remain silent. It is because of the questions that answers are silent. The answer does not come from questions. When questions have gone and the mind has become free of questions, the answer comes. In a crowd of questions the answer is lost.\nYou are right: A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT. The answers\nwill remain silent. The questions are making such an uproar how should the answers speak? And remember questions are many, the answer is one. The answer is singular, questions are plural. There is a crowd of questions. Just as there are many illnesses, but health is one. There are not many kinds of health. If you tell someone you are healthy they don’t ask you what kind of health, which type of healthiness. But if you tell someone you are sick they immediately ask what you are sick with. Ilnesses are many, health is one. Questions are many, the answer is one. And because of these many questions you do not grasp the one answer. You are right, there is a crowd of questions. Question upon question in all directions... questions emerging from questions, arising, disappearing, made anew. You are surrounded by questions it is true. But this is the very reason the answer is silent.\nYou say, A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.\nThe answer is not silent. The answer too is speaking, but the answer is one and the questions are many. It is lost like a bird’s peep in the band room... It is lost like someone singing softly in a noisy bazaar.\nThe answer can be found. The answer is not far away. The answer is very near. You are the answer. The answer resides in your center. Let go of questions a little. Don’t give importance to questions. Don’t give much value to questions. Slowly slowly become disinterested in questions. Don’t encourage questions, don’t welcome them, ignore them. Be indifferent to questions. One who goes into questions strays off into the jungle of philosophy. Let questions come and go. Look at the crowd of questions like you look at people moving on the street – nothing to give, nothing to take – with detachment, standing far away... The more distance there is between you and your questions, the better. Because it is in this gap the answer will arise.\nWhenever someone came to Buddha, and asked questions, Buddha said, “Stop, stay here for two years. Stay near me in silence for two years, then ask.”\nOnce a great philosopher came to Buddha. His name was Maulungaputta. He was a well known philosopher. He had brought a mass of questions. Buddha listened to his questions and said, “Maulungaputta, do you really want the answer? If you really want it, can you pay the price?”\nMaulungaputta said, “The end of my life is coming near. My whole life I have been asking these questions. I received many answers but no answer has proved to be an answer. From every answer new questions have arisen. The solution was not in any answer. What price do you ask? I am ready to pay the full price. I want only to solve these questions. I want to leave this earth with these questions solved.”\nThen Buddha said, “Good. People also ask questions but are not ready to pay the price. This is why I asked you. Sit in silence for two years, this is the price. Sit near me in silence for two years without saying anything. When two years have passed, I myself will tell you, ‘Maulungaputta, now ask your questions.’ Then you can ask what you need to ask. And I promise that I will answer everything, I will dispel all doubts. But two years completely still and silent. Don’t bring it up for two years.”\nMaulungaputta was thinking whether to say yes or no. Two years is a long time and who knows if this man can be trusted, will he answer even after two years or not? He asked, “Do you give full assurance that you will answer after two years.\nBuddha said, “I give complete assurance, if you ask I will answer. But if you do not ask, who will I answer?”\nAt that time there was a disciple, a bhikshu, sitting in meditation under a tree nearby. He began laughing uproariously.\nMaulungaputta asked, “Why is this bhikshu laughing?” Buddha said, “You ask him.”\nThe bikshu said, “If you want to ask then ask now. I was deceived in the same way. He made a fool of me too. But he is telling the truth that if you ask after two years he will answer, but who asks after two years? I have sat silently for two years. Now he goes on prodding me, saying ask brother. But after two years of remaining silent nothing remains to be asked, the answer is received. If you want to ask, ask now, otherwise after two years nothing will be left to ask.”\nAnd this is exactly what happened, Maulungaputta stayed two years. When two years were over, Buddha did not forget, he remembered the exact date. Maulungaputta had forgotten when two years would be over because one whose thoughts have become slowly slowly quiet loses awareness of time. How to keep track of time, what day it is, what year it is! All was gone, all had flowed away. And what was the need? He would sit every day with the Buddha so Friday or Saturday, Sunday or Monday all were the same. June or July, hot or cold all were the same. Inside him there was only one vibe – of peace, of silence.\nTwo years were over. Buddha said, “Maulungaputta, stand up.”\nMaulungaputta stood up. Buddha said, “Now you can ask, because I don’t go back on my promise. Do you have something to ask?”\nMaulungaputta started laughing and said, “That bikshu was right. Now I have nothing to ask. The answer has come. Through your grace the answer has come.”\nThe answer has not been given but it is received. The answer does not come from outside, the answer comes from within. Think of it like digging a well. First rocks and gravel are removed, rubbish is removed, dry earth is removed then wet earth, then mud, then flowing water... The flowing water has been suppressed. The layers and layers of your questions have collected, the flowing stream is repressed beneath all this. Dig, push these questions aside. And there is only one way to push them aside: as a witness alertly watch this stream of questions. Just go on watching this stream, don’t do anything. Sit every day an hour or two, let the stream flow. Don’t be in a hurry to stop it today. This is why Buddha said two years. After some three months the first rustling of stillness begins. And as two years are over the experience ripens. Only if one has enough patience to sit two hours everyday, not doing anything... The whole art is hidden in this not doing anything.\nPeople ask: How did Buddha’s first samadhi happen? He was sitting under a tree, not doing anything, then it happened. For six years he did much – great control, exercise, breath control, who knows what all he did. He had gotten tired doing everything. That night he decided before sleeping, “Now there is nothing more to do, it is enough. Nothing happens from doing.” That night he stopped doing. That night he went to sleep in a complete state of non-doing, in a silent mood. In the morning he opened his eyes and samadhi was standing at the door. The guest he had been waiting for had come. The last star of dawn was disappearing and inside Buddha’s last thought disappeared. Outside the sky was emptied of the last star, inside the last thought dissolved. Samadhi came, the answer came. This is why it is called samadhi, because in it is the solution, the samadhan.\nDusk came, earth and sky became silent clouds of dust stirred up in the eyes\nthe eyelids blinked from the load, becoming moist. The dusk asked, why are you sad?\nI have no answer.\nNight came, engulfed in blackness\nin the thick dark the door of the mind opened in the fire, sparks began laughing.\nThe night asked, why this burning? I have no answer.\nSleep came, consciousness silent\nthe body tired and fell asleep, but the spirit explored magic-filled lanes of dream.\nSleep asked, why this forgetting?\nI have no answer.\nQuestions are scattered in every direction I have no answer.\nDon’t cling to questions or you will not find answers. No one has found the answer moving with the help of questions. Let questions arise, this is the itching of the mind. Itching is the right word. Sometimes you feel itchiness and you scratch it – just like this, questions are the itching of the mind. Nothing is solved by itching, but if you don’t ask you will also feel uncomfortable. By itching you get a little momentary relief – just like your answers. Grab onto one answer and get relief for a little while. Very soon questions will arise from this answer. Then relief will disappear, the search for the answer will begin again.\nKannumal, you are right:\nA MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.\nWHO WILL KEEP THESE THORNS?\nTHE GARDEN IS SILENT, THE GARDENER SILENT THE QUESTION REMAINS SILENT IN ITSELF\nTHE DAY IS SILENT, NIGHTS ARE SILENT JET BLACK CLOUDS HAVE ARISEN\nA COMPLETELY SILENT DARKNESS HAS COME. A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN,\nTHE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.\nThe answers will remain silent. Answers don’t speak. When you stop speaking, you will immediately encounter them. Your voice will disappear and you will find – emptiness speaks within you, silence speaks within you. Suddenly, in that silence is the solution, the answer to all the. In that silence is peace, is happiness, is the highest bliss.\nHave you noticed? Questions arise because of suffering. Suffering gives birth to questions. When you have a headache you ask why you have a headache. When you don’t have a headache you don’t ask why you don’t have one. When you are sick you go the the doctor and ask why you are sick What is the cause? But when you are healthy you don’t go the doctor and ask why you are healthy. What is its cause? No question arises in health, the question arises in illness. Questions arise from unhappiness, questions become weak in happiness.\nAs soon as you become peaceful inside and you get a glimpse of a little happiness, you will be surprised – questions disappear. Who asks, why ask? When the pain does not remain how can questions born of pain remain? They are finished by themselves.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 5\nWHAT IS PRAYER?\nPrayer is a state of gratitude. Prayer is thankfulness.\nGod has given so much, at the very least we can give thanks.\nPrayer is a preparation to welcome him. The guest will come, the guest will have to come. Decorate the house with flowers and boughs. String flower garlands. Prepare lamps of blessing. Prayer is a preparation to welcome. Who knows when the guest will come? I will be ready.\nSince I heard you will come to my door, each day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! O my life, look all around – the door, the threshold, the courtyard\nI have swept the whole house in your welcome; because your feet are delicate beloved,\nthe whole path is decorated with flower petals; since I heard you will come to my courtyard,\nI fill the whole street with festive spires and streamers. Ever since I heard you will come to my door,\neach day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! I had thought life a rather desolate place,\nI thought no song here was mine; never did a song\nburst forth from these strange lips;\never since I heard you will sing my song,\neach day I try out and bring new rhymes, new rhythms! Ever since I heard you will come to my door,\neach day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! In the eyes there is a festival of new dreams,\nthis seven-colored-wish smiles in my heart;\nhow can I cut the beautiful wings of imagination, the heart’s golden bird is restless;\never since I heard you will overwhelm my life, every day I dream bewitching dreams!\nEver since I heard you will come to my door,\neach day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! Standing at the crossroads I realize,\nI don’t know on which path you will come;\nthe world says I have become your mad woman, dark lover caress this madness;\never since I heard you will take an unknown path, I light lamps each day on every path!\nEver since I heard you will come to my door,\neach day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers!\nWhenever the guest will come, on whichever path he will come, from whichever door he will come, prayer is the preparation for his coming! Prayer is a mood of welcoming.\nDon’t fall into formal prayer. Let prayer be spontaneous, direct, arising from your heart, only then will it be meaningful. Not scriptural but heartful. Then even if it is babbling...\nYou have seen that when a small child starts babbling the first time how sweet its babbling is. Later when he starts to speak correctly perhaps no one will pay attention to him. But babbling is so sweet that the mother is delighted and calls everyone around to hear. He doesn’t say anything clearly yet. But when he starts speaking, no one bothers.\nIn the beginning prayer is like babbling. And remember a prayer that is babbled reaches to god, if it is from the heart, spontaneous, yours.\nWhom shall I befriend today?\nIn the sky with billowing dark clouds, imagination dances, becoming a peacock, feelings pull me towards them.\nTell me, with whom shall I flow? today, thirst is floating on my lips, the heart sitting, silent, sad,\nin the breath an agitated sigh,\nwill I remain in pain on the verge of death? The language of the eyes is unknown,\nmy song flying like a bird,\na great dilemma in the heart,\nshould I endure the remorse of helplessness? The hour of evening is impatient,\na gentle breeze dancing and turning, a suffocating pain rising\nwho to tell this lingering agony to? Whom shall I befriend today?\nTell me, with whom shall I flow?\nPrayer is a submission like this. Love is from the sky... No answer comes from another direction. This is why the prayer of one who waits for an answer will quickly cease. Don’t just wait for an answer, keep making your offering. Don’t be concerned whether he will answer or not, whether the matter reaches to him or not, don’t worry about all this. Don’t even try to use your prayer to change god. Just be concerned whether your prayer is going deeper. Is my prayer soaked with my tears, soaked with my bliss? Is the mark of my smile on my prayer? And is the signature of my spirit on my prayer? Just be concerned with this. And one day suddenly prayer reaches. Your babbling is heard.\nAnd in that moment in your temple of silence that child is born. That innocent consciousness enters. The white dove descends, the first glimpse of samadhi has come... it will come, it will certainly come.\nJesus has said, what has happened to me can happen to you. I say the same to you, what has happened to me can happen to you too. What has happened to one man is the birthright of all.\nEnough for today?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"13382","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/>Death is Divine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 The call of the unknown</h1><div class=post-meta>63 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;13382 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Death_is_Divine/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

which is in the process of being edited. It is for research only.]</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>EVERY TIME I COME HERE I RETURN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING SANNYAS. THE
DESIRE TO TAKE SANNYAS ARISES IN ME MANY TIMES, BUT I AM UNABLE TO
GATHER COURAGE TO DO IT. I GET SCARED THINKING, ’WILL I BE ABLE TO WALK
JOYFULLY UPON THIS PATH OR WILL I HAVE TO LEAVE THE PATH HALFWAY AND
THEN GO BACK?” BUT WHEN I PUT ASIDE THE IDEA OF TAKING SANNYAS, IT FEELS
MEANINGLESS TO MOVE IN THE WORLD WHERE I HAVE BEEN MOVING.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT SHOULD I DO? PLEASE, SHOW ME THE PATH.</p><p><br></p><p>Chandra Rekha, the new always seems to be frightening. The familiar
even if it is painful is still familiar. One is not afraid. One feels
safe with the known even if it is not joyful. One is well acquainted
with it. Before descending into the unknown, descending into the
unfamiliar, fear is quite natural. So don’t make a problem out of
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever someone steps forward on a new path he hesitates. But only
through stepping forward on the new is there growth in life. One who
keeps rotating in the old becomes a bullock in a grain mill. It is
always worth considering, “Am I blissful the way I am living?” If one is
not then one must take</p><p>risks. New paths, new life-styles, a new search will have to be
undertaken. This much is certain: you have nothing to lose. You did not
find bliss through your old life style. If you had there would be no
need for the new. The old has become meaningless, this much is certain.
The new can turn out to be meaningful or it can turn out to be
meaningless. But at least in the new there is a possibility of it being
meaningful. The old has been through the press. You have seen it,
understood it and lived it without receiving anything. As if one had
been trying to extract oil from sand. How long will you rack your brains
trying to get oil from sand?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not say that the new will definitely give you bliss, because
bliss is less dependent on the path that on the traveller, the one who
travels on it. Hence the real change is not in the path, the real change
is in the traveller. But to change paths is a beginning. You are
outside, so the transformation also has to begin from the outside. If
you gather courage to change the outside it will strengthen your courage
to change inside. And if a few drops of bliss start showering on you
then the search for the new will begin with joy and eagerness.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing is certain: you have nothing to lose. Don’t worry
unnecessarily. What have you achieved by holding on to the old? Nothing
can be lost. Then what is the fear if there is nothing to lose? Either
you will get something... At the most what can happen is that you will
also get nothing from the new. Then you will have to search anew.</p><p><br></p><p>Always look at it this way: the way I have lived, the way I have
thought, have I gotten anything from it or not? Think it over. Don’t
think what will be gained or won’t be gained in the future – the future
is unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is unknown. You will know it only by entering the experiment.
You will know only by tasting. Before tasting something how will you
decide whether it is tasty or not? You will have to trust somebody –
somebody who has tasted it.</p><p><br></p><p>You often visit here Chandra Rekha. I have tasted it and I say unto
you come forward, move ahead. And there are many here who are becoming
ecstatic, who are dissolving. Seeing their ecstasy, their dissolving,
the feeling for sannyas arises in your heart too. Otherwise why this
desire for sannyas ? Your heart is already vibrating, it is only your
mind that is hindering.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is always traditional. The heart is always eager to go with
the new and the head is always ready to stay tied to the old. The mind
has nothing except the past. Whatever the mind has is a treasure of
memories. It is all past. The mind has no future. Something becomes part
of the mind only when it has become the past. When you have experienced
something it becomes part of the mind. Mind lives in the past, in the
dead. So the mind is afraid of moving into the future. But the heart is
always ready to take the jump.</p><p><br></p><p>Your heart is full of rejoicing, your heart wants to take the step,
it is the mind which is cunning. The mind says, “Stop, think, first
decide: what if you move on the new path and still get nothing? What if
you have to return? What if you change your life style, take so much
trouble and still the reward is not worth it. Think a little, calculate,
figure it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if you listen to the mind you will never take the step.</p><p>Just think of a child still in the mother’s womb. He is about to be
born. If he has a mind, if intellect had already arisen it would say,
“Where are you going? This way of life, this living in the womb is so
comfortable. No troubles, no worries, no responsibilities: just sleeping
twenty-four hours a day. Where do you think you are going? Nobody knows
what is outside – what troubles will come, what challenges will
come.”</p><p><br></p><p>If a child has a little arithmetic, a little logic then no child will
ever be born from the mother’s womb. But there is no arithmetic,
arithmetic comes later – fortunately! Logic comes later. The child has
only heart, eager for the new, excited.</p><p><br></p><p>If we follow the intellect the earth will be full of senility. This
is what has happened to this country. People have tied themselves to
excessive intellectuality. Hence this country has become senile. This
country has lost its youth. It is living in ruins. It sings praises only
to the past. It has no enthusiasm for the new. It praises fallen yellow
leaves. It turns its back on the new shoots that are blooming. It
worships lifeless stones, the traces of the past. It has become a blind
believer. And everyone’s mind has become like this.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to gather courage.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say only this to you, even to be defeated with the new is a
victory and even to win with the old is defeat. Even if one gets
happiness with the old at the very most it means convenience. Even if
you suffer with the new it brings growth. The suffering received with
the new is the only asceticism. This is what I call asceticism. Sitting
with your body smeared with ash or lying down on a bed of nails or
fasting – I don’t call this asceticism. I call all these the idiocy of a
sick mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Asceticism is one – the courage to go with the new, the guts to
descend into the unknown! Just like a little baby leaving the mother’s
womb.</p><p><br></p><p>Just two days ago on a nearby tree a bird was raising her young. The
babies kept on growing day by day. Two days ago they came out of the
nest for the first time. When they came out of the nest, I was standing
nearby. Both of them settled on a branch – wonderstruck, trying their
wings, thinking should we go forward or not? They had never come out of
their nest before, and their mother was sitting on a distant tree giving
them a call, a loud call – this is how to call children.<span class=s4></span>she goes on</p><p>calling: hearing her call they flutter their wings. But the
attachment to the nest, safety<span class=s4></span>And they</p><p>have never before opened their wings<span class=s4></span>Should we
open them or not? Will we be able to fly or not?</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing their dilemma I was reminded of the dilemma of people newly
taking sannyas. They try their wings the same way, think it over, get
nervous, look back. But how long?</p><p><br></p><p>The mother kept on calling, kept on provoking, call after call. It
took about half an hour, slowly slowly they fluttered their wings, moved
a little further from the nest, sat on other branches of the same tree.
They felt a little more confident, flew a little in the air and came
back. Confidence grew further and then they flew away<span class=s4></span>They have not been seen since. For two days I have
been looking, but</p><p>they never came back. Why come back? The nest is left behind – two
egg shells left in it broken to pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Birds who have never flown before gather courage to fly into the sky,
but we have become human and still cannot gather courage.</p><p>I am calling you everyday, calling out loudly from a faraway tree.
This calling continues every day .</p><p><br></p><p>You say: EVERY TIME I COME HERE I RETURN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING
SANNYAS. THE DESIRE TO TAKE SANNYAS ARISES IN ME MANY TIMES, BUT I AM
UNABLE TO GATHER COURAGE TO DO IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Chandra Rekha, flutter your wings a little, get filled with the
thrill of the new, gather a little courage. You have wings. I call you
from the skies, I am giving you an invitation for the faraway. It is not
that you do not have wings. You have wings as much as I do, only you are
not confident. And how can you be confident? Fly and confidence
comes.</p><p><br></p><p>All I can say is, with the new even suffering is sweet. And a little
suffering will come with the new. Do you think those young birds who
flew away did not experience pain? Gusts of wind, rain in the night, now
they will have landed on some tree without their nest. Their wings will
have gotten wet. They must have shivered with cold. They may even have
thought to themselves, “Our nest was better, what trouble have we gotten
ourselves into?” But still the joy of flying in the sky is such that all
these prices can be paid. One must pay. And one who pays the price
attains.</p><p><br></p><p>A breeze heavy with fragrance And yet its feet are swift</p><p>What season is this?</p><p><br></p><p>When even pain feels intimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds unknown adding magic to the melody of the waves Fields shaded
by wintry clouds tossing flowers</p><p>My heart today out of control Sky soaked with songs</p><p>Who has bewitched my spirit? Even pain feels intimate</p><p>What are you saying, O wandering ray of sadness Why are you flowing
aimlessly through the mists? Love has a saying:</p><p>Fulfillment is love’s promise always A dream has awakened in my
eyes</p><p>Even pain feels intimate</p><p><br></p><p>Dusk willows through the fields heavy with full youth Like the song
of a reed only my solitary voice exists Solitude is beckoning</p><p>Piercing the body and heart What season is this?</p><p>When even pain feels intimate.</p><p><br></p><p>With the new, even pain is very intimate. With the old even
convenience and comfort are nothing but slow suicide. What is there to
leave behind? What will you lose? You have never gotten anything so what
have you got to lose?</p><p><br></p><p>Search and seek! And go on searching until you find. Until then do
not stop your feet, do not close your wings. No matter how afraid one
is, one has to try his wings, one has to fly into the sky. And the
challenge is already awake in you. How long will you deny it? How long
will you keep turning back?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t let this turning back become a habit. Don’t let this turning
back become your pattern. Before it becomes a habit, do something, wake
up a little, gather courage.</p><p><br></p><p>Should you wish to cross this roaring ocean</p><p><br></p><p>You must take life in your own hands and plunge into the waves. These
waves come to you travelling from places far away Bringing messages
afresh from that new world.</p><p>How much longer will you sit contemplating on the beach? Veenas
taking voice call you sweetly from that other shore. Should you wish new
life, new youth, new heart</p><p>Today you must embrace the swelling ocean with your arms. Set forth
today with new confidence</p><p>Lift up your eyes towards a new history. Let the old sky be left far
behind</p><p>Adorn your world with new sky today.</p><p><br></p><p>Should the voices of new creation resound in your spirit You must
dress anew every cell of your body.</p><p>This pain of annihilation will become sweet song of new creation This
darkness of night will become the benediction of the sun.</p><p>Let this ancient, ruined idol of the ages crumble now Any rock you
lay your hand on will become divine.</p><p>You are kin of the Himalaya, no matter what depth the ocean Today you
must contain the boundless sky in your wings.</p><p>Should you wish to cross this roaring ocean</p><p><br></p><p>You must take life in your own hands and plunge into the waves.</p><p><br></p><p>Plunge in! Even if you are afraid of drowning, plunge in. All new
swimmers feel the fear of drowning. One who has stopped on the bank out
of fear of drowning, will never be able to know the joys of swimming and
floating. And far away is the other shore – and that is the destination.
One has to go across, only then the meeting with the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is nothing but a small boat for crossing to the other shore.
It is true that the other shore is hidden in the mists, it is not
visible and this is why one has to join somebody who has eyes. This is
why one has to be close to somebody who has eyes, so that the melodies
fast asleep within you also become audible, so that the strings of your
veena are also struck.</p><p><br></p><p>Chandra Rekha, this is why you continue to come. This coming will
have no meaning if you don’t drown in this juice. Then it will be like
someone coming to the lake but always returning thirsty. The thirst is
not quenched just by coming to the lake, one has to cup his hands, bend
down, fill them with water and drink it, then the spirit will be
satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is the process of bending down, of cupping the hands. The
second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH NAMES AS TANTRA, VANMARG, AGHORPANTH,
AND NATHPANTH? IS THERE NO POSSIBILITY THAT THROUGH CORRECT ANALYSIS AND
RIGHT PRACTICE OF THESE PATHS, PEOPLE COULD UNDERSTAND THEM IN A NEW
PERSPECTIVE AND NOT CONDEMN THEM AND REMAIN OPPOSED TO THEM?</p><p>Taru has asked. And not just one, she has asked fourteen questions! I
had to count them. She has never done this before. There is some
connection with Gorakh... some sleeping memory has awakened, a waterfall
has gushed forth.</p><p><br></p><p>No one is new here, everyone is ancient. Who knows how many paths you
have travelled on. Who knows which masters you have been with. Your
coming to me is not accidental. You have been travelling, you have been
searching. This search has brought you here. Contact between me and
those who have never travelled, those who have never sought, happens
only with great difficulty. Even if they come, they stray off. Their
coming is accidental. There is no foundation stone beneath their coming.
Those who stick with me after they arrive, who stay around me – and Taru
has come and stayed – it means that a deep thirst of their being is
satisfied here. They have started getting a glimpse of what they had
sought through many many doors and could not get. They are getting close
to the destination.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have had some contact with Gorakh, Taru. You must have some
connection. Questions have burst forth from her gushing out like an
ancient sleeping song – and all of them are meaningful questions. None
of the questions are intellectual, they have not been asked for the sake
of asking: they arose. They have not been thought up because one should
ask: she could not refrain from asking! Then she must have become
afraid, because of asking fourteen questions. In the end she has asked
forgiveness, that I should not get angry with her. So many questions...
as if she were helpless, she had to ask, she couldn’t manage not to
ask.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one question of the fourteen: WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH
NAMES AS TANTRA, VANMARG, AGHORPANTH, AND NATHPANTH?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing, all these names are names for Tantra. One name for
Tantra is Vanmarg. Vanmarg means the path, the marg, of the left hand.
You have two hands, one right, one left. These two hands are not just
two hands, there are great mysteries behind them. Your right hand is
connected with the left part of your brain – crosswise. Your left hand
is connected with the right part of your brain. The brain is divided in
two halves. Now science has also made many investigations into this and
these investigations have revealed great secrets.</p><p><br></p><p>Your right brain, which is connected with the left hand, is the
source of poetry, of experiencing, of feeling, of art, of wisdom, bliss,
ecstasy, dance, music, celebration, imagination. Whatever is sweet,
whatever is feminine, whatever is beautiful, the birth of all of this is
in your right brain. The left hand indicates the right brain.</p><p><br></p><p>Your right hand is connected with the left brain. In the left brain
arise logic, mathematics, activity, efficiency, cunning, politics,
diplomacy, the world, prose, science, accounting, utility, the market –
all these are connected with the left brain.</p><p><br></p><p>The world has always put emphasis on the right hand, because in the
right hand is utility, expediency, mathematics, logic, the market, the
shop, practicality. The left hand has appeared dangerous, has always
appeared dangerous. How can one trust a poet? A mathematician can be
trusted. How can one trust a dancer? A scientist can be trusted. But
science is useful, what is the use of dance? Dance is self
enjoyment.</p><p>The left hand is the symbol of your inner enjoyment. It has no goal.
It has no direction. It is not going anywhere. It is just the art of
living this very moment in a blissful, charmed, ecstatic way.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the value of poetry? It can neither feed your stomach, nor
cover your body, nor make a roof over your head. So we give poets only a
little respect, in a certain proportion, like they are a decoration but
not necessary. We can tolerate one man becoming a poet in society, but
we will not tolerate a group of them, because a poet does not seem to be
of any use. What is his utility?</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Picasso, “What is the utility of your paintings?”</p><p><br></p><p>Picasso hit his forehead. He said, “You don’t ask flowers what their
utility is. And the cuckoo sings and you don’t ask her what her utility
is. And when the sky is filled with stars you don’t ask them what their
utility is. Why ask only me?”</p><p><br></p><p>Poets and painters, sculptors and musicians, they have always been
saying they have no utility. And life does not end with utility.
Remember the words of Jesus: “Man cannot live by bread alone.” He needs
something more, he needs something more than bread. Bread is necessary
but not sufficient. There can be no poetry without bread, it is true,
but if there is just bread without poetry then living and not living are
almost identical. Every day stuffing your stomach, living and finally
dying. If no poetry has awakened, if no song arises, if no veena is
played, if no music ever flowers on the flute, what meaning is
there?</p><p><br></p><p>“Svanthah sukhaya ragunatha gatha – the song of the supreme is of
self enjoyment.” One who is filled with self contentment is the one who
becomes filled with love for that ultimate beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why the left hand has always been a sign of danger. So we
call those who we are afraid of Vanmargi – ‘leftist’.</p><p><br></p><p>You will find thousands who call me a Vanmargi. They are right. I am
a Vanmargi, a ‘leftist’, because I am teaching you the art of Svantah
sukhaya – of self enjoyment.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathematics is not everything. There is a world beyond mathematics
and that world brings fulfillment, there is contentment in that world,
there is light in that world.</p><p><br></p><p>The necessities should be taken care of, it is true. But what else?
When basic needs are fulfilled, what else will you do? This problem has
arisen today in the West, because needs are fulfilled. The West has
taken care of all the outer necessities. Try to understand the
difficulty. The right brain, connected with the left hand, was not used
in fulfilling the basic needs. The West denied religion, denied poetry,
denied music, denied all dimensions of mystery. The West is living only
on mathematics, science, matter: things which have solid proof. A
continuous application for three hundred years, the application of the
right hand, has made the West affluent. There is money, wealth, housing,
beautiful roads, delicious and abundant food, everything is more than is
needed. An age of affluence has dawned in the West. But it has come
through three hundred years of continuous denial of the source of self
enjoyment – of Svantah sukhaya.</p><p><br></p><p>So the West has become rich, now what? Because they have lost the art
of enjoying happiness, the West is dumbfounded. Where to go now? What to
do? Whatever the world of work can accomplish</p><p>is already complete. There is great uneasiness in the West. Western
man is unable to even take Sunday as a holiday. The very habit of taking
holidays has been forgotten. Work and work and work... So much emphasis
has been placed on work that work is made into a god. Hence the art of
play has been forgotten. Sitting gossiping and laughing, or playing on
the strings of a veena, or growing grass in the garden, or lying down
under the stars in ecstasy, or going out in a boat... No, all these are
without meaning. For three hundred years only one thing has been taught
and repeated from kindergarten to university: the value of work.</p><p><br></p><p>So today if someone is lying down in his boat just floating under the
starry sky, he feels as if he is committing a sin: “Work is virtue, so I
am committing sin.” A feeling of guilt has become associated with
moments of happiness. Whenever you become happy, you feel as if you are
doing something wrong. What are you doing humming a song? You want to
suppress the song in your throat. What will you get from it? Logic comes
up, calculations arise – what’s in it for you? what is its benefit? Why
are you playing the flute? Do some work.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and say, “You are teaching people meditation? What
will meditation accomplish? Teach work.”</p><p><br></p><p>Work has utility. And I do not say to drop work. But I want to say to
you that the use of work is that you can be blissful in the non-work
moments. The use of work is that you can be free of work. The six days
that you work hard in the market are so that on the seventh day you can
leisurely stretch out your legs, you can lie down in the sun, or sit
down in the shade of a tree, or talk with the flowers, or gossip with
the moon and stars, or sing an ecstatic song, or tie ankle bells on your
feet, and dance! This is the goal of striving for six days. And if five
days work is enough, work only five days, dance for two days. If four
days work is enough, then three days... go on reducing this way. Work
has to go on being reduced. Leisure has to go on being increased.
Leisure, is the aim.</p><p><br></p><p>Insanity starts creeping into the life of anyone who has no rest, no
meditation. The moment work is over they don’t know what to do. There is
a reason many people are going mad in the West, it has a reason: the
days of work are over, that job is accomplished. They thought work was
life, now they don’t understand life and what more it can be.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason many people are committing suicide is the same. What is
the point of living now? One has accumulated wealth penny by penny, how
long can you go on accumulating? He has forgotten why he was
accumulating wealth. He was accumulating wealth so that at some moment
he could sit down leisurely, with no worries. He forgot, because only
one part of the brain was used in accumulating. That part has been
active, and the other half which has not been used, has slowly slowly
filled with dust.</p><p><br></p><p>Vanmarga means the aim of life is not work but rest. The goal of life
is not money but meditation. The goal of life is not mathematics but
poetry. The highest peak of life is not attained through science, it is
attained through religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Vanmarg has always been a word of condemnation. And it was natural in
the past, there were other reasons then. The further back you go the
more the world was poor, means were not available. It seems only natural
that in those days of poverty people made work very significant, gave it
great value. And if the people who gave value to leisure in place of
work were opposed by the society it is</p><p>not at all surprising. But this ancient habit has remained with us
like a complex in our minds – even now we are afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>The mathematical, the calculating mind is opposed to enjoying taste –
it is always against everything which gives rise to happiness inside
you. It goes on fulfilling the vow of no-taste. It is against beauty, it
can make ugliness spiritual. It is against health also, because health
is bodily happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>A famous German thinker, Count Keyserling, wrote in his journal after
traveling in India, “Going to India I experienced that sickness is
spiritual and health is unspiritual, because health is of the body.”
This is why a spiritual person will not take joy in good health. He is
the enemy of the body. This is why the world has become the enemy of
love, because love is great happiness. We have trained ourselves to be
against all these things.</p><p><br></p><p>Vanmarg, the left hand path, has given the opposite message. Vanmarg
says: Love is prayer and love is the ultimate. And Vanmarg says nothing
is to be dropped because whatever the ultimate has given can be used.
Use it, and make it a step. Transform it into a step of the temple of
the ultimate. Don’t take it as a stone on the path, don’t take it as a
hindrance. Make steps and climb up. Make even sex a step, don’t oppose
it either.</p><p><br></p><p>The amazing message of Vanmarg is, that if you are intelligent you
can use even poison in such a way that it becomes medicine. If you are
an idiot you will make even medicine into poison. This is the
fundamental sutra of Vanmarg: the intelligent makes even poison into
medicine. This is intelligence. Escapists are cowards, not intelligent.
Vanmarg will not run away.</p><p><br></p><p>Escapists have been very respected in the world. The reason is, when
you look at an escapist you begin to think he is more special than you.
You are mad after money and someone has kicked away his money and gone
to the jungle, you are immediately impressed. You are impressed because
you are so infatuated with money and this man certainly has a quality,
he has kicked it away. This is why you are more impressed by Mahavira
than by the enlightened King Janak. Janak’s name is rarely heard. You
are more impressed by Buddha because he renounced the royal palace. If
you praise Krishna you do it in a quiet voice, a little frightened, a
little nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if people praise Krishna they praise the Krishna of the Geeta.
Very few people have the courage to accept all of Krishna. Because
Krishna seems to be just like you, or rather a little worse than you.
You somehow explain to yourself, okay he was God, he must have done it,
he must have danced with his girlfriends. But this man Krishna is not
given his full splendor. You may want to avoid calling him god. You look
for an excuse. Your mind begins to be troubled. You start feeling
uneasy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a visitor at someone’s house – at a Hindu family. It was a
respectable family, a high caste family. It happened ten or twelve years
ago. My book, “From Sex to Samadhi” had been published. The man was very
upset. He said, “You should at least have given it another title. When
someone reads the book he will find out what is really in it, but this
title is very dangerous. You should give it some other name.” Also on
the first edition there is a picture of the ecstatic Tantra statues from
the temples of Khajuraho printed on the cover. He said, “What got into
your mind? If this is the title it should have a picture of Buddha in a
state of meditation on the cover... but statues of Khajuraho? Later when
someone actually reads the book, he will be very upset seeing all
this.”</p><p>I was sitting in their living room, I said as I looked at their
wall... They had hung a big picture of Krishna in which he has stolen
the clothing of naked women who are bathing in the river. And he is
sitting in a tree. I said, “You keep this picture in your living room?”
He looked up, he stopped for a moment. Perhaps he had never looked at
the picture in this way. He said, “You are right. That picture has been
hanging there since my father’s time. And sometimes I am a little
embarrassed, but no one pays any attention to it. Because this is God,
he must be doing right. We have accepted it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But when I went to his house again, the picture had been removed. I
asked him, “What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No. Since the day you pointed it out, I have been aware of
it. I began to be very upset and thought it better to remove the
picture. So I disposed of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even your acceptance of Krishna is incomplete. You want to select and
cut many things. You are always ready to make revisions of Krishna.
People believe in Krishna according to their own understanding. They
believe as much as they can believe, rejecting the rest. What is the
problem? The problem is, that it is clear to you that Mahavira appears
to be moving opposite from you. You can respect him because you know
your greed, your lust, your anger, your ardent desire, and he has
renounced all of this. He is special, now there is no need for proof,
but Krishna? He is standing right in the same world where you are!</p><p><br></p><p>To recognize Krishna one needs eyes of great depth. To recognize
Mahavira is within the powers of even a blind man, there is no problem.
A blind man too can recognize, yes, Mahavira has renounced everything.
But until the inner eye has opened it is difficult to recognize Krishna,
because he is standing right here, there is no difference. There is no
difference from the outside, there is a difference from the inside. So
as long as you have no ability to see within, you will not be able to
understand Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is a Vanmargi, a ‘leftist’. This is why the Jainas have
thrown Krishna into hell. In their scriptures they threw him into hell.
He is a Vanmargi. What could be more Vanmarg? A natural acceptance of
life, an eager acceptance, a welcome acceptance... The ability to live
life in its total creativity, courage... There is nothing bad in life.
If there are thorns, they are there ready to protect the flower.
Whatever exists in life is beautiful. And if there is anything we cannot
see the beauty of then somehow it is our mistake. How can the ultimate
make something ugly? The ultimate is manifest in all forms. In lust too
the ultimate is hidden – in kama too Rama is hidden. Very few people can
muster such courage. They don’t have this broad a vision.</p><p><br></p><p>Taru this is why people are afraid of names like Tantra, Vanmarg,
Aghorpanth, Nathpanth. It is because they will shatter your established
conventions. These beautiful names have become swear words. If people
call someone a Vanmargi then the matter is finished. Such and such man
is a Vanmargi – means you have totally repudiated him, now there is no
need for refutation. Now there is no need to go further into his
arguments: what he says, why he says it. You have labelled him Vanmargi,
now the man is finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghorpanth. A beautiful word like aghor has become an abuse! If you
call someone an Aghorpanthi he will be ready to fight. People call
someone an Aghori when they want to insult him.</p><p>Do you know the real meaning of the word aghor? Aghor means easy,
simple, direct. If you call someone ghori it could be an insult. Ghor
means complicated, terrible, dense. When there is a really terrible war
then people say ghor-ghamaasaan – terribly fierce. Ghor means
complicated, messed up... Aghor means simple childlike innocence. But
people say it when they want to insult. People say Morarji Desai is an
Aghori because he drinks his own urine – innocent? It means they are are
insulting him.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghor can be used only for a few Buddhas. Gautam Buddha is an Aghori,
Krishna is an Aghori, Christ is an Aghori, Lao Tzu is an Aghori. It can
only be used for such people. Gorakh is an Aghori. Simple, innocent,
straightforward... So simple that there is no opportunism in his life.
The very mode of manipulating is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who you call religious are also calculative. They look to see
if they have done enough fasting to go to heaven, or are they fulfilling
enough vows to go to heaven, or have they given enough charity to go to
heaven? This is all calculation. This charity is part of the market.
This charity is business, a trade. Sin is hidden in this virtue. The
meaning of Aghor is: simple, direct – one whose opportunism is finished,
who lives like children live. Aghor is the highest state, the state of a
paramahansa. But unfortunately these have become swear words.</p><p><br></p><p>Nathpanth: because of Gorakhnath and Gorakh’s master Macchindranath
this branch of Tantra began to be called Nathpanth. It’s feeling is very
lovely. The meaning of Nath is master, lord. What the Sufis call, “Ya
Malik.” Everything is his, the master’s, the lord’s. We too are the
master’s, the world too is his, everything is his. We live according to
his wish. We live as he would have us live. We will not project our own
will. We will not live by effort. We will flow as one flows in the
current of a river, we will not swim. This is the feeling. As long as he
is the master why should we bring our will in between? If our will
comes, then our ego comes, if our ego comes then we are lost. So we will
live without ego, as he wills...</p><p><br></p><p>As dry leaves fly in the wind, whether they go east or west, north or
south, wherever the wind carries them there is no worry. No fight, no
resistance, they do not struggle to go west, saying they will not go to
the east, why are you taking us east? No, what will do leaves have? A
Nathpanthi is one in whom this has happened. Gorakh was like this. He
lived in this spontaneous acceptance. He lived in this simplicity. But
people live by the ego. The language of life of most people in the world
is the language of ego. Naturally, such simple people cannot be
tolerated. Others will feel a great danger with such people. If they
start living so simply others feel what will happen to morality?
Immorality will spread – as if there were morality now.</p><p><br></p><p>These are very strange ideas. People talk as if there were justice
now, then injustice would spread. Where is justice? What kind of
justice? Hypocrisy in the name of morality. People are wearing false
masks, people are wearing counterfeit masks. Where is morality?</p><p><br></p><p>But people understand that if everyone begins to be simple, begins to
live easily, begins to live naturally and say it is the will of the
ultimate then morality will be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact is the opposite. People have become immoral by continually
living by will. Who on this earth is more immoral than man? Who on this
earth is more violent than man? Who on this earth murders his own kind
more than man? Birds and animals at least don’t kill their own species.
No</p><p>lion kills and eats lions. No hawk attacks hawks. Man is the only
animal on this whole earth who murders his own species. And not just a
few – thousands, millions! Such joy in killing! And strangely this too
is dressed up in the attire of law. Muslims call it a jihad: Christians
call it a crusade. It is a holy war, so kill. Then there is no harm, the
more you kill the better. The more you kill the more certain heaven
is.</p><p><br></p><p>People fight jihads, fight crusades for centuries. They go on
butchering each other in the name of God. Butcher them, in anyone’s
name. Sometimes butcher in the name of politics, sometimes in the name
of religion, sometimes in the name of sects, sometimes in the name of
scripture. These are all excuses, the object is killing. Without killing
the mind will not be satisfied. What kind of mankind have we given birth
to? What kind of sick minded man have we given birth to?</p><p><br></p><p>People are burning with sex desire. There is nothing besides sex
inside of them. They sit repressing it. This is why whenever anyone says
to them, accept sex naturally, it is a divine gift, there is great
turmoil inside of them. Because they know that if they naturally accept
sex everything will be disturbed. They have repressed so much there is a
volcano burning under them. How can they accept it naturally?</p><p><br></p><p>Think of it as if someone has fasted his whole life, he goes on dying
of hunger and you come and say to him, “Friend, accept your hunger
naturally. When you feel hunger, eat.” He will completely freak out. He
will say, “If I accept it naturally then I will never get out of the
kitchen, because I know myself, I know I am thinking of food twenty four
hours a day.” A fasting man thinks only of food twenty four hours a day.
“... so I will not be able to get out of the kitchen. I will be stuck
sitting there.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised at what he is saying – people who enjoy food
don’t sit twenty four hours a day in the kitchen. But understand what
this man is saying, this poor man is also right. He thinks of food
twenty four hours a day, one who fasts thinks of nothing but food.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why when someone like me speaks of living spontaneously
people are very nervous, they are very afraid. Sometimes repressed types
of people come here, and they are frightened. Because they know that if
what I am saying is right, then the disease repressed within them will
immediately be revealed, their life long repressed disease will
immediately manifest. They will become insane. They will not be able to
endure it. To save themselves from this predicament they go against me,
they become opposed to me.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a reason for opposing me. The truth of what I am saying
appears so dangerous to them – it appears dangerous not because truth is
dangerous. It appears dangerous, because until now they have lived in so
much untruth that now it seems very difficult to drop untruth. And if it
drops then what they have held together their whole life will
break...</p><p><br></p><p>In their life they do not have self restraint, only a false
insistence on self restraint. That man is truly disciplined who has
become aware and has wholly transcended his sex desire. To him it
doesn’t make any difference. He will not find any objection at all to
what I say. Those who take objection to what I say are only indicating
their diseased minds, but they think they are saying something against
me.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great movement opposing Freud all over the world. But
Freud was speaking simple straightforward truths of life. Freud is a
Vanmargi. Freud suggested to let repressed impulses flow</p><p>again. He was opposed throughout the word, all the religions opposed
him. You opposed him because the ground beneath you was slipping. You
will all be wrong if Freud is right. And it is better if you go on
proving yourself right. And the crowd is yours. The crowd is with you.
Truth is always alone. Untruth is very ancient. The crowd is happy with
it. The crowd has given it company for so long. All the vested interests
of the crowd have become joined with it. You are completely freaked out,
you have become completely frightened. In your fear, in your freak out
you start opposing. But truth is not defeated this way, truth returns
again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Vanmarg goes on returning again and again. Tantra will be proclaimed
again and again, until man becomes spontaneous. The day man becomes
spontaneous will be the day Tantra is no longer needed. Tantra is only
medicine. Vanmarg, the left handed path, is only a means to bring people
to the path who have gone off the other side. One who is come on the
path is neither on the right nor on the left. Both left and right are
his. He does not belong to either. His state is of transcendence. He has
gone beyond both.</p><p><br></p><p>You have asked: WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCH NAMES AS TANTRA,
VANMARG, AGHORPANTH, AND NATHPANTH?</p><p><br></p><p>There is reason to fear. You have such a load of gunpowder inside of
you that a tiny spark of truth and you will explode. How can you not be
afraid of sparks? When you are ready to drop your gunpowder you will no
longer have any fear of sparks. You are afraid of that which makes you
uneasy inside. And truth makes you very uneasy. If you have made a
continuing connection with untruth, if you have wedded yourself to
untruth, truth will upset you very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin got married. As is the Muslim custom, on the
honeymoon the bride lifted her veil in front of Mulla, opened her
‘burqa’. It was the first time Mulla had seen her, he had not seen her
previously. He was very disappointed. He had never seen a more ugly
faced woman in his life! According to the custom, the bride asked
“Before whom can I remove the veil?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla replied, “You can remove it before anyone, just don’t open it
in front of me. Remove it in front of the whole world, remove it in
front of anyone you want to, just don’t remove it in front of me. If
this burqa remains down now it is better.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are afraid of this ugliness. You have veiled yourself, you don’t
remove it. You become angry with whoever removes your veil, whatever
shows your dirtiness. You become angry with whoever shows your rubbish
within. And the master has to show you your inner rubbish. If you don’t
see it how will you become free of it? If you are not liberated from the
inner sense of worthlessness that is riding in your chest you will sink
into it. You will drown in it. It will cause your drowning. The rocks
you have bound to your chest have to be removed. Although you think they
are philosopher’s stones, they are drowning you.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever there is a new declaration of truth there are waves of
unrest in all direction where untruth has spread its nets. Cut the
throat of truth, poison the truth, silence the voice of truth – all
these kinds of efforts start being made. And there is no reason to be
angry about it. It is completely natural. It is a matter for compassion,
a matter for kindness.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said to his disciples, “The people that you go to teach are
the ones who will harm you. Out of kindness you go on giving truth and
they will throw stones at you. So don’t be angry. They are</p><p>helpless: what can they do? You have come to destroy the truth they
had believed for centuries. You have started shaking their house. They
thought this house was their security. You have started knocking down
their walls. You have started lifting their veils and showing their
ugliness. They will be angry.</p><p><br></p><p>One disciple – Purna – used to to on pilgrimage, taking the Buddha’s
message. Buddha asked, “Where are you going?”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a part of Bihar called Sukha. He said, “None of your
sannyasins have gone to Sukha yet, I will go there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “It would be good if you don’t go there. The people of
that area are dangerous, this is why no one has gone. If they insult you
what will happen to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Purna replied, “If they insult me then I will consider myself
fortunate that they didn’t beat me, they only insulted me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “And if they beat you what will happen to you
Purna?”</p><p><br></p><p>Purna replied, “I will consider myself fortunate that they didn’t
kill me, they only beat me.” Buddha said, “One more question, if they
kill you what will happen to you as you are dying?”</p><p>Purna replied, “What else could happen? These are such good people
that they have released me from living in this body in which I might
have committed some mistake. Now no mistake is possible. They have
released me from living in this body where my foot may have gone on
wrong paths, anything could happen, I could stray off. They have
liberated me from this body. I will die filled with kindness for them. I
will die full of gratitude for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Then you go. Go anywhere. Wherever you go, you will
find your friend, because now you cannot see any enemy.” It is not that
by closing eyes there are no enemies. But one who no longer sees enemies
is one who can declare the truth. Enemies will arise, enemies will
immediately arise. The truth always gives rise to enemies. Do we have
enough understanding that we can stomach the truth? Do we have a big
enough heart to allow the truth to permeate us? ... to make it a guest
inside us? If we can let ourselves be a host to truth, let truth be a
guest... but do we have this capacity? This is why it goes on happening,
insults continue, opposition continues, but truth goes on making its
declaration again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say unto you, that truth comes from the right half of the
brain, connected with the left hand. Calculation comes from the left
half of the brain, which is connected with the right hand. A calculative
person can never accept poetry. A person who thinks money and wealth are
valuable cannot understand the value of meditation. And one for whom
business is everything cannot be in the temple. And if he goes to the
temple, the temple is corrupted by him.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question: Question 3</p><p>WHAT IS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SAMADHI LIKE?</p><p><br></p><p>You will know only if it happens. It is not that it can be said. A
few indications can be given. A lamp is suddenly alight in the dark - it
is like this. Or like a sick man dying and suddenly the medicine
works... nearing death the medicine works and suddenly ripples of life,
the thrill of life spreads again – it is just like this. Like a corpse
has come to life – the first experience of samadhi is like this.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an experience of immortal nectar. It is an experience of the
ultimate music. But it happens only when it happens. And only if it
happens will you be able to understand. You will not be able to
understand from my saying it. It is like being in love. Who can explain
it to anyone? One who has not loved, one who does not know love, no
matter how times you try racking your brains, how much you explain – he
will listen to everything, but he will still say I don’t understand a
thing. Please explain a little more.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like trying to explain light to the blind, or sound to the deaf
– they will not be able to understand. One whose nostrils are damaged,
who cannot smell anything, how will you explain the experience of
fragrance? Experience cannot be put into words, but a few indications
can be given.</p><p><br></p><p>Songs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings. the lingering
ache of the heart was</p><p>molded by devotions, nurtured by imagination; the path was unknown to
me,</p><p>I had not yet gone on it, the narrow lane of love;</p><p>but steps suddenly went forward, and the heart also went ahead;</p><p>all illusions from folk tradition crashed down in one moment! Songs
awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings.</p><p>That sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised,
gratefully;</p><p>I cannot say: was it victory for the heart, or defeat? the agony was
tender;</p><p>the voice remained silent, but</p><p>the secret of the heart was out;</p><p><br></p><p>these eyes have said all I didn’t want to say,</p><p><br></p><p>Songs awakened in spirit, but flowed out in feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>What imagination had tendered I found right in front of me, that
moment also came;</p><p>that beautiful image overwhelmed my heart, the mind enchanted, too
shy to look;</p><p>when I could come around I was lost in myself</p><p>and now my spirit remains quite completely lost! Songs awakened in
spirit, but flowed out in feelings.</p><p>Like a song, suddenly awakening in your heart. Like suddenly, an
uncaused cascade of juice bursting forth spontaneously within you.</p><p><br></p><p>the path was unknown to me, I had not yet gone on it,</p><p>the narrow lane of love;</p><p><br></p><p>And suddenly love awakens... the first experience of samadhi is like
this. As if it were autumn and suddenly spring comes! And where trees
standing dry and barren become green, loaded with leaves, abloom with
flowers – the first experience of samadhi is like this.</p><p><br></p><p>but steps suddenly went forward,</p><p><br></p><p>And feet unexpectedly step forward in one when love has awakened or
when light has arisen, or when one has heard the inner sound. Then fear
does not grip one. One lets go of all fear when love has awakened. This
is why mathematical, calculating people say love is blind – because the
lover goes where people with eyes are afraid to go. Where people with
eyes say, Be careful! Take care! Protect yourself. Don’t get into
trouble! – the lover enters there dancing and singing.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why so called intelligent people say love is blind. The
reality is just the opposite. No one is blinder than the intelligentsia.
Only a lover has eyes. If love is not eyes, then what are eyes?</p><p><br></p><p>the path was unknown to me,</p><p>I had not yet gone on it, the narrow lane of love;</p><p>but steps suddenly went forward, and the heart also went ahead;</p><p>all illusions from folk tradition crashed down in one moment!</p><p><br></p><p>The first experience of samadhi is like this. All previous beliefs,
all previous convictions, all previous sects and scriptures, flow away
like a river in the first spate of rain that carries off all the rubbish
left along its banks.</p><p><br></p><p>That sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised,
gratefully;</p><p>Yes, you will remain standing in wonder. You will not be able to
comprehend what is happening. Thoughts will stop. There is no
opportunity to think. Something has happened beyond comprehension.</p><p><br></p><p>That sweet hour was sweet mimicry of anticipation, I was surprised,
gratefully;</p><p>I cannot say: was it victory for the heart, or defeat?</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to say – who won, who lost? Now there are not two,
this is why it is right to say won, right also to say lost. In one sense
lost because one is obliterated. In another sense won because one has
become the whole. In one sense the drop is defeated because it is
obliterated, in another sense victorious because the drop has become the
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot say: is it victory for the heart, or defeat? the agony was
tender;</p><p>But this much is sure that the misery was very lovely, very sweet.
Hasn’t Gorakh said, ... SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND
SAW. It is very sweet and lovely, a death very sweet and lovely!</p><p><br></p><p>What imagination had tendered I found right in front of me,</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is whatever you have imagined appears small when it faces
the truth. You get much more that what you asked. When it comes, it
comes crashing through the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>that moment also came;</p><p>You could not believe it would come. It comes. that moment also
came;</p><p>that beautiful image overwhelmed my heart, the mind enchanted, too
shy to look;</p><p>One cannot believe, how can I deserve this? – that I meet the
beloved, that the union with the beloved could happen.</p><p><br></p><p>when I could come around</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t manage to say anything, not even two words of
welcome...</p><p><br></p><p>I was lost in myself</p><p><br></p><p>and now my spirit remains quite completely lost!</p><p><br></p><p>The first experience of samadhi is like being completely lost,
missing, as if completely plundered... One doesn’t know if defeated or
victorious. But it is certain that the limits are broken, confinements
are broken – the whole sky has descended. Kabir has said, “The ocean has
disappeared in the drop...” The limitless has entered the limited, the
unseen into the seen... The invisible present in what was already
visible.</p><p><br></p><p>The first experience of samadhi is the most valuable experience of
this universe. And then there is experience after experience, lotus
after lotus goes on blooming. Then there is no end, then lotuses go on
blooming in a continuous series. It never happens that the experience of
samadhi becomes less, it just goes on increasing. This is why god is
called infinite, because the experience is never completed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is described in the life of Jesus that when John the Baptist –
John too was a remarkable man – initiated Jesus... John was Jesus’
master. He took Jesus to the Jordan river to baptize, to initiate by
water. A great crowd had gathered because John had been saying, “The man
I am waiting to baptize is coming, he’ll be coming very soon, he has
almost arrived.” So a great crowd had gathered to see him. And when
Jesus came John said, “The man I have been waiting to baptize has come.
Now my work is done. Now he will take care of everything. I am already
old...”</p><p><br></p><p>When he initiated Jesus in the river Jordan the story says a very
beautiful thing – it is symbolic – that a white dove suddenly descended
from the sky and entered into Jesus... It is symbolic. The white dove is
a symbol of peace. No real dove descended from the sky and entered
Jesus, but certainly an experience of pure whiteness suddenly descended
in many people – like lightning striking. Whoever had eyes... and people
with vision must have gathered. Who would bother? John is baptizing
Jesus in the Jordan river, who cares? The thirsty must have gathered.
Those who had tasted a few drops must have gathered. Those who had been
spattered with a little color must have gathered. Those who had touched
John’s red powder of festivity must have gathered. The must have seen
something like a cluster of light descending from the sky and entering
into Jesus... And John immediately said, “My work is finished. The one
that I was waiting for has come. Now I can depart.”</p><p>This was the first experience of samadhi for Jesus. When the first
experience of samadhi happens, the vibe spreads all around while its
happening. It is said, when Buddha first experienced samadhi, flowers
bloomed out of season. This is also a symbol, like the dove. The dove is
the Jewish symbol – a symbol of peace. Flowers blooming is an Indian
symbol – out of season, suddenly. Whenever anyone reaches samadhi... the
flower of samadhi is always a flower out of season. On this earth when
is there a season for samadhi to bloom? It is perfectly normal when
samadhi doesn’t bloom on this earth. If samadhi blooms it is abnormal.
This earth is a desert, where is there greenery here? Where does nectar
flow? When it descends there are flowers out of season. It was not to be
but it happened, it is a miracle! Samadhi is a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>You will know it only when you experience it. Or perhaps staying near
one who has experienced some day you will see a white dove descend or
suddenly see flowers blooming.</p><p><br></p><p>In my courtyard, a white dove.</p><p><br></p><p>A white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. Once in the
delicate dusk of summer –</p><p>I peeped into my courtyard.</p><p><br></p><p>A few drops like the sprinkling of fragrant pandanus water in the
body-mind of a new bride;</p><p>a rainbow gossamer on a maidens soft slender body</p><p><br></p><p>a white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. My hand
painted with red mehendi lines, O heart –</p><p>in the garden, trees blooming madly, a flute melody rings in my
ear</p><p>the heart-longed-for guest has come home;</p><p><br></p><p>a thrill in my soul, a sparkle in my eye, sweet, sweeter</p><p><br></p><p>a white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. a beautiful
golden dream –</p><p>the moon wrapped in a sari,</p><p>a song sleepily wandering, colliding with my breath;</p><p>like a sprinkling of jasmine, heart and soul perfumed</p><p><br></p><p>a white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard. my restless
song cries out in joy</p><p>I am home, courtyard, threshold, door.</p><p><br></p><p>Lamps lighted, dusk falling</p><p><br></p><p>like the song of wedding reeds in the soul;</p><p><br></p><p>juicy flower-like sounds spread in the mango groves,</p><p><br></p><p>a white dove flew from high parapets, into my courtyard.</p><p><br></p><p>A white dove descends in the first experience of samadhi. Flowers
bloom all around. A flute melody resounds. A reed begins to play inside.
All vibrations, all tones are awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>a flute melody rings in my ear</p><p><br></p><p>the heart-longed-for guest has come home;</p><p><br></p><p>The awaited guest has come – the ‘atithi,’ the one with no date. In
this country we have called the guest the atithi because he arrives
without a set date. By now the only remaining atithi is god, all other
guests set a date before coming. Now they send a message ahead that they
are coming. They are saying that it is not right to suddenly shove their
way in. We will be coming. Take care to prepare yourselves, because
nowadays no one is happy to see a guest. If a message comes first then
people can get ready. The cursing and swearing can be done earlier. What
has to be said to the wife can be said. What has to be said to the
husband can be said. By the time they arrive politeness has returned. If
they suddenly come, who knows – the truth might come out! One has to say
that it is a blessing, that seeing you our hearts are very delighted.
This is not what is inside. Something else is inside. The Western custom
of first informing is good so that people can get ready, can fortify
their hearts.</p><p><br></p><p>Now god is the only remaining atithi – he doesn’t fix a date. There
is no prior indication of his coming. No one can say when the first
experience of samadhi will happen. Spontaneously, out of season... The
truth is what happens when you are not waiting, not expecting at all. As
long as you are waiting you remain tense. Tension remains in your mind.
While you are watching the path you can’t be total. Watching the path is
also a thought and thought is the barrier. As long as you are thinking,
“Now he will come”, it has not happened yet, you are still surrounded by
thoughts. Clouds have gathered. How can the sun come out? It comes
suddenly, spontaneously – when you are just sitting... not doing
anything, not even meditating – then the first experience of samadhi
happens. Even when you are meditating somewhere a desire remains in the
mind – perhaps it will happen now, it must happen now. It hasn’t
happened yet, it is overdue! Complaints go on arising.</p><p><br></p><p>Continuing to meditate, meditating one day a moment happens when you
are sitting, not even meditating, peaceful, just healthy, silently – and
it comes!</p><p>a flute melody rings in my ear</p><p><br></p><p>the heart-longed-for guest has come home;</p><p><br></p><p>a thrill in my soul, a sparkle in my eye, sweet, sweeter my restless
song cries out in joy</p><p>I am home, courtyard, threshold, door.</p><p><br></p><p>Lamps lighted, dusk falling</p><p><br></p><p>like the song of wedding reeds in the soul;</p><p><br></p><p>juicy flower-like sounds spread in the mango groves,</p><p><br></p><p>It happens. Don’t ask the definition. Ask the path. Ask how it
happens, don’t ask what happens. It cannot be said. There is no way to
talk about it. It is not something to be said, it is something to know.
But the method can be told, indications can be given – move this way, be
careful that way. When the mind is without thoughts, peaceful, empty of
expectation, free of desire and longing – in that very moment. Whenever
such a moment of spring is adorned within you the inner reed begins to
play. Flowers bloom out of season. A ray descends from the sky and makes
you forever different, changed. You can never become the same again. The
first experience of samadhi – and you are bathed!</p><p><br></p><p>You have been dirty for centuries. Much dust of long journeys has
gathered. The first experience of samadhi carries away all the dust. All
beliefs, all traps of belief are finished. You become innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>Did not Gorakh say it is like a small child is born within? – in the
inner silence a child’s voice arises, a new arising of life.</p><p><br></p><p>In samadhi your death happens... DIE, O YOGI, DIE... The ego dies.
You are destroyed and become the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.</p><p>WHO WILL KEEP THESE THORNS?</p><p><br></p><p>THE GARDEN IS SILENT, THE GARDENER SILENT</p><p>THE QUESTION REMAINS SILENT IN ITSELF THE DAY IS SILENT, NIGHTS ARE
SILENT JET BLACK CLOUDS HAVE ARISEN</p><p>A COMPLETELY SILENT DARKNESS HAS COME. MASTER, PLEASE DISPEL THIS
STATE.</p><p>Kannumal. As long as there are questions, answers will remain silent.
It is because of the questions that answers are silent. The answer does
not come from questions. When questions have gone and the mind has
become free of questions, the answer comes. In a crowd of questions the
answer is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>You are right: A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.
The answers</p><p>will remain silent. The questions are making such an uproar how
should the answers speak? And remember questions are many, the answer is
one. The answer is singular, questions are plural. There is a crowd of
questions. Just as there are many illnesses, but health is one. There
are not many kinds of health. If you tell someone you are healthy they
don’t ask you what kind of health, which type of healthiness. But if you
tell someone you are sick they immediately ask what you are sick with.
Ilnesses are many, health is one. Questions are many, the answer is one.
And because of these many questions you do not grasp the one answer. You
are right, there is a crowd of questions. Question upon question in all
directions... questions emerging from questions, arising, disappearing,
made anew. You are surrounded by questions it is true. But this is the
very reason the answer is silent.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer is not silent. The answer too is speaking, but the answer
is one and the questions are many. It is lost like a bird’s peep in the
band room... It is lost like someone singing softly in a noisy
bazaar.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer can be found. The answer is not far away. The answer is
very near. You are the answer. The answer resides in your center. Let go
of questions a little. Don’t give importance to questions. Don’t give
much value to questions. Slowly slowly become disinterested in
questions. Don’t encourage questions, don’t welcome them, ignore them.
Be indifferent to questions. One who goes into questions strays off into
the jungle of philosophy. Let questions come and go. Look at the crowd
of questions like you look at people moving on the street – nothing to
give, nothing to take – with detachment, standing far away... The more
distance there is between you and your questions, the better. Because it
is in this gap the answer will arise.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever someone came to Buddha, and asked questions, Buddha said,
“Stop, stay here for two years. Stay near me in silence for two years,
then ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once a great philosopher came to Buddha. His name was Maulungaputta.
He was a well known philosopher. He had brought a mass of questions.
Buddha listened to his questions and said, “Maulungaputta, do you really
want the answer? If you really want it, can you pay the price?”</p><p>Maulungaputta said, “The end of my life is coming near. My whole life
I have been asking these questions. I received many answers but no
answer has proved to be an answer. From every answer new questions have
arisen. The solution was not in any answer. What price do you ask? I am
ready to pay the full price. I want only to solve these questions. I
want to leave this earth with these questions solved.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Buddha said, “Good. People also ask questions but are not ready
to pay the price. This is why I asked you. Sit in silence for two years,
this is the price. Sit near me in silence for two years without saying
anything. When two years have passed, I myself will tell you,
‘Maulungaputta, now ask your questions.’ Then you can ask what you need
to ask. And I promise that I will answer everything, I will dispel all
doubts. But two years completely still and silent. Don’t bring it up for
two years.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maulungaputta was thinking whether to say yes or no. Two years is a
long time and who knows if this man can be trusted, will he answer even
after two years or not? He asked, “Do you give full assurance that you
will answer after two years.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “I give complete assurance, if you ask I will answer.
But if you do not ask, who will I answer?”</p><p><br></p><p>At that time there was a disciple, a bhikshu, sitting in meditation
under a tree nearby. He began laughing uproariously.</p><p><br></p><p>Maulungaputta asked, “Why is this bhikshu laughing?” Buddha said,
“You ask him.”</p><p>The bikshu said, “If you want to ask then ask now. I was deceived in
the same way. He made a fool of me too. But he is telling the truth that
if you ask after two years he will answer, but who asks after two years?
I have sat silently for two years. Now he goes on prodding me, saying
ask brother. But after two years of remaining silent nothing remains to
be asked, the answer is received. If you want to ask, ask now, otherwise
after two years nothing will be left to ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is exactly what happened, Maulungaputta stayed two years.
When two years were over, Buddha did not forget, he remembered the exact
date. Maulungaputta had forgotten when two years would be over because
one whose thoughts have become slowly slowly quiet loses awareness of
time. How to keep track of time, what day it is, what year it is! All
was gone, all had flowed away. And what was the need? He would sit every
day with the Buddha so Friday or Saturday, Sunday or Monday all were the
same. June or July, hot or cold all were the same. Inside him there was
only one vibe – of peace, of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Two years were over. Buddha said, “Maulungaputta, stand up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maulungaputta stood up. Buddha said, “Now you can ask, because I
don’t go back on my promise. Do you have something to ask?”</p><p><br></p><p>Maulungaputta started laughing and said, “That bikshu was right. Now
I have nothing to ask. The answer has come. Through your grace the
answer has come.”</p><p>The answer has not been given but it is received. The answer does not
come from outside, the answer comes from within. Think of it like
digging a well. First rocks and gravel are removed, rubbish is removed,
dry earth is removed then wet earth, then mud, then flowing water... The
flowing water has been suppressed. The layers and layers of your
questions have collected, the flowing stream is repressed beneath all
this. Dig, push these questions aside. And there is only one way to push
them aside: as a witness alertly watch this stream of questions. Just go
on watching this stream, don’t do anything. Sit every day an hour or
two, let the stream flow. Don’t be in a hurry to stop it today. This is
why Buddha said two years. After some three months the first rustling of
stillness begins. And as two years are over the experience ripens. Only
if one has enough patience to sit two hours everyday, not doing
anything... The whole art is hidden in this not doing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask: How did Buddha’s first samadhi happen? He was sitting
under a tree, not doing anything, then it happened. For six years he did
much – great control, exercise, breath control, who knows what all he
did. He had gotten tired doing everything. That night he decided before
sleeping, “Now there is nothing more to do, it is enough. Nothing
happens from doing.” That night he stopped doing. That night he went to
sleep in a complete state of non-doing, in a silent mood. In the morning
he opened his eyes and samadhi was standing at the door. The guest he
had been waiting for had come. The last star of dawn was disappearing
and inside Buddha’s last thought disappeared. Outside the sky was
emptied of the last star, inside the last thought dissolved. Samadhi
came, the answer came. This is why it is called samadhi, because in it
is the solution, the samadhan.</p><p><br></p><p>Dusk came, earth and sky became silent clouds of dust stirred up in
the eyes</p><p>the eyelids blinked from the load, becoming moist. The dusk asked,
why are you sad?</p><p>I have no answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Night came, engulfed in blackness</p><p><br></p><p>in the thick dark the door of the mind opened in the fire, sparks
began laughing.</p><p>The night asked, why this burning? I have no answer.</p><p>Sleep came, consciousness silent</p><p><br></p><p>the body tired and fell asleep, but the spirit explored magic-filled
lanes of dream.</p><p>Sleep asked, why this forgetting?</p><p>I have no answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Questions are scattered in every direction I have no answer.</p><p>Don’t cling to questions or you will not find answers. No one has
found the answer moving with the help of questions. Let questions arise,
this is the itching of the mind. Itching is the right word. Sometimes
you feel itchiness and you scratch it – just like this, questions are
the itching of the mind. Nothing is solved by itching, but if you don’t
ask you will also feel uncomfortable. By itching you get a little
momentary relief – just like your answers. Grab onto one answer and get
relief for a little while. Very soon questions will arise from this
answer. Then relief will disappear, the search for the answer will begin
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Kannumal, you are right:</p><p><br></p><p>A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE COME, THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.</p><p>WHO WILL KEEP THESE THORNS?</p><p><br></p><p>THE GARDEN IS SILENT, THE GARDENER SILENT THE QUESTION REMAINS SILENT
IN ITSELF</p><p>THE DAY IS SILENT, NIGHTS ARE SILENT JET BLACK CLOUDS HAVE ARISEN</p><p>A COMPLETELY SILENT DARKNESS HAS COME. A MASS OF QUESTIONS HAVE
ARISEN,</p><p>THE ANSWERS ARE SILENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The answers will remain silent. Answers don’t speak. When you stop
speaking, you will immediately encounter them. Your voice will disappear
and you will find – emptiness speaks within you, silence speaks within
you. Suddenly, in that silence is the solution, the answer to all the.
In that silence is peace, is happiness, is the highest bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you noticed? Questions arise because of suffering. Suffering
gives birth to questions. When you have a headache you ask why you have
a headache. When you don’t have a headache you don’t ask why you don’t
have one. When you are sick you go the the doctor and ask why you are
sick What is the cause? But when you are healthy you don’t go the doctor
and ask why you are healthy. What is its cause? No question arises in
health, the question arises in illness. Questions arise from
unhappiness, questions become weak in happiness.</p><p>As soon as you become peaceful inside and you get a glimpse of a
little happiness, you will be surprised – questions disappear. Who asks,
why ask? When the pain does not remain how can questions born of pain
remain? They are finished by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS PRAYER?</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is a state of gratitude. Prayer is thankfulness.</p><p>God has given so much, at the very least we can give thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is a preparation to welcome him. The guest will come, the
guest will have to come. Decorate the house with flowers and boughs.
String flower garlands. Prepare lamps of blessing. Prayer is a
preparation to welcome. Who knows when the guest will come? I will be
ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Since I heard you will come to my door, each day I fill my house with
new wreaths and flowers! O my life, look all around – the door, the
threshold, the courtyard</p><p>I have swept the whole house in your welcome; because your feet are
delicate beloved,</p><p>the whole path is decorated with flower petals; since I heard you
will come to my courtyard,</p><p>I fill the whole street with festive spires and streamers. Ever since
I heard you will come to my door,</p><p>each day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! I had thought
life a rather desolate place,</p><p>I thought no song here was mine; never did a song</p><p>burst forth from these strange lips;</p><p><br></p><p>ever since I heard you will sing my song,</p><p>each day I try out and bring new rhymes, new rhythms! Ever since I
heard you will come to my door,</p><p>each day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! In the eyes
there is a festival of new dreams,</p><p>this seven-colored-wish smiles in my heart;</p><p><br></p><p>how can I cut the beautiful wings of imagination, the heart’s golden
bird is restless;</p><p>ever since I heard you will overwhelm my life, every day I dream
bewitching dreams!</p><p>Ever since I heard you will come to my door,</p><p><br></p><p>each day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers! Standing at
the crossroads I realize,</p><p>I don’t know on which path you will come;</p><p><br></p><p>the world says I have become your mad woman, dark lover caress this
madness;</p><p>ever since I heard you will take an unknown path, I light lamps each
day on every path!</p><p>Ever since I heard you will come to my door,</p><p><br></p><p>each day I fill my house with new wreaths and flowers!</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the guest will come, on whichever path he will come, from
whichever door he will come, prayer is the preparation for his coming!
Prayer is a mood of welcoming.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t fall into formal prayer. Let prayer be spontaneous, direct,
arising from your heart, only then will it be meaningful. Not scriptural
but heartful. Then even if it is babbling...</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen that when a small child starts babbling the first time
how sweet its babbling is. Later when he starts to speak correctly
perhaps no one will pay attention to him. But babbling is so sweet that
the mother is delighted and calls everyone around to hear. He doesn’t
say anything clearly yet. But when he starts speaking, no one
bothers.</p><p>In the beginning prayer is like babbling. And remember a prayer that
is babbled reaches to god, if it is from the heart, spontaneous,
yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Whom shall I befriend today?</p><p><br></p><p>In the sky with billowing dark clouds, imagination dances, becoming a
peacock, feelings pull me towards them.</p><p>Tell me, with whom shall I flow? today, thirst is floating on my
lips, the heart sitting, silent, sad,</p><p>in the breath an agitated sigh,</p><p><br></p><p>will I remain in pain on the verge of death? The language of the eyes
is unknown,</p><p>my song flying like a bird,</p><p><br></p><p>a great dilemma in the heart,</p><p><br></p><p>should I endure the remorse of helplessness? The hour of evening is
impatient,</p><p>a gentle breeze dancing and turning, a suffocating pain rising</p><p>who to tell this lingering agony to? Whom shall I befriend today?</p><p>Tell me, with whom shall I flow?</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is a submission like this. Love is from the sky... No answer
comes from another direction. This is why the prayer of one who waits
for an answer will quickly cease. Don’t just wait for an answer, keep
making your offering. Don’t be concerned whether he will answer or not,
whether the matter reaches to him or not, don’t worry about all this.
Don’t even try to use your prayer to change god. Just be concerned
whether your prayer is going deeper. Is my prayer soaked with my tears,
soaked with my bliss? Is the mark of my smile on my prayer? And is the
signature of my spirit on my prayer? Just be concerned with this. And
one day suddenly prayer reaches. Your babbling is heard.</p><p>And in that moment in your temple of silence that child is born. That
innocent consciousness enters. The white dove descends, the first
glimpse of samadhi has come... it will come, it will certainly come.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has said, what has happened to me can happen to you. I say the
same to you, what has happened to me can happen to you too. What has
happened to one man is the birthright of all.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

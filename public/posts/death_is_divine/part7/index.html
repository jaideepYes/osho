He does not even think ‘Who am I?’ but goes on running. What will the result of this hard running be? What will we get?\nwhat rhyme or reason in going on like this?\nStop a little. Reconsider it for once: ‘Who am I?’ Let this question awaken, because when you know the answer to this question in your depths, when the arrow of this question pierces your soul the mystery of life lifts its veil.\nBut people sitting in temples, mosques, and churches in the name of religion don’t stop either. They just keep on going. Their running continues. You want to have money, they want to have heaven. You want to have power, they want to have god. But where there is wanting, there is madness. And where there is wanting, there is rivalry. Where there is wanting there is competition, the whole marketplace. Where there is wanting there is fear – I shouldn’t be defeated anywhere, no one should win before me. Where there is wanting there is condemnation, there is opposition. Where there is wanting there is struggle, there is tension. As soon as wanting is gone an incomparable relaxation comes into life. As soon as wanting goes the days of autumn are gone, spring has come.\nWho is religious? Not one who has changed his desire, rather one who has understood desire. Wanting makes you run, run irrelevantly, run uselessly, run meaninglessly, run for the sake of running. Then running becomes a habit. Man just goes on running. Running continues until he falls\ninto his grave. He never reaches anywhere. After all this running we reach only to our grave. Nothing remains in our hands. Perhaps we had brought something, that too we let slip through our fingers. But running latches on to the mind so tightly that even if we awaken from the meaninglessness of running, we will start running again. We are so bound in chains that even when we are tortured by the agony of chains, we caste new chains. It may be that you caste golden chains in place of iron ones. And it may also be that you stud your golden chains with diamonds and jewels. But chains are chains.\nHere certainly the worldly are bound, here the so called spiritual people are also bound. A free person is one who has no wanting. He doesn’t want god. He doesn’t even want heaven. One who has understood the meaninglessness of wanting, that wanting takes one astray, makes one run. One who has understood the feverishness of wanting, one who has understood the madness of wanting, one who has seen the whole eye of wanting and has let desire drop and not taken up any new desire – one who becomes so empty of wanting attains god. God is already attained. Wanting goes and immediately the eyes open. Desire is destroyed and immediately god is incarnated. He was hidden, waiting for desire to get out of the way so he could appear face to face. It is not only that you are eager for his sight and touch, he too is eager for your sight and touch. But a wall of wanting stands in between.\nWhat is the meaning of wanting? Wanting means, I don’t want to be as I am, I want to be something else. Wanting means, I don’t want to be where I am, I want to be somewhere else. Wanting means: today? – today I am not happy, tomorrow I will be happy. Wanting says: move, run, reach.\nDropping wanting means, I am satisfied where I am, I am blissful as I am, there is no desire to be anything else.\nAll desires are desires to be something else. Hence all desires deprive you of your center. As soon as wanting is gone you become enthroned in your center. As soon as you have become enthroned in your center the devotee is god.\nToday’s sutra:\nYOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING DRUGS? BY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL, SHREE GORAKH RAJA SPEAKS PLAIN TRUTH. YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS...\nHe says, if you become a yogi but still condemn others then yoga has been lost.\nHere, a few things have to be understood. The first thing, it is necessary to understand the difference between condemnation and criticism. Gorakh also makes criticisms. This too is a critical sutra. He is saying...\nYOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING DRUGS?\n... those who become yogis and condemn others, eat fish and meat, drink and smoke drugs, such people numbering in the thousands, fall into hell.\nBY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL...\nSuch people exist in vast numbers and fall into hell. Gorakh says, I am telling you the truth: listen.\nThis does contain criticism, but there is no condemnation in it. The difference between criticism and condemnation is subtle and if it is not understood there can be misunderstanding. Buddha criticized and so did Mahavira. Christ criticized and Mohammed also. There has never been a master on the earth who did not criticize. What is the difference?\nThe difference between criticism and condemnation is subtle. Sometimes condemnation can appear like criticism and sometimes criticism can appear like condemnation. There is a very close relationship. Their form and color are similar but their soul is very different. Criticism is out of compassion, condemnation is out of hatred. Criticism is to awaken, condemnation is to destroy. The objective of criticism is discovery, the objective of condemnation is to demolish the other’s ego, to cover them with dirt, to trample them underfoot. The objective of condemnation is to deliver a blow to the other’s being, to wound. The objective of criticism is to seek the truth. The diamond has fallen in the dirt, how can we wash it, how can we cleanse it.\nCriticism is utterly friendly, no matter how hard it is, still it contains friendliness. And condemnation no matter how sweet it is, no matter how pleasant it is, contains poison. Poison can be given only covered in sugar.\nCondemnation arises from egotism: I am greater than you, I am going to make you look small. Criticism is not concerned with the ego. Criticism is not concerned with me versus you.\nCriticism is an exploration into what truth is, into how is truth is. Criticism can be very hard because a sword sometimes must be used to cut falsehood. There are stones of falsehood so the hammers and chisels of truth have to prepare them.\nUltimately Gorakh is making blows with hammer and chisel. And after Gorakh comes Kabir who keeps a sharper blade – on his sword there is more of an edge. Kabir’s blows are such that they cut to bits. But they don’t cut you to bits, they cut your falseness. When you attack a thief it is condemnation and when you attack stealing it is criticism. When you start hating the sinner it is condemnation and when you hate the sin it is criticism.\nA yogi cannot condemn. Only a completely unconscious person enjoys condemning. What is the psychology of condemning? Most people in the world have fallen into condemning. What is its psychology? Its psychology is clear and very simple. Every person wants the status for his ego that I am the greatest. It is very difficult to prove this. It is difficult to prove that I am the greatest because everyone else is trying to prove it. And they are all trying to prove only one thing that they are the greatest. How many people can be the greatest? Such fierce fighting ensues that it is almost impossible to win. Who can win? Every person will fight against billions of others. Defeat is certain. In this, all will be defeated. In this, no one can ascend. So the mind finds an easy remedy. The mind says: it may be difficult to prove that I am the greatest but it is easy to prove that no one is greater than me.\nRemember it is always very difficult to prove the affirmative of anything. A negative statement is always easy. For instance if you want to prove that god exists it is very difficult. Your life will have\nto pass through the fire of austerities. Even then it is unknown when the proof will happen – in this lifetime, in many lives? But that god does not exist can be proven right now. There is no problem. Only a little skill in argument is needed. To be an atheist is not a matter of great proficiency, of great intelligence. The most idiotic of idiots can be an atheist.\nThere is a famous story by Turgenev: THE GREAT FOOL. In a village there was a fool. He was very upset because no matter what he said people laughed at him. People had decided he was a blithering idiot. Even when he said something right people still laughed at him. He lived cowering, not daring even to speak. If he didn’t speak people laughed, if he spoke people laughed. If he did something people laughed, if he didn’t do anything people laughed. A monk came to the village. That night the fool fell at the monk’s feet and said, “Give me some blessing. is my whole life to be spent shrinking and cowering like this? Will I die a blithering idiot? Is there no way I can become a little intelligent?”\nThe monk said, “There is a way. Follow this sutra: condemn everything.” He said, “What will happen through condemning?”\nThe monk said, “You do it for seven days then come again to me.” The fool asked, “How should I condemn?\nThe monk said, “Whatever anyone says make a negative statement. For instance if someone says look what a beautiful sun is coming out, you say what’s beautiful about it? Prove it. Where is the beauty? What beauty? It comes out everyday, it has been coming out for billions of years. It is a globe of fire – what beauty? If someone says look Jesus’ words are so lovely, you immediately jump on him saying what is so lovely in them? What is so special about them? What’s new in them? The same thing has always been said, it is all thrashed over. It is all stale, all borrowed. You just deny. Someone says, looking at a beautiful woman, what a beautiful woman. You say: what of it? So what if her nose is a little longer? So what if her skin is a little whiter? Lepers are white too. What beauty? Prove it. You demand proof from everyone and remember to always remain in the negative. Put them in the positive, you remain in the negative. Come to me after seven days.”\nAfter seven days when the idiot came, he did not come alone, many had become his disciples. They came on ahead. They had hung flower garlands around his neck. A band was playing. He said to the monk, “The device worked. The whole village was forced to be silent. Wherever I went people lowered their heads. The news spread among the people that I am a great genius. No one could win against me. Now what should I do?”\nHe said, “Now don’t do anything, just remain with this. If you want to save your intellect never fall into the positive. If someone speaks of god then immediately bring in atheism. Whatever is said, always make a negative statement. No one will be able to defeat you because to disprove a negative statement is very difficult. To prove a positive statement is very difficult.”\nTo affirm god great intelligence is needed, a very subtle sensitivity is needed. Total wakefulness of the heart is needed. A purified state of consciousness is needed. A little light is needed within. But to deny god nothing is needed. In denying god there is no commitment. This is why people in the world condemn.\nThe psychology of condemnation is cheap psychology, an easy way out. Your genius will be proven by it. And there is no cost. “Using neither turmeric nor alum the dye came out fine.” There is no cost at all. There is no need to go anywhere to learn. There is no need for satsang. This is why everyone is skillful at condemning.\nYou find people everywhere enjoying the mood of condemnation. Who knows, why did those who numbered the nine rasas, the nine dramatic moods leave out the mood of condemnation? All the other moods come only now and again, the mood of condemnation comes to people every day from morning till night. You read the newspaper to enjoy the feeling of condemnation. When someone is being condemned you immediately cock your ears and start listening. If someone comes and says that the neighbor’s woman has eloped with someone, how attentive you become! Your attention is so focused in that moment that you forget all matters of the world. You start digging, asking, “Say something more, tell what happened next. Elaborate a little, don’t make it so brief. Where were they eloping to, tell the whole story before you go. Sit down and have some tea.” You roll out the red carpet.\nWherever you notice condemnation happening you enjoy. You enjoy because another person is being made small and in his becoming smaller you inwardly experience I am bigger. This is why if a beggar slips and falls on a banana peel on the street there is not so much enjoyment as when an emperor slips and falls on a banana peel. The heart becomes happy – what Mulla Nasruddin calls the experience of the heart becoming garden-garden.\nWhen he said this to me this the first time I was surprised and I asked him, “What is this ’garden- garden?”\nHe said, “Oh, it is just the English translation of our Hindi expression ‘baag-baag ho jaana’.”\nIf some emperor slips and falls, how happy the mind becomes. When when you hear the news that the prime minister or the president has been caught doing some illegal activity, how the joy of condemnation spreads. What’s the point? Why should anyone be concerned with it? If the prime minister has fallen in love with some woman, enough... As if a very rare incident has occurred. So much interest spreads, people become so eager. This tells only one thing about what is inside you, indicates only one thing: that you were waiting for someone to get caught, to fall somewhere, for a foot to slip on a banana peel, for him to fall flat. This was your heart’s desire.\nThis is why people become eager and excited to remove someone from power when he has been in office for four or five years. It is too long, this man must fall. Then trivial things are blown out of proportion and spread around. And people are ready to believe them.\nHave you noticed something strange, if you praise someone no one is ready to listen, no one is ready to accept it. If you say, “Look at such and such person. He has become a great being.” They will say, “We have seen all these great souls, these mahatmas! There is no great soul, nor has there ever been. It’s all deception. Some trick is happening. Just wait, stop a little, when he is caught you will know. We have seen many falling.”\nBut if someone says to you that such and such person is stealing, such and such person is deceiving, such and such person has taken a bribe you will never deny it saying, no-no, how could it be? You\nwill immediately agree, as if you had already known it. We have accepted that except ourselves people are all bad. Some have been found out. Others have not been found out and will be sometime. But except for us all people are bad. This is our preconceived belief. Whatever supports our preconceived belief we agree with immediately.\nOur state is such that if someone says to you, look at such and such man, he is playing flute so nicely, you will say: “What bad flute playing! He’s a thief, depraved, a scoundrel.” As if being a scoundrel and depraved and a thief prevents him from playing flute. You will immediately condemn saying, “What lousy flute playing, what’s special about his flute? We know him well enough. We know his father and grandfathers too. How can he play flute?”\nBut the reverse statement you will never hear – when someone says, look, that man is a thief, a cheat, depraved; and you say, “No, how can it be? Because he plays such lovely flute. No-no, it cannot be. A man who plays such lovely flute a thief? depraved? – how is it possible?”\nYou will never speak this way. It is against your ego. It is condemnation that inflates your ego. This is why people praise very reluctantly – they do it very unwillingly, as if compelled. They do it when there is something to get by praising. This is why superficially they praise, but beneath they are taking revenge.\nThere was a case in court. A political leader had initiated a defamation case against a man. The man, in a restaurant where fifty or sixty people were present, had called the politician a son-of-an- owl. Naturally the politician became angry. Son-of-an-owl! I will get him back good.\nMulla Nasruddin was standing right next to the politician when he was called a son-of-an-owl. So he said, “Mulla, you will have to be a witness. He said it in front of you.”\nHe said, “I will certainly be a witness, I am an eye witness. He insulted you just in front of me. I was standing next to you.”\nWitnesses were called in court. The magistrate asked Mulla Nasruddin, “Fifty people were there, and the man being charged with making insults says: ‘I didn’t say it to anyone in particular. Yes, I used the word son-of-an-owl. But fifty or sixty people were there. I wasn’t implicating the politician when I said this.’ What proof do you have Nasruddin that he said it implying the politician?”\nNasruddin said, “I know that there were fifty or sixty people there, but there was no son-of-an-owl except the politician.”\nNow what to do? Even his witness is saying it. You hope that those in power, in office, those who have money will fall flat. Your heart will get great comfort from this. In the world whenever someone’s downfall happens, people share great comfort, much lightness comes. People are waiting for someone’s character to be corrupted. They are greatly supporting it. To create character is very difficult. To bring dignity to one’s life is difficult, to bring greatness is difficult. But if you want to take away someone’s greatness it is easy to spread and inflate rumors about him. The more you talk badly of him the more you feel good inside. This is the psychology of condemnation – it is the shadow of ego and the nourishment of ego also.\nBut this does not mean that I am telling you to live blindly. Or that Gorakh is telling you to live blindly. To remain silent when you see something wrong: I am not saying this, nor is Gorakh saying it. If Gorakh were saying this then what he has said here could not be said. Remember this, he has seen this wrong, hasn’t he? He has seen a yogi and condemning, a yogi and consuming fish, meat and drugs. So he says they will fall into hell. Don’t take it as condemnation. There is no condemnation at all in it. There is natural compassion in it, there is spontaneous sympathy in it. It is not his intent to make them look lower. In reality it his desire that they rise higher, his desire that they awaken.\nSometimes one who comes to awaken seems like an enemy. Sometimes it happens that you tell someone, “Brother, wake me up in the morning, I have to catch a train at four o’clock. And anyway you get up at three, at the hour of Brahma. Please get me up.”\nHe comes to get you up at three o’clock, you are swearing at him under your breath – at the man that you told to wake you up at three – saying, this rude fellow has come, this bastard. I told him – it was a mistake – but there is no need to go through with a mistake, how to get rid of this knave? And if he starts to pull on you to get you up there can be a fight.\nThere was a famous German thinker, Immanuel Kant. He used to keep a servant. He had great difficulty in getting up in the morning. The servant’s whole job was this: to wake him up even if he fights. So the servant was hit, he hired the servant for this! Many servants had quit and left saying, what kind of arrangement is this? But he said this is what I have hired you for. Don’t worry about it, I am not saying not to strike back if I hit you.\nThere are all kinds of people! In the West now an electric blanket is made that you can set an alarm on, it has a clock attached and at exactly five o’clock in the morning an electric shock... An arrangement had to be made for those who cannot get up. A shock is applied and you leap up. An ordinary alarm won’t work, people just turn it off. They throw the clock on the floor. Their own clock! Then they regret later that it was smashed, a fifty rupee loss. They themselves set the alarm, they themselves smash the clock. Something had to be done for them.\nOne who awakens does not seem loving because at that time you are lost in sweet slumber. It may be that you are seeing a sweet dream. It may be that at just that very moment you were going to meet Cleopatra, or Hema Malini was just coming. You were almost going to embrace and this fellow came, or the alarm went off. Will anyone put up with such a clock?\nThis is why we have been able to accept buddhas only with great difficulty. We can accept them only grudgingly. How can the people who break your dreams seem loving to you? You will be angry. Do not think that a yogi should not be critical, who else will? He has earned the right. But he will not condemn. In his eyes you will not be disgraced. His voice may be hard. His voice may be very sharp. His words may be razor like. They should be.\nKabir has said,\nKabir stands in the market, stout staff in hand. “Burn down your house, and come along with me.”\nIf you are ready to set fire to your own house, come with me. And he is standing with a staff! He won’t even let you look back, otherwise he’ll smash your head.\nA yogi can be hard. But hard towards your defects, not towards you. He has great compassion towards you, great love. This is why sometimes there can be confusion. Sometimes you can be mistaken. But understand the distinction clearly.\nYOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS...\nYou have become a yogi and you are condemning others?\n... EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING DRUGS?\nAnd still you haven’t let go of meat, haven’t let go of wine? And you still go on drowning in intoxicating substances like marijuana and ganja?\nRemember one thing: those who are awake are against your wine, your meat and liquor for a different reason. You also may be against them, but your reason is different. You say don’t drink wine because it is a useless loss of money, because your health will be ruined. Don’t drink because your wife and kids will die of starvation. These reasons won’t stay with you long.\nFor instance if you have wealth in abundance and your wife and kids won’t die of starvation from your meat eating and drinking alcohol, then what is the problem? This teaching must be for the poor. For the rich? No, there won’t be any hindrance for them. Then this becomes a conditional teaching. This teaching says that the body will be ruined, but the body will be ruined at any rate. What difference is a day or two earlier or a day or two later? If you die at eighty or you die at seventy... it is better that you die at seventy, to leave the space empty for someone else those ten years. As it is there is too little space in the world. The crowd goes on growing, there is no space left to even wave ones hand. The sooner you leave the better. So if you live ten years longer, the world gets no benefit from it, nor is it a benediction for mankind. And if you die ten years earlier or ten years later what is the difference? If you stay ten years more, you will exploit a few more people, you will amass a little more money, fill your treasury a little more. People will be more bothered by you, what else? What more has your life been? There was no harmony, there was no coherence, there was no music. What will you do if you live longer?\nThese arguments do not work. And these arguments are not even true, because alcoholics are seen living long. An alcoholic doesn’t die quickly. If to die sooner or to die later is decisive then it is a great problem. Shankaracharya died at the age of thirty-three. Does it mean that one should avoid religion? Vivekananda died at age thirty-four. What does it mean? It means, “Brother, be careful! Don’t get involved in religion. Did you see the fate of Vivekananda? Did you see poor Shankaracharya, dying while still so young? This is no way to live a long life.”\nIn a BBC interview recently someone asked Morarji Desai, “What do you think about Churchill? because he drank a lot, smoked cigarettes, drank wine, ate meat. He never got up at the predawn hour of Brahma, never got up before nine or ten o’clock, but he lived long.” So Morarji Desai said he is an exception. And Morarji Desai thinks that he is living long due to drinking his own urine. But Churchill is an exception!\nI have heard, Mulla Nasruddin has turned eighty years old, but even now he comes in first in swimming. So journalists came to his house. His eightieth birthday was being celebrated. They asked, “You have just turned eighty, what is your secret? How do you still come first in swimming? – even the young are defeated by you.”\nSo he said, “It is because I never drank wine, never ate meat, never chased after women. I was never addicted to anything. This is the reason.”\nThe interviewers were impressed. But then Mulla said, “You needn’t be too much impressed by this. I am nothing. My father has reached a hundred, but in horse riding he has no equal. I also cannot equal him at horse riding, nor can the youngest of the young. And he drinks wine, pardon me,” Mulla said, “but he drinks wine and eats meat.”\nSo the journalists asked, “We want to meet your father. This is very surprising thing that he drinks wine, eats meat, is a hundred years old and no one can equal him at horse riding. Your family seems to be really marvellous. Where is your father, we want to meet this man.”\nMulla Nasruddin said, “It is not possible, because my father has gone to walk in my grandfather’s wedding procession.”\n“Grandfather’s wedding?”\nThen Mulla said, “Yes, he had to.”\n“Your grandfather is getting married?” the people asked.\nMulla said, “Not by choice, he had to. The woman is pregnant.” “How old is your grandfather?”\n“One hundred and twenty years.”\nWhat conclusion will you reach? How will you reach it? Alcoholics live long. By giving this kind of argument you cannot save anybody from drinking. These arguments are hollow. There is no strength in these arguments. This is why arguments continue and people continue drinking wine, continue smoking cigarettes, continue eating meat. Everything goes right on. This argument continues and everything else continues. No connection is ever created between these arguments and their way of life.\nWhen the enlightened say, when a man like Gorakh says don’t drink wine his reason is very different. It is not because you will live longer. Even if you live longer what will you do? What is the value of living? Nor is it because you will be healthier. Health has no great spiritual value. A sick man can attain god. And it is possible that a healthy man cannot attain god because he remains entangled in the world on account of his good health, thinking, “Now I am healthy. I will remember Rama in the end, right now I will enjoy. This life is only four days. Right now I will enjoy.”\nNo, these hollow principles are not any help. Then why does a person like Gorakh say it? His reason for saying it is very unique. You will be surprised to know it.\nI also want you to be free of wine, but my reason is not the same as Morarji Desai. I want you to be free of wine because there is a greater wine. If you remain entangled with this wine then you will never be able to drink that higher wine. I want to take you to the real wine hall, this is why I want to take you out of the false wine hall.\nGod is wine and such a wine that one who drinks it, drinks it forever. And such a self-forgetfulness that it comes and stays. And such a high that it is never broken. What you buy from the market and drink, if you drink it at night by morning the high will break. Then the same uneasiness, the same tension, the same worries. They can be forgotten for a little while drowning in alcohol but they cannot be destroyed. There is another wine where worries are destroyed. I want to give you this wine. Meditation is wine, prayer is wine. And when a temple is alive its style is that of a wine hall.\nI too want that you do not drink wine, but my reason is very paradoxical. I want it because if you remain entwined in the lower wine, then when will you drink the higher wine? When will you drink the real wine? Those who go on drinking water from dirty ponds at the side of the road, will they make the pilgrimage to the lake of consciousness or not? Will they swallow that clear, crystal clear, water down their throat or not?\nI don’t tell you to leave wine because I am a moralist, or because drinking wine is committing a great sin. What sin? Wine is purely vegetarian – the essential juice of the grape. What sin can this be? There is no sin from eating grapes, how can there be from drinking wine? You will not go to hell by drinking wine. But yes, by drinking wine you will be unable to receive the heavenly wine. You will remain deprived of it.\nI want the pebbles and stones to drop from your hands because a diamond mine is present. Why are you filling your bag with pebbles and stones? Morarji Desai and my statements are as different as earth and sky. His enmity is with your pebbles and stones. He says drop pebbles and stones, pebbles and stones are bad. I say I have no enmity with pebbles and stones. But there are diamonds and jewels. If your bag remains filled with pebbles and stones then diamonds and jewels will remain lying where they are. They are your birth right to attain, you should attain them, your destiny will never be fulfilled without them.\nRemember the difference, the difference is fundamental. I also say drop eating meat, but not because you will go to hell if you eat meat, not because if you eat meat it will be violence. I have no concern with these small things. If everyone who eats meat goes to hell then Jesus must be in hell. Ramakrishna Paramahansa must also be in hell – can a Bengali exist without fish? Without fish and boiled rice they cannot even exist. Ramakrishna Paramahansa kept on eating fish, he must be in hell.\nThese are trivial things. They have no value. But this much is certainly proven by them: that Ramakrishna Paramahansa’s sensitivity never became as deep as it could have. A small veil remained. His heart did not become as full of love as it could have. A little soot remained. Not that he went to hell, but there could have been another experience of beauty which he remained deprived of.\nNot that Jesus will go to hell. But there remained a little something missing in his understanding of life, a thorn remained. That thorn too could have come out, should have come out. And it seems to\nme that if Jesus had lived longer... he died young, was murdered... then perhaps the thorn would have come out. He was young. And where he was born they were all meat eaters. If he had grown a little older, his awareness had deepened, if his experience of the presence of god had become more and more solid, then certainly he would have dropped eating meat. In the ultimate state, when god starts appearing everywhere, it is impossible to think of destroying someone’s life for food.\nSo I don’t say it because meat eating is a sin, that in consequence of this sin you will be suffering in hell. Rather I say it because eating meat will decrease your sensitivity. It will take away the subtlety of your sensitivity. The pure music that could arise from within you will not be able to arise. You have put such thick and coarse strings on your veena. There will be music, song will arise, but you have put on thick, rough, cheap strings, when fine, subtle, aristocratic strings were available. You have mistreated your veena. Not that you will fall into hell, because you have put coarse strings on your veena.\nAnd note, don’t fall into the illusion that when you eat meat you have killed someone. No one can die. Hence it is not a sin that you have killed something. Death does not exist here. There is no way to kill anything. You only took away the body of a being. That being will take a new body. The question is not of killing, the question is can you take its body? The question is for you. That being will take a new body, take a new womb. No one dies. Krishna says, “Na hanyate hanyamane sharire.” The soul does not die when the body is killed. But the question is for you. You have shown insensitivity. There is not heartfulness inside of you. You remain a little stonelike, you are not soft. And if you are not soft your inner lotus will not blossom. Or will remain half blossomed. Or one or two petals will remain unblossomed.\nIn the highest state of consciousness meat eating is not possible. And those who want the highest state of consciousness should remain aware of this.\nSo Gorakh says rightly:\nYOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING DRUGS? BY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL...\nI have seen thousands of people going to hell this way.\n... SHREE GORAKH RAJA SPEAKS PLAIN TRUTH.\nI am speaking the truth, I am not condemning anyone. I am simply submitting what the fact is. And a revolution begins in the life of one who listens to the truth.\nNow Rahim is in a quandary, feet in both worlds,\nSeeking truth the world is lost, moving false Rama is lost.\nA moment of revolution comes in the life of one who has heard the truth, understood the truth. He starts to see that if he follows the truth he can attain Rama and by itself the world will disappear. The world does not have to be dropped, it disappears by itself. By the false Rama is not found, by\nthe truth the world is not found. One who sees this will have to make a clear choice. I call making this choice initiation, I call this choice sannyas. It is a decisive event.\nALONENESS THE SIDDHA KNOWS, NEEDING TWO IS SADHU, THE TRUE SEEKER, NEEDING FOUR-FIVE THE HOUSEHOLDER, TEN-TWENTY THE WORLDLY MAN.\nThe siddha, the realized one knows he is alone. And even in a crowd he is still alone. Understand it this way, even if you are sitting in a forest you are not alone. You have seen people going, where are they going? They are going to the mountains, but they take their transistor radio with them. They get lots of newspapers, buy magazines. Bring the wife, kids, and friends along – who wants to go alone? They are going to the mountains taking along a crowd, taking the whole bazaar. And if sometime they remain alone in the mountains even then they are not alone. It looks like they are sitting alone, but inside them memories go on circling of friends, wife, husband, children, family, money, wealth, shop, bazaar.\nEven if you are alone you are in a crowd. The siddha is one who is alone wherever he is. If he’s in a crowd he is still alone. A siddha means one who has become acquainted with his inner nature. We have come alone, we will go alone. We are alone. As we have come, so we are, so we will go. Our aloneness is eternal. And the play that we have created, of husband and wife, the ceremonies we have enacted, the families we have established are all illusion, they are play. They are not any more valuable that playing with dolls and doll houses. Play, certainly: I am not saying to stop playing, but remember that play is play.\nALONENESS THE SIDDHA KNOWS...\nOne who experiences aloneness is realized, and is called a siddha. One who remains alone even in company is called a siddha.\n... NEEDING TWO IS THE SADHU...\nOne who needs two, that cannot be alone, that cannot live without ‘I and thou’ – Gorakh says to consider him a sadhu, a seeker. He is called sadhu. This is no small thing, to be ready for only two. The mind is not ready even to accept many. One who has reached the one and accepts his being is a siddha. Now there is nothing left for him to attain. He has no more dependence. He has no more reliance on others. One who says at least one other is needed – whether that one is wife, or husband, or friend, or master, or disciple; one other is needed – even if that one is god, as long as the devotee says god is needed he has not been able to rise above the sadhu. Duality still remains established. You can establish duality in new directions – duality of husband and wife, duality of disciple and master, duality of devotee and god, but duality remains established. You will become a siddha, when you become non-dual. Now you are a seeker. This is no small thing, that you are ready for two. There are people here, who are not happy with many.\nA letter of Albert Camus says, even if I have all the women in the world, still I can’t be satisfied. Because when I see a woman walking on the street, I feel I want to have her. And what Camus’ letter says is the state of almost every man. How many will satisfy you? If god were to stand before you and say, ask, how many will satisfy you? Then you will be in great difficulty, how many should\nyou ask? If you think of a million the mind will say a hundred million while the opportunity is available. If you think of a hundred million then a hundred million too will seem small. It seems you should ask ten billion or a trillion or a billion billion. And still you will be uneasy, thinking why not take a bigger number, beyond a billion billion. You will ask for ten billion billion. Who knows what greater numbers there are! No matter how many you get you cannot be satisfied.\nThis is why Gorakh says that one who is a seeker is happy with two. He is happy with much less. He has come near to one. Now only one more remains to be dropped. Now only one more to be free of.\nNEEDING FOUR-FIVE THE HOUSEHOLDER...\nAnd one who is not happy with less than four or five is a householder. He is living in a family. Consider the meaning of householder, one who lives in a house is not called a householder – one who needs many is called a householder. One whose mind still cannot accept two.\nA friend of mine used to go to the mountains for the hot season. It happened about ten years ago that he said to me, “You come too.” The husband and wife both used to go.\nI said, “Why take me along between the two of you, husband and wife? Just you two go.”\nHe said, “We wish to take you along because if it is just the two of us we can never figure out what we want to do. If there is a third we feel a little easier. If only the two of us are to go then we won’t go. Two won’t do, at the very least three are needed.”\nNotice that at first people are alone, they are restless, they get married. Then married they begin to feel restless again so they give birth to children. The number goes on increasing... And it has no end. And if this is still not enough, go and become a member of the Rotary Club. If this still is not enough, join the Janata Party. Some crowd or other... some disturbance...\n... TEN-TWENTY THE WORLDLY MAN.\nAnd people who are not happy even with ten or twenty, they need a horde of associates, they need a whole army. They are worldly.\nThe siddha is one who is happy with his own existing. The worldly is one who is not satisfied even with a crowd of thousands, who is always searching for a crowd. Okay... let’s go see the Kumbha Mela. What will you do at the Kumbha Mela? Do you want to be pushed and shoved? The bigger the crowd, the more it grows, because many people enjoy a crowd. If a crowd is standing somewhere, you will abandon a hundred thousand jobs and go stand in the crowd. You forget your real work, why you had gone out. It may be that your wife was sick and you were going to call a doctor, but the crowd was so much that you felt to have a look at what is going on. You stood in the crowd, got lost in excitement.\nA crowd has its own magnetic attraction, that pulls people. The bigger the crowd, the more they get excited, get agitated. This is the most degenerate state of the mind, the crowd. And one who wants to stay with the crowd will have to follow it.\nSannyas is a means of becoming free of the crowd. One must repudiate the psychology of the crowd. The crowd says, if you remain like us you can live among us. Wear clothes like the clothes we wear. Have your hair cut like we have our hair cut. Do everything as we do. Then you can be a member. Then you can be with us.\nThe crowd says that if you attempt to show your own individuality then you can’t be with us. This is why every crowd tries to take away your individuality, to efface you, to make you a number, a statistic not a man. This is why no crowd can forgive you if you become a little unique. Very small things cannot be forgiven.\nA gentleman came to me saying, “Since my son has started coming to listen to you he has let his hair grow.”\nSo I said, “How does letting hair grow damage you?”\n“No,” he said, “It doesn’t damage me at all but in our family no one lets their hair grow like that.”\nSo I said, “It is the hairs fault. If they are left alone, won’t they grow? What’s the harm in it? He saves a little money. Why are you bothered by your son’s hair getting long?”\nHe was bothered but couldn’t give any clear answer to what was bothering him, but he was bothered, “... because he is becoming a little unique, becoming a little distinct from us. This has never happened in our family. Hair should be cut just like it should be.”\nWho decides how it should be cut? Who is the boss to decide this matter? I told him, “Do you worship Bhagwan Krishna?”\nHe said, “Of course I worship.” “Do you accept him totally?”\n“I accept him.”\n“His hair? If he were born in your family you would call him a hippie. And if he puts on his peacock crown, then? Think about your son a little, if he grows his hair, wears yellow clothes of silk, puts on ornaments etc, picks up a flute, starts setting down rhythms with his feet and stands with his peacock crown, then what will you do? Will you worship or not? Will you do puja and worship him – or will you do puja in the other sense and punish him?”\nThe crowd cannot forgive the slightest difference. The crowd wants you to become obedient. Do you know what people do in villages? The crowd ostracizes you – food and snacks are cut off, tobacco and visiting are cut off. And a man in the village for whom tobacco and visiting are cut off – no one offers him a smoke, no one calls him for a meal – that man is dead, his very living becomes difficult.\nThe cities have given man a kind of freedom that never existed in villages and could never exist there. The village was very enslaving. Villages have started being eliminated so freedom is increasing in\nthe world. A village was a very collective thing. The greatest danger in the village was that the village could excommunicate you on any excuse. Any slight thing and you were excommunicated, your life became hard. Who to live with all the time? Who to talk to? Social intercourse was shut off. Life was impossible. No one would speak to you or converse with you. The village is so small that if anyone talks with you social intercourse will be shut off for him too. Going out, people will avoid you.\nPeople praise the village highly, without seeing and understanding. The village was a great bondage, the village was a total prison. Even now the village is a prison. Even now there is no freedom in the village. There cannot be freedom in the village. Freedom is possible only in a big town where there are enough people that social intercourse cannot be shut off. If someone shuts you off then other people will be available that you can sit with, that you can speak with. The village is so small that control can easily be maintained.\nHence in a country like India the elimination of untouchability is impossible as long as villages exist. And the strange thing is that Mahatma Gandhi and all the people that have followed him think that the village should remain – and at the same time this they want untouchability to be eliminated. Untouchability cannot be eliminated in the village. In the village it is impossible to eliminate untouchability. There is no way. Untouchables cannot even drink water from the village well. They cannot even go to the village temple. In the city it can be eliminated, in the city who can know that an untouchable has come into the temple? No seal has been marked on the face of an untouchable.\nIn the world the job that Buddha and Mahavira were not able to accomplish, has been done by small things, like the railway. Buddha and Mahavira could not do the work that trains have done. An untouchable is sitting happily at your side. You cannot do anything. He has taken a ticket too. If you are to do something what will you do? And it is not certain that he is an untouchable. And it is possible he is wearing more stylish clothes than you, that you are smoking a ‘bidi’ and he is smoking a cigarette. What will you do? If you are hungry on the train you will eat with the untouchable sitting at your side, he will push up closer, he will shove more. You cannot do anything.\nI say unto you that what Buddha and Mahavira could not do the trains have done. Buddha and Mahavira tried hard to eliminate untouchability, they couldn’t manage. The poor trains have done it, have accomplished it. They have brought a revolution. The job that temples could not do, restaurants have done. The job pilgrimage centers could not do, cinema halls have done. Life has its own way of moving.\nThe city has brought a kind of freedom to man. In the village there is great trouble. In the village every inch of your behavior is known, every inch of your character is known. It is a small place. Everyone knows what everyone else is doing every moment. Each one knows, knows you through and through, just as you know them through and through. In the city it is very convenient. If you fall in love with a woman, she lives in the other side of the city. Your neighbors will not know that you have fallen in love with a woman. They think that every day you are going for satsang, that you have become a great devotee, early in the morning you leave for the temple. In the village this was not possible. In the village freedom was impossible, the village was bondage. The crowd was in control.\nThe birth of the individual has happened in cities. In villages no individuals existed, only the crowd existed. The soul is born in one who rises above the crowd, in him the birth of a soul starts to happen. In the crowd the soul is not born.\nThis is why I say a Hindu has no soul. A Muslim has no soul. He is part of a crowd. The crowd is suppressed by politics.\nBe an individual. Free yourself from prisons. Drop all discriminations. And you will find the soul starts shining inside of you. Start being alone.\nThere are difficulties in being alone. But one who passes through difficulties is cleansed also. GREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED, CONSIDER THIS WORD OF TRUTH: ONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT, LIFTS THE LOAD OFF HIS HEAD.\nA lovely statement. Gorakh is saying greatness comes only when you completely obliterate your greatness.\nGREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED...\nGreatness will arrive in your life when you completely efface and destroy your ego. When the feeling of I completely disappears. When will the ‘I’ disappear? When ‘thou’ is no longer needed. As long as you need the other, I too will remain. I and thou exist together.\nYou will be surprised to know that psychologists say the child first knows the other, then knows I. How can the child see himself at first? He doesn’t know anything of himself. First he knows the mother. He sees his mother sometimes comes close, sometimes goes away. Lying there in the cradle he goes on seeing that when I am hungry, when I cry mother comes near. When I am not troubled mother goes away. Slowly slowly it starts becoming clear to him that mother is separate from him. Mother is the other. As it starts to get clear to him that mother is distinct, then at the same time slowly slowly like a shadow it starts to become clear to him, I am distinct also.\nThe other arises first, then the I arises. And it disappears in the same way: first the other disappears, then I disappears. People who want to get rid of the I first, never get rid of it. So don’t try to get rid of the ego directly. Drop dependence on the other. Become such that you have no need of the other, such that you alone are enough – sufficient, satisfied, contented! Slowly slowly as the other is gone, the I will go just after it.\nI and thou are two sides of the same coin – on one side is written I, on the other side thou. It is easy to drop the other, because the other is other, she is separate. To drop the I is difficult. And in one who drops the other, the I drops by itself.\nGREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED...\n... and then greatness comes into your life. This is a rare statement. One whose ego, whose I; that I am above, I am great, I am prominent, I am special, I am extraordinary, incomparable – if such ideas of importance are destroyed, are erased, then importance manifests inside him. He becomes incomparable. You only think you are incomparable, you are not. He becomes certain.\nGorakh says think about this truth a little.\nONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT...\nAnd one who becomes void of I like this becomes tiny, becomes simple like a small child in whom the I has not yet been born, the master himself comes looking for him.\nONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT, LIFTS THE LOAD OFF HIS HEAD.\nAnd naturally if a bundle has been put on the head of a small child then who will not think of lifting it down? When you become tiny, become small, become a child, the master appears before you and only then can the bundle be brought down, only then can compassion shower on you. And if the bundle comes down, your load comes down – of thoughts, of desires – then the root is cut!\nWatering leaf by leaf, salting one snack at a time Rahim such intelligence! Who will call it great?\nYou have seen in a village when a woman is making bari snacks she will never salt them one bari at a time. Salt has to be mixed into the batter. When a gardener waters he doesn’t water each and every leaf, he waters the roots.\nWatering leaf by leaf...\nIt would be total madness if a gardener watered leaf by leaf.\n... salting one snack at a time\nAnd if someone separately salted each bari it would be madness. Rahim such an intelligence! Who will call it great?\nNo one will say this is an indication of intelligence. A gardener gives water to the roots. A woman making baris puts the salt in the batter. Get to the root. The root of all your illusions is ego. Cut the ego.\nAnother statement of Gorakh:\nNATH SAYS, LISTEN O AVADHU, KEEP THE MIND FOREVER STEADY,\nREMOVE THE EGO, SEX, ANGER. YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO ALL SACRED PILGRIM PLACES.\nDon’t go on a pilgrimage. There is not need to go anywhere. All directions become transformation, all become places of transformation. Just do one thing:\nREMOVE THE EGO, SEX, ANGER...\nAnd ego is the root. And ego still contains all the leaves – of sex, of anger, of greed. All the leaves are contained in the ego. Ego is the root. If this one thing is removed, it this one thing is said farewell\nto – the I – enough, the moment of life transformation has come. The great transformation has happened. You have entered from darkness into light.\nHOPE BRINGS DISTRESS, DOUBT BRINGS SORROW,\nAnd one who lives preserving hopes, lives holding desires will always be surrounded by adversities. The more your desire the more your dejection, because in this world no desire is fulfilled. Desire cannot be fulfilled. The nature of desire is not to be fulfilled. Desire is unfulfillable. As Buddha has said, craving is unfulfillable. It cannot be fulfilled.\nA man came to a Sufi fakir. And he said, “How can my craving be fulfilled?”\nThe fakir said, “Come with me. I am going to the well to get water, at the same time I can instruct you. When we reach, there will be no need to speak. You will be able to see it and understand.”\nThe enquirer was a little surprised, thinking what kind of instruction is this that can be given at the well. And is this man in his senses or not?” This fakir was carefree, very ecstatic. His eyes were as if he had just drunk wine. They were red. He was in ecstasy. His feet wobbled as he walked the way a merry drunkard walks. The enquirer started to feel a little afraid, the matter of the well, if he gives a shove? If he does something or he himself jumps in and I am caught? But still he was interested in the answer he will give. Okay let’s go, I will stand back a little and watch. And what he saw surprised him even more. He thought, he is completely mad.\nHe dropped a bucket in the well that had no bottom in it. The bucket made a great racket inside the well, made a huge noise and sank in the water. It didn’t take any time to fill up, because there was no bottom in it. Then he pulled, but got nothing. The bucket came up empty, then he threw it again. Two or three times the man watched. He said, “Brother, are you in your senses? I had come to be instructed by you: it seems you yourself are in need of instruction. What are you doing? Are you mad? Will this bucket ever be filled?”\nThe fakir said, “You have understood something? I am dropping this bucket in the well for you. The bucket of craving has no bottom. You go on filling it your whole life, it will not fill up. No one has ever filled it. There is no bottom: what can I do, what can you do? This is why there is sorrow. Then when the bucket... you make so much effort, reach the well, manage to reach the edge of the well with great difficulty, because there was a line there, a crowd. With great difficulty, somehow you get the chance to drop the bucket. You drop the bucket and it fills up too: when you look into the well you find the bucket full, you see it submerged in the water. You are in high spirits, you start pulling. You pull with great expectations and when it reaches your hand – not a drop in it!\n“How many desires have you had? How many times have you felt that now I am satisfied? But were you ever? How many times have you felt that now the bucket far away in the well is full? – by the time it reached your hand it was empty. Again and again this has happened, but still you didn’t wake up, still you weren’t startled out of your sleep?”\nHOPE BRINGS DISTRESS, DOUBT BRINGS SORROW\nOne who lives in hope this way will always be in affliction.\n... DOUBT BRINGS SORROW\nAnd there will be nothing but suffering in the life of one who is doubtful, who has not yet been able to catch hold of the thread of trust.\nDoubt can never give rise to happiness because doubt is a dilemma, a wavering, a mind in fragments. In trust the mind becomes collected, become united, becomes unfragmented. And the very nature of an unfragmented mind is bliss.\nTHESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.\nThis double affliction – of hope and of doubt – will not let up, until some master startles you, awakens you.\nTHESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.\nOne who does not run away, a master will invite with his light, let you join his radiance too, he will give you an opportunity to look inside of him. And you will see a burning light there and a shower of bliss and a taste of immortality. Then you will understand completely how it happened – it happened through trust. How it happened – it happened through becoming free of desire.\nAs I was saying, I and thou are two faces of the same coin, in the same way desire and doubt are two faces of the same coin, in the same way trust and bliss are two faces of the same coin. These things go together. But how can you know that trust and bliss are two sides of the same coin? You can know it sitting near one in whom the happening has occurred.\nBALANCE HAS BECOME THE ESSENCE OF ALL AUSTERITY AND PENANCE HAS REDUCED THE CHILDISH CUPID TO ASH,\nLOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD, ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR STOMACHS.\nThe essence of all chanting and austerities, all centering – is satsang. Without it nothing can happen. Without it no matter what you do will be the groping of a blind man. It is like a blind man shooting arrows. He cannot see the arrow, he cannot see the target. Does an arrow shot in the dark ever hit? And if it should hit it has no value.\nBALANCE HAS BECOME THE ESSENCE OF ALL AUSTERITY AND PENANCE...\nOnly through satsang is there an emergence of centering, of sanyam, which is the essence of all chanting and austerities.\nConsider this word sanyam – it means centering not restraint or control. The word sanyam has become very distorted in people’s hands. Ordinarily you call a renunciate a sanyami. This is incorrect. Neither the worldly nor the renunciate is sanyami: both are asanyami – uncentered, imbalanced. One is imbalanced in the direction of worldly enjoyment, the other is imbalanced in the direction of renunciation. The balanced, the sanyam, lives in the middle. The very meaning of the word sanyam is in the middle, balanced, even tempered.\nOne man is eating too much, he is uncentered. And another man fasts too much, he too is uncentered. He is uncentered at the other extreme. But one who eats the right amount of food, eats just as much as is necessary, neither less nor more – he is sanyami, centered.\nThe word sanyam indicates music in one’s life. Sanyam is the music of life’s veena. The strings should not be too tight, should not be too loose.\nLOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD...\nIf you meet a yogi somewhere who is centered he is worth seeing. Neither indulgent, nor renunciate. This is a problem with me, with my sannyasins. I don’t tell them to become renunciates. And for centuries you have understood that a renunciate is sanyami. This is why you think I am not teaching my sannyasins sanyam. I am teaching them nothing but sanyam, centering. I tell them: Move away from indulgence a little, don’t lean towards renunciation. Indulgence is on the left, renunciation is on the right. Truth is in between the two, in the exact middle – majjhim nikaya, the middle path. This is the golden path: living in between. Live in the world but live such that the world is not in you at all. Sit in the market and be in meditation.\nLOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD...\nYou should see this. If there is a wonder in the world worth seeing it is not the Taj Mahal, or the pyramids of Egypt, or the Great Wall of China – if there is a wonder in the world worth seeing it is a person who has come to the center, who is in sanyam, because from there arises a fragrance, a sound, that if you understand it, if it reaches your nostrils, if it gives your ear its secret, if it pierces your heart – then you will start to be transformed. A new journey will begin in your life. ‘Lead me from darkness unto light.’ You will start moving from darkness towards the light. ‘Lead me from death to immortality.’ You will start moving from death to the immortal. ‘Lead me from falsehood to the truth.’ You will start moving from the false to the truth.\nBut this happening will occur near a sanyami.\nTHESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.…\nLOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD, ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR STOMACHS.\nAnd the rest of what goes on in the name of yoga, this whole profession, is just a way of filling the belly, nothing more than that. You can see your Akhandanandas, Pakhandanandas etc, etc... Their whole employment is growing a big belly. The bigger the belly the bigger the yogi – this seems to be the definition. And the one who has defeated everyone is Nityananda, the guru of Baba Muktananda of Ganeshpuri. Have you seen his picture? Look at his picture and then read this statement of Gorakh again:\n... ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR STOMACHS.\nYou may have seen many bellies, but Nityananda’s has no equal – nothing but stomach! Have you seen his picture or not? If you haven’t seen it then definitely see it. People just go on filling up. And you call him a sannyasin, call him a mahatma.\nSanyam is music. Sanyam is a rare art. Sanyam is not a matter of forcing, sanyam is spontaneity. HOW CAN I SAY O PUNDIT, WHERE GOD IS?\nIF YOU LOOK FOR OWN SELF, THERE IS NO I, NO THOU.\nO pandits, o scholarly people. How can I explain to you in which place god is, because god is everywhere. He exists and nothing else.\nO pandits, how can I explain where god is, where is god not? IF YOU LOOK FOR OWN SELF, THERE IS\nNO I, NO THOU.\nOne thing I can say to you, if you look at yourself then you will not find any I nor any thou. And the moment there is no more I, no more thou, what will remain is god. You cannot attain god anywhere else.\nA statement of Gorakh:\nHIDE SEEING IN YOUR EYES, LISTENING IN THE EARS,\nHIDE BREATHING AT THE NOSE TIP, ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS.\nHide the flame in your eye, hide the sense of seeing. Don’t look outside, looking out you get entangled.\nHIDE SEEING IN YOUR EYES...\nHide the capacity of the eyes to see and close the eyes, so that the whole energy of seeing becomes collected inside, so you can see yourself.\n... LISTENING IN THE EARS\nAnd now don’t listen outside the ear. Now be free of what is outside the ear and listen within.\n... LISTENING IN THE EARS,\nHIDE BREATHING AT THE NOSE TIP...\nIt is enough this taking breath from outside. Now search for that moment when the outer breath stops, becomes peaceful, neither comes nor goes. Then you will experience a new life inside, you will experience a new breath.\n... ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS.\nThen nothing remains, then only the state of nirvana remains. This experience is the experience of god, this experience is liberation, this is nirvana. These are differences of name.\nONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS. HOW CAN I SAY O PUNDIT, WHERE GOD IS?\nHow can I tell you, O pandits, you are looking in scriptures: you have gone mad. You are looking on pilgrimages? You are mad. You are seeking in idols? You are mad. God is not found in such places.\nIF YOU LOOK FOR OWN SELF... look at yourself!\n... THERE IS NO I, NO THOU. There neither I remain nor you remain, no I no thou – whatever is left is god.\n... ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS. A STONE HOUSE OF GOD?\nThe idol too is made of stone. A GOD OF STONE?\nThe temple is stone, the idol is stone.\nHOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH WORSHIPPING STONE?\nAnd endlessly worshipping stone you think a fountain of love will spring up in you heart?\nGuard this statement deep in your heart. This calamity has happened so clearly in this country it is not necessary to prove it. India has become so stone-hearted, the whole cause is the worship of stones. If you worship stone you become stone. Worship with a little understanding, because what you worship becomes the destination of your life. What you worship becomes an ideal for you. What you worship, you will start to become like. Think before you worship.\nA STONE HOUSE OF GOD, A GOD OF STONE? HOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH WORSHIPPING STONE?\nAnd how will prayer arise within you? How will love be awakened? How will the lamp of love be born? A stone is your god, your temple is of stone, you too will become stone. The devotee whose god is stone will not remain human for long, he will become stone.\nIn this country you will see a very miraculous thing. People are worshipping a lot, they are praying – and they are completely stonelike. There is no kindness, no compassion, no love. Kindness, compassion and love are completely gone. No one has anything to do with anyone else. If someone is dying or living it is no one’s business. And people have discovered great doctrines: that each one is suffering the fruits of his own karma, what should we do? – we are on our way to worship in\nthe temple. People are suffering the fruits of their own karma. As you have done so you will suffer. As you have sown so you will reap. If your house catches fire, sometime you must have set fire to someone else’s house. Now suffer it, who will put it out? You are dying of starvation, die, you must have caused someone to starve in a past life, so now you are suffering the fruit.\nThese are tricks. These are the snares of doctrine. And remember, just as spiders spinning webs to catch flies, won’t sit on their web proclaiming, “Come, flies and be caught, I will eat you.” Will any flies be caught then? When a spider spins a web he says to the flies, “Come flies, drink some tea, have breakfast... Come by sometime, lets get together. We’ll have satsang, discuss a couple of things.” Then the flies will be caught. And if they are caught, they are caught.\nGreat spider webs of religious doctrine are spread all around you. If you are caught in them you will writhe in agony, the spiders will suck you. These spiders have become your religious teachers, pandits, priests. They have become ones who direct your life, great seers of life. They are giving you paths, they show you the way – they who don’t know any path. Those who haven’t had any experience of themselves are talking about the soul, talking about god. Empty words, false words. There is no breath in their words, nor is a there a beating heart.\nA STONE HOUSE OF GOD, A GOD OF STONE? HOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH WORSHIPPING STONE?\nOFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?\nYou see how people pick flowers, living flowers. Flowers have just blossomed, they were just dancing in the wind. They were just spreading their fragrance to the sky. They were just having a dialogue with the rays of the sun. They were so happy, so ecstatic. Then they were picked. People go out in the morning to pick them. Picked, they are offered in the temple. Living flowers are murdered, and offered up to a stone? What was already offered to existence you steal and offer to a stone?\nHe is right:\nOFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?\nHow insane you are! If you brought stones and offered them to flowers okay, but don’t destroy flowers. And people say, “No-no, we love flowers very much, this is why we pick them.”\nA friend wanted to pick a flower and give it to George Bernard Shaw. They were strolling together in a garden. The friend’s garden, the flowers... He saw Bernard Shaw standing near the flowers overwhelmed, absorbed... The friend started to pick. Bernard Shaw said, “Stop! Stop! Don’t pick them.”\nHe said, “Don’t you like the flowers?”\nBernard Shaw said, “I like them very much, they are very lovely.” So he said, “That’s why I am picking them.”\nHe said, “This is too much! If a child is lovely do you break its neck and make a bouquet? If a flower is lovely how can you pick it? How are you able to do it? You don’t cut children’s heads to decorate your bouquets, putting the head of the child on the table, saying look he is our son, how lovely! So why do you pick flowers?”\nGorakh is right:\nOFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?\nI lived in Jabalpur for many years. I used to keep a lovely garden. Many flowers bloomed there. People started coming in the morning to pick flowers. They came with tilak and sandalwood paste on their foreheads, chanting Rama-Rama, Rama-Rama. So I said, “Don’t pick the flowers.”\nThey said, “But we are picking them for worship. Everyone has the right to pick flowers for worship.” I said, “If you are picking them for any other reason I can give them, but not for worship.”\nThey said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “For worship I absolutely cannot give, because they are already worshipping. Don’t disturb their worship. They are offered up to god. Yes, if you have fallen in love with some woman and you want to offer her a flower, good, take it. At least offer it to the living.”\n“No,” they said, “We are going to the temple of the goddess.”\nI said, “If you offer them to a living goddess you can pick them, but they are not for any temple- shlemple.”\nThen I had a sign put up, saying, “If you want flowers for anything except worship, pick them. But for worship it is not allowed.”\nIn this garden too, flowers are blooming, they wither just where they bloom. They have been offered to existence right where they are. Why pick them?\nOFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS? HOW CAN YOU SWIM THE INFINITE THROUGH SUCH SINFUL ACTS?\nHow to swim across this difficult ocean with these false acts? with these useless actions? with these unconscious activities?\nBATHING IN TIRTHA AFTER TIRTHA...\nHow many pilgrimage places, how many bathing ghats, have you bathed at?\n... HOW CAN THE INNER BE PENETRATED THROUGH OUTER CLEANSING?\nAnd you have washed the body outside, how will it penetrate inside? When will you wash the inside? The inside will be washed at only one tirtha – when you find a bathing ghat of satsang, of sitting with the master. Satsang is the only lake where an inner bath happens.\nADINATH MY GRANDSON, MACHINDRANATH MY SON, GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS OFFSPRING.\nA very amazing statement. You will be surprised hearing it. He is saying...\nAdinath is a unique mythical name in India’s history. I say mythical, not historical, because history doesn’t account for such things. But Adinath is like the source of the Ganges. The Jainas consider Adinath their first master, their first tirthankara. Rishabdev and Adinath are his names. He is the first tirthankara: hence ‘Adi-nath’ – the ‘original master’, the one who was first, the one who began it. The Jaina tradition was born from Adinath.\nIn the Rig Veda Adinath is mentioned with great respect, an extremely respectful description. Hence he is given total respect in the Hindu tradition too. The Hindu tradition has not given any respect to Mahavira. They have not even mentioned his name. If there were no Jaina and Buddhist scriptures it would not be known that Mahavira ever existed. But Adinath has been given great respect. It appears that Jaina and Hindu traditions became separate later on. At the time of Adinath they must have been one. No distinction had been made yet. This is why the description in the Rig Veda indicates respect, great respect. And he is the first tirthankara of the Jainas. He is the very foundation of their whole religion.\nTantrikas also maintain that Tantra began with Adinath. And Siddha Yogis also maintain that Adinath is their first guru. Hence Adinath appears to be the original source. As if all the traditions of this country emerged and flowed from this one individual.\nBut Gorakh’s statement is very shocking. Gorakh says:\nADINATH MY GRANDSON!\nAdinath is my grandson.\n... MACHINDRANATH MY SON!\nAnd my guru - his master was Machindranath – is my son.\n... GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS OFFSPRING.\nSeeing my sons and daughters, seeing my sons and grandsons I am very happy.\nAs we come closer and closer to the time of Kabir, statements like this began to be called ulatbansi, reversed flutes. It is a very lovely statement! Jesus too has a statement like this. Someone asked Jesus: “On what authority do you speak?”\nAnd Jesus said, “On what authority? Before Abraham existed, I am.”\nAbraham has the same place in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions as Adinath has in Jaina, Hindu and Buddhist tradition. Abraham is the first man of the Jewish tradition. Later Christianity\nemerged from him. Later Islam emerged from him. Jesus’ statement is very wonderful. Jesus says: “On what authority? Before Abraham I am.”\nThe questioner said, “You are trying to startle me. Are you talking senses? Thousands of years have passed since Abraham existed.”\nJesus said, “Yes, I know, but I precede him.”\nWhat could Jesus mean? Jesus is saying that which is at my center of centers, that which is the life of my life, existed before anything had happened. When existence had not yet begun, when the sunrise of existence had not happened, since then I am.\nAnd whenever someone knows it, then everything else is afterwards. One who has known his own nature has known god, he has known the root of existence. And the root is certainly before everything. Adinath was after him, Abraham was after him.\nGorakh it saying the same. A profound joke, a lovely jest. Gorakh is saying since I have known myself, since then I have known that everything else happened after me. Remember ‘me’ does not mean Gorakh. Me has the same meaning as Krishna means in the Geeta. Drop all religion Arjuna, and come to my feet. This my feet does not mean come to the feet of Krishna. I am the one. Who is that ‘I am the one’? Not Krishna. That one is manifest in Krishna, that one is also manifest in Arjuna. That one is always being manifested and will always be manifested. That same has manifested in me, that same has manifested in you. If someone finds out, he becomes a buddha and if someone does not find out he remains sleeping. This is the only difference between buddhas and non-buddhas. There is no other difference. One has awakened, the other is sleeping. But the one who is sleeping is just as much god as the awakened. There isn’t a grain of difference. There is no qualitative difference.\nHe is revealing this fact:\nADINATH MY GRANDSON...\nWhat should I say about myself? Since I have known myself, I have seen myself, what has happened? Now it appears to me that even Adinath happened after me.\nADINATH MY GRANDSON, MACHINDRANATH MY SON...\nAnd perhaps Adinath you have quite forgotten already, you don’t even remember him. But Machindranath, who is my master – and who was just alive – he is my son.\n... GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS OFFSPRING.\nAnd this whole existence is my own offspring. Seeing this Gorakh Avadhut is very happy. There is another saying of Gorakh, Narendra had just asked about it yesterday. That saying is also lovely:\nAVADHU, CALL GOD MY DISCIPLE, CALL MACHHINDRA MY GRANDSON,\nLEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED, COMPASSIONATELY I REVERSE THE ORDER.\nO Avadhut, Shiva is my chela, my disciple, god himself is my disciple. O Avadhut, existence is my disciple, Machindranath my grandson, meaning a disciple of a disciple. I have no need to establish myself as a master because I am god in person. But from the fear that the unenlightened people that follow me will not be able to have faith in a yogi without a guru, I have made Machindranath my guru, while in reality the order is reverse, because Machindranath himself is my disciple.\nLEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED...\nSo that people with no master don’t start making their own declarations that they have reached. So that hollow people don’t start making false declarations, this is the reason.\nLEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED...\nSo that the whole earth doesn’t go into annihilation.\n... COMPASSIONATELY I REVERSE THE ORDER.\nThis is why I have made a reversal. I have made my own son my father. I have made my own disciple my master, so that for unenlightened people an indication remains, that without a master there is no enlightenment.\nAnd whoever becomes enlightened, this is their experience:\nAVADHU, ISHVAR MY CHELA, BHANINJAY AND MACHINDRA MY GRANDSONS,\nWhoever is enlightened becomes the form of the divine. One who has known himself has become the ultimate. What he knows he becomes. Then everything else comes after him. He has gone beyond time, he has gone outside of time and place. He is first, he is last. He is the very first, he is also the very last. In reality there is just one, not two. Who is guru and who is chela? Who is bhakta, who is bhagwan? Who is devotee, who god? Not even this distinction remains, nor should it remain. Only in this identity is the showering of bliss, the experience of the immortal.\nBut you will have to disappear before this. As you are you are egotistical, this ego state you will have to say good by to.\nDIE, O YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND SAW.\nEnough for today?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"14373","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/death_is_divine/>Death is Divine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Wander alone</h1><div class=post-meta>68 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;14373 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Death_is_Divine/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

from, without thinking in which direction. He does not even think ‘Who
am I?’ but goes on running. What will the result of this hard running
be? What will we get?</p><p><br></p><p>what rhyme or reason in going on like this?</p><p><br></p><p>Stop a little. Reconsider it for once: ‘Who am I?’ Let this question
awaken, because when you know the answer to this question in your
depths, when the arrow of this question pierces your soul the mystery of
life lifts its veil.</p><p><br></p><p>But people sitting in temples, mosques, and churches in the name of
religion don’t stop either. They just keep on going. Their running
continues. You want to have money, they want to have heaven. You want to
have power, they want to have god. But where there is wanting, there is
madness. And where there is wanting, there is rivalry. Where there is
wanting there is competition, the whole marketplace. Where there is
wanting there is fear – I shouldn’t be defeated anywhere, no one should
win before me. Where there is wanting there is condemnation, there is
opposition. Where there is wanting there is struggle, there is tension.
As soon as wanting is gone an incomparable relaxation comes into life.
As soon as wanting goes the days of autumn are gone, spring has
come.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is religious? Not one who has changed his desire, rather one who
has understood desire. Wanting makes you run, run irrelevantly, run
uselessly, run meaninglessly, run for the sake of running. Then running
becomes a habit. Man just goes on running. Running continues until he
falls</p><p>into his grave. He never reaches anywhere. After all this running we
reach only to our grave. Nothing remains in our hands. Perhaps we had
brought something, that too we let slip through our fingers. But running
latches on to the mind so tightly that even if we awaken from the
meaninglessness of running, we will start running again. We are so bound
in chains that even when we are tortured by the agony of chains, we
caste new chains. It may be that you caste golden chains in place of
iron ones. And it may also be that you stud your golden chains with
diamonds and jewels. But chains are chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Here certainly the worldly are bound, here the so called spiritual
people are also bound. A free person is one who has no wanting. He
doesn’t want god. He doesn’t even want heaven. One who has understood
the meaninglessness of wanting, that wanting takes one astray, makes one
run. One who has understood the feverishness of wanting, one who has
understood the madness of wanting, one who has seen the whole eye of
wanting and has let desire drop and not taken up any new desire – one
who becomes so empty of wanting attains god. God is already attained.
Wanting goes and immediately the eyes open. Desire is destroyed and
immediately god is incarnated. He was hidden, waiting for desire to get
out of the way so he could appear face to face. It is not only that you
are eager for his sight and touch, he too is eager for your sight and
touch. But a wall of wanting stands in between.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the meaning of wanting? Wanting means, I don’t want to be as
I am, I want to be something else. Wanting means, I don’t want to be
where I am, I want to be somewhere else. Wanting means: today? – today I
am not happy, tomorrow I will be happy. Wanting says: move, run,
reach.</p><p><br></p><p>Dropping wanting means, I am satisfied where I am, I am blissful as I
am, there is no desire to be anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>All desires are desires to be something else. Hence all desires
deprive you of your center. As soon as wanting is gone you become
enthroned in your center. As soon as you have become enthroned in your
center the devotee is god.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING
DRUGS? BY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL, SHREE GORAKH RAJA SPEAKS PLAIN
TRUTH. YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS...</p><p>He says, if you become a yogi but still condemn others then yoga has
been lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, a few things have to be understood. The first thing, it is
necessary to understand the difference between condemnation and
criticism. Gorakh also makes criticisms. This too is a critical sutra.
He is saying...</p><p><br></p><p>YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING
DRUGS?</p><p><br></p><p>... those who become yogis and condemn others, eat fish and meat,
drink and smoke drugs, such people numbering in the thousands, fall into
hell.</p><p>BY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL...</p><p><br></p><p>Such people exist in vast numbers and fall into hell. Gorakh says, I
am telling you the truth: listen.</p><p><br></p><p>This does contain criticism, but there is no condemnation in it. The
difference between criticism and condemnation is subtle and if it is not
understood there can be misunderstanding. Buddha criticized and so did
Mahavira. Christ criticized and Mohammed also. There has never been a
master on the earth who did not criticize. What is the difference?</p><p><br></p><p>The difference between criticism and condemnation is subtle.
Sometimes condemnation can appear like criticism and sometimes criticism
can appear like condemnation. There is a very close relationship. Their
form and color are similar but their soul is very different. Criticism
is out of compassion, condemnation is out of hatred. Criticism is to
awaken, condemnation is to destroy. The objective of criticism is
discovery, the objective of condemnation is to demolish the other’s ego,
to cover them with dirt, to trample them underfoot. The objective of
condemnation is to deliver a blow to the other’s being, to wound. The
objective of criticism is to seek the truth. The diamond has fallen in
the dirt, how can we wash it, how can we cleanse it.</p><p><br></p><p>Criticism is utterly friendly, no matter how hard it is, still it
contains friendliness. And condemnation no matter how sweet it is, no
matter how pleasant it is, contains poison. Poison can be given only
covered in sugar.</p><p><br></p><p>Condemnation arises from egotism: I am greater than you, I am going
to make you look small. Criticism is not concerned with the ego.
Criticism is not concerned with me versus you.</p><p><br></p><p>Criticism is an exploration into what truth is, into how is truth is.
Criticism can be very hard because a sword sometimes must be used to cut
falsehood. There are stones of falsehood so the hammers and chisels of
truth have to prepare them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately Gorakh is making blows with hammer and chisel. And after
Gorakh comes Kabir who keeps a sharper blade – on his sword there is
more of an edge. Kabir’s blows are such that they cut to bits. But they
don’t cut you to bits, they cut your falseness. When you attack a thief
it is condemnation and when you attack stealing it is criticism. When
you start hating the sinner it is condemnation and when you hate the sin
it is criticism.</p><p><br></p><p>A yogi cannot condemn. Only a completely unconscious person enjoys
condemning. What is the psychology of condemning? Most people in the
world have fallen into condemning. What is its psychology? Its
psychology is clear and very simple. Every person wants the status for
his ego that I am the greatest. It is very difficult to prove this. It
is difficult to prove that I am the greatest because everyone else is
trying to prove it. And they are all trying to prove only one thing that
they are the greatest. How many people can be the greatest? Such fierce
fighting ensues that it is almost impossible to win. Who can win? Every
person will fight against billions of others. Defeat is certain. In
this, all will be defeated. In this, no one can ascend. So the mind
finds an easy remedy. The mind says: it may be difficult to prove that I
am the greatest but it is easy to prove that no one is greater than
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it is always very difficult to prove the affirmative of
anything. A negative statement is always easy. For instance if you want
to prove that god exists it is very difficult. Your life will have</p><p>to pass through the fire of austerities. Even then it is unknown when
the proof will happen – in this lifetime, in many lives? But that god
does not exist can be proven right now. There is no problem. Only a
little skill in argument is needed. To be an atheist is not a matter of
great proficiency, of great intelligence. The most idiotic of idiots can
be an atheist.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a famous story by Turgenev: THE GREAT FOOL. In a village
there was a fool. He was very upset because no matter what he said
people laughed at him. People had decided he was a blithering idiot.
Even when he said something right people still laughed at him. He lived
cowering, not daring even to speak. If he didn’t speak people laughed,
if he spoke people laughed. If he did something people laughed, if he
didn’t do anything people laughed. A monk came to the village. That
night the fool fell at the monk’s feet and said, “Give me some blessing.
is my whole life to be spent shrinking and cowering like this? Will I
die a blithering idiot? Is there no way I can become a little
intelligent?”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “There is a way. Follow this sutra: condemn
everything.” He said, “What will happen through condemning?”</p><p>The monk said, “You do it for seven days then come again to me.” The
fool asked, “How should I condemn?</p><p>The monk said, “Whatever anyone says make a negative statement. For
instance if someone says look what a beautiful sun is coming out, you
say what’s beautiful about it? Prove it. Where is the beauty? What
beauty? It comes out everyday, it has been coming out for billions of
years. It is a globe of fire – what beauty? If someone says look Jesus’
words are so lovely, you immediately jump on him saying what is so
lovely in them? What is so special about them? What’s new in them? The
same thing has always been said, it is all thrashed over. It is all
stale, all borrowed. You just deny. Someone says, looking at a beautiful
woman, what a beautiful woman. You say: what of it? So what if her nose
is a little longer? So what if her skin is a little whiter? Lepers are
white too. What beauty? Prove it. You demand proof from everyone and
remember to always remain in the negative. Put them in the positive, you
remain in the negative. Come to me after seven days.”</p><p><br></p><p>After seven days when the idiot came, he did not come alone, many had
become his disciples. They came on ahead. They had hung flower garlands
around his neck. A band was playing. He said to the monk, “The device
worked. The whole village was forced to be silent. Wherever I went
people lowered their heads. The news spread among the people that I am a
great genius. No one could win against me. Now what should I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Now don’t do anything, just remain with this. If you want
to save your intellect never fall into the positive. If someone speaks
of god then immediately bring in atheism. Whatever is said, always make
a negative statement. No one will be able to defeat you because to
disprove a negative statement is very difficult. To prove a positive
statement is very difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>To affirm god great intelligence is needed, a very subtle sensitivity
is needed. Total wakefulness of the heart is needed. A purified state of
consciousness is needed. A little light is needed within. But to deny
god nothing is needed. In denying god there is no commitment. This is
why people in the world condemn.</p><p>The psychology of condemnation is cheap psychology, an easy way out.
Your genius will be proven by it. And there is no cost. “Using neither
turmeric nor alum the dye came out fine.” There is no cost at all. There
is no need to go anywhere to learn. There is no need for satsang. This
is why everyone is skillful at condemning.</p><p><br></p><p>You find people everywhere enjoying the mood of condemnation. Who
knows, why did those who numbered the nine rasas, the nine dramatic
moods leave out the mood of condemnation? All the other moods come only
now and again, the mood of condemnation comes to people every day from
morning till night. You read the newspaper to enjoy the feeling of
condemnation. When someone is being condemned you immediately cock your
ears and start listening. If someone comes and says that the neighbor’s
woman has eloped with someone, how attentive you become! Your attention
is so focused in that moment that you forget all matters of the world.
You start digging, asking, “Say something more, tell what happened next.
Elaborate a little, don’t make it so brief. Where were they eloping to,
tell the whole story before you go. Sit down and have some tea.” You
roll out the red carpet.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever you notice condemnation happening you enjoy. You enjoy
because another person is being made small and in his becoming smaller
you inwardly experience I am bigger. This is why if a beggar slips and
falls on a banana peel on the street there is not so much enjoyment as
when an emperor slips and falls on a banana peel. The heart becomes
happy – what Mulla Nasruddin calls the experience of the heart becoming
garden-garden.</p><p><br></p><p>When he said this to me this the first time I was surprised and I
asked him, “What is this ’garden- garden?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Oh, it is just the English translation of our Hindi
expression ‘baag-baag ho jaana’.”</p><p><br></p><p>If some emperor slips and falls, how happy the mind becomes. When
when you hear the news that the prime minister or the president has been
caught doing some illegal activity, how the joy of condemnation spreads.
What’s the point? Why should anyone be concerned with it? If the prime
minister has fallen in love with some woman, enough... As if a very rare
incident has occurred. So much interest spreads, people become so eager.
This tells only one thing about what is inside you, indicates only one
thing: that you were waiting for someone to get caught, to fall
somewhere, for a foot to slip on a banana peel, for him to fall flat.
This was your heart’s desire.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why people become eager and excited to remove someone from
power when he has been in office for four or five years. It is too long,
this man must fall. Then trivial things are blown out of proportion and
spread around. And people are ready to believe them.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you noticed something strange, if you praise someone no one is
ready to listen, no one is ready to accept it. If you say, “Look at such
and such person. He has become a great being.” They will say, “We have
seen all these great souls, these mahatmas! There is no great soul, nor
has there ever been. It’s all deception. Some trick is happening. Just
wait, stop a little, when he is caught you will know. We have seen many
falling.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if someone says to you that such and such person is stealing,
such and such person is deceiving, such and such person has taken a
bribe you will never deny it saying, no-no, how could it be? You</p><p>will immediately agree, as if you had already known it. We have
accepted that except ourselves people are all bad. Some have been found
out. Others have not been found out and will be sometime. But except for
us all people are bad. This is our preconceived belief. Whatever
supports our preconceived belief we agree with immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Our state is such that if someone says to you, look at such and such
man, he is playing flute so nicely, you will say: “What bad flute
playing! He’s a thief, depraved, a scoundrel.” As if being a scoundrel
and depraved and a thief prevents him from playing flute. You will
immediately condemn saying, “What lousy flute playing, what’s special
about his flute? We know him well enough. We know his father and
grandfathers too. How can he play flute?”</p><p><br></p><p>But the reverse statement you will never hear – when someone says,
look, that man is a thief, a cheat, depraved; and you say, “No, how can
it be? Because he plays such lovely flute. No-no, it cannot be. A man
who plays such lovely flute a thief? depraved? – how is it
possible?”</p><p><br></p><p>You will never speak this way. It is against your ego. It is
condemnation that inflates your ego. This is why people praise very
reluctantly – they do it very unwillingly, as if compelled. They do it
when there is something to get by praising. This is why superficially
they praise, but beneath they are taking revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a case in court. A political leader had initiated a
defamation case against a man. The man, in a restaurant where fifty or
sixty people were present, had called the politician a son-of-an- owl.
Naturally the politician became angry. Son-of-an-owl! I will get him
back good.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was standing right next to the politician when he was
called a son-of-an-owl. So he said, “Mulla, you will have to be a
witness. He said it in front of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will certainly be a witness, I am an eye witness. He
insulted you just in front of me. I was standing next to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Witnesses were called in court. The magistrate asked Mulla Nasruddin,
“Fifty people were there, and the man being charged with making insults
says: ‘I didn’t say it to anyone in particular. Yes, I used the word
son-of-an-owl. But fifty or sixty people were there. I wasn’t
implicating the politician when I said this.’ What proof do you have
Nasruddin that he said it implying the politician?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “I know that there were fifty or sixty people there,
but there was no son-of-an-owl except the politician.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what to do? Even his witness is saying it. You hope that those in
power, in office, those who have money will fall flat. Your heart will
get great comfort from this. In the world whenever someone’s downfall
happens, people share great comfort, much lightness comes. People are
waiting for someone’s character to be corrupted. They are greatly
supporting it. To create character is very difficult. To bring dignity
to one’s life is difficult, to bring greatness is difficult. But if you
want to take away someone’s greatness it is easy to spread and inflate
rumors about him. The more you talk badly of him the more you feel good
inside. This is the psychology of condemnation – it is the shadow of ego
and the nourishment of ego also.</p><p>But this does not mean that I am telling you to live blindly. Or that
Gorakh is telling you to live blindly. To remain silent when you see
something wrong: I am not saying this, nor is Gorakh saying it. If
Gorakh were saying this then what he has said here could not be said.
Remember this, he has seen this wrong, hasn’t he? He has seen a yogi and
condemning, a yogi and consuming fish, meat and drugs. So he says they
will fall into hell. Don’t take it as condemnation. There is no
condemnation at all in it. There is natural compassion in it, there is
spontaneous sympathy in it. It is not his intent to make them look
lower. In reality it his desire that they rise higher, his desire that
they awaken.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes one who comes to awaken seems like an enemy. Sometimes it
happens that you tell someone, “Brother, wake me up in the morning, I
have to catch a train at four o’clock. And anyway you get up at three,
at the hour of Brahma. Please get me up.”</p><p><br></p><p>He comes to get you up at three o’clock, you are swearing at him
under your breath – at the man that you told to wake you up at three –
saying, this rude fellow has come, this bastard. I told him – it was a
mistake – but there is no need to go through with a mistake, how to get
rid of this knave? And if he starts to pull on you to get you up there
can be a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a famous German thinker, Immanuel Kant. He used to keep a
servant. He had great difficulty in getting up in the morning. The
servant’s whole job was this: to wake him up even if he fights. So the
servant was hit, he hired the servant for this! Many servants had quit
and left saying, what kind of arrangement is this? But he said this is
what I have hired you for. Don’t worry about it, I am not saying not to
strike back if I hit you.</p><p><br></p><p>There are all kinds of people! In the West now an electric blanket is
made that you can set an alarm on, it has a clock attached and at
exactly five o’clock in the morning an electric shock... An arrangement
had to be made for those who cannot get up. A shock is applied and you
leap up. An ordinary alarm won’t work, people just turn it off. They
throw the clock on the floor. Their own clock! Then they regret later
that it was smashed, a fifty rupee loss. They themselves set the alarm,
they themselves smash the clock. Something had to be done for them.</p><p><br></p><p>One who awakens does not seem loving because at that time you are
lost in sweet slumber. It may be that you are seeing a sweet dream. It
may be that at just that very moment you were going to meet Cleopatra,
or Hema Malini was just coming. You were almost going to embrace and
this fellow came, or the alarm went off. Will anyone put up with such a
clock?</p><p><br></p><p>This is why we have been able to accept buddhas only with great
difficulty. We can accept them only grudgingly. How can the people who
break your dreams seem loving to you? You will be angry. Do not think
that a yogi should not be critical, who else will? He has earned the
right. But he will not condemn. In his eyes you will not be disgraced.
His voice may be hard. His voice may be very sharp. His words may be
razor like. They should be.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir has said,</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir stands in the market, stout staff in hand. “Burn down your
house, and come along with me.”</p><p>If you are ready to set fire to your own house, come with me. And he
is standing with a staff! He won’t even let you look back, otherwise
he’ll smash your head.</p><p><br></p><p>A yogi can be hard. But hard towards your defects, not towards you.
He has great compassion towards you, great love. This is why sometimes
there can be confusion. Sometimes you can be mistaken. But understand
the distinction clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS...</p><p><br></p><p>You have become a yogi and you are condemning others?</p><p><br></p><p>... EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING DRUGS?</p><p><br></p><p>And still you haven’t let go of meat, haven’t let go of wine? And you
still go on drowning in intoxicating substances like marijuana and
ganja?</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one thing: those who are awake are against your wine, your
meat and liquor for a different reason. You also may be against them,
but your reason is different. You say don’t drink wine because it is a
useless loss of money, because your health will be ruined. Don’t drink
because your wife and kids will die of starvation. These reasons won’t
stay with you long.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance if you have wealth in abundance and your wife and kids
won’t die of starvation from your meat eating and drinking alcohol, then
what is the problem? This teaching must be for the poor. For the rich?
No, there won’t be any hindrance for them. Then this becomes a
conditional teaching. This teaching says that the body will be ruined,
but the body will be ruined at any rate. What difference is a day or two
earlier or a day or two later? If you die at eighty or you die at
seventy... it is better that you die at seventy, to leave the space
empty for someone else those ten years. As it is there is too little
space in the world. The crowd goes on growing, there is no space left to
even wave ones hand. The sooner you leave the better. So if you live ten
years longer, the world gets no benefit from it, nor is it a benediction
for mankind. And if you die ten years earlier or ten years later what is
the difference? If you stay ten years more, you will exploit a few more
people, you will amass a little more money, fill your treasury a little
more. People will be more bothered by you, what else? What more has your
life been? There was no harmony, there was no coherence, there was no
music. What will you do if you live longer?</p><p><br></p><p>These arguments do not work. And these arguments are not even true,
because alcoholics are seen living long. An alcoholic doesn’t die
quickly. If to die sooner or to die later is decisive then it is a great
problem. Shankaracharya died at the age of thirty-three. Does it mean
that one should avoid religion? Vivekananda died at age thirty-four.
What does it mean? It means, “Brother, be careful! Don’t get involved in
religion. Did you see the fate of Vivekananda? Did you see poor
Shankaracharya, dying while still so young? This is no way to live a
long life.”</p><p><br></p><p>In a BBC interview recently someone asked Morarji Desai, “What do you
think about Churchill? because he drank a lot, smoked cigarettes, drank
wine, ate meat. He never got up at the predawn hour of Brahma, never got
up before nine or ten o’clock, but he lived long.” So Morarji Desai said
he is an exception. And Morarji Desai thinks that he is living long due
to drinking his own urine. But Churchill is an exception!</p><p>I have heard, Mulla Nasruddin has turned eighty years old, but even
now he comes in first in swimming. So journalists came to his house. His
eightieth birthday was being celebrated. They asked, “You have just
turned eighty, what is your secret? How do you still come first in
swimming? – even the young are defeated by you.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he said, “It is because I never drank wine, never ate meat, never
chased after women. I was never addicted to anything. This is the
reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>The interviewers were impressed. But then Mulla said, “You needn’t be
too much impressed by this. I am nothing. My father has reached a
hundred, but in horse riding he has no equal. I also cannot equal him at
horse riding, nor can the youngest of the young. And he drinks wine,
pardon me,” Mulla said, “but he drinks wine and eats meat.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the journalists asked, “We want to meet your father. This is very
surprising thing that he drinks wine, eats meat, is a hundred years old
and no one can equal him at horse riding. Your family seems to be really
marvellous. Where is your father, we want to meet this man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, “It is not possible, because my father has gone
to walk in my grandfather’s wedding procession.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandfather’s wedding?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Mulla said, “Yes, he had to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your grandfather is getting married?” the people asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “Not by choice, he had to. The woman is pregnant.” “How
old is your grandfather?”</p><p>“One hundred and twenty years.”</p><p><br></p><p>What conclusion will you reach? How will you reach it? Alcoholics
live long. By giving this kind of argument you cannot save anybody from
drinking. These arguments are hollow. There is no strength in these
arguments. This is why arguments continue and people continue drinking
wine, continue smoking cigarettes, continue eating meat. Everything goes
right on. This argument continues and everything else continues. No
connection is ever created between these arguments and their way of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>When the enlightened say, when a man like Gorakh says don’t drink
wine his reason is very different. It is not because you will live
longer. Even if you live longer what will you do? What is the value of
living? Nor is it because you will be healthier. Health has no great
spiritual value. A sick man can attain god. And it is possible that a
healthy man cannot attain god because he remains entangled in the world
on account of his good health, thinking, “Now I am healthy. I will
remember Rama in the end, right now I will enjoy. This life is only four
days. Right now I will enjoy.”</p><p><br></p><p>No, these hollow principles are not any help. Then why does a person
like Gorakh say it? His reason for saying it is very unique. You will be
surprised to know it.</p><p>I also want you to be free of wine, but my reason is not the same as
Morarji Desai. I want you to be free of wine because there is a greater
wine. If you remain entangled with this wine then you will never be able
to drink that higher wine. I want to take you to the real wine hall,
this is why I want to take you out of the false wine hall.</p><p><br></p><p>God is wine and such a wine that one who drinks it, drinks it
forever. And such a self-forgetfulness that it comes and stays. And such
a high that it is never broken. What you buy from the market and drink,
if you drink it at night by morning the high will break. Then the same
uneasiness, the same tension, the same worries. They can be forgotten
for a little while drowning in alcohol but they cannot be destroyed.
There is another wine where worries are destroyed. I want to give you
this wine. Meditation is wine, prayer is wine. And when a temple is
alive its style is that of a wine hall.</p><p><br></p><p>I too want that you do not drink wine, but my reason is very
paradoxical. I want it because if you remain entwined in the lower wine,
then when will you drink the higher wine? When will you drink the real
wine? Those who go on drinking water from dirty ponds at the side of the
road, will they make the pilgrimage to the lake of consciousness or not?
Will they swallow that clear, crystal clear, water down their throat or
not?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t tell you to leave wine because I am a moralist, or because
drinking wine is committing a great sin. What sin? Wine is purely
vegetarian – the essential juice of the grape. What sin can this be?
There is no sin from eating grapes, how can there be from drinking wine?
You will not go to hell by drinking wine. But yes, by drinking wine you
will be unable to receive the heavenly wine. You will remain deprived of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I want the pebbles and stones to drop from your hands because a
diamond mine is present. Why are you filling your bag with pebbles and
stones? Morarji Desai and my statements are as different as earth and
sky. His enmity is with your pebbles and stones. He says drop pebbles
and stones, pebbles and stones are bad. I say I have no enmity with
pebbles and stones. But there are diamonds and jewels. If your bag
remains filled with pebbles and stones then diamonds and jewels will
remain lying where they are. They are your birth right to attain, you
should attain them, your destiny will never be fulfilled without
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the difference, the difference is fundamental. I also say
drop eating meat, but not because you will go to hell if you eat meat,
not because if you eat meat it will be violence. I have no concern with
these small things. If everyone who eats meat goes to hell then Jesus
must be in hell. Ramakrishna Paramahansa must also be in hell – can a
Bengali exist without fish? Without fish and boiled rice they cannot
even exist. Ramakrishna Paramahansa kept on eating fish, he must be in
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>These are trivial things. They have no value. But this much is
certainly proven by them: that Ramakrishna Paramahansa’s sensitivity
never became as deep as it could have. A small veil remained. His heart
did not become as full of love as it could have. A little soot remained.
Not that he went to hell, but there could have been another experience
of beauty which he remained deprived of.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that Jesus will go to hell. But there remained a little something
missing in his understanding of life, a thorn remained. That thorn too
could have come out, should have come out. And it seems to</p><p>me that if Jesus had lived longer... he died young, was murdered...
then perhaps the thorn would have come out. He was young. And where he
was born they were all meat eaters. If he had grown a little older, his
awareness had deepened, if his experience of the presence of god had
become more and more solid, then certainly he would have dropped eating
meat. In the ultimate state, when god starts appearing everywhere, it is
impossible to think of destroying someone’s life for food.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t say it because meat eating is a sin, that in consequence
of this sin you will be suffering in hell. Rather I say it because
eating meat will decrease your sensitivity. It will take away the
subtlety of your sensitivity. The pure music that could arise from
within you will not be able to arise. You have put such thick and coarse
strings on your veena. There will be music, song will arise, but you
have put on thick, rough, cheap strings, when fine, subtle, aristocratic
strings were available. You have mistreated your veena. Not that you
will fall into hell, because you have put coarse strings on your
veena.</p><p><br></p><p>And note, don’t fall into the illusion that when you eat meat you
have killed someone. No one can die. Hence it is not a sin that you have
killed something. Death does not exist here. There is no way to kill
anything. You only took away the body of a being. That being will take a
new body. The question is not of killing, the question is can you take
its body? The question is for you. That being will take a new body, take
a new womb. No one dies. Krishna says, “Na hanyate hanyamane sharire.”
The soul does not die when the body is killed. But the question is for
you. You have shown insensitivity. There is not heartfulness inside of
you. You remain a little stonelike, you are not soft. And if you are not
soft your inner lotus will not blossom. Or will remain half blossomed.
Or one or two petals will remain unblossomed.</p><p><br></p><p>In the highest state of consciousness meat eating is not possible.
And those who want the highest state of consciousness should remain
aware of this.</p><p><br></p><p>So Gorakh says rightly:</p><p><br></p><p>YOGIS STILL CONDEMNING OTHERS, EATING MEAT, DRINKING WINE, TAKING
DRUGS? BY THE HUNDREDS THEY GO TO HELL...</p><p>I have seen thousands of people going to hell this way.</p><p><br></p><p>... SHREE GORAKH RAJA SPEAKS PLAIN TRUTH.</p><p><br></p><p>I am speaking the truth, I am not condemning anyone. I am simply
submitting what the fact is. And a revolution begins in the life of one
who listens to the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Rahim is in a quandary, feet in both worlds,</p><p><br></p><p>Seeking truth the world is lost, moving false Rama is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment of revolution comes in the life of one who has heard the
truth, understood the truth. He starts to see that if he follows the
truth he can attain Rama and by itself the world will disappear. The
world does not have to be dropped, it disappears by itself. By the false
Rama is not found, by</p><p>the truth the world is not found. One who sees this will have to make
a clear choice. I call making this choice initiation, I call this choice
sannyas. It is a decisive event.</p><p><br></p><p>ALONENESS THE SIDDHA KNOWS, NEEDING TWO IS SADHU, THE TRUE SEEKER,
NEEDING FOUR-FIVE THE HOUSEHOLDER, TEN-TWENTY THE WORLDLY MAN.</p><p>The siddha, the realized one knows he is alone. And even in a crowd
he is still alone. Understand it this way, even if you are sitting in a
forest you are not alone. You have seen people going, where are they
going? They are going to the mountains, but they take their transistor
radio with them. They get lots of newspapers, buy magazines. Bring the
wife, kids, and friends along – who wants to go alone? They are going to
the mountains taking along a crowd, taking the whole bazaar. And if
sometime they remain alone in the mountains even then they are not
alone. It looks like they are sitting alone, but inside them memories go
on circling of friends, wife, husband, children, family, money, wealth,
shop, bazaar.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you are alone you are in a crowd. The siddha is one who is
alone wherever he is. If he’s in a crowd he is still alone. A siddha
means one who has become acquainted with his inner nature. We have come
alone, we will go alone. We are alone. As we have come, so we are, so we
will go. Our aloneness is eternal. And the play that we have created, of
husband and wife, the ceremonies we have enacted, the families we have
established are all illusion, they are play. They are not any more
valuable that playing with dolls and doll houses. Play, certainly: I am
not saying to stop playing, but remember that play is play.</p><p><br></p><p>ALONENESS THE SIDDHA KNOWS...</p><p><br></p><p>One who experiences aloneness is realized, and is called a siddha.
One who remains alone even in company is called a siddha.</p><p><br></p><p>... NEEDING TWO IS THE SADHU...</p><p><br></p><p>One who needs two, that cannot be alone, that cannot live without ‘I
and thou’ – Gorakh says to consider him a sadhu, a seeker. He is called
sadhu. This is no small thing, to be ready for only two. The mind is not
ready even to accept many. One who has reached the one and accepts his
being is a siddha. Now there is nothing left for him to attain. He has
no more dependence. He has no more reliance on others. One who says at
least one other is needed – whether that one is wife, or husband, or
friend, or master, or disciple; one other is needed – even if that one
is god, as long as the devotee says god is needed he has not been able
to rise above the sadhu. Duality still remains established. You can
establish duality in new directions – duality of husband and wife,
duality of disciple and master, duality of devotee and god, but duality
remains established. You will become a siddha, when you become non-dual.
Now you are a seeker. This is no small thing, that you are ready for
two. There are people here, who are not happy with many.</p><p><br></p><p>A letter of Albert Camus says, even if I have all the women in the
world, still I can’t be satisfied. Because when I see a woman walking on
the street, I feel I want to have her. And what Camus’ letter says is
the state of almost every man. How many will satisfy you? If god were to
stand before you and say, ask, how many will satisfy you? Then you will
be in great difficulty, how many should</p><p>you ask? If you think of a million the mind will say a hundred
million while the opportunity is available. If you think of a hundred
million then a hundred million too will seem small. It seems you should
ask ten billion or a trillion or a billion billion. And still you will
be uneasy, thinking why not take a bigger number, beyond a billion
billion. You will ask for ten billion billion. Who knows what greater
numbers there are! No matter how many you get you cannot be
satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why Gorakh says that one who is a seeker is happy with two.
He is happy with much less. He has come near to one. Now only one more
remains to be dropped. Now only one more to be free of.</p><p><br></p><p>NEEDING FOUR-FIVE THE HOUSEHOLDER...</p><p><br></p><p>And one who is not happy with less than four or five is a
householder. He is living in a family. Consider the meaning of
householder, one who lives in a house is not called a householder – one
who needs many is called a householder. One whose mind still cannot
accept two.</p><p><br></p><p>A friend of mine used to go to the mountains for the hot season. It
happened about ten years ago that he said to me, “You come too.” The
husband and wife both used to go.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Why take me along between the two of you, husband and wife?
Just you two go.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “We wish to take you along because if it is just the two of
us we can never figure out what we want to do. If there is a third we
feel a little easier. If only the two of us are to go then we won’t go.
Two won’t do, at the very least three are needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Notice that at first people are alone, they are restless, they get
married. Then married they begin to feel restless again so they give
birth to children. The number goes on increasing... And it has no end.
And if this is still not enough, go and become a member of the Rotary
Club. If this still is not enough, join the Janata Party. Some crowd or
other... some disturbance...</p><p><br></p><p>... TEN-TWENTY THE WORLDLY MAN.</p><p><br></p><p>And people who are not happy even with ten or twenty, they need a
horde of associates, they need a whole army. They are worldly.</p><p><br></p><p>The siddha is one who is happy with his own existing. The worldly is
one who is not satisfied even with a crowd of thousands, who is always
searching for a crowd. Okay... let’s go see the Kumbha Mela. What will
you do at the Kumbha Mela? Do you want to be pushed and shoved? The
bigger the crowd, the more it grows, because many people enjoy a crowd.
If a crowd is standing somewhere, you will abandon a hundred thousand
jobs and go stand in the crowd. You forget your real work, why you had
gone out. It may be that your wife was sick and you were going to call a
doctor, but the crowd was so much that you felt to have a look at what
is going on. You stood in the crowd, got lost in excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>A crowd has its own magnetic attraction, that pulls people. The
bigger the crowd, the more they get excited, get agitated. This is the
most degenerate state of the mind, the crowd. And one who wants to stay
with the crowd will have to follow it.</p><p>Sannyas is a means of becoming free of the crowd. One must repudiate
the psychology of the crowd. The crowd says, if you remain like us you
can live among us. Wear clothes like the clothes we wear. Have your hair
cut like we have our hair cut. Do everything as we do. Then you can be a
member. Then you can be with us.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd says that if you attempt to show your own individuality
then you can’t be with us. This is why every crowd tries to take away
your individuality, to efface you, to make you a number, a statistic not
a man. This is why no crowd can forgive you if you become a little
unique. Very small things cannot be forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>A gentleman came to me saying, “Since my son has started coming to
listen to you he has let his hair grow.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “How does letting hair grow damage you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” he said, “It doesn’t damage me at all but in our family no one
lets their hair grow like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “It is the hairs fault. If they are left alone, won’t they
grow? What’s the harm in it? He saves a little money. Why are you
bothered by your son’s hair getting long?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was bothered but couldn’t give any clear answer to what was
bothering him, but he was bothered, “... because he is becoming a little
unique, becoming a little distinct from us. This has never happened in
our family. Hair should be cut just like it should be.”</p><p><br></p><p>Who decides how it should be cut? Who is the boss to decide this
matter? I told him, “Do you worship Bhagwan Krishna?”</p><p>He said, “Of course I worship.” “Do you accept him totally?”</p><p>“I accept him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“His hair? If he were born in your family you would call him a
hippie. And if he puts on his peacock crown, then? Think about your son
a little, if he grows his hair, wears yellow clothes of silk, puts on
ornaments etc, picks up a flute, starts setting down rhythms with his
feet and stands with his peacock crown, then what will you do? Will you
worship or not? Will you do puja and worship him – or will you do puja
in the other sense and punish him?”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd cannot forgive the slightest difference. The crowd wants
you to become obedient. Do you know what people do in villages? The
crowd ostracizes you – food and snacks are cut off, tobacco and visiting
are cut off. And a man in the village for whom tobacco and visiting are
cut off – no one offers him a smoke, no one calls him for a meal – that
man is dead, his very living becomes difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>The cities have given man a kind of freedom that never existed in
villages and could never exist there. The village was very enslaving.
Villages have started being eliminated so freedom is increasing in</p><p>the world. A village was a very collective thing. The greatest danger
in the village was that the village could excommunicate you on any
excuse. Any slight thing and you were excommunicated, your life became
hard. Who to live with all the time? Who to talk to? Social intercourse
was shut off. Life was impossible. No one would speak to you or converse
with you. The village is so small that if anyone talks with you social
intercourse will be shut off for him too. Going out, people will avoid
you.</p><p><br></p><p>People praise the village highly, without seeing and understanding.
The village was a great bondage, the village was a total prison. Even
now the village is a prison. Even now there is no freedom in the
village. There cannot be freedom in the village. Freedom is possible
only in a big town where there are enough people that social intercourse
cannot be shut off. If someone shuts you off then other people will be
available that you can sit with, that you can speak with. The village is
so small that control can easily be maintained.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence in a country like India the elimination of untouchability is
impossible as long as villages exist. And the strange thing is that
Mahatma Gandhi and all the people that have followed him think that the
village should remain – and at the same time this they want
untouchability to be eliminated. Untouchability cannot be eliminated in
the village. In the village it is impossible to eliminate
untouchability. There is no way. Untouchables cannot even drink water
from the village well. They cannot even go to the village temple. In the
city it can be eliminated, in the city who can know that an untouchable
has come into the temple? No seal has been marked on the face of an
untouchable.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world the job that Buddha and Mahavira were not able to
accomplish, has been done by small things, like the railway. Buddha and
Mahavira could not do the work that trains have done. An untouchable is
sitting happily at your side. You cannot do anything. He has taken a
ticket too. If you are to do something what will you do? And it is not
certain that he is an untouchable. And it is possible he is wearing more
stylish clothes than you, that you are smoking a ‘bidi’ and he is
smoking a cigarette. What will you do? If you are hungry on the train
you will eat with the untouchable sitting at your side, he will push up
closer, he will shove more. You cannot do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I say unto you that what Buddha and Mahavira could not do the trains
have done. Buddha and Mahavira tried hard to eliminate untouchability,
they couldn’t manage. The poor trains have done it, have accomplished
it. They have brought a revolution. The job that temples could not do,
restaurants have done. The job pilgrimage centers could not do, cinema
halls have done. Life has its own way of moving.</p><p><br></p><p>The city has brought a kind of freedom to man. In the village there
is great trouble. In the village every inch of your behavior is known,
every inch of your character is known. It is a small place. Everyone
knows what everyone else is doing every moment. Each one knows, knows
you through and through, just as you know them through and through. In
the city it is very convenient. If you fall in love with a woman, she
lives in the other side of the city. Your neighbors will not know that
you have fallen in love with a woman. They think that every day you are
going for satsang, that you have become a great devotee, early in the
morning you leave for the temple. In the village this was not possible.
In the village freedom was impossible, the village was bondage. The
crowd was in control.</p><p><br></p><p>The birth of the individual has happened in cities. In villages no
individuals existed, only the crowd existed. The soul is born in one who
rises above the crowd, in him the birth of a soul starts to happen. In
the crowd the soul is not born.</p><p>This is why I say a Hindu has no soul. A Muslim has no soul. He is
part of a crowd. The crowd is suppressed by politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Be an individual. Free yourself from prisons. Drop all
discriminations. And you will find the soul starts shining inside of
you. Start being alone.</p><p><br></p><p>There are difficulties in being alone. But one who passes through
difficulties is cleansed also. GREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED,
CONSIDER THIS WORD OF TRUTH: ONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT,
LIFTS THE LOAD OFF HIS HEAD.</p><p>A lovely statement. Gorakh is saying greatness comes only when you
completely obliterate your greatness.</p><p><br></p><p>GREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED...</p><p><br></p><p>Greatness will arrive in your life when you completely efface and
destroy your ego. When the feeling of I completely disappears. When will
the ‘I’ disappear? When ‘thou’ is no longer needed. As long as you need
the other, I too will remain. I and thou exist together.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that psychologists say the child first
knows the other, then knows I. How can the child see himself at first?
He doesn’t know anything of himself. First he knows the mother. He sees
his mother sometimes comes close, sometimes goes away. Lying there in
the cradle he goes on seeing that when I am hungry, when I cry mother
comes near. When I am not troubled mother goes away. Slowly slowly it
starts becoming clear to him that mother is separate from him. Mother is
the other. As it starts to get clear to him that mother is distinct,
then at the same time slowly slowly like a shadow it starts to become
clear to him, I am distinct also.</p><p><br></p><p>The other arises first, then the I arises. And it disappears in the
same way: first the other disappears, then I disappears. People who want
to get rid of the I first, never get rid of it. So don’t try to get rid
of the ego directly. Drop dependence on the other. Become such that you
have no need of the other, such that you alone are enough – sufficient,
satisfied, contented! Slowly slowly as the other is gone, the I will go
just after it.</p><p><br></p><p>I and thou are two sides of the same coin – on one side is written I,
on the other side thou. It is easy to drop the other, because the other
is other, she is separate. To drop the I is difficult. And in one who
drops the other, the I drops by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>GREATNESS IS WHEN GREATNESS EFFACED...</p><p><br></p><p>... and then greatness comes into your life. This is a rare
statement. One whose ego, whose I; that I am above, I am great, I am
prominent, I am special, I am extraordinary, incomparable – if such
ideas of importance are destroyed, are erased, then importance manifests
inside him. He becomes incomparable. You only think you are
incomparable, you are not. He becomes certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh says think about this truth a little.</p><p>ONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT...</p><p><br></p><p>And one who becomes void of I like this becomes tiny, becomes simple
like a small child in whom the I has not yet been born, the master
himself comes looking for him.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE WHO BECOMES TINY THE MASTER SEEKS OUT, LIFTS THE LOAD OFF HIS
HEAD.</p><p><br></p><p>And naturally if a bundle has been put on the head of a small child
then who will not think of lifting it down? When you become tiny, become
small, become a child, the master appears before you and only then can
the bundle be brought down, only then can compassion shower on you. And
if the bundle comes down, your load comes down – of thoughts, of desires
– then the root is cut!</p><p><br></p><p>Watering leaf by leaf, salting one snack at a time Rahim such
intelligence! Who will call it great?</p><p>You have seen in a village when a woman is making bari snacks she
will never salt them one bari at a time. Salt has to be mixed into the
batter. When a gardener waters he doesn’t water each and every leaf, he
waters the roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Watering leaf by leaf...</p><p><br></p><p>It would be total madness if a gardener watered leaf by leaf.</p><p><br></p><p>... salting one snack at a time</p><p><br></p><p>And if someone separately salted each bari it would be madness. Rahim
such an intelligence! Who will call it great?</p><p>No one will say this is an indication of intelligence. A gardener
gives water to the roots. A woman making baris puts the salt in the
batter. Get to the root. The root of all your illusions is ego. Cut the
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Another statement of Gorakh:</p><p><br></p><p>NATH SAYS, LISTEN O AVADHU, KEEP THE MIND FOREVER STEADY,</p><p><br></p><p>REMOVE THE EGO, SEX, ANGER. YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO ALL SACRED PILGRIM
PLACES.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go on a pilgrimage. There is not need to go anywhere. All
directions become transformation, all become places of transformation.
Just do one thing:</p><p><br></p><p>REMOVE THE EGO, SEX, ANGER...</p><p><br></p><p>And ego is the root. And ego still contains all the leaves – of sex,
of anger, of greed. All the leaves are contained in the ego. Ego is the
root. If this one thing is removed, it this one thing is said
farewell</p><p>to – the I – enough, the moment of life transformation has come. The
great transformation has happened. You have entered from darkness into
light.</p><p><br></p><p>HOPE BRINGS DISTRESS, DOUBT BRINGS SORROW,</p><p><br></p><p>And one who lives preserving hopes, lives holding desires will always
be surrounded by adversities. The more your desire the more your
dejection, because in this world no desire is fulfilled. Desire cannot
be fulfilled. The nature of desire is not to be fulfilled. Desire is
unfulfillable. As Buddha has said, craving is unfulfillable. It cannot
be fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to a Sufi fakir. And he said, “How can my craving be
fulfilled?”</p><p><br></p><p>The fakir said, “Come with me. I am going to the well to get water,
at the same time I can instruct you. When we reach, there will be no
need to speak. You will be able to see it and understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>The enquirer was a little surprised, thinking what kind of
instruction is this that can be given at the well. And is this man in
his senses or not?” This fakir was carefree, very ecstatic. His eyes
were as if he had just drunk wine. They were red. He was in ecstasy. His
feet wobbled as he walked the way a merry drunkard walks. The enquirer
started to feel a little afraid, the matter of the well, if he gives a
shove? If he does something or he himself jumps in and I am caught? But
still he was interested in the answer he will give. Okay let’s go, I
will stand back a little and watch. And what he saw surprised him even
more. He thought, he is completely mad.</p><p><br></p><p>He dropped a bucket in the well that had no bottom in it. The bucket
made a great racket inside the well, made a huge noise and sank in the
water. It didn’t take any time to fill up, because there was no bottom
in it. Then he pulled, but got nothing. The bucket came up empty, then
he threw it again. Two or three times the man watched. He said,
“Brother, are you in your senses? I had come to be instructed by you: it
seems you yourself are in need of instruction. What are you doing? Are
you mad? Will this bucket ever be filled?”</p><p><br></p><p>The fakir said, “You have understood something? I am dropping this
bucket in the well for you. The bucket of craving has no bottom. You go
on filling it your whole life, it will not fill up. No one has ever
filled it. There is no bottom: what can I do, what can you do? This is
why there is sorrow. Then when the bucket... you make so much effort,
reach the well, manage to reach the edge of the well with great
difficulty, because there was a line there, a crowd. With great
difficulty, somehow you get the chance to drop the bucket. You drop the
bucket and it fills up too: when you look into the well you find the
bucket full, you see it submerged in the water. You are in high spirits,
you start pulling. You pull with great expectations and when it reaches
your hand – not a drop in it!</p><p><br></p><p>“How many desires have you had? How many times have you felt that now
I am satisfied? But were you ever? How many times have you felt that now
the bucket far away in the well is full? – by the time it reached your
hand it was empty. Again and again this has happened, but still you
didn’t wake up, still you weren’t startled out of your sleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>HOPE BRINGS DISTRESS, DOUBT BRINGS SORROW</p><p><br></p><p>One who lives in hope this way will always be in affliction.</p><p>... DOUBT BRINGS SORROW</p><p><br></p><p>And there will be nothing but suffering in the life of one who is
doubtful, who has not yet been able to catch hold of the thread of
trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt can never give rise to happiness because doubt is a dilemma, a
wavering, a mind in fragments. In trust the mind becomes collected,
become united, becomes unfragmented. And the very nature of an
unfragmented mind is bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>This double affliction – of hope and of doubt – will not let up,
until some master startles you, awakens you.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>One who does not run away, a master will invite with his light, let
you join his radiance too, he will give you an opportunity to look
inside of him. And you will see a burning light there and a shower of
bliss and a taste of immortality. Then you will understand completely
how it happened – it happened through trust. How it happened – it
happened through becoming free of desire.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was saying, I and thou are two faces of the same coin, in the
same way desire and doubt are two faces of the same coin, in the same
way trust and bliss are two faces of the same coin. These things go
together. But how can you know that trust and bliss are two sides of the
same coin? You can know it sitting near one in whom the happening has
occurred.</p><p><br></p><p>BALANCE HAS BECOME THE ESSENCE OF ALL AUSTERITY AND PENANCE HAS
REDUCED THE CHILDISH CUPID TO ASH,</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD, ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR
STOMACHS.</p><p><br></p><p>The essence of all chanting and austerities, all centering – is
satsang. Without it nothing can happen. Without it no matter what you do
will be the groping of a blind man. It is like a blind man shooting
arrows. He cannot see the arrow, he cannot see the target. Does an arrow
shot in the dark ever hit? And if it should hit it has no value.</p><p><br></p><p>BALANCE HAS BECOME THE ESSENCE OF ALL AUSTERITY AND PENANCE...</p><p><br></p><p>Only through satsang is there an emergence of centering, of sanyam,
which is the essence of all chanting and austerities.</p><p><br></p><p>Consider this word sanyam – it means centering not restraint or
control. The word sanyam has become very distorted in people’s hands.
Ordinarily you call a renunciate a sanyami. This is incorrect. Neither
the worldly nor the renunciate is sanyami: both are asanyami –
uncentered, imbalanced. One is imbalanced in the direction of worldly
enjoyment, the other is imbalanced in the direction of renunciation. The
balanced, the sanyam, lives in the middle. The very meaning of the word
sanyam is in the middle, balanced, even tempered.</p><p>One man is eating too much, he is uncentered. And another man fasts
too much, he too is uncentered. He is uncentered at the other extreme.
But one who eats the right amount of food, eats just as much as is
necessary, neither less nor more – he is sanyami, centered.</p><p><br></p><p>The word sanyam indicates music in one’s life. Sanyam is the music of
life’s veena. The strings should not be too tight, should not be too
loose.</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD...</p><p><br></p><p>If you meet a yogi somewhere who is centered he is worth seeing.
Neither indulgent, nor renunciate. This is a problem with me, with my
sannyasins. I don’t tell them to become renunciates. And for centuries
you have understood that a renunciate is sanyami. This is why you think
I am not teaching my sannyasins sanyam. I am teaching them nothing but
sanyam, centering. I tell them: Move away from indulgence a little,
don’t lean towards renunciation. Indulgence is on the left, renunciation
is on the right. Truth is in between the two, in the exact middle –
majjhim nikaya, the middle path. This is the golden path: living in
between. Live in the world but live such that the world is not in you at
all. Sit in the market and be in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD...</p><p><br></p><p>You should see this. If there is a wonder in the world worth seeing
it is not the Taj Mahal, or the pyramids of Egypt, or the Great Wall of
China – if there is a wonder in the world worth seeing it is a person
who has come to the center, who is in sanyam, because from there arises
a fragrance, a sound, that if you understand it, if it reaches your
nostrils, if it gives your ear its secret, if it pierces your heart –
then you will start to be transformed. A new journey will begin in your
life. ‘Lead me from darkness unto light.’ You will start moving from
darkness towards the light. ‘Lead me from death to immortality.’ You
will start moving from death to the immortal. ‘Lead me from falsehood to
the truth.’ You will start moving from the false to the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But this happening will occur near a sanyami.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE TWO BIG DISEASES WON’T LEAVE WITHOUT A MASTER.…</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK FOR SUCH A YOGI IN THE WORLD, ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR
STOMACHS.</p><p><br></p><p>And the rest of what goes on in the name of yoga, this whole
profession, is just a way of filling the belly, nothing more than that.
You can see your Akhandanandas, Pakhandanandas etc, etc... Their whole
employment is growing a big belly. The bigger the belly the bigger the
yogi – this seems to be the definition. And the one who has defeated
everyone is Nityananda, the guru of Baba Muktananda of Ganeshpuri. Have
you seen his picture? Look at his picture and then read this statement
of Gorakh again:</p><p><br></p><p>... ALL OTHERS JUST FILL THEIR STOMACHS.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have seen many bellies, but Nityananda’s has no equal –
nothing but stomach! Have you seen his picture or not? If you haven’t
seen it then definitely see it. People just go on filling up. And you
call him a sannyasin, call him a mahatma.</p><p>Sanyam is music. Sanyam is a rare art. Sanyam is not a matter of
forcing, sanyam is spontaneity. HOW CAN I SAY O PUNDIT, WHERE GOD
IS?</p><p>IF YOU LOOK FOR OWN SELF, THERE IS NO I, NO THOU.</p><p>O pandits, o scholarly people. How can I explain to you in which
place god is, because god is everywhere. He exists and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>O pandits, how can I explain where god is, where is god not? IF YOU
LOOK FOR OWN SELF, THERE IS</p><p>NO I, NO THOU.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing I can say to you, if you look at yourself then you will not
find any I nor any thou. And the moment there is no more I, no more
thou, what will remain is god. You cannot attain god anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>A statement of Gorakh:</p><p><br></p><p>HIDE SEEING IN YOUR EYES, LISTENING IN THE EARS,</p><p><br></p><p>HIDE BREATHING AT THE NOSE TIP, ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA
REMAINS.</p><p><br></p><p>Hide the flame in your eye, hide the sense of seeing. Don’t look
outside, looking out you get entangled.</p><p><br></p><p>HIDE SEEING IN YOUR EYES...</p><p><br></p><p>Hide the capacity of the eyes to see and close the eyes, so that the
whole energy of seeing becomes collected inside, so you can see
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>... LISTENING IN THE EARS</p><p><br></p><p>And now don’t listen outside the ear. Now be free of what is outside
the ear and listen within.</p><p><br></p><p>... LISTENING IN THE EARS,</p><p><br></p><p>HIDE BREATHING AT THE NOSE TIP...</p><p><br></p><p>It is enough this taking breath from outside. Now search for that
moment when the outer breath stops, becomes peaceful, neither comes nor
goes. Then you will experience a new life inside, you will experience a
new breath.</p><p><br></p><p>... ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS.</p><p>Then nothing remains, then only the state of nirvana remains. This
experience is the experience of god, this experience is liberation, this
is nirvana. These are differences of name.</p><p><br></p><p>ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS. HOW CAN I SAY O PUNDIT, WHERE GOD
IS?</p><p>How can I tell you, O pandits, you are looking in scriptures: you
have gone mad. You are looking on pilgrimages? You are mad. You are
seeking in idols? You are mad. God is not found in such places.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU LOOK FOR OWN SELF... look at yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>... THERE IS NO I, NO THOU. There neither I remain nor you remain, no
I no thou – whatever is left is god.</p><p><br></p><p>... ONLY THE STATE OF NIRVANA REMAINS. A STONE HOUSE OF GOD?</p><p>The idol too is made of stone. A GOD OF STONE?</p><p>The temple is stone, the idol is stone.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH WORSHIPPING STONE?</p><p><br></p><p>And endlessly worshipping stone you think a fountain of love will
spring up in you heart?</p><p><br></p><p>Guard this statement deep in your heart. This calamity has happened
so clearly in this country it is not necessary to prove it. India has
become so stone-hearted, the whole cause is the worship of stones. If
you worship stone you become stone. Worship with a little understanding,
because what you worship becomes the destination of your life. What you
worship becomes an ideal for you. What you worship, you will start to
become like. Think before you worship.</p><p><br></p><p>A STONE HOUSE OF GOD, A GOD OF STONE? HOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH
WORSHIPPING STONE?</p><p><br></p><p>And how will prayer arise within you? How will love be awakened? How
will the lamp of love be born? A stone is your god, your temple is of
stone, you too will become stone. The devotee whose god is stone will
not remain human for long, he will become stone.</p><p><br></p><p>In this country you will see a very miraculous thing. People are
worshipping a lot, they are praying – and they are completely stonelike.
There is no kindness, no compassion, no love. Kindness, compassion and
love are completely gone. No one has anything to do with anyone else. If
someone is dying or living it is no one’s business. And people have
discovered great doctrines: that each one is suffering the fruits of his
own karma, what should we do? – we are on our way to worship in</p><p>the temple. People are suffering the fruits of their own karma. As
you have done so you will suffer. As you have sown so you will reap. If
your house catches fire, sometime you must have set fire to someone
else’s house. Now suffer it, who will put it out? You are dying of
starvation, die, you must have caused someone to starve in a past life,
so now you are suffering the fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>These are tricks. These are the snares of doctrine. And remember,
just as spiders spinning webs to catch flies, won’t sit on their web
proclaiming, “Come, flies and be caught, I will eat you.” Will any flies
be caught then? When a spider spins a web he says to the flies, “Come
flies, drink some tea, have breakfast... Come by sometime, lets get
together. We’ll have satsang, discuss a couple of things.” Then the
flies will be caught. And if they are caught, they are caught.</p><p><br></p><p>Great spider webs of religious doctrine are spread all around you. If
you are caught in them you will writhe in agony, the spiders will suck
you. These spiders have become your religious teachers, pandits,
priests. They have become ones who direct your life, great seers of
life. They are giving you paths, they show you the way – they who don’t
know any path. Those who haven’t had any experience of themselves are
talking about the soul, talking about god. Empty words, false words.
There is no breath in their words, nor is a there a beating heart.</p><p><br></p><p>A STONE HOUSE OF GOD, A GOD OF STONE? HOW WILL LOVE BURST FORTH
WORSHIPPING STONE?</p><p><br></p><p>OFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?</p><p><br></p><p>You see how people pick flowers, living flowers. Flowers have just
blossomed, they were just dancing in the wind. They were just spreading
their fragrance to the sky. They were just having a dialogue with the
rays of the sun. They were so happy, so ecstatic. Then they were picked.
People go out in the morning to pick them. Picked, they are offered in
the temple. Living flowers are murdered, and offered up to a stone? What
was already offered to existence you steal and offer to a stone?</p><p><br></p><p>He is right:</p><p><br></p><p>OFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?</p><p><br></p><p>How insane you are! If you brought stones and offered them to flowers
okay, but don’t destroy flowers. And people say, “No-no, we love flowers
very much, this is why we pick them.”</p><p><br></p><p>A friend wanted to pick a flower and give it to George Bernard Shaw.
They were strolling together in a garden. The friend’s garden, the
flowers... He saw Bernard Shaw standing near the flowers overwhelmed,
absorbed... The friend started to pick. Bernard Shaw said, “Stop! Stop!
Don’t pick them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Don’t you like the flowers?”</p><p><br></p><p>Bernard Shaw said, “I like them very much, they are very lovely.” So
he said, “That’s why I am picking them.”</p><p>He said, “This is too much! If a child is lovely do you break its
neck and make a bouquet? If a flower is lovely how can you pick it? How
are you able to do it? You don’t cut children’s heads to decorate your
bouquets, putting the head of the child on the table, saying look he is
our son, how lovely! So why do you pick flowers?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh is right:</p><p><br></p><p>OFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS?</p><p><br></p><p>I lived in Jabalpur for many years. I used to keep a lovely garden.
Many flowers bloomed there. People started coming in the morning to pick
flowers. They came with tilak and sandalwood paste on their foreheads,
chanting Rama-Rama, Rama-Rama. So I said, “Don’t pick the flowers.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “But we are picking them for worship. Everyone has the
right to pick flowers for worship.” I said, “If you are picking them for
any other reason I can give them, but not for worship.”</p><p>They said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “For worship I absolutely cannot give, because they are
already worshipping. Don’t disturb their worship. They are offered up to
god. Yes, if you have fallen in love with some woman and you want to
offer her a flower, good, take it. At least offer it to the living.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” they said, “We are going to the temple of the goddess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “If you offer them to a living goddess you can pick them, but
they are not for any temple- shlemple.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I had a sign put up, saying, “If you want flowers for anything
except worship, pick them. But for worship it is not allowed.”</p><p><br></p><p>In this garden too, flowers are blooming, they wither just where they
bloom. They have been offered to existence right where they are. Why
pick them?</p><p><br></p><p>OFFERING LIFE TO WORSHIP THE LIFELESS? HOW CAN YOU SWIM THE INFINITE
THROUGH SUCH SINFUL ACTS?</p><p><br></p><p>How to swim across this difficult ocean with these false acts? with
these useless actions? with these unconscious activities?</p><p><br></p><p>BATHING IN TIRTHA AFTER TIRTHA...</p><p><br></p><p>How many pilgrimage places, how many bathing ghats, have you bathed
at?</p><p><br></p><p>... HOW CAN THE INNER BE PENETRATED THROUGH OUTER CLEANSING?</p><p><br></p><p>And you have washed the body outside, how will it penetrate inside?
When will you wash the inside? The inside will be washed at only one
tirtha – when you find a bathing ghat of satsang, of sitting with the
master. Satsang is the only lake where an inner bath happens.</p><p>ADINATH MY GRANDSON, MACHINDRANATH MY SON, GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS
OFFSPRING.</p><p>A very amazing statement. You will be surprised hearing it. He is
saying...</p><p><br></p><p>Adinath is a unique mythical name in India’s history. I say mythical,
not historical, because history doesn’t account for such things. But
Adinath is like the source of the Ganges. The Jainas consider Adinath
their first master, their first tirthankara. Rishabdev and Adinath are
his names. He is the first tirthankara: hence ‘Adi-nath’ – the ‘original
master’, the one who was first, the one who began it. The Jaina
tradition was born from Adinath.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Rig Veda Adinath is mentioned with great respect, an extremely
respectful description. Hence he is given total respect in the Hindu
tradition too. The Hindu tradition has not given any respect to
Mahavira. They have not even mentioned his name. If there were no Jaina
and Buddhist scriptures it would not be known that Mahavira ever
existed. But Adinath has been given great respect. It appears that Jaina
and Hindu traditions became separate later on. At the time of Adinath
they must have been one. No distinction had been made yet. This is why
the description in the Rig Veda indicates respect, great respect. And he
is the first tirthankara of the Jainas. He is the very foundation of
their whole religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantrikas also maintain that Tantra began with Adinath. And Siddha
Yogis also maintain that Adinath is their first guru. Hence Adinath
appears to be the original source. As if all the traditions of this
country emerged and flowed from this one individual.</p><p><br></p><p>But Gorakh’s statement is very shocking. Gorakh says:</p><p><br></p><p>ADINATH MY GRANDSON!</p><p><br></p><p>Adinath is my grandson.</p><p><br></p><p>... MACHINDRANATH MY SON!</p><p><br></p><p>And my guru - his master was Machindranath – is my son.</p><p><br></p><p>... GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS OFFSPRING.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing my sons and daughters, seeing my sons and grandsons I am very
happy.</p><p><br></p><p>As we come closer and closer to the time of Kabir, statements like
this began to be called ulatbansi, reversed flutes. It is a very lovely
statement! Jesus too has a statement like this. Someone asked Jesus: “On
what authority do you speak?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus said, “On what authority? Before Abraham existed, I
am.”</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham has the same place in Jewish, Christian and Islamic
traditions as Adinath has in Jaina, Hindu and Buddhist tradition.
Abraham is the first man of the Jewish tradition. Later Christianity</p><p>emerged from him. Later Islam emerged from him. Jesus’ statement is
very wonderful. Jesus says: “On what authority? Before Abraham I
am.”</p><p><br></p><p>The questioner said, “You are trying to startle me. Are you talking
senses? Thousands of years have passed since Abraham existed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Yes, I know, but I precede him.”</p><p><br></p><p>What could Jesus mean? Jesus is saying that which is at my center of
centers, that which is the life of my life, existed before anything had
happened. When existence had not yet begun, when the sunrise of
existence had not happened, since then I am.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever someone knows it, then everything else is afterwards.
One who has known his own nature has known god, he has known the root of
existence. And the root is certainly before everything. Adinath was
after him, Abraham was after him.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorakh it saying the same. A profound joke, a lovely jest. Gorakh is
saying since I have known myself, since then I have known that
everything else happened after me. Remember ‘me’ does not mean Gorakh.
Me has the same meaning as Krishna means in the Geeta. Drop all religion
Arjuna, and come to my feet. This my feet does not mean come to the feet
of Krishna. I am the one. Who is that ‘I am the one’? Not Krishna. That
one is manifest in Krishna, that one is also manifest in Arjuna. That
one is always being manifested and will always be manifested. That same
has manifested in me, that same has manifested in you. If someone finds
out, he becomes a buddha and if someone does not find out he remains
sleeping. This is the only difference between buddhas and non-buddhas.
There is no other difference. One has awakened, the other is sleeping.
But the one who is sleeping is just as much god as the awakened. There
isn’t a grain of difference. There is no qualitative difference.</p><p><br></p><p>He is revealing this fact:</p><p><br></p><p>ADINATH MY GRANDSON...</p><p><br></p><p>What should I say about myself? Since I have known myself, I have
seen myself, what has happened? Now it appears to me that even Adinath
happened after me.</p><p><br></p><p>ADINATH MY GRANDSON, MACHINDRANATH MY SON...</p><p><br></p><p>And perhaps Adinath you have quite forgotten already, you don’t even
remember him. But Machindranath, who is my master – and who was just
alive – he is my son.</p><p><br></p><p>... GORAKH AVADHUT BEHOLDS HIS OFFSPRING.</p><p><br></p><p>And this whole existence is my own offspring. Seeing this Gorakh
Avadhut is very happy. There is another saying of Gorakh, Narendra had
just asked about it yesterday. That saying is also lovely:</p><p><br></p><p>AVADHU, CALL GOD MY DISCIPLE, CALL MACHHINDRA MY GRANDSON,</p><p><br></p><p>LEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED, COMPASSIONATELY I REVERSE THE
ORDER.</p><p>O Avadhut, Shiva is my chela, my disciple, god himself is my
disciple. O Avadhut, existence is my disciple, Machindranath my
grandson, meaning a disciple of a disciple. I have no need to establish
myself as a master because I am god in person. But from the fear that
the unenlightened people that follow me will not be able to have faith
in a yogi without a guru, I have made Machindranath my guru, while in
reality the order is reverse, because Machindranath himself is my
disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>LEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED...</p><p><br></p><p>So that people with no master don’t start making their own
declarations that they have reached. So that hollow people don’t start
making false declarations, this is the reason.</p><p><br></p><p>LEST GURULESS THE EARTH IS ANNIHILATED...</p><p><br></p><p>So that the whole earth doesn’t go into annihilation.</p><p><br></p><p>... COMPASSIONATELY I REVERSE THE ORDER.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I have made a reversal. I have made my own son my father.
I have made my own disciple my master, so that for unenlightened people
an indication remains, that without a master there is no
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>And whoever becomes enlightened, this is their experience:</p><p><br></p><p>AVADHU, ISHVAR MY CHELA, BHANINJAY AND MACHINDRA MY GRANDSONS,</p><p><br></p><p>Whoever is enlightened becomes the form of the divine. One who has
known himself has become the ultimate. What he knows he becomes. Then
everything else comes after him. He has gone beyond time, he has gone
outside of time and place. He is first, he is last. He is the very
first, he is also the very last. In reality there is just one, not two.
Who is guru and who is chela? Who is bhakta, who is bhagwan? Who is
devotee, who god? Not even this distinction remains, nor should it
remain. Only in this identity is the showering of bliss, the experience
of the immortal.</p><p><br></p><p>But you will have to disappear before this. As you are you are
egotistical, this ego state you will have to say good by to.</p><p><br></p><p>DIE, O YOGI, DIE! DIE, SWEET IS DYING. DIE THAT DEATH GORAKH DIED AND
SAW.</p><p>Enough for today?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

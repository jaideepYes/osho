They are so pregnant with meaning that even a child can understand them, although even the oldest person may not understand them. To understand these anecdotes you have to learn the whole language of Zen. It has a world of its own.\nIt speaks of course in your languages but it gives a totally new color, a totally new meaning to the same old words or gestures. Most often it speaks in gestures. People who are outside the stream of Zen will find it a little eccentric, crazy, but it is utterly sane; just its meaning has to be explained to you. The people who have been studying and meditating in Zen don’t need any explanation; they immediately pick up the gesture. But that is not true about the people outside the Zen circle. This anecdote is a beautiful illustration.\nNANSEN ONCE WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND, SEEING A MONK THERE, THREW A PIECE OF BROKEN TILE AT HIM AND HIT HIM. WHEN THE MONK TURNED HIS HEAD, NANSEN\nLIFTED UP ONE LEG. Now there is something Nansen wants to convey through the gesture, but the monk missed.\nTHE MONK MADE NO RESPONSE. NANSEN RETURNED TO THE TEMPLE AND THE MONK FOLLOWED HIM AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT, SAYING “THE MASTER JUST THREW A PIECE OF TILE AT ME AND HIT ME. DID HE NOT DO THIS AS A MEANS OF AROUSING ME?”\nNANSEN SAID, “HOW ABOUT RAISING THE LEG?” THE MONK WAS SILENT.\nThe gesture is ancient. The monk turned only halfway when he was hit, he turned halfway and looked at the master. That’s why the master raised one leg. He is saying, “Turn totally; halfway will not do. Halfhearted you cannot enter into yourself. Have a complete about-turn.” That was the meaning of raising one leg: “You are doing it, but very halfheartedly.”\nThere are things which can be done halfheartedly. In the whole world whatever we are doing, nothing requires your total being to be involved in it. But as far as the inner pilgrimage is concerned your total being is needed. Nothing has to be left behind. You have to gather your whole consciousness. In that very gathering you are coming closer to the center.\nRight now we are living on the circumference, completely forgetful about the center, yet the center is the source and the center is the goal. At the very center of your being is the connecting link with the universe. There you are not you. At the very center you disappear, there only remains a pure consciousness, a fragrance.\nPeople are afraid to go in, for the simple reason they can feel, unconsciously of course, that they can exist only as personalities on the circumference. If they go deeper into their own being, they will have to leave their personalities, their egos, their respectabilities; all that they have gathered will have to be left. They will have to go alone as consciousness, pure consciousness.\nAnd the ultimate fear of dissolving oneself into the universe... When a river reaches to the ocean, they say that it stops for a moment, thinks twice, looks backward – all those beautiful valleys and the mountains – hesitant, fragile, afraid to take a jump into the ocean, because that jump means you will not be anymore. But that is only half the truth. That jump also means that you will become the ocean.\nI have told you about a great Indian mystic, Kabir. In his youth he wrote a small poem in which he said, “When I reached to my very center I felt as if a dewdrop has slipped from the lotus leaf into\nthe ocean.” It was a beautiful statement. But at the time of his death, he called his son and told him, “Change it please because now I know more. That was my first acquaintance with the ocean. And I had felt at that time that the dewdrop had disappeared in the ocean. Please change it; write down that the ocean has disappeared in the dewdrop. Now I can speak with authority.”\nThe fear is one-sided. You have not taken into account the whole realization.\nNansen hit the monk with the tile. Nansen was the man who started hitting, slapping, beating, just to wake you. We are according to Zen half asleep, half awake. Our waking is not authentic and total. We are almost somnambulists, sleeping, and also working with closed eyes, and if you become more watchful, you will see it in yourself that many of your actions you are doing like a robot; you have done them so many times.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say that man’s mind has the function of a robot. In the beginning you have to learn, you have a little awareness. Once you have learned something, you don’t need any awareness; once you have learned something, it is transferred to the robot part of your mind. Then it becomes computerized; then you can go on sleeping and the mind will go on working.\nNansen’s starting to hit monks is very symbolic; because if somebody is hit for no reason, naturally for a moment he wakes up. For a moment he comes out of his thick crowd of thoughts, because it is so unreasonable. If it had been reasonable it would not have disturbed; the man would have rationalized why Nansen did it.\nBut because he could not rationalize – there was no reason, he has not done anything wrong; he is simply working in the garden, and the master suddenly takes a broken tile and hits him hard – the mind stops for a moment.\nHe turned to look at the master; at that moment the master raised one leg. That he could not understand. The master is saying, “You have turned only half; turn totally, and turn in, not towards me. I’m just an object outside.”\nNo authentic master wants his disciples to turn towards him, because that is taking them away from their own selves. Only the false master, the pseudo master, tries to get people to look up to him, to surrender to him, to be dedicated to him, to be devoted to him; his whole concern is that the disciples’ consciousness should be arrowed towards him.\nThis is the only way of finding out whether the master is authentic or pseudo. The authentic master tries in every possible way to turn you inwards. Everything outside is objective: it will never give you an insight into your subjective reality; it will never allow you to know your interiority, which is your temple, where is hiding your buddha, where you will reach to the highest point of consciousness.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK CAME AND STOOD BEFORE NANSEN WITH FOLDED HANDS. NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT LAYMAN!”\nA layman is not a disciple but has deep gratefulness, respectfulness towards those who have arrived, who have reached to the point of ultimate explosion. Folded hands in the East are the symbol of respectfulness. It also represents humbleness.\nNANSEN SAID, “A GREAT LAYMAN!” THE MONK CLASPED HIS HANDS. NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT MONK!”\nOn the surface all these statements look irrational, absurd. What the monk is saying by clasping his hands is, “My hands are not dead, they are not like a statue. My love and my gratitude is alive. You should not call me just a layman, I am a fellow traveler.” The movement of the hands signifies that the hands are not made of stone or wood, they are alive.\nAnd Zen is the religion of the people who worship only life, no stone gods, no statues, no God in the heaven. All those are fictions for Zen. Zen loves this life in total affirmation. For Zen there is nothing more to existence than this life; you just have to go deeper into it, where space and time are both left behind, where you enter into the transcendental. Zen has no god, Zen has no prayer; there is nobody to whom to pray. Zen is absolutely concerned with the inner, not with the outer.\nAll of the religions are concerned with the outer: a god somewhere above the clouds. Zen laughs at such gods. Man has created them out of fear: man needs a protection, he feels alone, he feels afraid of death, he needs a protector god. All the gods are fictions; but they have a certain utility: they console. Zen does not believe in consolation, it believes in realization.\nAnd if you want to know what life is... from the outside you can only know the surface. Only digging deep into your own being will you be able to know life from within and the moment you know life from within your whole existence becomes a dance, a joy, a bliss, a gratitude to existence. Zen has a totally different approach to any other religion. As far as I’m concerned, Zen is the only religion, others are pseudo substitutes.\nNansen has thousands of disciples. One of the disciples, Sekiso, wrote a small poem: A VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT\nBUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL. WILD AND SOLITARY,\nSHARP AND FULL OF POWER,\nIT SOARS LIKE A BIRD’S FEATHER. I GIVE MY ASSENT ONLY TO ONE\nWHO HAS CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT. WALKING, SITTING, LYING DOWN, HE DOES EVERYTHING AS THOUGH\nHE WERE OUT FOR A STROLL.\nA beautiful piece, describing exactly the state of a man who has reached to the sunlit peaks of consciousness. Everything for him is just playfulness, as if he has gone for a walk in the morning, as the sun is rising; just a morning walk: no goal, he can turn anywhere, he’s not going anywhere, no purpose, just the sheer joy of the morning and the cool breeze, and the rising sun, and the singing birds, and the opening flowers, and the fragrant air. But no purpose of his own, no goal of his own, just a sheer joy.\nUnfortunate are the people who never look to the sunrise, to the sunset, to a starry night. These are all non-utilitarian things, and such people are so much concerned with money, power. Their whole concern is with small and mediocre things.\nIn Zen, nature in all its forms: whether it is raining, or there is a thundercloud, or lightning, whether it is morning, or evening, or a deep night when everything becomes silent... Zen goes on watching all this, witnessing all this. For the man who has found the witness, this whole existence becomes an immense wonder.\nSekiso said, A VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT, against the witness, BUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL; the witness has never moved. It is the only immovable part in the world. Everything moves and changes; only one thing never changes, that which is hidden inside you at the center.\nHeraclitus said, “You cannot step twice in the same river.” But unfortunately in the West, philosophers, theologians, the so-called religious people have never inquired about the witness. If I meet Heraclitus somewhere – and one never knows, in this vast universe I may meet him – I would like to tell him, “It is true you cannot step twice in the same river because the river is continuously moving. But you have forgotten one thing, you have forgotten yourself.”\nThe same witness can step in thousands of rivers. The changing rivers don’t change the witness. A mirror can reflect thousands of things; those reflections don’t change the mirror. Reflections come and go without leaving a trace behind, no footprints, just the mirror. And this mirror has been the search of the East. When I say ‘witness’, I mean a mirror-like quality of your consciousness, which simply reflects.\nA VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT BUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL.\nWILD AND SOLITARY,\nSHARP AND FULL OF POWER,\nIT SOARS LIKE A BIRD’S FEATHER. I GIVE MY ASSENT ONLY TO ONE\nWHO HAS CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT.\nWALKING, SITTING, LYING DOWN, HE DOES EVERYTHING AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT FOR A STROLL.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE POEMS OR HAIKUS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT EACH EVENING SOUND SO CONTEMPORARY – AS THOUGH THEY WERE WRITTEN ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DISCIPLES. YET THEY HAVE COME TO US FROM CENTURIES EARLIER.\nIS THAT AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE TRUTH, THAT IT RESONATES WITH ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, IN ANY AGE, WHO ARE SEEKING IT?\nManeesha, every art can be described either as objective art or as subjective art. Subjective art you will find everywhere; it comes from your feelings, from your heart, from your mind in paintings, in poetry, in music.\nBut objective art comes from the emptiness of your heart; you just become a flute, a hollow bamboo and the universe sings through you. Your only credit is that you don’t create any hindrances, you simply allow the universe to flow through you. With you being in a let-go and allowing the universe to flow through you, objective art is created.\nThere is not much objective art in the world, because before objective art can be created you have to become a hollow bamboo; and you are so solid, your ego is so stubborn. Before creating objective art, you have to be so humble, almost nobody. In your absence there comes a great universal flood. That flood can become poetry, a painting, music, a dance, a sculpture. Thousands of dimensions are available, you just allow it. These haikus are objective art; they are not composed, they have flown through a silent, empty heart.\nI have told you about the great English poet Coleridge. When he died he left forty thousand poems incomplete. His whole life his friends insisted to him, “Why don’t you complete them? Just one line is missing, otherwise this will be a great poem.”\nHe said “You don’t understand me. I don’t write, I don’t compose, I am in the hands of the universe. When it comes, it comes. When it stops, it stops. I have no way of adding anything or editing out anything.”\nA strange incident happened when Rabindranath Tagore was given the Nobel Prize. He was given the Nobel Prize for a small book of poems, GITANJALI, ‘Offering of Songs’. Originally the book was written in Bengali which was his mother tongue; then he translated it into English. But he was hesitant because it might not be so beautiful as in his own mother tongue.\nSo he asked a great missionary who was here in India, Andrews, “Will you take a look and if you find anything grammatical, linguistic that is wrong in it, just please help me so I can change it ?”\nAndrews was a very learned missionary. He looked through the poem and he was very much impressed. But at four points he said, “If you change these four words, it will be as complete as it can be.” Rabindranath changed those four words.\nRabindranath’s friend, a great poet himself, Yeats, called a poets’ gathering in which Rabindranath was to recite GITANJALI for the first time in London. Everybody was impressed. It is a tremendously beautiful book; there exist only a few books in world literature which can be compared to it.\nBut Yeats himself looked a little concerned. He said to Rabindranath, “Everything looks right; only, at four words something has gone wrong.”\nAnd those were the four words that Andrews had put in. Yeats got those four words exactly and told him that, “There the flow seems to be stopped, somebody else has entered in, knowledgeable... perhaps your own words may not have been grammatical. That does not matter, that is the freedom of the poet to open his heart, not to bother about grammar and not to bother about rules of language. You just put your words.”\nAnd Rabindranath changed his words in place of Andrews’, and Yeats said ,“Now I feel the flow is complete, there are no stumbling blocks.”\nThat was also Yeats’ own experience, that whenever a poem descends from beyond, and you are only at the receiving end, if you try to improve upon it, it loses its mystery, its miracle. It becomes human; it loses its quality of being divine.\nManeesha, haikus don’t belong to time. No objective art belongs to time; it is forever, because it comes from beyond the mind, from eternity itself. That’s why you feel as if these haikus are written for you. These incidents have happened for you. This will be forever so; as long as man goes on searching for inner truth these haikus will remain contemporary, these anecdotes will not become out-of-date.\nBefore you go for your morning stroll... just to let you know that you have to come back... I’m already condemned all over the world – just be kind to me – because I go on forcing you to go in, to go in. And if you really go in, you are gone! So as far as I’m concerned I will tell you to go slowly, and remember to return. I’m sending you with a return ticket!\nIt is the nurse’s day off, so Doctor Bones sticks his head into the waiting room and says, “Who’s next?”\n“Me, doc,” says Kowalski, standing up. “What is your trouble?” asks Bones.\n“I’ve got a pain in my prick,” replies Kowalski.\nBones grabs Kowalski by the arm and drags him into his office.\n“Never do that again!” he cries. “Especially when my waiting room is full of people. Next time, just say that your nose or your eye is troubling you!”\nA couple of weeks later, Kowalski comes back. It is the nurse’s day off again, so Bones sticks his head out of his surgery, and asks, “Who’s next?”\n“Me, doc,” says Kowalski, standing up. “What’s the trouble?” inquires Bones.\n“My nose is bothering me, doc,” replies Kowalski. “What’s wrong with it?” asks Bones.\n“Well, doc,” says Kowalski, “I can’t piss out of it!”\nThis joke always reminds me about a shankaracharya who was speaking in Bombay. A lady was sitting in the front, very rich, with a small child. And the child was continuously telling her, “I want to piss! I wanna piss!” And the shankaracharya was very much annoyed because he was talking about great things. And everybody was laughing and suppressing their laughter, but the boy was very insistent: “You allow me, otherwise I will piss here! It is coming so strong!”\nFinally the shankaracharya had to end his sermon more quickly. He took the lady aside, and told her, “You have to teach some culture to the child. He disturbed the whole spiritual sermon.”\nThe woman asked, “What can I do? He always insists on coming with me. And he cannot sit for too long. So this question of, ‘I wanna piss!’ always comes.”\nThe shankaracharya said, “You should tell him that whenever you feel that you want to piss, don’t use the word ‘piss’. Just say, ‘Mom, I want to sing.’ And then you can take him away to the bathroom; nobody will know what ‘singing’ is.”\nA few months later the shankaracharya was staying in that lady’s house itself. And just by coincidence the lady said to the shankaracharya, “Some relative has died. I and my husband have to go immediately and we may not be back by the morning. And the child is accustomed to sleep with me or with his father. So if you don’t mind, can he sleep with you?”\nThe shankaracharya said, “There is no problem, he can sleep with me.”\nBut in the middle of the night the problem came. The child nudged the shankaracharya and said, “I wanna sing!”\nThe shankaracharya said, “You idiot, in the middle of the night, you wanna sing?! You disturb my sleep and you will disturb other people’s sleep. Just keep quiet and go to sleep!”\nBut after a few minutes the boy nudged the shankaracharya again, and he said, “I’m trying my best, but the singing is coming very fast!”\nThe shankaracharya said, “I have never seen a singing that is coming so fast that you cannot wait for the morning.”\nHe said, “My God, till the morning! I cannot wait for even one minute! Just tell me, can I sing or not?!”\nThe shankaracharya thought for a moment. There was nobody else to inquire what to do, so he said, “You do one thing. You sing very silently into my ear, so nobody is disturbed. Then be satisfied!”\nThe boy said, “If you say so I will do it! But don’t say anything about it to anybody! Not to my mother, not to my father. Otherwise, I will get beaten!”\nHe said, “Why will you get beaten? Are you simply singing or doing something else?” He said “Pure singing!”\nSo the shankaracharya gave him his ear, and the boy “sang” in his ear! The shankaracharya jumped up! He said, “You idiot! This is singing?!”\nHe said “You have forgotten. It was you who suggested to my mother that instead of ‘I wanna piss’, I should say ‘I wanna sing’. And now you are changing.”\nThen the shankaracharya remembered, and he said, “My God, I will never change anybody’s word again.”\nChanging words is dangerous!\nA group of American tourists are about to enter the Limerick Hotel in Ireland, when suddenly the revolving door spins around and out shoots Old O’Grady.\nO’Grady takes off, racing around the car park of the hotel making a noise like a car engine. He runs around changing gears, honking the horn, making hand signals, and then goes roaring off down the street.\nOne of the American tourists drops his camera and turns to Seamus, who is leaning against the side of the hotel.\n“What was that all about?” asks the tourist.\n“Oh,” replies Seamus, “that was Old O’Grady. He is a little eccentric, and he always ‘drives’ around like that when he has had a few drinks.”\n“Well,” snorts the tourist, “why don’t you try to stop him?”\n“Now why should I want to do that,” asks Seamus, “when he pays me five dollars every week to wash the car?!”\nLittle Alice is walking down the beach one day when she sees Chester Cheese lying on the sand with only a newspaper covering his machinery.\nLittle Alice looks at the snoozing Chester for a while, with great curiosity. Finally, unable to resist, she shakes Chester awake and says, “Hey, mister. What is that thing moving underneath your newspaper?”\nChester, groggy and blinking his eyes, looks at Little Alice and mumbles, “Oh, that is my pet bird.” Chester falls back asleep while Alice stands there and watches the mysterious, moving newspaper.\nFinally, she cannot wait any longer, so she goes up to Chester and peeks under the newspaper. The next thing Chester knows, he wakes up in hospital with his machinery in bandages, and in terrible pain.\n“What happened?” he moans to the nurse.\n“Perhaps,” replies the nurse, “you should ask this little girl. She came in with you.” Chester looks at Little Alice. “So?” he asks. “What happened?”\n“Well,” says Alice firmly. “I decided to take a look at your pet bird, but as soon as I lifted up the newspaper and started to play with him, he jumped up and spat at me.\nSo I grabbed him, twisted his neck, crushed his eggs, and stomped on his nest!” Now Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes, and feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow, look inwards. Gather all your consciousness as a spear. Move towards the center of your being. At the center are all the secrets of life. The center is beyond birth and beyond death.\nMetaphorically we call the center the buddha, the awakened one. At this moment, you are all buddhas. And remember, to be a buddha does not mean to be a Buddhist.\nIt is not a question of following anyone. It is not a question of conversion. It is a question of awakening to your own depths, to your own center.\nYour ordinary life is lived on the circumference. Meditation means to move from the circumference to the center. And this center is not only yours. It is the center of the whole universe.\nWe are separate on the circumference; at the center we are one, one oceanic reality. This oneness brings tremendous blessing, a great silence, a deep blissfulness.\nDeeper and deeper. The deeper you go, the closer you are to the universal center. Without any fear go on, till you feel the buddha arising in you.\nOne has not to become a buddha; the buddha is our very nature. We are born with it. We are carrying it within our very soul. Everybody is pregnant with a buddha. It is only a question of discovering, only a question of remembering, who you are.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax. Just watch the body lying there, the mind lying there. You are not the body nor the mind but just a witness, a mirror-like, reflective watchfulness. This witnessing is the greatest contribution the East has made to the world. Everything dies, everything changes, only this witnessing remains.\nThousands of flowers, thousands of colors, stars are showering on you.\nThe evening was beautiful in itself. But ten thousand buddhas have made it majestic, a splendor, a miracle.\nParticularly in these days, to reach to your own center has become very difficult because nobody tells you, nobody educates you, that your real treasure is within you not without you. The god is not above the clouds, the god is hidden in your consciousness. Your consciousness is god itself.\nDrink from this source as much as you can, get drenched with the joy and the fragrance because you have to bring it back.\nMeditation is not something that you do for a few minutes, it is something that you have to continue the whole day. Doing everything, your buddhahood should remain an undercurrent, a deep awareness, alertness, consciousness in your gestures, in your actions, in your silences.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back.

PIECE OF BROKEN TILE AT HIM AND HIT HIM. WHEN THE MONK TURNED HIS HEAD,
NANSEN LIFTED UP ONE LEG. THE MONK MADE NO RESPONSE. NANSEN RETURNED TO
THE TEMPLE AND THE MONK FOLLOWED HIM AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT, SAYING “THE
MASTER JUST THREW A PIECE OF TILE AT ME AND HIT ME. DID HE NOT DO THIS
AS A MEANS OF AROUSING ME?”</p><p><br></p><p>NANSEN SAID, “HOW ABOUT RAISING THE LEG?” THE MONK WAS SILENT.</p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK CAME AND STOOD BEFORE NANSEN WITH FOLDED
HANDS. NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT LAYMAN!”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK CLASPED HIS HANDS. NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT MONK!”</p><p>Maneesha, there exists in world literature nothing comparable to Zen
anecdotes. They are so pregnant with meaning that even a child can
understand them, although even the oldest person may not understand
them. To understand these anecdotes you have to learn the whole language
of Zen. It has a world of its own.</p><p>It speaks of course in your languages but it gives a totally new
color, a totally new meaning to the same old words or gestures. Most
often it speaks in gestures. People who are outside the stream of Zen
will find it a little eccentric, crazy, but it is utterly sane; just its
meaning has to be explained to you. The people who have been studying
and meditating in Zen don’t need any explanation; they immediately pick
up the gesture. But that is not true about the people outside the Zen
circle. This anecdote is a beautiful illustration.</p><p><br></p><p>NANSEN ONCE WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND, SEEING A MONK THERE, THREW A
PIECE OF BROKEN TILE AT HIM AND HIT HIM. WHEN THE MONK TURNED HIS HEAD,
NANSEN</p><p>LIFTED UP ONE LEG. Now there is something Nansen wants to convey
through the gesture, but the monk missed.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK MADE NO RESPONSE. NANSEN RETURNED TO THE TEMPLE AND THE MONK
FOLLOWED HIM AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT, SAYING “THE MASTER JUST THREW A
PIECE OF TILE AT ME AND HIT ME. DID HE NOT DO THIS AS A MEANS OF
AROUSING ME?”</p><p><br></p><p>NANSEN SAID, “HOW ABOUT RAISING THE LEG?” THE MONK WAS SILENT.</p><p>The gesture is ancient. The monk turned only halfway when he was hit,
he turned halfway and looked at the master. That’s why the master raised
one leg. He is saying, “Turn totally; halfway will not do. Halfhearted
you cannot enter into yourself. Have a complete about-turn.” That was
the meaning of raising one leg: “You are doing it, but very
halfheartedly.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are things which can be done halfheartedly. In the whole world
whatever we are doing, nothing requires your total being to be involved
in it. But as far as the inner pilgrimage is concerned your total being
is needed. Nothing has to be left behind. You have to gather your whole
consciousness. In that very gathering you are coming closer to the
center.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now we are living on the circumference, completely forgetful
about the center, yet the center is the source and the center is the
goal. At the very center of your being is the connecting link with the
universe. There you are not you. At the very center you disappear, there
only remains a pure consciousness, a fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>People are afraid to go in, for the simple reason they can feel,
unconsciously of course, that they can exist only as personalities on
the circumference. If they go deeper into their own being, they will
have to leave their personalities, their egos, their respectabilities;
all that they have gathered will have to be left. They will have to go
alone as consciousness, pure consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And the ultimate fear of dissolving oneself into the universe... When
a river reaches to the ocean, they say that it stops for a moment,
thinks twice, looks backward – all those beautiful valleys and the
mountains – hesitant, fragile, afraid to take a jump into the ocean,
because that jump means you will not be anymore. But that is only half
the truth. That jump also means that you will become the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about a great Indian mystic, Kabir. In his youth he
wrote a small poem in which he said, “When I reached to my very center I
felt as if a dewdrop has slipped from the lotus leaf into</p><p>the ocean.” It was a beautiful statement. But at the time of his
death, he called his son and told him, “Change it please because now I
know more. That was my first acquaintance with the ocean. And I had felt
at that time that the dewdrop had disappeared in the ocean. Please
change it; write down that the ocean has disappeared in the dewdrop. Now
I can speak with authority.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fear is one-sided. You have not taken into account the whole
realization.</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen hit the monk with the tile. Nansen was the man who started
hitting, slapping, beating, just to wake you. We are according to Zen
half asleep, half awake. Our waking is not authentic and total. We are
almost somnambulists, sleeping, and also working with closed eyes, and
if you become more watchful, you will see it in yourself that many of
your actions you are doing like a robot; you have done them so many
times.</p><p><br></p><p>George Gurdjieff used to say that man’s mind has the function of a
robot. In the beginning you have to learn, you have a little awareness.
Once you have learned something, you don’t need any awareness; once you
have learned something, it is transferred to the robot part of your
mind. Then it becomes computerized; then you can go on sleeping and the
mind will go on working.</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen’s starting to hit monks is very symbolic; because if somebody
is hit for no reason, naturally for a moment he wakes up. For a moment
he comes out of his thick crowd of thoughts, because it is so
unreasonable. If it had been reasonable it would not have disturbed; the
man would have rationalized why Nansen did it.</p><p><br></p><p>But because he could not rationalize – there was no reason, he has
not done anything wrong; he is simply working in the garden, and the
master suddenly takes a broken tile and hits him hard – the mind stops
for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned to look at the master; at that moment the master raised one
leg. That he could not understand. The master is saying, “You have
turned only half; turn totally, and turn in, not towards me. I’m just an
object outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>No authentic master wants his disciples to turn towards him, because
that is taking them away from their own selves. Only the false master,
the pseudo master, tries to get people to look up to him, to surrender
to him, to be dedicated to him, to be devoted to him; his whole concern
is that the disciples’ consciousness should be arrowed towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only way of finding out whether the master is authentic
or pseudo. The authentic master tries in every possible way to turn you
inwards. Everything outside is objective: it will never give you an
insight into your subjective reality; it will never allow you to know
your interiority, which is your temple, where is hiding your buddha,
where you will reach to the highest point of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK CAME AND STOOD BEFORE NANSEN WITH FOLDED
HANDS. NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT LAYMAN!”</p><p><br></p><p>A layman is not a disciple but has deep gratefulness, respectfulness
towards those who have arrived, who have reached to the point of
ultimate explosion. Folded hands in the East are the symbol of
respectfulness. It also represents humbleness.</p><p>NANSEN SAID, “A GREAT LAYMAN!” THE MONK CLASPED HIS HANDS. NANSEN
SAID, “A GREAT MONK!”</p><p>On the surface all these statements look irrational, absurd. What the
monk is saying by clasping his hands is, “My hands are not dead, they
are not like a statue. My love and my gratitude is alive. You should not
call me just a layman, I am a fellow traveler.” The movement of the
hands signifies that the hands are not made of stone or wood, they are
alive.</p><p><br></p><p>And Zen is the religion of the people who worship only life, no stone
gods, no statues, no God in the heaven. All those are fictions for Zen.
Zen loves this life in total affirmation. For Zen there is nothing more
to existence than this life; you just have to go deeper into it, where
space and time are both left behind, where you enter into the
transcendental. Zen has no god, Zen has no prayer; there is nobody to
whom to pray. Zen is absolutely concerned with the inner, not with the
outer.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the religions are concerned with the outer: a god somewhere
above the clouds. Zen laughs at such gods. Man has created them out of
fear: man needs a protection, he feels alone, he feels afraid of death,
he needs a protector god. All the gods are fictions; but they have a
certain utility: they console. Zen does not believe in consolation, it
believes in realization.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you want to know what life is... from the outside you can only
know the surface. Only digging deep into your own being will you be able
to know life from within and the moment you know life from within your
whole existence becomes a dance, a joy, a bliss, a gratitude to
existence. Zen has a totally different approach to any other religion.
As far as I’m concerned, Zen is the only religion, others are pseudo
substitutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen has thousands of disciples. One of the disciples, Sekiso,
wrote a small poem: A VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT</p><p>BUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL. WILD AND SOLITARY,</p><p>SHARP AND FULL OF POWER,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SOARS LIKE A BIRD’S FEATHER. I GIVE MY ASSENT ONLY TO ONE</p><p>WHO HAS CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT. WALKING, SITTING, LYING DOWN, HE DOES
EVERYTHING AS THOUGH</p><p>HE WERE OUT FOR A STROLL.</p><p><br></p><p>A beautiful piece, describing exactly the state of a man who has
reached to the sunlit peaks of consciousness. Everything for him is just
playfulness, as if he has gone for a walk in the morning, as the sun is
rising; just a morning walk: no goal, he can turn anywhere, he’s not
going anywhere, no purpose, just the sheer joy of the morning and the
cool breeze, and the rising sun, and the singing birds, and the opening
flowers, and the fragrant air. But no purpose of his own, no goal of his
own, just a sheer joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunate are the people who never look to the sunrise, to the
sunset, to a starry night. These are all non-utilitarian things, and
such people are so much concerned with money, power. Their whole concern
is with small and mediocre things.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen, nature in all its forms: whether it is raining, or there is a
thundercloud, or lightning, whether it is morning, or evening, or a deep
night when everything becomes silent... Zen goes on watching all this,
witnessing all this. For the man who has found the witness, this whole
existence becomes an immense wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>Sekiso said, A VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT, against the witness,
BUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL; the witness has never moved. It is the only
immovable part in the world. Everything moves and changes; only one
thing never changes, that which is hidden inside you at the center.</p><p><br></p><p>Heraclitus said, “You cannot step twice in the same river.” But
unfortunately in the West, philosophers, theologians, the so-called
religious people have never inquired about the witness. If I meet
Heraclitus somewhere – and one never knows, in this vast universe I may
meet him – I would like to tell him, “It is true you cannot step twice
in the same river because the river is continuously moving. But you have
forgotten one thing, you have forgotten yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The same witness can step in thousands of rivers. The changing rivers
don’t change the witness. A mirror can reflect thousands of things;
those reflections don’t change the mirror. Reflections come and go
without leaving a trace behind, no footprints, just the mirror. And this
mirror has been the search of the East. When I say ‘witness’, I mean a
mirror-like quality of your consciousness, which simply reflects.</p><p><br></p><p>A VIOLENT STORM BEATS AGAINST IT BUT IT NEVER MOVES AT ALL.</p><p>WILD AND SOLITARY,</p><p><br></p><p>SHARP AND FULL OF POWER,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SOARS LIKE A BIRD’S FEATHER. I GIVE MY ASSENT ONLY TO ONE</p><p>WHO HAS CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT.</p><p>WALKING, SITTING, LYING DOWN, HE DOES EVERYTHING AS THOUGH HE WERE
OUT FOR A STROLL.</p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE POEMS OR HAIKUS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT EACH EVENING SOUND SO
CONTEMPORARY – AS THOUGH THEY WERE WRITTEN ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DISCIPLES.
YET THEY HAVE COME TO US FROM CENTURIES EARLIER.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THAT AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE TRUTH, THAT IT RESONATES WITH ALL PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE, IN ANY AGE, WHO ARE SEEKING IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, every art can be described either as objective art or as
subjective art. Subjective art you will find everywhere; it comes from
your feelings, from your heart, from your mind in paintings, in poetry,
in music.</p><p><br></p><p>But objective art comes from the emptiness of your heart; you just
become a flute, a hollow bamboo and the universe sings through you. Your
only credit is that you don’t create any hindrances, you simply allow
the universe to flow through you. With you being in a let-go and
allowing the universe to flow through you, objective art is created.</p><p><br></p><p>There is not much objective art in the world, because before
objective art can be created you have to become a hollow bamboo; and you
are so solid, your ego is so stubborn. Before creating objective art,
you have to be so humble, almost nobody. In your absence there comes a
great universal flood. That flood can become poetry, a painting, music,
a dance, a sculpture. Thousands of dimensions are available, you just
allow it. These haikus are objective art; they are not composed, they
have flown through a silent, empty heart.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about the great English poet Coleridge. When he died
he left forty thousand poems incomplete. His whole life his friends
insisted to him, “Why don’t you complete them? Just one line is missing,
otherwise this will be a great poem.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said “You don’t understand me. I don’t write, I don’t compose, I
am in the hands of the universe. When it comes, it comes. When it stops,
it stops. I have no way of adding anything or editing out anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>A strange incident happened when Rabindranath Tagore was given the
Nobel Prize. He was given the Nobel Prize for a small book of poems,
GITANJALI, ‘Offering of Songs’. Originally the book was written in
Bengali which was his mother tongue; then he translated it into English.
But he was hesitant because it might not be so beautiful as in his own
mother tongue.</p><p>So he asked a great missionary who was here in India, Andrews, “Will
you take a look and if you find anything grammatical, linguistic that is
wrong in it, just please help me so I can change it ?”</p><p><br></p><p>Andrews was a very learned missionary. He looked through the poem and
he was very much impressed. But at four points he said, “If you change
these four words, it will be as complete as it can be.” Rabindranath
changed those four words.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath’s friend, a great poet himself, Yeats, called a poets’
gathering in which Rabindranath was to recite GITANJALI for the first
time in London. Everybody was impressed. It is a tremendously beautiful
book; there exist only a few books in world literature which can be
compared to it.</p><p><br></p><p>But Yeats himself looked a little concerned. He said to Rabindranath,
“Everything looks right; only, at four words something has gone
wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>And those were the four words that Andrews had put in. Yeats got
those four words exactly and told him that, “There the flow seems to be
stopped, somebody else has entered in, knowledgeable... perhaps your own
words may not have been grammatical. That does not matter, that is the
freedom of the poet to open his heart, not to bother about grammar and
not to bother about rules of language. You just put your words.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Rabindranath changed his words in place of Andrews’, and Yeats
said ,“Now I feel the flow is complete, there are no stumbling
blocks.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was also Yeats’ own experience, that whenever a poem descends
from beyond, and you are only at the receiving end, if you try to
improve upon it, it loses its mystery, its miracle. It becomes human; it
loses its quality of being divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, haikus don’t belong to time. No objective art belongs to
time; it is forever, because it comes from beyond the mind, from
eternity itself. That’s why you feel as if these haikus are written for
you. These incidents have happened for you. This will be forever so; as
long as man goes on searching for inner truth these haikus will remain
contemporary, these anecdotes will not become out-of-date.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you go for your morning stroll... just to let you know that
you have to come back... I’m already condemned all over the world – just
be kind to me – because I go on forcing you to go in, to go in. And if
you really go in, you are gone! So as far as I’m concerned I will tell
you to go slowly, and remember to return. I’m sending you with a return
ticket!</p><p><br></p><p>It is the nurse’s day off, so Doctor Bones sticks his head into the
waiting room and says, “Who’s next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me, doc,” says Kowalski, standing up. “What is your trouble?” asks
Bones.</p><p>“I’ve got a pain in my prick,” replies Kowalski.</p><p><br></p><p>Bones grabs Kowalski by the arm and drags him into his office.</p><p>“Never do that again!” he cries. “Especially when my waiting room is
full of people. Next time, just say that your nose or your eye is
troubling you!”</p><p><br></p><p>A couple of weeks later, Kowalski comes back. It is the nurse’s day
off again, so Bones sticks his head out of his surgery, and asks, “Who’s
next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me, doc,” says Kowalski, standing up. “What’s the trouble?” inquires
Bones.</p><p>“My nose is bothering me, doc,” replies Kowalski. “What’s wrong with
it?” asks Bones.</p><p>“Well, doc,” says Kowalski, “I can’t piss out of it!”</p><p><br></p><p>This joke always reminds me about a shankaracharya who was speaking
in Bombay. A lady was sitting in the front, very rich, with a small
child. And the child was continuously telling her, “I want to piss! I
wanna piss!” And the shankaracharya was very much annoyed because he was
talking about great things. And everybody was laughing and suppressing
their laughter, but the boy was very insistent: “You allow me, otherwise
I will piss here! It is coming so strong!”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the shankaracharya had to end his sermon more quickly. He
took the lady aside, and told her, “You have to teach some culture to
the child. He disturbed the whole spiritual sermon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman asked, “What can I do? He always insists on coming with me.
And he cannot sit for too long. So this question of, ‘I wanna piss!’
always comes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The shankaracharya said, “You should tell him that whenever you feel
that you want to piss, don’t use the word ‘piss’. Just say, ‘Mom, I want
to sing.’ And then you can take him away to the bathroom; nobody will
know what ‘singing’ is.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few months later the shankaracharya was staying in that lady’s
house itself. And just by coincidence the lady said to the
shankaracharya, “Some relative has died. I and my husband have to go
immediately and we may not be back by the morning. And the child is
accustomed to sleep with me or with his father. So if you don’t mind,
can he sleep with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The shankaracharya said, “There is no problem, he can sleep with
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>But in the middle of the night the problem came. The child nudged the
shankaracharya and said, “I wanna sing!”</p><p><br></p><p>The shankaracharya said, “You idiot, in the middle of the night, you
wanna sing?! You disturb my sleep and you will disturb other people’s
sleep. Just keep quiet and go to sleep!”</p><p><br></p><p>But after a few minutes the boy nudged the shankaracharya again, and
he said, “I’m trying my best, but the singing is coming very fast!”</p><p>The shankaracharya said, “I have never seen a singing that is coming
so fast that you cannot wait for the morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, till the morning! I cannot wait for even one
minute! Just tell me, can I sing or not?!”</p><p><br></p><p>The shankaracharya thought for a moment. There was nobody else to
inquire what to do, so he said, “You do one thing. You sing very
silently into my ear, so nobody is disturbed. Then be satisfied!”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “If you say so I will do it! But don’t say anything
about it to anybody! Not to my mother, not to my father. Otherwise, I
will get beaten!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Why will you get beaten? Are you simply singing or doing
something else?” He said “Pure singing!”</p><p>So the shankaracharya gave him his ear, and the boy “sang” in his
ear! The shankaracharya jumped up! He said, “You idiot! This is
singing?!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said “You have forgotten. It was you who suggested to my mother
that instead of ‘I wanna piss’, I should say ‘I wanna sing’. And now you
are changing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the shankaracharya remembered, and he said, “My God, I will
never change anybody’s word again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Changing words is dangerous!</p><p><br></p><p>A group of American tourists are about to enter the Limerick Hotel in
Ireland, when suddenly the revolving door spins around and out shoots
Old O’Grady.</p><p><br></p><p>O’Grady takes off, racing around the car park of the hotel making a
noise like a car engine. He runs around changing gears, honking the
horn, making hand signals, and then goes roaring off down the
street.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the American tourists drops his camera and turns to Seamus,
who is leaning against the side of the hotel.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was that all about?” asks the tourist.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh,” replies Seamus, “that was Old O’Grady. He is a little
eccentric, and he always ‘drives’ around like that when he has had a few
drinks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” snorts the tourist, “why don’t you try to stop him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now why should I want to do that,” asks Seamus, “when he pays me
five dollars every week to wash the car?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Little Alice is walking down the beach one day when she sees Chester
Cheese lying on the sand with only a newspaper covering his
machinery.</p><p>Little Alice looks at the snoozing Chester for a while, with great
curiosity. Finally, unable to resist, she shakes Chester awake and says,
“Hey, mister. What is that thing moving underneath your newspaper?”</p><p><br></p><p>Chester, groggy and blinking his eyes, looks at Little Alice and
mumbles, “Oh, that is my pet bird.” Chester falls back asleep while
Alice stands there and watches the mysterious, moving newspaper.</p><p>Finally, she cannot wait any longer, so she goes up to Chester and
peeks under the newspaper. The next thing Chester knows, he wakes up in
hospital with his machinery in bandages, and in terrible pain.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” he moans to the nurse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Perhaps,” replies the nurse, “you should ask this little girl. She
came in with you.” Chester looks at Little Alice. “So?” he asks. “What
happened?”</p><p>“Well,” says Alice firmly. “I decided to take a look at your pet
bird, but as soon as I lifted up the newspaper and started to play with
him, he jumped up and spat at me.</p><p><br></p><p>So I grabbed him, twisted his neck, crushed his eggs, and stomped on
his nest!” Now Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes, and feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, look inwards. Gather all your consciousness as a spear. Move
towards the center of your being. At the center are all the secrets of
life. The center is beyond birth and beyond death.</p><p><br></p><p>Metaphorically we call the center the buddha, the awakened one. At
this moment, you are all buddhas. And remember, to be a buddha does not
mean to be a Buddhist.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of following anyone. It is not a question of
conversion. It is a question of awakening to your own depths, to your
own center.</p><p><br></p><p>Your ordinary life is lived on the circumference. Meditation means to
move from the circumference to the center. And this center is not only
yours. It is the center of the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>We are separate on the circumference; at the center we are one, one
oceanic reality. This oneness brings tremendous blessing, a great
silence, a deep blissfulness.</p><p>Deeper and deeper. The deeper you go, the closer you are to the
universal center. Without any fear go on, till you feel the buddha
arising in you.</p><p><br></p><p>One has not to become a buddha; the buddha is our very nature. We are
born with it. We are carrying it within our very soul. Everybody is
pregnant with a buddha. It is only a question of discovering, only a
question of remembering, who you are.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax. Just watch the body lying there, the mind lying there. You are
not the body nor the mind but just a witness, a mirror-like, reflective
watchfulness. This witnessing is the greatest contribution the East has
made to the world. Everything dies, everything changes, only this
witnessing remains.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of flowers, thousands of colors, stars are showering on
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The evening was beautiful in itself. But ten thousand buddhas have
made it majestic, a splendor, a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Particularly in these days, to reach to your own center has become
very difficult because nobody tells you, nobody educates you, that your
real treasure is within you not without you. The god is not above the
clouds, the god is hidden in your consciousness. Your consciousness is
god itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Drink from this source as much as you can, get drenched with the joy
and the fragrance because you have to bring it back.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is not something that you do for a few minutes, it is
something that you have to continue the whole day. Doing everything,
your buddhahood should remain an undercurrent, a deep awareness,
alertness, consciousness in your gestures, in your actions, in your
silences.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back. But show the quality, even in coming back, of a graceful
buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, peacefully, joyously, with a dancing heart sit down for a few
moments, just to recollect the place you have been, the path you have
trodden. You have to go on this path every day deeper and deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to become acquainted with your buddha as much as possible,
so you can bring him from the center to the circumference.</p><p><br></p><p>When all your actions and all your gestures, words and silences
become that of a buddha, you have arrived home.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

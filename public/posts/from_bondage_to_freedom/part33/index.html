You know what sympathy means, you also know what apathy means; but empathy you do not know.\nSympathy and apathy are opposed to each other. Empathy is beyond both. To help you understand it, let me tell you an incident in Ramakrishna’s life.\nHe was in a boat, going to the other shore of the Ganges near Calcutta. And just out of nowhere – he was surrounded by his disciples – he started screaming, “Don’t beat me!” Tears started flowing from his eyes, and one could see that his body was getting distorted as if somebody was beating him badly. The disciples could see nobody there, but he was in immense torture.\nWhen they reached to the other shore, they found a fisherman with a big crowd surrounding him. He had been beaten by a few people. And the strangest thing was that the same bruises and scratches that had come up on his back, had come up on Ramakrishna’s back too – exactly the same.\nIt was a very mysterious phenomenon. They asked Ramakrishna what it was. He said, “This is empathy. You feel so one with the other that your separate identities lose their boundaries. The\nother’s thirst becomes your thirst, the other’s hunger becomes your hunger, the other’s joy becomes your joy. The other is no longer other: some secret passage has opened between two beings, a deep connectedness.”\nMan has forgotten about empathy completely, but he knows about sympathy. Sympathy is not something great. When somebody is in misery you sympathize; but if you look inside you will find you are feeling great because you are not in misery, somebody else is. At least in this situation you are superior. You can sympathize – you can afford it.\nApathy is your everyday experience. You pass people as if they don’t exist. The servant comes in your room – you don’t wave at him, you don’t smile at him. You don’t even take any note that somebody has come in the room. You remain exactly the same as you were before – no recognition of the other’s existence. This is your everyday experience.\nSympathy once in a while – when somebody goes bankrupt, when somebody’s house is burned, the whole neighborhood is sympathetic. And these are the same people who were jealous of his beautiful house. How can it be? The same people who were jealous of his beautiful house suddenly have become so sympathetic because his house is burned. It is a mask; underneath they are feeling great joy, this was the day they were waiting for. His beautiful house was continuously a torture for their heart. Now, sympathizing with the man, they are in a higher position. They are really feeling good.\nSo remember perfectly well, whenever you sympathize with somebody – watch the inner workings of your mind; it is not friendly. It is not out of your goodness, out of your compassion, but just the opposite. It is your hate, your jealousy, your violence – but now there is no need to show it, the man is finished on his own. Now you can have this beautiful experience and a good night’s sleep by sympathizing with him, by being a real Catholic. Sympathy is not a great quality. It is phony.\nApathy is inhuman. And remember, when you are apathetic towards anybody, your heart is becoming harder. You are not doing any harm to the person, you are simply being self-destructive. The more apathetic you are, the more your heart will lose its great qualities. It will become just a pumping mechanism for breathing, but not a bridge for feeling.\nEmpathy has almost disappeared from human beings. It is certainly the only quality that joins you with the life current within other human beings, animals, trees – with the whole existence. It is pure religiousness. But no religion teaches empathy. All religions teach is sympathy, and sympathy is not the real thing.\nBut in animals and in trees, empathy is still pure, alive. There have been experiments on animals.… A child of some animal is taken deep into the ocean. The mother is on the shore, miles away; but when they start torturing the child, the mother starts feeling the same – the way Ramakrishna did. When they stop torturing the child, the mother stops being tortured. There is some connection between the mother and the child, which, even miles away, remains – some invisible connection.\nThe child has been in the mother’s womb for nine months. He is nothing but an extension of the mother. Whatever he has is the gift of his mother; his blood, his bones, his flesh, his very life is ninety-nine percent from the mother, only one percent from the father.\nThe father does not feel empathy, but the mother feels it. The experiments have been done thousands of miles away, and still it has affected the mother. The father remains unaffected. The father is really not a relative; he has performed just an arbitrary function. Any syringe could have done it – but syringes don’t feel empathy. The father is an unnatural institution.\nThe mother’s situation is totally different. The child is her own extension. Every small thing that has happened in the nine months when the child was in the mother’s womb has affected the child, even the dreams of the mother. If she was sad, the child was sad, because he was just part of her. If she was happy, the child was happy.\nIf you see this whole world so sad, so unhappy, so miserable, one of the reasons is that mothers are not aware when they are pregnant that they are carrying a tremendous responsibility: they are going to create a new being. Now it is not only a question of themselves, somebody else is growing within them; and they should be alert not to get into fights, into anger, into hatred, into jealousies. They should listen to great music, they should read great poetry. They should see nature and its beauty.\nAt least for nine months they should be as silent and meditative as possible. This will change two lives! The child will come in the world with a rejoicing heart; and nine months of silence and meditativeness, music and poetry, is certainly going to change the mother too. It is going to be mutual. She will be grateful to the child her whole life, the child will be grateful to her – and this link continues, there is no way to cut it.\nBut this is a natural phenomenon. In animals it has not been disturbed, but in man it has been utterly disturbed. Even in trees it exists. It has been found... now there are scientific experiments available: there are certain mechanisms like cardiograms which can be attached to a tree, and the cardiograms start making the graph of how the tree is feeling right now. An early morning sun, a beautiful breeze, the whole night’s rest, birds singing – it is paradise; and there is a tremendous harmony in the cardiogram, the graph is harmonious.\nThen you tell the gardener to come with an axe to cut one of the branches of the tree. The gardener comes with the axe – and he is far away, but the graph starts going berserk, it loses its harmony. The branch has not been cut yet; cutting it is only in the mind of the gardener, but even with the mind of the gardener the tree has a certain relatedness.\nThe scientist runs to the gardener and says, “There is no need to cut the tree, but still come with the axe.”\nNow the mind of the gardener is changed; he is not to cut the branch, just to bring the axe. Everything on the outside is the same, but the graph immediately comes back to its harmony.\nAnd the most surprising thing is – this is quite mysterious – this sensitivity of the tree is far more than that of human beings. Even thoughts are affecting it. It is so receptive that even small waves of thoughts passing by it are caught in its net of sensitivity.\nBut even more surprising is, when they have attached the instruments to another tree, they were surprised to know that when the gardener was instructed to go and cut a branch of the first tree, even a second tree, which was not going to be cut, lost its harmony. That means it is not only\nsensitive to the gardener’s mind, it is also sensitive to the neighboring tree. Its neighboring tree is going to be cut – that hurts it. And when the gardener was stopped, the chaotic pattern of the graph disappeared from both trees. They were in tune and in harmony.\nMan thinks he has evolved. In certain ways, yes, but in certain other ways he has lost much. His evolution is only of reason, intellect, but he has lost, on the way, his heart. And the heart is the most significant thing. A thousand and one rationalities cannot give you that which a single heart full of sensitivity can give you.\nEmpathy is relating to people through the heart. But this is possible only if the mind is silent, if there are no thoughts in the mind and it gives way, opens the door to the heart. But ordinarily you are so full of thoughts there is no way to be sensitive.\nEven when you love someone, you say, “I think I have fallen in love.” That too, is a thought: you think. Your love is also dependent on your thinking. You cannot do anything directly from the heart. Your mind has been trained, educated, conditioned in every possible way and your heart has been ignored in every possible way. By and by, you have forgotten that the heart is far more valuable than the mind. Your mind has become everything.\nThe heart is not a Christian, is not a Hindu, is not a Mohammedan, is not a communist – but the mind is. Different ideologies make the mind different. The mind is American, the mind is Russian, the mind is Indian, the mind is Chinese. But the heart? Have you ever thought about the heart? Is the heart also American, Indian, Russian? The heart knows no boundaries, but it has been put into a state of nonfunctioning.\nYour whole energy has been diverted by the educational system, by religious teaching, by political ideologies. It has been forced to go directly to the head and bypass the heart. Slowly slowly you start living without the heart. And to live without the heart is not to live at all.\nThe head is only a mechanism, a biocomputer. And soon there will be better computers than the greatest genius’ head. It is already not of much use. A mathematical problem that Albert Einstein could solve in three or four days’ arduous work can be solved by the computer in a single second. Soon you will see that the head is being replaced by the computer.\nThat’s how things change in the world. Machines replace human beings because they function better. They don’t go on strike, they don’t make unions, they don’t demand more wages. They simply go on working day in, day out; they don’t even need rest. And they produce a thousand times more than man can. Naturally, man is being replaced everywhere by machines, technology.\nThe day is not very far away when you will be paid if you are ready to remain unemployed. If you insist on employment you will not be paid. You can’t have both the things together, employment and pay. If you remain unemployed you can be paid.\nNaturally, people cannot live only with employment, they need the necessities of life; they will choose to remain unemployed and receive the pay. But the implications are very great. When millions of people are unemployed, have nothing to do, there is bound to be more crime, more rapes, more divorces, more thefts, more murders, more suicides.\nMan cannot just sit – unless he happens to be a sannyasin. Either people will have to learn to sit silently, doing nothing, and let the grass grow by itself, or they will be a constant nuisance to each other.\nMind is already finished. Man has to evolve a new system of education which directs his energies towards the heart. Machines cannot have hearts, the computers cannot have hearts. The computers cannot fall in love with each other, nor can they elope with somebody’s wife.\nThe heart knows something which the mind is not aware of. It knows the way of empathy. The heart can connect itself to the whole existence. And that will bring it great ecstasies, immense joy – as if constantly flowers go on showering on you from nowhere.\nYour question is significant, but I don’t think you understand what you have asked; empathy is not your experience. Once in a while lovers, great lovers, have felt it. Once in a while great disciples and masters have felt it.\nGautam Buddha had a disciple, Ananda, who remained with him till his very last breath – almost forty-two years without a single break, day in, day out, twenty-four hours a day. His relationship with Gautam Buddha was not of the mind. The relationship between the master and the disciple has not to be of the mind. If it is of the mind, then it is the relationship between teacher and student. If it is of the heart, then it is the relationship of master and disciple.\nSlowly slowly their hearts came closer, became almost one. It is said that before Buddha asked for water, Ananda was ready. Before Buddha said that he was feeling cold, Ananda was already bringing the blanket. A very underground way had opened – no need to say anything.\nMany times Buddha would say, “Ananda, why have you brought this water? I had not asked you.”\nAnanda said, “It does not matter whether you ask or not, I felt the thirst, that my master is thirsty; I felt my master is cold. I don’t know how, because it is not a question of my mind. Just the feeling – and so strong a feeling that I cannot go against it. If you are not thirsty, don’t drink.”\nBuddha laughed and he said, “No. I was just inquiring how you managed to know it. I was feeling thirsty, I was just going to say. I was feeling cold, and I was just going to say – but you don’t allow me even to say a thing!” Even in the night – if Gautam Buddha was not able to sleep because there were mosquitoes, Ananda could not sleep either. The moment Buddha awoke in the morning – exactly, simultaneously, immediately, Ananda awoke.\nWith lovers it has happened that before your beloved says something you know it. It is already heard by you, although it has not been said.\nSo only in very rare cases is empathy still alive. But it has been a great loss to humanity. It is because of the loss of empathy that we have become unspiritual beings. It has to be regained. Getting it back will give you a totally new, luminous existence. And then you will not feel as an island apart from everybody else, but just part of an infinite continent. And just to feel it is so relaxing, to feel that you are one with the trees, and one with the rivers, and one with the stars. Then for the first time you will know what beauty is, what bliss is, what life is. All that you have to do is to behead yourself.\nMeditation is nothing but a subtle way of beheading! Your head remains in its place, but loses all its content, becomes hollow. When the head is empty, the heart is full. When the head is full, the heart is empty, because you have only that much energy. You can’t have both. Up to now, humanity has chosen the head. And you can see the consequence: the whole earth has become a madhouse.\nMy sannyasins have to change the whole direction of their life force towards the heart. And then you will see a new intensity, a new totality – something that was so close and yet of which you were unaware.\nEmpathy is an experience of the heart. Yes, it is the life current, it is life itself. Question 2\nBELOVED MASTER,\nFOR CENTURIES THE BRITISH BOBBY, WITH NO GUN, ONLY A SMALL TRUNCHEON, HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF THE RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN A CIVILIZED COUNTRY. NOW RIOTERS ARE ATTACKING THE POLICE WITH SHOTGUNS AND GAS BOMBS. IN THE LATEST RIOT TWO HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED AND ONE KILLED WITH A HATCHET. A SENIOR OFFICER SAID, “THIS IS NOT ENGLAND, THIS IS MADNESS. THEY ARE USING MY MEN FOR TARGET PRACTICE.”\nWHAT IS CAUSING THIS SURGE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER? COULD IT HAPPEN IN AMERICA?\nIt is going to happen everywhere. But before we discuss it, a few of your misconceptions have to be completely dropped.\nYou say England was a very cultured societyEngland has been the greatest empire in the world,\nit has exploited millions of people as barbariously as possible. And you call England a cultured, a civilized country? It looked civilized, because all its barbariousness was being expressed all around the earth in the British empire. All ugly people were sent – in the armies, in the civil services, as governors, as governor-generals – outside England. And the empire was vast. It was said the sun never sets on the British empire and it was true. Somewhere or other the sun was still there in the British empire.\nSo it had a very simple way of sending the barbarious elements to the empire, to torture people, to kill people, and to bring all the riches from the whole world to England. Naturally, when all the riches were available to England, there was no need for riots, no need to fight. England had the best universities – Oxford, Cambridge and others.\nEngland has done so many ugly acts that you will not be able to believe it. India – which was the biggest part of England’s empire – was one of the ancientmost countries on the earth. It had its own developed craftsmen, arts. For example, they used to make such thin cloth in Dacca, in Bengal, that you could cover a whole elephant with the cloth and still you could pass the whole cloth through a small finger ring, it was so thin. Thousands of years of craftsmanshipEven if you had seven layers\nof it on your body, you would still be seen as naked. Millions of people were involved in creating that\nkind of cloth. The Britishers were in a difficulty. They cut the hands of millions of craftsmen so that they could sell Manchester cloth in India – and you call England a civilized, cultured country?\nIn one place in Punjab, there is a public park, Jalianwala Bagh. It has only one entrance. They were having a peaceful meeting – almost one hundred thousand men, women and children inside the park, which has eight-foot-tall walls all around, and just a single small gate. A British general fixed a machine gun on the gate and ordered the people to vacate the park within ten minutes. Now, that was impossible; it was a walled garden, people could not get out of it, and the gate was already closed, with the machine gun fixed. The name of the general was Dyer. And after ten minutes he started shooting absolutely innocent people, who had not done anything. Within minutes there were only corpses of children, women, men – one hundred thousand. It was such a blatant, cruel act. What punishment did General Dyer get? Only one punishment: he was sent back to England. You kill one hundred thousand people for no reason, and this is a cultured and civilized country?\nPeople in England were rich, not because they had produced the riches, but because they had exploited the whole empire. They squeezed the last drop of blood from countries like India. Of course, England was happy – at the cost of millions of people dying in poverty. You have taken all their gold, silver, their diamonds, their mines. You have taken everything from them.\nAnd England is a small country, not big enough even to be compared to a state in India. India consists of thirty states now – British India was even bigger, because now Pakistan is separate, Bangladesh is separate. But even now India is thirty times bigger than England.\nEngland was a parasite. Of course, the British behaved well, they were very cultured; they were ladies and they were gentlemen. And what were they doing around the world? They never considered other human beings equal to them. All other human beings, whom they were exploiting and on whose blood they were living, were treated like animals.\nAll these riches pouring in from all over the world made England really beautiful, rich, educated, cultured. But now the empire has disappeared. Now England is going down the drain. And now all those people whom England has trained to kill and murder are turning upon their own people. Every action has its reaction. You cannot escape from the basic laws of life. England will have to suffer.\nYou are asking me: Why is it that there were no riots in England before, and now hundreds of people are being killed, policemen are being killed?\nThere will be more riots, because England has become accustomed to all the riches which are no longer coming. It has become accustomed to having all the luxuries without producing them. Now from where can it get all those riches? Now it is the darkest and the most dismal country on the earth. But that’s how existence functions. If you do something wrong, you are bound to suffer. If you do something right, existence is very rewarding.\nEngland has done so much wrong in the past three hundred years that it seems difficult for it even to survive. All that glory and glamor was borrowed, stolen; forcibly, violently taken away from others. Now that glory is gone; those beautiful days have become dreams. People are unemployed. England is becoming every day poorer and poorer. And the people have become accustomed to being violent, violent with others, in the past; now they will be violent with themselves, with their own. It is absolutely natural, and absolutely justified.\nIt is going to happen to all those countries which have been living on exploitation, whose culture depends on somebody else’s blood. It is bound to happen. It is simply the law of life. You cannot go on against the law for long. Sooner or later it takes you over.\nNow England is just a pauper country. And there is no way to create the empire again, those days are gone. England will suffer much violence in the future from its own people. It has done that violence to other people; the ghosts of all those people will follow it.\nEngland has no future. Darkness and more darknessAnd all that old nonsense of being cultured\nand civilized is already disappearing; the barbarious reality is showing its face. This is going to happen almost everywhere, for different reasons.\nFor example, in India only ten families have half the income and money of the whole country. Ten families have money equal to that of eight hundred million people! How long can you manage such a state? Eight hundred million people are going, sooner or later, to destroy these families. The money belongs to them, they have produced it – and they are dying, their children don’t have milk, their parents don’t have medicine. It is going to happen everywhere. Reasons may be different, but everywhere violence is going to erupt like volcanoes.\nYou are asking me: Can this happen in America too? If it cannot, it should. It is a strange country. The people to whom the land belongs have been forced to live in reservations – the Red Indians – and the people who are ruling the country and have become the owners of the country are all foreigners.\nThis is the only country where the people of the land don’t bother at all about freedom, don’t think at all that they have been enslaved, that their beautiful country has been taken away by foreigners. And the foreigners have some nerve!\nWe have been here for four years. I came with a legal visa, I am here legally. It is up to them to decide, and they are such chickens they cannot decide either yes or no. They don’t want to say yes. They are afraid – and rightly afraid, because I can prove very dangerous! They cannot say no, because the moment they say no, the whole file moves from their hands, and I go to the court.\nAnd it is not only a question of my green card; I will make it a question of freedom for the native Americans. I will ask the Supreme Court, “If you have any sense of justice, if you have any respect for your Constitution, then no foreigner can be in the government. Red Indians should form the government. And all the foreigners should apply for citizenship. If their forefathers committed a sin, forget all about it; they are gone and there is no way to punish them. But they have left generations behind which are answerable. And if the Red Indians want you to be here, you can be here; otherwise, just get back to your own countries.”\nAnd if Red Indians are in the government, the possibility of a third world war simply disappears, because Red Indians will not be at all interested, or even ready for a third world war. They will not pile up nuclear weapons – they cannot create them.\nAnd all the foreigners who call themselves Americans have taken it for granted that this is their country. Sheer bullshit! They can ask for refuge, they can ask the Red Indians to be allowed to live here – but they cannot live here as masters. Enough is enough.\nThere is an old prophecy of the Red Indians – they have informed me, and I said perhaps it is right – that somebody from the East will come and deliver them from their slavery. Perhaps I have come!\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nWHAT IS THE EGO? IT SEEMS A COMPLEMENTARY QUESTION TO “WHO AM I?” AND AS MUCH A KOAN.\nThe ego is just the opposite of your real self. The ego is not you. The ego is the deception created by the society so that you can continue playing with the toy and never ask about the real thing. That’s why my insistence that unless you drop the ego, you will never come to know yourself.\nWhen you were born you had your authentic self. Then they started creating a false self: you are Christian, you are Catholic, you are white, you are German and you are the chosen race of God, you are supposed to rule over the world, and so on and so forth. They create a false idea who you are. They give you a name and around the name they create ambitions, conditionings.\nAnd by and by – because it takes almost one-third of your life – they work on your ego through the school, through the church, college, university.… By the time you come back home from the university you have forgotten completely your innocent being. You are now a very big ego with a gold medal, first class, topping the university. Now you are ready to go into the world.\nThis ego has all the desires, ambitions, wants to be always on the top of everything. You are exploited by this ego. And this never allows you even a glimpse of your real authentic self, and your life is there, in your authenticity. Hence, this ego only produces misery, suffering, fighting, frustration, madness, suicide, murder – all kinds of crime.\nA seeker of truth has to begin from this very point: that whatever you have been told by the society you are, discard it. Certainly you are not it, because nobody can know who you are except yourself – neither your parents, nor your teachers, nor your priests. Except yourself, nobody can enter into the privacy of your being. So nobody knows about you; whatever they have said about you is all wrong.\nPut it aside. Dismantle the whole ego! In destroying the ego, you will discover your being. And that discovery is the greatest discovery possible, because it starts a totally new pilgrimage towards ultimate bliss, towards eternal life.\nYou can choose: either frustration, suffering, misery – then go on holding the ego, nourishing it. Or peace, silence, bliss – but then you have to recover your innocence.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED MASTER,\nIS SYNCHRONICITY THE VERY LAW OF LIFE?\nIt is exactly the same as empathy. It is a scientific name for empathy – synchronicity. There is no difference between the two.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED MASTER,\nCAN YOU SORT OUT THE BIG PEAS, THE SMALL PEAS, AND THE MIDDLE PEAS?\nIt is a difficult problem. First I have to tell you the story from which the question has arisen.\nIn the second world war, one of the German professors of philosophy was recruited into the army. He was not willing, but you know, Germany is Germany: willing or not willing.… From higher up orders were that everybody had to be recruited, the whole of Germany had to become a military camp; only then can you conquer the world.\nThe poor philosopher said many times, “I am of no use,” but nobody listened to him. The first day, early in the morning, he was to learn marching, and the colonel ordered, “Left turn,” but he remained standing still. Everybody else turned left.\nThe colonel knew that he was a philosopher, was bound to be a crank. He could not even turn left. But the colonel thought, “I will see him later on.” Then he went on saying, “Turn right... backward... forward...” and the philosopher just remained standing in his place, as he was. Finally, the line came back to its old position. The colonel asked the professor, “Why didn’t you follow the orders?”\nThe professor said, “What is the point? If all these people, after all these left turns and right turns and backwards and forwards, have to come to the same place where I am already standing, I don’t see the point. And as far as I am concerned, I cannot do anything unless I have a reason to do it. You simply said, ‘Left turn.’ I thought it over. I could not find any reason why – why should I turn left? In the whole world there is no reason for me to turn left, or right, or go back, or come forward. This is all stupid!”\nThe colonel reported to the higher authorities, and they said, “What to do with this man?... because he cannot be trained if he asks about everything, ‘Why?’” In the army you are not supposed to ask why.\nThe general knew about the professor; he was a famous man. He said, “Don’t torture that poor man. Put him in the mess and give him some small work.”\nSo he was put in the mess, and given some small work. He was given a pile of peas and told, “You have to sort it out: small peas on one side, big peas on the other side.”\nAfter one and a half hours, the officer came back. The professor was sitting exactly as he left him, and the peas were also sitting exactly as he had left them. The officer asked, “What is the matter? Can’t you do even that?”\nThe professor said, “It is such a philosophical matter. I have been pondering over it for one and a half hours. It is good – big peas on this side, small peas on this side. But what about the middle ones? And unless I am clear about everything, I don’t take a single step!”\nAnd you are asking me how much time it will take for me to sort out big peas from small peas. I don’t think I can manage it, for the simple reason that I have to go to pee right now!\nOkay?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5512","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_bondage_to_freedom/part33/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_bondage_to_freedom/>From Bondage to Freedom</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">33 Dismantle the ego</h1><div class=post-meta>26 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5512 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Bondage_to_Freedom/part33.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND EVERY RELATEDNESS, AND VICE VERSA?</p><p><br></p><p>The experience of empathy is very rare. You know what sympathy means,
you also know what apathy means; but empathy you do not know.</p><p><br></p><p>Sympathy and apathy are opposed to each other. Empathy is beyond
both. To help you understand it, let me tell you an incident in
Ramakrishna’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>He was in a boat, going to the other shore of the Ganges near
Calcutta. And just out of nowhere – he was surrounded by his disciples –
he started screaming, “Don’t beat me!” Tears started flowing from his
eyes, and one could see that his body was getting distorted as if
somebody was beating him badly. The disciples could see nobody there,
but he was in immense torture.</p><p><br></p><p>When they reached to the other shore, they found a fisherman with a
big crowd surrounding him. He had been beaten by a few people. And the
strangest thing was that the same bruises and scratches that had come up
on his back, had come up on Ramakrishna’s back too – exactly the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very mysterious phenomenon. They asked Ramakrishna what it
was. He said, “This is empathy. You feel so one with the other that your
separate identities lose their boundaries. The</p><p>other’s thirst becomes your thirst, the other’s hunger becomes your
hunger, the other’s joy becomes your joy. The other is no longer other:
some secret passage has opened between two beings, a deep
connectedness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man has forgotten about empathy completely, but he knows about
sympathy. Sympathy is not something great. When somebody is in misery
you sympathize; but if you look inside you will find you are feeling
great because you are not in misery, somebody else is. At least in this
situation you are superior. You can sympathize – you can afford it.</p><p><br></p><p>Apathy is your everyday experience. You pass people as if they don’t
exist. The servant comes in your room – you don’t wave at him, you don’t
smile at him. You don’t even take any note that somebody has come in the
room. You remain exactly the same as you were before – no recognition of
the other’s existence. This is your everyday experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Sympathy once in a while – when somebody goes bankrupt, when
somebody’s house is burned, the whole neighborhood is sympathetic. And
these are the same people who were jealous of his beautiful house. How
can it be? The same people who were jealous of his beautiful house
suddenly have become so sympathetic because his house is burned. It is a
mask; underneath they are feeling great joy, this was the day they were
waiting for. His beautiful house was continuously a torture for their
heart. Now, sympathizing with the man, they are in a higher position.
They are really feeling good.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember perfectly well, whenever you sympathize with somebody –
watch the inner workings of your mind; it is not friendly. It is not out
of your goodness, out of your compassion, but just the opposite. It is
your hate, your jealousy, your violence – but now there is no need to
show it, the man is finished on his own. Now you can have this beautiful
experience and a good night’s sleep by sympathizing with him, by being a
real Catholic. Sympathy is not a great quality. It is phony.</p><p><br></p><p>Apathy is inhuman. And remember, when you are apathetic towards
anybody, your heart is becoming harder. You are not doing any harm to
the person, you are simply being self-destructive. The more apathetic
you are, the more your heart will lose its great qualities. It will
become just a pumping mechanism for breathing, but not a bridge for
feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Empathy has almost disappeared from human beings. It is certainly the
only quality that joins you with the life current within other human
beings, animals, trees – with the whole existence. It is pure
religiousness. But no religion teaches empathy. All religions teach is
sympathy, and sympathy is not the real thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But in animals and in trees, empathy is still pure, alive. There have
been experiments on animals.… A child of some animal is taken deep into
the ocean. The mother is on the shore, miles away; but when they start
torturing the child, the mother starts feeling the same – the way
Ramakrishna did. When they stop torturing the child, the mother stops
being tortured. There is some connection between the mother and the
child, which, even miles away, remains – some invisible connection.</p><p><br></p><p>The child has been in the mother’s womb for nine months. He is
nothing but an extension of the mother. Whatever he has is the gift of
his mother; his blood, his bones, his flesh, his very life is
ninety-nine percent from the mother, only one percent from the
father.</p><p>The father does not feel empathy, but the mother feels it. The
experiments have been done thousands of miles away, and still it has
affected the mother. The father remains unaffected. The father is really
not a relative; he has performed just an arbitrary function. Any syringe
could have done it – but syringes don’t feel empathy. The father is an
unnatural institution.</p><p><br></p><p>The mother’s situation is totally different. The child is her own
extension. Every small thing that has happened in the nine months when
the child was in the mother’s womb has affected the child, even the
dreams of the mother. If she was sad, the child was sad, because he was
just part of her. If she was happy, the child was happy.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see this whole world so sad, so unhappy, so miserable, one of
the reasons is that mothers are not aware when they are pregnant that
they are carrying a tremendous responsibility: they are going to create
a new being. Now it is not only a question of themselves, somebody else
is growing within them; and they should be alert not to get into fights,
into anger, into hatred, into jealousies. They should listen to great
music, they should read great poetry. They should see nature and its
beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>At least for nine months they should be as silent and meditative as
possible. This will change two lives! The child will come in the world
with a rejoicing heart; and nine months of silence and meditativeness,
music and poetry, is certainly going to change the mother too. It is
going to be mutual. She will be grateful to the child her whole life,
the child will be grateful to her – and this link continues, there is no
way to cut it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is a natural phenomenon. In animals it has not been
disturbed, but in man it has been utterly disturbed. Even in trees it
exists. It has been found... now there are scientific experiments
available: there are certain mechanisms like cardiograms which can be
attached to a tree, and the cardiograms start making the graph of how
the tree is feeling right now. An early morning sun, a beautiful breeze,
the whole night’s rest, birds singing – it is paradise; and there is a
tremendous harmony in the cardiogram, the graph is harmonious.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you tell the gardener to come with an axe to cut one of the
branches of the tree. The gardener comes with the axe – and he is far
away, but the graph starts going berserk, it loses its harmony. The
branch has not been cut yet; cutting it is only in the mind of the
gardener, but even with the mind of the gardener the tree has a certain
relatedness.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientist runs to the gardener and says, “There is no need to cut
the tree, but still come with the axe.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the mind of the gardener is changed; he is not to cut the branch,
just to bring the axe. Everything on the outside is the same, but the
graph immediately comes back to its harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most surprising thing is – this is quite mysterious – this
sensitivity of the tree is far more than that of human beings. Even
thoughts are affecting it. It is so receptive that even small waves of
thoughts passing by it are caught in its net of sensitivity.</p><p><br></p><p>But even more surprising is, when they have attached the instruments
to another tree, they were surprised to know that when the gardener was
instructed to go and cut a branch of the first tree, even a second tree,
which was not going to be cut, lost its harmony. That means it is not
only</p><p>sensitive to the gardener’s mind, it is also sensitive to the
neighboring tree. Its neighboring tree is going to be cut – that hurts
it. And when the gardener was stopped, the chaotic pattern of the graph
disappeared from both trees. They were in tune and in harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>Man thinks he has evolved. In certain ways, yes, but in certain other
ways he has lost much. His evolution is only of reason, intellect, but
he has lost, on the way, his heart. And the heart is the most
significant thing. A thousand and one rationalities cannot give you that
which a single heart full of sensitivity can give you.</p><p><br></p><p>Empathy is relating to people through the heart. But this is possible
only if the mind is silent, if there are no thoughts in the mind and it
gives way, opens the door to the heart. But ordinarily you are so full
of thoughts there is no way to be sensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when you love someone, you say, “I think I have fallen in love.”
That too, is a thought: you think. Your love is also dependent on your
thinking. You cannot do anything directly from the heart. Your mind has
been trained, educated, conditioned in every possible way and your heart
has been ignored in every possible way. By and by, you have forgotten
that the heart is far more valuable than the mind. Your mind has become
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is not a Christian, is not a Hindu, is not a Mohammedan, is
not a communist – but the mind is. Different ideologies make the mind
different. The mind is American, the mind is Russian, the mind is
Indian, the mind is Chinese. But the heart? Have you ever thought about
the heart? Is the heart also American, Indian, Russian? The heart knows
no boundaries, but it has been put into a state of nonfunctioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Your whole energy has been diverted by the educational system, by
religious teaching, by political ideologies. It has been forced to go
directly to the head and bypass the heart. Slowly slowly you start
living without the heart. And to live without the heart is not to live
at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The head is only a mechanism, a biocomputer. And soon there will be
better computers than the greatest genius’ head. It is already not of
much use. A mathematical problem that Albert Einstein could solve in
three or four days’ arduous work can be solved by the computer in a
single second. Soon you will see that the head is being replaced by the
computer.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how things change in the world. Machines replace human beings
because they function better. They don’t go on strike, they don’t make
unions, they don’t demand more wages. They simply go on working day in,
day out; they don’t even need rest. And they produce a thousand times
more than man can. Naturally, man is being replaced everywhere by
machines, technology.</p><p><br></p><p>The day is not very far away when you will be paid if you are ready
to remain unemployed. If you insist on employment you will not be paid.
You can’t have both the things together, employment and pay. If you
remain unemployed you can be paid.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, people cannot live only with employment, they need the
necessities of life; they will choose to remain unemployed and receive
the pay. But the implications are very great. When millions of people
are unemployed, have nothing to do, there is bound to be more crime,
more rapes, more divorces, more thefts, more murders, more suicides.</p><p>Man cannot just sit – unless he happens to be a sannyasin. Either
people will have to learn to sit silently, doing nothing, and let the
grass grow by itself, or they will be a constant nuisance to each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is already finished. Man has to evolve a new system of education
which directs his energies towards the heart. Machines cannot have
hearts, the computers cannot have hearts. The computers cannot fall in
love with each other, nor can they elope with somebody’s wife.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart knows something which the mind is not aware of. It knows
the way of empathy. The heart can connect itself to the whole existence.
And that will bring it great ecstasies, immense joy – as if constantly
flowers go on showering on you from nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is significant, but I don’t think you understand what
you have asked; empathy is not your experience. Once in a while lovers,
great lovers, have felt it. Once in a while great disciples and masters
have felt it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha had a disciple, Ananda, who remained with him till his
very last breath – almost forty-two years without a single break, day
in, day out, twenty-four hours a day. His relationship with Gautam
Buddha was not of the mind. The relationship between the master and the
disciple has not to be of the mind. If it is of the mind, then it is the
relationship between teacher and student. If it is of the heart, then it
is the relationship of master and disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly slowly their hearts came closer, became almost one. It is said
that before Buddha asked for water, Ananda was ready. Before Buddha said
that he was feeling cold, Ananda was already bringing the blanket. A
very underground way had opened – no need to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times Buddha would say, “Ananda, why have you brought this
water? I had not asked you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda said, “It does not matter whether you ask or not, I felt the
thirst, that my master is thirsty; I felt my master is cold. I don’t
know how, because it is not a question of my mind. Just the feeling –
and so strong a feeling that I cannot go against it. If you are not
thirsty, don’t drink.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha laughed and he said, “No. I was just inquiring how you managed
to know it. I was feeling thirsty, I was just going to say. I was
feeling cold, and I was just going to say – but you don’t allow me even
to say a thing!” Even in the night – if Gautam Buddha was not able to
sleep because there were mosquitoes, Ananda could not sleep either. The
moment Buddha awoke in the morning – exactly, simultaneously,
immediately, Ananda awoke.</p><p><br></p><p>With lovers it has happened that before your beloved says something
you know it. It is already heard by you, although it has not been
said.</p><p><br></p><p>So only in very rare cases is empathy still alive. But it has been a
great loss to humanity. It is because of the loss of empathy that we
have become unspiritual beings. It has to be regained. Getting it back
will give you a totally new, luminous existence. And then you will not
feel as an island apart from everybody else, but just part of an
infinite continent. And just to feel it is so relaxing, to feel that you
are one with the trees, and one with the rivers, and one with the stars.
Then for the first time you will know what beauty is, what bliss is,
what life is. All that you have to do is to behead yourself.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but a subtle way of beheading! Your head
remains in its place, but loses all its content, becomes hollow. When
the head is empty, the heart is full. When the head is full, the heart
is empty, because you have only that much energy. You can’t have both.
Up to now, humanity has chosen the head. And you can see the
consequence: the whole earth has become a madhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins have to change the whole direction of their life force
towards the heart. And then you will see a new intensity, a new totality
– something that was so close and yet of which you were unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>Empathy is an experience of the heart. Yes, it is the life current,
it is life itself. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>FOR CENTURIES THE BRITISH BOBBY, WITH NO GUN, ONLY A SMALL TRUNCHEON,
HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF THE RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN A CIVILIZED
COUNTRY. NOW RIOTERS ARE ATTACKING THE POLICE WITH SHOTGUNS AND GAS
BOMBS. IN THE LATEST RIOT TWO HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED AND ONE
KILLED WITH A HATCHET. A SENIOR OFFICER SAID, “THIS IS NOT ENGLAND, THIS
IS MADNESS. THEY ARE USING MY MEN FOR TARGET PRACTICE.”</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS CAUSING THIS SURGE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST LAW AND ORDER? COULD
IT HAPPEN IN AMERICA?</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to happen everywhere. But before we discuss it, a few of
your misconceptions have to be completely dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>You say England was a very cultured society<span class=s4></span>England has been the greatest empire in the world,</p><p>it has exploited millions of people as barbariously as possible. And
you call England a cultured, a civilized country? It looked civilized,
because all its barbariousness was being expressed all around the earth
in the British empire. All ugly people were sent – in the armies, in the
civil services, as governors, as governor-generals – outside England.
And the empire was vast. It was said the sun never sets on the British
empire and it was true. Somewhere or other the sun was still there in
the British empire.</p><p><br></p><p>So it had a very simple way of sending the barbarious elements to the
empire, to torture people, to kill people, and to bring all the riches
from the whole world to England. Naturally, when all the riches were
available to England, there was no need for riots, no need to fight.
England had the best universities – Oxford, Cambridge and others.</p><p><br></p><p>England has done so many ugly acts that you will not be able to
believe it. India – which was the biggest part of England’s empire – was
one of the ancientmost countries on the earth. It had its own developed
craftsmen, arts. For example, they used to make such thin cloth in
Dacca, in Bengal, that you could cover a whole elephant with the cloth
and still you could pass the whole cloth through a small finger ring, it
was so thin. Thousands of years of craftsmanship<span class=s4></span>Even if you had seven layers</p><p>of it on your body, you would still be seen as naked. Millions of
people were involved in creating that</p><p>kind of cloth. The Britishers were in a difficulty. They cut the
hands of millions of craftsmen so that they could sell Manchester cloth
in India – and you call England a civilized, cultured country?</p><p><br></p><p>In one place in Punjab, there is a public park, Jalianwala Bagh. It
has only one entrance. They were having a peaceful meeting – almost one
hundred thousand men, women and children inside the park, which has
eight-foot-tall walls all around, and just a single small gate. A
British general fixed a machine gun on the gate and ordered the people
to vacate the park within ten minutes. Now, that was impossible; it was
a walled garden, people could not get out of it, and the gate was
already closed, with the machine gun fixed. The name of the general was
Dyer. And after ten minutes he started shooting absolutely innocent
people, who had not done anything. Within minutes there were only
corpses of children, women, men – one hundred thousand. It was such a
blatant, cruel act. What punishment did General Dyer get? Only one
punishment: he was sent back to England. You kill one hundred thousand
people for no reason, and this is a cultured and civilized country?</p><p><br></p><p>People in England were rich, not because they had produced the
riches, but because they had exploited the whole empire. They squeezed
the last drop of blood from countries like India. Of course, England was
happy – at the cost of millions of people dying in poverty. You have
taken all their gold, silver, their diamonds, their mines. You have
taken everything from them.</p><p><br></p><p>And England is a small country, not big enough even to be compared to
a state in India. India consists of thirty states now – British India
was even bigger, because now Pakistan is separate, Bangladesh is
separate. But even now India is thirty times bigger than England.</p><p><br></p><p>England was a parasite. Of course, the British behaved well, they
were very cultured; they were ladies and they were gentlemen. And what
were they doing around the world? They never considered other human
beings equal to them. All other human beings, whom they were exploiting
and on whose blood they were living, were treated like animals.</p><p><br></p><p>All these riches pouring in from all over the world made England
really beautiful, rich, educated, cultured. But now the empire has
disappeared. Now England is going down the drain. And now all those
people whom England has trained to kill and murder are turning upon
their own people. Every action has its reaction. You cannot escape from
the basic laws of life. England will have to suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me: Why is it that there were no riots in England
before, and now hundreds of people are being killed, policemen are being
killed?</p><p><br></p><p>There will be more riots, because England has become accustomed to
all the riches which are no longer coming. It has become accustomed to
having all the luxuries without producing them. Now from where can it
get all those riches? Now it is the darkest and the most dismal country
on the earth. But that’s how existence functions. If you do something
wrong, you are bound to suffer. If you do something right, existence is
very rewarding.</p><p><br></p><p>England has done so much wrong in the past three hundred years that
it seems difficult for it even to survive. All that glory and glamor was
borrowed, stolen; forcibly, violently taken away from others. Now that
glory is gone; those beautiful days have become dreams. People are
unemployed. England is becoming every day poorer and poorer. And the
people have become accustomed to being violent, violent with others, in
the past; now they will be violent with themselves, with their own. It
is absolutely natural, and absolutely justified.</p><p>It is going to happen to all those countries which have been living
on exploitation, whose culture depends on somebody else’s blood. It is
bound to happen. It is simply the law of life. You cannot go on against
the law for long. Sooner or later it takes you over.</p><p><br></p><p>Now England is just a pauper country. And there is no way to create
the empire again, those days are gone. England will suffer much violence
in the future from its own people. It has done that violence to other
people; the ghosts of all those people will follow it.</p><p><br></p><p>England has no future. Darkness and more darkness<span class=s4></span>And all that old nonsense of being cultured</p><p>and civilized is already disappearing; the barbarious reality is
showing its face. This is going to happen almost everywhere, for
different reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in India only ten families have half the income and
money of the whole country. Ten families have money equal to that of
eight hundred million people! How long can you manage such a state?
Eight hundred million people are going, sooner or later, to destroy
these families. The money belongs to them, they have produced it – and
they are dying, their children don’t have milk, their parents don’t have
medicine. It is going to happen everywhere. Reasons may be different,
but everywhere violence is going to erupt like volcanoes.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me: Can this happen in America too? If it cannot, it
should. It is a strange country. The people to whom the land belongs
have been forced to live in reservations – the Red Indians – and the
people who are ruling the country and have become the owners of the
country are all foreigners.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only country where the people of the land don’t bother at
all about freedom, don’t think at all that they have been enslaved, that
their beautiful country has been taken away by foreigners. And the
foreigners have some nerve!</p><p><br></p><p>We have been here for four years. I came with a legal visa, I am here
legally. It is up to them to decide, and they are such chickens they
cannot decide either yes or no. They don’t want to say yes. They are
afraid – and rightly afraid, because I can prove very dangerous! They
cannot say no, because the moment they say no, the whole file moves from
their hands, and I go to the court.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not only a question of my green card; I will make it a
question of freedom for the native Americans. I will ask the Supreme
Court, “If you have any sense of justice, if you have any respect for
your Constitution, then no foreigner can be in the government. Red
Indians should form the government. And all the foreigners should apply
for citizenship. If their forefathers committed a sin, forget all about
it; they are gone and there is no way to punish them. But they have left
generations behind which are answerable. And if the Red Indians want you
to be here, you can be here; otherwise, just get back to your own
countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>And if Red Indians are in the government, the possibility of a third
world war simply disappears, because Red Indians will not be at all
interested, or even ready for a third world war. They will not pile up
nuclear weapons – they cannot create them.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the foreigners who call themselves Americans have taken it
for granted that this is their country. Sheer bullshit! They can ask for
refuge, they can ask the Red Indians to be allowed to live here – but
they cannot live here as masters. Enough is enough.</p><p>There is an old prophecy of the Red Indians – they have informed me,
and I said perhaps it is right – that somebody from the East will come
and deliver them from their slavery. Perhaps I have come!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHAT IS THE EGO? IT SEEMS A COMPLEMENTARY QUESTION TO “WHO AM I?” AND
AS MUCH A KOAN.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is just the opposite of your real self. The ego is not you.
The ego is the deception created by the society so that you can continue
playing with the toy and never ask about the real thing. That’s why my
insistence that unless you drop the ego, you will never come to know
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>When you were born you had your authentic self. Then they started
creating a false self: you are Christian, you are Catholic, you are
white, you are German and you are the chosen race of God, you are
supposed to rule over the world, and so on and so forth. They create a
false idea who you are. They give you a name and around the name they
create ambitions, conditionings.</p><p><br></p><p>And by and by – because it takes almost one-third of your life – they
work on your ego through the school, through the church, college,
university.… By the time you come back home from the university you have
forgotten completely your innocent being. You are now a very big ego
with a gold medal, first class, topping the university. Now you are
ready to go into the world.</p><p><br></p><p>This ego has all the desires, ambitions, wants to be always on the
top of everything. You are exploited by this ego. And this never allows
you even a glimpse of your real authentic self, and your life is there,
in your authenticity. Hence, this ego only produces misery, suffering,
fighting, frustration, madness, suicide, murder – all kinds of
crime.</p><p><br></p><p>A seeker of truth has to begin from this very point: that whatever
you have been told by the society you are, discard it. Certainly you are
not it, because nobody can know who you are except yourself – neither
your parents, nor your teachers, nor your priests. Except yourself,
nobody can enter into the privacy of your being. So nobody knows about
you; whatever they have said about you is all wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Put it aside. Dismantle the whole ego! In destroying the ego, you
will discover your being. And that discovery is the greatest discovery
possible, because it starts a totally new pilgrimage towards ultimate
bliss, towards eternal life.</p><p><br></p><p>You can choose: either frustration, suffering, misery – then go on
holding the ego, nourishing it. Or peace, silence, bliss – but then you
have to recover your innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IS SYNCHRONICITY THE VERY LAW OF LIFE?</p><p>It is exactly the same as empathy. It is a scientific name for
empathy – synchronicity. There is no difference between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>CAN YOU SORT OUT THE BIG PEAS, THE SMALL PEAS, AND THE MIDDLE
PEAS?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a difficult problem. First I have to tell you the story from
which the question has arisen.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second world war, one of the German professors of philosophy
was recruited into the army. He was not willing, but you know, Germany
is Germany: willing or not willing.… From higher up orders were that
everybody had to be recruited, the whole of Germany had to become a
military camp; only then can you conquer the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor philosopher said many times, “I am of no use,” but nobody
listened to him. The first day, early in the morning, he was to learn
marching, and the colonel ordered, “Left turn,” but he remained standing
still. Everybody else turned left.</p><p><br></p><p>The colonel knew that he was a philosopher, was bound to be a crank.
He could not even turn left. But the colonel thought, “I will see him
later on.” Then he went on saying, “Turn right... backward...
forward...” and the philosopher just remained standing in his place, as
he was. Finally, the line came back to its old position. The colonel
asked the professor, “Why didn’t you follow the orders?”</p><p><br></p><p>The professor said, “What is the point? If all these people, after
all these left turns and right turns and backwards and forwards, have to
come to the same place where I am already standing, I don’t see the
point. And as far as I am concerned, I cannot do anything unless I have
a reason to do it. You simply said, ‘Left turn.’ I thought it over. I
could not find any reason why – why should I turn left? In the whole
world there is no reason for me to turn left, or right, or go back, or
come forward. This is all stupid!”</p><p><br></p><p>The colonel reported to the higher authorities, and they said, “What
to do with this man?... because he cannot be trained if he asks about
everything, ‘Why?’” In the army you are not supposed to ask why.</p><p><br></p><p>The general knew about the professor; he was a famous man. He said,
“Don’t torture that poor man. Put him in the mess and give him some
small work.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he was put in the mess, and given some small work. He was given a
pile of peas and told, “You have to sort it out: small peas on one side,
big peas on the other side.”</p><p><br></p><p>After one and a half hours, the officer came back. The professor was
sitting exactly as he left him, and the peas were also sitting exactly
as he had left them. The officer asked, “What is the matter? Can’t you
do even that?”</p><p><br></p><p>The professor said, “It is such a philosophical matter. I have been
pondering over it for one and a half hours. It is good – big peas on
this side, small peas on this side. But what about the middle ones? And
unless I am clear about everything, I don’t take a single step!”</p><p>And you are asking me how much time it will take for me to sort out
big peas from small peas. I don’t think I can manage it, for the simple
reason that I have to go to pee right now!</p><p><br></p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

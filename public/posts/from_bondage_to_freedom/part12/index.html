Judas betrayed Jesus, nobody can betray me – because Jesus asked for faith, and I don’t ask for any faith from you.\nJesus asked people to believe in him; he is the savior. I do not ask you to believe in me but to believe in yourself, because nobody can save you except yourself. There is no other savior than yourself.\nHow can you betray me? You can only betray yourself.\nThat’s what Sheela and her gang have done. They have betrayed their own spiritual growth.\nAnd the remaining people – you mentioned Siddha, Deeksha, Makima – these people were forced to leave by Sheela. They still love me, as they have always loved me.\nJust the other day Richard came back from Santa Fe, the city of the camels, and he was surprised that they are all immensely happy that Sheela has left, and they all want to come back. Hundreds of others who have left will be coming back. This time they will find a totally different climate, fresh air. Now one can breathe; otherwise, people were getting suffocated.\nThey tried hard to live under Sheela and her gang, but there is a limit to human patience. Finally they decided it is better to leave. How much can you tolerate humiliation, and humiliation by someone who was nobody. Sheela was just a waitress in a hotel in America before she came to me. And I made her a queen of a whole kingdom of sannyasins all over the world.\nIt was great for Makima to have tolerated her for almost three years. Makima comes from one of the most super-rich families, and Sheela was forcing her to drive trucks. She had always been chauffeured, and now she was driving big trucks; but she accepted it out of love for me, because she wanted to remain here. Amrit, her boyfriend, was a doctor.\nBut Sheela’s assistant, and the mastermind in this whole gang of fascists, was Puja, who has been harassing all the doctors, all the nurses, everybody, in every possible way. She would write prescriptions and force the doctors to sign them. It is illegal. Patience is one thing, but to be forced to do illegal things is not right.\nPuja herself was capable of prescribing medicines – she was a perfectly educated nurse, had a license to prescribe medicines just like any doctor, but she was absolutely cunning.\nThe doctors were not willing, because the things that were prescribed were not relevant to the sickness, to the person at all. But those prescriptions were not for the sickness, they were punishments. Amrit did not become part of all the crimes that they were doing; he left with tears in his eyes. And I know Makima: whatever happens, her love for me cannot change.\nThese people have not betrayed me. These people have been forced to go away from here. Sheela was afraid of all those people who were more intelligent than her – and almost everybody is more intelligent than her. She is not educated; I had to teach her each and every thing. From a hotel waitress, I made her a celebrity all over the world. And this is the reward and gratitude that she has shown me.\nNaturally, anybody who is in power and feels that there are people who are far more intelligent remains in a kind of phobia, wanting somehow to get rid of these people.\nThe chancellor of the university, Amitabh, left. The vice-chancellor of the university, Siddha, left. Both were unique individuals, but both will be back soon.\nShiva, who had been a guard for many years – she forced him to leave. And the way to force him was through humiliation, giving him jobs which the man had never done. The day he left.I used\nto go driving outside the commune. Just near Krishnamurti Lake, at the end, he was kneeling down on his knees, tears in his eyes, to say goodbye to me. He has not betrayed.\nAnd they are all informing me that they want to come back, because the reason that they had to leave has disappeared.\nSo remember, these people were not Judases – except Sheela, who proved really poisonous. But I can understand her problem. She had come to power, she had never seen so much money in her life passing through her hands.\nShe had a bank balance in Switzerland. She slowly slowly siphoned money coming here from European communes – forty-three million dollars. It is in the name of Sheela and Savita – it was said in front of Hasya and Savita promised that before she left she would give all the details to Hasya. She has not given any details, she simply escaped.\nThe only person who has betrayed is Sheela.\nI have always respected women. Sheela has betrayed that respect.\nThe whole commune I had given into the hands of women. It will not be so anymore. Now men will have an equal share of power in everything.\nIt is a crime against womankind. I was trying to give some compensation to women because they have suffered so long, for thousands of years. But I am having second thoughts: perhaps they needed that suffering.\nOne of India’s great poets, Tulsidas, writes in one of his poems, “Animals, untouchables, and women, once in a while need a good beating.” I have always condemned that man, but Sheela and her group have proved Tulsidas was not wrong. I was not right; perhaps Tulsidas is right. I have been always a supporter of women’s liberation, but Sheela and her gang have proved that if women are in power, Hitlers will be forgotten.\nEven one FBI person was overheard to say here that when he saw all the bugging devices he was amazed, he could not believe it. He said that whoever has done this has surpassed Nixon and Watergate, because the way it was done was far more sophisticated.\nAnd how many houses have they bugged? The whole hotel – all the rooms were bugged. Anybody staying in the hotel was staying in an imprisonment. Even bathrooms were bugged. You could not be allowed to have your thoughts or just sing a song of your own without it being known to Sheela immediately.\nShe had bugged my room. She was continually insisting for many days that a switch for a buzzer was needed – a buzzer for the guards who are on the roof of my house – so “if you see any emergency you can inform them.”\nI said, “I live in the room. The curtains are drawn almost the whole day, except only for one hour – half an hour when I take my lunch, half an hour when I take my supper. And anyway, if somebody is coming towards the house the guards on the roof will see him first. Their visibility is bigger. And I mostly sit with closed eyes. It is absolutely useless; but if you want to put it in, just for your satisfaction you can.”\nBut it was not a switch for the buzzer only. Yes, on the surface it was a switch for the buzzer to the guards, but inside the switch was a microphone. Now the guards have come crying to inform\nme, “We were seeing it every day: Julian continually coming to change the tape” – the tape was in the bathroom of the guards. “We could not open our mouths because Sheela convinced us that it was for the master’s safety: ‘If anybody enters the room – he sits with closed eyes – if something happens in the room, you will immediately know.’”\nSince that buzzer was fixed I was puzzled only about one thing, that whenever she wanted to talk about something that she thought was very secretive – she used to sit at least four, five feet away from me – then she would come close.\nI could not understand, because even if it was secret, there was nobody in the room: what was the need to come so close? But she was not coming close to me, she was coming close to the microphone so that everything she said would be picked up exactly, and whatever reply I gave her would also be picked up. She proved a real snake.\nAnd now she is giving interviews to magazines, to television. And she is repeating two things: first, that she had to leave the commune because there was a power struggle. We had never heard about that power struggle. Who was struggling for power?\nAnd the second thing was, “I have so much information with me, almost as much as the ocean, but I will not reveal it.” That is a message to the attorney general of Oregon, to the FBI – that she is willing to reveal it if they give her immunity. Then she can save all those twenty criminals who have escaped from here, and she can point to any people and say that these are the people who did all the wrong deeds.\nAnd remember it, it is a simple principle of dirty politics that the government, FBI, and the state police do not seem to be interested in the crimes. We have given them solid proofs, and they have not taken a single step; otherwise, they could inform Interpol to arrest these twenty people and bring them here.\nThey could inform the Swiss government, they could inform the German government that these people are criminals and they should not be given shelter, before they escape into a country where the American government will have no power at all. For example, if they enter East Germany, then you will not be able to catch hold of them. And they are giving them time. The simple reason is, perhaps their agents are meeting them and finding a way that the whole thing can be forced on innocent sannyasins.\nIt has been overheard from FBI people that they would like at least five hundred sannyasins imprisoned. Strange – we give you the people who have done the crime, the people themselves have proved that they are criminals by escaping, and you want to imprison five hundred sannyasins. For what reason? To destroy the commune.\nThey will choose people who are absolutely necessary for the commune’s existence: doctors, legal experts, people who prepare your food, people who drive your buses – anybody who is in any way essential for the commune’s existence. With five hundred, they can destroy the whole commune. Their interest is not the crime that has been committed. They want to commit a bigger crime: their interest is in destroying the commune.\nAnd now Sheela is trying her last strategy: if immunity is given to her she is ready to reveal all the names of the people who have committed the crimes.\nJust the other day, STERN magazine wanted somebody from here to go to Germany for a discussion on the television with Sheela. I sent the message, “Why should anybody go there? Sheela can come here; I will face her myself, and I will see how much guts she has.” I am ready for an open discussion on television, and I am ready to expose everything she has done. Nobody else can do it. Nobody else knows her and her mind the way I know her.\nShe is telling lies to the press, unbelievable lies. I don’t possess a single thing. Everything that I use belongs to the commune, has been donated by sannyasins from all over the world. It was their gift to me. But I told her that I do not want to have any gifts, so make trusts; all those gifts should go to the trust. I want to remain exactly as I was born, without anything and that’s the way I want to go from the world – without anything. But if people love me around the world, and go on sending gifts, then make separate trusts for everything.\nThere are now ninety Rolls Royces. And she is saying in an interview with STERN that for one Rolls Royce I threatened that if she did not bring one Rolls Royce more I would commit suicide. It is simply so absurd. And it is against the law of economics. Everybody knows the law of diminishing returns: If you have one Rolls Royce, you may have great joy – but with ninety Rolls Royces, each Rolls Royce becomes less valuable.\nIn the whole world there is nobody else who has ninety Rolls Royces. So whether I have ninety or ninety-one does not make any difference: I am already on the top! And now, after ninety Rolls Royces, one more Rolls Royce – what value can it have to me? And for that one Rolls Royce I will commit suicide? She is going almost insane. She looks on the television completely drugged. If she has any courage, she should come here – no harm will be done to her. She should just face me, and let it be known to the whole world.\nBefore me, she becomes just a mouse, starts crying and weeping – the same ancient female technology. It has happened so many times – crying and weeping and sobbing, so that just to get rid of her, I would say, “Okay, do whatever you want to do.”\nJust last night it happened – one interviewer went on and on, on and on. There seemed to be no end to his questions; he had almost a whole book of questions. Just to stop him somewhereIt\nwas getting to be ten at night, and he asked, “Do you agree with Socrates and his dictum, ‘Know thyself’?”\nI said, “I absolutely agree.” And I had to stand up and tell him that I had to agree, otherwise this interview would never end! Otherwise, who is going to agree with that old Socrates, who was a homosexual?\nBut to bring up all that would mean the interview would continue: Is homosexuality the way to know thyself? Socrates is the most prominent homosexual the world has known. And now that we know about AIDS, he will have to take the responsibility for it. Knowing thyself turned into a very dangerous disease, AIDS. But to finish the interview.… It had become almost a torture; for three hours.…\nAnd that was the situation with Sheela. How can she manage to face me? And if she was courageous enough to face me, at least she would have come to say goodbye to me. She did not even come to say goodbye to me. She escaped like a thief, a murderer. She has degraded, in my eyes, the status of womanhood.\nShe could do anything. She deserted her husband when he was seriously ill, and began a love affair with another sannyasin. This was a great shock to her husband and may have caused his death. She then married an American and, without divorcing him, or even telling him that she was divorcing him, she then married a Swiss sannyasin, so that when she escaped from here she had a home in Switzerland. This is bigamy – a big crime.\nWhen she became aware there that she had committed a crime, she rushed to Nepal – a small Himalayan kingdom in India, very poor, with perhaps the poorest people in the world, where you can give a small bribe to any magistrate and you can get a back-dated divorce.\nSo now she has a Nepalese back-dated divorce. Strange – why should one go to Nepal for a back- dated divorce? It was necessary. You cannot get, in any cultured country, a back-dated divorce so easily. And when you are married to an American husband, you should divorce him in America. There are possibilities – there are states where you can go and get a divorce. But she could not come back to America. The American husband perhaps still does not know that he is divorced. The poor fellow still believes that he is her husband!\nSo the only person who has proved a Judas is Sheela. But even Judas was better than Sheela, far better and far superior, because when he realized the crime that he had done he committed suicide – just within twenty-four hours. Handing over Jesus for thirty silver pieces to the enemiesHe must\nhave been a man of conscience; he hanged himself from a tree.\nChristians don’t talk of him, his crucifixion is not at all discussed in churches. He crucified himself. It was a great understanding that what he had done was wrong – a great repentance.\nSheela does not have even that conscience. And with a man like meif she had come to me, even\nif she comes to me now, with her whole gang, and confesses that they had committed these things and they feel guilty, I will take all their crimes on myself – because to me, to live tomorrow does not mean anything. I have attained whatever life is capable of attaining. I have experienced the ultimate peak of life, love, light.\nThere is no problem, I can take the whole load of crimes, but at least I should know what the load is; otherwise, how can I take it on myself?\nThose twenty people have not yet known anything, so rather than sending them to prison, I would prefer myself to be hanged. And they have committed enough crimes, enough for a death sentence for one single man. That will help the commune. That will help those people.\nBut instead of doing that, Sheela is lying to the press – which is not going to help. Lying has never helped anybody. It is truth that liberates.\nAnd my love for all those criminals remains the same, because I have never loved anybody while asking them to be according to me, to my ideas. I have never put any condition on my love. My love is unconditional.\nThey can come and see what unconditional love can do. I will take all their burden on me, because to me it does not matter. But all those twenty people have still to realize themselves; they have not even found the blessed state in which I am – now no death can destroy it.\nSo I am the right person to be hanged for all their crimes. I would like them to confess, and I would like you to forgive them, because love knows infinite forgiveness.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nHOW IS IT THAT ALTHOUGH I FEEL SO SERENE AND IN HARMONY WHEN I AM WITNESSING, I STILL SPEND MOST OF MY TIME IN A DAZE? I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY I CONTINUE TO SLEEP, WHEN THE RARE MOMENTS THAT I SURFACE ARE SO EXQUISITE.\nJust old habit. Old habits die hard, but they do die. Don’t be worried! Question 3\nBELOVED MASTER,\nYOU SAID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IF THE AUTHORITIES DON’T ACT, WE WILL TAKE MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS, AND BRING THEM BACK HERE. THIS WILL PRESUMABLY INVOLVE KIDNAPPING, FALSE ARREST, AND OTHER CRIMES EVERY BIT AS SERIOUS AS THOSE OF SHEELA AND HER GANG. IF YOU ORDER THIS, HOW IS YOUR BRAND OF FASCISM AND ANARCHY DIFFERENT FROM SHEELA’S?\nI have just answered that my way of bringing them here will not be fascist. It will be my love, my forgiveness, that will bring them here.\nBut whosoever is asking the question is an authentic camel. Question 4\nBELOVED MASTER,\nIT FEELS AS IF THE LESSON THAT HAS COME OUT OF OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TEACHING US ALL ALONG – THAT ALL HOPE IS FALSE, AND THAT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT DREAMS AND ILLUSIONS. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nIs there any need to comment? Question 5\nBELOVED MASTER,\nWE ARE FEELING A TREMENDOUS GRATITUDE AND EVEN DEEPER LOVE FOR YOU. SHEELA HAS GONE OF HER OWN CHOICE, AND SEEING THE SCOPE OF HER CRIMINAL\nACTIVITIES, I CAN’T HELP FEELING THAT SHE ONLY LEFT BECAUSE SHE COULDN’T CONTROL YOU, NO MATTER HOW SHE TRIED. THE ROCK WAS SHATTERED BY THE FLOWER. MASTER, CAN WE EVER THANK YOU?\nThat’s something to be remembered: The rock can be shattered by a roseflower. And that is our power.\nIn the last press conference you heard a question from a journalist, and I said, “If any harm is done to my innocent people, then no American embassy anywhere in the world will be allowed to function. And my people can hijack any American planes.” But that was just a joke! We do not need to do such things.\nOur power is of love, of innocence.\nAnd whosoever will clash with our love and innocence will be shattered.\nEven nuclear weapons are not more powerful than love, because death can never be more powerful than life. Guns can never be more powerful than laughter.\nSo if they want to destroy us they need not take unnecessary trouble and go in circles, give immunity to the criminals and force the innocent to be punished – there is no need. You can have a beautiful Hiroshima here, you can just drop a hydrogen bomb. And that will be something, because you don’t have what Japan has: a Nagasaki, a Hiroshima – America is missing. You can also brag then, that you also have a Hiroshima.\nBut this Hiroshima will be totally different. People will be dancing, laughing, loving, and they will welcome death. There will be no despair, no anguish, no fear. Try it. That will become a precedent for the whole world. Our laughter, our dance, our song, our music, will remain haunting the politicians for their whole life.\nWhy take such long routes? It is so strange.… The KGB in Soviet Russia is persecuting my sannyasins there, and they are continuously hammering in their minds that I am a CIA agent. And the CIA and the FBI are trying to destroy this commune. Perhaps they think I belong to the KGB.\nI am certainly a unique person! No other person has that distinction. Either you belong to the KGB or you belong to the CIA – and I am riding on both! And I am enjoying the ride, and seeing how stupid human beings can be.\nI have no interest in politics, neither in the CIA nor in the KGB. My interest is in humanity, in values that can make man flower. I am certainly in love with the American Constitution, because it is the only hope for humanity. But American politicians are corrupting it as much as possible. So it seems that we will have to fight to save the American Constitution and its values against the Americans!\nFrom all the courts of America the BIBLE should be thrown out. It is nothing but pornography. And when you have a beautiful document like the American Constitution, why go to third-rate pornography, and keep it in courts for people to take the oath on? And still you go on thinking that you are not mixing religion with the government! You are mixing religion with government.\nAnd politicians are in a difficulty – I can understand. The American Constitution was made by real, authentic lovers of humanity. But the reward for such people is assassination.\nAbraham Lincoln was assassinated – the only politician in the whole world of whom it can be said that he was not political. His only fault was that he was not political.\nTwenty percent of the American presidents have been assassinated; and the American president has the most sophisticated security arrangements. And in these twenty percent were the best American presidents. The third-grade eighty percent nobody bothers about. Who bothers to assassinate Ronald Reagan? Why waste a bullet? Nobody bothered about Jimmy Carter.\nDo you know where Jimmy Carter is, and where his smile is? Both have disappeared. In the last pictures of him I have seen there is no smile. And what happened to Jimmy Carter? You will know only one day when he dies. Then there will be in newspapers a small news item, that “Jimmy Carter, ex-president of America, died.”\nWho wants to kill people who don’t have any high ideals? To have high ideals in your life is dangerous, because the world is full of retarded people; they cannot tolerate you, your presence. Your very existence makes them feel that they are retarded.\nAbraham Lincoln had to be assassinated. The Kennedys, both the brothers, had to be assassinated. Something beautiful could have come out of those two Kennedys. The first Kennedy was a beautiful man – young, fresh, available for new ideas. And the second Kennedy was even more intelligent than the first.\nIt is a very strange world. You destroy your best flowers, and you preserve plants which never flower, never come to fruition.\nI am not a politician, I am not a religious leader. But Sheela, while I was in isolation, had created a few things which have to be withdrawn.\nFirst, the book of RAJNEESHISM is not my writing, nor my discourses; it was Sheela and her group’s creation, so it should not be printed again. There is no thing like Rajneeshism – because then it becomes again another Christianity, another communism, another Hinduism. I have been fighting my whole life against all “isms,” and these people made an “ism” out of me!\nThey created the word “Rajneeshee.” You have to drop that word; otherwise, what is the difference between a Christian, a Jew and a Rajneeshee? I want you to be yourself, not a Rajneeshee.\nYou love me – that does not mean that you have to become a Rajneeshee. You can love me without becoming a Rajneeshee. And what these Rajneeshees have done, this gang of twenty Rajneeshees, is enough to condemn the word.\nSo now, there are no longer any Rajneeshees. You are individuals, totally free individuals. Out of your freedom and love you are here. There is no bondage, there is no contract. There is no surrender, there is no faith.\nAnd today I would like to declare something immensely important, because I feel perhaps this helped Sheela and her people to exploit you. I don’t know whether tomorrow I will be here or not, so it is better to do it while I am here and make you free from any other possibility of such a fascist regime.\nThat is, from today, you are free to use any color of clothes. If you feel like using red clothes, that is up to you. And this message has to be sent all over the world to all the communes. It will be more beautiful to have all the colors. I had always dreamed of seeing you in all the colors of the rainbow.\nToday we claim the rainbow to be our colors.\nThe second thing: you return your malas – unless you wish otherwise. That is your choice, but it is not a necessity anymore. You return your malas to President Hasya.

OF JESUS, BETRAYING HIM, AND SIDDHA, THE VICE-CHANCELLOR OF OUR
MEDITATION UNIVERSITY, AND OTHER INFLUENTIAL LEADERS AND POWERFUL PEOPLE
OF THE COMMUNE, LIKE PRABODHI, DEEKSHA, SHIVA, MAKIMA, SOMENDRA,
SUSHILA, DIVYA, ETCETERA GOING AGAINST YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great difference. Judas betrayed Jesus, nobody can betray
me – because Jesus asked for faith, and I don’t ask for any faith from
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus asked people to believe in him; he is the savior. I do not ask
you to believe in me but to believe in yourself, because nobody can save
you except yourself. There is no other savior than yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you betray me? You can only betray yourself.</p><p>That’s what Sheela and her gang have done. They have betrayed their
own spiritual growth.</p><p><br></p><p>And the remaining people – you mentioned Siddha, Deeksha, Makima –
these people were forced to leave by Sheela. They still love me, as they
have always loved me.</p><p>Just the other day Richard came back from Santa Fe, the city of the
camels, and he was surprised that they are all immensely happy that
Sheela has left, and they all want to come back. Hundreds of others who
have left will be coming back. This time they will find a totally
different climate, fresh air. Now one can breathe; otherwise, people
were getting suffocated.</p><p><br></p><p>They tried hard to live under Sheela and her gang, but there is a
limit to human patience. Finally they decided it is better to leave. How
much can you tolerate humiliation, and humiliation by someone who was
nobody. Sheela was just a waitress in a hotel in America before she came
to me. And I made her a queen of a whole kingdom of sannyasins all over
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It was great for Makima to have tolerated her for almost three years.
Makima comes from one of the most super-rich families, and Sheela was
forcing her to drive trucks. She had always been chauffeured, and now
she was driving big trucks; but she accepted it out of love for me,
because she wanted to remain here. Amrit, her boyfriend, was a
doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>But Sheela’s assistant, and the mastermind in this whole gang of
fascists, was Puja, who has been harassing all the doctors, all the
nurses, everybody, in every possible way. She would write prescriptions
and force the doctors to sign them. It is illegal. Patience is one
thing, but to be forced to do illegal things is not right.</p><p><br></p><p>Puja herself was capable of prescribing medicines – she was a
perfectly educated nurse, had a license to prescribe medicines just like
any doctor, but she was absolutely cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctors were not willing, because the things that were prescribed
were not relevant to the sickness, to the person at all. But those
prescriptions were not for the sickness, they were punishments. Amrit
did not become part of all the crimes that they were doing; he left with
tears in his eyes. And I know Makima: whatever happens, her love for me
cannot change.</p><p><br></p><p>These people have not betrayed me. These people have been forced to
go away from here. Sheela was afraid of all those people who were more
intelligent than her – and almost everybody is more intelligent than
her. She is not educated; I had to teach her each and every thing. From
a hotel waitress, I made her a celebrity all over the world. And this is
the reward and gratitude that she has shown me.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, anybody who is in power and feels that there are people
who are far more intelligent remains in a kind of phobia, wanting
somehow to get rid of these people.</p><p><br></p><p>The chancellor of the university, Amitabh, left. The vice-chancellor
of the university, Siddha, left. Both were unique individuals, but both
will be back soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva, who had been a guard for many years – she forced him to leave.
And the way to force him was through humiliation, giving him jobs which
the man had never done. The day he left.<span class=s4></span>I
used</p><p>to go driving outside the commune. Just near Krishnamurti Lake, at
the end, he was kneeling down on his knees, tears in his eyes, to say
goodbye to me. He has not betrayed.</p><p><br></p><p>And they are all informing me that they want to come back, because
the reason that they had to leave has disappeared.</p><p>So remember, these people were not Judases – except Sheela, who
proved really poisonous. But I can understand her problem. She had come
to power, she had never seen so much money in her life passing through
her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a bank balance in Switzerland. She slowly slowly siphoned
money coming here from European communes – forty-three million dollars.
It is in the name of Sheela and Savita – it was said in front of Hasya
and Savita promised that before she left she would give all the details
to Hasya. She has not given any details, she simply escaped.</p><p><br></p><p>The only person who has betrayed is Sheela.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always respected women. Sheela has betrayed that respect.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole commune I had given into the hands of women. It will not be
so anymore. Now men will have an equal share of power in everything.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a crime against womankind. I was trying to give some
compensation to women because they have suffered so long, for thousands
of years. But I am having second thoughts: perhaps they needed that
suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>One of India’s great poets, Tulsidas, writes in one of his poems,
“Animals, untouchables, and women, once in a while need a good beating.”
I have always condemned that man, but Sheela and her group have proved
Tulsidas was not wrong. I was not right; perhaps Tulsidas is right. I
have been always a supporter of women’s liberation, but Sheela and her
gang have proved that if women are in power, Hitlers will be
forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>Even one FBI person was overheard to say here that when he saw all
the bugging devices he was amazed, he could not believe it. He said that
whoever has done this has surpassed Nixon and Watergate, because the way
it was done was far more sophisticated.</p><p><br></p><p>And how many houses have they bugged? The whole hotel – all the rooms
were bugged. Anybody staying in the hotel was staying in an
imprisonment. Even bathrooms were bugged. You could not be allowed to
have your thoughts or just sing a song of your own without it being
known to Sheela immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>She had bugged my room. She was continually insisting for many days
that a switch for a buzzer was needed – a buzzer for the guards who are
on the roof of my house – so “if you see any emergency you can inform
them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I live in the room. The curtains are drawn almost the whole
day, except only for one hour – half an hour when I take my lunch, half
an hour when I take my supper. And anyway, if somebody is coming towards
the house the guards on the roof will see him first. Their visibility is
bigger. And I mostly sit with closed eyes. It is absolutely useless; but
if you want to put it in, just for your satisfaction you can.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it was not a switch for the buzzer only. Yes, on the surface it
was a switch for the buzzer to the guards, but inside the switch was a
microphone. Now the guards have come crying to inform</p><p>me, “We were seeing it every day: Julian continually coming to change
the tape” – the tape was in the bathroom of the guards. “We could not
open our mouths because Sheela convinced us that it was for the master’s
safety: ‘If anybody enters the room – he sits with closed eyes – if
something happens in the room, you will immediately know.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Since that buzzer was fixed I was puzzled only about one thing, that
whenever she wanted to talk about something that she thought was very
secretive – she used to sit at least four, five feet away from me – then
she would come close.</p><p><br></p><p>I could not understand, because even if it was secret, there was
nobody in the room: what was the need to come so close? But she was not
coming close to me, she was coming close to the microphone so that
everything she said would be picked up exactly, and whatever reply I
gave her would also be picked up. She proved a real snake.</p><p><br></p><p>And now she is giving interviews to magazines, to television. And she
is repeating two things: first, that she had to leave the commune
because there was a power struggle. We had never heard about that power
struggle. Who was struggling for power?</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing was, “I have so much information with me, almost
as much as the ocean, but I will not reveal it.” That is a message to
the attorney general of Oregon, to the FBI – that she is willing to
reveal it if they give her immunity. Then she can save all those twenty
criminals who have escaped from here, and she can point to any people
and say that these are the people who did all the wrong deeds.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember it, it is a simple principle of dirty politics that the
government, FBI, and the state police do not seem to be interested in
the crimes. We have given them solid proofs, and they have not taken a
single step; otherwise, they could inform Interpol to arrest these
twenty people and bring them here.</p><p><br></p><p>They could inform the Swiss government, they could inform the German
government that these people are criminals and they should not be given
shelter, before they escape into a country where the American government
will have no power at all. For example, if they enter East Germany, then
you will not be able to catch hold of them. And they are giving them
time. The simple reason is, perhaps their agents are meeting them and
finding a way that the whole thing can be forced on innocent
sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been overheard from FBI people that they would like at least
five hundred sannyasins imprisoned. Strange – we give you the people who
have done the crime, the people themselves have proved that they are
criminals by escaping, and you want to imprison five hundred sannyasins.
For what reason? To destroy the commune.</p><p><br></p><p>They will choose people who are absolutely necessary for the
commune’s existence: doctors, legal experts, people who prepare your
food, people who drive your buses – anybody who is in any way essential
for the commune’s existence. With five hundred, they can destroy the
whole commune. Their interest is not the crime that has been committed.
They want to commit a bigger crime: their interest is in destroying the
commune.</p><p>And now Sheela is trying her last strategy: if immunity is given to
her she is ready to reveal all the names of the people who have
committed the crimes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, STERN magazine wanted somebody from here to go to
Germany for a discussion on the television with Sheela. I sent the
message, “Why should anybody go there? Sheela can come here; I will face
her myself, and I will see how much guts she has.” I am ready for an
open discussion on television, and I am ready to expose everything she
has done. Nobody else can do it. Nobody else knows her and her mind the
way I know her.</p><p><br></p><p>She is telling lies to the press, unbelievable lies. I don’t possess
a single thing. Everything that I use belongs to the commune, has been
donated by sannyasins from all over the world. It was their gift to me.
But I told her that I do not want to have any gifts, so make trusts; all
those gifts should go to the trust. I want to remain exactly as I was
born, without anything and that’s the way I want to go from the world –
without anything. But if people love me around the world, and go on
sending gifts, then make separate trusts for everything.</p><p><br></p><p>There are now ninety Rolls Royces. And she is saying in an interview
with STERN that for one Rolls Royce I threatened that if she did not
bring one Rolls Royce more I would commit suicide. It is simply so
absurd. And it is against the law of economics. Everybody knows the law
of diminishing returns: If you have one Rolls Royce, you may have great
joy – but with ninety Rolls Royces, each Rolls Royce becomes less
valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>In the whole world there is nobody else who has ninety Rolls Royces.
So whether I have ninety or ninety-one does not make any difference: I
am already on the top! And now, after ninety Rolls Royces, one more
Rolls Royce – what value can it have to me? And for that one Rolls Royce
I will commit suicide? She is going almost insane. She looks on the
television completely drugged. If she has any courage, she should come
here – no harm will be done to her. She should just face me, and let it
be known to the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>Before me, she becomes just a mouse, starts crying and weeping – the
same ancient female technology. It has happened so many times – crying
and weeping and sobbing, so that just to get rid of her, I would say,
“Okay, do whatever you want to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just last night it happened – one interviewer went on and on, on and
on. There seemed to be no end to his questions; he had almost a whole
book of questions. Just to stop him somewhere<span class=s4></span>It</p><p>was getting to be ten at night, and he asked, “Do you agree with
Socrates and his dictum, ‘Know thyself’?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I absolutely agree.” And I had to stand up and tell him that
I had to agree, otherwise this interview would never end! Otherwise, who
is going to agree with that old Socrates, who was a homosexual?</p><p><br></p><p>But to bring up all that would mean the interview would continue: Is
homosexuality the way to know thyself? Socrates is the most prominent
homosexual the world has known. And now that we know about AIDS, he will
have to take the responsibility for it. Knowing thyself turned into a
very dangerous disease, AIDS. But to finish the interview.… It had
become almost a torture; for three hours.…</p><p>And that was the situation with Sheela. How can she manage to face
me? And if she was courageous enough to face me, at least she would have
come to say goodbye to me. She did not even come to say goodbye to me.
She escaped like a thief, a murderer. She has degraded, in my eyes, the
status of womanhood.</p><p>She could do anything. She deserted her husband when he was seriously
ill, and began a love affair with another sannyasin. This was a great
shock to her husband and may have caused his death. She then married an
American and, without divorcing him, or even telling him that she was
divorcing him, she then married a Swiss sannyasin, so that when she
escaped from here she had a home in Switzerland. This is bigamy – a big
crime.</p><p>When she became aware there that she had committed a crime, she
rushed to Nepal – a small Himalayan kingdom in India, very poor, with
perhaps the poorest people in the world, where you can give a small
bribe to any magistrate and you can get a back-dated divorce.</p><p>So now she has a Nepalese back-dated divorce. Strange – why should
one go to Nepal for a back- dated divorce? It was necessary. You cannot
get, in any cultured country, a back-dated divorce so easily. And when
you are married to an American husband, you should divorce him in
America. There are possibilities – there are states where you can go and
get a divorce. But she could not come back to America. The American
husband perhaps still does not know that he is divorced. The poor fellow
still believes that he is her husband!</p><p>So the only person who has proved a Judas is Sheela. But even Judas
was better than Sheela, far better and far superior, because when he
realized the crime that he had done he committed suicide – just within
twenty-four hours. Handing over Jesus for thirty silver pieces to the
enemies<span class=s4></span>He must</p><p>have been a man of conscience; he hanged himself from a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians don’t talk of him, his crucifixion is not at all discussed
in churches. He crucified himself. It was a great understanding that
what he had done was wrong – a great repentance.</p><p>Sheela does not have even that conscience. And with a man like
me<span class=s4></span>if she had come to me, even</p><p>if she comes to me now, with her whole gang, and confesses that they
had committed these things and they feel guilty, I will take all their
crimes on myself – because to me, to live tomorrow does not mean
anything. I have attained whatever life is capable of attaining. I have
experienced the ultimate peak of life, love, light.</p><p>There is no problem, I can take the whole load of crimes, but at
least I should know what the load is; otherwise, how can I take it on
myself?</p><p>Those twenty people have not yet known anything, so rather than
sending them to prison, I would prefer myself to be hanged. And they
have committed enough crimes, enough for a death sentence for one single
man. That will help the commune. That will help those people.</p><p>But instead of doing that, Sheela is lying to the press – which is
not going to help. Lying has never helped anybody. It is truth that
liberates.</p><p>And my love for all those criminals remains the same, because I have
never loved anybody while asking them to be according to me, to my
ideas. I have never put any condition on my love. My love is
unconditional.</p><p>They can come and see what unconditional love can do. I will take all
their burden on me, because to me it does not matter. But all those
twenty people have still to realize themselves; they have not even found
the blessed state in which I am – now no death can destroy it.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am the right person to be hanged for all their crimes. I would
like them to confess, and I would like you to forgive them, because love
knows infinite forgiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>HOW IS IT THAT ALTHOUGH I FEEL SO SERENE AND IN HARMONY WHEN I AM
WITNESSING, I STILL SPEND MOST OF MY TIME IN A DAZE? I DON’T UNDERSTAND
WHY I CONTINUE TO SLEEP, WHEN THE RARE MOMENTS THAT I SURFACE ARE SO
EXQUISITE.</p><p><br></p><p>Just old habit. Old habits die hard, but they do die. Don’t be
worried! Question 3</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IF THE AUTHORITIES DON’T ACT, WE
WILL TAKE MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS, AND BRING THEM BACK HERE. THIS
WILL PRESUMABLY INVOLVE KIDNAPPING, FALSE ARREST, AND OTHER CRIMES EVERY
BIT AS SERIOUS AS THOSE OF SHEELA AND HER GANG. IF YOU ORDER THIS, HOW
IS YOUR BRAND OF FASCISM AND ANARCHY DIFFERENT FROM SHEELA’S?</p><p><br></p><p>I have just answered that my way of bringing them here will not be
fascist. It will be my love, my forgiveness, that will bring them
here.</p><p><br></p><p>But whosoever is asking the question is an authentic camel. Question
4</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>IT FEELS AS IF THE LESSON THAT HAS COME OUT OF OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE
IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TEACHING US ALL ALONG – THAT ALL HOPE IS FALSE,
AND THAT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT DREAMS AND
ILLUSIONS. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Is there any need to comment? Question 5</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>WE ARE FEELING A TREMENDOUS GRATITUDE AND EVEN DEEPER LOVE FOR YOU.
SHEELA HAS GONE OF HER OWN CHOICE, AND SEEING THE SCOPE OF HER
CRIMINAL</p><p>ACTIVITIES, I CAN’T HELP FEELING THAT SHE ONLY LEFT BECAUSE SHE
COULDN’T CONTROL YOU, NO MATTER HOW SHE TRIED. THE ROCK WAS SHATTERED BY
THE FLOWER. MASTER, CAN WE EVER THANK YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s something to be remembered: The rock can be shattered by a
roseflower. And that is our power.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last press conference you heard a question from a journalist,
and I said, “If any harm is done to my innocent people, then no American
embassy anywhere in the world will be allowed to function. And my people
can hijack any American planes.” But that was just a joke! We do not
need to do such things.</p><p><br></p><p>Our power is of love, of innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>And whosoever will clash with our love and innocence will be
shattered.</p><p><br></p><p>Even nuclear weapons are not more powerful than love, because death
can never be more powerful than life. Guns can never be more powerful
than laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>So if they want to destroy us they need not take unnecessary trouble
and go in circles, give immunity to the criminals and force the innocent
to be punished – there is no need. You can have a beautiful Hiroshima
here, you can just drop a hydrogen bomb. And that will be something,
because you don’t have what Japan has: a Nagasaki, a Hiroshima – America
is missing. You can also brag then, that you also have a Hiroshima.</p><p><br></p><p>But this Hiroshima will be totally different. People will be dancing,
laughing, loving, and they will welcome death. There will be no despair,
no anguish, no fear. Try it. That will become a precedent for the whole
world. Our laughter, our dance, our song, our music, will remain
haunting the politicians for their whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Why take such long routes? It is so strange.… The KGB in Soviet
Russia is persecuting my sannyasins there, and they are continuously
hammering in their minds that I am a CIA agent. And the CIA and the FBI
are trying to destroy this commune. Perhaps they think I belong to the
KGB.</p><p><br></p><p>I am certainly a unique person! No other person has that distinction.
Either you belong to the KGB or you belong to the CIA – and I am riding
on both! And I am enjoying the ride, and seeing how stupid human beings
can be.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no interest in politics, neither in the CIA nor in the KGB. My
interest is in humanity, in values that can make man flower. I am
certainly in love with the American Constitution, because it is the only
hope for humanity. But American politicians are corrupting it as much as
possible. So it seems that we will have to fight to save the American
Constitution and its values against the Americans!</p><p><br></p><p>From all the courts of America the BIBLE should be thrown out. It is
nothing but pornography. And when you have a beautiful document like the
American Constitution, why go to third-rate pornography, and keep it in
courts for people to take the oath on? And still you go on thinking that
you are not mixing religion with the government! You are mixing religion
with government.</p><p>And politicians are in a difficulty – I can understand. The American
Constitution was made by real, authentic lovers of humanity. But the
reward for such people is assassination.</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham Lincoln was assassinated – the only politician in the whole
world of whom it can be said that he was not political. His only fault
was that he was not political.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty percent of the American presidents have been assassinated; and
the American president has the most sophisticated security arrangements.
And in these twenty percent were the best American presidents. The
third-grade eighty percent nobody bothers about. Who bothers to
assassinate Ronald Reagan? Why waste a bullet? Nobody bothered about
Jimmy Carter.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know where Jimmy Carter is, and where his smile is? Both have
disappeared. In the last pictures of him I have seen there is no smile.
And what happened to Jimmy Carter? You will know only one day when he
dies. Then there will be in newspapers a small news item, that “Jimmy
Carter, ex-president of America, died.”</p><p><br></p><p>Who wants to kill people who don’t have any high ideals? To have high
ideals in your life is dangerous, because the world is full of retarded
people; they cannot tolerate you, your presence. Your very existence
makes them feel that they are retarded.</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham Lincoln had to be assassinated. The Kennedys, both the
brothers, had to be assassinated. Something beautiful could have come
out of those two Kennedys. The first Kennedy was a beautiful man –
young, fresh, available for new ideas. And the second Kennedy was even
more intelligent than the first.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange world. You destroy your best flowers, and you
preserve plants which never flower, never come to fruition.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a politician, I am not a religious leader. But Sheela, while
I was in isolation, had created a few things which have to be
withdrawn.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the book of RAJNEESHISM is not my writing, nor my discourses;
it was Sheela and her group’s creation, so it should not be printed
again. There is no thing like Rajneeshism – because then it becomes
again another Christianity, another communism, another Hinduism. I have
been fighting my whole life against all “isms,” and these people made an
“ism” out of me!</p><p><br></p><p>They created the word “Rajneeshee.” You have to drop that word;
otherwise, what is the difference between a Christian, a Jew and a
Rajneeshee? I want you to be yourself, not a Rajneeshee.</p><p><br></p><p>You love me – that does not mean that you have to become a
Rajneeshee. You can love me without becoming a Rajneeshee. And what
these Rajneeshees have done, this gang of twenty Rajneeshees, is enough
to condemn the word.</p><p><br></p><p>So now, there are no longer any Rajneeshees. You are individuals,
totally free individuals. Out of your freedom and love you are here.
There is no bondage, there is no contract. There is no surrender, there
is no faith.</p><p>And today I would like to declare something immensely important,
because I feel perhaps this helped Sheela and her people to exploit you.
I don’t know whether tomorrow I will be here or not, so it is better to
do it while I am here and make you free from any other possibility of
such a fascist regime.</p><p><br></p><p>That is, from today, you are free to use any color of clothes. If you
feel like using red clothes, that is up to you. And this message has to
be sent all over the world to all the communes. It will be more
beautiful to have all the colors. I had always dreamed of seeing you in
all the colors of the rainbow.</p><p><br></p><p>Today we claim the rainbow to be our colors.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: you return your malas – unless you wish otherwise.
That is your choice, but it is not a necessity anymore. You return your
malas to President Hasya. But if you want to keep it, it is up to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing: from now onwards, anybody who wants initiation into
sannyas will not be given a mala and will not be told to change to red
clothes – so we can take over the world more easily!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6 BELOVED MASTER, THANK YOU.</p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME I FEEL LIKE MEDITATING. I DON’T WANT TO BELIEVE IN
ANYTHING. I DON’T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING TO HOLD ONTO. I
JUST WANT TO EXPERIENCE YOUR SILENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THIS THE POINT?</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly!</p><p><br></p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

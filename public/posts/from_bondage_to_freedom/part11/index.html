UNTIL NOW, YOU WERE ANOTHER PROJECTION OF THE FATHER. A REAL MASTER IS NOT EVEN A MASTER. THIS TOTAL FREEDOM SCARES ME, AND I DON’T KNOW HOW TO LIVE IT. WHAT IS A REAL DISCIPLE? DOES HE EXIST? OR DOES HE BEGIN TO EXIST ONLY WHEN HE STARTS TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL?\nThe real master is only a presence. He has no intentions of being a master. His presence is his teaching. His love is his message. Every gesture of his hand is pointing to the moon. And this whole thing is not being done, it is a happening. The master is not a doer. He has learned the greatest secret of life: let-go.\nThe master has drowned his ego and the idea of separation from existence itself. He is no longer there as a separate entity, he is just a window. You can see through the window the infinite sky and the expanding universe: the sunrise, the sunset, a bird on the wing, the lotus opening its being, releasing its fragrance.\nThe master is certainly not one of the so-called masters you will find everywhere, pretending to be masters, posing as masters.\nThe master is just an immense emptiness.\n135\nAnd, naturally, the disciple is one who comes closer and closer to the same qualities: nonexistence of the ego; no separation from existence; an overflowing love, unconditional; a tremendous sensitivity to beauty... a great revolution – that you are not, existence is. The dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean.\nThe function of the master is to give you a taste of dissolving into the whole, of becoming part of this tremendously beautiful orchestra of existence. He has no creeds to teach you, no dogmas to preach to you, no catechism, no theologies. He is not to give you more slavery, more mental bondage.\nThat’s what all your so-called masters are doing. Somebody is making you a Christian, somebody is making you a Hindu, somebody is making you a Mohammedan. These are not masters. These are all phony, plastic, American – or better, Californian.\nThe authentic master is immense freedom.\nTo be close to him is to be close to the infinite sky, which knows no limits. To be in his presence is to be lost, utterly lost.\nJust now, you don’t exist. What exists is the silence that pervades five thousand people. You are melting in that silence.\nA master is not a pretender. He does not declare that he is a master, he proves it – just by his presence. The presence of the master is the only miracle in the whole existence. And it is tremendously magnetic. Whoever is courageous enough and wants to explore this silence, this stillness, comes closer to the master.\nComing closer to the master is what is meant by disciplehood. It is not a surrender, it is not a belief, it is not faith.\nIt is an adventure, the ultimate adventure – because as you come closer to the master, you strangely feel that you are disappearing. The moment you are really close to the master, you are not. Neither the master is, nor the disciple is.\nThen there is communion.\nThen there is that transfer which no word can manage to communicate.\nIn that immense silence between two utterly absent but fully alert beings, there transpires the most exquisite, ecstatic experience of life.\nYou have come back home. Question 2\nBELOVED MASTER,\nYOU TALKED OF SHIVA, WHO WAS INFATUATED SO MUCH WITH HIS WOMAN THAT WHEN SHE DIED HE CARRIED HER DEAD BODY ON HIS SHOULDER FOR TWELVE YEARS. IS IT THE SAME SHIVA WHO WAS KNOWN AS THE ENLIGHTENED ONE, WHO GAVE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE TECHNIQUES FOR ENLIGHTENMENT? CAN THERE BE ANY POSITIVE MEANING OF CARRYING THE DEAD BODY TOO?\nYes, there is great meaning. And it is the same Shiva who has given one hundred and twelve methods of meditation to the world.\nIt is very rare that a man exhausts the whole of science single-handedly. Shiva is one of those geniuses. As far as meditation is concerned, in these thousands of years nothing has been added to those one hundred and twelve methods. They are exhaustive.\nShiva has taken note of every possibility. He has not left any corner, any space, any dimension in which you can discover a new method. Certainly no other genius in the whole humanity can be compared to this strange man.\nBut the story must be confusing you. His wife, Parvati, dies; he loved her immensely. I would like to go step by step into the story and to explain all the implications of it. They mean much to you and to humanity today.\nFirst, Shiva was not celibate. And a man who was not celibate discovered all the techniques of meditation. What is the implication?\nThe implication is that celibacy has nothing to do with meditation – that in fact the so-called celibate saints and monks have not contributed anything to human wisdom, human intelligence, to beauty, to richness, to music, to dance. No, not in any dimension have your celibate monks and nuns been contributors. They have been a burden on the earth. The only thing they have contributed is AIDS. And it is a very natural consequence.\nLife arises out of sex, life consists of sex. You can grow your sex to such a refinement that it can become love, it can become compassion. But if you block the very energy of sex by celibacy, you have destroyed all possibilities of your growth. You are now moving towards death. If sex is life, then celibacy is death. This is a simple logic.\nAnd AIDS is another name of slow death. That’s why there is no cure for it, because there is no cure for death. The only difference is, death comes suddenly; AIDS comes slowly, takes time. But to die suddenly has a beauty. One moment you are alive, next moment you are gone; there is no intermediate period where you are in torture.\nBut a man who has to live for two years waiting for death – you cannot conceive his torture. He knows there is no way to avoid it. All his life loses meaning; he is simply waiting in immense anguish. And two years for him are not just two years. Time is relative. If you are happy, time goes fast. If you are meeting your beloved, you cannot believe that the night is over and on the horizon the sun is rising. If you are meeting a friend after many years, hours pass – it seems suddenly time is running, not walking in the normal way.\nBut when you are just in despair, anguish, and there is nothing tomorrow except death, those two years are almost infinite. To us, from the outside, they are two years; but for the person who is in the grip of AIDS, those two years are eternity.\nThese celibates have given AIDS to you, because celibacy is unnatural, against biology, against physiology, against your hormones.\nAnd remember perfectly well that your body is autonomous. It does not work on your orders; it has its own program and it works accordingly. You eat food. It is up to you what to eat, but once it is below your throat it is beyond your capacity to do anything about it. Now it is in the power of your body to digest it, to separate it into different elements, to send those different elements to different parts of the body.\nWhat is needed for the brain will be carried to the brain. What is needed for your genitalia will be carried to your genitalia. And your body does not know that you are a Christian monk, that you are celibate – it goes on creating male sperm in you. What are you going to do with those male sperm?\nYou cannot keep on containing them within you, because there is only a small space; once it is full, they have to be released. And they are in a hurry to be released, because they also want to go into the world and see what is happening outside. That’s how you have come into the world, that’s how everybody else has come into the world.\nIt is good that Gautam Buddha’s father was not a monk. Just a few people: Gautam Buddha’s father, Lao Tzu’s father, Chuang Tzu’s father, Moses’ father – if all these people were monks, there would have been no religions, except Christianity... because the poor father of Jesus had nothing to do with Jesus’ birth – he was a monk!\nBut have you ever thought about it, that the Christian God is a trinity, and that one part of the Christian trinity is the Holy Ghost. He is not a celibate, he is a rapist.\nA great divine act! – he rapes a poor carpenter’s virgin wife, and you still go on calling this monster the Holy Ghost. Then what do you think an unholy ghost is? And he is an essential part of God. That makes God also a noncelibate.\nBut your monks, your nuns, all the religions have forced death on humanity, destructiveness on humanity. And the ultimate result is AIDS. And AIDS is more dangerous than nuclear weapons, because nuclear weapons are not going to be used at all. It is absolutely clear that to use those weapons is to destroy all life on the planet.\nWar has meaning when somebody is victorious and somebody is defeated. War has no meaning when the whole of humanity is destroyed. Nobody is victorious; nobody is defeated. I can say to you with absolute certainty, nuclear weapons cannot be used. But AIDS is spreading fast, like wildfire. It may destroy humanity.\nThe first implication in Shiva’s story is that he is not celibate. The second implication is that he is not a homosexual. All your monks and nuns are bound to be homosexuals, lesbians. You have forced them into such a place that there is no other way.\nThe third implication is that Shiva has infinite love for his beloved, so much that he carried Parvati’s dead body in search of a physician for twelve years around the country, till all the limbs, one by one, fell away. Nothing was left on his shoulder. It looks a little ridiculous, but to me it has a totally different meaning.\nA meditator like Shiva knows life is eternal. And if life is eternal, then there is no reason why Parvati has to take another form. She is still young, healthy, beautiful. There must be someone who can manage to make her heart beat again, her lungs function again, because behind the body is the soul, which is eternal – just something in the body is missing.\nIn that way, Shiva proves to be the first pioneer in human engineering. He is searching for a physician to change any part that is preventing the soul of his wife from entering this beautiful body.\nNow scientists say that the human body has the capacity of rejuvenating itself as long as you want. Why do people almost always die at the age of seventy, on average? The reason is not physical, the reason is psychological.\nWe have become accustomed to the idea that life is only for seventy years. This conditioning in the mind for a life of seventy years is the cause of your body stopping; otherwise there is no reason.\nThere are places in Kashmir, a small part which is now occupied by Pakistan, where there are people who are one hundred and forty years old, one hundred and fifty years old – and still young. I have been to see those people. They live in the hills, and somehow they have not got the idea that man’s life is only for seventy years.\nIn the Caucasus, in Russia, there are people who have reached one hundred and eighty years, thousands of people, who are still working in the fields like young men. They are robust.…\nI am reminded of George Bernard Shaw, who lived all his life in London. But, when he was coming close to the age of seventy, he started going around in small villages to visit the cemeteries. His friends thought that he had become crazy.\nThey always had known that something was wrong with Bernard Shaw, but now it was perfectly proved that this man was going crazy. What is the point of going into small villages and visiting cemeteries, and reading the inscriptions in the cemeteries, and collecting notes?\nFinally he decided to change his residence from London to a small village. His friends asked, “What is the reason? You are a man of literature, of culture; London is your milieu. What are you going to do in that stupid village?”\nHe said, “That is the only village I am going to live in, because in that village cemetery I have found that people have lived one hundred and ten years, one hundred and twenty years, one hundred and thirty years. And still the inscription is that the man died untimely. One hundred and thirty years, and the man died untimely!\n“That village has the right psychology. I am going to that village, and I am going to visit the cemetery every day. Now that is my university, and I have to read those inscriptions on the graves to convince myself that seventy is not the end.” And he lived almost one century.\nNow the people who are working on human engineering say that man can easily live for three hundred years, without any difficulty and without any old age. Just his psychology has to be changed, his conditioning has to be changed. And there are more daring scientists who say that if we can change the program in the basic human cells – which can be done, now we are capable of doing it – then we can make man live as long as he wants.\nOne of my sannyasins here has written a letter to me that he is very confused. He is a scientist, and he works in a scientific lab where artificial human organs are made – hands, legs, liver, heart – all human parts. His confusion is “whether I am going against nature, because the factory-produced heart is not as good as the natural heart. Am I doing something wrong by being in this profession, by creating artificial hands?”\nHis confusion is absolutely unfounded. Remember, nature has given you intelligence, and the function of intelligence is to improve upon nature. It is just the beginning.\nIf your artificial limbs are not so good as the natural ones, don’t be worried: within a few years your artificial limbs will be better than the natural ones, because natural limbs are created by blind biology and your limbs will be created by conscious intelligence. And that conscious intelligence is part of nature, so you are not doing anything against nature.\nYes, those who are preaching celibacy are against nature. Those who are preaching against birth control methods are against nature. Those who are making nuclear bombs are against nature. They are all destructive – your work is creative. If your limbs are not yet superior to natural limbs, make more effort, put in more energy. It is just a question of bringing more intelligence into your work.\nAnd it will be a tremendous blessing to humanity if you can create superior parts for the human body, because when somebody dies of a heart attack – life never dies – only his heart has failed; if it can be replaced, he will be again alive. You are in the service of life.\nSomebody has a fracture: now, rather than joining the fractured bone, which will never be as strong as it was before, it is better to change the whole bone completely for a new, artificial and better bone. We can make bones which cannot have such accidents.\nWe can make man capable of changing anything that is not functioning well. There is no need for glasses if eyes can be changed. And there will be real beauty – at the age of seventy, having fresh eyes like a child!\nThere is no need to feel confused. You are to remember only one single criterion: anything in the service of life is in the service of nature; anything against life is against nature.\nAnd intelligence is nature’s only hope to improve upon itself.\nShiva’s story has beautiful implications. In carrying his dead wife, he is saying that perhaps there may be someone who can change some small part which has gone out of function. He is the first scientist of human engineering.\nThird, his love – don’t call it infatuation – his love for his wife simply shows that meditativeness is not against love. A man who created all the methods of meditation, who was perhaps history’s greatest meditator, was still human and had no difficulty in being in love.\nAll the religions have been teaching just the opposite. They are teaching that you renounce your wife, you renounce your children, you renounce the world, you renounce comforts, you renounce everything that makes your life a joy. Then only can you be saved. They are teaching you suicide; it is not religion. But they have turned millions of people into a gang of suicidal people.\nThe moment your love dies, many other things also die in you. A man whose love is dead is incapable of seeing beauty in a painting. If he cannot see beauty in a human face, in the face of Cleopatra; if he cannot see beauty in the ultimate expression of existence, what can he see on a canvas? Just a few colors. He cannot see beauty in it.\nHe whose love is dead cannot compose poetry, because without love his poetry will be simply juiceless. It won’t have life in it. It will be a simple gymnastics of words without any spirit behind it. It will be a corpse of poetry, but not poetry.\nA man who cannot love cannot be creative in any sense. Why should he make a beautiful statue of a woman or a man? Why should he make beautiful statues of women in Khajuraho in India?\nI am aware of all the best sculptures around the world: nothing is comparable to Khajuraho. Thousands of beautiful women in one temple... and there are thirty temples still in perfect shape. There used to be one hundred temples. Seventy temples are in ruins, but in those ruins also you can find beautiful pieces.\nIn one temple, thousands of women, men, loving each other, hugging each otherYou can see\nthat the stones have become alive, you can see that the stones can speak. You can see that nature has not been able to create such beautiful women as those unknown artists have done.\nBut if stone can be made so beautiful, so alive that it seems the woman is just going to come out, that she is just going to start breathing again, then why can’t we improve on humanity? There is no need for ugly people. It is our fault and our responsibility.\nNow the medical profession is capable of deciding what kind of child it will be that you are going to produce, because the male sperm has the whole program, the woman’s egg has the whole program. Both programs can be read, and if it is not worthwhile to go on, they should be discarded.\nWe have to discard many old conceptions – that your child has to be your child. But if your child is going to be blind, if your child is going to be crippled, if your child is going to be just an imbecile, do you still want it to be your child?\nWill it not be better that people go to the hospitals and donate male sperm, that women go to the hospitals when they want children? The couple can go and say, “This is the kind of child we want, so you figure it out. This is my wife, so you read her eggs” – and every month a woman is releasing one egg, so there is no trouble – “and you give her the best sperm from your lab. I want my child to be a genius. I want my child to be healthy. I want my child to live long.”\nYou have to drop that stupid idea that it has to be just your sperm. Can you recognize your sperm? If twelve samples are placed before you, can you recognize it, that “this is my sperm”? So what is the point? Why make a fuss about it? Get the best sperm that is possible. Think of the child and his future – give him all that is best.\nBut the most sorry thing isWe are doing this with trees, with animals – and we have improved\nupon animals, upon trees.\nI had one gardenerI have lived in many cities, but wherever I have lived, I have lived surrounded\nwith trees. My gardens are almost jungles. This old gardener was really a genius. He was winning the first prize in the state every year for producing the biggest flowers, and he wanted to do it in my garden.\nI asked, “What is your secret? How do you manage to create the biggest rose in the whole state?”\nHe said, “The secret is simple. I don’t allow many flowers to grow on one rosebush. I cut all the buds and keep only one bud. Naturally, all the juice of the tree moves into one bud. Instead of creating hundreds of roseflowers, it creates one roseflower, but then nobody can compete with it.”\nIf this is possible, then rather than having a dozen children it is better to have one child, but have a child which will have the best intelligence, the best body, the most beautiful face. But no, people are interested in having dozens of children. They are exhausted, their children are born almost exhausted; from the very beginning they are old.\nWhat we are doing in nature with trees, with animals, we have not yet been courageous enough to do with human beings; otherwise, there is no need for crippled people. It is sad; they are victims of your stupid ideas. They are suffering because of their parents. There are blind children, there are deaf children. There are children who are sick from the very beginning.\nIn Tibet, it used to be a traditional thing that whenever a child was born they would dip the child in freezing, ice-cold water nine times. Out of ten children, nine would die.\nLooks inhuman, primitive – but the basic principle is understandable. Their idea was this: that if these children cannot survive the shock of freezing water, then in Tibet – which is the land of eternal snows all around – their whole life will be a misery. “Now one has survived; we can depend on his strength, his stamina – that he will be able to live in this remote corner of the world; the very roof of the world.” And Tibetans are really strong, very strong people. But the reason is because nine have been sacrificed.\nI am not telling you to sacrifice your children – just don’t produce them.\nShiva’s story makes it clear that a man of meditation will be a man of immense love. He will not be inhuman.\nFor example, Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, would not allow any woman to come close to him. Women had to be eight feet away from him. What kind of fear? Jaina monks are not allowed to sit\non a spot where a woman has been sitting before, because that spot still has a feminine vibe. These people seem to be insane.\nNine months they were in their mother’s womb – nine months’ continuous feminine vibe! And half of their being is contributed by the mother; their flesh, their blood, their skin, their bones are all contributed by their mother – they all have a feminine vibe. And these idiots are saying, “Don’t sit in a place where a woman was sitting.”\nSo every Jaina monk carries a small mattress, rolled up, with him. So, wherever he sits, first he puts his mattress as a protection, and then he sits on the mattress. If feminine vibes are really so powerful, I think a mattress cannot prevent them. In fact, the mattress itself is feminine. Have you seen a male mattress?\nBuddha told his disciples, “You have, while walking, to keep your eyes only four feet ahead, looking down on the earth just four feet ahead, so that you never see a feminine face. At the most you can see the feet of a woman, and if you see the feet, move away.”\nWhat kind of fear...? And these people are meditative? This is paranoia! They must be tremendously repressed. These are psychologically sick people, they are sexually pathological.\nBuddha had said, “Never touch a woman, never talk to a woman.” Women are half of humanity! This is simply a male chauvinistic attitude, absolutely macho.\nAnd it is not based on the transformation of man through meditation, but on repression of sexuality; that’s why these people are so fearful.\nNot to touch a woman – I don’t see the point. My people are here... they are hugging women, touching women, and I don’t see that their spirituality is destroyed, or their meditation is disturbed. In fact, just the opposite is the case.\nThere is a question... a man has said, “It is very strange that when I make love to a woman, the next day I understand you better. My meditation goes deeper.”\nHe is feeling strange. There is nothing strange in it, it is how it should be. Making love to a woman relaxes you, takes your tensions away, makes you more childlike. Naturally you understand me better, naturally you meditate deeper.\nMan and woman can help each other tremendously towards meditation and towards the ultimate transformation of their being.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nHOW CAN THE COMMON MAN RISE ABOVE ALL THE POWER TRIPS OF THOSE IN POWER, AND TRULY BUILD A WORLD OF THE HEART, OF LOVE, AND OF CARING? IS SUCH A WORLD REALLY POSSIBLE, OR SHOULD I JUST CONTINUE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE AWARENESS, BLISS, JOY AND GRATEFULNESS THAT HAS COME INTO MY LIFE SINCE FINDING YOU? PLEASE COMMENT.\nThe only way to prevent people from getting power-oriented is to start with yourself, because everybody carries in his unconscious the desire for power of some kind or other.\nOne of the great emperors of India, Shah Jehan – who made the most beautiful grave for his wife, the Taj Mahal – was arrested by his own son, imprisoned, and the son became the emperor. His\nname was Aurangzeb; he was one of the worst emperors India has known. But sometimes even third-rate human beings have certain insights which are significant.\nAurangzeb told his court, “My father has sent a message from the prison that the whole day sitting there he feels bored. It will be a tremendous kindness if he can be given thirty children whom he can teach.” Aurangzeb commented, “This is nothing but lust for power. He has lost his kingdom, but he still wants thirty children so that he can rule over them, discipline them.”\nThere is insight in the comment. The people who become teachers, the people who become preachers, the people who become politicians, all are searching for power in different ways. Even your God is not much different. How can he be much different? – because he is your creation, he is your projection. He has all the ingredients of your mind.\nGod does not exist anywhere. You paint him.\nI have heard.… One small child was making a picture, very fast. His father watched and asked, “What are you doing so quickly?”\nThe boy said, “I am making a picture of God the father.”\nHis father said, “But how can you make a picture of God? You have not seen him, nobody has seen him.”\nThe boy said, “Don’t be worried: when my picture is complete, everybody will know how God looks!” All your gods are nothing but the pictures of that child.\nGod punished Adam and Eve – for what? Disobedience. This is lust for power; otherwise, a God who is love will be able to forgive. But he drove them out of the Garden of Eden and made them feel guilty that they have disobeyed.\nBut couldn’t he explain to them? Couldn’t he give them another chance? – even ordinary human fathers will not drive their children out of the house because they have disobeyed. We expect a little more compassion from God. And what was their disobedience? They had just eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge. I don’t think there is anything wrong in it. Knowledge is not a sin. In fact, God making knowledge a sin is behaving really insanely.\nHe has prohibited them from eating the fruit of eternal life. What kind of father, what kind of God is he? In fact, he should have told them, “These are the two best trees in the whole Garden of Eden, so eat as many apples as possible.” Strange, the apple tree is the tree of knowledge! “And eat as many fruits of the tree of eternal life” – then certainly they would not have disobeyed.\nIf anybody is criminal in this whole act it is God, not Adam and Eve. And Adam and Eve did not rebel. In fact, they should have driven God out of Eden, thrown him out of the garden, told him, “You are no longer needed, you are out of date. Get lost! Now we are here and we will manage!” But they must have been very simple people, innocent. God drove them out in a third-class Ford motorcar.\nAnd they accepted the guilt, and Christians are still living in that guilt. Six thousand years have passed, but every Christian is born in sin. This is God’s lust for power. And the priest found it perfectly suitable to his own lust for power. He is perfectly in tune with God. He makes you feel guilty, he makes you feel a sinner – that gives him power over you.\nJust a few days ago the Catholic pope informed all the Catholics in the world that they cannot confess their sins to God direct. Why not directly? It is now a sin to confess directly to God! They have to confess to the priest; everything has to go via the right channel. This is all lust for power. If people start confessing to God, then the priest is useless – and finally the pope is useless.\nAnd Catholics confessing their sins to the priest don’t understand the conspiracy that the power- lusty people are imposing on them. They are told that if they confess to the priest, God will forgive them. So they confess, but that makes them more and more enslaved by the priest, because the priest knows everything about their sins, crimesThey cannot leave the Catholic fold; they know\nthe priest knows too much about them. Now they are in the hands of the priest. This is a simple political strategy.\nI know about Indira Gandhi in India. She was very much interested in my ideas – we had a few meetings. She told me, “My power consists in having a few files.”\nI said, “I don’t understand. What do you mean?”\nShe said, “I have files against each politician who can be a competitor to me, and he knows that I will immediately expose him before the public, before the court. Rather than becoming the prime minister, he will be behind bars.”\nThose files now are in the hands of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi was never in politics, but those files are enough: all old politicians are silent, knowing perfectly well that they can be caught and exposed. They have committed every kind of crime.\nYou will be surprised... when Indira Gandhi’s son, Sanjay Gandhi, had an accident and died – his plane crashed just near Indira Gandhi’s house, two blocks away – Indira Gandhi rushed there immediately. Naturally, you would think a mother would rush immediately; her son has died. But what she inquired was, “He had some keys with him – where are those keys?” She had not rushed there for Sanjay Gandhi, she had rushed there for those two keys, because those two keys were to all the files containing all the papers against all the Indian politicians.\nIn fact, it seems she felt relieved by Sanjay Gandhi’s death, because Sanjay Gandhi was harassing her. It is a well-known fact all over the country – there are eyewitnesses – that once Sanjay Gandhi slapped Indira Gandhi. And it was an everyday thing, they were fighting continuously, because he wanted all those files. Finally, just to keep the peace, she had given him the keys. His death came as a relief; the keys were back with her.\nYou are asking me, “How can we stop people from getting into a power trip?”\nStart from yourself. Just don’t do anything to dominate, and don’t allow anybody to dominate you either. Take the whole responsibility of being an individual, and respect the right of everybody else\nto be an individual, to be totally free. Never interfere in anybody’s life, and never allow anybody else to interfere in your life.\nAnd be watchful, because the ego is very subtle, its ways are very subtle. Watch that you are not trying to be powerful in some way – over your wife, over your children, over your servants.…\nDo you treat your servant exactly the same way as you treat your boss? If not, then you cannot get rid of the power trip. Respect everybody: the boss is doing his work, the servant is doing his work.\nBut as it happens now, the servant passes through the room and you don’t even look at him, you don’t even say, “Hi.” The servant is just a servant – not to be taken any note of. But if the boss comes in the room then you stand up, trembling, nervous. What has happened? Your servant is as much a human being as your boss. Behave with them equally, be respectful to each individual. What their function is, is secondary.\nThat is the whole point in this commune. Somebody is a cleaner, somebody is a psychotherapist – but in the commune there is no difference at all. The psychotherapist is not being treated specially, and the cleaner is not thought to be doing something third rate.\nAfter the functions, in the evening, you will see that the professor, the president, the cleaner – they are all hugging, and they are all dancing in the disco. This is how things should be. Everybody is contributing to the commune. Everything is absolutely necessary. In fact, we can live without the professor, but we cannot live without the cleaner – his function is far more important.\nIf you just keep a little alert that you are not dominating anybody in any wayEven small children\nthat have unfortunately fallen into your hands, be respectful to them. That will teach them also to be respectful to everybody. And that will give them an integrity, individuality, a certain kind of crystallization, a great spiritual strength. And then they will never seek power.\nPower is sought only by people who are feeling deep inside an inferiority complex. So don’t create an inferiority complex in anybody, and don’t feel yourself in any way inferior.\nAll human beings are unique. I cannot say they are equal. That is my basic point against communism. Communism is absolutely an unpsychological philosophy. No two human beings are equal. Yes, every human being is unique. There is no need for equality; what is needed is uniqueness.\nTry to express your uniqueness, and help others to express their uniqueness. And destroy the inferiority complex first in yourself, then in your wife, then in your children, then in your neighbors, in your friends. And let this fire spread.\nI can see a day somewhere in the future that people will be there but there will be nobody who is hungry for power. To be hungry for power simply shows that the man needs psychiatric treatment. All the politicians of the world, all the presidents, all the prime ministers, kings and queens, need psychiatric treatment so that they can again become human beings.\nThat atmosphere can be created. We have one million sannyasins around the world: create that atmosphere, spread that idea to every nook and corner of the earth.\nWe have lived under these power trippers for thousands of years and, except for suffering and misery, nothing has happened.\nI am showing you the way where there is a possibility of a song bursting out of your heart and a dance, for no reason at all – just for dance’s sake. It is so joyful to dance with the wind, in the sun, just the way trees are dancing.\nHumanity has not yet become cultured. Civilization has not yet happened.\nWe have to create the ground for it to happen – and we are going to create it!

UNTIL NOW, YOU WERE ANOTHER
PROJECTION OF THE FATHER. A REAL MASTER IS NOT EVEN A MASTER. THIS TOTAL
FREEDOM SCARES ME, AND I DON’T KNOW HOW TO LIVE IT. WHAT IS A REAL
DISCIPLE? DOES HE EXIST? OR DOES HE BEGIN TO EXIST ONLY WHEN HE STARTS
TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL?</p><p><br></p><p>The real master is only a presence. He has no intentions of being a
master. His presence is his teaching. His love is his message. Every
gesture of his hand is pointing to the moon. And this whole thing is not
being done, it is a happening. The master is not a doer. He has learned
the greatest secret of life: let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>The master has drowned his ego and the idea of separation from
existence itself. He is no longer there as a separate entity, he is just
a window. You can see through the window the infinite sky and the
expanding universe: the sunrise, the sunset, a bird on the wing, the
lotus opening its being, releasing its fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is certainly not one of the so-called masters you will
find everywhere, pretending to be masters, posing as masters.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is just an immense emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>135</p><p>And, naturally, the disciple is one who comes closer and closer to
the same qualities: nonexistence of the ego; no separation from
existence; an overflowing love, unconditional; a tremendous sensitivity
to beauty... a great revolution – that you are not, existence is. The
dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the master is to give you a taste of dissolving into
the whole, of becoming part of this tremendously beautiful orchestra of
existence. He has no creeds to teach you, no dogmas to preach to you, no
catechism, no theologies. He is not to give you more slavery, more
mental bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what all your so-called masters are doing. Somebody is making
you a Christian, somebody is making you a Hindu, somebody is making you
a Mohammedan. These are not masters. These are all phony, plastic,
American – or better, Californian.</p><p><br></p><p>The authentic master is immense freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>To be close to him is to be close to the infinite sky, which knows no
limits. To be in his presence is to be lost, utterly lost.</p><p>Just now, you don’t exist. What exists is the silence that pervades
five thousand people. You are melting in that silence.</p><p><br></p><p>A master is not a pretender. He does not declare that he is a master,
he proves it – just by his presence. The presence of the master is the
only miracle in the whole existence. And it is tremendously magnetic.
Whoever is courageous enough and wants to explore this silence, this
stillness, comes closer to the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming closer to the master is what is meant by disciplehood. It is
not a surrender, it is not a belief, it is not faith.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an adventure, the ultimate adventure – because as you come
closer to the master, you strangely feel that you are disappearing. The
moment you are really close to the master, you are not. Neither the
master is, nor the disciple is.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is communion.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is that transfer which no word can manage to
communicate.</p><p><br></p><p>In that immense silence between two utterly absent but fully alert
beings, there transpires the most exquisite, ecstatic experience of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>You have come back home. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>YOU TALKED OF SHIVA, WHO WAS INFATUATED SO MUCH WITH HIS WOMAN THAT
WHEN SHE DIED HE CARRIED HER DEAD BODY ON HIS SHOULDER FOR TWELVE YEARS.
IS IT THE SAME SHIVA WHO WAS KNOWN AS THE ENLIGHTENED ONE, WHO GAVE ONE
HUNDRED AND TWELVE TECHNIQUES FOR ENLIGHTENMENT? CAN THERE BE ANY
POSITIVE MEANING OF CARRYING THE DEAD BODY TOO?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there is great meaning. And it is the same Shiva who has given
one hundred and twelve methods of meditation to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very rare that a man exhausts the whole of science
single-handedly. Shiva is one of those geniuses. As far as meditation is
concerned, in these thousands of years nothing has been added to those
one hundred and twelve methods. They are exhaustive.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva has taken note of every possibility. He has not left any
corner, any space, any dimension in which you can discover a new method.
Certainly no other genius in the whole humanity can be compared to this
strange man.</p><p><br></p><p>But the story must be confusing you. His wife, Parvati, dies; he
loved her immensely. I would like to go step by step into the story and
to explain all the implications of it. They mean much to you and to
humanity today.</p><p><br></p><p>First, Shiva was not celibate. And a man who was not celibate
discovered all the techniques of meditation. What is the
implication?</p><p><br></p><p>The implication is that celibacy has nothing to do with meditation –
that in fact the so-called celibate saints and monks have not
contributed anything to human wisdom, human intelligence, to beauty, to
richness, to music, to dance. No, not in any dimension have your
celibate monks and nuns been contributors. They have been a burden on
the earth. The only thing they have contributed is AIDS. And it is a
very natural consequence.</p><p><br></p><p>Life arises out of sex, life consists of sex. You can grow your sex
to such a refinement that it can become love, it can become compassion.
But if you block the very energy of sex by celibacy, you have destroyed
all possibilities of your growth. You are now moving towards death. If
sex is life, then celibacy is death. This is a simple logic.</p><p><br></p><p>And AIDS is another name of slow death. That’s why there is no cure
for it, because there is no cure for death. The only difference is,
death comes suddenly; AIDS comes slowly, takes time. But to die suddenly
has a beauty. One moment you are alive, next moment you are gone; there
is no intermediate period where you are in torture.</p><p><br></p><p>But a man who has to live for two years waiting for death – you
cannot conceive his torture. He knows there is no way to avoid it. All
his life loses meaning; he is simply waiting in immense anguish. And two
years for him are not just two years. Time is relative. If you are
happy, time goes fast. If you are meeting your beloved, you cannot
believe that the night is over and on the horizon the sun is rising. If
you are meeting a friend after many years, hours pass – it seems
suddenly time is running, not walking in the normal way.</p><p>But when you are just in despair, anguish, and there is nothing
tomorrow except death, those two years are almost infinite. To us, from
the outside, they are two years; but for the person who is in the grip
of AIDS, those two years are eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>These celibates have given AIDS to you, because celibacy is
unnatural, against biology, against physiology, against your
hormones.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember perfectly well that your body is autonomous. It does not
work on your orders; it has its own program and it works accordingly.
You eat food. It is up to you what to eat, but once it is below your
throat it is beyond your capacity to do anything about it. Now it is in
the power of your body to digest it, to separate it into different
elements, to send those different elements to different parts of the
body.</p><p><br></p><p>What is needed for the brain will be carried to the brain. What is
needed for your genitalia will be carried to your genitalia. And your
body does not know that you are a Christian monk, that you are celibate
– it goes on creating male sperm in you. What are you going to do with
those male sperm?</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot keep on containing them within you, because there is only
a small space; once it is full, they have to be released. And they are
in a hurry to be released, because they also want to go into the world
and see what is happening outside. That’s how you have come into the
world, that’s how everybody else has come into the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that Gautam Buddha’s father was not a monk. Just a few
people: Gautam Buddha’s father, Lao Tzu’s father, Chuang Tzu’s father,
Moses’ father – if all these people were monks, there would have been no
religions, except Christianity... because the poor father of Jesus had
nothing to do with Jesus’ birth – he was a monk!</p><p><br></p><p>But have you ever thought about it, that the Christian God is a
trinity, and that one part of the Christian trinity is the Holy Ghost.
He is not a celibate, he is a rapist.</p><p><br></p><p>A great divine act! – he rapes a poor carpenter’s virgin wife, and
you still go on calling this monster the Holy Ghost. Then what do you
think an unholy ghost is? And he is an essential part of God. That makes
God also a noncelibate.</p><p><br></p><p>But your monks, your nuns, all the religions have forced death on
humanity, destructiveness on humanity. And the ultimate result is AIDS.
And AIDS is more dangerous than nuclear weapons, because nuclear weapons
are not going to be used at all. It is absolutely clear that to use
those weapons is to destroy all life on the planet.</p><p><br></p><p>War has meaning when somebody is victorious and somebody is defeated.
War has no meaning when the whole of humanity is destroyed. Nobody is
victorious; nobody is defeated. I can say to you with absolute
certainty, nuclear weapons cannot be used. But AIDS is spreading fast,
like wildfire. It may destroy humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>The first implication in Shiva’s story is that he is not celibate.
The second implication is that he is not a homosexual. All your monks
and nuns are bound to be homosexuals, lesbians. You have forced them
into such a place that there is no other way.</p><p>The third implication is that Shiva has infinite love for his
beloved, so much that he carried Parvati’s dead body in search of a
physician for twelve years around the country, till all the limbs, one
by one, fell away. Nothing was left on his shoulder. It looks a little
ridiculous, but to me it has a totally different meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>A meditator like Shiva knows life is eternal. And if life is eternal,
then there is no reason why Parvati has to take another form. She is
still young, healthy, beautiful. There must be someone who can manage to
make her heart beat again, her lungs function again, because behind the
body is the soul, which is eternal – just something in the body is
missing.</p><p><br></p><p>In that way, Shiva proves to be the first pioneer in human
engineering. He is searching for a physician to change any part that is
preventing the soul of his wife from entering this beautiful body.</p><p><br></p><p>Now scientists say that the human body has the capacity of
rejuvenating itself as long as you want. Why do people almost always die
at the age of seventy, on average? The reason is not physical, the
reason is psychological.</p><p><br></p><p>We have become accustomed to the idea that life is only for seventy
years. This conditioning in the mind for a life of seventy years is the
cause of your body stopping; otherwise there is no reason.</p><p><br></p><p>There are places in Kashmir, a small part which is now occupied by
Pakistan, where there are people who are one hundred and forty years
old, one hundred and fifty years old – and still young. I have been to
see those people. They live in the hills, and somehow they have not got
the idea that man’s life is only for seventy years.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Caucasus, in Russia, there are people who have reached one
hundred and eighty years, thousands of people, who are still working in
the fields like young men. They are robust.…</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of George Bernard Shaw, who lived all his life in
London. But, when he was coming close to the age of seventy, he started
going around in small villages to visit the cemeteries. His friends
thought that he had become crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>They always had known that something was wrong with Bernard Shaw, but
now it was perfectly proved that this man was going crazy. What is the
point of going into small villages and visiting cemeteries, and reading
the inscriptions in the cemeteries, and collecting notes?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he decided to change his residence from London to a small
village. His friends asked, “What is the reason? You are a man of
literature, of culture; London is your milieu. What are you going to do
in that stupid village?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is the only village I am going to live in, because in
that village cemetery I have found that people have lived one hundred
and ten years, one hundred and twenty years, one hundred and thirty
years. And still the inscription is that the man died untimely. One
hundred and thirty years, and the man died untimely!</p><p><br></p><p>“That village has the right psychology. I am going to that village,
and I am going to visit the cemetery every day. Now that is my
university, and I have to read those inscriptions on the graves to
convince myself that seventy is not the end.” And he lived almost one
century.</p><p>Now the people who are working on human engineering say that man can
easily live for three hundred years, without any difficulty and without
any old age. Just his psychology has to be changed, his conditioning has
to be changed. And there are more daring scientists who say that if we
can change the program in the basic human cells – which can be done, now
we are capable of doing it – then we can make man live as long as he
wants.</p><p>One of my sannyasins here has written a letter to me that he is very
confused. He is a scientist, and he works in a scientific lab where
artificial human organs are made – hands, legs, liver, heart – all human
parts. His confusion is “whether I am going against nature, because the
factory-produced heart is not as good as the natural heart. Am I doing
something wrong by being in this profession, by creating artificial
hands?”</p><p>His confusion is absolutely unfounded. Remember, nature has given you
intelligence, and the function of intelligence is to improve upon
nature. It is just the beginning.</p><p>If your artificial limbs are not so good as the natural ones, don’t
be worried: within a few years your artificial limbs will be better than
the natural ones, because natural limbs are created by blind biology and
your limbs will be created by conscious intelligence. And that conscious
intelligence is part of nature, so you are not doing anything against
nature.</p><p>Yes, those who are preaching celibacy are against nature. Those who
are preaching against birth control methods are against nature. Those
who are making nuclear bombs are against nature. They are all
destructive – your work is creative. If your limbs are not yet superior
to natural limbs, make more effort, put in more energy. It is just a
question of bringing more intelligence into your work.</p><p>And it will be a tremendous blessing to humanity if you can create
superior parts for the human body, because when somebody dies of a heart
attack – life never dies – only his heart has failed; if it can be
replaced, he will be again alive. You are in the service of life.</p><p>Somebody has a fracture: now, rather than joining the fractured bone,
which will never be as strong as it was before, it is better to change
the whole bone completely for a new, artificial and better bone. We can
make bones which cannot have such accidents.</p><p>We can make man capable of changing anything that is not functioning
well. There is no need for glasses if eyes can be changed. And there
will be real beauty – at the age of seventy, having fresh eyes like a
child!</p><p>There is no need to feel confused. You are to remember only one
single criterion: anything in the service of life is in the service of
nature; anything against life is against nature.</p><p>And intelligence is nature’s only hope to improve upon itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva’s story has beautiful implications. In carrying his dead wife,
he is saying that perhaps there may be someone who can change some small
part which has gone out of function. He is the first scientist of human
engineering.</p><p>Third, his love – don’t call it infatuation – his love for his wife
simply shows that meditativeness is not against love. A man who created
all the methods of meditation, who was perhaps history’s greatest
meditator, was still human and had no difficulty in being in love.</p><p>All the religions have been teaching just the opposite. They are
teaching that you renounce your wife, you renounce your children, you
renounce the world, you renounce comforts, you renounce everything that
makes your life a joy. Then only can you be saved. They are teaching you
suicide; it is not religion. But they have turned millions of people
into a gang of suicidal people.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment your love dies, many other things also die in you. A man
whose love is dead is incapable of seeing beauty in a painting. If he
cannot see beauty in a human face, in the face of Cleopatra; if he
cannot see beauty in the ultimate expression of existence, what can he
see on a canvas? Just a few colors. He cannot see beauty in it.</p><p><br></p><p>He whose love is dead cannot compose poetry, because without love his
poetry will be simply juiceless. It won’t have life in it. It will be a
simple gymnastics of words without any spirit behind it. It will be a
corpse of poetry, but not poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who cannot love cannot be creative in any sense. Why should he
make a beautiful statue of a woman or a man? Why should he make
beautiful statues of women in Khajuraho in India?</p><p><br></p><p>I am aware of all the best sculptures around the world: nothing is
comparable to Khajuraho. Thousands of beautiful women in one temple...
and there are thirty temples still in perfect shape. There used to be
one hundred temples. Seventy temples are in ruins, but in those ruins
also you can find beautiful pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>In one temple, thousands of women, men, loving each other, hugging
each other<span class=s4></span>You can see</p><p>that the stones have become alive, you can see that the stones can
speak. You can see that nature has not been able to create such
beautiful women as those unknown artists have done.</p><p><br></p><p>But if stone can be made so beautiful, so alive that it seems the
woman is just going to come out, that she is just going to start
breathing again, then why can’t we improve on humanity? There is no need
for ugly people. It is our fault and our responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the medical profession is capable of deciding what kind of child
it will be that you are going to produce, because the male sperm has the
whole program, the woman’s egg has the whole program. Both programs can
be read, and if it is not worthwhile to go on, they should be
discarded.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to discard many old conceptions – that your child has to be
your child. But if your child is going to be blind, if your child is
going to be crippled, if your child is going to be just an imbecile, do
you still want it to be your child?</p><p><br></p><p>Will it not be better that people go to the hospitals and donate male
sperm, that women go to the hospitals when they want children? The
couple can go and say, “This is the kind of child we want, so you figure
it out. This is my wife, so you read her eggs” – and every month a woman
is releasing one egg, so there is no trouble – “and you give her the
best sperm from your lab. I want my child to be a genius. I want my
child to be healthy. I want my child to live long.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to drop that stupid idea that it has to be just your sperm.
Can you recognize your sperm? If twelve samples are placed before you,
can you recognize it, that “this is my sperm”? So what is the point? Why
make a fuss about it? Get the best sperm that is possible. Think of the
child and his future – give him all that is best.</p><p>But the most sorry thing is<span class=s4></span>We are doing this
with trees, with animals – and we have improved</p><p>upon animals, upon trees.</p><p><br></p><p>I had one gardener<span class=s4></span>I have lived in many
cities, but wherever I have lived, I have lived surrounded</p><p>with trees. My gardens are almost jungles. This old gardener was
really a genius. He was winning the first prize in the state every year
for producing the biggest flowers, and he wanted to do it in my
garden.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked, “What is your secret? How do you manage to create the
biggest rose in the whole state?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The secret is simple. I don’t allow many flowers to grow on
one rosebush. I cut all the buds and keep only one bud. Naturally, all
the juice of the tree moves into one bud. Instead of creating hundreds
of roseflowers, it creates one roseflower, but then nobody can compete
with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>If this is possible, then rather than having a dozen children it is
better to have one child, but have a child which will have the best
intelligence, the best body, the most beautiful face. But no, people are
interested in having dozens of children. They are exhausted, their
children are born almost exhausted; from the very beginning they are
old.</p><p><br></p><p>What we are doing in nature with trees, with animals, we have not yet
been courageous enough to do with human beings; otherwise, there is no
need for crippled people. It is sad; they are victims of your stupid
ideas. They are suffering because of their parents. There are blind
children, there are deaf children. There are children who are sick from
the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>In Tibet, it used to be a traditional thing that whenever a child was
born they would dip the child in freezing, ice-cold water nine times.
Out of ten children, nine would die.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks inhuman, primitive – but the basic principle is understandable.
Their idea was this: that if these children cannot survive the shock of
freezing water, then in Tibet – which is the land of eternal snows all
around – their whole life will be a misery. “Now one has survived; we
can depend on his strength, his stamina – that he will be able to live
in this remote corner of the world; the very roof of the world.” And
Tibetans are really strong, very strong people. But the reason is
because nine have been sacrificed.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not telling you to sacrifice your children – just don’t produce
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva’s story makes it clear that a man of meditation will be a man
of immense love. He will not be inhuman.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, would not allow any
woman to come close to him. Women had to be eight feet away from him.
What kind of fear<span class=s4></span>? Jaina monks are not allowed
to sit</p><p>on a spot where a woman has been sitting before, because that spot
still has a feminine vibe. These people seem to be insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Nine months they were in their mother’s womb – nine months’
continuous feminine vibe! And half of their being is contributed by the
mother; their flesh, their blood, their skin, their bones are all
contributed by their mother – they all have a feminine vibe. And these
idiots are saying, “Don’t sit in a place where a woman was sitting.”</p><p>So every Jaina monk carries a small mattress, rolled up, with him.
So, wherever he sits, first he puts his mattress as a protection, and
then he sits on the mattress. If feminine vibes are really so powerful,
I think a mattress cannot prevent them. In fact, the mattress itself is
feminine. Have you seen a male mattress?</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha told his disciples, “You have, while walking, to keep your
eyes only four feet ahead, looking down on the earth just four feet
ahead, so that you never see a feminine face. At the most you can see
the feet of a woman, and if you see the feet, move away.”</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of fear...? And these people are meditative? This is
paranoia! They must be tremendously repressed. These are psychologically
sick people, they are sexually pathological.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha had said, “Never touch a woman, never talk to a woman.” Women
are half of humanity! This is simply a male chauvinistic attitude,
absolutely macho.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not based on the transformation of man through meditation,
but on repression of sexuality; that’s why these people are so
fearful.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to touch a woman – I don’t see the point. My people are here...
they are hugging women, touching women, and I don’t see that their
spirituality is destroyed, or their meditation is disturbed. In fact,
just the opposite is the case.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a question... a man has said, “It is very strange that when
I make love to a woman, the next day I understand you better. My
meditation goes deeper.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is feeling strange. There is nothing strange in it, it is how it
should be. Making love to a woman relaxes you, takes your tensions away,
makes you more childlike. Naturally you understand me better, naturally
you meditate deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>Man and woman can help each other tremendously towards meditation and
towards the ultimate transformation of their being.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>HOW CAN THE COMMON MAN RISE ABOVE ALL THE POWER TRIPS OF THOSE IN
POWER, AND TRULY BUILD A WORLD OF THE HEART, OF LOVE, AND OF CARING? IS
SUCH A WORLD REALLY POSSIBLE, OR SHOULD I JUST CONTINUE TO BE GRATEFUL
FOR THE AWARENESS, BLISS, JOY AND GRATEFULNESS THAT HAS COME INTO MY
LIFE SINCE FINDING YOU? PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to prevent people from getting power-oriented is to
start with yourself, because everybody carries in his unconscious the
desire for power of some kind or other.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great emperors of India, Shah Jehan – who made the most
beautiful grave for his wife, the Taj Mahal – was arrested by his own
son, imprisoned, and the son became the emperor. His</p><p>name was Aurangzeb; he was one of the worst emperors India has known.
But sometimes even third-rate human beings have certain insights which
are significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Aurangzeb told his court, “My father has sent a message from the
prison that the whole day sitting there he feels bored. It will be a
tremendous kindness if he can be given thirty children whom he can
teach.” Aurangzeb commented, “This is nothing but lust for power. He has
lost his kingdom, but he still wants thirty children so that he can rule
over them, discipline them.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is insight in the comment. The people who become teachers, the
people who become preachers, the people who become politicians, all are
searching for power in different ways. Even your God is not much
different. How can he be much different? – because he is your creation,
he is your projection. He has all the ingredients of your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>God does not exist anywhere. You paint him.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.… One small child was making a picture, very fast. His
father watched and asked, “What are you doing so quickly?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “I am making a picture of God the father.”</p><p><br></p><p>His father said, “But how can you make a picture of God? You have not
seen him, nobody has seen him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “Don’t be worried: when my picture is complete,
everybody will know how God looks!” All your gods are nothing but the
pictures of that child.</p><p>God punished Adam and Eve – for what? Disobedience. This is lust for
power; otherwise, a God who is love will be able to forgive. But he
drove them out of the Garden of Eden and made them feel guilty that they
have disobeyed.</p><p><br></p><p>But couldn’t he explain to them? Couldn’t he give them another
chance? – even ordinary human fathers will not drive their children out
of the house because they have disobeyed. We expect a little more
compassion from God. And what was their disobedience? They had just
eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge. I don’t think there is
anything wrong in it. Knowledge is not a sin. In fact, God making
knowledge a sin is behaving really insanely.</p><p><br></p><p>He has prohibited them from eating the fruit of eternal life. What
kind of father, what kind of God is he? In fact, he should have told
them, “These are the two best trees in the whole Garden of Eden, so eat
as many apples as possible.” Strange, the apple tree is the tree of
knowledge! “And eat as many fruits of the tree of eternal life” – then
certainly they would not have disobeyed.</p><p><br></p><p>If anybody is criminal in this whole act it is God, not Adam and Eve.
And Adam and Eve did not rebel. In fact, they should have driven God out
of Eden, thrown him out of the garden, told him, “You are no longer
needed, you are out of date. Get lost! Now we are here and we will
manage!” But they must have been very simple people, innocent. God drove
them out in a third-class Ford motorcar.</p><p>And they accepted the guilt, and Christians are still living in that
guilt. Six thousand years have passed, but every Christian is born in
sin. This is God’s lust for power. And the priest found it perfectly
suitable to his own lust for power. He is perfectly in tune with God. He
makes you feel guilty, he makes you feel a sinner – that gives him power
over you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago the Catholic pope informed all the Catholics in
the world that they cannot confess their sins to God direct. Why not
directly? It is now a sin to confess directly to God! They have to
confess to the priest; everything has to go via the right channel. This
is all lust for power. If people start confessing to God, then the
priest is useless – and finally the pope is useless.</p><p><br></p><p>And Catholics confessing their sins to the priest don’t understand
the conspiracy that the power- lusty people are imposing on them. They
are told that if they confess to the priest, God will forgive them. So
they confess, but that makes them more and more enslaved by the priest,
because the priest knows everything about their sins, crimes<span class=s4></span>They cannot leave the Catholic fold; they know</p><p>the priest knows too much about them. Now they are in the hands of
the priest. This is a simple political strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>I know about Indira Gandhi in India. She was very much interested in
my ideas – we had a few meetings. She told me, “My power consists in
having a few files.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t understand. What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “I have files against each politician who can be a
competitor to me, and he knows that I will immediately expose him before
the public, before the court. Rather than becoming the prime minister,
he will be behind bars.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those files now are in the hands of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv
Gandhi was never in politics, but those files are enough: all old
politicians are silent, knowing perfectly well that they can be caught
and exposed. They have committed every kind of crime.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised... when Indira Gandhi’s son, Sanjay Gandhi, had
an accident and died – his plane crashed just near Indira Gandhi’s
house, two blocks away – Indira Gandhi rushed there immediately.
Naturally, you would think a mother would rush immediately; her son has
died. But what she inquired was, “He had some keys with him – where are
those keys?” She had not rushed there for Sanjay Gandhi, she had rushed
there for those two keys, because those two keys were to all the files
containing all the papers against all the Indian politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, it seems she felt relieved by Sanjay Gandhi’s death, because
Sanjay Gandhi was harassing her. It is a well-known fact all over the
country – there are eyewitnesses – that once Sanjay Gandhi slapped
Indira Gandhi. And it was an everyday thing, they were fighting
continuously, because he wanted all those files. Finally, just to keep
the peace, she had given him the keys. His death came as a relief; the
keys were back with her.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me, “How can we stop people from getting into a power
trip?”</p><p><br></p><p>Start from yourself. Just don’t do anything to dominate, and don’t
allow anybody to dominate you either. Take the whole responsibility of
being an individual, and respect the right of everybody else</p><p>to be an individual, to be totally free. Never interfere in anybody’s
life, and never allow anybody else to interfere in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>And be watchful, because the ego is very subtle, its ways are very
subtle. Watch that you are not trying to be powerful in some way – over
your wife, over your children, over your servants.…</p><p><br></p><p>Do you treat your servant exactly the same way as you treat your
boss? If not, then you cannot get rid of the power trip. Respect
everybody: the boss is doing his work, the servant is doing his
work.</p><p><br></p><p>But as it happens now, the servant passes through the room and you
don’t even look at him, you don’t even say, “Hi.” The servant is just a
servant – not to be taken any note of. But if the boss comes in the room
then you stand up, trembling, nervous. What has happened? Your servant
is as much a human being as your boss. Behave with them equally, be
respectful to each individual. What their function is, is secondary.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the whole point in this commune. Somebody is a cleaner,
somebody is a psychotherapist – but in the commune there is no
difference at all. The psychotherapist is not being treated specially,
and the cleaner is not thought to be doing something third rate.</p><p><br></p><p>After the functions, in the evening, you will see that the professor,
the president, the cleaner – they are all hugging, and they are all
dancing in the disco. This is how things should be. Everybody is
contributing to the commune. Everything is absolutely necessary. In
fact, we can live without the professor, but we cannot live without the
cleaner – his function is far more important.</p><p><br></p><p>If you just keep a little alert that you are not dominating anybody
in any way<span class=s4></span>Even small children</p><p>that have unfortunately fallen into your hands, be respectful to
them. That will teach them also to be respectful to everybody. And that
will give them an integrity, individuality, a certain kind of
crystallization, a great spiritual strength. And then they will never
seek power.</p><p><br></p><p>Power is sought only by people who are feeling deep inside an
inferiority complex. So don’t create an inferiority complex in anybody,
and don’t feel yourself in any way inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>All human beings are unique. I cannot say they are equal. That is my
basic point against communism. Communism is absolutely an
unpsychological philosophy. No two human beings are equal. Yes, every
human being is unique. There is no need for equality; what is needed is
uniqueness.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to express your uniqueness, and help others to express their
uniqueness. And destroy the inferiority complex first in yourself, then
in your wife, then in your children, then in your neighbors, in your
friends. And let this fire spread.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see a day somewhere in the future that people will be there but
there will be nobody who is hungry for power. To be hungry for power
simply shows that the man needs psychiatric treatment. All the
politicians of the world, all the presidents, all the prime ministers,
kings and queens, need psychiatric treatment so that they can again
become human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>That atmosphere can be created. We have one million sannyasins around
the world: create that atmosphere, spread that idea to every nook and
corner of the earth.</p><p>We have lived under these power trippers for thousands of years and,
except for suffering and misery, nothing has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I am showing you the way where there is a possibility of a song
bursting out of your heart and a dance, for no reason at all – just for
dance’s sake. It is so joyful to dance with the wind, in the sun, just
the way trees are dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity has not yet become cultured. Civilization has not yet
happened.</p><p>We have to create the ground for it to happen – and we are going to
create it! Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

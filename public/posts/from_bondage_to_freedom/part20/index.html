I LEARNED FROM YOU ABOUT TRUSTING EXISTENCE TOTALLY. BUT I UNDERSTOOD TOTAL TRUST TO MEAN JUST THAT – TOTAL TRUST, TRUST UNTO DEATH. SO I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHEN MY OWN MASTER SUPPORTED PROTECTING OURSELVES WITH GUNS AND SEARCHING VISITORS, OR EVEN JUST BUYING INSURANCE. I BECAME SPLIT: ONE PART OF ME COULD SEE PERFECTLY WELL THAT EXISTENCE CONTAINS WARS AND FAMINES AND HITLERS, AND EVEN JUST THIEVES WHO WILL TAKE YOUR BELONGINGS IF YOU DON’T WATCH THEM.\nANOTHER PART OF ME THREW OUT LOVE AND TRUST TO EXISTENCE, AND WAS REWARDED WITH GREAT JOY AND WHAT SEEMED LIKE A CONSTANT AND CONTINUOUS SHOWER OF MIRACLES.\nTHE EVENTS AND THE DISCOURSES OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE GREATLY SHAKEN MY TRUST AND INTENSIFIED THE SPLIT IN ME.\nPLEASE COMMENT.\nIt was not total trust. Don’t deceive yourself. A trust that is total cannot be shaken by anything. It is unconditional. You have just been hallucinating about total trust. Neither do you know what totality means, nor do you know what trust means.\nIf you trust existence, guns are part of existence too, just as roseflowers. And if you want roseflowers, you will need guns to protect them. But many people think life just a bed of roses. What are you going to do with the thorns? Those guns are the thorns. And it is such a simple thing to understand, even an idiot can understand it.\nWe have not harmed anybody, we are not going to harm anybody. But we are not going to allow anybody to harm you either. To harm is ugly. To allow somebody to harm you is the same, it is ugly. Life in both the cases is harmed.\nAnd what can these three dozen guns – which are not even automatic – do in a world which is full of nuclear weapons? America has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the whole world. Why should they be afraid of three dozen guns which have not been used at all in four years? And there is no possibility of using them.…\nBut if you want, I can just withdraw them today. But then don’t object if Hell’s Angels come and harass you, if fanatic Christians come and harass you, if all kinds of criminals come and destroy your commune. Do you think that will be a more beautiful scene than these three dozen guns, which are not doing any harm to anybody? These guns were not there in the very beginning, but fanatic Christians started coming and harassing people, Hell’s Angels started coming and being a nuisance.\nYou cannot remain naive about the facts of life. It is a struggle. In this struggle you have to remember only one thing, that you are not on the destructive side, that you are not attacking anybody, that you are not harassing anybody.\nSince we have had three dozen guns and a security force, those fanatic Christians and Hell’s Angels and Witnesses of Jehovah have not come again. It seems the gun is far more powerful than Jehovah, more powerful than Jesus Christ. And these are toy guns; in a nuclear world, these guns don’t matter.\nThe attorney general has alerted the army. I have never seen such cowards in my life – to alert the army so that within three hours, any time, they can reach to Rajneeshpuram. People who are living silently, peacefully, meditating, rejoicing, dancing, doing no harm to anybody – for them the army is alerted. The army is not alerted against all the criminals in New York, in San Francisco and L.A.\nEvery moment there is a crime committed in New York – that is okay, that is the accepted American way of life. We are strangers; we are not committing any crime every moment. One person is dying of AIDS in L.A. every day. That means there must be thousands of homosexuals in L.A. Do you want to compete with New York and L.A. and San Francisco? Do you want to follow the American way of life, which is nothing but crime?\nIf you want, we can withdraw those three dozen guns; they don’t matter. But you are being simply stupid. Those three dozen guns are keeping all the cowards away from you. And in Oregon I don’t see anybody other than cowards.\nWe have been inviting the governor, the attorney general, to come and see: “Be our guest. Stay here for a day or two, go around the commune and see; these people are not criminals.” They have never accepted the invitation. These cowards are afraid of toy guns, so why not keep them afraid?\nAnd you are asking me, “People are searched.” It can be stopped, but then I cannot stay here with\nyou, because the government is making every effort to destroy you. Then drugs will be brought in, planted here, and you will be arrested. That is their idea: one thousand sannyasins behind bars.\nRight now they have no reason, but drugs just have to be brought and put in your houses. While you are working in the fields, making the roads, listening to me, your houses can become dangerous. Then who is going to be responsible for those drugs? It is perfectly right; anybody who enters here should be totally searched. We don’t want any kind of interference with our people’s lives.\nBut if you are happy, you have nothing to lose – you will only lose me. Then I cannot stay here a single moment, because I cannot see you imprisoned, harassed, beaten; your houses bulldozed – which you have created with tremendous creativity, love.\nAnd you go on asking these stupid questions. Just last night, one woman sannyasin wrote a letter, that in the press conference when I asked people if they were with me to raise their hands – ten thousand hands were raised, and she says she wanted to stand against me. And still she writes to me, “Beloved Master, I love you too much.” Is she blind – she cannot see ten thousand hands? To me it does not matter, she could have stood up. But why, in the first place, should you be in this commune?\nA commune has to be an organic unity – not a union but an organic unity, just like the body is. The left hand cannot go against the right hand. The legs cannot go against the head. The heart cannot go against the head. This is not a union, it is an organic unity. A commune has to be organic, one.\nWhoever wrote that letter – either she should change her attitude, or she should leave. There is no reason – why be here? Why live in antagonism with five thousand people? She seems to be somebody planted by the FBI, by the attorney general, or by some other agency. She is not a true sannyasin.\nAnd she is also a coward. What is the point of writing the letter to me? You should have stood up and seen what happened then. While I was here, nothing would have happened. But when I would have left, five thousand people – they are not cannibals; otherwise they would have made a good breakfast of you. But they can play football; that is not against spirituality.\nSo remember: if you don’t feel at ease with the whole, just leave the place. And don’t ask stupid questions. Before you ask a question, think over what you are asking. Those security people are for you, so that you can meditate without disturbance, you can work without disturbance, you can live without disturbance.\nAnd strange, that just three dozen security people can keep you in peace for four years. You should be grateful to these people, because they are bored with the guns, just standing with the guns for four years, no chance to use them. And if sometime they have to use them, by that time they may have forgotten how to use them. They are for your security, and you seem to be against them. You are nuts or something!\nIf the government takes the responsibility that no nuisance will be done in this commune, we can withdraw the security forces – and what security forces against the greatest world power!\nIn these four years, I have seen that Adolf Hitler did only one thing wrong: rather than attacking Russia, he should have attacked America! These cowards, who are afraid of three dozen ordinary guns – not even automatic.… The American seems to be the most cowardly, spineless...!\nYou made the Constitution, and you have put the people to whom this land belongs into reservations. The reservation is nothing but the American name for concentration camps – yes, without barbed wire. You have a more sophisticated way: you give those Red Indians pensions. Now, people who have nothing to do, and get enough money, what do you expect them to do? They will gamble, they will drink, they will fight. They are all drunkards, gamblers – rowdy. These people cannot think of independence, they cannot think of freedom. You have not put barbed wire around them, you have put barbed wire around their very soul!\nIf Americans have any integrity and dignity, the first thing they will do is: give the government to the Red Indians. They will decide who is going to stay here and who is not going to stay here. Let them decide about Ronald Reagan’s green card, because his forefathers entered this country without any visa, they had no green cards. They committed crimes.\nAnd it is a very simple thing to understand: If Adam and Eve disobeyed God and every Christian is still born in sin because of Adam and Eve, then what about Americans? Your forefathers committed all the crimes, and it was only three hundred years ago. Suddenly you have become president, you have become governors, you have become attorney generals, you have become judges, Supreme Court judges, and you have started deciding. This is not your country.\nThis thing has to be brought to their notice, and to the whole world’s notice. You talk against the Soviet Union, you talk against slavery – and that’s what you are practicing here.\nThose three dozen security people keep all the idiots away. And I perfectly approve of it. If just by having guns, without even using them.And I have told them not to use them unless it becomes\nnecessary; and I will not let it become necessary.\nTomorrow, before the American embassy in India, ten thousand sannyasins are protesting – this is the beginning – that we are being mistreated. Every American embassy around the world will have to face the sannyasins. If anything is done to my people here, I have my people around the world: no American embassy can function. I have enough people in every country to force their government to disconnect their relationship with America.\nThis country is not a democracy; this country is simply hypocrisy! But till the whole world is awakened against this country’s criminal politicians, we have every right to defend our small minority. They are trying to destroy it in every way.\nThey go on moving so slowly, and the reason is, they want to make some deal with the criminals who are hiding in Germany, in the Black Forest. They want to give them immunity, so that they can point to innocent sannyasins and accuse them of all the crimes that they have committed. That’s why they are delaying.\nOut of the twenty criminals only one young woman, Ava, came back from Seattle. She is trying to give her testimony, and they have been postponing. I don’t understand it. She has been in the group\nwho committed all the crimes; she is an eyewitness, she can expose the whole group. Not taking my interview, not taking Ava’s interview, simply indicates one thing: they want to make some deal with Sheela and her gang, so the criminals are protected and the commune can be destroyed.\nBut I am not going to let it happen. And if it happens, America will repent for it, because our fight will not end here in Oregon. It will go on into every nook and corner of the world.\nThey have never faced nonpolitical mystics. This will be a new experience for the idiots. I am really excited.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATIVITY IN MUSIC AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH, FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS. YET THE ASHRAM, THE COMMUNE, IS THE ONLY PLACE I HAVE LIVED IN WHERE IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE TOTALLY AS AN ARTIST OR MUSICIAN.\nTHERE ARE ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS HERE, INCLUDING MYSELF, WHO HAVE BEEN YEARNING FOR THE SPACE TO PURSUE THEIR ART IN A CLIMATE OF MEDITATION, BUT HAVE HAD TO PUT IT ASIDE TO BE WITH YOU.\nIN THE PAST, WE WERE TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME. ISN’T NOW THE RIGHT TIME?\nIt is always the right time. You just have to remember: who is going to prepare food for you? You can play music, you can be creative; but don’t ask for food, don’t ask for houses, don’t ask for clothes – because others also want to be creative. Everybody has his own guitar. Do you want that you play the guitar, and the others make the roads and the houses for you? And they should prepare food for you?\nDo the necessary work that keeps you alive, and in the remaining time you are free. Who is preventing you? Play music in the night when you are free. But then you have your girlfriend, your boyfriend.… Sacrifice something. Either sacrifice food, clothes, houses, or sacrifice girlfriends and boyfriends. Every creativity needs sacrifice, because who is going to do all the other necessary things for you?\nI have been getting reports every day that people are not turning up in time in a few places. For example in the dairy, people are not coming on time; then the milk cannot be delivered to the commune in time. The cows are waiting for you, but you are missing.\nYou have got freedom, but you don’t understand that freedom brings more responsibility than slavery. Slavery has no responsibility. It seems most of the people in the world are happier with slavery\nthan with freedom, because in slavery they have to do something. Somebody is goading them continuously to do it!\nIn freedom, nobody is there to force them. But if people who prepare food are not reaching there in time, then you will not get your lunch in time, or you may not get your lunch at all.\nI will see. One week more, and I warn you: if you cannot take responsibility and work as a responsible member of a commune, then you are asking for a strict discipline, order – good names for slavery.\nSeven days more... otherwise, I will advise all the presidents of the corporations, all coordinators, to enforce the hours – because in four years it has never happened; you were always on time in every place. People are leaving early, coming late, coming whenever they want, not coming whenever they do not want. You are behaving in a very unintelligent way. You are asking for a fascist rule! It seems you have become addicted to the relationship of master and slave.\nI am reminded that in the French revolution there was one central jail, which was only for people with lifelong imprisonment. Their chains had no keys, because the locks were never to be opened. When they died, then their hands would be broken and the chains taken off.\nThe revolutionaries thought that all those people, almost two thousand, who had been living in the jail for their whole life – somebody had lived there for fifty years, somebody for forty years, somebody for thirty years – should be released. But do you know what those prisoners said? “We don’t want to be released.”\nThe man who had been there for fifty years – he was caught when he was twenty – said, “I have completely forgotten the outside world, and here life is more comfortable. Food is given at the right time every day, we don’t have to bother about it. And my eyes have become accustomed to this dark cell in which I have lived for fifty years. And these heavy chains on my hands and on my feet have become almost part of my body. Without them I will feel something is missing. I don’t think I can even sleep without them.”\nBut revolutionaries are revolutionaries – they forced them. They cut their chains and forced them to get out of the prison. But by the evening almost everybody was coming back. They said, “Outside, our eyes hurt; that much sun we cannot tolerate. Who is going to give us food? For fifty years, getting food without any trouble – now we don’t know any skill to earn our livelihood. Who is going to give us clothes? And the greatest problem is, we cannot sleep without the chains. Please give us our chains back! And we want to sleep in our dark cells.” The revolutionaries could not believe it.\nBut this is a reality of all human beings. For four years there was no complaint, and you were perfectly happy. Now I am receiving letters of complaint, that this is wrong and that is wrong, and guns should not be here. Everybody should be allowed to do whatever he wants – play music, do painting, write poetry, or just lie down by the side of the lake and have a good sunbath.\nI am not saying that you should not do this, but first comes the commune’s survival. You should do everything that the commune’s survival needs. Then play music, paint, sculpt, or do whatever you want: dance, sing. But the commune’s necessary work should not suffer.\nIf within seven days it does not change, then you will be back under a strict disciplined order. And those who cannot fit will have to leave the place. Why should anybody else take your responsibility? You have to be responsible for yourself. Outside in the world, do you think you can go on playing music and somebody will come with all kinds of dishes, Chinese food, and spaghetti, because you are such a great musician? Spaghetti comes first. Your music is your private affair.\nSo make it clearly understood that only seven days... and you have to learn responsibility; otherwise you lose your freedom. I cannot help it. Your president, Prem Hasya, is continuously coming to me, “What to do? People don’t come to work. They have a strange idea of freedom.”\nI respect your freedom.\nI want you to remain totally free.\nBut that is possible only if you accept your responsibility.\nAnd your freedom will be only in proportion to your responsibility – neither less nor more. Question 3\nBELOVED MASTER,\nON OUR FARM, THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS OBVIOUS. THE COWS NEED TO BE MILKED ON TIME, THE VEGETABLES HAVE TO BE PICKED FOR EACH MEAL. REJECTING THE OLD WAYS OF ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY HAS CREATED A GAP. LESS IS GETTING DONE AND PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED. IT’S VERY EXCITING, AND A SPONTANEOUS KIND OF ORGANIZATION SEEMS TO BE ARISING, BUT IT IS STILL VERY CHAOTIC.\nHOW CAN WE GET THE WORSHIP DONE? HOW DO WE BALANCE WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNE?\nDon’t be worried. I have given seven days’ time: either you do it, or it will be done the way it has been done for four years. It is your choice.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED MASTER,\nIS THERE SUCH A THING AS PERSONAL POWER WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM POWER OVER OTHERS? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY?\nThey are two totally different things: personal power and power over others. Not only are they different, they are diametrically opposite.\nThe person who knows himself, understands his own being, understands the meaning of his life, suddenly has an explosion of power. But it is more like love, like compassion. It is more like moonlight than like sunlight – cool, calm, beautiful. Such a man has no inferiority complex at all. He\nis so full, so contented, so utterly blissful, there is no reason for him to feel any ambition to have power over others.\nI call it the power of the mystic.\nPower over others is political, and the people who are interested in power over others are people who feel a deep inferiority complex. They are continuously comparing themselves with others, and feeling themselves inferior. They want to prove to the world and to themselves that it is not so – they are superior beings. All politicians suffer from an inferiority complex. All politicians need to be treated psychologically.\nThese are the sick people, and because of these sick people the whole world has been in immense suffering. Five thousand wars in three thousand years!\nAnd there is no end for the seeker of power over others, because there are always people left out of his power. That makes him still feel his inferiority. Otherwise, what is the need for anybody to become Alexander the Great? – just sheer stupidity. The man died when he was only thirty-three. He could not live for a single moment, he could not love for a single moment. His life of thirty-three years was, in the beginning, preparing to become a world conqueror, and the remaining part was fighting, killing, burning. The only idea in his mind was to become the world conqueror.\nWhen he was going to India, on the way, passing the boundaries of Greece, he met one of the rarest men in the history of man, Diogenes. He used to live naked. He was so beautiful, it was perfectly suitable for him to live naked.\nClothes serve many purposes, of climate, of culture, but the basic purposeAll the animals can\nmanage to live without clothes in every climate all around the world. What is wrong with man? Is he the most vulnerable and weak animal in the whole world? No. Clothes were first invented because all people don’t have beautiful bodies. You know people by their faces. In fact, even you yourself, if you see a picture of your body naked, without the head, you will not be able to recognize that this is your body.\nDiogenes was an immensely beautiful man; he needed no clothes. He lived by the side of a river. It was early morning and he was taking a sunbath. He had only one companion, a dog, and only one possession, an old type of lamp.\nAlexander heard that Diogenes was very close when they were passing the boundary of Greece. He said, “I have heard so much about the man. He seems to be a little strange, but I would like to see him.” Alexander went to see Diogenes – Diogenes was resting. His dog was sitting by his side. Alexander said to him, “Diogenes, Alexander the Great has come to see you. It is a great favor, it is unique; I have never gone to see anybody.”\nDiogenes did not even sit up. He remained lying on the sand, laughed, looked at his dog and said to the dog, “Have you heard? A man calling himself great – what do you think about it? He must be suffering from great inferiority. This is a projection to hide some wound.” It was a truth. Even Alexander could not deny it.\nAlexander said, “I don’t have much time; otherwise I would have sat here and listened to some wisdom from you.”\nDiogenes said, “What is the hurry? Where are you going – to conquer the world? But have you ever thought, if by chance you succeed in conquering the world, what will you do then? – because there is no other world, there is only one world. Right now, fighting, invading, you can go on forgetting your inferiority; but when you have succeeded, your inferiority will come back, will surface again.”\nAlexander said, “Returning, I will come and stay for a few days here and try to understand. Whatsoever you are saying hurts, but it is true. In fact, just the idea that there is no other world makes me sad. Yes, if I conquer the whole world, then what am I going to do? Then I will be just useless, and all that is hidden in me is bound to surface.”\nBut Diogenes said, “You will never return, because this kind of ambition is unending. Nobody comes back.” And strangely, Alexander never came back. He died while he was coming back, before reaching Greece. And a beautiful story has been told since then, because the same day Diogenes also died. It is just a story, but very significant.\nThere is a river, according to Greek mythology, which you have to pass before you enter paradise. Diogenes was just a few feet ahead, Alexander just behind him. Seeing Diogenes, the same beautiful man, naked – and now Alexander was also naked, but not with that beauty – just to cover up, Alexander said, “This is a strange coincidence, the meeting of a world conqueror with a beggar!”\nDiogenes laughed and he said, “You are right. Only on one point are you wrong – you don’t know who is the conqueror and who is the beggar. Just look at me and look at yourself. I never conquered anybody, yet I am a conqueror – a conqueror of myself. You tried to conquer the whole world, and what have you got? Just a sheer wasting of your whole life. You are just a beggar!”\nThe personal power belongs to the mystic – one who has had his flower of consciousness blossom, who has released his fragrance, his love, his compassion, far and wide. It is a very subtle power. Nothing can prevent it; it simply reaches to your heart. It simply makes you fall in tune with the mystic – into a kind of synchronicity, a harmony. You don’t become a slave, you become a lover. A great friendliness, a great gratitude arises in you.\nJust the presence of the mystic creates an immense aura. In that aura, whoever is open, available, receptive, immediately starts feeling like bursting into a song or into a dance.\nPolitical power is ugly. Power over others is ugly. It is inhuman, because to have power over somebody means to reduce that person to a thing. He becomes your possession.\nFor example, in China, for centuries the husband had the power over his wife even to kill her. The law allowed it, because the wife was nothing but a possession – like you possess a chair, and if you want to destroy it, it is not a crime; it was your chair. And if you kill your wife, it was your wifeFor\ncenturies no man in China had been punished for having killed his wife – up to this century.\nPower over anybody reduces the other person’s individuality, reduces his spirituality, and he becomes just a commodity, a thing. For centuries men and women have been sold in the markets\nlike any other commodity. Once you have purchased a slave, you have all power over the slave. This may fulfill some insane and sick psychology, but it is not healthy. No politician is healthy – I mean spiritually.\nWhen Nixon was caught bugging and tapping other people’s phones, and he had finally to resign as the president, Mao Zedong’s remark is remarkable. He said, “Every politician does it. There is nothing special in it. Why are they making so much fuss about it? Poor Nixon has just been caught doing it.”\nAnd even after Nixon’s resignation as president, Mao sent a special plane, his own plane, to take Nixon to China – to console him, to say that this is just stupidity. “Whatever you were doing is being done all over the world. All the politicians are doing it. What was wrong was being caught. You were an amateur.”\nWhat politicians are doing all over the world, all through history, is simply inhuman, ugly. But the reason, the basic reason is that they have a deep feeling of inferiority, and they want to prove to themselves that it is not so. “Look, you have so much power, so many people in your hand you can make or mar, so many nuclear weapons in your hand. Just push a button and you can destroy the whole planet.”\nPower over others is destructive – always destructive. In a better world anybody who is ambitious, who wants to be more important than others, ahead of others, should be treated psychologically. Only humbleness, simplicity, naturalness – no comparison with anybodyBecause everybody is\nunique, comparison is impossible.\nHow can you compare a roseflower with a marigold? How can you say who is superior and who is inferior? Both have their beauty, and both have blossomed, danced in the sun, in the wind, in the rain.lived their life totally.\nEvery human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different. Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that everybody is equal, as communists think. I am absolutely against communism, for the simple reason that the whole philosophy of communism is against psychology and against all psychological research.\nNobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life; you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being; you have to discover your own being.\nIt is perfectly good to be powerful as a mystic.\nIt is ugly, disgusting, stinking to have even a slight desire for having power over others. Question 5\nBELOVED MASTER,\nIN THE PAST, YOU’VE ALWAYS SAID THAT OUR LOVE IS WHAT KEEPS YOU IN YOUR BODY. IS ALL THIS NEGATIVITY AND EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY AFFECTING YOU? WILL WE LOSE YOU?\nThere is every possibility. Question 6\nBELOVED MASTER,\nHUMAN NATURE IS TRICKY. IT WILL CREATE A SIMPLE INSTITUTION TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN TURN IT INTO AN ESTABLISHMENT SO AS TO CONTROL IT AND THE PEOPLE IT IS THERE TO SERVE. IN SUCH A SITUATION, CAN AN ENLIGHTENED MASTER CREATE AN INSTITUTION OR A FLEXIBLE, FLUID RELATING, WHERE THE EMERGENCE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN ORGANIZATION IS NOT POSSIBLE?\nAnd what do you think I am doing here! Question 7\nBELOVED MASTER,\nTHAT’S ALL – THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS.\nThat’s great!\nOkay?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5186","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_bondage_to_freedom/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_bondage_to_freedom/>From Bondage to Freedom</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20 The power of the mystic</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5186 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Bondage_to_Freedom/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I LEARNED FROM YOU
ABOUT TRUSTING EXISTENCE TOTALLY. BUT I UNDERSTOOD TOTAL TRUST TO MEAN
JUST THAT – TOTAL TRUST, TRUST UNTO DEATH. SO I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY
UNDERSTANDING WHEN MY OWN MASTER SUPPORTED PROTECTING OURSELVES WITH
GUNS AND SEARCHING VISITORS, OR EVEN JUST BUYING INSURANCE. I BECAME
SPLIT: ONE PART OF ME COULD SEE PERFECTLY WELL THAT EXISTENCE CONTAINS
WARS AND FAMINES AND HITLERS, AND EVEN JUST THIEVES WHO WILL TAKE YOUR
BELONGINGS IF YOU DON’T WATCH THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>ANOTHER PART OF ME THREW OUT LOVE AND TRUST TO EXISTENCE, AND WAS
REWARDED WITH GREAT JOY AND WHAT SEEMED LIKE A CONSTANT AND CONTINUOUS
SHOWER OF MIRACLES.</p><p><br></p><p>THE EVENTS AND THE DISCOURSES OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE GREATLY
SHAKEN MY TRUST AND INTENSIFIED THE SPLIT IN ME.</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not total trust. Don’t deceive yourself. A trust that is total
cannot be shaken by anything. It is unconditional. You have just been
hallucinating about total trust. Neither do you know what totality
means, nor do you know what trust means.</p><p>If you trust existence, guns are part of existence too, just as
roseflowers. And if you want roseflowers, you will need guns to protect
them. But many people think life just a bed of roses. What are you going
to do with the thorns? Those guns are the thorns. And it is such a
simple thing to understand, even an idiot can understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>We have not harmed anybody, we are not going to harm anybody. But we
are not going to allow anybody to harm you either. To harm is ugly. To
allow somebody to harm you is the same, it is ugly. Life in both the
cases is harmed.</p><p><br></p><p>And what can these three dozen guns – which are not even automatic –
do in a world which is full of nuclear weapons? America has enough
nuclear weapons to destroy the whole world. Why should they be afraid of
three dozen guns which have not been used at all in four years? And
there is no possibility of using them.…</p><p><br></p><p>But if you want, I can just withdraw them today. But then don’t
object if Hell’s Angels come and harass you, if fanatic Christians come
and harass you, if all kinds of criminals come and destroy your commune.
Do you think that will be a more beautiful scene than these three dozen
guns, which are not doing any harm to anybody? These guns were not there
in the very beginning, but fanatic Christians started coming and
harassing people, Hell’s Angels started coming and being a nuisance.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot remain naive about the facts of life. It is a struggle. In
this struggle you have to remember only one thing, that you are not on
the destructive side, that you are not attacking anybody, that you are
not harassing anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Since we have had three dozen guns and a security force, those
fanatic Christians and Hell’s Angels and Witnesses of Jehovah have not
come again. It seems the gun is far more powerful than Jehovah, more
powerful than Jesus Christ. And these are toy guns; in a nuclear world,
these guns don’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>The attorney general has alerted the army. I have never seen such
cowards in my life – to alert the army so that within three hours, any
time, they can reach to Rajneeshpuram. People who are living silently,
peacefully, meditating, rejoicing, dancing, doing no harm to anybody –
for them the army is alerted. The army is not alerted against all the
criminals in New York, in San Francisco and L.A.</p><p><br></p><p>Every moment there is a crime committed in New York – that is okay,
that is the accepted American way of life. We are strangers; we are not
committing any crime every moment. One person is dying of AIDS in L.A.
every day. That means there must be thousands of homosexuals in L.A. Do
you want to compete with New York and L.A. and San Francisco? Do you
want to follow the American way of life, which is nothing but crime?</p><p><br></p><p>If you want, we can withdraw those three dozen guns; they don’t
matter. But you are being simply stupid. Those three dozen guns are
keeping all the cowards away from you. And in Oregon I don’t see anybody
other than cowards.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been inviting the governor, the attorney general, to come and
see: “Be our guest. Stay here for a day or two, go around the commune
and see; these people are not criminals.” They have never accepted the
invitation. These cowards are afraid of toy guns, so why not keep them
afraid?</p><p>And you are asking me, “People are searched.<span class=s4></span>”
It can be stopped, but then I cannot stay here with</p><p>you, because the government is making every effort to destroy you.
Then drugs will be brought in, planted here, and you will be arrested.
That is their idea: one thousand sannyasins behind bars.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now they have no reason, but drugs just have to be brought and
put in your houses. While you are working in the fields, making the
roads, listening to me, your houses can become dangerous. Then who is
going to be responsible for those drugs? It is perfectly right; anybody
who enters here should be totally searched. We don’t want any kind of
interference with our people’s lives.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are happy, you have nothing to lose – you will only lose
me. Then I cannot stay here a single moment, because I cannot see you
imprisoned, harassed, beaten; your houses bulldozed – which you have
created with tremendous creativity, love.</p><p><br></p><p>And you go on asking these stupid questions. Just last night, one
woman sannyasin wrote a letter, that in the press conference when I
asked people if they were with me to raise their hands – ten thousand
hands were raised, and she says she wanted to stand against me. And
still she writes to me, “Beloved Master, I love you too much.” Is she
blind – she cannot see ten thousand hands? To me it does not matter, she
could have stood up. But why, in the first place, should you be in this
commune?</p><p><br></p><p>A commune has to be an organic unity – not a union but an organic
unity, just like the body is. The left hand cannot go against the right
hand. The legs cannot go against the head. The heart cannot go against
the head. This is not a union, it is an organic unity. A commune has to
be organic, one.</p><p><br></p><p>Whoever wrote that letter – either she should change her attitude, or
she should leave. There is no reason – why be here? Why live in
antagonism with five thousand people? She seems to be somebody planted
by the FBI, by the attorney general, or by some other agency. She is not
a true sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>And she is also a coward. What is the point of writing the letter to
me? You should have stood up and seen what happened then. While I was
here, nothing would have happened. But when I would have left, five
thousand people – they are not cannibals; otherwise they would have made
a good breakfast of you. But they can play football; that is not against
spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember: if you don’t feel at ease with the whole, just leave the
place. And don’t ask stupid questions. Before you ask a question, think
over what you are asking. Those security people are for you, so that you
can meditate without disturbance, you can work without disturbance, you
can live without disturbance.</p><p><br></p><p>And strange, that just three dozen security people can keep you in
peace for four years. You should be grateful to these people, because
they are bored with the guns, just standing with the guns for four
years, no chance to use them. And if sometime they have to use them, by
that time they may have forgotten how to use them. They are for your
security, and you seem to be against them. You are nuts or
something!</p><p><br></p><p>If the government takes the responsibility that no nuisance will be
done in this commune, we can withdraw the security forces – and what
security forces against the greatest world power!</p><p>In these four years, I have seen that Adolf Hitler did only one thing
wrong: rather than attacking Russia, he should have attacked America!
These cowards, who are afraid of three dozen ordinary guns – not even
automatic.… The American seems to be the most cowardly,
spineless...!</p><p><br></p><p>You made the Constitution, and you have put the people to whom this
land belongs into reservations. The reservation is nothing but the
American name for concentration camps – yes, without barbed wire. You
have a more sophisticated way: you give those Red Indians pensions. Now,
people who have nothing to do, and get enough money, what do you expect
them to do? They will gamble, they will drink, they will fight. They are
all drunkards, gamblers – rowdy. These people cannot think of
independence, they cannot think of freedom. You have not put barbed wire
around them, you have put barbed wire around their very soul!</p><p><br></p><p>If Americans have any integrity and dignity, the first thing they
will do is: give the government to the Red Indians. They will decide who
is going to stay here and who is not going to stay here. Let them decide
about Ronald Reagan’s green card, because his forefathers entered this
country without any visa, they had no green cards. They committed
crimes.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is a very simple thing to understand: If Adam and Eve
disobeyed God and every Christian is still born in sin because of Adam
and Eve, then what about Americans? Your forefathers committed all the
crimes, and it was only three hundred years ago. Suddenly you have
become president, you have become governors, you have become attorney
generals, you have become judges, Supreme Court judges, and you have
started deciding. This is not your country.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing has to be brought to their notice, and to the whole
world’s notice. You talk against the Soviet Union, you talk against
slavery – and that’s what you are practicing here.</p><p><br></p><p>Those three dozen security people keep all the idiots away. And I
perfectly approve of it. If just by having guns, without even using
them.<span class=s4></span>And I have told them not to use them unless
it becomes</p><p>necessary; and I will not let it become necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow, before the American embassy in India, ten thousand
sannyasins are protesting – this is the beginning – that we are being
mistreated. Every American embassy around the world will have to face
the sannyasins. If anything is done to my people here, I have my people
around the world: no American embassy can function. I have enough people
in every country to force their government to disconnect their
relationship with America.</p><p><br></p><p>This country is not a democracy; this country is simply hypocrisy!
But till the whole world is awakened against this country’s criminal
politicians, we have every right to defend our small minority. They are
trying to destroy it in every way.</p><p><br></p><p>They go on moving so slowly, and the reason is, they want to make
some deal with the criminals who are hiding in Germany, in the Black
Forest. They want to give them immunity, so that they can point to
innocent sannyasins and accuse them of all the crimes that they have
committed. That’s why they are delaying.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of the twenty criminals only one young woman, Ava, came back from
Seattle. She is trying to give her testimony, and they have been
postponing. I don’t understand it. She has been in the group</p><p>who committed all the crimes; she is an eyewitness, she can expose
the whole group. Not taking my interview, not taking Ava’s interview,
simply indicates one thing: they want to make some deal with Sheela and
her gang, so the criminals are protected and the commune can be
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not going to let it happen. And if it happens, America will
repent for it, because our fight will not end here in Oregon. It will go
on into every nook and corner of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>They have never faced nonpolitical mystics. This will be a new
experience for the idiots. I am really excited.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATIVITY IN MUSIC
AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH, FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS. YET THE ASHRAM, THE
COMMUNE, IS THE ONLY PLACE I HAVE LIVED IN WHERE IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
TO LIVE TOTALLY AS AN ARTIST OR MUSICIAN.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS HERE, INCLUDING MYSELF, WHO HAVE BEEN
YEARNING FOR THE SPACE TO PURSUE THEIR ART IN A CLIMATE OF MEDITATION,
BUT HAVE HAD TO PUT IT ASIDE TO BE WITH YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE PAST, WE WERE TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
ISN’T NOW THE RIGHT TIME?</p><p><br></p><p>It is always the right time. You just have to remember: who is going
to prepare food for you? You can play music, you can be creative; but
don’t ask for food, don’t ask for houses, don’t ask for clothes –
because others also want to be creative. Everybody has his own guitar.
Do you want that you play the guitar, and the others make the roads and
the houses for you? And they should prepare food for you?</p><p><br></p><p>Do the necessary work that keeps you alive, and in the remaining time
you are free. Who is preventing you? Play music in the night when you
are free. But then you have your girlfriend, your boyfriend.… Sacrifice
something. Either sacrifice food, clothes, houses, or sacrifice
girlfriends and boyfriends. Every creativity needs sacrifice, because
who is going to do all the other necessary things for you?</p><p><br></p><p>I have been getting reports every day that people are not turning up
in time in a few places. For example in the dairy, people are not coming
on time; then the milk cannot be delivered to the commune in time. The
cows are waiting for you, but you are missing.</p><p><br></p><p>You have got freedom, but you don’t understand that freedom brings
more responsibility than slavery. Slavery has no responsibility. It
seems most of the people in the world are happier with slavery</p><p>than with freedom, because in slavery they have to do something.
Somebody is goading them continuously to do it!</p><p><br></p><p>In freedom, nobody is there to force them. But if people who prepare
food are not reaching there in time, then you will not get your lunch in
time, or you may not get your lunch at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I will see. One week more, and I warn you: if you cannot take
responsibility and work as a responsible member of a commune, then you
are asking for a strict discipline, order – good names for slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>Seven days more... otherwise, I will advise all the presidents of the
corporations, all coordinators, to enforce the hours – because in four
years it has never happened; you were always on time in every place.
People are leaving early, coming late, coming whenever they want, not
coming whenever they do not want. You are behaving in a very
unintelligent way. You are asking for a fascist rule! It seems you have
become addicted to the relationship of master and slave.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded that in the French revolution there was one central
jail, which was only for people with lifelong imprisonment. Their chains
had no keys, because the locks were never to be opened. When they died,
then their hands would be broken and the chains taken off.</p><p><br></p><p>The revolutionaries thought that all those people, almost two
thousand, who had been living in the jail for their whole life –
somebody had lived there for fifty years, somebody for forty years,
somebody for thirty years – should be released. But do you know what
those prisoners said? “We don’t want to be released.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man who had been there for fifty years – he was caught when he
was twenty – said, “I have completely forgotten the outside world, and
here life is more comfortable. Food is given at the right time every
day, we don’t have to bother about it. And my eyes have become
accustomed to this dark cell in which I have lived for fifty years. And
these heavy chains on my hands and on my feet have become almost part of
my body. Without them I will feel something is missing. I don’t think I
can even sleep without them.”</p><p><br></p><p>But revolutionaries are revolutionaries – they forced them. They cut
their chains and forced them to get out of the prison. But by the
evening almost everybody was coming back. They said, “Outside, our eyes
hurt; that much sun we cannot tolerate. Who is going to give us food?
For fifty years, getting food without any trouble – now we don’t know
any skill to earn our livelihood. Who is going to give us clothes? And
the greatest problem is, we cannot sleep without the chains. Please give
us our chains back! And we want to sleep in our dark cells.” The
revolutionaries could not believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is a reality of all human beings. For four years there was
no complaint, and you were perfectly happy. Now I am receiving letters
of complaint, that this is wrong and that is wrong, and guns should not
be here. Everybody should be allowed to do whatever he wants – play
music, do painting, write poetry, or just lie down by the side of the
lake and have a good sunbath.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying that you should not do this, but first comes the
commune’s survival. You should do everything that the commune’s survival
needs. Then play music, paint, sculpt, or do whatever you want: dance,
sing. But the commune’s necessary work should not suffer.</p><p>If within seven days it does not change, then you will be back under
a strict disciplined order. And those who cannot fit will have to leave
the place. Why should anybody else take your responsibility? You have to
be responsible for yourself. Outside in the world, do you think you can
go on playing music and somebody will come with all kinds of dishes,
Chinese food, and spaghetti, because you are such a great musician?
Spaghetti comes first. Your music is your private affair.</p><p><br></p><p>So make it clearly understood that only seven days... and you have to
learn responsibility; otherwise you lose your freedom. I cannot help it.
Your president, Prem Hasya, is continuously coming to me, “What to do?
People don’t come to work. They have a strange idea of freedom.”</p><p><br></p><p>I respect your freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to remain totally free.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is possible only if you accept your responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>And your freedom will be only in proportion to your responsibility –
neither less nor more. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>ON OUR FARM, THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS OBVIOUS. THE COWS NEED
TO BE MILKED ON TIME, THE VEGETABLES HAVE TO BE PICKED FOR EACH MEAL.
REJECTING THE OLD WAYS OF ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY HAS CREATED A GAP.
LESS IS GETTING DONE AND PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED. IT’S VERY EXCITING, AND A
SPONTANEOUS KIND OF ORGANIZATION SEEMS TO BE ARISING, BUT IT IS STILL
VERY CHAOTIC.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW CAN WE GET THE WORSHIP DONE? HOW DO WE BALANCE WHAT WE WANT TO DO
AND THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried. I have given seven days’ time: either you do it, or
it will be done the way it has been done for four years. It is your
choice.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IS THERE SUCH A THING AS PERSONAL POWER WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM POWER
OVER OTHERS? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POWER AND
RESPONSIBILITY?</p><p><br></p><p>They are two totally different things: personal power and power over
others. Not only are they different, they are diametrically
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who knows himself, understands his own being, understands
the meaning of his life, suddenly has an explosion of power. But it is
more like love, like compassion. It is more like moonlight than like
sunlight – cool, calm, beautiful. Such a man has no inferiority complex
at all. He</p><p>is so full, so contented, so utterly blissful, there is no reason for
him to feel any ambition to have power over others.</p><p><br></p><p>I call it the power of the mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>Power over others is political, and the people who are interested in
power over others are people who feel a deep inferiority complex. They
are continuously comparing themselves with others, and feeling
themselves inferior. They want to prove to the world and to themselves
that it is not so – they are superior beings. All politicians suffer
from an inferiority complex. All politicians need to be treated
psychologically.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the sick people, and because of these sick people the whole
world has been in immense suffering. Five thousand wars in three
thousand years!</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no end for the seeker of power over others, because
there are always people left out of his power. That makes him still feel
his inferiority. Otherwise, what is the need for anybody to become
Alexander the Great? – just sheer stupidity. The man died when he was
only thirty-three. He could not live for a single moment, he could not
love for a single moment. His life of thirty-three years was, in the
beginning, preparing to become a world conqueror, and the remaining part
was fighting, killing, burning. The only idea in his mind was to become
the world conqueror.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was going to India, on the way, passing the boundaries of
Greece, he met one of the rarest men in the history of man, Diogenes. He
used to live naked. He was so beautiful, it was perfectly suitable for
him to live naked.</p><p><br></p><p>Clothes serve many purposes, of climate, of culture, but the basic
purpose<span class=s4></span>All the animals can</p><p>manage to live without clothes in every climate all around the world.
What is wrong with man? Is he the most vulnerable and weak animal in the
whole world? No. Clothes were first invented because all people don’t
have beautiful bodies. You know people by their faces. In fact, even you
yourself, if you see a picture of your body naked, without the head, you
will not be able to recognize that this is your body.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes was an immensely beautiful man; he needed no clothes. He
lived by the side of a river. It was early morning and he was taking a
sunbath. He had only one companion, a dog, and only one possession, an
old type of lamp.</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander heard that Diogenes was very close when they were passing
the boundary of Greece. He said, “I have heard so much about the man. He
seems to be a little strange, but I would like to see him.” Alexander
went to see Diogenes – Diogenes was resting. His dog was sitting by his
side. Alexander said to him, “Diogenes, Alexander the Great has come to
see you. It is a great favor, it is unique; I have never gone to see
anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes did not even sit up. He remained lying on the sand, laughed,
looked at his dog and said to the dog, “Have you heard? A man calling
himself great – what do you think about it? He must be suffering from
great inferiority. This is a projection to hide some wound.” It was a
truth. Even Alexander could not deny it.</p><p>Alexander said, “I don’t have much time; otherwise I would have sat
here and listened to some wisdom from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “What is the hurry? Where are you going – to conquer
the world? But have you ever thought, if by chance you succeed in
conquering the world, what will you do then? – because there is no other
world, there is only one world. Right now, fighting, invading, you can
go on forgetting your inferiority; but when you have succeeded, your
inferiority will come back, will surface again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “Returning, I will come and stay for a few days here
and try to understand. Whatsoever you are saying hurts, but it is true.
In fact, just the idea that there is no other world makes me sad. Yes,
if I conquer the whole world, then what am I going to do? Then I will be
just useless, and all that is hidden in me is bound to surface.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Diogenes said, “You will never return, because this kind of
ambition is unending. Nobody comes back.” And strangely, Alexander never
came back. He died while he was coming back, before reaching Greece. And
a beautiful story has been told since then, because the same day
Diogenes also died. It is just a story, but very significant.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a river, according to Greek mythology, which you have to
pass before you enter paradise. Diogenes was just a few feet ahead,
Alexander just behind him. Seeing Diogenes, the same beautiful man,
naked – and now Alexander was also naked, but not with that beauty –
just to cover up, Alexander said, “This is a strange coincidence, the
meeting of a world conqueror with a beggar!”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes laughed and he said, “You are right. Only on one point are
you wrong – you don’t know who is the conqueror and who is the beggar.
Just look at me and look at yourself. I never conquered anybody, yet I
am a conqueror – a conqueror of myself. You tried to conquer the whole
world, and what have you got? Just a sheer wasting of your whole life.
You are just a beggar!”</p><p><br></p><p>The personal power belongs to the mystic – one who has had his flower
of consciousness blossom, who has released his fragrance, his love, his
compassion, far and wide. It is a very subtle power. Nothing can prevent
it; it simply reaches to your heart. It simply makes you fall in tune
with the mystic – into a kind of synchronicity, a harmony. You don’t
become a slave, you become a lover. A great friendliness, a great
gratitude arises in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the presence of the mystic creates an immense aura. In that
aura, whoever is open, available, receptive, immediately starts feeling
like bursting into a song or into a dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Political power is ugly. Power over others is ugly. It is inhuman,
because to have power over somebody means to reduce that person to a
thing. He becomes your possession.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in China, for centuries the husband had the power over
his wife even to kill her. The law allowed it, because the wife was
nothing but a possession – like you possess a chair, and if you want to
destroy it, it is not a crime; it was your chair. And if you kill your
wife, it was your wife<span class=s4></span>For</p><p>centuries no man in China had been punished for having killed his
wife – up to this century.</p><p><br></p><p>Power over anybody reduces the other person’s individuality, reduces
his spirituality, and he becomes just a commodity, a thing. For
centuries men and women have been sold in the markets</p><p>like any other commodity. Once you have purchased a slave, you have
all power over the slave. This may fulfill some insane and sick
psychology, but it is not healthy. No politician is healthy – I mean
spiritually.</p><p><br></p><p>When Nixon was caught bugging and tapping other people’s phones, and
he had finally to resign as the president, Mao Zedong’s remark is
remarkable. He said, “Every politician does it. There is nothing special
in it. Why are they making so much fuss about it? Poor Nixon has just
been caught doing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And even after Nixon’s resignation as president, Mao sent a special
plane, his own plane, to take Nixon to China – to console him, to say
that this is just stupidity. “Whatever you were doing is being done all
over the world. All the politicians are doing it. What was wrong was
being caught. You were an amateur.”</p><p><br></p><p>What politicians are doing all over the world, all through history,
is simply inhuman, ugly. But the reason, the basic reason is that they
have a deep feeling of inferiority, and they want to prove to themselves
that it is not so. “Look, you have so much power, so many people in your
hand you can make or mar, so many nuclear weapons in your hand. Just
push a button and you can destroy the whole planet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Power over others is destructive – always destructive. In a better
world anybody who is ambitious, who wants to be more important than
others, ahead of others, should be treated psychologically. Only
humbleness, simplicity, naturalness – no comparison with anybody<span class=s4></span>Because everybody is</p><p>unique, comparison is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you compare a roseflower with a marigold? How can you say who
is superior and who is inferior? Both have their beauty, and both have
blossomed, danced in the sun, in the wind, in the rain.<span class=s4></span>lived their life totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Every human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior
or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different. Let me remind you of one
thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that
everybody is equal, as communists think. I am absolutely against
communism, for the simple reason that the whole philosophy of communism
is against psychology and against all psychological research.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either.
People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to
contribute my potential to life; you have to contribute your potential
to life. I have to discover my own being; you have to discover your own
being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is perfectly good to be powerful as a mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>It is ugly, disgusting, stinking to have even a slight desire for
having power over others. Question 5</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IN THE PAST, YOU’VE ALWAYS SAID THAT OUR LOVE IS WHAT KEEPS YOU IN
YOUR BODY. IS ALL THIS NEGATIVITY AND EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN HAPPENING
RECENTLY AFFECTING YOU? WILL WE LOSE YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>There is every possibility. Question 6</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>HUMAN NATURE IS TRICKY. IT WILL CREATE A SIMPLE INSTITUTION TO BEGIN
WITH AND THEN TURN IT INTO AN ESTABLISHMENT SO AS TO CONTROL IT AND THE
PEOPLE IT IS THERE TO SERVE. IN SUCH A SITUATION, CAN AN ENLIGHTENED
MASTER CREATE AN INSTITUTION OR A FLEXIBLE, FLUID RELATING, WHERE THE
EMERGENCE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN ORGANIZATION IS NOT POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>And what do you think I am doing here! Question 7</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>THAT’S ALL – THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s great!</p><p><br></p><p>Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IN THE WEST THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS TEACHING SCIENTIFIC MYSTICISM, AND THE PATHS OF TANTRA AND YOGA ARE ALSO VERY SYSTEMATIC. YOUR LITERATURE IS ALSO DEEPLY AND ARTISTICALLY RATIONAL. THERE SEEMS TO EXIST A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RATIONAL SCIENCE AND THE IRRATIONAL RELIGION.\nPLEASE COMMENT.\nTHE BRIDGE IS POSSIBLE – AND THE BRIDGE IS POSSIBLE only because they are diametrically opposite. The gap exists, so the gap can be bridged.\nOpposites can meet, and they can meet only because they are opposites. Opposites attract each other. That’s how the whole life moves, has dynamism. It is through polar opposites: man/woman, yin/yang, matter/mind, the earth and the sky, this and that. There is a constant bridging, but the bridging is possible only because they are opposites. If they are not opposites there is no need for any bridge.\nSo the first thing to be understood: science and religion ARE diametrically opposite, but to bridge them is possible. That bridge will not make them the same. In fact, that bridge will make their diametrical opposition more loud, more clear.\nReligion can have a scientific flavour, it can be systematic, but it never becomes science, it remains mysticism. It takes the garb of a science, the methodology, the terminology of a science, but it remains mysticism, it remains poetry.\nYou can translate poetry into prose; the prose can be translated into poetry. Just by translating prose into poetry you will not make it poetry – it will remain prose. And just by translating poetry into prose, it will NOT become prose, it will remain poetry. Buddha speaks in prose, but what he speaks is poetic.\nI am not a poet. I speak prose, but what I speak is poetic, its soul is poetic. And it remains poetic.\nReligion can use scientific systematization – that’s what Tantra and Yoga have done. Science can also use mysticism as a method to inquire into reality, and all the great scientists HAVE used it, but still it remains science. Its basic trust is in reason. Religion’s basic trust is not in reason. On the periphery religion can become scientific, but at the core it remains irrational. And science, on the periphery, can become very very poetic, but at the core it remains rational.\nAlbert Einstein, or other great scientists, great explorers, are very much like mystics. Their search into reality is almost the same as the search of William Blake into reality. Einstein’s eyes are full of mysticism, but deep down his trust is in reason. Even if he stumbles upon something through his poetic feelings, through his intuition, he will immediately translate it into reason. He will trust it only when it becomes rational.\nAnd just the opposite is the case with a mystic: even if he comes to know something about reality which is very rational, he will transform it into the irrational, he will turn and change it into poetry.\nThey ARE opposites, but they can be bridged – and they are always bridged wherever you can find a contradictory person. But then that man is going to be contradictory. He will speak two languages together and he will speak in contradictions, in paradoxes. All the great scientists are paradoxical, and all the great mystics also.\nA master, whether of science or of religion, is bound to be paradoxical. He cannot be one- dimensional, he has to be in tune with both the realities – but then he becomes very very difficult to understand.\nThat is your problem with me: I talk about the irrational, but I talk rationally about the irrational. I am ALL for the illogical, but my approach? – I slowly slowly persuade you towards the illogical through logic. I ARGUE for it. My argument for the illogical is bound to be logical, because no argument can be illogical in itself – it has to be logical.\nThe other day I mentioned that in old scriptures it has been said that each temple should have at least one maithuna figure on the threshold of the temple – at least one. If it can have many, good. A master is a threshold, a door, an opening. His feet are rooted in the earth and his hands are reaching towards the sky – the master is the bridge between reason and irreason. The master is the bridge between religion and science, between love and logic. A master is a threshold – hence he can convince you, he can use all logical argumentation, and yet his goal remains illogical. Once you are convinced, he throws you into the mysterious. It is a quantum leap.\nI would like to say something more about that ancient tradition:\nMediaeval architects’ manuals, all the manuals in India, make it a rule that all temples must bear maithuna sculpture s on their doorways. ‘Maithuna’ is a Sanskrit word – very pregnant. It does not mean ordinary intercourse, it does not mean an ordinary couple in love – it means UNIO MYSTICA. It means two persons so deeply dissolved into each other that they are no longer two. It is not just a couple making love – it is LOVE, and the couple has disappeared into it. It is a state of being lost into each other, of oneness.\nOther architects’ manuals say that the temple has to be a meeting of the sky and the earth. The earth is visible, logical, material. The sky is vague, nebulous, undefined. The temple has to be a place where the defined meets the undefined. The temple has to be a place where the known meets with the unknown.\nMan is logic, man represents logic, mathematics, sys-tematization, science. Woman is illogic, intuition, feeling, emotion, poetry; vague, undefined and indefinable. The maithuna figure represents this meeting of logic and illogic, of mind and heart, of body and soul – of ALL the pairs of opposites of yin and yang. And when yin and yang meet and merge and become one, a temple is created. Love is the temple: orgasm, that state of orgasmic flow where you don’t know who you are – man or woman – where you don’t know any identity, all identity is lost, when you are in an utter state of forgetfulness AND remembrance... forgetfulness of all that you had known about yourself and remembrance of ALL THAT YOU REALLY ARE, forgetfulness as an ego and remembrance as a whole. That is the meaning of maithuna.\nMaithuna means lovers in a deep state of oneness, in a state of inner marriage – not just the outer marriage. You will be surprised to know that only man can come to that inner marriage – animals can’t. Have you ever seen animals making love? You will never find any ecstasy on their faces, in their eyes, never. Love-making is done as a matter of fact, as a biological phenomenon. They do it almost as a drag.\nBiologists, physiologists, have agreed upon the fact that the female, except in human beings, has not known orgasm at all; no animal female knows orgasm. It is man’s privilege to know orgasm. Orgasm means the inner marriage, even in man.…\nNinety percent of women in the past have not known orgasm – that means they never knew anything about the inner marriage. Their love remained biological. They were used by nature to reproduce, but there was no meditativeness in it. My own observation is this: because of this phenomenon, all the old religions were against sex – because sex represented the animal. But they were not aware that man can transcend sex – and the transcendence can happen only through sex – that man can attain to something inner through the outer. That which is not possible for animals is possible for man. Man can move in an orgasmic state, in an ecstasy, where sex becomes irrelevant, is left behind. Bodies become irrelevant, minds become irrelevant. One plunges into the very depth of being – for a single moment, of course, but God becomes available.\nMaithuna means: love so deep, so tremendously deep, that a glimpse of God becomes available.\nMaithuna means a couple which is no more a couple, a state of being a couple from the outside, but from the inside there is only one – it exists all alone. For a moment the duality is surpassed,\nfor a moment the harmony attained, the accord has happened – hence, orgasm is so relaxing. And Wilhelm Reich is right: if man can become capable of orgasmic joy, then madness, all kinds of neurosis, psychosis, will disappear from the earth.\nThat is the experience of Tantra too. But to put a maithuna figure on the threshold of a temple took great courage. The very step was of deep revolution. Those people must have been courageous; they declared something by it. They said: It is only through love that the polar opposites can be bridged.\nA master is love. A master is in a state of orgasm continuously. He is oneness. His duality is gone. He knows that only one exists. In that state, opposites can be bridged.\nThe couple entwined in deep love stands there on the threshold of the temple in a great ecstasy of oneness: lost, merged: one with something deeper and higher than both.\nYou have to fall in love with a master. The master is a threshold to God. You have to learn how to merge with the master, how to become one with the master. Only through that will you know the bridging.\nThey stand there possessed by the God called Love. And that’s exactly the relationship between a disciple and a master: possessed by deep, immense love. It is non-sexual, it is non-physical – but it is the same that is attained by two lovers. It is the same! The peak is the same. Two lovers move through physiology, through biology; they go through a long way to reach the peak. A disciple and a master reach to that peak immediately. They don’t go roundabout; they don’t pass through the body or the mind. That is the meaning of surrender, or SHRADDHA, or trust.\nTheir love opens the doors of a new perception, a new way of looking at reality. That new way of looking at reality bridges the polar opposites. They are passing from the ordinary to the extraordinary, from prose to poetry, from logic to love, from separation to unity, from the ego to the state of egolessness.\nHave you not seen it happen? Deep in love, the ego disappears. You cannot find it. Hence I insist: while making love, remember always to look once at least when you are reaching to the peak – look in. Is there any ego? And that experience can become a satori.\nOrdinarily you don’t look within. You become so engrossed with the fun of love, with the joy of love, that you forget meditation. If you can remember in that moment when you are dissolving, if you can remember to have a look within, you will never be the same man again. Coming out of love, you will come a totally new man. A new being is born. You will have new ways of perception and new ways of seeing reality.\nOnce seen, that the ego does not exist, you cannot gather that ego again. And even if you gather it, you will know it is false, it is pseudo. Now that understanding has penetrated deep into you.\nThe lovers move from time to timelessness. Observe: when the peak happens, time disappears. For one moment, time stops, the whole world stops, all movement stops. That stopping of all movement and time is what we mean by ‘peak’, the climax, the orgasm.\nTime can stop with a master too. And it stops! – it stops every day here to many people. For moments. You are just in tune with me. You are no more there, I am no more here We both have disappeared. Something exists which is beyond both. You have entered the temple, you have bridged the polar opposite.\nThe reality cannot really be divided; it cannot be divided into logic and love, into time and eternity, into body and soul, into God and matter – it cannot be divided. Although the polar opposites exist, they are not enemies, they are complementaries. They support each other: without the one, the other will not be possible.\nCan you think of poetry if there is no logic left? Or can you think of logic if no love is left? They look opposite, yet deep down somewhere they support, they feed each other, they strengthen each other.\nSo, bridging IS possible, but it always happens through love. It always happens through a threshold. I call the master the threshold.\nIn a moment of love or trust... you are just here and now! the eternal now, the absolute here. You are on the doorway.\nRemember, doorways are openings. Porphyrus wrote: “A threshold is a sacred thing.” A threshold is that which joins the opposites. What is a temple really? A threshold. It joins the world with the beyond; it joins the marketplace with meditation. That’s why the temple exists in the marketplace – it has to exist there.\nThat’s why I insist: Don’t renounce the world – be there! And remaining there, search for the other and you will find it. It is hidden somewhere there in the marketplace. If you listen attentively, to the market noise, you will be surprised – there is hidden music in it! Great music in it! Just drop liking and disliking. Listen attentively. Be en rapport with it. And everywhere in the known you will find the unknown, in the visible the invisible.\nPorphyrus is right when he says a threshold is a sacred thing. A threshold is the boundary between this and that, between two worlds, ordinary, profane space and the sacred world beyond. The threshold is the point where we pass from one mode of being to another, from one level of consciousness to another, from one reality to another kind of reality, from one life to another kind of life. To enter into a temple is symbolic of entering into one’s own depths – or heights. Existentially they mean the same thing. You can call it depth or you can call it height – they mean the same thing. It is the vertical dimension.\nThere are two dimensions: the horizontal and the vertical. The threshold joins these two dimensions. The ordinary profane life is horizontal; the religious life is vertical. Let me remind you about the Christian cross: it is simply a representation of these two dimensions, the horizontal and the vertical. The cross is a beautiful symbol; the cross is a threshold. The cross is a bridge where the horizontal and the vertical meet, where the ordinary and the extraordinary meet.\nAnd obviously, the most natural metaphor for opening and opener can only be the state of love- making. According to another ancient text: “Where cows have sported with bulls, accompanied by\ntheir young ones, or where beautiful women have dallied with their lovers, that place is a appropriate place for a temple.”\nA strange statement. Listen again. You will be shocked, particularly Hindus and Christians and Buddhists – all will be shocked. But this comes from an old Eastern text. It says: “Where cows have sported with bulls, accompanied by their young ones, or where beautiful women have dallied with their lovers, that place is an appropriate site for a temple.”\nStrange, but tremendously significant. That’s how it should be. A temple has to be a meeting, a bridging.\nYou ask: You SAID YESTERDAY THAT SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE.\nYES, THEY ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE, hence they are attracted towards each other as man and woman. They call fall in love. They are complementaries too – all opposites are complementaries too.\nIN THE WEST THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS TEACHING SCIENTIFIC MYSTICISM, AND THE PATHS OF TANTRA AND YOGA ARE ALSO VERY SYSTEMATIC.\nTrue, there is a way to teach scientific mysticism, but mysticism is always going beyond science. That’s what I am doing here! I am teaching you logical illogicalness, scientific mysticism, worldly religiousness.\nRemember it: whenever there is really something happening, there will be the paradox – because the bridge will be needed. But still, mysticism is mysticism, science can be used as a device, but mysticism never becomes scientific. The ultimate flight remains unscientific, transcendental.\nAnd Tantra and Yoga ARE very systematic – but just on the way they are systematic. Once you have followed them long enough, they push you into the chaos, they push you into the chaos of existence where all systems have to be abandoned – because all systems are tiny, because all systems are small prisons made by the mind.\nA prison is very systematic. Have you not seen it? Have you ever gone to a prison? Just go to see... that’s the MOST systematic thing in the world. Your house is not so systematic as the prison – everything is systematic, every-thing follows certain rules, and absolutely. People get up early in the morning at exactly a certain hour, they take their breakfasts, they take their baths, they move almost like robots – everything is systematic.\nIn fact, when everything is too systematic you are imprisoned, freedom is crushed. Freedom needs chaos.\nA strange thing has been observed by psychologists. The strange thing is that in the army people are taught to be very systematic and their goal is to create war, their goal is to create chaos, their goal is death, to kill and to be killed. Their goal is to destroy – their goal is Hiroshima, Nagasaki. But army people are absolutely systematic. The army lives in order to create disorder.Just see the complementariness: the army lives in order to create disorder.\nAnd have you seen another polarity? Artists create order out of disorder, but they live very sloppy, lazy lives, very disorderly lives. If you see an artist living, you will start thinking of committing suicide. Just lousy! No system at all. You can go and see Chaitanya Hari – when he goes to sleep, when he gets up – there is no order. And he creates beautiful music, he creates order.\nArtists create order, hence they have to complement it by disorder in their lives. And army people create disorder, hence they have to complement it by order in their lives. Things move in balance.\nBuddhas talk VERY logically because their goal is illogic. And you can see modern physicists talking very illogically: the theory of relativity is illogic. The theory of uncertainty is illogic. Non-Euclidean geometry is illogic. Higher mathematics is illogic. They talk VERY illogically and they create logic, their goal is logic. They are moving towards order.\nYou will always find this balance happening. Life cannot be one-sided, otherwise it disappears. It needs day and night. summer and winter, birth and death; it needs love and hate\nSo I say: science and religion are diametrically opposite, but I am not saying that bridging is not possible – bridging always happens, continuously is happening. It happens from the side of science, it happens from the side of religion too. And when it happens, you have a great master, a Buddha or an Einstein. Whenever it happens you have the super phenomenon.\nThe second question Question 2\nWON’T YOU SPEAK TO US OF DREAMS? I HAVE TAKEN TO DREAMING I AM DREAMING, OR TO LIVING THROUGH PAINFUL SITUATIONS OF THE PAST OR FUTURE AND DEALING WITH THEM DIFFERENTLY. SOMETIMES I WAKE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT OR AFTER A SHORT SLEEP WITH SUCH A SENSE OF TERROR A VULNERABILITY, I FEEL I AM FIVE YEARS OLD. YOUR PRESENCE IS IN MY DREAM-CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT FAIL, EVERY DREAM SINCE I’VE BEEN HERE. WHAT ARE ALL THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS? I KNOW YOU PLAY DOWN OUR DREAM-LIFE, BUT AREN’T THEY AS MUCH PART OF THE “WHO AM I?” QUEST?\nSAVITA, WHETHER YOU ARE DREAMING or not dreaming, you are dreaming. Whether you are dreaming with closed eyes or open eyes makes no difference. You dream in the night, you dream in the day. There are night-dreams and there are day-dreams. You simply go on changing from one dream to another dream, one kind of dream to another kind of dream.\nListen.You dream in the night, and then abruptly the sleep is broken, then you feel horror – that\ntoo is a dream. Now you are dreaming of horror, of vulnerability, fear. Then you fall asleep again and you start dreaming. And in the morning you open your eyes and you start dreaming with open eyes. Dreams are a continuum. Your mind is made of dreams. Your mind consists of dreams.\nRemember the one who is seeing the dreams. Awake to that witness. Don’t pay much attention to the dreams.\nThat is where the East and West differ. The Western psychology is too much addicted to dreams, dream analysis; one has to go deep into dreams.\nSavita is a therapist, a psychoanalyst, so obviously she must be feeling offended when I put down or play down your dreamlife. Don’t feel offended – this is a totally different approach. By analyzing dreams you will never come to end them. By analyzing dreams you may become a little more understanding about dreams, but awareness is not going to happen through it. By analyzing dreams you may even start dreaming better dreams, but better dreams are just dreams all the same. By analyzing dreams you may start feeling your motivations hidden behind the dreams, your repressed desires, your ambitions, but you will never come to know who you are. How can one come to know who one is by analyzing dreams? Dreams are objects and you are the subject. You have to take a PARAVRITTI – a conversion; you have to move a hundred and eighty degrees. You have to stop paying attention to the dreams; you have to pay attention to the one who has been dreaming.\nThe East is concerned with the witness, not with what it witnesses. You may be seeing a real tree or you may be seeing a dream tree – it makes no difference. For the Eastern approach it makes no difference whether the tree is real or just a dream tree. In both the cases it is the object, in both the cases you are not it. So what difference does it make whether it is there really or you have just imagined it?\nThe only thing that makes any difference is the one, the mirror, in which the tree is reflected – true or untrue, that is irrelevant. But the pool of pure water in you where it is reflected... pay attention, emphasize the witness, go deeper into the witness.\nAnd that’s my purpose here in order to help you – not to analyze your dreams. That you can do in the West in a far more scientific way. The West has become very very skillful in analyzing dreams. But the East was never worried because the East says ALL IS DREAM, SO what is the point of analyzing?\nAnd there is no end. If you go on analyzing and the source that creates the dreams is there, it will go on creating new dreams. They will be coming and coming and coming.That’s why nobody is\never totally psychoanalyzed; there exists not a single person on the earth who is really and totally psychoanalyzed, because the goal of total psychoanalysis is that dreams should disappear. That docs not happen. It didn’t happen even to Freud or Jung. They continued to dream. That means they continued to remain suppressed; that means they continued to remain the same as they were before. Dreams were still coming, because the source had not been radically changed.\nThe projector is working and you go on analyzing the film on the screen, and you go on thinking how to analyze it. And then you differ, your analysis differs; and then there are schools of psychoanalysis. Freud says something, Jung says another thing, Adler still another, and so on and so forth. Now there are as many psychoanalyses as there are psychoanalysts, and everybody has his own opinion, and nobody can really be refuted – because all is dream work,\nWhatsoever you say, if you can say it loudly, convincingly, with authority, with argument, with logic, it appeals TO people – it must be true. And they all seem to be true. ALL those interpretations seem to be true, because no interpretation is of any worth. All interpretations are wrong!\nThe East has a totally different kind of approach: witness – don’t analyze. In analysis you become too much interested, focussed on the dream. Forget the dream: just look at the watcher. That watcher is constant. In the night IT sees dreams; in the day it sees dreams. First you see the\ndream, Savita, and then you are awakened abruptly and you see horror. Then you fall asleep again and you may see a sweet dream, a beautiful dream, a happy dream, or a nightmare again... and this goes on and on. One thing is constant: the seer, the watcher, the witness.\nTurn upon the witness. And that’s what I am trying to say to you – while you are dreaming in the day and when you are dreaming in the night, only one good point about dreams is that you say:\nYOUR PRESENCE IS IN MY DREAM-CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT FAIL, EVERY DREAM SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE.\nThat’s good. At least one thing is constantly there which will help you to fall upon yourself. Emphasize that presence.\nGurdjieff used to say to his disciples, “Make one thing constant in your dreams and sooner or later you will get rid of dreams.” And small things he used to give, small techniques, devices – and they work! To one person he said, “Whenever you dream, just in the dream see that you are raising your hands above your head. And in the daytime also, practise this many times so you become very accustomed and habituated to it, so it becomes almost mechanical, so even in dreams you can raise your hand above your head.”\nAnd the man said, “What will happen?”\nGurdjieff said, “That, when you have become capable, come and tell me.”\nThree months passed and the man continued, day in, day out, walking, eating, whenever he would remember, he would raise his hand, and would remember also, “Tonight am going to raise my hAnd in the dream.”\nAnd then it happened after three months: one night he was dreaming that he was walking on a road and there was much traffic and noise, and suddenly he realized, and he raised his hand above his head – and the dream was broken. And in THAT moment of dream gone, he suddenly saw himself for the first time – the turning, the conversion. It was in the middle of the night. He danced, he was so joyous. And since that day, dreams disappeared.\nAnd when dreams disappear, reality comes closer and closer every day. It is the dreams that are hindering you from seeing that which is.\nWhen he came in the morning to see Gurdjieff, before he had told anything Gurdjieff said, “So it has happened – because I see your eyes have a different, shine, a different light. They have clarity. That dream stuff that used to move behind your eyes is no more there. So it has happened! So you were capable of raising the hand! Now don’t be worried: whenever it comes, again raise the hand.\nEvery possibility is that it may not come again, because at least you have done one thing consciously. Even in y our dream, just a small thing of raising your hand, you remembered a small thing. It was very small, but remembrance is great. You remembered, even in your dream. So the witness has reached there – now no need to worry.”\nI would like to say to Savita: Invite me more and more in your dreams. Let me also enjoy your dreams. Go every night with a very conscious feeling that I will be there in your dreams. Make it an alert effort, deliberate, and one day it is going to happen. It will not be just a dreamlike phenomenon. I will be really as present as I am now, or even more, because right now I can see there are dreams in Savita’s eyes. If in your dream you can see me as I am even for a single moment, all dreaming will disappear.\nAnalysis is to no point. Dreams have to go. When dreams are gone, reality comes in. By one door, dreams go out; from another door the reality enters in. And reality is silent, quiet, peaceful, blissful.…\nThe third question Question 3\nWHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DYING WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE? IS FALLING IN LOVE A SUICIDAL DESIRE? OR JUST A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCT LIKE THE LEMMINGS’ MARCH TO THE SEA OR A MOTH’S FLIGHT INTO A FLAME? IT’S WEIRD.\nLOVE is DEATH, but the one who dies in love has never existed really. It is the unreal self, the idea of an ego, that dies.\nSo love is death, it is suicide, it is dangerous. That’s why millions of people have decided against love. They live a loveless life. They have decided in favour of the ego – but ego is false. And you can go on clinging to the false and the false will never become real. So the life of an egoist always remains in insecurity. How can you make something unreal real? It is always disappearing. You have to cling to it, you have to constantly create it again and again. It is a self-deception. And it creates misery.\nMisery is the function of the unreal. The real is blissful – SATCHITANAND. The truth is blissful, and the truth is awareness. SAT means truth, CHIT means consciousness, ANAND means bliss. These three things are the qualities of truth. It is so, it is alert, and it is blissful.\nUnreality is misery. Hell is that which does not exist but you create, and heaven is that which exists but you don’t accept. Paradise is where you really are, but you are not courageous enough to move into it. And hell is your private creation. But because it is your creation, you cling to it.\nMan has never left God. He lives in God, but still suffers because he creates a small hell around himself. Heaven need not be created – it is already there; you have to relax and enjoy it. Hell has to be created.\nTake life in a relaxed mood. There is no need to create anything, and there is no need to protect anything, and there is no need to cling to anything. That which is will whether you cling to it or not, and that which is not cannot remain whether you cling to it or not. That which is not is not, and that which is is.\nYou ask: WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DYING WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE?\nBecause the ego, the unreal, dies. Love opens the door to the real. Love is the threshold of the temple. Love opens you towards God. It brings great joy, but simultaneously it brings great fear: your ego is disappearing. And you have invested so much in the ego. You have LIVED for it, you have been taught and conditioned for it. Your parents, your priests, your politicians, your education, your school, college, university, they have all been creating your ego. They have been creating ambition; they are factories to create ambition. And one day you find yourself crippled by your own ambitions, caged by your own ego. You suffer much, but the whole life you have been taught that this is valuable, so you cling to it – you suffer and you cling to it. And the more you cling, the more you suffer.\nThere are moments when God comes and knocks at your door. That’s what love is – God knocking at your door. Maybe through a woman, through a man, through a child, through a love, through a flower, through sunset, sunrise... God can knock in millions of ways. But wherever God knocks, you become afraid. The priest, the politician, the parent, and the created ego – it is at stake. It starts feeling that it is dying. You pull back. You hold back. You close your eyes, you close your ears; you don’t hear the knock. You disappear back into your hole. You close your doors.\nLove feels like death – it is. And those who want to be really blissful have to go through that death, because the resurrection is possible only through death.\nJesus is right when he says you will have to carry your cross on your shoulders. You will have to die. He says, “Unless you are reborn, you will not see my Kingdom, you will not see what I am teaching to you.” And he says, “Love is God.” He is right because love is the threshold.\nDie in love. It is far more beautiful than to live in ego. It is far more true than to live in the ego. Life in the ego is death in love. Death in the ego is life in love. Remember: when you choose ego, you are choosing real death – because it is death in love. And when you choose love you are only choosing unreal death, because to die in ego you are not losing anything – you had nothing from the very beginning.\nThat is the whole emphasis of Ikkyu’s DOKA yesterday. You are not, so why be afraid? Who is going to die? There is nobody to die! To whom are you clinging? Whom do you want to make safe? Whom do you want to protect and armour? There is nobody. There is only emptiness... emptiness... utter emptiness.\nListen to Ikkyu’s song. Accept this emptiness and the fear will disappear. Be a moth when you find the flame of love burning bright – be a moth! Jump into it... and you will lose the false and you will gain the real; and you will lose dreams and you will gain the ultimate. You will lose something which was not there and you will gain something which has always been there.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nWHY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN MAN AND WESTERN WOMAN NOT SUCCESSFUL? IT ALWAYS BREAKS AT SOME POINT. WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM WHICH COMES IN, WHICH STOPS THE RELATIONSHIP FROM GROWING MATURE? PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.\nVEDANT BHARTI, all relationships break at some point – have to break. You cannot make your house on the threshold, you should not. Love is a door: pass through it. Pass, certainly, don’t avoid it. If you avoid it you will miss the deity in the temple. But you should not make your house on the threshold, at the door. Don’t remain there.\nThe door is just an opening. You have to move!\nLove relationship is a must, but not the destiny, not the end – only the beginning. I am all for love. But remember: love is something that has to be transcended too.\nThere are two types of people – both go neurotic. One type is those who are so much afraid of love because they are afraid of dying. They cling to the ego. They avoid love. They may call it religion, but it can’t be religion – it is just sheer ego and nothing else. That’s why the monks – the Catholic, the Hindu, the Buddhist – they have such stronger egos, subtle but very strong, hidden but very strong. The humbleness is only superficial, is just a sugar coating on the poisonous ego. They have pious egos, but egos are there. And a pious ego is more dangerous than an ordinary ego – because the ordinary ego is apparent, you can’t hide it. But the pious ego is very hidden and you can carry it in subtle ways for ever and ever.\nSo this creates one kind of neurosis: people avoid love and they think they are going towards God. You can’t go because you have avoided the door itself.\nThen there is another kind of neurosis: seeing the beauty of love, taking the courage to jump into it, dissolving the ego for a few moments... because in love it can only be for a few moments. The ecstasy of love cannot be eternal, because it is ecstasy between two parts meeting, dissolving into each other. Unless you dissolve with the whole you can’t have eternal ecstasy. Dissolving with the part – with a man, with a woman – you will be dissolving only in a very small drop of God. It can’t be oceanic. Yes, for a moment you will have the taste, and then the taste disappears. This creates another kind of neurosis: people cling to love affairs. If love dies with one woman, they change to another woman, another man; they go on and on. They start living on the threshold. They have forgotten the deity, they have forgotten about the temple. Love has to be transcended into prayer.\nNever be in the neurosis of the first kind, and never cling to the second kind of neurosis. Go on... move on.\nA great emperor, Akbar, created a small, beautiful capital in India. It was never used because before it was completed Akbar died. So his capital was never transferred to it from Delhi. The place’s name is Fatehpur Sikri. It is one of the most beautiful towns ever planned – and never used by any man.\nEvery small detail was looked into. Great architects of those days were consulted, great masters were consulted. Akbar asked all the great teachers in India of those days to give him a small sentence which could be written on the door, the passage. A bridge led to Fatehpur Sikri – a river had to be crossed and Akbar had made a beautiful gate on the bridge. Some Sufi suggested a saying of Jesus, and he loved it. Many sayings were suggested, but He loved it and that saying was written on the door. That saying is beautiful. It doesn’t exist in the Bible; it has come from another oral source. It says: Life is a bridge – pass through it, but don’t make your house on it.\nLove is also a bridge – pass through it.\nSo no love affair EVER succeeds. Gives you hope, gives you great hope, but always ends in frustration. That frustration is in-built; just as the ecstasy is in-built, so is the frustration. In the beginning it is ecstasy, in the end it is frustration. That frustration will lead you to go beyond, otherwise how will you go beyond? When will you search for the real deity in the temple if you cling to the door? If you think, “The door is enough and I am contented,” then nobody will ever move.\nJesus says man reaches to God through love, love is God – but this is only half of the truth. The other half is: man never reaches through love – man reaches only by transcending love. When both are understood together, you have understood the phenomenon of love. Love is God and love is not God. In the beginning it is, in the end it is not. In the beginning it brings ecstasy, those honeymoon days, and then the frustration, the boredom that every marriage ends in.\nJust think of two persons sitting together, bored. All has been explored and there is nothing to explore any more. This is the moment! Either you can start looking for another man, another woman, or you can start looking beyond love.\nYou have lived love, you have seen its beauties and you have seen its uglinesses; you have seen its joy, you have seen its misery; you have seen its heaven and its hell. It is not pure heaven, no; otherwise nobody will ever go to God. t is pure heaven and pure hell – it is both. Hell and heaven are two aspects of it. In the beginning hope and in the end frustration.\nPassing through that hope and that frustration again and again, one day the understanding arises, “What am I doing on the threshold? I have to go beyond!” And not out of anger but out of understanding one goes beyond.\nSo the first thing: no relationship ever succeeds. And it is fortunate that no relationship ever succeeds – otherwise, when will you relate to God? Why should you think of God? Man thinks of God because love gives a glimpse. Man thinks of God because love gives hope. And man HAS to think about God because love gives frustration. All hopes turn into hopelessness.\nWithout love there will be no search for God because man will not have any experience of hope and meaning and significance and grandeur. Love gives you a glimpse of the beyond... don’t cling to it. Take the hint of it, and search for something more, go on searching. Use love as a stepping-stone.\nYou ask: WHY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN MAN AND WESTERN WOMAN NOT SUCCESSFUL?\nSo first thing: no relationship is successful, whether between Indian man and Western woman, or Western man and Western woman, or Indian man and Indian woman. It can’t succeed; its very nature prohibits it. It feels it is succeeding, but it never succeeds. It comes very very close to success, but it never comes exactly to the point. It takes you on great journeys, but it never supplies the goal. It keeps your hope aflame, but just hope. But good, at least it takes you to the threshold. One step has been taken; half the journey is complete, but half the journey still remains.\nAnd the second thing: it is more difficult between an Indian man and a Western woman, or a Western man and an Indian woman. The problem is not between man and woman, the problem is between Eastern and Western. Man and woman are just man and Woman; East and West make no difference. But the minds are there. Those minds create trouble.\nThe Indian has one kind of mind and the West has evolved a different kind of mind. So when an Indian man is with a Western woman, or vice versa, there is no communication. They don’t speak the same language. It is not only that they don’t speak the same language – English, German or French or Italian – they may speak the same language, still they don’t speak the same language, because they have different kinds of minds. Their expectations are different, their conditioning is different. The Indian man says one thing and the Western woman understands another thing. The woman says one thing and the Indian man understands something else. Unless they drop the minds, unless they become pure man and woman, there will be great difficulty.\nAnd Vedant Bharti must be asking this question out of his own experience. One night, eavesdropping on Vedant Bharti, I heard this dialogue:\nVedant Bharti: “Oh, my gorgeous, sweetest darling! Am I the first man you’ve ever been to bed with?”\nAnd the American girl: “Of course you are! Why do all you Indians always ask the same stupid question?”\nDifferent mindsThe Indian mind is very male chauvinistic. The Western woman is now a liberated\nwoman; she lives in a totally different kind of milieu. She is not the woman you have lived with for centuries in India. It can’t be possible now to possess a Western woman; she is no longer property – she is as free as you are.\nIn India, the woman has been taken as property; man can possess her. Not only ordinary man – even great men in India think of woman as a possession. You may have heard the famous story of Mahabharata. Yudhishthira, one of the very famous men in Indian history – and has been thought to be very religious, he is known as DHARMARAJ, a religious king, or a king of religion – playing, gambling, he even staked his wife. He gambled her, because it was thought that your wife is your property. He staked his kingdom, he staked his treasury, he staked everything; then only the wife was left – he staked the wife too. And still in India he is thought to be one of the greatest religious men. What kind of religious man is this? Just to think of staking an alive person, gambling? But in India the woman has been thought of as property; you are the possessor, and the whole and sole possessor.\nIn the West that slavery is no more, it has disappeared. It is good. It has to disappear from India too. Nobody can possess anybody, man or woman. NO person can be possessed; no person can be reduced to property! This is ugly, this is sin! What can be a greater sin than this?\nYou can love a person, but you cannot possess. The love that possesses is not love – it is ego.\nIn India, the man is very male chauvinistic. And the Indian woman has not yet asserted her freedom. There exists nothing like the lib movement in India. The woman still goes on living in the same way.\nSo when an Indian falls in love with a Western woman, the problem arises – he starts possessing. And the Indian mind is very much obsessed with sex; that too creates a problem. You will be surprised when I say the Indian mind is very much obsessed with sex, because you think India is very religious and moral. Yes, it is, but its morality and religion are all so much based on repression that deep down is the obsession with sex.\nIf your woman just holds somebody else’s hands, the husband is mad. Just holding hands! Holding hands can be just a simple gesture of friendship. There is no need to give any sexual colour to it, but the Indian man cannot think that. If his woman is holding hands with somebody else, that means she is sexually relating to somebody else. He will be in a rage. He will not be able to sleep. He would like to kill the man or the woman or himself. Something has gone very wrong.\nIn the West things are looked at in a different way. One can hold somebody’s hand just as a sheer gesture of friendship, of lovingness, of sharing. It need not have any sexual overtone to it. Or, even if it has, it is nobody else’s business. It is the person’s freedom. A person has to decide his life, how to live, with whom to live. Nobody else can be the decisive factor, but that creates problems.\nJust listen to this: in the West sex is not so important as people in the East think it is. Sex has almost become a sharing of energy, a loving play with each other, a fun. It no longer has that seriousness that it used to have in the past. In India it is still very very serious. And when something is serious, remember, ego must be involved in it. Ego is always serious; it makes everything serious. And whenever something is playful, that simply shows ego is no more involved in it. And ALL playfulness is good because it is liberation.\nWhen you fall in love... if all Indian falls in love – and here it is going to happen again and again – when an Indian falls in love, he is falling very seriously. That is the trouble. And the woman may not think it serious at all. She may think it is for the moment. You appeal to her – for the moment. There is no commitment in it; there is no tomorrow to it. But the Indian mind is bringing not only tomorrow – the whole life. Or there are people who even think of other lives in the future. Those are hidden sources; you don’t talk about them, but the clash is going to happen.\nShe has fallen in love with you because she enjoys loving; it is a beautiful experience. She has not fallen in love with you in particular – she is in love with love itself. That is the difference. You are not in love with love itself – you are falling in love with this particular woman. It is a life-death problem for you. If tomorrow she starts moving with somebody else, you will be mad. But you misunderstood. It was a gesture of the moment.\nThe American girl had just returned to New York from a holiday in England and was talking to her best friend.\n“Mabel, I’ve been thinking about Keith ever since I left England. Now I’m back home and I don’t think I should write to him as our friendship was only slight.”\n“But, Wendy, you promised to marry him!” “I know, but that was all.”\nMarriage no longer has that seriousness that it has in the East. Marriage is just a kind of friendship – nothing special about it.\nIf you don’t understand these different minds it is going to be a difficult problem, communication will not be possible. Man in the East has always enjoyed freedom – mm? – they say “Boys are boys.” But the woman has not been given any freedom. In the West now there is no discrimination. Man\nor woman – both are free. And whatsoever man has been doing, now woman is also doing, it; she has every right to do it.\nIn the East we played a trick. The trick was that we placed woman very high on a great pedestal; we worshipped woman. That was a trick to imprison her. We satisfied her ego through worship. We said, “A woman is a goddess, a woman is purity. A woman is not of this earth. A woman has to be virgin before marriage and then she has to remain monogamous for the whole of her life.” And we gave to much respect for this, and we conditioned the women so much for this, that they became addicted to the ego, and they remained on the pedestal. Imprisoned there, chains there! And man was enjoying all kinds of freedom. Boys are boys.…\nThe woman in the West has come down from the pedestal. She says, “Either you also come up on the pedestal or I am coming down. We both have to exist on the same ground.” And that’s how it should be.\n“I say, old man,” said Clive to the host of the party, ’there’s this rather delectable young chick whom I’m getting along with really well, if you know what I mean.”\nHe walked and continued, “And I wondered if I might use your spare bedroom for a short while.” “No, I don’t mind,” replied the host. “But what about your wife?”\n“Oh, don’t bother about her,” said Clive. “I’ll only be gone a short time and I’m sure she won’t miss me.”\n“I KNOW she won’t miss you,” stated the host. “It’s only five minutes ago that SHE borrowed the spare bedroom!”\nThe male ego has never allowed that to happen. It has allowed itself all kinds of freedom; it has not allowed that freedom to the woman. Now things have changed in the West. Man and woman are standing on the same plane as human beings. The woman is no more a goddess, and she does not pretend and she does not WANT to pretend.\nBut the Indian mind is very much clouded by the past.\nIf you drop these minds, if you are just a man and a woman, then there is no problem. The problems arise out of the Indian mind and the Chinese mind and the American mind – if you drop the minds then there are no problems. Then love can flow, and you can grow through it.\nBut still remember: no love can be ultimate satisfying. It can go a LONG way but it cannot go the whole way. Finally you have to go beyond it. Learn how to love by loving people, then one day use that learning to fall in love with the whole, with existence itself. Only that day have you come home.\nThe last question Question 5\nNOTHING GOOD, NOTHING BAD. NOTHING TO GAIN, NOTHING TO LOSE. TAKE IT EASY. WITH THIS AS A REFERENCE, PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EPICUREAN HEDONIST AND A ZEN BUDDHIST.\nTHERE IS NONE. The Zen Buddhist knows it, the Epicurean hedonist does not know it. That’s the only difference – otherwise there is none.\nBetween the enlightened person and the unenlightened person there is no difference at all, not even a single inch’s difference. The enlightened person KNOWS it, the un-enlightened person does not know about it – that’s all. The unenlightened person believes in the distance, in the difference, hence he creates IT. The enlightened person has come to know there is no difference. The belief has disappeared.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8969","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_1/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_1/>Take It Easy, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Death in the Ego is Life in Love</h1><div class=post-meta>43 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8969 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Take_It_Easy_Vol_1/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OPPOSITE. IN THE WEST THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS TEACHING SCIENTIFIC
MYSTICISM, AND THE PATHS OF TANTRA AND YOGA ARE ALSO VERY SYSTEMATIC.
YOUR LITERATURE IS ALSO DEEPLY AND ARTISTICALLY RATIONAL. THERE SEEMS TO
EXIST A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RATIONAL SCIENCE AND THE IRRATIONAL
RELIGION.</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>THE BRIDGE IS POSSIBLE – AND THE BRIDGE IS POSSIBLE only because they
are diametrically opposite. The gap exists, so the gap can be
bridged.</p><p><br></p><p>Opposites can meet, and they can meet only because they are
opposites. Opposites attract each other. That’s how the whole life
moves, has dynamism. It is through polar opposites: man/woman, yin/yang,
matter/mind, the earth and the sky, this and that. There is a constant
bridging, but the bridging is possible only because they are opposites.
If they are not opposites there is no need for any bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be understood: science and religion ARE
diametrically opposite, but to bridge them is possible. That bridge will
not make them the same. In fact, that bridge will make their diametrical
opposition more loud, more clear.</p><p>Religion can have a scientific flavour, it can be systematic, but it
never becomes science, it remains mysticism. It takes the garb of a
science, the methodology, the terminology of a science, but it remains
mysticism, it remains poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>You can translate poetry into prose; the prose can be translated into
poetry. Just by translating prose into poetry you will not make it
poetry – it will remain prose. And just by translating poetry into
prose, it will NOT become prose, it will remain poetry. Buddha speaks in
prose, but what he speaks is poetic.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a poet. I speak prose, but what I speak is poetic, its soul
is poetic. And it remains poetic.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion can use scientific systematization – that’s what Tantra and
Yoga have done. Science can also use mysticism as a method to inquire
into reality, and all the great scientists HAVE used it, but still it
remains science. Its basic trust is in reason. Religion’s basic trust is
not in reason. On the periphery religion can become scientific, but at
the core it remains irrational. And science, on the periphery, can
become very very poetic, but at the core it remains rational.</p><p><br></p><p>Albert Einstein, or other great scientists, great explorers, are very
much like mystics. Their search into reality is almost the same as the
search of William Blake into reality. Einstein’s eyes are full of
mysticism, but deep down his trust is in reason. Even if he stumbles
upon something through his poetic feelings, through his intuition, he
will immediately translate it into reason. He will trust it only when it
becomes rational.</p><p><br></p><p>And just the opposite is the case with a mystic: even if he comes to
know something about reality which is very rational, he will transform
it into the irrational, he will turn and change it into poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>They ARE opposites, but they can be bridged – and they are always
bridged wherever you can find a contradictory person. But then that man
is going to be contradictory. He will speak two languages together and
he will speak in contradictions, in paradoxes. All the great scientists
are paradoxical, and all the great mystics also.</p><p><br></p><p>A master, whether of science or of religion, is bound to be
paradoxical. He cannot be one- dimensional, he has to be in tune with
both the realities – but then he becomes very very difficult to
understand.</p><p><br></p><p>That is your problem with me: I talk about the irrational, but I talk
rationally about the irrational. I am ALL for the illogical, but my
approach? – I slowly slowly persuade you towards the illogical through
logic. I ARGUE for it. My argument for the illogical is bound to be
logical, because no argument can be illogical in itself – it has to be
logical.</p><p><br></p><p>The other day I mentioned that in old scriptures it has been said
that each temple should have at least one maithuna figure on the
threshold of the temple – at least one. If it can have many, good. A
master is a threshold, a door, an opening. His feet are rooted in the
earth and his hands are reaching towards the sky – the master is the
bridge between reason and irreason. The master is the bridge between
religion and science, between love and logic. A master is a threshold –
hence he can convince you, he can use all logical argumentation, and yet
his goal remains illogical. Once you are convinced, he throws you into
the mysterious. It is a quantum leap.</p><p>I would like to say something more about that ancient tradition:</p><p><br></p><p>Mediaeval architects’ manuals, all the manuals in India, make it a
rule that all temples must bear maithuna sculpture s on their doorways.
‘Maithuna’ is a Sanskrit word – very pregnant. It does not mean ordinary
intercourse, it does not mean an ordinary couple in love – it means UNIO
MYSTICA. It means two persons so deeply dissolved into each other that
they are no longer two. It is not just a couple making love – it is
LOVE, and the couple has disappeared into it. It is a state of being
lost into each other, of oneness.</p><p><br></p><p>Other architects’ manuals say that the temple has to be a meeting of
the sky and the earth. The earth is visible, logical, material. The sky
is vague, nebulous, undefined. The temple has to be a place where the
defined meets the undefined. The temple has to be a place where the
known meets with the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is logic, man represents logic, mathematics, sys-tematization,
science. Woman is illogic, intuition, feeling, emotion, poetry; vague,
undefined and indefinable. The maithuna figure represents this meeting
of logic and illogic, of mind and heart, of body and soul – of ALL the
pairs of opposites of yin and yang. And when yin and yang meet and merge
and become one, a temple is created. Love is the temple: orgasm, that
state of orgasmic flow where you don’t know who you are – man or woman –
where you don’t know any identity, all identity is lost, when you are in
an utter state of forgetfulness AND remembrance... forgetfulness of all
that you had known about yourself and remembrance of ALL THAT YOU REALLY
ARE, forgetfulness as an ego and remembrance as a whole. That is the
meaning of maithuna.</p><p><br></p><p>Maithuna means lovers in a deep state of oneness, in a state of inner
marriage – not just the outer marriage. You will be surprised to know
that only man can come to that inner marriage – animals can’t. Have you
ever seen animals making love? You will never find any ecstasy on their
faces, in their eyes, never. Love-making is done as a matter of fact, as
a biological phenomenon. They do it almost as a drag.</p><p><br></p><p>Biologists, physiologists, have agreed upon the fact that the female,
except in human beings, has not known orgasm at all; no animal female
knows orgasm. It is man’s privilege to know orgasm. Orgasm means the
inner marriage, even in man.…</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety percent of women in the past have not known orgasm – that
means they never knew anything about the inner marriage. Their love
remained biological. They were used by nature to reproduce, but there
was no meditativeness in it. My own observation is this: because of this
phenomenon, all the old religions were against sex – because sex
represented the animal. But they were not aware that man can transcend
sex – and the transcendence can happen only through sex – that man can
attain to something inner through the outer. That which is not possible
for animals is possible for man. Man can move in an orgasmic state, in
an ecstasy, where sex becomes irrelevant, is left behind. Bodies become
irrelevant, minds become irrelevant. One plunges into the very depth of
being – for a single moment, of course, but God becomes available.</p><p><br></p><p>Maithuna means: love so deep, so tremendously deep, that a glimpse of
God becomes available.</p><p><br></p><p>Maithuna means a couple which is no more a couple, a state of being a
couple from the outside, but from the inside there is only one – it
exists all alone. For a moment the duality is surpassed,</p><p>for a moment the harmony attained, the accord has happened – hence,
orgasm is so relaxing. And Wilhelm Reich is right: if man can become
capable of orgasmic joy, then madness, all kinds of neurosis, psychosis,
will disappear from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the experience of Tantra too. But to put a maithuna figure on
the threshold of a temple took great courage. The very step was of deep
revolution. Those people must have been courageous; they declared
something by it. They said: It is only through love that the polar
opposites can be bridged.</p><p><br></p><p>A master is love. A master is in a state of orgasm continuously. He
is oneness. His duality is gone. He knows that only one exists. In that
state, opposites can be bridged.</p><p><br></p><p>The couple entwined in deep love stands there on the threshold of the
temple in a great ecstasy of oneness: lost, merged: one with something
deeper and higher than both.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to fall in love with a master. The master is a threshold to
God. You have to learn how to merge with the master, how to become one
with the master. Only through that will you know the bridging.</p><p><br></p><p>They stand there possessed by the God called Love. And that’s exactly
the relationship between a disciple and a master: possessed by deep,
immense love. It is non-sexual, it is non-physical – but it is the same
that is attained by two lovers. It is the same! The peak is the same.
Two lovers move through physiology, through biology; they go through a
long way to reach the peak. A disciple and a master reach to that peak
immediately. They don’t go roundabout; they don’t pass through the body
or the mind. That is the meaning of surrender, or SHRADDHA, or
trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Their love opens the doors of a new perception, a new way of looking
at reality. That new way of looking at reality bridges the polar
opposites. They are passing from the ordinary to the extraordinary, from
prose to poetry, from logic to love, from separation to unity, from the
ego to the state of egolessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not seen it happen? Deep in love, the ego disappears. You
cannot find it. Hence I insist: while making love, remember always to
look once at least when you are reaching to the peak – look in. Is there
any ego? And that experience can become a satori.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily you don’t look within. You become so engrossed with the
fun of love, with the joy of love, that you forget meditation. If you
can remember in that moment when you are dissolving, if you can remember
to have a look within, you will never be the same man again. Coming out
of love, you will come a totally new man. A new being is born. You will
have new ways of perception and new ways of seeing reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Once seen, that the ego does not exist, you cannot gather that ego
again. And even if you gather it, you will know it is false, it is
pseudo. Now that understanding has penetrated deep into you.</p><p><br></p><p>The lovers move from time to timelessness. Observe: when the peak
happens, time disappears. For one moment, time stops, the whole world
stops, all movement stops. That stopping of all movement and time is
what we mean by ‘peak’, the climax, the orgasm.</p><p>Time can stop with a master too. And it stops! – it stops every day
here to many people. For moments. You are just in tune with me. You are
no more there, I am no more here We both have disappeared. Something
exists which is beyond both. You have entered the temple, you have
bridged the polar opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality cannot really be divided; it cannot be divided into logic
and love, into time and eternity, into body and soul, into God and
matter – it cannot be divided. Although the polar opposites exist, they
are not enemies, they are complementaries. They support each other:
without the one, the other will not be possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you think of poetry if there is no logic left? Or can you think
of logic if no love is left? They look opposite, yet deep down somewhere
they support, they feed each other, they strengthen each other.</p><p><br></p><p>So, bridging IS possible, but it always happens through love. It
always happens through a threshold. I call the master the threshold.</p><p><br></p><p>In a moment of love or trust... you are just here and now! the
eternal now, the absolute here. You are on the doorway.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, doorways are openings. Porphyrus wrote: “A threshold is a
sacred thing.” A threshold is that which joins the opposites. What is a
temple really? A threshold. It joins the world with the beyond; it joins
the marketplace with meditation. That’s why the temple exists in the
marketplace – it has to exist there.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I insist: Don’t renounce the world – be there! And
remaining there, search for the other and you will find it. It is hidden
somewhere there in the marketplace. If you listen attentively, to the
market noise, you will be surprised – there is hidden music in it! Great
music in it! Just drop liking and disliking. Listen attentively. Be en
rapport with it. And everywhere in the known you will find the unknown,
in the visible the invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>Porphyrus is right when he says a threshold is a sacred thing. A
threshold is the boundary between this and that, between two worlds,
ordinary, profane space and the sacred world beyond. The threshold is
the point where we pass from one mode of being to another, from one
level of consciousness to another, from one reality to another kind of
reality, from one life to another kind of life. To enter into a temple
is symbolic of entering into one’s own depths – or heights.
Existentially they mean the same thing. You can call it depth or you can
call it height – they mean the same thing. It is the vertical
dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two dimensions: the horizontal and the vertical. The
threshold joins these two dimensions. The ordinary profane life is
horizontal; the religious life is vertical. Let me remind you about the
Christian cross: it is simply a representation of these two dimensions,
the horizontal and the vertical. The cross is a beautiful symbol; the
cross is a threshold. The cross is a bridge where the horizontal and the
vertical meet, where the ordinary and the extraordinary meet.</p><p><br></p><p>And obviously, the most natural metaphor for opening and opener can
only be the state of love- making. According to another ancient text:
“Where cows have sported with bulls, accompanied by</p><p>their young ones, or where beautiful women have dallied with their
lovers, that place is a appropriate place for a temple.”</p><p><br></p><p>A strange statement. Listen again. You will be shocked, particularly
Hindus and Christians and Buddhists – all will be shocked. But this
comes from an old Eastern text. It says: “Where cows have sported with
bulls, accompanied by their young ones, or where beautiful women have
dallied with their lovers, that place is an appropriate site for a
temple.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange, but tremendously significant. That’s how it should be. A
temple has to be a meeting, a bridging.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: You SAID YESTERDAY THAT SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE
DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE.</p><p><br></p><p>YES, THEY ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE, hence they are attracted
towards each other as man and woman. They call fall in love. They are
complementaries too – all opposites are complementaries too.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE WEST THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS TEACHING SCIENTIFIC MYSTICISM, AND
THE PATHS OF TANTRA AND YOGA ARE ALSO VERY SYSTEMATIC.</p><p><br></p><p>True, there is a way to teach scientific mysticism, but mysticism is
always going beyond science. That’s what I am doing here! I am teaching
you logical illogicalness, scientific mysticism, worldly
religiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it: whenever there is really something happening, there will
be the paradox – because the bridge will be needed. But still, mysticism
is mysticism, science can be used as a device, but mysticism never
becomes scientific. The ultimate flight remains unscientific,
transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>And Tantra and Yoga ARE very systematic – but just on the way they
are systematic. Once you have followed them long enough, they push you
into the chaos, they push you into the chaos of existence where all
systems have to be abandoned – because all systems are tiny, because all
systems are small prisons made by the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>A prison is very systematic. Have you not seen it? Have you ever gone
to a prison? Just go to see... that’s the MOST systematic thing in the
world. Your house is not so systematic as the prison – everything is
systematic, every-thing follows certain rules, and absolutely. People
get up early in the morning at exactly a certain hour, they take their
breakfasts, they take their baths, they move almost like robots –
everything is systematic.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, when everything is too systematic you are imprisoned,
freedom is crushed. Freedom needs chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>A strange thing has been observed by psychologists. The strange thing
is that in the army people are taught to be very systematic and their
goal is to create war, their goal is to create chaos, their goal is
death, to kill and to be killed. Their goal is to destroy – their goal
is Hiroshima, Nagasaki. But army people are absolutely systematic. The
army lives in order to create disorder.Just see the complementariness:
the army lives in order to create disorder.</p><p>And have you seen another polarity? Artists create order out of
disorder, but they live very sloppy, lazy lives, very disorderly lives.
If you see an artist living, you will start thinking of committing
suicide. Just lousy! No system at all. You can go and see Chaitanya Hari
– when he goes to sleep, when he gets up – there is no order. And he
creates beautiful music, he creates order.</p><p><br></p><p>Artists create order, hence they have to complement it by disorder in
their lives. And army people create disorder, hence they have to
complement it by order in their lives. Things move in balance.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas talk VERY logically because their goal is illogic. And you
can see modern physicists talking very illogically: the theory of
relativity is illogic. The theory of uncertainty is illogic.
Non-Euclidean geometry is illogic. Higher mathematics is illogic. They
talk VERY illogically and they create logic, their goal is logic. They
are moving towards order.</p><p><br></p><p>You will always find this balance happening. Life cannot be
one-sided, otherwise it disappears. It needs day and night. summer and
winter, birth and death; it needs love and hate</p><p><br></p><p>So I say: science and religion are diametrically opposite, but I am
not saying that bridging is not possible – bridging always happens,
continuously is happening. It happens from the side of science, it
happens from the side of religion too. And when it happens, you have a
great master, a Buddha or an Einstein. Whenever it happens you have the
super phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>WON’T YOU SPEAK TO US OF DREAMS? I HAVE TAKEN TO DREAMING I AM
DREAMING, OR TO LIVING THROUGH PAINFUL SITUATIONS OF THE PAST OR FUTURE
AND DEALING WITH THEM DIFFERENTLY. SOMETIMES I WAKE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
OR AFTER A SHORT SLEEP WITH SUCH A SENSE OF TERROR A VULNERABILITY, I
FEEL I AM FIVE YEARS OLD. YOUR PRESENCE IS IN MY DREAM-CONSCIOUSNESS
WITHOUT FAIL, EVERY DREAM SINCE I’VE BEEN HERE. WHAT ARE ALL THESE NEW
DEVELOPMENTS? I KNOW YOU PLAY DOWN OUR DREAM-LIFE, BUT AREN’T THEY AS
MUCH PART OF THE “WHO AM I?” QUEST?</p><p><br></p><p>SAVITA, WHETHER YOU ARE DREAMING or not dreaming, you are dreaming.
Whether you are dreaming with closed eyes or open eyes makes no
difference. You dream in the night, you dream in the day. There are
night-dreams and there are day-dreams. You simply go on changing from
one dream to another dream, one kind of dream to another kind of
dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen.<span class=s4></span>You dream in the night, and then
abruptly the sleep is broken, then you feel horror – that</p><p>too is a dream. Now you are dreaming of horror, of vulnerability,
fear. Then you fall asleep again and you start dreaming. And in the
morning you open your eyes and you start dreaming with open eyes. Dreams
are a continuum. Your mind is made of dreams. Your mind consists of
dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the one who is seeing the dreams. Awake to that witness.
Don’t pay much attention to the dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>That is where the East and West differ. The Western psychology is too
much addicted to dreams, dream analysis; one has to go deep into
dreams.</p><p>Savita is a therapist, a psychoanalyst, so obviously she must be
feeling offended when I put down or play down your dreamlife. Don’t feel
offended – this is a totally different approach. By analyzing dreams you
will never come to end them. By analyzing dreams you may become a little
more understanding about dreams, but awareness is not going to happen
through it. By analyzing dreams you may even start dreaming better
dreams, but better dreams are just dreams all the same. By analyzing
dreams you may start feeling your motivations hidden behind the dreams,
your repressed desires, your ambitions, but you will never come to know
who you are. How can one come to know who one is by analyzing dreams?
Dreams are objects and you are the subject. You have to take a
PARAVRITTI – a conversion; you have to move a hundred and eighty
degrees. You have to stop paying attention to the dreams; you have to
pay attention to the one who has been dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>The East is concerned with the witness, not with what it witnesses.
You may be seeing a real tree or you may be seeing a dream tree – it
makes no difference. For the Eastern approach it makes no difference
whether the tree is real or just a dream tree. In both the cases it is
the object, in both the cases you are not it. So what difference does it
make whether it is there really or you have just imagined it?</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that makes any difference is the one, the mirror, in
which the tree is reflected – true or untrue, that is irrelevant. But
the pool of pure water in you where it is reflected... pay attention,
emphasize the witness, go deeper into the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s my purpose here in order to help you – not to analyze your
dreams. That you can do in the West in a far more scientific way. The
West has become very very skillful in analyzing dreams. But the East was
never worried because the East says ALL IS DREAM, SO what is the point
of analyzing?</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no end. If you go on analyzing and the source that
creates the dreams is there, it will go on creating new dreams. They
will be coming and coming and coming.<span class=s4></span>That’s why
nobody is</p><p>ever totally psychoanalyzed; there exists not a single person on the
earth who is really and totally psychoanalyzed, because the goal of
total psychoanalysis is that dreams should disappear. That docs not
happen. It didn’t happen even to Freud or Jung. They continued to dream.
That means they continued to remain suppressed; that means they
continued to remain the same as they were before. Dreams were still
coming, because the source had not been radically changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The projector is working and you go on analyzing the film on the
screen, and you go on thinking how to analyze it. And then you differ,
your analysis differs; and then there are schools of psychoanalysis.
Freud says something, Jung says another thing, Adler still another, and
so on and so forth. Now there are as many psychoanalyses as there are
psychoanalysts, and everybody has his own opinion, and nobody can really
be refuted – because all is dream work,</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you say, if you can say it loudly, convincingly, with
authority, with argument, with logic, it appeals TO people – it must be
true. And they all seem to be true. ALL those interpretations seem to be
true, because no interpretation is of any worth. All interpretations are
wrong!</p><p><br></p><p>The East has a totally different kind of approach: witness – don’t
analyze. In analysis you become too much interested, focussed on the
dream. Forget the dream: just look at the watcher. That watcher is
constant. In the night IT sees dreams; in the day it sees dreams. First
you see the</p><p>dream, Savita, and then you are awakened abruptly and you see horror.
Then you fall asleep again and you may see a sweet dream, a beautiful
dream, a happy dream, or a nightmare again... and this goes on and on.
One thing is constant: the seer, the watcher, the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Turn upon the witness. And that’s what I am trying to say to you –
while you are dreaming in the day and when you are dreaming in the
night, only one good point about dreams is that you say:</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR PRESENCE IS IN MY DREAM-CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT FAIL, EVERY DREAM
SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good. At least one thing is constantly there which will help
you to fall upon yourself. Emphasize that presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples, “Make one thing constant in
your dreams and sooner or later you will get rid of dreams.” And small
things he used to give, small techniques, devices – and they work! To
one person he said, “Whenever you dream, just in the dream see that you
are raising your hands above your head. And in the daytime also,
practise this many times so you become very accustomed and habituated to
it, so it becomes almost mechanical, so even in dreams you can raise
your hand above your head.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said, “What will happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff said, “That, when you have become capable, come and tell
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Three months passed and the man continued, day in, day out, walking,
eating, whenever he would remember, he would raise his hand, and would
remember also, “Tonight am going to raise my hAnd in the dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then it happened after three months: one night he was dreaming
that he was walking on a road and there was much traffic and noise, and
suddenly he realized, and he raised his hand above his head – and the
dream was broken. And in THAT moment of dream gone, he suddenly saw
himself for the first time – the turning, the conversion. It was in the
middle of the night. He danced, he was so joyous. And since that day,
dreams disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>And when dreams disappear, reality comes closer and closer every day.
It is the dreams that are hindering you from seeing that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>When he came in the morning to see Gurdjieff, before he had told
anything Gurdjieff said, “So it has happened – because I see your eyes
have a different, shine, a different light. They have clarity. That
dream stuff that used to move behind your eyes is no more there. So it
has happened! So you were capable of raising the hand! Now don’t be
worried: whenever it comes, again raise the hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Every possibility is that it may not come again, because at least you
have done one thing consciously. Even in y our dream, just a small thing
of raising your hand, you remembered a small thing. It was very small,
but remembrance is great. You remembered, even in your dream. So the
witness has reached there – now no need to worry.”</p><p>I would like to say to Savita: Invite me more and more in your
dreams. Let me also enjoy your dreams. Go every night with a very
conscious feeling that I will be there in your dreams. Make it an alert
effort, deliberate, and one day it is going to happen. It will not be
just a dreamlike phenomenon. I will be really as present as I am now, or
even more, because right now I can see there are dreams in Savita’s
eyes. If in your dream you can see me as I am even for a single moment,
all dreaming will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis is to no point. Dreams have to go. When dreams are gone,
reality comes in. By one door, dreams go out; from another door the
reality enters in. And reality is silent, quiet, peaceful,
blissful.…</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DYING WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE? IS FALLING
IN LOVE A SUICIDAL DESIRE? OR JUST A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCT LIKE THE
LEMMINGS’ MARCH TO THE SEA OR A MOTH’S FLIGHT INTO A FLAME? IT’S
WEIRD.</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE is DEATH, but the one who dies in love has never existed really.
It is the unreal self, the idea of an ego, that dies.</p><p><br></p><p>So love is death, it is suicide, it is dangerous. That’s why millions
of people have decided against love. They live a loveless life. They
have decided in favour of the ego – but ego is false. And you can go on
clinging to the false and the false will never become real. So the life
of an egoist always remains in insecurity. How can you make something
unreal real? It is always disappearing. You have to cling to it, you
have to constantly create it again and again. It is a self-deception.
And it creates misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Misery is the function of the unreal. The real is blissful –
SATCHITANAND. The truth is blissful, and the truth is awareness. SAT
means truth, CHIT means consciousness, ANAND means bliss. These three
things are the qualities of truth. It is so, it is alert, and it is
blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>Unreality is misery. Hell is that which does not exist but you
create, and heaven is that which exists but you don’t accept. Paradise
is where you really are, but you are not courageous enough to move into
it. And hell is your private creation. But because it is your creation,
you cling to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has never left God. He lives in God, but still suffers because he
creates a small hell around himself. Heaven need not be created – it is
already there; you have to relax and enjoy it. Hell has to be
created.</p><p><br></p><p>Take life in a relaxed mood. There is no need to create anything, and
there is no need to protect anything, and there is no need to cling to
anything. That which is will whether you cling to it or not, and that
which is not cannot remain whether you cling to it or not. That which is
not is not, and that which is is.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DYING WHEN YOU ARE IN
LOVE?</p><p>Because the ego, the unreal, dies. Love opens the door to the real.
Love is the threshold of the temple. Love opens you towards God. It
brings great joy, but simultaneously it brings great fear: your ego is
disappearing. And you have invested so much in the ego. You have LIVED
for it, you have been taught and conditioned for it. Your parents, your
priests, your politicians, your education, your school, college,
university, they have all been creating your ego. They have been
creating ambition; they are factories to create ambition. And one day
you find yourself crippled by your own ambitions, caged by your own ego.
You suffer much, but the whole life you have been taught that this is
valuable, so you cling to it – you suffer and you cling to it. And the
more you cling, the more you suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>There are moments when God comes and knocks at your door. That’s what
love is – God knocking at your door. Maybe through a woman, through a
man, through a child, through a love, through a flower, through sunset,
sunrise... God can knock in millions of ways. But wherever God knocks,
you become afraid. The priest, the politician, the parent, and the
created ego – it is at stake. It starts feeling that it is dying. You
pull back. You hold back. You close your eyes, you close your ears; you
don’t hear the knock. You disappear back into your hole. You close your
doors.</p><p><br></p><p>Love feels like death – it is. And those who want to be really
blissful have to go through that death, because the resurrection is
possible only through death.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is right when he says you will have to carry your cross on your
shoulders. You will have to die. He says, “Unless you are reborn, you
will not see my Kingdom, you will not see what I am teaching to you.”
And he says, “Love is God.” He is right because love is the
threshold.</p><p><br></p><p>Die in love. It is far more beautiful than to live in ego. It is far
more true than to live in the ego. Life in the ego is death in love.
Death in the ego is life in love. Remember: when you choose ego, you are
choosing real death – because it is death in love. And when you choose
love you are only choosing unreal death, because to die in ego you are
not losing anything – you had nothing from the very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the whole emphasis of Ikkyu’s DOKA yesterday. You are not, so
why be afraid? Who is going to die? There is nobody to die! To whom are
you clinging? Whom do you want to make safe? Whom do you want to protect
and armour? There is nobody. There is only emptiness... emptiness...
utter emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to Ikkyu’s song. Accept this emptiness and the fear will
disappear. Be a moth when you find the flame of love burning bright – be
a moth! Jump into it... and you will lose the false and you will gain
the real; and you will lose dreams and you will gain the ultimate. You
will lose something which was not there and you will gain something
which has always been there.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>WHY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN MAN AND WESTERN WOMAN NOT
SUCCESSFUL? IT ALWAYS BREAKS AT SOME POINT. WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM
WHICH COMES IN, WHICH STOPS THE RELATIONSHIP FROM GROWING MATURE? PLEASE
SAY SOMETHING.</p><p>VEDANT BHARTI, all relationships break at some point – have to break.
You cannot make your house on the threshold, you should not. Love is a
door: pass through it. Pass, certainly, don’t avoid it. If you avoid it
you will miss the deity in the temple. But you should not make your
house on the threshold, at the door. Don’t remain there.</p><p><br></p><p>The door is just an opening. You have to move!</p><p><br></p><p>Love relationship is a must, but not the destiny, not the end – only
the beginning. I am all for love. But remember: love is something that
has to be transcended too.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two types of people – both go neurotic. One type is those
who are so much afraid of love because they are afraid of dying. They
cling to the ego. They avoid love. They may call it religion, but it
can’t be religion – it is just sheer ego and nothing else. That’s why
the monks – the Catholic, the Hindu, the Buddhist – they have such
stronger egos, subtle but very strong, hidden but very strong. The
humbleness is only superficial, is just a sugar coating on the poisonous
ego. They have pious egos, but egos are there. And a pious ego is more
dangerous than an ordinary ego – because the ordinary ego is apparent,
you can’t hide it. But the pious ego is very hidden and you can carry it
in subtle ways for ever and ever.</p><p><br></p><p>So this creates one kind of neurosis: people avoid love and they
think they are going towards God. You can’t go because you have avoided
the door itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is another kind of neurosis: seeing the beauty of love,
taking the courage to jump into it, dissolving the ego for a few
moments... because in love it can only be for a few moments. The ecstasy
of love cannot be eternal, because it is ecstasy between two parts
meeting, dissolving into each other. Unless you dissolve with the whole
you can’t have eternal ecstasy. Dissolving with the part – with a man,
with a woman – you will be dissolving only in a very small drop of God.
It can’t be oceanic. Yes, for a moment you will have the taste, and then
the taste disappears. This creates another kind of neurosis: people
cling to love affairs. If love dies with one woman, they change to
another woman, another man; they go on and on. They start living on the
threshold. They have forgotten the deity, they have forgotten about the
temple. Love has to be transcended into prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Never be in the neurosis of the first kind, and never cling to the
second kind of neurosis. Go on... move on.</p><p><br></p><p>A great emperor, Akbar, created a small, beautiful capital in India.
It was never used because before it was completed Akbar died. So his
capital was never transferred to it from Delhi. The place’s name is
Fatehpur Sikri. It is one of the most beautiful towns ever planned – and
never used by any man.</p><p><br></p><p>Every small detail was looked into. Great architects of those days
were consulted, great masters were consulted. Akbar asked all the great
teachers in India of those days to give him a small sentence which could
be written on the door, the passage. A bridge led to Fatehpur Sikri – a
river had to be crossed and Akbar had made a beautiful gate on the
bridge. Some Sufi suggested a saying of Jesus, and he loved it. Many
sayings were suggested, but He loved it and that saying was written on
the door. That saying is beautiful. It doesn’t exist in the Bible; it
has come from another oral source. It says: Life is a bridge – pass
through it, but don’t make your house on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is also a bridge – pass through it.</p><p>So no love affair EVER succeeds. Gives you hope, gives you great
hope, but always ends in frustration. That frustration is in-built; just
as the ecstasy is in-built, so is the frustration. In the beginning it
is ecstasy, in the end it is frustration. That frustration will lead you
to go beyond, otherwise how will you go beyond? When will you search for
the real deity in the temple if you cling to the door? If you think,
“The door is enough and I am contented,” then nobody will ever move.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says man reaches to God through love, love is God – but this is
only half of the truth. The other half is: man never reaches through
love – man reaches only by transcending love. When both are understood
together, you have understood the phenomenon of love. Love is God and
love is not God. In the beginning it is, in the end it is not. In the
beginning it brings ecstasy, those honeymoon days, and then the
frustration, the boredom that every marriage ends in.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of two persons sitting together, bored. All has been
explored and there is nothing to explore any more. This is the moment!
Either you can start looking for another man, another woman, or you can
start looking beyond love.</p><p><br></p><p>You have lived love, you have seen its beauties and you have seen its
uglinesses; you have seen its joy, you have seen its misery; you have
seen its heaven and its hell. It is not pure heaven, no; otherwise
nobody will ever go to God. t is pure heaven and pure hell – it is both.
Hell and heaven are two aspects of it. In the beginning hope and in the
end frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>Passing through that hope and that frustration again and again, one
day the understanding arises, “What am I doing on the threshold? I have
to go beyond!” And not out of anger but out of understanding one goes
beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing: no relationship ever succeeds. And it is
fortunate that no relationship ever succeeds – otherwise, when will you
relate to God? Why should you think of God? Man thinks of God because
love gives a glimpse. Man thinks of God because love gives hope. And man
HAS to think about God because love gives frustration. All hopes turn
into hopelessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Without love there will be no search for God because man will not
have any experience of hope and meaning and significance and grandeur.
Love gives you a glimpse of the beyond... don’t cling to it. Take the
hint of it, and search for something more, go on searching. Use love as
a stepping-stone.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: WHY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN MAN AND WESTERN WOMAN
NOT SUCCESSFUL?</p><p><br></p><p>So first thing: no relationship is successful, whether between Indian
man and Western woman, or Western man and Western woman, or Indian man
and Indian woman. It can’t succeed; its very nature prohibits it. It
feels it is succeeding, but it never succeeds. It comes very very close
to success, but it never comes exactly to the point. It takes you on
great journeys, but it never supplies the goal. It keeps your hope
aflame, but just hope. But good, at least it takes you to the threshold.
One step has been taken; half the journey is complete, but half the
journey still remains.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing: it is more difficult between an Indian man and
a Western woman, or a Western man and an Indian woman. The problem is
not between man and woman, the problem is between Eastern and Western.
Man and woman are just man and Woman; East and West make no difference.
But the minds are there. Those minds create trouble.</p><p>The Indian has one kind of mind and the West has evolved a different
kind of mind. So when an Indian man is with a Western woman, or vice
versa, there is no communication. They don’t speak the same language. It
is not only that they don’t speak the same language – English, German or
French or Italian – they may speak the same language, still they don’t
speak the same language, because they have different kinds of minds.
Their expectations are different, their conditioning is different. The
Indian man says one thing and the Western woman understands another
thing. The woman says one thing and the Indian man understands something
else. Unless they drop the minds, unless they become pure man and woman,
there will be great difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>And Vedant Bharti must be asking this question out of his own
experience. One night, eavesdropping on Vedant Bharti, I heard this
dialogue:</p><p><br></p><p>Vedant Bharti: “Oh, my gorgeous, sweetest darling! Am I the first man
you’ve ever been to bed with?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the American girl: “Of course you are! Why do all you Indians
always ask the same stupid question?”</p><p><br></p><p>Different minds<span class=s4></span>The Indian mind is very male
chauvinistic. The Western woman is now a liberated</p><p>woman; she lives in a totally different kind of milieu. She is not
the woman you have lived with for centuries in India. It can’t be
possible now to possess a Western woman; she is no longer property – she
is as free as you are.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the woman has been taken as property; man can possess her.
Not only ordinary man – even great men in India think of woman as a
possession. You may have heard the famous story of Mahabharata.
Yudhishthira, one of the very famous men in Indian history – and has
been thought to be very religious, he is known as DHARMARAJ, a religious
king, or a king of religion – playing, gambling, he even staked his
wife. He gambled her, because it was thought that your wife is your
property. He staked his kingdom, he staked his treasury, he staked
everything; then only the wife was left – he staked the wife too. And
still in India he is thought to be one of the greatest religious men.
What kind of religious man is this? Just to think of staking an alive
person, gambling? But in India the woman has been thought of as
property; you are the possessor, and the whole and sole possessor.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West that slavery is no more, it has disappeared. It is good.
It has to disappear from India too. Nobody can possess anybody, man or
woman. NO person can be possessed; no person can be reduced to property!
This is ugly, this is sin! What can be a greater sin than this?</p><p><br></p><p>You can love a person, but you cannot possess. The love that
possesses is not love – it is ego.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the man is very male chauvinistic. And the Indian woman has
not yet asserted her freedom. There exists nothing like the lib movement
in India. The woman still goes on living in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>So when an Indian falls in love with a Western woman, the problem
arises – he starts possessing. And the Indian mind is very much obsessed
with sex; that too creates a problem. You will be surprised when I say
the Indian mind is very much obsessed with sex, because you think India
is very religious and moral. Yes, it is, but its morality and religion
are all so much based on repression that deep down is the obsession with
sex.</p><p>If your woman just holds somebody else’s hands, the husband is mad.
Just holding hands! Holding hands can be just a simple gesture of
friendship. There is no need to give any sexual colour to it, but the
Indian man cannot think that. If his woman is holding hands with
somebody else, that means she is sexually relating to somebody else. He
will be in a rage. He will not be able to sleep. He would like to kill
the man or the woman or himself. Something has gone very wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West things are looked at in a different way. One can hold
somebody’s hand just as a sheer gesture of friendship, of lovingness, of
sharing. It need not have any sexual overtone to it. Or, even if it has,
it is nobody else’s business. It is the person’s freedom. A person has
to decide his life, how to live, with whom to live. Nobody else can be
the decisive factor, but that creates problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Just listen to this: in the West sex is not so important as people in
the East think it is. Sex has almost become a sharing of energy, a
loving play with each other, a fun. It no longer has that seriousness
that it used to have in the past. In India it is still very very
serious. And when something is serious, remember, ego must be involved
in it. Ego is always serious; it makes everything serious. And whenever
something is playful, that simply shows ego is no more involved in it.
And ALL playfulness is good because it is liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>When you fall in love... if all Indian falls in love – and here it is
going to happen again and again – when an Indian falls in love, he is
falling very seriously. That is the trouble. And the woman may not think
it serious at all. She may think it is for the moment. You appeal to her
– for the moment. There is no commitment in it; there is no tomorrow to
it. But the Indian mind is bringing not only tomorrow – the whole life.
Or there are people who even think of other lives in the future. Those
are hidden sources; you don’t talk about them, but the clash is going to
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>She has fallen in love with you because she enjoys loving; it is a
beautiful experience. She has not fallen in love with you in particular
– she is in love with love itself. That is the difference. You are not
in love with love itself – you are falling in love with this particular
woman. It is a life-death problem for you. If tomorrow she starts moving
with somebody else, you will be mad. But you misunderstood. It was a
gesture of the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The American girl had just returned to New York from a holiday in
England and was talking to her best friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mabel, I’ve been thinking about Keith ever since I left England. Now
I’m back home and I don’t think I should write to him as our friendship
was only slight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But, Wendy, you promised to marry him!” “I know, but that was
all.”</p><p>Marriage no longer has that seriousness that it has in the East.
Marriage is just a kind of friendship – nothing special about it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t understand these different minds it is going to be a
difficult problem, communication will not be possible. Man in the East
has always enjoyed freedom – mm? – they say “Boys are boys.” But the
woman has not been given any freedom. In the West now there is no
discrimination. Man</p><p>or woman – both are free. And whatsoever man has been doing, now
woman is also doing, it; she has every right to do it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East we played a trick. The trick was that we placed woman
very high on a great pedestal; we worshipped woman. That was a trick to
imprison her. We satisfied her ego through worship. We said, “A woman is
a goddess, a woman is purity. A woman is not of this earth. A woman has
to be virgin before marriage and then she has to remain monogamous for
the whole of her life.” And we gave to much respect for this, and we
conditioned the women so much for this, that they became addicted to the
ego, and they remained on the pedestal. Imprisoned there, chains there!
And man was enjoying all kinds of freedom. Boys are boys.…</p><p><br></p><p>The woman in the West has come down from the pedestal. She says,
“Either you also come up on the pedestal or I am coming down. We both
have to exist on the same ground.” And that’s how it should be.</p><p><br></p><p>“I say, old man,” said Clive to the host of the party, ’there’s this
rather delectable young chick whom I’m getting along with really well,
if you know what I mean.”</p><p><br></p><p>He walked and continued, “And I wondered if I might use your spare
bedroom for a short while.” “No, I don’t mind,” replied the host. “But
what about your wife?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t bother about her,” said Clive. “I’ll only be gone a short
time and I’m sure she won’t miss me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I KNOW she won’t miss you,” stated the host. “It’s only five minutes
ago that SHE borrowed the spare bedroom!”</p><p><br></p><p>The male ego has never allowed that to happen. It has allowed itself
all kinds of freedom; it has not allowed that freedom to the woman. Now
things have changed in the West. Man and woman are standing on the same
plane as human beings. The woman is no more a goddess, and she does not
pretend and she does not WANT to pretend.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Indian mind is very much clouded by the past.</p><p><br></p><p>If you drop these minds, if you are just a man and a woman, then
there is no problem. The problems arise out of the Indian mind and the
Chinese mind and the American mind – if you drop the minds then there
are no problems. Then love can flow, and you can grow through it.</p><p><br></p><p>But still remember: no love can be ultimate satisfying. It can go a
LONG way but it cannot go the whole way. Finally you have to go beyond
it. Learn how to love by loving people, then one day use that learning
to fall in love with the whole, with existence itself. Only that day
have you come home.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question Question 5</p><p>NOTHING GOOD, NOTHING BAD. NOTHING TO GAIN, NOTHING TO LOSE. TAKE IT
EASY. WITH THIS AS A REFERENCE, PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN
EPICUREAN HEDONIST AND A ZEN BUDDHIST.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS NONE. The Zen Buddhist knows it, the Epicurean hedonist does
not know it. That’s the only difference – otherwise there is none.</p><p><br></p><p>Between the enlightened person and the unenlightened person there is
no difference at all, not even a single inch’s difference. The
enlightened person KNOWS it, the un-enlightened person does not know
about it – that’s all. The unenlightened person believes in the
distance, in the difference, hence he creates IT. The enlightened person
has come to know there is no difference. The belief has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OTHER MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD, EVOLUTION IN ALWAYS REACHING FOR STILL HIGHER LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS – FROM THE KINGDOM OF MINERALS TO THE KINGDOM OF VEGETABLES, ANIMAL, MAN, FROM PRESENT MAN TO ENLIGHTENED MAN.\nARE THESE TEACHINGS WRONG? OR IS THERE A BRIDGE TO PURPOSELESSNESS?\nSAT BODHI, SRI AUROBINDO IS A GREAT PHILOSOPHER but not a master at all. Very intelligent, very scholarly, a great intellectual, but not an enlightened master. He talks about God and talks beautifully, but it is all talk, it is all abstraction. It is not a realization.\nIf it is a realization, then there can’t be any goal. For example, if the world has evolution as the goal, then what will be the goal of evolution? Why evolution at all? Why in the first place? You will have to create another abstraction, and it will be a regress AD INFINITUM.\nWhatsoever you fix as the goal, the question will remain relevant about that. Why?\nIf this is the goal of evolution, to realize God, then what is the goal of realizing God? Just ask that question – and you are back to the same place. If enlightenment is the goal of life, then what is the\ngoal of enlightenment? And then you can see the point – enlightenment will have no purpose. And if the ultimate itself has no purpose, then what is the point of saying that life has purpose and the world has purpose? If the ultimate is purposelessness, then that ultimate permeates all.\nThis goal-orientation comes from the ego. The ego cannot accept that there is no goal. The ego cannot accept that there is no hierarchy. The ego cannot accept that min-erals and trees and animals and man and enlightened people ALL exist in a great simultaneity – there is no gradation. You would like to be higher, you would like to be somebody special – you are man, not a mineral. But what is so great in being a man? What is so great in being an animal? or a man or an enlightened man? Why create the hierarchy?\nAnd finally the whole thing falls flat – then in the end God has no purpose, and God is all.\nThose who have experienced, those who have not just been thinking about God, but those who have experienced will say God is nothing but the cosmic simultaneity of all. Minerals are exactly where man is – in their own way, in a different form. Trees are exactly where enlightened people are, in their own way, in their own form. Nobody is higher and nobody is lower. The ego cannot accept that because if there is nobody higher, nobody lower, the ego can’t exist at all. It can exist only through comparison. It has to put somebody lower and it has to put somebody higher. It can exist only in the middle of these two falsities. It has to put somebody lower so it can feel, “Good, so I am special.” And then it has to put somebody higher so it can go on striving, so that it can go on achieving, so that it can go on ladder-climbing.\nBut if the ultimate has no purpose... what purpose is there in enlightenment? Buddha is purposeless – just think of it – and you are purposeful; God is purposeless, and you are purposeful. If God is purposeless, you are purposeless – because you are not separate from God. Who is existing in the trees? Who is treeing in the trees? Who is hidden in the rocks? Who is singing in the birds? Who is speaking in me and who is listening in you? It is all one. The speaker and the spoken to are one, the knower and the known are one, the lover and the beloved are one.\nOnce this becomes comprehensible to you, you relax – you relax in the cosmic simultaneity. That’s what I mean when I say be natural. Ego brings unnatural desires in you; it drives you crazy. Life is simple, but to be simple one has to be purposeless. Any goal, and you can’t be simple. Any goal and you can’t be herenow. Any goal and the desire will rock you. Any goal, and you are on the way, again moving – you cannot enjoy this moment, the grace of this moment, the benediction of herenow.\nOnce you understand this, all goals disappear and with all those goals, you disappear – then what is left is enlightenment. To know that there is no purpose is to become enlightened, to know that all is good as it is. And we are all participating into the same reality. Nobody is higher and nobody is lower. There is no comparison needed.\nWhich is higher? – ice is higher or water? Vapour is higher or ice? We know that there is nothing higher or lower – ice, water, vapour, are all manifestations of one reality called H20. H20 has these three forms. God has these millions of forms: man, woman, beautiful, ugly, stupid, intelligent, sinner, saint. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower. To see it is to be transformed. From that very moment you start disappearing, you start melting.\nPeople like Sri Aurobindo will give you a new kind of ego, a spiritual kind. You start striving for supra- mental states, supra-conscious states, and you are again in the same rut. The race has started again. First it was for money, power, prestige; now it is for supra-mental states. And ALL that comes as a shadow to it will be there. Then there will be competition, then somebody is going higher than you, then you are lagging behind, or you are going higher than somebody else. And everybody has to prove that he is higher, and he has to continuously fight those who are competing... then the whole nonsense has entered again. Then you are in a marketplace again – in a spiritual marketplace, of course, but what is the difference? In the ordinary marketplace somebody was richer than you, now somebody has more satori quality in him, now somebody is more meditative, now somebody is more enlightened.\nIf there is a goal, then even enlightenment will be in degrees – more or less. If there is no goal, you can become enlightened this very moment – YOU ARE! You just need the courage to recognize it, the courage to be it. It hurts be-cause the ego will have to be left – and ALL that you have tried in your life has been because of the ego. You may even be meditating because of the ego and for the ego. You want to have that attitude of ‘holier-than-thou’ so you can condemn the whole world and you can say, “I am a spiritual person – you all are materialists.”\nYou can go around India and you can see: every Indian thinks that, that the whole world is materialist except Indians – holier-than-thou. And then people have to invent ways so they can prove that they are holier-than-thou. They will eat this and they will not cat that; they will live according to a certain pattern, they will have a certain style. All these are mind games.\nBeware of people like Sri Aurobindo!\nMY approach is not that of evolution. Nothing is going anywhere – all is here. Things are changing, certainly, but there is no evolution. Things are moving, certainly, but nothing is going higher and nothing is left behind as lower. Drop those categories. And dropping them you will immediately be entering into a new world. Suddenly you will find friendship with trees, because they are no longer lower. Suddenly you will find a great affinity with birds, because they are no longer lower. Suddenly you will look into the eyes of your dog, and you will find a Buddha there too. Then the sheer joy of it is infinite. You will look into the eyes of your woman, and a Buddha is hiding there too.\nI make all things divine. I don’t want you to go to God – I bring God to you. And not only to you – I bring God to the whole existence. It is really there. There is no other reality; this is the only reality there is. This is the only dance there is. Don’t miss this dance! Don’t get obsessed with ideals, otherwise you will be losing an opportunity.\nSat Bodhi asks: YOU SAID LIFE AND EXISTENCE HAVE NO GOAL, THEY ARE A PURPOSE UNTO THEMSELVES.\nYes, it is so. It is not a philosophical statement. I am simply sharing my experience. I am not saying anything which I have not seen, felt, lived. I am simply opening my heart to you.\nIt is so.\nIt is not an argument. I am not trying to convince you of anything at all. I am simply making it clear to you what has happened to me. And I say to you: this is available to you too – and THIS\nvery moment. Not a single moment’s postponement is needed, because enlightenment is a state of nature.\nRelax, don’t be tense about goals, because all goals make tension, create tension, stress, strain, because you always have to look ahead, you have to look far away. You have to think of future things, you have to plan for them. And you have to strive. Naturally, tension arises, anxiety arises, anguish arises. You are torn apart – your reality is here and your heart is somewhere else. You become schizophrenic.\nWhen I say relax, I mean drop all goals – drop ALL ideals. Relax into this moment... listen to this moment, live this moment, have a taste of it. Be surrounded by the reality that is already here, and suddenly you will also have the same taste I am talking about. It is an experience, existential. It is not speculation.\nYou say: OTHER MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD...\nI DON’T TEACH YOU ANYTHING AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD. I teach you only life, love, joy. I don’t want you to become obsessed with the future. NOW is my teaching – if it can be called a teaching. Rather than calling it a teaching I would like to call it a sharing. I am not a teacher in that sense. I am not giving you a doctrine so that you can adapt yourself to the doctrine and you can become a follower. I want you to become me, not a follower.\nBut you are so miserly. Not only in giving: even in taking you are so miserly. To hide that miserliness you philosophize in so many ways – these are strategies. You are afraid to relax. So first you were tense for money, for a better house, for a better job, for a more beautiful woman. Now you are tense for evolution – how to become enlightened, how to become a Buddha?\nYou need a good kick in the pants. That’s exactly what happened...\nA great seeker, a philosopher, a thinker, came to Ma Tzu. Ma Tzu is one of the rare Zen masters. And the philosopher asked – he was a professor in a university – he asked how to become enlightened, how to become a Buddha. Ma Tzu said – he was sitting in the temple just by the side of a great Buddha statue – he said, “To talk about such solemn and serious things, let us start by the right approach: you first bow down to Buddha.”\nIt looked so right that to talk about Buddhahood, to talk about enlightenment... and Ma Tzu said with great seri-ousness, “You bow down to Buddha.” So the philosopher bowed down – and Ma Tzu gave him a good kick, a terrific kick in the pants. And something happened... not only that you are laughing: the philosopher started laughing, seeing the whole ridiculousness of it. His first satori – he had some taste of Buddhahood in that moment.\nWhat really happened? He was not expecting such a kick from such a great man, such an enlightened sage. You never expect such things. It was such a shock. For a moment, his thinking stopped. For a moment, he could not think at all. This was so unexpected.\nIn that very moment, bowing down TO the statue of Buddha and Ma Tzu kicking him so unexpectedly – it was like an electric shock. It must have gone to the deepest core of his mind. For a moment,\nall thinking stops, all time stops... and he is looking at Buddha’s statue. In that very moment, that meditative moment, he started laughing.\nAnd years later on, he was again and again saying to people – people would ask him, “What happened to YOU? because you have never been the same man again” – and he would say, “Something strange happened. The day Ma Tzu kicked me, I have not stopped laughing since then. Whenever I bow down to Buddha again, I again remember Ma Tzu and the kick is again there. For a moment my thinking stops and I can see what this man means. He taught me without using a single word.”\nThat’s exactly what you need: a kick in the pants – a terrific kick. YOU ARE Buddhas! simply forgotten. You need only a remembrance – no evolution! It is NOT that you have to become a Buddha. You ARE a Buddha, fallen asleep. Somebody needs to kick you. Somebody needs to SHOUT at you. Somebody needs to hit you. And that is the purpose of a master. Ma Tzu is a master.\nSri Aurobindo is not a master; Sri Aurobindo is just philosophizing, giving a consolation to people. Many people came to him, thousands became interested in him – because it is so cheap to become interested in philosophy. Nothing is lost, nothing is at stake, and you learn beautiful words, and you start dreaming about things, and somebody systematizes the whole thing. He was a great systematizer: he labels things, categorizes them; he goes with such a system that he has a great appeal for the logical mind, for the modern mind. But just because he has the appeal, that simply shows that he suits the modern mind, and anything that suits the modern mind is not going to change it.\nYou need somebody who can possess you unexpectedly, who can shatter your ideas – who can shatter you, who can take the very earth from beneath your feet. Only very courageous people become interested in a master. To be with a master is dangerous. One never knows what he is going to do, one never knows what he is going to say. He himself does not know! Things are happening. He is in tune with the whole, so whatsoever happens happens.\nRemember, Ma Tzu has not kicked this man – if Ma Tzu had kicked this man there would have been nothing, maybe a fight. God has kicked through Ma Tzu. Ma Tzu functioned only as a hollow bamboo.\nThe ways of a sage are strange, illogical, paradoxical. Sri Aurobindo can’t be a sage – he is so systematic, so logical. His very logicalness is enough of a proof that he knows nothing. He is clever with words, a genius with words. I don’t think anybody else in this century was so capable with words, with such talents of logic, scholarship, reading, research. But behind all that jargon there is nothing.\nAnother man was alive in Sri Aurobindo’s days, Ramana Maharshi. He had the experience. Very few people went to him, very few, but those who went were benefitted. But to see Ramana Maharshi needs a totally different kind of approach. He will not speak much; he will not try to convince you. He will be sitting there – if you are available, he is available. And his ways will be very simple. Unless you have a heart to feel that vibe, you will miss him.\nIt is not always so. J. Krishnamurti is there. He talks; talks very intelligently. Remember, I will not say logically: talks very intelligently; goes into the analysis of any problem as deeply as is humanly possible. But he is not a philosopher either. All his talk is just like uprooting weeds from the garden. He destroys your problems through his analysis. He does not give you anything; he simply takes away all that you have been carrying in your mind. For a moment you are utterly lost – and in that very moment you can see his reality. His experience starts flowing in you. People can miss him also.\nPeople used to miss Sri Ramana because he was silent; he would not say much. Just the other day I mentioned U.G. Krishnamurti. When he saw Ramana Maharshi reading joke books nad looking at cartoons, he was very much frustrated. Not only that: a man asked a question about God and U.G. Krishnamurti was present there – very seriously, bowing at his feet, a man asked about God. And what did Sri Ramana do? do you know? He gave him a joke book and said, “Read it!”\nNaturally, U. G. Krishnamurti was very much offended. Is this a way? This seems to be disrespectful to the man who has asked such a serious question – to give him a joke book. This is again a kick in the pants, in its own way.\nWhat he is saying is, “What nonsense are you talking about! God? It is not a thing to be talked about – better read a joke book and have a good laugh.\n“If you can laugh, maybe you can know God – not by what I will say. But if you can laugh a hearty laugh, a belly-laugh, in that moment thinking stops.”\nNow, he has given a great message without saying a single word. Have you not watched it? When you laugh you are off mind. For a moment you are no more in the mind. Laughter takes you somewhere else. Where does it take you? It takes you to the same place where meditation takes you. So if you see a very serious and sad man and he claims that he is meditating, know well that he is not meditating. Meditation is always dancing. It is never serious, sad – it is sincere, of course, but never sad. It is joyous, it is gay.\nYou must have heard the old proverb: “Laugh and the whole world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone.” They have changed this proverb a little bit in the modern times. Now they say: “Laugh and the whole world laughs with you; weep and you sleep alone.” But it is the same.\nIn the moment of laughter, suddenly you are one with the harmony of existence. Weep... you have fallen apart, you are no more part of it. In sadness, in seriousness, in despair, you are not in rhythm with existence. In laughing, in dancing, in singing, in loving, you are in rhythm with existence.\nThere is no evolution – only rhythm or no rhythm. These are two states, and they are available right now. You can be in rhythm, you can be not in rhythm – that is the freedom of man. Trees are continuously in rhythm, birds are continuously in rhythm. Man can choose. These are different manifestations. Because you can choose, you have chosen the wrong. And the wrong has an appeal – because by choosing the wrong, you become important; by choosing the right, you disappear. And you have been taught from the very childhood to be important, to be the first in the world. You have been taught ambition, you have been poisoned to the very core. So always you want to be important.\nNow, this U. G. Krishnamurti missed Sri Ramana – and something great was happening. Almost like Buddha giving his flower to Mahakashyap, Sri Ramana giving a joke book to a man who is asking\nabout God, or Ma Tzu giving a terrific kick in the pants. U. G. Krishnamurti missed Ramana. Then he missed J. Krishnamurti too. He lived for years with J. Krishnamurti.\nNow, J. Krishnamurti is totally different in his expression, very logical, very rational. The beginning of his work is always with the mind; then slowly slowly he leads you beyond the mind, But there U.\nG. Krishnamurti thought it was all abstraction, philosophy. He stopped going there because “It is all abstraction.” He left Sri Ramana because there was no philosophy. He left Krishnamurti because there was too much philosophy. In both the cases he missed.\nAnd he lived with Sri Sivananda of Rishikesh for seven years doing yoga postures. There for seven years he thought, “Something is here.” And there was nothing! Sivananda is a very ordinary teacher. You can find dozens of them all around this country teaching people how to stand on their heads, teaching people stupid things. There he remained for seven years, became a disciple.\nNow, he missed two pinnacles... and this is what goes on happening. You have a mind, a certain mind. When you go to a master, you look from your mind. If it fits, you are happy; you start clinging. But that is not going to help – because it fits, it will strengthen the same mind that you had brought with you. If by chance you come across a real master, nothing is going to fit. He is going to disrupt all your ideas about how a master should be; he is going to sabotage you. He is going to take all expectations. He is to frustrate you, he is to disappoint you in every possible way – because that is the only way real work can start. And if you still can be with him, then... then you are going to be awakened.\nSleep is easy, cheap; awakening is arduous. You will have to renounce your dreams and you will have to re-nounce much comfort, much convenience. You will have to renounce many ideas that you have always thought very valuable.\nMy approach is that there is no evolution happening. The world is exactly where it always has been, and will remain there. And I don’t mean that things are not changing – bullock-carts have disappeared and cars have come, and cars are on the way to disappearing sooner or later; some private flying machines will soon be around.\nMany things have changed, but really nothing has changed. At the core, everything is exactly the same. Do you think that if you become enlightened today you will be more enlightened than Buddha because twenty-five centuries have passed and man has evolved? Do you think the people who were there in Buddha’s days were more unenlightened than you are? Or go still further back... Moses... or still further back... Krishna. Do you think in the days of Krishna, five thousand years ago, there were less enlightened people, more unenlightened people than there are today? It is exactly the same.\nTime makes no difference! When you become enlightened, on what date, will not be a decisive factor. When you become enlightened, you become enlightened! You simply become aware. You are no more asleep. You remember, you recognize your reality, and you are in tune. Cars may be passing by, or bullock-carts – do you think it makes any difference? Would Buddha have been more enlightened if cars’ had been passing by in Bodhgaya and trains had been shrieking and aeroplanes had been rushing from one airport to another? What happened to Buddha in Bodhgaya twenty-five centuries ago would have been the same – bullock-carts or cars or aeroplanes or spaceships make\nno difference. And the people who were unenlightened were as unenlightened as the people are today.\nAt THAT depth nothing ever changes, there is no evolution. Otherwise, Buddha will have to Come back to become more enlightened this time... and then there is no end. Then every time you become enlightened, after a few centuries you have to come back and become more enlightened be-cause now more sophisticated enlightenment is available.\nAt the deepest core nothing is changing. Only on the periphery do things change.\nOTHER TEACHERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD...\nThese people appeal because you want some longing, ambition, desire, you want some passion, and these people supply you with it. Whatsoever is demanded is supplied. Because you want something to cling to, they give you spiritual commodities. You can’t remain without desires, so you say, “Now I am no more interested in the world” – and they give you other-worldly desires.\nThey say, “Okay, take this. Now worry about this. You have worried enough about the world – now worry about meditation, now worry about enlightenment. You have competed enough to reach to Delhi, now forget about Delhi – reach moksha, nirvana, paradise... but go on reaching!”\nAnd you feel very happy – a new toy has been given to you and you start playing with the new toy. Sooner or later you get fed up with that toy, then some other toy has to be given to you.\nJust the other day, somebody had written a letter to me. In Germany, somebody has invented a new kind... far superior to enlightenment – it is called ‘transformation’. Now you have played with the word ‘enlightenment’ too long – now somebody is bound to come and say, “That is nothing. Take transformation. Enlightenment is simply enlightenment – we transform! We take you to another, a new formation. Enlightenment means you remain the same and light comes to you. Transformation means you become totally new.”\nNow this appeals. A new toy. Then somebody will come and will give some other word. People go on playing with words. Beware!\nI really want to do work here. I don’t want to give you any more toys – I want to destroy all toys. It is going to be hard work. It is going to be painful. But if you can move with me just one step, I ask only one step: your dreams, your sleep, will have gone for ever... and then real life starts. Real life is with the whole. Unreal life is alone.\nARE THESE TEACHINGS WRONG? Sat Bodhi has asked.\nThey are not right or wrong – they are simply illusory. You cannot call them wrong even. They are not right, they are not wrong – they are simply illusory. They have nothing to do with truth. They have something to do with your mind. Your mind demands those things; somebody comes and supplies you. It is a con game.\nThe second question\nQuestion 2\nDOES ANYTHING OR ANYONE NEED CORRECTION? IT PUZZLES ME.\nPREM TUSHEER, NOBODY NEEDS CORRECTION. And who is going to correct? The moment it is said that somebody needs correction, sooner or later somebody is needed to dominate you, to manipulate you, to make a slave out of you.\nThat’s why leaders down the ages have been calling and shouting from the housetops that everything needs to be corrected, everything needs to be changed? improved. If nothing needs to be corrected, they won’t be leaders any more. They live on the idea that things need to be improved, revolutions have to be done – then they are great leaders.\nAnd nothing is ever improved, nothing can ever be improved. You can either be fast asleep or awake. And awakening is not a correction, remember. It is not correcting your sleep. If sleep is corrected that will mean a few more tranquillizers are injected in you so that you can sleep better. This is correction. New pillows, more comfortable; a new bed, more convenient; a better bedroom... these are corrections so you can remain asleep in a better way, so you can almost remain in a coma.\nSleep does not need correction. Awakening is not a correction in sleep – it is simply dropping sleep. It is moving into another kind of reality, having a totally different kind of relationship with existence.\nMoralists, politicians, puritans, priests, they are always after you, calling for correction. Everything needs to be corrected, every person needs to be corrected – that is their power. The world is dominated by politicians because of it. They always go on finding what has to be corrected, and they always go on deluding you that now the correction can be done. But there is only one way: if THEY are in power then the correction can be done.\nFirst they convince you that the correction is needed; then naturally when you become convinced, the correction is needed. And why do you become convinced? Because you are suffering – - suffering because of sleep, not because of immorality; suffering not because of sin, but because you are unconscious. And they come and they say, “This is why you are suffering. A better morality, a better code of conduct, better behaviour, a better character, and your suffering will disappear.”\nAnd you start correcting yourself, and you cannot correct – you need help, you need a priest, a guide to guide you. You need a leader! First they convince you correction is needed, and then naturally they come by the back door with all the paraphernalia to correct you. You become slaves. That has been the trick down the ages. People have been dominated; people have been reduced into things. People have been condemned, people have been praised – but all the same they have been dominated through condemnation, through praise.\nThis is the great conspiracy. I would like to tell you once and for all: there is no need for any correction. You are not to be improved upon. Then what is needed? Awakening is needed, not correction. Not better morality, not better ethical conduct – no. Just consciousness. And with consciousness, morality comes of its own accord.\nIn deep sleep, unconscious, how can you correct yourself? At the most, you can have a little better dreams. Maybe not in black and white – technicolour dreams, psychedelic dreams, but you can only have better dreams in sleep. You cannot have reality in sleep.\nI have heard:\nIt was a dark, cloudy night and the drunk staggered into the cemetery and fell into a hole which had been dug in preparation for a burial the following day. The drunk hiccupped and fell asleep.\nHalf an hour later another drunk swayed into the cemetery. He was singing loudly and his raucous voice woke up the drunk in the grave who suddenly started to yell that he was cold.\nThe singing drunk tottered to the edge of the grave and peered blurrily down at the complaining drunk. “It’s no wonder you are cold,” he shouted down to the drunk, “you have kicked all the soil off yourself!”\nThis is what has been going on. You are asleep, your leaders are asleep; you are asleep, your priests are asleep. The problem is not that the man has kicked all the soil off himselfAnd if this\nother drunk starts helping, what do you think he will do? He will throw the soil on him again.“No\nwonder he is feeling cold!” You need only one thing.\nAnd corrections are millions, and still they never suffice. You put one thing right on this corner, and something else goes wrong on another – because your sleep keeps a certain balance. Have you not watched? You stop smoking and then you start chewing gum. You stop one thing and you have to start another. And it is the same old game! YOU only go on changing things; you remain the same.\nCorrections are millions. There is no end to them; you can go on correcting and Correcting and you will never be correct. You will never be right. You can put ALL the wrongs right, and you will find yourself still wrong – because deep down you are still un.conscious, you don’t know who you are.\nThe first and the only step is to know who you are, is to become aware.\nTimothy was on holiday in Ireland and staying at a small country inn. One evening in the bar he was amazed by the following conversation: “That’s a beautiful hat you’ve got there,” said an old man to a young fellow who was standing next to him at the bar; “where did you buy it?”\n“At O’Grady’s,” replied the young man.\n“Why, I go there myself!” commented the old man. “You must be from around these parts then?” “Aye. From Murphy Street.”\n“Gracious!” exclaimed the old man. “I live there too!” “Quite amazing,” commented Timothy to the barman. “that those two folk over there live in the same street and have only just met.”\n“Don’t you believe it!” said the barman. “They’re actually father and son but they’re always too drunk to recognize each other.”\nNo correction is needed, just awareness is needed. Become more alert. No character is needed, because all character is false if you are not conscious, and all character is a bondage if you are\nnot conscious. And all character is nothing but chains – it doesn’t bring freedom. All morality is hypocrisy – if you are not aware, if you are not conscious.\nSo, to me, religion means only one thing: to be more conscious, to live more consciously. DOES ANYONE OR ANYTHING NEED CORRECTION? IT PUZZLES ME.\nIt has puzzled everybody down the ages. Forget about correction. Put your total energy into awakening. There are only two ways to be: unconscious or conscious. Choose.…\nThe third question Question 3\n“ENLIGHTENMENT IS MY TRUE NATURE; THERE IS NO NEED TO DO ANYTHING.”\n“ONLY WHEN EFFORT IS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AND ONE FEELS UTTERLY USELESS DOES GRACE COME.”\nWHAT IS ALL THIS? I AM CONFUSED. WHAT SHOULD I DO? SHOULD I CONTINUE WITH MEDITATION OR SHOULD I JUST SIT AND LET THINGS HAPPEN?\nPLEASE GUIDE ME.\nSHIV-PRIYANAND, IF YOU ARE CONFUSED then you will have tO continue meditations. Confusion is the illness: meditation is medicinal. Both the words – meditation and medicine – come from the same root. If you are confused, you will have to go on meditating. When you see the point without any confusion, then there is no need. But meditation will prepare you, meditation will force you to see the point that there is no need to do anything. Only meditation can do that.\nJust listening to me... I have told you that to be natural is to be enlightened. Now you think, “So, that is great! I can sit silently and do nothing.” But can you really sit silently and do nothing? If you can really sit silently and do nothing, then this question would not have arisen. You would have sat and known and you would have bowed before me and thanked me. There would have been no question. You would have come dancing to me, not with a question and a confused mind.\nIf you can sit silently doing nothing, what else is needed\nThat’s what Buddha was doing under the Bodhi Tree – sitting silently doing nothing... and then it happened.That’s how it happened to me! That’s how it always happens!\nBut not to do is not so easy. Because you have become so accustomed to doing something or other, even sitting will be a doing to you. You will have to force yourself in a yoga posture and you will sit strained, still, in control, holding, trying to sit silently and not do anything – and boiling within, to do a thousand and one things, and thousands of thoughts will clamour around, will distract you.\nCan you just sit and do nothing? That is the ultimate. That’s what nirvana is, samadhi is.\nIt can happen; just listening to me also it can happen, but great intelligence is needed then. Then, simply, you have seen the point – that to be natural is all. Then where is the confusion? From where can it come? Then what is the confusion? You have SEEN it, or you have not seen it. If you WILL sit silently, you will walk silently, you will eat silently, you will talk silently. You will become a non-doer, you will become a natural being.\nBut if you have not seen it, then you will need a few more crazy things; you will have to go through them. Those meditations will force you to see the point. Either you see just by listening and sitting by my side, or you will have to see the hard way.\nBuddha meditated for six years, and meditated intensely, totally. Then this realization arose in him: “What am I doing? Trees are perfectly happy, birds are perfectly happy – what am I doing? And these trees are not meditating, and these birds have never thought about meditation, and they have not read Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, and they don’t do yoga asanas and they don’t chant any mantras. And the whole existence is so tremendously ecstatic! What am I doing standing on my head and fasting and all that nonsense?”\nHe SAW it, but six years it took for him to see this. And he was no ordinary man. He was tremendously intelligent. It took six years for him to see the point. But the moment he saw it, he relaxed under the Bodhi Tree. He fell asleep and the next morning he was awakened. Not only physically he opened his eyes – spiritually his eyes were opened. Next morning when he opened his eyes, he was totally a different man – the real man had arisen. And just a glimpse of the real man, says Ikkyu, and you are in love. And the moment he saw his real man, he started living a life of compassion and love. There was no other way now, no choice. He became a natural man.\nSo, if you feel confused, then go on meditating. Meditation is not for enlightenment: meditation is for confused people. Meditation does not lead you to enlightenment; it simply makes you fed up with your confusion. Just see the point: meditation is not a way to enlightenment – it is just a way to get rid of confusion. And when there is no confusion, enlightenment comes of its own accord.\nMeditation’s work is negative. It takes things away from you. It does not give you anything; it simply goes on taking things away from you. Anger disappears, greed disappears, desire disappears, and you start losing whatsoever you had. You become every day poorer and poorer.\nThat’s what Jesus means when he says: Blessed are those who are poor in spirit.\nAnger is not there, greed is not there, ambition is not there. Slowly slowly, chunks of your being are cut from you. And one day suddenly nothing is there – or, ONLY NOTHING IS THERE. That very moment, light penetrates. All those things greed, anger, passion, lust, hatred, ambition, ego – they were hindering the path. They were not allowing the light to penetrate in you. They were functioning like a rock between you and God. All those removed... suddenly God enters into you and you enter into God.\nIf you understand me, there is no need for any meditation. But if you don’t understand me... to understand me meditation will be needed. Then go on doing it.\nI understand your confusion, your trouble. You can do it only if it leads to enlightenment. That’s what your problem is. You have not said it so clearly, but that’s exactly where the problem is. You can do\nit if I emphasize that it will lead you to enlightenment – that I cannot do, because that is not true. You want me to promise you so that you can go on doing meditation. You want me to hypnotize you, you want me to go on supporting your desires, your goals, that you want to become enlightened, that you want to become natural... now look at the whole absurdity of becoming natural! How can one become natural? NATURAL YOU ARE! All becoming will lead you towards unnatural structures. Becoming cannot bring you to being natural. Becoming means becoming unnatural.\nNatural you are, but you want me to support you because you cannot sit silently. You cannot sit, really; you need something to think about, something to do. You want some goal. And if I take the goal away you ask, “Then why should I do meditation if it is not needed?” It is still needed. Needed, not for enlightenment – needed just to destroy this constant restlessness in your mind.\nIt is like this: if you live in a room with closed doors the sun will not penetrate, although opening the door is not creating the sun. By opening the door you don’t create the sun – the sun is there. But by opening the door, you become available to the sun. Meditations are just like opening the door.\nSo right now if you sit, you will be sitting in confusion, and the confusion will grow more and more if you sit. You will gather it; it will become almost impossible to bear it. And you will have to go to the movie or to the radio or the TV or to the club – you will have to go somewhere.\nMeditations are cathartic. They throw all the rubbish that you contain inside. They simply cleanse you. They open the doors, they open the eyes – the sun is there. Once you are available, it starts penetrating you.\nThen you will never say, “I became natural.” You will say, “I was natural. The problem was not how to become natural – the problem was how not to go on becoming unnatural.”\nThe fifth question Question 4\nYESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT THERE IS NO GOAL, NO PATH, NO ONE TO LEAD AND NO ONE TO FOLLOW. IS THIS STATEMENT A LIE AGAIN? WERE YOU KIDDING US YESTERDAY?\nThat’s what I am doing every day. That’s the only possible thing to do. ALL statements are lies. Truth remains unstated. Truth cannot be reduced to a statement, it cannot be reduced to a formula. It is vast! How can you reduce it to a statement? The moment you state anything about truth, the very expression becomes a barrier. Words cling around truth like chains.\nTruth can be transferred only in silence. So those who really listen me, they don’t listen to what I say – they listen to what I am. They listen to the gaps, they listen to the intervals. Words are not important, but there are small gaps between words and the meeting between you and me happens in those gaps.\nThose gaps are of meditation. Slowly slowly, words move on the periphery and my meeting, my communion with you becomes the center phenomenon. Words are there, just distant, on the periphery. Silence starts happening.\nIf you fall silent listening to me, then you have listened to me. If listening to me your mind stops and there are moments when there are no thoughts, all is still and quiet, then you have been listening to me.\nHearing me is one thing; listening to me is quite another. Those who come near to me for the first time, they hear. And those who stay with me for a longer time, slowly slowly the transformation happens. Hearing starts changing into listening.\nListening is non-verbal. Then my presence is listened to – then something is bridged between me and you. Then my heart and yom heart start beating together in one rhythm. Then it is a song, a dance of energies.\nThis is what in the East is called SATSANG – to be in the presence of the master. It is not a verbal communication at all. Then why do I go on speaking? Why can’t I sit silently here? That much silence you will not be able to absorb. You can absorb it only in homeopathic doses, only once in a while.\nAnd my words help. They don’t state the truth, but they help, they indicate; they are fingers pointing to the moon. They are not the moon themselves, just fingers pointing to the moon, arrows. Don’t be obsessed by the fingers, don’t start clinging to the fingers, don’t start worshipping the fingers – because that is how you will miss the moon. Forget the fingers and look at the moon.\nThat moon is silence, utter silence, where not even a single word has ever been uttered.\nYou have that space inside you. I have become one with it; you are not one with it. But once in a while, moving with me, flowing with me, hearing my words, listening to my silences, once in a while it happens. And those moments are of grace. In those moments you have the first taste of God. Slowly slowly, you will become more and more capable. That’s why I go on speaking.\nAnd then new people are always coming. For them I have to speak. For the older ones, slowly slowly they will not be bothered by my words. Hearing will disappear completely. They will listen to my words just as they listen to the sound of a waterfall They will not search for any meaning in them. They will not search for any truth in them. They will not search even for any coherence in them. They will not be constantly looking into consistency, contradiction, logic, illogic – no, all these things by and by disappear. They will listen to my words as they listen to the songs of the birds, or the wind passing through the pine trees. You don’t ask what the meaning is. You simply listen... and in that listening you become that sound passing through the pine trees, you become that wind.\nWhatsoever I say is a device so it is a lie. Truth has never been said, cannot be said. Truth is unutterable. But you can listen to it. It is unutterable, it can’t be said, but it can be listened to.\nLet me repeat: it cannot be uttered, but it can be listened to. You can catch hold of it – in silence, in love, in communion. I am not able to say it, but you are able to listen to it. Hence this device of talking to you every morning, year in, year out. This is just a waterfall... listen to it, don’t remain just hearing.\nAnd I am so contradictory by arrangement. I manage it, because if I am very consistent, you will never be able to listen to me, you will go on hearing me. I am so contradictory – sooner or later you\nare tired. You say, “What is the point? because this man is going to say one thing this morning and tomorrow he is going to contradict it.” Seeing it happening again and again.You will cling to my\nstatement and then tomorrow I contradict it, I have to contradict it. Whenever I see that somebody is clinging somewhere to any of my statements, I have to contradict it immediately – to relieve him of the burden, to relieve him of his clinging, to relieve him of the words that he has accumulated inside himself.\nSo I will go on, zigzag, contradicting myself a thousand and one times. Slowly slowly, the understanding dawns on you that there is no point in clinging to any words of this man, there is no need to bother about what he says. But by that time you have fallen in love with me. By that time you are in a totally different kind of relationship with me than you have ever been with anybody else. By that time, you have started enjoying my presence. By that time you have started imbibing me. By that time you have started feeling the nourishment. Now you don’t care what I say: now you care more that I am. Then listening has started.\nAnd you will understand me only by listening. You will understand me only when you have forgotten all about understanding what I am saying. All statements are lies. Lao Tzu is true. He says: Tao cannot be said, and the moment you say it you have betrayed it. He is absolutely true.\nTruth is so infinite and words are so finite. Only when you have something infinite in you.silence is\ninfinite, unbounded – it can contain truth. Love is infinite, unbounded – it can contain truth. Trust is infinite, unbounded – it can contain truth.\nBe natural, spontaneous here with me. Be in the moment, as if all time and space has disappeared, as if the whole world has stopped. The mind has stopped.and suddenly there is truth in all its\nradiance, grandeur, splendour.\nIt is here, right this moment. If you have ears, hear it. If you have eyes, see it. And if you cannot see it, and if you cannot hear it, then don’t go on clinging unnecessarily here. I am in a hurry – I don’t want any weeds here. I will find every possible means and ways to drop people who are just sitting there like rocks. Either throb with me, or get lost. Either be with me, or don’t be here. Because I MEAN to do business!\nThe last question Question 5\nI SEE I DON’T TRUST LIFE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. NOTHING FEELS POSSIBLE UNLESS I DO. THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN TRUST HAPPENS, BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO AT OTHER TIMES WHEN I DON’T FEEL IT? PRETENDING TRUST SEEMS EVEN WORSE. LIVING IN FEAR FEELS NO GOOD EITHER.\nRupa, that’s how we go on creating new goals. I go on taking goals from you and you go on creating new goals. Now one hundred percent trust – now that becomes the goal. Ninety-nine percent and you are worried.\nCan’t you simply be as you are? Why bother about one hundred percent trust? Trying to be one hundred percent when you are not is bound to create hypocrisy. You will become artificial, you will become unnatural.\nAnd do you know what one hundred percent trust means? One hundred percent trust means trusting even in your mistrust – that’s what one hundred percent trust means. If there is a moment of untrust, you trust that moment too! What can you do? One moment you trust me, good; another moment you don’t trust me, good. This is one hundred percent trust. When ALL is good it is one hundred percent trust.\nNow you are again trying to create trouble and anxiety for yourself. One moment you trust me – good, you feel very good. Then another moment comes distrust – now you are worried, now somehow you have to change this distrust into trust. Now you are again starting a new ladder.\nNow you will compare: “Somebody has one hundred percent trust – this moment never comes to him. And somebody has even less trust than me” – and you are becoming part of a hierarchy, you have started comparing. And you are creating ambition and fever. And when it does not happen, what are you going to do? And anything DONE by you will be unnatural. So you will become artificial: when it is not there you will pretend. You will at least believe that it is there – at least on the surface. You will become afraid of going deep into yourself, because if you go deep into yourself you will know that it is not there.\nOne hundred percent trust means: Accept life whatsoever it brings – trust, mistrust, love, hate, God, Devil, good, bad. You don’t try to change anything, don’t try to correct anything. Be in a let-go – that is one hundred percent trust.\nAnd let me remind you again, otherwise next day Rupa will be here saying, “I can allow let-go sometimes, but sometimes it doesn’t happen. The let-go is not one hundred percent.” LET-GO AGAIN MEANS THE SAME: when it happens, it happens; when it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. You are not supposed to do a thing.\nDo anything and you become artificial – and people have become so artificial. It is very rare, very rare, to see even a small part in a person which is not artificial. And it has all happened, this calamity has happened, because you are such a great improver – continuously improving upon yourself, correcting and correcting. From your very childhood your parents were correcting you, then your teachers were correcting you, then your professors were correcting you, your priests were correcting you – the whole society has just been correcting you. And, naturally, after twenty-five years of correction by everybody, you yourself become a great correcter. Then you start correcting yourself.\nIn fact, you are allowed to leave the university only\nhen you start doing the work of the parents and the teachers and the professors and the priest on your own – then they allow. Then they say, “Right, now there is no danger. This man will do whatsoever we were doing, and will do it far better because he will know from the inside, he will know the inside story.”\nHave you not observed it? Sometimes doing something, suddenly you hear your mother’s voice: “Don’t do it!” If you have not heard it, try to hear, and you will find your mother still saying, “Don’t do it!” ACTUALLY your mother’s voice you can hear, or your father’s, saying, “This is wrong. This is not the way to do the thing. Correct it!” Or your teachers correcting. They have created such a rift in you that you have become two.\nThis WHOLE society exists in a kind of schizophrenia. Every person is split. This society has tried the trick of divide and rule. It has divided every person into two: the correcter and the one who has to be corrected. So everybody has become like a small student and the headmaster – both are there! And the headmaster with the cane shouting and threatening, and the small child always being corrected. And of course the small child also takes revenge. Whenever the headmaster is not looking at the child, it does something – at least it can show his tongue or laugh or joke. Or there are moments when the small child will take possession of you and will force you to do something that you never wanted to do, and will make you repent. It always says, “Yes, sir,” but it never means it. It says, “Because I am afraid I am saying yes, but I will show you.”\nThis constant conflict goes on within you. And then everything becomes false, pseudo, phony. I have heard:\nGroom: “Would you be very annoyed with me if I confess that all my upper teeth are false?”\nBride: “Not at all, darling. At least I can now relax and take off my wig, inflatable bra, glass eye and artificial leg.”\nNow what is left? Just watch what you are carrying around yourself, what you think is your personality. What is it?\nAn American tourist, visiting England, had just enjoyed a delicious dinner in a Winchester restaurant. “Would you like coffee, sir?” inquired a waiter.\n“Certainly,” replied the American. “Cream or milk?”\n“Neither,” said the American firmly. “Just give me what I’m used to back home: a pasteurized blend of water, corn syrup solids, vegetable oil, sodium caseinate, carrageenan, guargum, disodium phosphate, polysorbate 60, sorbitan monostearate, potassium sorbate, and artificial colour.”\nNow what is left? Slowly slowly, everything becomes false, artificial, synthetic, plastic. Then you lose the taste of life. And when you lose the taste of life, you lose contact with God. When you become inauthentic, you become uprooted.\nPlease don’t try anything upon yourself Stop trying. Let things be. Let things be as they are. They are utterly beautiful. All ugliness is created by you. Yes, sometimes mistrust is perfectly beautiful. Sometimes doubt is good; it protects you from many foolishnesses. It protects you from gullibility. Sometimes trust is good, sometimes no trust is good. But whatsoever the case, THIS I call one hundred percent trust – that you always say, “Good, so this is the thing in this moment. So this moment God wants me to be trustful and this moment God wants me to be doubtful.” Leave it to God, and you simply be at the receptive end, a receptacle, and you will be surprised. Life will start happening to you and God will start happening to you.\nBut we are trained very deep down from the childhood to be false, to be untrue, to be formal.\nAn Englishwoman and her young son were travelling in a taxi in New York. As the taxi passed a particularly seedy part of the city, the small boy was fascinated by the garishly made-up ladies who were walking along the streets accosting some of the male passers-by.\n“What are those ladies doing?” asked the boy.\nHis mother blushed and said, somewhat embarrassed, “I expect they are lost and are asking people for directions.”\nThe taxi driver overheard this, and said in a loud voice, “Why don’tcha tell the boy the truth – in udda woids they’re prostitutes.”\nThe woman blushed even deeper red, and her son asked, “What are p... p... pros... what the driver said? Are they like other women? Do they have children?”\n“Of course,” replied the mother. “That’s where New York taxi drivers come from.”\nTruth is not accepted anywhere. People are annoyed with truth. False pretensions are very very acceptable. We have lived in lies so long that truth simply annoys. It is not just an accident that Socrates is poisoned – his only sin was that he was trying to make people aware of the truth. His sin was nothing else. He was a simple, innocent man, harmless, utterly harmless. He did not harm anybody in any way, but still Athens was angry. Why were they angry? He was trying to make people feel uneasy about their lies. He was trying to force them to see the truth.\nWhosoever tries to make you aware of the truth is going to be thought an enemy by the society. The society lives in lies, it depends on lies.\nI am not here to help in your lies. I can’t say to you to be one hundred percent in trust or at least the way you mean by one hundred percent. Then what will happen to those moments when you can’t trust? What will you do? You will simply cover them up. You will pretend that they are not there. You will throw them into the unconscious, in the basement of your being, and will never look there. And they will accumulate there and one day they will explode. No, that is not to be done. When distrust comes, allow it to come, and know that it is there. Accept it. It must have some meaning. If it is there, it must have some meaning.\nIt is like a thorn in the rosebush – not all are roses, a few thorns are there. They protect the roses. There must be some deep harmony between the thorn and the rose; so is there between trust and untrust. Accept the harmony of polarities. This I call one hundred percent trust – from my side. Trust everything that happens. Mistrust is included, doubt is included, nothing is excluded.\nI teach you totality in life. And sometimes when you are not total, that too is included in totality. Accept that too. And this will be a liberation. Then there will be no more creation of chains, no more creation of lies, no more repressions. And a man who is not repressed is bound to have the glimpse of the real man.\nOne glimpse of the real man, and Ikkyu is right, you are in love.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10081","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_1/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_1/>Take It Easy, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 The Cosmic Simultaneity of All</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10081 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Take_It_Easy_Vol_1/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THEMSELVES. OTHER MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION
AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD, EVOLUTION IN ALWAYS REACHING FOR STILL HIGHER
LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS – FROM THE KINGDOM OF MINERALS TO THE KINGDOM OF
VEGETABLES, ANIMAL, MAN, FROM PRESENT MAN TO ENLIGHTENED MAN.</p><p><br></p><p>ARE THESE TEACHINGS WRONG? OR IS THERE A BRIDGE TO
PURPOSELESSNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>SAT BODHI, SRI AUROBINDO IS A GREAT PHILOSOPHER but not a master at
all. Very intelligent, very scholarly, a great intellectual, but not an
enlightened master. He talks about God and talks beautifully, but it is
all talk, it is all abstraction. It is not a realization.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is a realization, then there can’t be any goal. For example, if
the world has evolution as the goal, then what will be the goal of
evolution? Why evolution at all? Why in the first place? You will have
to create another abstraction, and it will be a regress AD
INFINITUM.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you fix as the goal, the question will remain relevant
about that. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>If this is the goal of evolution, to realize God, then what is the
goal of realizing God? Just ask that question – and you are back to the
same place. If enlightenment is the goal of life, then what is the</p><p>goal of enlightenment? And then you can see the point – enlightenment
will have no purpose. And if the ultimate itself has no purpose, then
what is the point of saying that life has purpose and the world has
purpose? If the ultimate is purposelessness, then that ultimate
permeates all.</p><p><br></p><p>This goal-orientation comes from the ego. The ego cannot accept that
there is no goal. The ego cannot accept that there is no hierarchy. The
ego cannot accept that min-erals and trees and animals and man and
enlightened people ALL exist in a great simultaneity – there is no
gradation. You would like to be higher, you would like to be somebody
special – you are man, not a mineral. But what is so great in being a
man? What is so great in being an animal? or a man or an enlightened
man? Why create the hierarchy?</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the whole thing falls flat – then in the end God has no
purpose, and God is all.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have experienced, those who have not just been thinking
about God, but those who have experienced will say God is nothing but
the cosmic simultaneity of all. Minerals are exactly where man is – in
their own way, in a different form. Trees are exactly where enlightened
people are, in their own way, in their own form. Nobody is higher and
nobody is lower. The ego cannot accept that because if there is nobody
higher, nobody lower, the ego can’t exist at all. It can exist only
through comparison. It has to put somebody lower and it has to put
somebody higher. It can exist only in the middle of these two falsities.
It has to put somebody lower so it can feel, “Good, so I am special.”
And then it has to put somebody higher so it can go on striving, so that
it can go on achieving, so that it can go on ladder-climbing.</p><p><br></p><p>But if the ultimate has no purpose... what purpose is there in
enlightenment? Buddha is purposeless – just think of it – and you are
purposeful; God is purposeless, and you are purposeful. If God is
purposeless, you are purposeless – because you are not separate from
God. Who is existing in the trees? Who is treeing in the trees? Who is
hidden in the rocks? Who is singing in the birds? Who is speaking in me
and who is listening in you? It is all one. The speaker and the spoken
to are one, the knower and the known are one, the lover and the beloved
are one.</p><p><br></p><p>Once this becomes comprehensible to you, you relax – you relax in the
cosmic simultaneity. That’s what I mean when I say be natural. Ego
brings unnatural desires in you; it drives you crazy. Life is simple,
but to be simple one has to be purposeless. Any goal, and you can’t be
simple. Any goal and you can’t be herenow. Any goal and the desire will
rock you. Any goal, and you are on the way, again moving – you cannot
enjoy this moment, the grace of this moment, the benediction of
herenow.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand this, all goals disappear and with all those
goals, you disappear – then what is left is enlightenment. To know that
there is no purpose is to become enlightened, to know that all is good
as it is. And we are all participating into the same reality. Nobody is
higher and nobody is lower. There is no comparison needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Which is higher? – ice is higher or water? Vapour is higher or ice?
We know that there is nothing higher or lower – ice, water, vapour, are
all manifestations of one reality called H20. H20 has these three forms.
God has these millions of forms: man, woman, beautiful, ugly, stupid,
intelligent, sinner, saint. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower. To see it
is to be transformed. From that very moment you start disappearing, you
start melting.</p><p>People like Sri Aurobindo will give you a new kind of ego, a
spiritual kind. You start striving for supra- mental states,
supra-conscious states, and you are again in the same rut. The race has
started again. First it was for money, power, prestige; now it is for
supra-mental states. And ALL that comes as a shadow to it will be there.
Then there will be competition, then somebody is going higher than you,
then you are lagging behind, or you are going higher than somebody else.
And everybody has to prove that he is higher, and he has to continuously
fight those who are competing... then the whole nonsense has entered
again. Then you are in a marketplace again – in a spiritual marketplace,
of course, but what is the difference? In the ordinary marketplace
somebody was richer than you, now somebody has more satori quality in
him, now somebody is more meditative, now somebody is more
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is a goal, then even enlightenment will be in degrees – more
or less. If there is no goal, you can become enlightened this very
moment – YOU ARE! You just need the courage to recognize it, the courage
to be it. It hurts be-cause the ego will have to be left – and ALL that
you have tried in your life has been because of the ego. You may even be
meditating because of the ego and for the ego. You want to have that
attitude of ‘holier-than-thou’ so you can condemn the whole world and
you can say, “I am a spiritual person – you all are materialists.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can go around India and you can see: every Indian thinks that,
that the whole world is materialist except Indians – holier-than-thou.
And then people have to invent ways so they can prove that they are
holier-than-thou. They will eat this and they will not cat that; they
will live according to a certain pattern, they will have a certain
style. All these are mind games.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of people like Sri Aurobindo!</p><p><br></p><p>MY approach is not that of evolution. Nothing is going anywhere – all
is here. Things are changing, certainly, but there is no evolution.
Things are moving, certainly, but nothing is going higher and nothing is
left behind as lower. Drop those categories. And dropping them you will
immediately be entering into a new world. Suddenly you will find
friendship with trees, because they are no longer lower. Suddenly you
will find a great affinity with birds, because they are no longer lower.
Suddenly you will look into the eyes of your dog, and you will find a
Buddha there too. Then the sheer joy of it is infinite. You will look
into the eyes of your woman, and a Buddha is hiding there too.</p><p><br></p><p>I make all things divine. I don’t want you to go to God – I bring God
to you. And not only to you – I bring God to the whole existence. It is
really there. There is no other reality; this is the only reality there
is. This is the only dance there is. Don’t miss this dance! Don’t get
obsessed with ideals, otherwise you will be losing an opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>Sat Bodhi asks: YOU SAID LIFE AND EXISTENCE HAVE NO GOAL, THEY ARE A
PURPOSE UNTO THEMSELVES.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is so. It is not a philosophical statement. I am simply
sharing my experience. I am not saying anything which I have not seen,
felt, lived. I am simply opening my heart to you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not an argument. I am not trying to convince you of anything at
all. I am simply making it clear to you what has happened to me. And I
say to you: this is available to you too – and THIS</p><p>very moment. Not a single moment’s postponement is needed, because
enlightenment is a state of nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax, don’t be tense about goals, because all goals make tension,
create tension, stress, strain, because you always have to look ahead,
you have to look far away. You have to think of future things, you have
to plan for them. And you have to strive. Naturally, tension arises,
anxiety arises, anguish arises. You are torn apart – your reality is
here and your heart is somewhere else. You become schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say relax, I mean drop all goals – drop ALL ideals. Relax into
this moment... listen to this moment, live this moment, have a taste of
it. Be surrounded by the reality that is already here, and suddenly you
will also have the same taste I am talking about. It is an experience,
existential. It is not speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: OTHER MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION
AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD...</p><p><br></p><p>I DON’T TEACH YOU ANYTHING AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD. I teach you only
life, love, joy. I don’t want you to become obsessed with the future.
NOW is my teaching – if it can be called a teaching. Rather than calling
it a teaching I would like to call it a sharing. I am not a teacher in
that sense. I am not giving you a doctrine so that you can adapt
yourself to the doctrine and you can become a follower. I want you to
become me, not a follower.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are so miserly. Not only in giving: even in taking you are so
miserly. To hide that miserliness you philosophize in so many ways –
these are strategies. You are afraid to relax. So first you were tense
for money, for a better house, for a better job, for a more beautiful
woman. Now you are tense for evolution – how to become enlightened, how
to become a Buddha?</p><p><br></p><p>You need a good kick in the pants. That’s exactly what
happened...</p><p><br></p><p>A great seeker, a philosopher, a thinker, came to Ma Tzu. Ma Tzu is
one of the rare Zen masters. And the philosopher asked – he was a
professor in a university – he asked how to become enlightened, how to
become a Buddha. Ma Tzu said – he was sitting in the temple just by the
side of a great Buddha statue – he said, “To talk about such solemn and
serious things, let us start by the right approach: you first bow down
to Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>It looked so right that to talk about Buddhahood, to talk about
enlightenment... and Ma Tzu said with great seri-ousness, “You bow down
to Buddha.” So the philosopher bowed down – and Ma Tzu gave him a good
kick, a terrific kick in the pants. And something happened... not only
that you are laughing: the philosopher started laughing, seeing the
whole ridiculousness of it. His first satori – he had some taste of
Buddhahood in that moment.</p><p><br></p><p>What really happened? He was not expecting such a kick from such a
great man, such an enlightened sage. You never expect such things. It
was such a shock. For a moment, his thinking stopped. For a moment, he
could not think at all. This was so unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>In that very moment, bowing down TO the statue of Buddha and Ma Tzu
kicking him so unexpectedly – it was like an electric shock. It must
have gone to the deepest core of his mind. For a moment,</p><p>all thinking stops, all time stops... and he is looking at Buddha’s
statue. In that very moment, that meditative moment, he started
laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>And years later on, he was again and again saying to people – people
would ask him, “What happened to YOU? because you have never been the
same man again” – and he would say, “Something strange happened. The day
Ma Tzu kicked me, I have not stopped laughing since then. Whenever I bow
down to Buddha again, I again remember Ma Tzu and the kick is again
there. For a moment my thinking stops and I can see what this man means.
He taught me without using a single word.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly what you need: a kick in the pants – a terrific kick.
YOU ARE Buddhas! simply forgotten. You need only a remembrance – no
evolution! It is NOT that you have to become a Buddha. You ARE a Buddha,
fallen asleep. Somebody needs to kick you. Somebody needs to SHOUT at
you. Somebody needs to hit you. And that is the purpose of a master. Ma
Tzu is a master.</p><p><br></p><p>Sri Aurobindo is not a master; Sri Aurobindo is just philosophizing,
giving a consolation to people. Many people came to him, thousands
became interested in him – because it is so cheap to become interested
in philosophy. Nothing is lost, nothing is at stake, and you learn
beautiful words, and you start dreaming about things, and somebody
systematizes the whole thing. He was a great systematizer: he labels
things, categorizes them; he goes with such a system that he has a great
appeal for the logical mind, for the modern mind. But just because he
has the appeal, that simply shows that he suits the modern mind, and
anything that suits the modern mind is not going to change it.</p><p><br></p><p>You need somebody who can possess you unexpectedly, who can shatter
your ideas – who can shatter you, who can take the very earth from
beneath your feet. Only very courageous people become interested in a
master. To be with a master is dangerous. One never knows what he is
going to do, one never knows what he is going to say. He himself does
not know! Things are happening. He is in tune with the whole, so
whatsoever happens happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, Ma Tzu has not kicked this man – if Ma Tzu had kicked this
man there would have been nothing, maybe a fight. God has kicked through
Ma Tzu. Ma Tzu functioned only as a hollow bamboo.</p><p><br></p><p>The ways of a sage are strange, illogical, paradoxical. Sri Aurobindo
can’t be a sage – he is so systematic, so logical. His very logicalness
is enough of a proof that he knows nothing. He is clever with words, a
genius with words. I don’t think anybody else in this century was so
capable with words, with such talents of logic, scholarship, reading,
research. But behind all that jargon there is nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Another man was alive in Sri Aurobindo’s days, Ramana Maharshi. He
had the experience. Very few people went to him, very few, but those who
went were benefitted. But to see Ramana Maharshi needs a totally
different kind of approach. He will not speak much; he will not try to
convince you. He will be sitting there – if you are available, he is
available. And his ways will be very simple. Unless you have a heart to
feel that vibe, you will miss him.</p><p>It is not always so. J. Krishnamurti is there. He talks; talks very
intelligently. Remember, I will not say logically: talks very
intelligently; goes into the analysis of any problem as deeply as is
humanly possible. But he is not a philosopher either. All his talk is
just like uprooting weeds from the garden. He destroys your problems
through his analysis. He does not give you anything; he simply takes
away all that you have been carrying in your mind. For a moment you are
utterly lost – and in that very moment you can see his reality. His
experience starts flowing in you. People can miss him also.</p><p><br></p><p>People used to miss Sri Ramana because he was silent; he would not
say much. Just the other day I mentioned U.G. Krishnamurti. When he saw
Ramana Maharshi reading joke books nad looking at cartoons, he was very
much frustrated. Not only that: a man asked a question about God and
U.G. Krishnamurti was present there – very seriously, bowing at his
feet, a man asked about God. And what did Sri Ramana do? do you know? He
gave him a joke book and said, “Read it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, U. G. Krishnamurti was very much offended. Is this a way?
This seems to be disrespectful to the man who has asked such a serious
question – to give him a joke book. This is again a kick in the pants,
in its own way.</p><p><br></p><p>What he is saying is, “What nonsense are you talking about! God? It
is not a thing to be talked about – better read a joke book and have a
good laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you can laugh, maybe you can know God – not by what I will say.
But if you can laugh a hearty laugh, a belly-laugh, in that moment
thinking stops.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, he has given a great message without saying a single word. Have
you not watched it? When you laugh you are off mind. For a moment you
are no more in the mind. Laughter takes you somewhere else. Where does
it take you? It takes you to the same place where meditation takes you.
So if you see a very serious and sad man and he claims that he is
meditating, know well that he is not meditating. Meditation is always
dancing. It is never serious, sad – it is sincere, of course, but never
sad. It is joyous, it is gay.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have heard the old proverb: “Laugh and the whole world
laughs with you; weep and you weep alone.” They have changed this
proverb a little bit in the modern times. Now they say: “Laugh and the
whole world laughs with you; weep and you sleep alone.” But it is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>In the moment of laughter, suddenly you are one with the harmony of
existence. Weep... you have fallen apart, you are no more part of it. In
sadness, in seriousness, in despair, you are not in rhythm with
existence. In laughing, in dancing, in singing, in loving, you are in
rhythm with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no evolution – only rhythm or no rhythm. These are two
states, and they are available right now. You can be in rhythm, you can
be not in rhythm – that is the freedom of man. Trees are continuously in
rhythm, birds are continuously in rhythm. Man can choose. These are
different manifestations. Because you can choose, you have chosen the
wrong. And the wrong has an appeal – because by choosing the wrong, you
become important; by choosing the right, you disappear. And you have
been taught from the very childhood to be important, to be the first in
the world. You have been taught ambition, you have been poisoned to the
very core. So always you want to be important.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this U. G. Krishnamurti missed Sri Ramana – and something great
was happening. Almost like Buddha giving his flower to Mahakashyap, Sri
Ramana giving a joke book to a man who is asking</p><p>about God, or Ma Tzu giving a terrific kick in the pants. U. G.
Krishnamurti missed Ramana. Then he missed J. Krishnamurti too. He lived
for years with J. Krishnamurti.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, J. Krishnamurti is totally different in his expression, very
logical, very rational. The beginning of his work is always with the
mind; then slowly slowly he leads you beyond the mind, But there U.</p><p>G. Krishnamurti thought it was all abstraction, philosophy. He
stopped going there because “It is all abstraction.” He left Sri Ramana
because there was no philosophy. He left Krishnamurti because there was
too much philosophy. In both the cases he missed.</p><p><br></p><p>And he lived with Sri Sivananda of Rishikesh for seven years doing
yoga postures. There for seven years he thought, “Something is here.”
And there was nothing! Sivananda is a very ordinary teacher. You can
find dozens of them all around this country teaching people how to stand
on their heads, teaching people stupid things. There he remained for
seven years, became a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, he missed two pinnacles... and this is what goes on happening.
You have a mind, a certain mind. When you go to a master, you look from
your mind. If it fits, you are happy; you start clinging. But that is
not going to help – because it fits, it will strengthen the same mind
that you had brought with you. If by chance you come across a real
master, nothing is going to fit. He is going to disrupt all your ideas
about how a master should be; he is going to sabotage you. He is going
to take all expectations. He is to frustrate you, he is to disappoint
you in every possible way – because that is the only way real work can
start. And if you still can be with him, then... then you are going to
be awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep is easy, cheap; awakening is arduous. You will have to renounce
your dreams and you will have to re-nounce much comfort, much
convenience. You will have to renounce many ideas that you have always
thought very valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is that there is no evolution happening. The world is
exactly where it always has been, and will remain there. And I don’t
mean that things are not changing – bullock-carts have disappeared and
cars have come, and cars are on the way to disappearing sooner or later;
some private flying machines will soon be around.</p><p><br></p><p>Many things have changed, but really nothing has changed. At the
core, everything is exactly the same. Do you think that if you become
enlightened today you will be more enlightened than Buddha because
twenty-five centuries have passed and man has evolved? Do you think the
people who were there in Buddha’s days were more unenlightened than you
are? Or go still further back... Moses... or still further back...
Krishna. Do you think in the days of Krishna, five thousand years ago,
there were less enlightened people, more unenlightened people than there
are today? It is exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Time makes no difference! When you become enlightened, on what date,
will not be a decisive factor. When you become enlightened, you become
enlightened! You simply become aware. You are no more asleep. You
remember, you recognize your reality, and you are in tune. Cars may be
passing by, or bullock-carts – do you think it makes any difference?
Would Buddha have been more enlightened if cars’ had been passing by in
Bodhgaya and trains had been shrieking and aeroplanes had been rushing
from one airport to another? What happened to Buddha in Bodhgaya
twenty-five centuries ago would have been the same – bullock-carts or
cars or aeroplanes or spaceships make</p><p>no difference. And the people who were unenlightened were as
unenlightened as the people are today.</p><p><br></p><p>At THAT depth nothing ever changes, there is no evolution. Otherwise,
Buddha will have to Come back to become more enlightened this time...
and then there is no end. Then every time you become enlightened, after
a few centuries you have to come back and become more enlightened
be-cause now more sophisticated enlightenment is available.</p><p><br></p><p>At the deepest core nothing is changing. Only on the periphery do
things change.</p><p><br></p><p>OTHER TEACHERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION AS THE
AIM OF THE WORLD...</p><p><br></p><p>These people appeal because you want some longing, ambition, desire,
you want some passion, and these people supply you with it. Whatsoever
is demanded is supplied. Because you want something to cling to, they
give you spiritual commodities. You can’t remain without desires, so you
say, “Now I am no more interested in the world” – and they give you
other-worldly desires.</p><p><br></p><p>They say, “Okay, take this. Now worry about this. You have worried
enough about the world – now worry about meditation, now worry about
enlightenment. You have competed enough to reach to Delhi, now forget
about Delhi – reach moksha, nirvana, paradise... but go on
reaching!”</p><p><br></p><p>And you feel very happy – a new toy has been given to you and you
start playing with the new toy. Sooner or later you get fed up with that
toy, then some other toy has to be given to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, somebody had written a letter to me. In Germany,
somebody has invented a new kind... far superior to enlightenment – it
is called ‘transformation’. Now you have played with the word
‘enlightenment’ too long – now somebody is bound to come and say, “That
is nothing. Take transformation. Enlightenment is simply enlightenment –
we transform! We take you to another, a new formation. Enlightenment
means you remain the same and light comes to you. Transformation means
you become totally new.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this appeals. A new toy. Then somebody will come and will give
some other word. People go on playing with words. Beware!</p><p><br></p><p>I really want to do work here. I don’t want to give you any more toys
– I want to destroy all toys. It is going to be hard work. It is going
to be painful. But if you can move with me just one step, I ask only one
step: your dreams, your sleep, will have gone for ever... and then real
life starts. Real life is with the whole. Unreal life is alone.</p><p><br></p><p>ARE THESE TEACHINGS WRONG? Sat Bodhi has asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They are not right or wrong – they are simply illusory. You cannot
call them wrong even. They are not right, they are not wrong – they are
simply illusory. They have nothing to do with truth. They have something
to do with your mind. Your mind demands those things; somebody comes and
supplies you. It is a con game.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question</p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>DOES ANYTHING OR ANYONE NEED CORRECTION? IT PUZZLES ME.</p><p><br></p><p>PREM TUSHEER, NOBODY NEEDS CORRECTION. And who is going to correct?
The moment it is said that somebody needs correction, sooner or later
somebody is needed to dominate you, to manipulate you, to make a slave
out of you.</p><p>That’s why leaders down the ages have been calling and shouting from
the housetops that everything needs to be corrected, everything needs to
be changed? improved. If nothing needs to be corrected, they won’t be
leaders any more. They live on the idea that things need to be improved,
revolutions have to be done – then they are great leaders.</p><p>And nothing is ever improved, nothing can ever be improved. You can
either be fast asleep or awake. And awakening is not a correction,
remember. It is not correcting your sleep. If sleep is corrected that
will mean a few more tranquillizers are injected in you so that you can
sleep better. This is correction. New pillows, more comfortable; a new
bed, more convenient; a better bedroom... these are corrections so you
can remain asleep in a better way, so you can almost remain in a
coma.</p><p>Sleep does not need correction. Awakening is not a correction in
sleep – it is simply dropping sleep. It is moving into another kind of
reality, having a totally different kind of relationship with
existence.</p><p>Moralists, politicians, puritans, priests, they are always after you,
calling for correction. Everything needs to be corrected, every person
needs to be corrected – that is their power. The world is dominated by
politicians because of it. They always go on finding what has to be
corrected, and they always go on deluding you that now the correction
can be done. But there is only one way: if THEY are in power then the
correction can be done.</p><p>First they convince you that the correction is needed; then naturally
when you become convinced, the correction is needed. And why do you
become convinced? Because you are suffering – - suffering because of
sleep, not because of immorality; suffering not because of sin, but
because you are unconscious. And they come and they say, “This is why
you are suffering. A better morality, a better code of conduct, better
behaviour, a better character, and your suffering will disappear.”</p><p>And you start correcting yourself, and you cannot correct – you need
help, you need a priest, a guide to guide you. You need a leader! First
they convince you correction is needed, and then naturally they come by
the back door with all the paraphernalia to correct you. You become
slaves. That has been the trick down the ages. People have been
dominated; people have been reduced into things. People have been
condemned, people have been praised – but all the same they have been
dominated through condemnation, through praise.</p><p>This is the great conspiracy. I would like to tell you once and for
all: there is no need for any correction. You are not to be improved
upon. Then what is needed? Awakening is needed, not correction. Not
better morality, not better ethical conduct – no. Just consciousness.
And with consciousness, morality comes of its own accord.</p><p>In deep sleep, unconscious, how can you correct yourself? At the
most, you can have a little better dreams. Maybe not in black and white
– technicolour dreams, psychedelic dreams, but you can only have better
dreams in sleep. You cannot have reality in sleep.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>It was a dark, cloudy night and the drunk staggered into the cemetery
and fell into a hole which had been dug in preparation for a burial the
following day. The drunk hiccupped and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Half an hour later another drunk swayed into the cemetery. He was
singing loudly and his raucous voice woke up the drunk in the grave who
suddenly started to yell that he was cold.</p><p><br></p><p>The singing drunk tottered to the edge of the grave and peered
blurrily down at the complaining drunk. “It’s no wonder you are cold,”
he shouted down to the drunk, “you have kicked all the soil off
yourself!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what has been going on. You are asleep, your leaders are
asleep; you are asleep, your priests are asleep. The problem is not that
the man has kicked all the soil off himself<span class=s4></span>And
if this</p><p>other drunk starts helping, what do you think he will do? He will
throw the soil on him again.<span class=s4></span>“No</p><p>wonder he is feeling cold!” You need only one thing.</p><p>And corrections are millions, and still they never suffice. You put
one thing right on this corner, and something else goes wrong on another
– because your sleep keeps a certain balance. Have you not watched? You
stop smoking and then you start chewing gum. You stop one thing and you
have to start another. And it is the same old game! YOU only go on
changing things; you remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Corrections are millions. There is no end to them; you can go on
correcting and Correcting and you will never be correct. You will never
be right. You can put ALL the wrongs right, and you will find yourself
still wrong – because deep down you are still un.conscious, you don’t
know who you are.</p><p><br></p><p>The first and the only step is to know who you are, is to become
aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Timothy was on holiday in Ireland and staying at a small country inn.
One evening in the bar he was amazed by the following conversation:
“That’s a beautiful hat you’ve got there,” said an old man to a young
fellow who was standing next to him at the bar; “where did you buy
it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“At O’Grady’s,” replied the young man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why, I go there myself!” commented the old man. “You must be from
around these parts then?” “Aye. From Murphy Street.”</p><p>“Gracious!” exclaimed the old man. “I live there too!” “Quite
amazing,” commented Timothy to the barman. “that those two folk over
there live in the same street and have only just met.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t you believe it!” said the barman. “They’re actually father and
son but they’re always too drunk to recognize each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>No correction is needed, just awareness is needed. Become more alert.
No character is needed, because all character is false if you are not
conscious, and all character is a bondage if you are</p><p>not conscious. And all character is nothing but chains – it doesn’t
bring freedom. All morality is hypocrisy – if you are not aware, if you
are not conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>So, to me, religion means only one thing: to be more conscious, to
live more consciously. DOES ANYONE OR ANYTHING NEED CORRECTION? IT
PUZZLES ME.</p><p>It has puzzled everybody down the ages. Forget about correction. Put
your total energy into awakening. There are only two ways to be:
unconscious or conscious. Choose.…</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>“ENLIGHTENMENT IS MY TRUE NATURE; THERE IS NO NEED TO DO
ANYTHING.”</p><p><br></p><p>“ONLY WHEN EFFORT IS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AND ONE FEELS UTTERLY
USELESS DOES GRACE COME.”</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS ALL THIS? I AM CONFUSED. WHAT SHOULD I DO? SHOULD I CONTINUE
WITH MEDITATION OR SHOULD I JUST SIT AND LET THINGS HAPPEN?</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE GUIDE ME.</p><p><br></p><p>SHIV-PRIYANAND, IF YOU ARE CONFUSED then you will have tO continue
meditations. Confusion is the illness: meditation is medicinal. Both the
words – meditation and medicine – come from the same root. If you are
confused, you will have to go on meditating. When you see the point
without any confusion, then there is no need. But meditation will
prepare you, meditation will force you to see the point that there is no
need to do anything. Only meditation can do that.</p><p><br></p><p>Just listening to me... I have told you that to be natural is to be
enlightened. Now you think, “So, that is great! I can sit silently and
do nothing.” But can you really sit silently and do nothing? If you can
really sit silently and do nothing, then this question would not have
arisen. You would have sat and known and you would have bowed before me
and thanked me. There would have been no question. You would have come
dancing to me, not with a question and a confused mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can sit silently doing nothing, what else is needed</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Buddha was doing under the Bodhi Tree – sitting silently
doing nothing... and then it happened.That’s how it happened to me!
That’s how it always happens!</p><p><br></p><p>But not to do is not so easy. Because you have become so accustomed
to doing something or other, even sitting will be a doing to you. You
will have to force yourself in a yoga posture and you will sit strained,
still, in control, holding, trying to sit silently and not do anything –
and boiling within, to do a thousand and one things, and thousands of
thoughts will clamour around, will distract you.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you just sit and do nothing? That is the ultimate. That’s what
nirvana is, samadhi is.</p><p>It can happen; just listening to me also it can happen, but great
intelligence is needed then. Then, simply, you have seen the point –
that to be natural is all. Then where is the confusion? From where can
it come? Then what is the confusion? You have SEEN it, or you have not
seen it. If you WILL sit silently, you will walk silently, you will eat
silently, you will talk silently. You will become a non-doer, you will
become a natural being.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have not seen it, then you will need a few more crazy
things; you will have to go through them. Those meditations will force
you to see the point. Either you see just by listening and sitting by my
side, or you will have to see the hard way.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha meditated for six years, and meditated intensely, totally.
Then this realization arose in him: “What am I doing? Trees are
perfectly happy, birds are perfectly happy – what am I doing? And these
trees are not meditating, and these birds have never thought about
meditation, and they have not read Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, and they
don’t do yoga asanas and they don’t chant any mantras. And the whole
existence is so tremendously ecstatic! What am I doing standing on my
head and fasting and all that nonsense?”</p><p><br></p><p>He SAW it, but six years it took for him to see this. And he was no
ordinary man. He was tremendously intelligent. It took six years for him
to see the point. But the moment he saw it, he relaxed under the Bodhi
Tree. He fell asleep and the next morning he was awakened. Not only
physically he opened his eyes – spiritually his eyes were opened. Next
morning when he opened his eyes, he was totally a different man – the
real man had arisen. And just a glimpse of the real man, says Ikkyu, and
you are in love. And the moment he saw his real man, he started living a
life of compassion and love. There was no other way now, no choice. He
became a natural man.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if you feel confused, then go on meditating. Meditation is not
for enlightenment: meditation is for confused people. Meditation does
not lead you to enlightenment; it simply makes you fed up with your
confusion. Just see the point: meditation is not a way to enlightenment
– it is just a way to get rid of confusion. And when there is no
confusion, enlightenment comes of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation’s work is negative. It takes things away from you. It does
not give you anything; it simply goes on taking things away from you.
Anger disappears, greed disappears, desire disappears, and you start
losing whatsoever you had. You become every day poorer and poorer.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Jesus means when he says: Blessed are those who are poor
in spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger is not there, greed is not there, ambition is not there. Slowly
slowly, chunks of your being are cut from you. And one day suddenly
nothing is there – or, ONLY NOTHING IS THERE. That very moment, light
penetrates. All those things greed, anger, passion, lust, hatred,
ambition, ego – they were hindering the path. They were not allowing the
light to penetrate in you. They were functioning like a rock between you
and God. All those removed... suddenly God enters into you and you enter
into God.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand me, there is no need for any meditation. But if you
don’t understand me... to understand me meditation will be needed. Then
go on doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>I understand your confusion, your trouble. You can do it only if it
leads to enlightenment. That’s what your problem is. You have not said
it so clearly, but that’s exactly where the problem is. You can do</p><p>it if I emphasize that it will lead you to enlightenment – that I
cannot do, because that is not true. You want me to promise you so that
you can go on doing meditation. You want me to hypnotize you, you want
me to go on supporting your desires, your goals, that you want to become
enlightened, that you want to become natural... now look at the whole
absurdity of becoming natural! How can one become natural? NATURAL YOU
ARE! All becoming will lead you towards unnatural structures. Becoming
cannot bring you to being natural. Becoming means becoming
unnatural.</p><p><br></p><p>Natural you are, but you want me to support you because you cannot
sit silently. You cannot sit, really; you need something to think about,
something to do. You want some goal. And if I take the goal away you
ask, “Then why should I do meditation if it is not needed?” It is still
needed. Needed, not for enlightenment – needed just to destroy this
constant restlessness in your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like this: if you live in a room with closed doors the sun will
not penetrate, although opening the door is not creating the sun. By
opening the door you don’t create the sun – the sun is there. But by
opening the door, you become available to the sun. Meditations are just
like opening the door.</p><p><br></p><p>So right now if you sit, you will be sitting in confusion, and the
confusion will grow more and more if you sit. You will gather it; it
will become almost impossible to bear it. And you will have to go to the
movie or to the radio or the TV or to the club – you will have to go
somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditations are cathartic. They throw all the rubbish that you
contain inside. They simply cleanse you. They open the doors, they open
the eyes – the sun is there. Once you are available, it starts
penetrating you.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will never say, “I became natural.” You will say, “I was
natural. The problem was not how to become natural – the problem was how
not to go on becoming unnatural.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question Question 4</p><p>YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT THERE IS NO GOAL, NO PATH, NO ONE TO LEAD AND
NO ONE TO FOLLOW. IS THIS STATEMENT A LIE AGAIN? WERE YOU KIDDING US
YESTERDAY?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I am doing every day. That’s the only possible thing to
do. ALL statements are lies. Truth remains unstated. Truth cannot be
reduced to a statement, it cannot be reduced to a formula. It is vast!
How can you reduce it to a statement? The moment you state anything
about truth, the very expression becomes a barrier. Words cling around
truth like chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth can be transferred only in silence. So those who really listen
me, they don’t listen to what I say – they listen to what I am. They
listen to the gaps, they listen to the intervals. Words are not
important, but there are small gaps between words and the meeting
between you and me happens in those gaps.</p><p><br></p><p>Those gaps are of meditation. Slowly slowly, words move on the
periphery and my meeting, my communion with you becomes the center
phenomenon. Words are there, just distant, on the periphery. Silence
starts happening.</p><p>If you fall silent listening to me, then you have listened to me. If
listening to me your mind stops and there are moments when there are no
thoughts, all is still and quiet, then you have been listening to
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing me is one thing; listening to me is quite another. Those who
come near to me for the first time, they hear. And those who stay with
me for a longer time, slowly slowly the transformation happens. Hearing
starts changing into listening.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening is non-verbal. Then my presence is listened to – then
something is bridged between me and you. Then my heart and yom heart
start beating together in one rhythm. Then it is a song, a dance of
energies.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what in the East is called SATSANG – to be in the presence of
the master. It is not a verbal communication at all. Then why do I go on
speaking? Why can’t I sit silently here? That much silence you will not
be able to absorb. You can absorb it only in homeopathic doses, only
once in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>And my words help. They don’t state the truth, but they help, they
indicate; they are fingers pointing to the moon. They are not the moon
themselves, just fingers pointing to the moon, arrows. Don’t be obsessed
by the fingers, don’t start clinging to the fingers, don’t start
worshipping the fingers – because that is how you will miss the moon.
Forget the fingers and look at the moon.</p><p><br></p><p>That moon is silence, utter silence, where not even a single word has
ever been uttered.</p><p><br></p><p>You have that space inside you. I have become one with it; you are
not one with it. But once in a while, moving with me, flowing with me,
hearing my words, listening to my silences, once in a while it happens.
And those moments are of grace. In those moments you have the first
taste of God. Slowly slowly, you will become more and more capable.
That’s why I go on speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>And then new people are always coming. For them I have to speak. For
the older ones, slowly slowly they will not be bothered by my words.
Hearing will disappear completely. They will listen to my words just as
they listen to the sound of a waterfall They will not search for any
meaning in them. They will not search for any truth in them. They will
not search even for any coherence in them. They will not be constantly
looking into consistency, contradiction, logic, illogic – no, all these
things by and by disappear. They will listen to my words as they listen
to the songs of the birds, or the wind passing through the pine trees.
You don’t ask what the meaning is. You simply listen... and in that
listening you become that sound passing through the pine trees, you
become that wind.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever I say is a device so it is a lie. Truth has never been
said, cannot be said. Truth is unutterable. But you can listen to it. It
is unutterable, it can’t be said, but it can be listened to.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat: it cannot be uttered, but it can be listened to. You
can catch hold of it – in silence, in love, in communion. I am not able
to say it, but you are able to listen to it. Hence this device of
talking to you every morning, year in, year out. This is just a
waterfall... listen to it, don’t remain just hearing.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am so contradictory by arrangement. I manage it, because if I
am very consistent, you will never be able to listen to me, you will go
on hearing me. I am so contradictory – sooner or later you</p><p>are tired. You say, “What is the point? because this man is going to
say one thing this morning and tomorrow he is going to contradict it.”
Seeing it happening again and again.<span class=s4></span>You will
cling to my</p><p>statement and then tomorrow I contradict it, I have to contradict it.
Whenever I see that somebody is clinging somewhere to any of my
statements, I have to contradict it immediately – to relieve him of the
burden, to relieve him of his clinging, to relieve him of the words that
he has accumulated inside himself.</p><p>So I will go on, zigzag, contradicting myself a thousand and one
times. Slowly slowly, the understanding dawns on you that there is no
point in clinging to any words of this man, there is no need to bother
about what he says. But by that time you have fallen in love with me. By
that time you are in a totally different kind of relationship with me
than you have ever been with anybody else. By that time, you have
started enjoying my presence. By that time you have started imbibing me.
By that time you have started feeling the nourishment. Now you don’t
care what I say: now you care more that I am. Then listening has
started.</p><p>And you will understand me only by listening. You will understand me
only when you have forgotten all about understanding what I am saying.
All statements are lies. Lao Tzu is true. He says: Tao cannot be said,
and the moment you say it you have betrayed it. He is absolutely
true.</p><p>Truth is so infinite and words are so finite. Only when you have
something infinite in you.<span class=s4></span>silence is</p><p>infinite, unbounded – it can contain truth. Love is infinite,
unbounded – it can contain truth. Trust is infinite, unbounded – it can
contain truth.</p><p>Be natural, spontaneous here with me. Be in the moment, as if all
time and space has disappeared, as if the whole world has stopped. The
mind has stopped.<span class=s4></span>and suddenly there is truth in
all its</p><p>radiance, grandeur, splendour.</p><p><br></p><p>It is here, right this moment. If you have ears, hear it. If you have
eyes, see it. And if you cannot see it, and if you cannot hear it, then
don’t go on clinging unnecessarily here. I am in a hurry – I don’t want
any weeds here. I will find every possible means and ways to drop people
who are just sitting there like rocks. Either throb with me, or get
lost. Either be with me, or don’t be here. Because I MEAN to do
business!</p><p>The last question Question 5</p><p>I SEE I DON’T TRUST LIFE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. NOTHING FEELS POSSIBLE
UNLESS I DO. THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN TRUST HAPPENS, BUT WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO AT OTHER TIMES WHEN I DON’T FEEL IT? PRETENDING TRUST
SEEMS EVEN WORSE. LIVING IN FEAR FEELS NO GOOD EITHER.</p><p>Rupa, that’s how we go on creating new goals. I go on taking goals
from you and you go on creating new goals. Now one hundred percent trust
– now that becomes the goal. Ninety-nine percent and you are
worried.</p><p>Can’t you simply be as you are? Why bother about one hundred percent
trust? Trying to be one hundred percent when you are not is bound to
create hypocrisy. You will become artificial, you will become
unnatural.</p><p>And do you know what one hundred percent trust means? One hundred
percent trust means trusting even in your mistrust – that’s what one
hundred percent trust means. If there is a moment of untrust, you trust
that moment too! What can you do? One moment you trust me, good; another
moment you don’t trust me, good. This is one hundred percent trust. When
ALL is good it is one hundred percent trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are again trying to create trouble and anxiety for yourself.
One moment you trust me – good, you feel very good. Then another moment
comes distrust – now you are worried, now somehow you have to change
this distrust into trust. Now you are again starting a new ladder.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you will compare: “Somebody has one hundred percent trust – this
moment never comes to him. And somebody has even less trust than me” –
and you are becoming part of a hierarchy, you have started comparing.
And you are creating ambition and fever. And when it does not happen,
what are you going to do? And anything DONE by you will be unnatural. So
you will become artificial: when it is not there you will pretend. You
will at least believe that it is there – at least on the surface. You
will become afraid of going deep into yourself, because if you go deep
into yourself you will know that it is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>One hundred percent trust means: Accept life whatsoever it brings –
trust, mistrust, love, hate, God, Devil, good, bad. You don’t try to
change anything, don’t try to correct anything. Be in a let-go – that is
one hundred percent trust.</p><p><br></p><p>And let me remind you again, otherwise next day Rupa will be here
saying, “I can allow let-go sometimes, but sometimes it doesn’t happen.
The let-go is not one hundred percent.” LET-GO AGAIN MEANS THE SAME:
when it happens, it happens; when it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.
You are not supposed to do a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Do anything and you become artificial – and people have become so
artificial. It is very rare, very rare, to see even a small part in a
person which is not artificial. And it has all happened, this calamity
has happened, because you are such a great improver – continuously
improving upon yourself, correcting and correcting. From your very
childhood your parents were correcting you, then your teachers were
correcting you, then your professors were correcting you, your priests
were correcting you – the whole society has just been correcting you.
And, naturally, after twenty-five years of correction by everybody, you
yourself become a great correcter. Then you start correcting
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, you are allowed to leave the university only</p><p><br></p><p>hen you start doing the work of the parents and the teachers and the
professors and the priest on your own – then they allow. Then they say,
“Right, now there is no danger. This man will do whatsoever we were
doing, and will do it far better because he will know from the inside,
he will know the inside story.”</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not observed it? Sometimes doing something, suddenly you
hear your mother’s voice: “Don’t do it!” If you have not heard it, try
to hear, and you will find your mother still saying, “Don’t do it!”
ACTUALLY your mother’s voice you can hear, or your father’s, saying,
“This is wrong. This is not the way to do the thing. Correct it!” Or
your teachers correcting. They have created such a rift in you that you
have become two.</p><p>This WHOLE society exists in a kind of schizophrenia. Every person is
split. This society has tried the trick of divide and rule. It has
divided every person into two: the correcter and the one who has to be
corrected. So everybody has become like a small student and the
headmaster – both are there! And the headmaster with the cane shouting
and threatening, and the small child always being corrected. And of
course the small child also takes revenge. Whenever the headmaster is
not looking at the child, it does something – at least it can show his
tongue or laugh or joke. Or there are moments when the small child will
take possession of you and will force you to do something that you never
wanted to do, and will make you repent. It always says, “Yes, sir,” but
it never means it. It says, “Because I am afraid I am saying yes, but I
will show you.”</p><p><br></p><p>This constant conflict goes on within you. And then everything
becomes false, pseudo, phony. I have heard:</p><p>Groom: “Would you be very annoyed with me if I confess that all my
upper teeth are false?”</p><p><br></p><p>Bride: “Not at all, darling. At least I can now relax and take off my
wig, inflatable bra, glass eye and artificial leg.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what is left? Just watch what you are carrying around yourself,
what you think is your personality. What is it?</p><p><br></p><p>An American tourist, visiting England, had just enjoyed a delicious
dinner in a Winchester restaurant. “Would you like coffee, sir?”
inquired a waiter.</p><p>“Certainly,” replied the American. “Cream or milk?”</p><p>“Neither,” said the American firmly. “Just give me what I’m used to
back home: a pasteurized blend of water, corn syrup solids, vegetable
oil, sodium caseinate, carrageenan, guargum, disodium phosphate,
polysorbate 60, sorbitan monostearate, potassium sorbate, and artificial
colour.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what is left? Slowly slowly, everything becomes false,
artificial, synthetic, plastic. Then you lose the taste of life. And
when you lose the taste of life, you lose contact with God. When you
become inauthentic, you become uprooted.</p><p><br></p><p>Please don’t try anything upon yourself Stop trying. Let things be.
Let things be as they are. They are utterly beautiful. All ugliness is
created by you. Yes, sometimes mistrust is perfectly beautiful.
Sometimes doubt is good; it protects you from many foolishnesses. It
protects you from gullibility. Sometimes trust is good, sometimes no
trust is good. But whatsoever the case, THIS I call one hundred percent
trust – that you always say, “Good, so this is the thing in this moment.
So this moment God wants me to be trustful and this moment God wants me
to be doubtful.” Leave it to God, and you simply be at the receptive
end, a receptacle, and you will be surprised. Life will start happening
to you and God will start happening to you.</p><p><br></p><p>But we are trained very deep down from the childhood to be false, to
be untrue, to be formal.</p><p>An Englishwoman and her young son were travelling in a taxi in New
York. As the taxi passed a particularly seedy part of the city, the
small boy was fascinated by the garishly made-up ladies who were walking
along the streets accosting some of the male passers-by.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are those ladies doing?” asked the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother blushed and said, somewhat embarrassed, “I expect they are
lost and are asking people for directions.”</p><p><br></p><p>The taxi driver overheard this, and said in a loud voice, “Why
don’tcha tell the boy the truth – in udda woids they’re
prostitutes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman blushed even deeper red, and her son asked, “What are p...
p... pros... what the driver said? Are they like other women? Do they
have children?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course,” replied the mother. “That’s where New York taxi drivers
come from.”</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is not accepted anywhere. People are annoyed with truth. False
pretensions are very very acceptable. We have lived in lies so long that
truth simply annoys. It is not just an accident that Socrates is
poisoned – his only sin was that he was trying to make people aware of
the truth. His sin was nothing else. He was a simple, innocent man,
harmless, utterly harmless. He did not harm anybody in any way, but
still Athens was angry. Why were they angry? He was trying to make
people feel uneasy about their lies. He was trying to force them to see
the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Whosoever tries to make you aware of the truth is going to be thought
an enemy by the society. The society lives in lies, it depends on
lies.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not here to help in your lies. I can’t say to you to be one
hundred percent in trust or at least the way you mean by one hundred
percent. Then what will happen to those moments when you can’t trust?
What will you do? You will simply cover them up. You will pretend that
they are not there. You will throw them into the unconscious, in the
basement of your being, and will never look there. And they will
accumulate there and one day they will explode. No, that is not to be
done. When distrust comes, allow it to come, and know that it is there.
Accept it. It must have some meaning. If it is there, it must have some
meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like a thorn in the rosebush – not all are roses, a few thorns
are there. They protect the roses. There must be some deep harmony
between the thorn and the rose; so is there between trust and untrust.
Accept the harmony of polarities. This I call one hundred percent trust
– from my side. Trust everything that happens. Mistrust is included,
doubt is included, nothing is excluded.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you totality in life. And sometimes when you are not total,
that too is included in totality. Accept that too. And this will be a
liberation. Then there will be no more creation of chains, no more
creation of lies, no more repressions. And a man who is not repressed is
bound to have the glimpse of the real man.</p><p><br></p><p>One glimpse of the real man, and Ikkyu is right, you are in love.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

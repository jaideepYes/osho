‌CHAPTER 1
Back From the Leaky Road
11 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall A REST ON THE WAY BACK FROM THE LEAKY ROAD
TO THE NEVER-LEAKING ROAD;
IF IT RAINS, LET IT RAIN; IF IT BLOWS, LET IT BLOW. MY SELF OF LONG AGO,
IN NATURE NON-EXISTENT; NOWHERE TO GO WHEN DEAD, NOTHING AT ALL.
WHEN ASKED, HE ANSWERED; NO QUESTION, NO ANSWER; THEN MASTER DARUMA</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Only Man is Capable of Boredom
20 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT EXACTLY IS BOREDOM? IF I DON’T DO SOMETHING, EVEN SOMETHING NEEDLESS, A PANIC ARISES, A HUGE FEAR. WHAT IS IT THAT CAUSES THIS FRENZY OF MOVEMENT? WHY AM I SO UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS FEELING?
THE FRUSTRATION OF BOREDOM INCREASES WHEN I THINK THAT WHAT I WOULD DO IS EQUALLY A MEANINGLESS FRENZY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
The Lotus Flower of the Law
21 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
PITIFUL ARE
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW NIRVANA AND ITS ETERNAL FELICITY! HOW THEY GRIEVE
AT LIFE, DEATH, AND MUTABILITY! SHAKA, AND AMIDA TOO,
WERE ORIGINALLY HUMAN BEINGS; HAVE I NOT ALSO
THE FORM OF A MAN?
WONDERFUL, INDEED,
THE LOTUS FLOWER OF THE LAW! HOWEVER MANY AGES MAY PASS,</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Gladly Beyond any Experience
22 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
THOUGH YOUR LECTURE WAS QUITE SERIOUS AND DEEP YESTERDAY, THERE WERE STRANGE TICKLES AND LAUGHTER ARISING IN ME. SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN, THERE WAS A SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A SUBTLE UNDERCURRENT. TEARS OFTEN ROLLED DOWN!
DO THE MOMENTS OF CLARITY AND INSIGHT GIVE BIRTH TO SENSE OF HUMOUR?</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Daruma, the Cat and the Ladle
23 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall SINCE THE JOURNEY OF LIFE IS LITTLE BUT GRIEF AND PAIN,
WHY SHOULD WE BE SO RELUCTANT
TO RETURN TO THE SKY OF OUR NATIVE PLACE? TO WRITE SOMETHING AND LEAVE IT BEHIND US, IT IS BUT A DREAM.
WHEN WE AWAKE WE KNOW
THERE IS NOT EVEN ANYONE TO READ IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
I am Also a Plumber
24 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS A MYSTIC?
I don’t know, Purna, and nobody else knows either. That’s why a mystic is called a mystic. Something indefinable, something very elusive, something that cannot be grasped, that cannot be comprehended. Not that it is something special – it is very ordinary. That makes the mystery ten thousandfold.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Death in the Ego is Life in Love
12 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
YOU SAID YESTERDAY THAT SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE. IN THE WEST THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS TEACHING SCIENTIFIC MYSTICISM, AND THE PATHS OF TANTRA AND YOGA ARE ALSO VERY SYSTEMATIC. YOUR LITERATURE IS ALSO DEEPLY AND ARTISTICALLY RATIONAL. THERE SEEMS TO EXIST A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RATIONAL SCIENCE AND THE IRRATIONAL RELIGION.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
All Lies and Nonsense!
13 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
IF AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY THERE BE NO FINAL RESTING PLACE, HOW CAN THERE BE
A WAY TO LOSE OURSELVES IN? SHAKYAMUNI,
THAT MISCHIEVOUS CREATURE, HAVING APPEARED IN THE WORLD, MISLED, ALAS,
HOW MANY PEOPLE!
THE MIND –
WHAT SHALL WE CALL IT?
IT IS THE SOUND OF THE BREEZE</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Live Dangerously!
14 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
TODAY YOU SAID THAT THE WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT IS LONG AND ARDUOUS, AND ALSO THAT IT IS HERE AND NOW, NOW OR NEVER.
AS IT IS HERENOW, HOW CAN IT BE LONG AND ARDUOUS?
That’s why it is long and arduous – because you are not here-now. You are far away from here now.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
... And we are in Love
15 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
OF HEAVEN OR HELL WE HAVE
NO RECOLLECTION, NO KNOWLEDGE; WE MUST BECOME WHAT WE WERE BEFORE WE WERE BORN.
RAIN, HAIL, SNOW AND ICE
ARE DIVIDED FROM ONE ANOTHER; BUT AFTER THEY FALL,
THEY ARE THE SAME WATER
OF THE STREAM IN THE VALLEY. SHOULD YOU SEEK</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Cosmic Simultaneity of All
16 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
YOU SAID LIFE AND EXISTENCE HAVE NO GOAL, THEY ARE A PURPOSE UNTO THEMSELVES. OTHER MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE, SRI AUROBINDO, TEACH EVOLUTION AS THE AIM OF THE WORLD, EVOLUTION IN ALWAYS REACHING FOR STILL HIGHER LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS – FROM THE KINGDOM OF MINERALS TO THE KINGDOM OF VEGETABLES, ANIMAL, MAN, FROM PRESENT MAN TO ENLIGHTENED MAN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Whiskers of the Pebble
17 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
IF IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN;
IF IT RAIN NOT, LET IT NOT RAIN; BUT EVEN SHOULD IT NOT RAIN, YOU MUST TRAVEL
WITH WET SLEEVES.
LOOK AT THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS!
THEIR COLOUR AND SCENT FALL WITH THEM, ARE GONE FOR EVER,
YET MINDLESS
THE SPRING COMES AGAIN. BUDDHISM</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
In Search of a Ghost
18 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO FEEL A CERTAIN PULL NEAR OPEN WINDOWS, HIGH UP IN BUILDINGS. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I WORK NOW ALSO DO. THE FEELING IS: “IF I GO ANY CLOSER, I MAY HAVE TO JUMP.”
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT IS NOT SUICIDAL.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Do you smell the mountain laurels?
19 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
MY ABIDING PLACE HAS NO PILLARS; IT IS ROOFLESS –
YET THE RAIN DOES NOT WET IT, NOR THE WIND STRIKE IT.
WHEN IT BLOWS,
THE MOUNTAIN WIND IS BOISTEROUS, BUT WHEN IT BLOWS NOT,
IT SIMPLY BLOWS NOT. THOUGH IT HAS NO BRIDGE,
THE CLOUD CLIMBS UP TO HEAVEN; IT DOES NOT ASK AID</description>

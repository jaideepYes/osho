IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE INSIDE WITH YOU?

So don’t create a duality between you and me. Just try to be with yourself, just try to be your withinness, and you are with me!\nLanguage is not capable of saying anything about a non-dual reality. Whatsoever is said in language is bound to be dual. And when you are with me neither you are nor I am. Whenever you are really YOUR BEING you are a nobody, a vast emptiness a whole sky with no boundaries. And then you are not only with yourself you are with the trees, with the clouds, with the mountains, with the sands and with the seas... when you are with yourself you become the whole.\nThat is the meaning of the Socratic insistence: Know thyself. If you can know yourself you have know all that can be known – or that which is worth knowing. If you miss yourself you can know much, but all that knowledge is just rubbish. It may hide your ignorance, it cannot dispel it. It may make you knowledgeable but it will not make you understanding, it will not open the inner eye of knowing. You will remain a head person, top heavy, in deep anguish and anxiety.\nIf you want to be with me, to be with me is not the way. If you want to be with me, to be with yourself is the way. And that is the insistence of all the Buddhas: Know thyself and you will know me, because in knowing yourself you have known all.\nBut if you try to be with me you will create a duality, and a conflict. Then being with me will become a new sort of attachment. That won’t help you, that will really harm you and hinder you. Then I will not be helping you towards transcendence. Rather on the contrary I will become a rock hanging around your neck. You will not achieve through me then, you will be drowned.\nBut I will not be at fault; that will be your own fault. That has happened to millions of people all over the earth in all the centuries. A Jesus comes and people start being attached to him. The whole point is lost. A Buddha comes and people start their journey to know the Buddha and they become so much obsessed with it that they forget that their own Buddha is just inside themselves. He is not outside.\nAnd the way to know the outside Buddha is to know the inside Buddha. When you are completely within yourself you have known all Christs, all Buddhas, all the Masters that have ever existed, and also all those which will ever exist, because you become one with the whole. Knowing oneself one knows the whole.\nThe temptation is strong to be attached to a Master, to cling to a Master, to become a shadow; but that won’t help, that will be suicidal.\nDon’t cling to me, I am here to make you free. I am here to help you to be completely, authentically yourself.\nIf you have accepted me as your Master then you have to understand what I am saying. If you have accepted me as your Master then the only way for you is to know yourself.\nForget about me, move withinwards. One day when you will be standing in your own total glory, in the magnificence of your inner being, in the inner light – there you wi]l find me. Not as a separate being, not as an object, but as the very innermost core of your own self.\nIt is reported: Buddha was dying, and Anand started weeping and crying – his oldest disciple, and the most clinging one; for forty years he had been with Buddha and he had not attained, he had not realized himself yet; he loved Buddha too much. If you love too much... remember always, anything that is too much becomes part of the mind; only balance is transcending mind; anything that is too much becomes part of the mind; He loved Buddha too much, the love was not a freedom, it had become a bondage – anything of the too much is a bondage – and now that Buddha is dying his whole life is ruined. Anand cries and weeps like a small child whose mother is dying.\nAnd Buddha stops him and says: What, Anand, are you doing? He looks at Buddha with tear-filled eyes and says: Now where will I see you? Where will I seek you? And Buddha laughed and he said: That has been my whole teaching! For forty years that is what I have been telling you, that whenever you want to see me, look within! APPA DEEPO BHAVA; be a light unto yourself. THERE, inside you, you will find me.\nIf you cling to the outside, it may be a Buddha, a Jesus, but you cling to the world, because the outside is the world. You own innermost interior is the transcendental.\nMove withinwards and you come closer to me. Come closer to me and you go far from yourself. Try to understand this paradox: If you try to come closer to me you will go further from yourself, and\nhow can you come close to me if you are going further from yourself? Come closer to yourself and you come closer to me, because how is the otherwise possible?\nWhen you come closer to yourself you come closer to me because in the innermost being the centre is one. On the periphery we differ; on the periphery I am an individual, you are an individual; the move withinwards brings these peripheral points closer and closer and closer – and when you exactly reach to the centre of your being there is no duality. The two have disappeared. The TWONESS has disappeared.\nQuestion 2\nBAUL PANCHUCHAND SINGS: STRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH. YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED, HOMELESS, IN SPITE OF A HOMESTEAD AND YOUR LIFE WITH A GIRL. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT FOREVER MISLEADS. DO NOT ONLY THINK BUT CHAIN YOUR MASTER HAND AND FOOT. CUT OUT A CANE OF LOVE AND FLOG HIM TILL HE IS BLUE... THE MASTER MUST ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE...\nWILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS IN LAO TZUAN TERMS?\nBauls have been very extraordinary people. The word BAUL means MAD. Bauls were mad mystics. They have talked in all sorts of paradoxes; but very beautiful. They are not philosophers, they are mad poets. They are not proposing any logical thing, rather on the contrary ’they are trying to show you something through paradox.\nThis Baul, Panchuchand, is one of the greatest Bauls. He says: Strike your Master hard and worship in faith. This is what I was saying just now. If you want to come closer to me MOVE CLOSER TO YOURSELF. Forget me completely. Just remember your own being – and you will be moving towards me.\nThis Baul says: Strike your Master hard – destroy the duality of the Master and the disciple. Drop the Master completely Forget about him. STRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH. This is the paradox.\nAnd you can strike your Master hard only when you have really worshipped him in faith. If you really understand me only then will you drop your clinging to me. If you have really loved me you will not cling. Then whenever I come in your way – strike me hard.\nThat’s what Zen Masters have been saying to their disciples: If you meet Buddha on the way – kill him immediately! And they loved Buddha tremendously.\nIt happened, A Zen Master, Ikkyu, was staying in a temple. The night was very cold and he had no blankets – he was a beggar, and the whole temple was so cold – it was made of stones: stone coldness. In the night he couldn’t sleep, so he went in, into the shrine, found a Buddha, a wooden Buddha; burnt a fire with the Buddha; and enjoyed and delighted in the fire.\nThe sound of fire, the movement of this Ikkyu – and the priest became awake. Seeing the fire inside the temple he came running and when he saw that one of the Buddhas was missing (there were\nthree Buddhas in the shrine) and he looked at the fire – it was almost burnt – of course he was MAD; and he said to Ikkyu: What are you doing? Are you mad? You have burnt my Buddha! You have committed the greatest sin that a man can commit, and we were thinking that you are an enlightened man!\nThe fire was going down now; Ikkyu started to poke in the ashes.\nThe priest asked: What are you doing? He said: I am trying to find the bones of the Buddha so that they can be preserved. The priest started laughing, seeing the whole stupidity. He said: This is a wooden Buddha, there are no bones. You are really mad! Ikkyu said: Then bring the other two Buddhas also; the night is long and very cold.\nAnd in the morning – of course he was thrown out in the night, out of the temple, because he would burn the whole temple – in the morning when the priest came out of the temple Ikkyu was sitting just near the milestone on the road, and worshipping it.\nThe priest could not contain his curiosity. He asked: Now what are you doing, madman? Ikkyu said: I am worshipping the Buddha and every day in the morning that is my first thing to do.\nThis is the contradiction. But if you can SEE it is not a contradiction at all, it is a simple fact. A fact, the deepest fact of all mysticism.\nSTRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH. Love your Master so deeply that there is no clinging – you can kill, you can drop, the other disappears, the other is absorbed, only you in your crystal purity remain. But this is possible only if total faith is possible.\nOf course this Ikkyu must have loved Buddha tremendously, otherwise how is it possible to burn Buddha? How is it conceivable? He must have loved so totally that there was NO PROBLEM. He could burn the wooden Buddha.\nBuddha died. Mahakashyap, one of his greatest disciples, did not utter a single word: as if nothing had happened. He remained sitting under his tree. People were running here and there, there was much turmoil – Buddha has said he is leaving today! But this Mahakashyap never moved from his tree.\nMany people said: Mahakashyap, what are you doing? This is the last day! Buddha is leaving the body! It is said that he laughed and said: But who told you that he ever had a body? I know him. He has never been in the body. So what is the point of all this fuss? Let him leave it! He has never been in it. It is said that Mahakashyap told his disciples that Buddha was never born, never died, he never walked on the earth, he never uttered a single word; and every day in the morning Mahakashyap was worshipping the feet of Buddha.\nDifficult to understand, because you can understand hate which becomes destructive, you can understand love which becomes attachment, you cannot understand total love which is both, which destroys the non-essential and creates the essential.\nIF YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED... Very beautiful. But remember, to be unattached is not to renounce the world. If you renounce the world you are attached to the world;\notherwise why should you renounce it? What is the point in renouncing it if you are not attached to it? Only attachment renounces. If you are really non-attached there is no question of any renunciation.\nIF YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED, HOMELESS, IN SPITE OF A\nHOMESTEAD AND YOUR LIFE WITH A GIRL. Live in the house, be a householder: with your woman, your children – but remain unattached; because when you leave woman and children and house and you escape to the forest, you simply show that you were too much attached to all these things – otherwise why should you bother? And if you were attached how can attachment disappear by just going to the forest? It may become even greater because whenever things are not there you feel their need more.\nWhen you are hungry, you become food-obsessed. When you are on a fast you think only of food and nothing else. When you try to escape from your woman you will be sex-obsessed; you will think only of sex and nothing else.\nIf you wish to be devoted to God, if you really want to know the truth – live unattached, but LIVE. Unattachment should be a way of life, not a renunciation. Live unattached, but emphasis is on being in the world – live!\nDon’t try to commit a slow suicide – LIVE it through and through! Live unattached, homeless, in spite of the home; live in the home but homeless. Live with the family but as if alone. Move with the crowd but never become part of the crowd. Be in the marketplace but never lose your inner meditativeness.\nDO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT FOREVER MISLEADS. Why does the head mislead forever? In fact the head is not yours, that’s why it misleads. The head is a trick played by the society upon you. The head is like a mechanism attached to you by the society, imposed on you by the society.\nYou bring a heart with you, you don’t bring the head with you – it is conditioned and trained by the society.\nHave you ever thought that there is any possibility of a heart being a Mohammedan or being a Christian or a Parsee or a Hindu? The heart is simply the heart, but the head is a Hindu, head is Christian, head is a Mohammedan. The heart is not Indian nor Chinese nor American, it is simply human. But the head is Indian, Chinese, American...\nThe head belongs to the world, the heart belongs to you. The head is trained by the world, it is the world put within you. That’s why it misleads. It always says things which go against the innermost flow. It goes on diverting your energies, diverting your energies according to the society in which you have been brought up. The heart is natural, the head is social. The head comes from the crowd, the heart comes from the universe.\nDO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT FOREVER MISLEADS. DO NOT ONLY THINK BUT CHAIN YOUR MASTER HAND AND FOOT. CUT OUT A CANE OF LOVE AND FLOG HIM UNTIL HE IS BLUE – but it is a cane of LOVE – AND FLOG HIM UNTIL HE IS BLUE. THE MASTER MUST ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE...\nAbsurd sayings, but very beautiful. I have told you many times: it happened that Buddha, in a past life, when he was not a Buddha, heard about a man who had become enlightened. He went to see him. He touched his feet. Then suddenly he was surprised because that enlightened man, that Buddha, touched Buddha’s feet. Buddha said: What are you doing? I am an unenlightened ignorant man, a sinner – and you, touching my feet? I should touch your feet – that’s okay, but why are you touching my feet?\nThat enlightened man started laughing and he said: You may not be knowing it but you are also a Buddha. Sooner or later you will become a Buddha. You may not be able to see it but I can see it. Once you have become a Buddha you know the Buddhahood of the whole of existence. Then you never meet anything which is not part of Buddhahood, enlightenment. You look at a stone and you see a Buddha hidden there. In the greatest sinner you see the fulfilment of the greatest sainthood. In the greatest of evil you see the good sprouting. Once you are alert, aware, enlightened, the quality of the whole existence changes for you.\nTHE MASTER MUST ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE... Ordinarily the disciple\nbows at the feet of the Master – but that is in the visible world which can be seen by the eyes; in the invisible the Master is bowing at the feet of the disciple.\nWhen Jesus was leaving his disciples, the last night, when he was caught – and the next day he was murdered – he bowed down and touched the feet of all his apostles; even the feet of Judas he washed and kissed. And they were all surprised: This has never happened, what is he doing? He is bowing down to the future Buddhas. Even a Judas some day or other will become a Buddha, a Christ.\nAnd time does not matter much. Time matters only to the mind, but to a man who has gone beyond mind, time matters nothing. Somebody has become enlightened today, somebody will become enlightened tomorrow, somebody else the day after tomorrow – but it doesn’t matter to one who has attained to a no-mindness. It is eternity.\nSomebody asked Jesus: Why are you touching our feet? What are you doing? And Jesus is reported to have said: So that you remember that the Master had touched the feet of the disciples; so that you don’t become haughty so that you don’t become proud so that you don’t force people to touch your feet so that you remember that finally the Master has to just touch the feet of the disciple and has to bow down. Because in the disciple also the morning is hidden.\nIt may be a dark night still, but the darker the night the brighter the morning is going to be. It is just coming, it is just by the comer, you cannot see but the Master can see and he bows down to you – to the morning that is going to happen within you.\nThis Baul Panchuchand is really beautiful. Lao Tzu would have accepted him as a friend. Question 3\nWILL YOU COMMENT ON THE NATURE OF FEAR?\nFear is a negativity, an absence. This has to be understood very very deeply. If you miss there you will never be able to understand the nature of fear. It is like darkness. Darkness does not exist, it\nonly appears to be. In fact it is just an absence of light. Light exists; remove the light – there is darkness.\nDarkness does not exist, you cannot remove darkness. Do whatsoever you want to do, you cannot remove darkness. You cannot bring it, you cannot throw it. If you have to do something with darkness, you will have to do something with light, because only something which has an existence can be related to. Put the light off, darkness is there; put the light on, darkness is not there – but you do something with LIGHT. You cannot do anything with darkness.\nFear is darkness. It is absence of love. You cannot do anything about it, and the more you do, the more you will become fearful because then the more you will find it impossible.\nThe problem will become more and more complicated. If you fight with darkness you will be defeated. You can bring a sword and try to kill the darkness: you will only be exhausted. And, finally, the mind will think: Darkness is so powerful, that’s why I am defeated.\nThis is where logic goes wrong. It is absolutely logical that if you have been struggling with darkness and you could not defeat it, could not destroy it; it is absolutely logical to come then to the conclusion that darkness is very very powerful.I am impotent before it. But the reality is just the opposite. You are not impotent, darkness is impotent. In fact darkness is not there – that’s why you could not defeat it. How can you defeat something which is not?\nDon’t fight with the fear otherwise you will become more and more afraid: and a new fear will enter into your being, that is: fear of fear, which is very dangerous. In the first place fear is absence and in the second place the fear of fear is the fear of the absence of absence. Then you go into a madness.\nYou have taken a wrong step. Fear is nothing but absence of love. Do something with love, forget about fear. If you love well, fear disappears. If you love deeply, fear is not found.\nWhenever you have been in love with someone, ever for a single moment, was there any fear? It has never been found in any relationship – if even for a single moment two persons are in deep love and a meeting happens, they are tuned to each other, in that moment fear has never been found. Just as if the light is on and darkness has not been found There is the secret key: Love more.\nIf you feel there is fear in your being – love more. Be courageous in love, take courage. Be adventurous in love, love more, and love unconditionally, because the more you love the less will be the fear.\nAnd when I say LOVE I mean all the four layers of love: from sex to samadhi. Love deeply.\nIf you love deeply in a sexual relationship much fear will disappear from the body. If your body trembles in fear, it is the fear of sex; you have not been in a deep sexual relationship. Your body trembles, your body is not at ease, at home.\nLove deeply – a sexual orgasm will dispel all fear out of the body. When I say it will dispel all fear I don’t mean that you will become brave because brave people are nothing but cowards upside down.\nWhen I say all fear will disappear I mean there will be no cowardice and no bravery. Those are two aspects of fear.\nLook at your brave people: you will find that deep inside they are afraid, they have created just an armour around them. Bravery is not fearlessness, it is fear well-protected, well-defended, armoured.\nWhen fear disappears you become fearless. And a fearless person is one who never creates fear in anybody, and who never allows anybody to create fear in him.\nDeep sexual orgasm gives body at-homeness. A very very deep health happens in the body because the body feels whole.\nThen the second step is love. Love people – unconditionally. If you have some conditions in the mind then you will never be able to love – those conditions will become barriers. Because love is beneficial to you why bother about conditions? It is so beneficial, it is such a deep well-being that – love unconditionally; don’t ask anything in return. If you can come to understand that just by loving people you grow in fearlessness, you will love! For the sheer joy of it!\nOrdinarily people love only when their conditions are fulfilled. They say: You should be like this – only then will I love. A mother says to the child: I’ll love you only if you behave. A wife says to the husband: You have to be THIS way, only then can I love you. Everybody creates conditions; love disappears.\nLove is an infinite sky! You cannot force it into narrow spaces: conditioned, limited.\nIf you bring fresh air into your house and close it from everywhere – all the windows closed, all the doors closed – soon it becomes stale. Whenever love happens it is a part of freedom; then soon you bring that fresh air into your house – and everything goes stale, dirty.\nThis is a deep problem for the whole humanity. It has been a problem. When you fall in love everything looks beautiful, because in those moments you don’t put conditions. Two persons move near each other unconditionally. Once they have settled, once they have started taking each other for granted, then conditions are being imposed: You should be like this, you should behave like that – only then will I love: as if love is a bargain.\nYou don’t love out of your fullness of heart, you are bargaining. You want to force the other person to do something for you, only then will you love. Otherwise you will betray your love. Now you are using your love as a punishment, or as an enforcement. But you are not loving. Either you are trying to withhold your love or you are giving your love but in both cases love in itself is not the end; something else is.\nIf you are a husband then you bring ornaments to the wife – she is happy, she dings to you, kisses you; but when you don’t bring anything to the house there is a distance; she does not cling, she does not come near to you.\nWhen you do such things you are forgetting that when you love it is beneficial to you, not only to others. In the first place love helps those who love, in the second place it helps those who are being loved.\nAnd as I see it, people come to me, they always say: The other is not loving me. Nobody comes and says: I am not loving the other. Love has become a demand – the other is not loving me! Forget about the other! Love is such a beautiful phenomenon, if you love you will enjoy.\nAnd the more you love, the more you become loveable. The less you love and the more you demand that others should love you, the less and less you are loveable, the more and more you become closed, confined to your ego. And you become touchy. Even if somebody approaches you to love you, you become afraid, because in every love there is a possibility of rejection, withdrawal.\nNobody loves you – this has become an ingrained thought within you: how is this man trying to change your mind? He is trying to love you? – Must be something false; isn’t he trying to deceive you? Must be a cunning man, tricky. You protect yourself. You don’t allow anybody to love you and you don’t love others. Then there is fear. Then you are alone in the world, so alone, so lonely, not connected.\nWhat is fear then? Fear is a feeling of no contact with existence Let this be the definition of fear: a state of no contact with existence is fear. You are left alone, a child crying in the house, the mother and father and the whole family gone to the theatre. The child cries and weeps in his cradle. Left alone with no contact, nobody to protect, nobody to give solace, nobody to love; a loneliness, a vast loneliness all around. This is the state of fear.\nThis comes up because you are brought up in such a way that you don’t allow love to happen. Whole of humanity has been trained for other things, not for love.\nTo kill, we have been trained: and armies exist. Years of training to kill! To calculate, we have been trained: colleges, universities exist. Years of training just to calculate so that nobody can deceive you and you can deceive others. But nowhere is there any opportunity available where you are allowed to love – and love in freedom.\nIn fact, not only that, the society hinders every effort to love. Parents don’t like their children to fall in love. No father likes it, no mother likes it; whatsoever their pretensions no father, no mother likes their children to fall in love. They like arranged marriage.\nWhy? Because once a young man falls in love with a woman or a girl, he is moving away from the family, he is creating a new unit of family, his own family.He is against the old family of course, he is rebellious, he is saying: Now I am going away, I will create my own home. And he chooses his own woman; the father has nothing to do with it, the mother has nothing to do with it; they seem completely cut off.\nNo, they would like to arrange it: You create a home, but let us arrange it. So we have some say in it. And don’t fall in love – because when you fall in love the love becomes the whole world. If it is an arranged marriage it is just a social affair, you are not in love, your wife is not your whole world, your husband is not your whole world.\nSo wherever arranged marriage continues the family continues. And wherever love-marriage has come into being the family is disappearing.\nIn the West the family is disappearing. Now you can see the whole logic of why there is arranged marriage: the family wants to exist. If you are destroyed, if your very possibility of love is destroyed that is not the point; you have to be sacrificed for the family. If a marriage is arranged then a joint family exists. Then in a family a hundred persons can live – if marriage is arranged.\nBut if some boy falls in love or some girl falls in love then they become a world unto themselves. They want to move alone, they want their privacy They don’t want a hundred persons around: uncles and uncles’ uncles and cousins’ cousins and... they don’t want this whole market around; they would like to have their own private world. This whole thing seems to be disturbing.\nFamily is against love. You must have heard that family is the source of love, but I tell you family is against love. Family has existed by killing love, it has not allowed love to happen.\nThe society does not allow love because if a person is really in deep love he cannot be manipulated. You cannot send him to war; he will say: I am so happy! Where are you sending me? And why should I go and kill strangers who may be happy in their home? And we have no conflict, no clash of interests...\nIf the young generation. moves deeper and deeper in love, wars will disappear because you will not be able to find enough mad people to go to the war. If you love, you have tasted something of life; you would not like death and killing people. When you don’t love you have not tasted something of life; you love death.\nFear kills, wants to kill. Fear is destructive, love is a creative energy. When you love you would like to create – you may like to sing a song, or paint, or create poetry, but you would not take a bayonet, or an atom bomb, and go rushing off madly to kill people who are absolutely unknown to you, who have done nothing; who are as unknown to you as you are unknown to them.\nThe world will drop wars only when love enters into the world again. Politicians don’t want you to love, the society does not want you to love, the family doesn’t allow you to love: they all want to control your love energy because that is the only energy there is. That’s why there is fear.\nIf you understand me well drop all fears and love more and love unconditionlly – and don’t think that you are doing something for the other when you love, you are doing something for yourself. When you love it is beneficial to you. So don’t wait; don’t say that when others love, you will love – that is not the point at all.\nBe selfish. Love is selfish. Love people – you will be fulfilled through it, you will be getting more and more blessedness through it.\nAnd when love goes deeper fear disappears; love is the light, fear is darkness.\nAnd then there is the third stage of love – prayer. Churches, religions, organized sects – they teach you to pray. But in fact they hinder you from praying because prayer is a spontaneous phenomenon, it cannot be taught. If you have been taught a prayer in your childhood you have been debarred from a beautiful experience that may have happened. Prayer is a spontaneous phenomenon.\nI must tell you one story I love. Leo Tolstoy has written a small story: In a certain part of old Russia there was a lake, and it became famous because of three saints. The whole country became interested. Thousands of people were going and journeying to the lake to see those three saints.\nThe arch-priest of the country became afraid: What is happening? He had not heard these ‘saints’ and they had not been certified by the church; who has made them saints?\nThis Christianity has been doing one of the most fooish things; they give certificates: This man is a saint. As if you can make a man a saint by certifying him!\nBut the people were mad, and much news was coming that miracles were happening, so the priest had to go and see what the matter was.\nHe went in a boat to the island where those three poor people lived; they were simply poor people, but very happy – because there is only one poverty, and that poverty is a heart which cannot love. They were poor, but they were rich: the richest you could ever find; they were happy sitting under a tree laughing, enjoying, delighting.\nSeeing the priest they bowed down, and the priest said: What are you doing here? There are rumours that you are great saints. Do you know how to pray? – because seeing these three persons the priest could immediately sense that they were completly uneducated; a little idiotic, Lao Tzuan. Happy but foolish.\nSo they looked at each other and they said: Sorry sir, we don’t know the right prayer authorized by the church because we are ignorant. But we have created one prayer of our own – it is homemade. If you won’t feel offended we can show it to you.\nSo the priest said: Yes, show it to me, what prayer you are doing. So they said: We tried and thought and thought – but we are not great thinkers, we are foolish people, ignorant villagers; then we decided upon a simple prayer. In Christianity God is thought of as a trinity, three: God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. And we are also three. So we decided on a prayer: You are three, we are three, have mercy upon us. This is our prayer. We are three, you are also three, have mercy on us.\nThe priest was very very angry, almost enraged. He said: What nonsense! We have never heard any prayer like this. Stop it! This way you cannot be saints. You are simply stupid. They fell at his feet and they said: You teach us the real, the authentic prayer.\nSo he told them the authorized version of the prayer of the Russian Church. It was long, complicated; big words, bombastic, those three persons looked at each other – it seemed impossible, the door of heaven was closed for them.\nThey said: You please tell us once more, because it is long, and we are uneducated. He said it again. They said: Once more sir, because we will forget, and something will go wrong. So again he told it. They thanked him heartily and he felt very good that he had done a good deed: brought three foolish people back to the church.\nHe sailed off in his boat – just in the middle of the lake he could not believe his eyes: those three persons, those foolish people, were coming running on the water. They said: Wait! Once more! We have forgotten! Now this was impossible to believe!\nThe priest fell at their feet and he said: Forgive me. You continue your Prayer.\nThe third love energy is prayer. Religions, organized churches, have destroyed it. They have given you readymade prayers. Prayer is a spontaneous feeling.\nRemember this story when you pray. Let your prayer be a spontaneous phenomenon. If even your prayer cannot be spontaneous, then what will be? If even with God you have to be readymade then where will you be authentic and true and natural?\nSay things that you would like to say. Talk to him as you would talk to a wise friend. But don’t bring formalities in. A formal relationship is not a relationship at all. And you have become formal with God also. You miss all spontaneousness.\nBring love into prayer. Then you can talk! It is a beautiful thing – a dialogue with the universe.\nBut have you watched? If you are really spontaneous, people will think you arc mad. If you go to a tree and start talking, or to a flower, a rose, people will think you are mad. If you go to the church and talk to the cross or to the image, nobody will think you are mad, they will think you are religious. You are talking to a stone in the temple and everybody thinks you are religious because this is the authorized form.\nIf you talk to a rose – which is more alive than any stone image, which is more divine than any stone image; if you talk to a tree – which is more deeply rooted in God than any cross, because no cross has roots, it is a dead thing that’s why it kills; a tree is alive, with roots deep into the earth, branches high into the sky, connected with the whole, with the rays of the sun, with the stars – talk to the trees! That can be a contact point with the divine, but if you talk that way people will think you are mad.\nSpontaneousness is thought to be madness. Formalities are thought to be sanity. Just the opposite is the reality. When you go into a temple and you simply repeat some crammed prayer you are simply foolish. Have a heart-to-heart talk! And prayer is beautiful. You will start flowering through it. Prayer is to be in love – to be in love with the whole. And sometimes you get angry with the whole and you don’t talk; that?s beautiful. And you say: I will not talk, enough is enough, and you have not been listening to me! A beautiful gesture. Not dead. And sometimes you drop praying completely, because you go on praying and God is not listening.\nIt is a relationship with deep involvement in it. You get angry. Sometimes you feel very good, feel thankful, grateful; sometimes you feel put off; but let it be a LIVING relationship; then prayer is true.\nIf you just go on like a gramophone and repeat the same thing every day, you are not doing any prayer, it is not prayer.\nI have heard about an advocate who was a very calculating man. Every night he would go to bed, look at the sky and say: Ditto. Just like the other days. And go to sleep. Only once he prayed – the\nfirst time in his life – and then: Ditto. It was like a legal thing; what was the point in saying the same prayer again?\nWhether you say ditto or you repeat the whole thing it is the same. Prayer should be a lived experience, a heart-to-heart dialogue. And soon, if it is hearty, you will feel that not only are you talking, but the response is there. Then prayer has come into its own, come of age. When you feel the response, that not only you are talking – if it is a monologue it is still not prayer – it becomes a dialogue, you not only speak, you listen.\nAnd I tell you the whole existence is ready to respond. Once your heart is open the whole responds.\nThere is nothing like prayer. No love can be as beautiful as prayer. Just as no sex can be as beautiful as love no love can be as beautiful as prayer.\nBut then there is the fourth stage which I call meditation. There dialogue also ceases. Then you have a dialogue in silence. Words drop, because when the heart is really full you cannot speak. When the heart is too overflowing only silence can be the medium. Then there is no other. You are one with the universe. You neither say anything nor listen to anything. You ARE with the one, with the universe, with the whole. A oneness. This is meditation.\nThese are the four stages of love, and on each stage there will be a disappearance of fear. If sex happens beautifully the body fear will disappear. The body will not be neurotic. Ordinarily – I have observed thousands of bodies – they are neurotic. Bodies gone mad. Not fulfilled. Not at home.\nIf love happens, fear will disappear from the mind. You will have a life of freedom, at ease, at- homeness. No fear will come, no nightmares.\nIf the prayer happens then fear completely disappears, because with prayer you become one – you start feeling a deep relationship with the whole. From the spirit, fear disappears; the fear of death disappears when you pray – never before it.\nAnd when you meditate even fearlessness disappears. Fear disappears, fearlessness disappears. Nothing remains. Or. only the nothing remains. A vast purity; virginity; innocence.\nQuestion 4\nIF I AM TO BE MY BROTHER’S KEEPER, HOW FAR DOES MY RESPONSIBILITY GO?\nNo, you are not. Nobody is. Nobody is meant to be anybody’s keeper. You are here to be yourself. Your only responsibility is towards yourself.\nI would like you to be totally selfish because only in that is there a possibility that you may be helpful to others. Unless you are deeply self-centred, unless you are so selfish in your being that you are happy, celebrating, you will not be able to share it.\nHumanity has been put on the wrong track by altruists, by people who say: Serve others, you are responsible for others. Nobody is responsible for anybody. The only responsibility is towards yourself. And if you are fulfilled in that responsibility you respond beautifully.\nA really fulfilled husband will love his wife, because out of his fulfilment love flows. But if he thinks he has to fulfil responsibilities, he has a duty to care because he has got married to this woman, then he will be killing his woman, poisoning the woman, because this very attitude is poisonous. He will be dragging the weight, and with his every gesture he will be showing that he is not satisfied. With every gesture he will go on hinting to the woman: You are a heavy weight on me.\nYour mother is old; if you have really a deeprooted centring within you you will love and serve her – not because this is your responsibility, no, but because this is how it happens to be. You enjoy serving the old woman. You love it! It is simple. You are not being a martyr, you are not trying to sacrifice yourself – remember always whenever you are a martyr you can never forgive the person for whom you have been a martyr. You will carry the wound, and you would like to take revenge. But the whole world has been trained: the father has to fulfil his duties to the children, then those children never forget and never forgive the father.\nNow one of the greatest insights that has come to Western psychology is that children never forgive their parents. This seems to be ridiculous because parents have been doing so much; but the very idea that ‘I am doing so much’ is a crippling thing, heavy. The father goes on saying: I am sacrificing for you. This is simply stupid. Nobody is sacrificing for anybody else.\nIf you love the children – you work, if you don’t love – you don’t work. It is better that the children should die than they should live a burdened life. If you love your wife – you love, and there is no question of any responsibility. If you don’t love, be frank and be true. Don’t love her. Somebody else may love her, why waste her life and your life?\nNow in the West out of four marriages one marriage is absolutely broken in divorce. That means twenty-five per cent of marriages break up in divorce. Now psychoanalysts have been trying to do some research: what happens to the other three? They have come to feel that out of four, one breaks up in divorce, and out of four, two are unlived marriages: living together yet not together. Out of four, one breaks, two are continued; divorce is not given but the situation is of divorce – they live in divorce, not separate, not together. Only one they suspect is a marriage, only one out of four – and that too is SUSPECTED only, certainty is not there.\nWhy is this happening? The basic point has been missed. The basic point is a man can love others only when he loves himself. A man can share his feelings with others only when he has something to SHARE.\nFirst be selfish, only then can you be unselfish. Be rooted and centred in your being, so overflowing that out of your overflowingness you share. Not that you are a martyr. Never become a sacrifice, otherwise you will never be able to forgive those people who forced you to become a sacrifice.\nNo, nobody is anybody’s keeper. The only responsibility is towards yourself. This will look as if I am teaching selfishness. Yes, I am teaching it. If everybody in the world was selfish the world would be beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Just think – everybody trying to be happy, everybody trying to be celebrating, everybody trying to be silent, meditative, prayerful, loving – because these are the things which will make you happy; the world will be happy.\nBut here, nobody is trying to be happy himself. People are trying to make others happy. And if you are not happy how can you make others happy? You make them more unhappy. Public servants\nwho are trying to change others’ lives so that they can become happy, are the most mischievous people in the world. Who are you to make anybody happy? If they want to be unhappy please let them be unhappy. At least that is their right! To be happy or unhappy is one’s right. You keep to yourself.\nYou become unhappy if you want, you become happy if you want. Nobody wants to be unhappy and nobody will be unhappy if he looks to his own affairs, pays attention to his own affairs. A world absolutely selfish will be the best world possible.\nThat’s why I am against communism and all socialistic tendencies. Because they kill the individual. They sacrifice the individual for the society, for the state. They say: For the country you have to die. For the religion you have to die. For the good of all you have to die – and they go on saying this to everybody, and everybody is dying – and for nobody!\nAnd everybody is unhappy trying to make everybody else happy. It is not possible – you cannot make anybody happy. In fact you cannot make anybody unhappy either. The most that can be done, that which is humanly possible, is to be happy or unhappy. Decide that. That’s all. And out of that, beautiful things start happening.\nWhen your house is lighted, when you have a fragrance of happiness, suddenly your fragrance enters into others’ lives, changes them, transforms them, without any mind on your part to transform them.\nQuestion 5\nDO WE HAVE MISSIONS TO FULFIL?\nNo, nobody has any mission to fulfil. Missionaries are dangerous people. They have done enough harm. You have to fulfil yourself. No mission.\nLet God take care of others. You just fulfil your own being. Don’t try to convert anybody. Don’t try to be a do-gooder, and don’t think that you have a mission and everybody else has to follow it.\nThat’s how the whole world has been suffering for so many centuries. So many missionaries creating so much conflict; pushing and pulling people from here and there. Leave them in peace!\nNobody has any mission to fulfil – but ego always wants such things: that you have a mission to fulfil. People come to me and they say: Why has God given birth to me? Very important people. God has given special work to them. And I ask them: Just go and ask the trees and the dogs and the cats: they must also be asking – WHY has God given birth to us? Mi]lions and millions of animals are there with no mission.\nIn your body there are millions of germs – with no mission. If you put twenty-seven zeros on the figure five – that is the calculation of living cells in your body; and they are completely oblivious of you – that you exist. They live their own life, they move in the bloodstream, they enjoy, they love, they fall in love, they get married, they give birth to children, they fulfil their duties – they must be thinking they have some mission to fulfil\nWhat are you in this vast universe? Not even a small cell.\nBut man is very egoistic. He cannot feel at ease just to be himself, he wants some great mission to be attached to his ego. No, I don’t see any mission. The whole may have something but no individual has.\nSo the only thing you can do is to be yourself, blissfully yourself, and through that blissfulness you fulfil something. But it is not that you fulfil it, it is fulfilled through you; you become a vehicle to the whole. But it is not a mission. You should not look at it and you should not bother about it.\nBe ordinary. Just the effort to be extraordinary is a sort of madness. Just be ordinary and you are divine. Try to become extraordinary and you are mad.\nQuestion 6\nDO YOU BELIEVE MANKIND WILL SOME DAY EVOLVE INTO A HIGHER PLANE – A WORLD FREE FROM WAR, INJUSTICE, ETC.?\nI don’t think of the morrow at all, of what will happen tomorrow. People who will be here tomorrow – they will think about it. This moment is enough for me. And this is the only moment we can live, you cannot live in the future. Don’t waste your time on it.\nAnd don’t be worried about mankind: you will never meet anywhere any mankind or humanity; all that you will meet will be human beings. Humanity is an abstraction; non-existential; just a word. Don’t be bothered about it.\nYou have a small life span; you will be living with human beings; just see how you can live so you can be fulfilled. Whether in the future there will be wars or not, who are we to decide? And why should we bother?\nBut there are utopians who go on thinking about the future. They miss their lives in thinking about the future. And that future never comes. The word utopia means: that which never comes.\nGo on thinking about it: a world without wars, without famine, without poverty, but what is the point? – you are dreaming! Rather, be more realistic. Create a human being inside you who has no warring tendencies, no conflicting tendencies, no violence, no aggression; that’s all that can be done. That is feasible.\nCreate a human being within, don’t think about human kind. How can you manage that? That is not possible. Leave all that to foolish politicians. They will think about it.\nYou can do something for the human being that you are. Drop all conflicting tendencies: violence, aggression, fear – be loving, prayerful, meditative. Create at least one human being as you would like the whole humanity to be. At least create a model within you so that your fragrance spreads and gives a vision to people that this too is possible, that man IS divine.\nLove more. Delight more, celebrate more, dance more, sing more: that’s all that you can do. Leave a dream around you – actualized. If somebody loves it, he may follow. I cannot say that the whole humanity will follow – it is such a vast thing.\nAnd there is no need of that because your happiness may not be others’ happiness. Your singing may be just noise for somebody else. Your dance may be nothing but a nuisance. So who is to decide? Don’t take the responsibility that you will decide for the whole – no.\nYou drop out of these roles of decider. You are not the decider. You simply live your life in the small corner that you have got. Whatsoever you can do for yourself, DO IT. And if somebody feels good, attracted, magnetized – help him, but out of love, not out of any missionary spirit. That is poison.\nQuestion 7\n‘IF YOU MEET A BUDDHA ON THE ROAD, KILL HIM IMMEDIATELY!’ – WHAT ABOUT YOU? HOW DO I BOTH LOVE YOU AND KILL YOU.\nDo the same to me. First try to find me and then when you have found me – kill me immediately. Because that’s how you will attain to your own perfection.\nEven if I am there the duality will remain. An object in the mind is a disturbance. Drop that object also. When you have killed me you have completely followed me. When I have disappeared only then will you be grateful to me. Only then will you understand that the work of the Master is very contradictory.\nFirst he has to create a situation in which you fall in love with him. He has to create a situation in which you start allowing him to guide you. This is the first part. When it starts functioning he has to create a situation in which you have to drop him.\nIt is just like a ladder: you go on the ladder – first you have to move on the ladder, cling to the ladder, and then you have to leave the ladder. If you go on clinging to the ladder then the whole point is missed.\nThe ladder is not the goal. You only want it to reach some other plane of being. The ladder helped from one plane to another, but if you cling to the ladder, at the last moment you say: I cannot leave this ladder because it has helped me so much, and I am so grateful, how can I leave it? Then the whole point is missed.\nThe ladder is not the goal.\nBuddha used to say that once it happened: Five idiots were travelling. They came to a big river. They purchased a small boat. They crossed the river. Then they thought: This boat is wonderful. It has helped us to come across the river, otherwise it would not have been possible for us to cross it. So we should be grateful to it.\nSo they carried the boat on their heads into the marketplace.\nPeople enquired: What is the matter? Why are you carrying this boat? They said: We are very grateful. This boat helped us to cross the river otherwise we would still have been on the other shore. Now we can never leave it!\nBuddha said: Always remember that the Master is a boat. Cross the river, but don’t carry the boat on the head otherwise one who was going to free you will become your bondage.\nThat’s how when a boat is carried, the boat of Christ is carried, you become a Christian, not a Christ. If you drop the boat you become a Christ; if you carry the boat you become a Christian. If you drop the boat of Buddha you become a Buddha yourself; if you carry the boat you become a Buddhist. Which is foolishness.\nSo don’t be one of those five idiots.\nLove me only to drop me one day. And love me so deeply that you can drop without any grudge without any clinging without any complaint.\nIt looks difficult because you can understand love only in terms of attachment. You don’t know that love is deep unattachment. You can understand love only as possessiveness. You don’t know that love is the greatest freedom, non-possessiveness.\nIf you allow me to create the situation and you don’t create resistance, first you will start clinging to me – that’s how the journey starts, one has to enter the boat. But when the other shore is reached I will be the first to tell you to leave the boat completely and forget about it. The purpose is fulfilled. You move ahead.\nThe last step has to be taken in the divine, in God, and the Master has to be dropped. The Master is naught but a door.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9647","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_4/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_4/>Tao.

way to be with me. So don’t create a duality between you and me. Just
try to be with yourself, just try to be your withinness, and you are
with me!</p><p><br></p><p>Language is not capable of saying anything about a non-dual reality.
Whatsoever is said in language is bound to be dual. And when you are
with me neither you are nor I am. Whenever you are really YOUR BEING you
are a nobody, a vast emptiness a whole sky with no boundaries. And then
you are not only with yourself you are with the trees, with the clouds,
with the mountains, with the sands and with the seas... when you are
with yourself you become the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of the Socratic insistence: Know thyself. If you
can know yourself you have know all that can be known – or that which is
worth knowing. If you miss yourself you can know much, but all that
knowledge is just rubbish. It may hide your ignorance, it cannot dispel
it. It may make you knowledgeable but it will not make you
understanding, it will not open the inner eye of knowing. You will
remain a head person, top heavy, in deep anguish and anxiety.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to be with me, to be with me is not the way. If you want
to be with me, to be with yourself is the way. And that is the
insistence of all the Buddhas: Know thyself and you will know me,
because in knowing yourself you have known all.</p><p>But if you try to be with me you will create a duality, and a
conflict. Then being with me will become a new sort of attachment. That
won’t help you, that will really harm you and hinder you. Then I will
not be helping you towards transcendence. Rather on the contrary I will
become a rock hanging around your neck. You will not achieve through me
then, you will be drowned.</p><p><br></p><p>But I will not be at fault; that will be your own fault. That has
happened to millions of people all over the earth in all the centuries.
A Jesus comes and people start being attached to him. The whole point is
lost. A Buddha comes and people start their journey to know the Buddha
and they become so much obsessed with it that they forget that their own
Buddha is just inside themselves. He is not outside.</p><p><br></p><p>And the way to know the outside Buddha is to know the inside Buddha.
When you are completely within yourself you have known all Christs, all
Buddhas, all the Masters that have ever existed, and also all those
which will ever exist, because you become one with the whole. Knowing
oneself one knows the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The temptation is strong to be attached to a Master, to cling to a
Master, to become a shadow; but that won’t help, that will be
suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t cling to me, I am here to make you free. I am here to help you
to be completely, authentically yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have accepted me as your Master then you have to understand
what I am saying. If you have accepted me as your Master then the only
way for you is to know yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Forget about me, move withinwards. One day when you will be standing
in your own total glory, in the magnificence of your inner being, in the
inner light – there you wi]l find me. Not as a separate being, not as an
object, but as the very innermost core of your own self.</p><p><br></p><p>It is reported: Buddha was dying, and Anand started weeping and
crying – his oldest disciple, and the most clinging one; for forty years
he had been with Buddha and he had not attained, he had not realized
himself yet; he loved Buddha too much. If you love too much... remember
always, anything that is too much becomes part of the mind; only balance
is transcending mind; anything that is too much becomes part of the
mind; He loved Buddha too much, the love was not a freedom, it had
become a bondage – anything of the too much is a bondage – and now that
Buddha is dying his whole life is ruined. Anand cries and weeps like a
small child whose mother is dying.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha stops him and says: What, Anand, are you doing? He looks
at Buddha with tear-filled eyes and says: Now where will I see you?
Where will I seek you? And Buddha laughed and he said: That has been my
whole teaching! For forty years that is what I have been telling you,
that whenever you want to see me, look within! APPA DEEPO BHAVA; be a
light unto yourself. THERE, inside you, you will find me.</p><p><br></p><p>If you cling to the outside, it may be a Buddha, a Jesus, but you
cling to the world, because the outside is the world. You own innermost
interior is the transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>Move withinwards and you come closer to me. Come closer to me and you
go far from yourself. Try to understand this paradox: If you try to come
closer to me you will go further from yourself, and</p><p>how can you come close to me if you are going further from yourself?
Come closer to yourself and you come closer to me, because how is the
otherwise possible?</p><p><br></p><p>When you come closer to yourself you come closer to me because in the
innermost being the centre is one. On the periphery we differ; on the
periphery I am an individual, you are an individual; the move
withinwards brings these peripheral points closer and closer and closer
– and when you exactly reach to the centre of your being there is no
duality. The two have disappeared. The TWONESS has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BAUL PANCHUCHAND SINGS: STRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH.
YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED, HOMELESS, IN SPITE OF A
HOMESTEAD AND YOUR LIFE WITH A GIRL. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT
FOREVER MISLEADS. DO NOT ONLY THINK BUT CHAIN YOUR MASTER HAND AND FOOT.
CUT OUT A CANE OF LOVE AND FLOG HIM TILL HE IS BLUE... THE MASTER MUST
ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE...</p><p><br></p><p>WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS IN LAO TZUAN TERMS?</p><p><br></p><p>Bauls have been very extraordinary people. The word BAUL means MAD.
Bauls were mad mystics. They have talked in all sorts of paradoxes; but
very beautiful. They are not philosophers, they are mad poets. They are
not proposing any logical thing, rather on the contrary ’they are trying
to show you something through paradox.</p><p><br></p><p>This Baul, Panchuchand, is one of the greatest Bauls. He says: Strike
your Master hard and worship in faith. This is what I was saying just
now. If you want to come closer to me MOVE CLOSER TO YOURSELF. Forget me
completely. Just remember your own being – and you will be moving
towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>This Baul says: Strike your Master hard – destroy the duality of the
Master and the disciple. Drop the Master completely Forget about him.
STRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH. This is the paradox.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can strike your Master hard only when you have really
worshipped him in faith. If you really understand me only then will you
drop your clinging to me. If you have really loved me you will not
cling. Then whenever I come in your way – strike me hard.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Zen Masters have been saying to their disciples: If you
meet Buddha on the way – kill him immediately! And they loved Buddha
tremendously.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, A Zen Master, Ikkyu, was staying in a temple. The night
was very cold and he had no blankets – he was a beggar, and the whole
temple was so cold – it was made of stones: stone coldness. In the night
he couldn’t sleep, so he went in, into the shrine, found a Buddha, a
wooden Buddha; burnt a fire with the Buddha; and enjoyed and delighted
in the fire.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of fire, the movement of this Ikkyu – and the priest became
awake. Seeing the fire inside the temple he came running and when he saw
that one of the Buddhas was missing (there were</p><p>three Buddhas in the shrine) and he looked at the fire – it was
almost burnt – of course he was MAD; and he said to Ikkyu: What are you
doing? Are you mad? You have burnt my Buddha! You have committed the
greatest sin that a man can commit, and we were thinking that you are an
enlightened man!</p><p><br></p><p>The fire was going down now; Ikkyu started to poke in the ashes.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest asked: What are you doing? He said: I am trying to find
the bones of the Buddha so that they can be preserved. The priest
started laughing, seeing the whole stupidity. He said: This is a wooden
Buddha, there are no bones. You are really mad! Ikkyu said: Then bring
the other two Buddhas also; the night is long and very cold.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the morning – of course he was thrown out in the night, out of
the temple, because he would burn the whole temple – in the morning when
the priest came out of the temple Ikkyu was sitting just near the
milestone on the road, and worshipping it.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest could not contain his curiosity. He asked: Now what are
you doing, madman? Ikkyu said: I am worshipping the Buddha and every day
in the morning that is my first thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the contradiction. But if you can SEE it is not a
contradiction at all, it is a simple fact. A fact, the deepest fact of
all mysticism.</p><p><br></p><p>STRIKE YOUR MASTER HARD AND WORSHIP IN FAITH. Love your Master so
deeply that there is no clinging – you can kill, you can drop, the other
disappears, the other is absorbed, only you in your crystal purity
remain. But this is possible only if total faith is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course this Ikkyu must have loved Buddha tremendously, otherwise
how is it possible to burn Buddha? How is it conceivable? He must have
loved so totally that there was NO PROBLEM. He could burn the wooden
Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha died. Mahakashyap, one of his greatest disciples, did not
utter a single word: as if nothing had happened. He remained sitting
under his tree. People were running here and there, there was much
turmoil – Buddha has said he is leaving today! But this Mahakashyap
never moved from his tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people said: Mahakashyap, what are you doing? This is the last
day! Buddha is leaving the body! It is said that he laughed and said:
But who told you that he ever had a body? I know him. He has never been
in the body. So what is the point of all this fuss? Let him leave it! He
has never been in it. It is said that Mahakashyap told his disciples
that Buddha was never born, never died, he never walked on the earth, he
never uttered a single word; and every day in the morning Mahakashyap
was worshipping the feet of Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Difficult to understand, because you can understand hate which
becomes destructive, you can understand love which becomes attachment,
you cannot understand total love which is both, which destroys the
non-essential and creates the essential.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED... Very beautiful.
But remember, to be unattached is not to renounce the world. If you
renounce the world you are attached to the world;</p><p>otherwise why should you renounce it? What is the point in renouncing
it if you are not attached to it? Only attachment renounces. If you are
really non-attached there is no question of any renunciation.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU WISH TO BE DEVOTED TO GOD, LIVE UNATTACHED, HOMELESS, IN SPITE
OF A</p><p>HOMESTEAD AND YOUR LIFE WITH A GIRL. Live in the house, be a
householder: with your woman, your children – but remain unattached;
because when you leave woman and children and house and you escape to
the forest, you simply show that you were too much attached to all these
things – otherwise why should you bother? And if you were attached how
can attachment disappear by just going to the forest? It may become even
greater because whenever things are not there you feel their need
more.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are hungry, you become food-obsessed. When you are on a fast
you think only of food and nothing else. When you try to escape from
your woman you will be sex-obsessed; you will think only of sex and
nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>If you wish to be devoted to God, if you really want to know the
truth – live unattached, but LIVE. Unattachment should be a way of life,
not a renunciation. Live unattached, but emphasis is on being in the
world – live!</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t try to commit a slow suicide – LIVE it through and through!
Live unattached, homeless, in spite of the home; live in the home but
homeless. Live with the family but as if alone. Move with the crowd but
never become part of the crowd. Be in the marketplace but never lose
your inner meditativeness.</p><p><br></p><p>DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT FOREVER MISLEADS. Why does the head
mislead forever? In fact the head is not yours, that’s why it misleads.
The head is a trick played by the society upon you. The head is like a
mechanism attached to you by the society, imposed on you by the
society.</p><p><br></p><p>You bring a heart with you, you don’t bring the head with you – it is
conditioned and trained by the society.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever thought that there is any possibility of a heart being
a Mohammedan or being a Christian or a Parsee or a Hindu? The heart is
simply the heart, but the head is a Hindu, head is Christian, head is a
Mohammedan. The heart is not Indian nor Chinese nor American, it is
simply human. But the head is Indian, Chinese, American...</p><p><br></p><p>The head belongs to the world, the heart belongs to you. The head is
trained by the world, it is the world put within you. That’s why it
misleads. It always says things which go against the innermost flow. It
goes on diverting your energies, diverting your energies according to
the society in which you have been brought up. The heart is natural, the
head is social. The head comes from the crowd, the heart comes from the
universe.</p><p><br></p><p>DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR HEAD THAT FOREVER MISLEADS. DO NOT ONLY THINK
BUT CHAIN YOUR MASTER HAND AND FOOT. CUT OUT A CANE OF LOVE AND FLOG HIM
UNTIL HE IS BLUE – but it is a cane of LOVE – AND FLOG HIM UNTIL HE IS
BLUE. THE MASTER MUST ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE...</p><p>Absurd sayings, but very beautiful. I have told you many times: it
happened that Buddha, in a past life, when he was not a Buddha, heard
about a man who had become enlightened. He went to see him. He touched
his feet. Then suddenly he was surprised because that enlightened man,
that Buddha, touched Buddha’s feet. Buddha said: What are you doing? I
am an unenlightened ignorant man, a sinner – and you, touching my feet?
I should touch your feet – that’s okay, but why are you touching my
feet?</p><p><br></p><p>That enlightened man started laughing and he said: You may not be
knowing it but you are also a Buddha. Sooner or later you will become a
Buddha. You may not be able to see it but I can see it. Once you have
become a Buddha you know the Buddhahood of the whole of existence. Then
you never meet anything which is not part of Buddhahood, enlightenment.
You look at a stone and you see a Buddha hidden there. In the greatest
sinner you see the fulfilment of the greatest sainthood. In the greatest
of evil you see the good sprouting. Once you are alert, aware,
enlightened, the quality of the whole existence changes for you.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER MUST ETERNALLY BOW AT THE FEET OF THE DISCIPLE...
Ordinarily the disciple</p><p>bows at the feet of the Master – but that is in the visible world
which can be seen by the eyes; in the invisible the Master is bowing at
the feet of the disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus was leaving his disciples, the last night, when he was
caught – and the next day he was murdered – he bowed down and touched
the feet of all his apostles; even the feet of Judas he washed and
kissed. And they were all surprised: This has never happened, what is he
doing? He is bowing down to the future Buddhas. Even a Judas some day or
other will become a Buddha, a Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>And time does not matter much. Time matters only to the mind, but to
a man who has gone beyond mind, time matters nothing. Somebody has
become enlightened today, somebody will become enlightened tomorrow,
somebody else the day after tomorrow – but it doesn’t matter to one who
has attained to a no-mindness. It is eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Jesus: Why are you touching our feet? What are you
doing? And Jesus is reported to have said: So that you remember that the
Master had touched the feet of the disciples; so that you don’t become
haughty so that you don’t become proud so that you don’t force people to
touch your feet so that you remember that finally the Master has to just
touch the feet of the disciple and has to bow down. Because in the
disciple also the morning is hidden.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be a dark night still, but the darker the night the brighter
the morning is going to be. It is just coming, it is just by the comer,
you cannot see but the Master can see and he bows down to you – to the
morning that is going to happen within you.</p><p><br></p><p>This Baul Panchuchand is really beautiful. Lao Tzu would have
accepted him as a friend. Question 3</p><p>WILL YOU COMMENT ON THE NATURE OF FEAR?</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is a negativity, an absence. This has to be understood very very
deeply. If you miss there you will never be able to understand the
nature of fear. It is like darkness. Darkness does not exist, it</p><p>only appears to be. In fact it is just an absence of light. Light
exists; remove the light – there is darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Darkness does not exist, you cannot remove darkness. Do whatsoever
you want to do, you cannot remove darkness. You cannot bring it, you
cannot throw it. If you have to do something with darkness, you will
have to do something with light, because only something which has an
existence can be related to. Put the light off, darkness is there; put
the light on, darkness is not there – but you do something with LIGHT.
You cannot do anything with darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear is darkness. It is absence of love. You cannot do anything about
it, and the more you do, the more you will become fearful because then
the more you will find it impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem will become more and more complicated. If you fight with
darkness you will be defeated. You can bring a sword and try to kill the
darkness: you will only be exhausted. And, finally, the mind will think:
Darkness is so powerful, that’s why I am defeated.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where logic goes wrong. It is absolutely logical that if you
have been struggling with darkness and you could not defeat it, could
not destroy it; it is absolutely logical to come then to the conclusion
that darkness is very very powerful.I am impotent before it. But the
reality is just the opposite. You are not impotent, darkness is
impotent. In fact darkness is not there – that’s why you could not
defeat it. How can you defeat something which is not?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t fight with the fear otherwise you will become more and more
afraid: and a new fear will enter into your being, that is: fear of
fear, which is very dangerous. In the first place fear is absence and in
the second place the fear of fear is the fear of the absence of absence.
Then you go into a madness.</p><p><br></p><p>You have taken a wrong step. Fear is nothing but absence of love. Do
something with love, forget about fear. If you love well, fear
disappears. If you love deeply, fear is not found.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you have been in love with someone, ever for a single
moment, was there any fear? It has never been found in any relationship
– if even for a single moment two persons are in deep love and a meeting
happens, they are tuned to each other, in that moment fear has never
been found. Just as if the light is on and darkness has not been found
There is the secret key: Love more.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel there is fear in your being – love more. Be courageous in
love, take courage. Be adventurous in love, love more, and love
unconditionally, because the more you love the less will be the
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I say LOVE I mean all the four layers of love: from sex to
samadhi. Love deeply.</p><p>If you love deeply in a sexual relationship much fear will disappear
from the body. If your body trembles in fear, it is the fear of sex; you
have not been in a deep sexual relationship. Your body trembles, your
body is not at ease, at home.</p><p><br></p><p>Love deeply – a sexual orgasm will dispel all fear out of the body.
When I say it will dispel all fear I don’t mean that you will become
brave because brave people are nothing but cowards upside down.</p><p>When I say all fear will disappear I mean there will be no cowardice
and no bravery. Those are two aspects of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at your brave people: you will find that deep inside they are
afraid, they have created just an armour around them. Bravery is not
fearlessness, it is fear well-protected, well-defended, armoured.</p><p><br></p><p>When fear disappears you become fearless. And a fearless person is
one who never creates fear in anybody, and who never allows anybody to
create fear in him.</p><p><br></p><p>Deep sexual orgasm gives body at-homeness. A very very deep health
happens in the body because the body feels whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the second step is love. Love people – unconditionally. If you
have some conditions in the mind then you will never be able to love –
those conditions will become barriers. Because love is beneficial to you
why bother about conditions? It is so beneficial, it is such a deep
well-being that – love unconditionally; don’t ask anything in return. If
you can come to understand that just by loving people you grow in
fearlessness, you will love! For the sheer joy of it!</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily people love only when their conditions are fulfilled. They
say: You should be like this – only then will I love. A mother says to
the child: I’ll love you only if you behave. A wife says to the husband:
You have to be THIS way, only then can I love you. Everybody creates
conditions; love disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is an infinite sky! You cannot force it into narrow spaces:
conditioned, limited.</p><p><br></p><p>If you bring fresh air into your house and close it from everywhere –
all the windows closed, all the doors closed – soon it becomes stale.
Whenever love happens it is a part of freedom; then soon you bring that
fresh air into your house – and everything goes stale, dirty.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a deep problem for the whole humanity. It has been a problem.
When you fall in love everything looks beautiful, because in those
moments you don’t put conditions. Two persons move near each other
unconditionally. Once they have settled, once they have started taking
each other for granted, then conditions are being imposed: You should be
like this, you should behave like that – only then will I love: as if
love is a bargain.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t love out of your fullness of heart, you are bargaining. You
want to force the other person to do something for you, only then will
you love. Otherwise you will betray your love. Now you are using your
love as a punishment, or as an enforcement. But you are not loving.
Either you are trying to withhold your love or you are giving your love
but in both cases love in itself is not the end; something else is.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are a husband then you bring ornaments to the wife – she is
happy, she dings to you, kisses you; but when you don’t bring anything
to the house there is a distance; she does not cling, she does not come
near to you.</p><p><br></p><p>When you do such things you are forgetting that when you love it is
beneficial to you, not only to others. In the first place love helps
those who love, in the second place it helps those who are being
loved.</p><p>And as I see it, people come to me, they always say: The other is not
loving me. Nobody comes and says: I am not loving the other. Love has
become a demand – the other is not loving me! Forget about the other!
Love is such a beautiful phenomenon, if you love you will enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more you love, the more you become loveable. The less you
love and the more you demand that others should love you, the less and
less you are loveable, the more and more you become closed, confined to
your ego. And you become touchy. Even if somebody approaches you to love
you, you become afraid, because in every love there is a possibility of
rejection, withdrawal.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody loves you – this has become an ingrained thought within you:
how is this man trying to change your mind? He is trying to love you? –
Must be something false; isn’t he trying to deceive you? Must be a
cunning man, tricky. You protect yourself. You don’t allow anybody to
love you and you don’t love others. Then there is fear. Then you are
alone in the world, so alone, so lonely, not connected.</p><p><br></p><p>What is fear then? Fear is a feeling of no contact with existence Let
this be the definition of fear: a state of no contact with existence is
fear. You are left alone, a child crying in the house, the mother and
father and the whole family gone to the theatre. The child cries and
weeps in his cradle. Left alone with no contact, nobody to protect,
nobody to give solace, nobody to love; a loneliness, a vast loneliness
all around. This is the state of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>This comes up because you are brought up in such a way that you don’t
allow love to happen. Whole of humanity has been trained for other
things, not for love.</p><p><br></p><p>To kill, we have been trained: and armies exist. Years of training to
kill! To calculate, we have been trained: colleges, universities exist.
Years of training just to calculate so that nobody can deceive you and
you can deceive others. But nowhere is there any opportunity available
where you are allowed to love – and love in freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, not only that, the society hinders every effort to love.
Parents don’t like their children to fall in love. No father likes it,
no mother likes it; whatsoever their pretensions no father, no mother
likes their children to fall in love. They like arranged marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Because once a young man falls in love with a woman or a girl,
he is moving away from the family, he is creating a new unit of family,
his own family.He is against the old family of course, he is rebellious,
he is saying: Now I am going away, I will create my own home. And he
chooses his own woman; the father has nothing to do with it, the mother
has nothing to do with it; they seem completely cut off.</p><p><br></p><p>No, they would like to arrange it: You create a home, but let us
arrange it. So we have some say in it. And don’t fall in love – because
when you fall in love the love becomes the whole world. If it is an
arranged marriage it is just a social affair, you are not in love, your
wife is not your whole world, your husband is not your whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>So wherever arranged marriage continues the family continues. And
wherever love-marriage has come into being the family is
disappearing.</p><p>In the West the family is disappearing. Now you can see the whole
logic of why there is arranged marriage: the family wants to exist. If
you are destroyed, if your very possibility of love is destroyed that is
not the point; you have to be sacrificed for the family. If a marriage
is arranged then a joint family exists. Then in a family a hundred
persons can live – if marriage is arranged.</p><p><br></p><p>But if some boy falls in love or some girl falls in love then they
become a world unto themselves. They want to move alone, they want their
privacy They don’t want a hundred persons around: uncles and uncles’
uncles and cousins’ cousins and... they don’t want this whole market
around; they would like to have their own private world. This whole
thing seems to be disturbing.</p><p><br></p><p>Family is against love. You must have heard that family is the source
of love, but I tell you family is against love. Family has existed by
killing love, it has not allowed love to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The society does not allow love because if a person is really in deep
love he cannot be manipulated. You cannot send him to war; he will say:
I am so happy! Where are you sending me? And why should I go and kill
strangers who may be happy in their home? And we have no conflict, no
clash of interests...</p><p><br></p><p>If the young generation. moves deeper and deeper in love, wars will
disappear because you will not be able to find enough mad people to go
to the war. If you love, you have tasted something of life; you would
not like death and killing people. When you don’t love you have not
tasted something of life; you love death.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear kills, wants to kill. Fear is destructive, love is a creative
energy. When you love you would like to create – you may like to sing a
song, or paint, or create poetry, but you would not take a bayonet, or
an atom bomb, and go rushing off madly to kill people who are absolutely
unknown to you, who have done nothing; who are as unknown to you as you
are unknown to them.</p><p><br></p><p>The world will drop wars only when love enters into the world again.
Politicians don’t want you to love, the society does not want you to
love, the family doesn’t allow you to love: they all want to control
your love energy because that is the only energy there is. That’s why
there is fear.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand me well drop all fears and love more and love
unconditionlly – and don’t think that you are doing something for the
other when you love, you are doing something for yourself. When you love
it is beneficial to you. So don’t wait; don’t say that when others love,
you will love – that is not the point at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Be selfish. Love is selfish. Love people – you will be fulfilled
through it, you will be getting more and more blessedness through
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And when love goes deeper fear disappears; love is the light, fear is
darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is the third stage of love – prayer. Churches,
religions, organized sects – they teach you to pray. But in fact they
hinder you from praying because prayer is a spontaneous phenomenon, it
cannot be taught. If you have been taught a prayer in your childhood you
have been debarred from a beautiful experience that may have happened.
Prayer is a spontaneous phenomenon.</p><p>I must tell you one story I love. Leo Tolstoy has written a small
story: In a certain part of old Russia there was a lake, and it became
famous because of three saints. The whole country became interested.
Thousands of people were going and journeying to the lake to see those
three saints.</p><p><br></p><p>The arch-priest of the country became afraid: What is happening? He
had not heard these ‘saints’ and they had not been certified by the
church; who has made them saints?</p><p><br></p><p>This Christianity has been doing one of the most fooish things; they
give certificates: This man is a saint. As if you can make a man a saint
by certifying him!</p><p><br></p><p>But the people were mad, and much news was coming that miracles were
happening, so the priest had to go and see what the matter was.</p><p><br></p><p>He went in a boat to the island where those three poor people lived;
they were simply poor people, but very happy – because there is only one
poverty, and that poverty is a heart which cannot love. They were poor,
but they were rich: the richest you could ever find; they were happy
sitting under a tree laughing, enjoying, delighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the priest they bowed down, and the priest said: What are you
doing here? There are rumours that you are great saints. Do you know how
to pray? – because seeing these three persons the priest could
immediately sense that they were completly uneducated; a little idiotic,
Lao Tzuan. Happy but foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>So they looked at each other and they said: Sorry sir, we don’t know
the right prayer authorized by the church because we are ignorant. But
we have created one prayer of our own – it is homemade. If you won’t
feel offended we can show it to you.</p><p><br></p><p>So the priest said: Yes, show it to me, what prayer you are doing. So
they said: We tried and thought and thought – but we are not great
thinkers, we are foolish people, ignorant villagers; then we decided
upon a simple prayer. In Christianity God is thought of as a trinity,
three: God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. And we are also
three. So we decided on a prayer: You are three, we are three, have
mercy upon us. This is our prayer. We are three, you are also three,
have mercy on us.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest was very very angry, almost enraged. He said: What
nonsense! We have never heard any prayer like this. Stop it! This way
you cannot be saints. You are simply stupid. They fell at his feet and
they said: You teach us the real, the authentic prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>So he told them the authorized version of the prayer of the Russian
Church. It was long, complicated; big words, bombastic, those three
persons looked at each other – it seemed impossible, the door of heaven
was closed for them.</p><p><br></p><p>They said: You please tell us once more, because it is long, and we
are uneducated. He said it again. They said: Once more sir, because we
will forget, and something will go wrong. So again he told it. They
thanked him heartily and he felt very good that he had done a good deed:
brought three foolish people back to the church.</p><p>He sailed off in his boat – just in the middle of the lake he could
not believe his eyes: those three persons, those foolish people, were
coming running on the water. They said: Wait! Once more! We have
forgotten! Now this was impossible to believe!</p><p><br></p><p>The priest fell at their feet and he said: Forgive me. You continue
your Prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>The third love energy is prayer. Religions, organized churches, have
destroyed it. They have given you readymade prayers. Prayer is a
spontaneous feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this story when you pray. Let your prayer be a spontaneous
phenomenon. If even your prayer cannot be spontaneous, then what will
be? If even with God you have to be readymade then where will you be
authentic and true and natural?</p><p><br></p><p>Say things that you would like to say. Talk to him as you would talk
to a wise friend. But don’t bring formalities in. A formal relationship
is not a relationship at all. And you have become formal with God also.
You miss all spontaneousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Bring love into prayer. Then you can talk! It is a beautiful thing –
a dialogue with the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>But have you watched? If you are really spontaneous, people will
think you arc mad. If you go to a tree and start talking, or to a
flower, a rose, people will think you are mad. If you go to the church
and talk to the cross or to the image, nobody will think you are mad,
they will think you are religious. You are talking to a stone in the
temple and everybody thinks you are religious because this is the
authorized form.</p><p><br></p><p>If you talk to a rose – which is more alive than any stone image,
which is more divine than any stone image; if you talk to a tree – which
is more deeply rooted in God than any cross, because no cross has roots,
it is a dead thing that’s why it kills; a tree is alive, with roots deep
into the earth, branches high into the sky, connected with the whole,
with the rays of the sun, with the stars – talk to the trees! That can
be a contact point with the divine, but if you talk that way people will
think you are mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Spontaneousness is thought to be madness. Formalities are thought to
be sanity. Just the opposite is the reality. When you go into a temple
and you simply repeat some crammed prayer you are simply foolish. Have a
heart-to-heart talk! And prayer is beautiful. You will start flowering
through it. Prayer is to be in love – to be in love with the whole. And
sometimes you get angry with the whole and you don’t talk; that?s
beautiful. And you say: I will not talk, enough is enough, and you have
not been listening to me! A beautiful gesture. Not dead. And sometimes
you drop praying completely, because you go on praying and God is not
listening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a relationship with deep involvement in it. You get angry.
Sometimes you feel very good, feel thankful, grateful; sometimes you
feel put off; but let it be a LIVING relationship; then prayer is
true.</p><p><br></p><p>If you just go on like a gramophone and repeat the same thing every
day, you are not doing any prayer, it is not prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about an advocate who was a very calculating man. Every
night he would go to bed, look at the sky and say: Ditto. Just like the
other days. And go to sleep. Only once he prayed – the</p><p>first time in his life – and then: Ditto. It was like a legal thing;
what was the point in saying the same prayer again?</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you say ditto or you repeat the whole thing it is the same.
Prayer should be a lived experience, a heart-to-heart dialogue. And
soon, if it is hearty, you will feel that not only are you talking, but
the response is there. Then prayer has come into its own, come of age.
When you feel the response, that not only you are talking – if it is a
monologue it is still not prayer – it becomes a dialogue, you not only
speak, you listen.</p><p><br></p><p>And I tell you the whole existence is ready to respond. Once your
heart is open the whole responds.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing like prayer. No love can be as beautiful as prayer.
Just as no sex can be as beautiful as love no love can be as beautiful
as prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>But then there is the fourth stage which I call meditation. There
dialogue also ceases. Then you have a dialogue in silence. Words drop,
because when the heart is really full you cannot speak. When the heart
is too overflowing only silence can be the medium. Then there is no
other. You are one with the universe. You neither say anything nor
listen to anything. You ARE with the one, with the universe, with the
whole. A oneness. This is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the four stages of love, and on each stage there will be a
disappearance of fear. If sex happens beautifully the body fear will
disappear. The body will not be neurotic. Ordinarily – I have observed
thousands of bodies – they are neurotic. Bodies gone mad. Not fulfilled.
Not at home.</p><p><br></p><p>If love happens, fear will disappear from the mind. You will have a
life of freedom, at ease, at- homeness. No fear will come, no
nightmares.</p><p><br></p><p>If the prayer happens then fear completely disappears, because with
prayer you become one – you start feeling a deep relationship with the
whole. From the spirit, fear disappears; the fear of death disappears
when you pray – never before it.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you meditate even fearlessness disappears. Fear disappears,
fearlessness disappears. Nothing remains. Or. only the nothing remains.
A vast purity; virginity; innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>IF I AM TO BE MY BROTHER’S KEEPER, HOW FAR DOES MY RESPONSIBILITY
GO?</p><p><br></p><p>No, you are not. Nobody is. Nobody is meant to be anybody’s keeper.
You are here to be yourself. Your only responsibility is towards
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to be totally selfish because only in that is there
a possibility that you may be helpful to others. Unless you are deeply
self-centred, unless you are so selfish in your being that you are
happy, celebrating, you will not be able to share it.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity has been put on the wrong track by altruists, by people who
say: Serve others, you are responsible for others. Nobody is responsible
for anybody. The only responsibility is towards yourself. And if you are
fulfilled in that responsibility you respond beautifully.</p><p>A really fulfilled husband will love his wife, because out of his
fulfilment love flows. But if he thinks he has to fulfil
responsibilities, he has a duty to care because he has got married to
this woman, then he will be killing his woman, poisoning the woman,
because this very attitude is poisonous. He will be dragging the weight,
and with his every gesture he will be showing that he is not satisfied.
With every gesture he will go on hinting to the woman: You are a heavy
weight on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Your mother is old; if you have really a deeprooted centring within
you you will love and serve her – not because this is your
responsibility, no, but because this is how it happens to be. You enjoy
serving the old woman. You love it! It is simple. You are not being a
martyr, you are not trying to sacrifice yourself – remember always
whenever you are a martyr you can never forgive the person for whom you
have been a martyr. You will carry the wound, and you would like to take
revenge. But the whole world has been trained: the father has to fulfil
his duties to the children, then those children never forget and never
forgive the father.</p><p><br></p><p>Now one of the greatest insights that has come to Western psychology
is that children never forgive their parents. This seems to be
ridiculous because parents have been doing so much; but the very idea
that ‘I am doing so much’ is a crippling thing, heavy. The father goes
on saying: I am sacrificing for you. This is simply stupid. Nobody is
sacrificing for anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love the children – you work, if you don’t love – you don’t
work. It is better that the children should die than they should live a
burdened life. If you love your wife – you love, and there is no
question of any responsibility. If you don’t love, be frank and be true.
Don’t love her. Somebody else may love her, why waste her life and your
life?</p><p><br></p><p>Now in the West out of four marriages one marriage is absolutely
broken in divorce. That means twenty-five per cent of marriages break up
in divorce. Now psychoanalysts have been trying to do some research:
what happens to the other three? They have come to feel that out of
four, one breaks up in divorce, and out of four, two are unlived
marriages: living together yet not together. Out of four, one breaks,
two are continued; divorce is not given but the situation is of divorce
– they live in divorce, not separate, not together. Only one they
suspect is a marriage, only one out of four – and that too is SUSPECTED
only, certainty is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Why is this happening? The basic point has been missed. The basic
point is a man can love others only when he loves himself. A man can
share his feelings with others only when he has something to SHARE.</p><p><br></p><p>First be selfish, only then can you be unselfish. Be rooted and
centred in your being, so overflowing that out of your overflowingness
you share. Not that you are a martyr. Never become a sacrifice,
otherwise you will never be able to forgive those people who forced you
to become a sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>No, nobody is anybody’s keeper. The only responsibility is towards
yourself. This will look as if I am teaching selfishness. Yes, I am
teaching it. If everybody in the world was selfish the world would be
beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Just think – everybody trying to be
happy, everybody trying to be celebrating, everybody trying to be
silent, meditative, prayerful, loving – because these are the things
which will make you happy; the world will be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>But here, nobody is trying to be happy himself. People are trying to
make others happy. And if you are not happy how can you make others
happy? You make them more unhappy. Public servants</p><p>who are trying to change others’ lives so that they can become happy,
are the most mischievous people in the world. Who are you to make
anybody happy? If they want to be unhappy please let them be unhappy. At
least that is their right! To be happy or unhappy is one’s right. You
keep to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You become unhappy if you want, you become happy if you want. Nobody
wants to be unhappy and nobody will be unhappy if he looks to his own
affairs, pays attention to his own affairs. A world absolutely selfish
will be the best world possible.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am against communism and all socialistic tendencies.
Because they kill the individual. They sacrifice the individual for the
society, for the state. They say: For the country you have to die. For
the religion you have to die. For the good of all you have to die – and
they go on saying this to everybody, and everybody is dying – and for
nobody!</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody is unhappy trying to make everybody else happy. It is
not possible – you cannot make anybody happy. In fact you cannot make
anybody unhappy either. The most that can be done, that which is humanly
possible, is to be happy or unhappy. Decide that. That’s all. And out of
that, beautiful things start happening.</p><p><br></p><p>When your house is lighted, when you have a fragrance of happiness,
suddenly your fragrance enters into others’ lives, changes them,
transforms them, without any mind on your part to transform them.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>DO WE HAVE MISSIONS TO FULFIL?</p><p><br></p><p>No, nobody has any mission to fulfil. Missionaries are dangerous
people. They have done enough harm. You have to fulfil yourself. No
mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Let God take care of others. You just fulfil your own being. Don’t
try to convert anybody. Don’t try to be a do-gooder, and don’t think
that you have a mission and everybody else has to follow it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how the whole world has been suffering for so many centuries.
So many missionaries creating so much conflict; pushing and pulling
people from here and there. Leave them in peace!</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has any mission to fulfil – but ego always wants such things:
that you have a mission to fulfil. People come to me and they say: Why
has God given birth to me? Very important people. God has given special
work to them. And I ask them: Just go and ask the trees and the dogs and
the cats: they must also be asking – WHY has God given birth to us?
Mi]lions and millions of animals are there with no mission.</p><p><br></p><p>In your body there are millions of germs – with no mission. If you
put twenty-seven zeros on the figure five – that is the calculation of
living cells in your body; and they are completely oblivious of you –
that you exist. They live their own life, they move in the bloodstream,
they enjoy, they love, they fall in love, they get married, they give
birth to children, they fulfil their duties – they must be thinking they
have some mission to fulfil</p><p>What are you in this vast universe? Not even a small cell.</p><p><br></p><p>But man is very egoistic. He cannot feel at ease just to be himself,
he wants some great mission to be attached to his ego. No, I don’t see
any mission. The whole may have something but no individual has.</p><p><br></p><p>So the only thing you can do is to be yourself, blissfully yourself,
and through that blissfulness you fulfil something. But it is not that
you fulfil it, it is fulfilled through you; you become a vehicle to the
whole. But it is not a mission. You should not look at it and you should
not bother about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Be ordinary. Just the effort to be extraordinary is a sort of
madness. Just be ordinary and you are divine. Try to become
extraordinary and you are mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU BELIEVE MANKIND WILL SOME DAY EVOLVE INTO A HIGHER PLANE – A
WORLD FREE FROM WAR, INJUSTICE, ETC.?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think of the morrow at all, of what will happen tomorrow.
People who will be here tomorrow – they will think about it. This moment
is enough for me. And this is the only moment we can live, you cannot
live in the future. Don’t waste your time on it.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be worried about mankind: you will never meet anywhere any
mankind or humanity; all that you will meet will be human beings.
Humanity is an abstraction; non-existential; just a word. Don’t be
bothered about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have a small life span; you will be living with human beings;
just see how you can live so you can be fulfilled. Whether in the future
there will be wars or not, who are we to decide? And why should we
bother?</p><p><br></p><p>But there are utopians who go on thinking about the future. They miss
their lives in thinking about the future. And that future never comes.
The word utopia means: that which never comes.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on thinking about it: a world without wars, without famine,
without poverty, but what is the point? – you are dreaming! Rather, be
more realistic. Create a human being inside you who has no warring
tendencies, no conflicting tendencies, no violence, no aggression;
that’s all that can be done. That is feasible.</p><p><br></p><p>Create a human being within, don’t think about human kind. How can
you manage that? That is not possible. Leave all that to foolish
politicians. They will think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do something for the human being that you are. Drop all
conflicting tendencies: violence, aggression, fear – be loving,
prayerful, meditative. Create at least one human being as you would like
the whole humanity to be. At least create a model within you so that
your fragrance spreads and gives a vision to people that this too is
possible, that man IS divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Love more. Delight more, celebrate more, dance more, sing more:
that’s all that you can do. Leave a dream around you – actualized. If
somebody loves it, he may follow. I cannot say that the whole humanity
will follow – it is such a vast thing.</p><p>And there is no need of that because your happiness may not be
others’ happiness. Your singing may be just noise for somebody else.
Your dance may be nothing but a nuisance. So who is to decide? Don’t
take the responsibility that you will decide for the whole – no.</p><p><br></p><p>You drop out of these roles of decider. You are not the decider. You
simply live your life in the small corner that you have got. Whatsoever
you can do for yourself, DO IT. And if somebody feels good, attracted,
magnetized – help him, but out of love, not out of any missionary
spirit. That is poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>‘IF YOU MEET A BUDDHA ON THE ROAD, KILL HIM IMMEDIATELY!’ – WHAT
ABOUT YOU? HOW DO I BOTH LOVE YOU AND KILL YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Do the same to me. First try to find me and then when you have found
me – kill me immediately. Because that’s how you will attain to your own
perfection.</p><p>Even if I am there the duality will remain. An object in the mind is
a disturbance. Drop that object also. When you have killed me you have
completely followed me. When I have disappeared only then will you be
grateful to me. Only then will you understand that the work of the
Master is very contradictory.</p><p><br></p><p>First he has to create a situation in which you fall in love with
him. He has to create a situation in which you start allowing him to
guide you. This is the first part. When it starts functioning he has to
create a situation in which you have to drop him.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like a ladder: you go on the ladder – first you have to
move on the ladder, cling to the ladder, and then you have to leave the
ladder. If you go on clinging to the ladder then the whole point is
missed.</p><p><br></p><p>The ladder is not the goal. You only want it to reach some other
plane of being. The ladder helped from one plane to another, but if you
cling to the ladder, at the last moment you say: I cannot leave this
ladder because it has helped me so much, and I am so grateful, how can I
leave it? Then the whole point is missed.</p><p><br></p><p>The ladder is not the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to say that once it happened: Five idiots were
travelling. They came to a big river. They purchased a small boat. They
crossed the river. Then they thought: This boat is wonderful. It has
helped us to come across the river, otherwise it would not have been
possible for us to cross it. So we should be grateful to it.</p><p><br></p><p>So they carried the boat on their heads into the marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>People enquired: What is the matter? Why are you carrying this boat?
They said: We are very grateful. This boat helped us to cross the river
otherwise we would still have been on the other shore. Now we can never
leave it!</p><p>Buddha said: Always remember that the Master is a boat. Cross the
river, but don’t carry the boat on the head otherwise one who was going
to free you will become your bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how when a boat is carried, the boat of Christ is carried, you
become a Christian, not a Christ. If you drop the boat you become a
Christ; if you carry the boat you become a Christian. If you drop the
boat of Buddha you become a Buddha yourself; if you carry the boat you
become a Buddhist. Which is foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be one of those five idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>Love me only to drop me one day. And love me so deeply that you can
drop without any grudge without any clinging without any complaint.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks difficult because you can understand love only in terms of
attachment. You don’t know that love is deep unattachment. You can
understand love only as possessiveness. You don’t know that love is the
greatest freedom, non-possessiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>If you allow me to create the situation and you don’t create
resistance, first you will start clinging to me – that’s how the journey
starts, one has to enter the boat. But when the other shore is reached I
will be the first to tell you to leave the boat completely and forget
about it. The purpose is fulfilled. You move ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>The last step has to be taken in the divine, in God, and the Master
has to be dropped. The Master is naught but a door.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

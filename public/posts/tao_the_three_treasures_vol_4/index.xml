‌CHAPTER 1
Never be the First in the World
23 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
LAO TZU SAYS:
ALL THE WORLD SAYS:
MY TEACHING, TAO, GREATLY RESEMBLES FOLLY. BECAUSE IT IS GREAT, THEREFORE IT RESEMBLES FOLLY. IF IT DID NOT RESEMBLE FOLLY, IT WOULD HAVE LONG AGO BECOME PETTY INDEED!
I HAVE THREE TREASURES; GUARD THEM AND KEEP THEM SAFE. THE FIRST IS LOVE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Bring the other two Buddhas also!
24 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE INSIDE WITH YOU?
Whenever you are with yourself you ARE with me, and there is no other way to be with me. So don’t create a duality between you and me. Just try to be with yourself, just try to be your withinness, and you are with me!</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
They know me not
25 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
LAO TZU SAYS:
MY TEACHINGS ARE VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND VERY EASY TO PRACTISE, BUT NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THEM AND NO ONE CAN PRACTISE THEM. IN MY WORDS THERE IS A PRINCIPLE. IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN THERE IS A SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOT THESE, THEY ALSO KNOW ME NOT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
What Type of Heaven is This?
26 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT IS IT INSIDE PEOPLE THAT MAKES THEM REACT TO WHAT YOU SAY AND WHAT YOU ARE WITH SUCH ANTAGONISM? WHY CAN’T PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU JUST LIVE THEIR OWN LIVES THE WAY THEY FEEL, AND LEAVE YOU TO YOURSELF?
The responsibility is not with the people, the responsibility is with me.</description>

      <title>5 Sickmindedness</title>

‌CHAPTER 5
Sickmindedness
27 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
LAO TZU SAYS:
WHO KNOWS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS THE HIGHEST; WHO PRETENDS TO KNOW WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS SICKMINDED. AND WHO RECOGNIZES SICKMINDEDNESS AS SICKMINDEDNESS, IS NOT SICKMINDED. THE SAGE IS NOT SICKMINDED. BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES SICKMINDEDNESS AS SICKMINDEDNESS, THEREFORE HE IS NOT SICKMINDED.
Man is like an onion, exactly like an onion; layers and layers of personality; and behind all those layers is hidden the essence.</description>

      <title>6 This is the Whole World I Have</title>

‌CHAPTER 6
This is the Whole World I Have
28 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT?
It is impossible, absolutely impossible to have an original thought. Because mind is memory, mind is the past, mind is that which you have already known, it is a borrowed thing, and whatsoever the mind can do can only be a repetition; new combinations of words, notions, concepts; but deep down all will be borrowed.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Hard and Soft
29 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
LAO TZU SAYS:
WHEN MAN IS BORN, HE IS TENDER AND WEAK; AT DEATH, HE IS HARD AND STIFF. WHEN THINGS AND PLANTS ARE ALIVE, THEY ARE SOFT AND SUPPLE; WHEN THEY ARE DEAD, THEY ARE BRITTLE AND DRY. THEREFORE HARDNESS AND STIFFNESS ARE THE COMPANIONS OF DEATH, AND SOFTNESS AND GENTLENESS ARE THE COMPANIONS OF LIFE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
It is Just a Joke
30 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
YOU TELL US AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT TO DESIRE ENLIGHTENMENT AND YET YOU ALSO REMIND US AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW IMPOVERISHED AND WHAT RUBBISH OUR LIVES ARE, AND TELL US HOW BLISSFUL AND RICH ENLIGHTENMENT IS. HOW CAN ONE AVOID PREFERRING BLISS TO RUBBISH?
Preference is the greatest problem.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Nothing Weaker Than Water
31 August 1975 am in Buddha Hall
LAO TZU SAYS:
THERE IS NOTHING WEAKER THAN WATER BUT NONE IS SUPERIOR TO IT IN OVERCOMING THE HARD, FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE. THAT WEAKNESS OVERCOMES STRENGTH AND GENTLENESS OVERCOMES RIGIDITY, NO ONE DOES NOT KNOW; NO ONE CAN PUT INTO PRACTICE.
THEREFORE THE SAGE SAYS: WHO RECEIVES UNTO HIMSELF THE CALUMNY OF THE WORLD IS THE PRESERVER OF THE STATE.</description>

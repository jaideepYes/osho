The reality is, but indefinable. It IS; it is felt. We are part of it; we encounter it everywhere. Wheresoever you move, you move in reality; you live every moment in it; you participate in it every moment. It is not something different from you, you are not something different from it, but still you cannot name it, you cannot pinpoint it, you cannot give it a label. What is it?\nThis is a problem for a religious mind. It is not a problem for a philosophical mind; the philosopher can say it is existence, naked, pure – it is absolute. For a Heidegger it is not a problem; he can call it simple “is-ness,” being. For a shankara it is not a problem; he can call it the supreme, the absolute, the brahman. But these are not basically religious types.\nFor a religious person it becomes a problem, because unless he can name it he cannot be related to it; unless he can personify it he cannot feel the relatedness. The intimacy is impossible with a pure\n“is-ness.” An intimate relationship is not possible with something absolute, with something just like a concept. Being, brahman – how can you feel related with being, with brahman, with “is-ness,” with existence? Relationship is only possible when you personify it. That is the basic difference between philosophical speculation and religious search.\nReligion is in search of an intimate relationship with existence; it is not only speculation. For a religious man it is going to be life itself. Philosophy seeks in terms of knowledge, religion in terms of love. When you are seeking in terms of knowledge, you can be an observer, an onlooker. But you are not a participant, you are not deep in it – you are just an outsider. A philosopher is basically an outsider; he goes on thinking, but from without. He will not enter into a deep relationship. He will not get involved, he will not be committed. But religion is nothing if it is not a commitment; religion is nothing if it is not an intimate love relationship. So how to change existence into a love object? This sutra is concerned with this.\nThis sutra says that he is nameless, but we cannot deal with a nameless. He is nameless, obviously, but we must give a name to it; otherwise, we cannot feel related. And to feel related is a great transformation. Not only is the divine nameless, everything is nameless. A child is born a nameless phenomenon, with no name – but if you don’t give a name to him, he will be unable even to live. If no name is given to him it will be impossible for him to move. Not only that, but others will not be able to understand him; he himself will not be able to understand himself. Even to understand oneself, one has to be addressed, given a name; otherwise, one cannot even think about oneself – who he is. Of course this name is just a false label, but it helps.\nThis is one of the mysteries of life: even falsities help, even untruths help, even dreams help, even illusions help. So a person who is bent upon destroying every illusion, every falsity, every untruth, may prove harmful. One has to remember: something may be false, but don’t destroy it. Let it be there, it has a utility. But the utility should not become the truth. Utility must remain a utility, it must not become the truth.\nMan cannot feel in deep relationship with the divine, with existence, unless he names it. Many names are possible – it will depend on the man who is naming. Thousands and thousands of names have been given to him. In India we have a book, VISHNU SAHASTRANAM – a thousand names of Vishnu. The whole book consists only of names – nothing else, just names. It is a very beautiful book, consisting only of names, but in its own way showing that the phenomenon is nameless. Only because of that, thousands of names are possible.\nSo you can name the divine any way. Call him whatsoever you like, but call him. The emphasis should be on the CALL, not on the name. Call him Rama, call him Hari, call him Krishna, call him Christ; call him any name – but call! Let there be a deep invocation. Use any name. That name is just artificial, but it will help.\nMake any image, but make it. The making is significant. Any image will do, but remember that this is just an artificial help; a technical use must be made of it. In this way also, India has tried many, many experiments – particularly Hindus. They make their idols of mud. Stone came only later on, with Buddhists and Jains; otherwise, Hindus were satisfied with mud images. Stone is a more substantial thing, more permanent; it give a permanency to a thing. A mud idol is just as impermanent as anything in the world. Hindus tried to make their idols only of mud, so that they\nremembered: this is just an artificial phenomenon made by us. And they insisted that it must be dissolved soon after.\nA Ganesha is made, worshiped, everything done – called, prayed, invoked – and then they go and throw it into the sea. This is very symbolic. This means: this image was just an artificial thing. We created it, we used it; now the use is over and we throw it. Hindus are the least idol-worshipers in the world, but everywhere they are known as the idol-worshipers. They are the least, because they are so courageous to throw away their idols so easily, and with such a celebration. They go to throw their idols into the sea with such a celebration. The throwing is as necessary as the creating.\nWith the stone idols things changed. No stone idol should be there. Clay idols are beautiful, because even if you are not going to destroy them, they will destroy themselves. Sooner or later you will become aware that this was just something made for a particular purpose. The purpose is solved, now the artificial help can be dissolved with a thankfulness, with a celebration. No country, no religion, no race, has been so courageous with its idols. Really, sometimes strange things happen.\nHindus are the least idol worshipers, and Mohammedans the most – and they have not worshiped at all. They have not made any idol. Not even a picture of Mohammed is available – not even a picture. How did he look? They have persistently denied any picture, any idol, any image. Not only have they denied them for themselves, they have destroyed others’ also. Others’ images, others’ idols they have destroyed – with a very good wish. Nothing is wrong in it, because they feel idol worship is harmful – harmful to a religious man. It must not be in between; god must be faced directly, immediately. There should be nothing in between – a very good wish, but it proved dangerous!\nIt proved dangerous; they went on destroying; they destroyed much that was beautiful – much. They destroyed Buddhist monasteries, Hindu temples, Hindu idols, Buddha’s images – they destroyed. All over Asia they destroyed, with a very good wish that nothing should remain between man and God. But they became too concerned with idols. Idol-destroying became their sole religious practice.\nThis is worship in a negative way – too much concentration on idols; idols became too significant for them. This is how life is strange. I call Hindus the least idol-worshipers, because they can throw away their idols any time the purpose is solved. They use them, but the idols can never use the Hindus; Hindus can use the idols. Mohammedans are so against, yet so concerned; so against but still so attached. They turn really into negative idol-worshipers. Create an image, create any name, create anything that you feel can help you move towards the divine. All names belong to him.\nOld Mohammedan names – old, and still Mohammedans are orthodox and old.… All old Mohammedan names are names of Allah. All old Hindu names – but now all names are not old – are names of Rama. Not only have we tried to give God a thousand names, we have tried to give everyone a name which really belongs to God. This is symbolic. Every name is God’s name, and every name – to whomsoever it belongs – indicates a god.\nThis sutra says:\nHE IS BRAHMA, HE IS SHIVA, HE IS INDRA. HE IS INDESTRUCTIBLE, THE SUPREME, THE SELF-LUMINOUS.\nHE ALONE IS VISHNU, HE IS PRANA. HE IS SUN, FIRE; HE IS THE MOON.\nHe is everything. Call him moon, call him sun, call him Vishnu – call him anything. Whatsoever you call him, remember that the call – the heartfelt call, the prayerful mood – is important. The name is just a device to help you to call him.\nHE ALONE IS ALL THAT WAS AND ALL THAT WILL BE, THE ETERNAL. KNOWING HIM ONE GOES BEYOND THE STING OF DEATH;\nKnowing him one goes beyond the sting of life and death – why? This has to be understood. Why, if you can understand him, why will you go beyond life and death? – because life and death belong to the ego. If you say he is everything that was, if you say he is everything that is, if you say he is everything that ever will be, that means you are not. That means he is and you are not; that means the ego is not – and only the ego is born and only the ego is to die. If he is everything, then he is birth, he is death, he is life. Then how can you conceive of yourself as being born, and as dying?\nBirth and death are just two poles of your ego – the feeling that “I am.” If you drop this feeling, then birth is not the beginning and death is not the end. Then something always was, before you were born. Really, you are a continuity, a continuity of the whole past; and when you die, nothing is dying – only the continuity changes, takes a turn. Around the corner the continuity will continue. But if you begin to feel between birth and death that you are, then you will die, then you will have to feel the suffering of dying.\nRemember that you are a continuity. The whole universe is involved in you; you are not alone. No man is an island, no man is alone and separate. The world exists as a net, as an interconnection, as inter-relatedness. The whole world exists as ONE. You are organic to it; you belong to it.\nIf this feeling comes to you. KNOWING HIM ONE GOES BEYOND THE STING OF life and DEATH; THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH COMPLETE FREEDOM. And unless you are a non-ego, there is no way to attain complete freedom. Ego is the slavery, ego is the suffering, ego is the anguish. Ego is the anxiety, the tension, the disease. So unless there is egolessness... and egolessness and God-consciousness mean the same thing. If you become God-conscious, you will become I-unconscious. If you are I-conscious, then you cannot be God-conscious. This is focusing. If you are focused on the ego, the whole universe goes into darkness. If you are focused on the whole universe, the “I” simply disappears. “I” is a focusing of all the energy on a limited link of an unlimited continuity – one link. One link of the whole chain is the ego. Remember the whole continuity.\nIt will be good if we can think in this way. Could I exist if something had been different in the universe? – I could not exist. Even a millennium before, if something had been different from what it was, I would not be here, because the whole universe is a continuity. Whatsoever I am saying... if a Buddha had not been there in the past, or a Jesus had not been there in the past, I couldn’t say this. The whole universe is a continuity. A single event missed in the past would make the whole universe different. And when I say a Buddha, you can understand. But I say, even if a single tree had not been there in the universe, I would not be here.\nThe whole universe exists as a continuity; it is an intermittent phenomenon. We are here because the universe was such that we could be here. The whole past was such that this meeting becomes\npossible. Something missing, and the whole thing will change. This feeling of eternal continuity in the past, of eternal continuity in the future, will dissolve the ego completely. You are not; you are just a part – a part which cannot exist alone.\nThen the destiny of the whole universe becomes your destiny, then you have no separate individual destiny. That is what is meant by saying one goes beyond life and death. If you have no individual destiny, the whole destiny of the universe IS your destiny. Then who is going to die? And who is going to be born? And who is concerned? Then a total acceptance explodes, a total acceptance comes. A TATHATA, a total acceptance happens. This is freedom; this is ultimate freedom. Now you cannot feel any limitation.\nThe universe has never felt limitation. You feel it because you separate yourself. I will die as an individual, but I cannot die as a universe. The atoms in my hand will be there; my eyes will be there as someone else’s eyes; my heart will be there as someone else’s heart. I will exist in the trees, in the stones, in the earth, in the sky – I will be there as a universe. I will not be there as myself. My consciousness will be there as someone else’s consciousness. Or even it may not be someone else’s consciousness... just a cloud floating in the sky, or just a silence, or just a drop in the ocean. As myself I am going to die, but not as a universe.\nThis remembrance, this realization is the only freedom – the only and the ultimate. Unless this happens, you are a slave. You will go on feeling limitations, you will go on feeling boundaries, you will go on feeling that this is going to be death, this is going to be birth, this is going to be pain, this is going to be suffering. To create, or to go on believing in individual destiny, is irreligion. The beginning of the feeling that “I am not an individual destiny – destiny belongs to the universe, I belong to the universe” – is the beginning of freedom, is the beginning of religion.\nReligion is the search for total freedom. And unless the freedom is total, it is not freedom at all.\nEXPERIENCING ONE’S OWN SELF IN ALL BEINGS AND ALL BEINGS IN THE SELF, ONE ATTAINS THE HIGHEST BRAHMAN, AND NOT BY ANY OTHER MEANS.\nThis is what I mean by being aware of a universal destiny: by dissolving one’s individual, petty destiny one begins to feel then that he is everything – all. All penetrates into oneself, and one’s own existence penetrates all. Really, it is saying simply that boundaries dissolve.\nThe observer becomes the observed. The knower becomes the known.\nThe lover becomes the beloved.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2721","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/>That Art Thou</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">25 Kaivalya Upanishad</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2721 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/That_Art_Thou/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

will do, but remember that this is just an artificial help; a technical
use must be made of it. In this way also, India has tried many, many
experiments – particularly Hindus. They make their idols of mud. Stone
came only later on, with Buddhists and Jains; otherwise, Hindus were
satisfied with mud images. Stone is a more substantial thing, more
permanent; it give a permanency to a thing. A mud idol is just as
impermanent as anything in the world. Hindus tried to make their idols
only of mud, so that they</p><p><br></p><p>remembered: this is just an artificial phenomenon made by us. And
they insisted that it must be dissolved soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>A Ganesha is made, worshiped, everything done – called, prayed,
invoked – and then they go and throw it into the sea. This is very
symbolic. This means: this image was just an artificial thing. We
created it, we used it; now the use is over and we throw it. Hindus are
the least idol-worshipers in the world, but everywhere they are known as
the idol-worshipers. They are the least, because they are so courageous
to throw away their idols so easily, and with such a celebration. They
go to throw their idols into the sea with such a celebration. The
throwing is as necessary as the creating.</p><p><br></p><p>With the stone idols things changed. No stone idol should be there.
Clay idols are beautiful, because even if you are not going to destroy
them, they will destroy themselves. Sooner or later you will become
aware that this was just something made for a particular purpose. The
purpose is solved, now the artificial help can be dissolved with a
thankfulness, with a celebration. No country, no religion, no race, has
been so courageous with its idols. Really, sometimes strange things
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus are the least idol worshipers, and Mohammedans the most – and
they have not worshiped at all. They have not made any idol. Not even a
picture of Mohammed is available – not even a picture. How did he look?
They have persistently denied any picture, any idol, any image. Not only
have they denied them for themselves, they have destroyed others’ also.
Others’ images, others’ idols they have destroyed – with a very good
wish. Nothing is wrong in it, because they feel idol worship is harmful
– harmful to a religious man. It must not be in between; god must be
faced directly, immediately. There should be nothing in between – a very
good wish, but it proved dangerous!</p><p><br></p><p>It proved dangerous; they went on destroying; they destroyed much
that was beautiful – much. They destroyed Buddhist monasteries, Hindu
temples, Hindu idols, Buddha’s images – they destroyed. All over Asia
they destroyed, with a very good wish that nothing should remain between
man and God. But they became too concerned with idols. Idol-destroying
became their sole religious practice.</p><p><br></p><p>This is worship in a negative way – too much concentration on idols;
idols became too significant for them. This is how life is strange. I
call Hindus the least idol-worshipers, because they can throw away their
idols any time the purpose is solved. They use them, but the idols can
never use the Hindus; Hindus can use the idols. Mohammedans are so
against, yet so concerned; so against but still so attached. They turn
really into negative idol-worshipers. Create an image, create any name,
create anything that you feel can help you move towards the divine. All
names belong to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Old Mohammedan names – old, and still Mohammedans are orthodox and
old.… All old Mohammedan names are names of Allah. All old Hindu names –
but now all names are not old – are names of Rama. Not only have we
tried to give God a thousand names, we have tried to give everyone a
name which really belongs to God. This is symbolic. Every name is God’s
name, and every name – to whomsoever it belongs – indicates a god.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says:</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS BRAHMA, HE IS SHIVA, HE IS INDRA. HE IS INDESTRUCTIBLE, THE
SUPREME, THE SELF-LUMINOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>HE ALONE IS VISHNU, HE IS PRANA. HE IS SUN, FIRE; HE IS THE MOON.</p><p><br></p><p>He is everything. Call him moon, call him sun, call him Vishnu – call
him anything. Whatsoever you call him, remember that the call – the
heartfelt call, the prayerful mood – is important. The name is just a
device to help you to call him.</p><p><br></p><p>HE ALONE IS ALL THAT WAS AND ALL THAT WILL BE, THE ETERNAL. KNOWING
HIM ONE GOES BEYOND THE STING OF DEATH;</p><p>Knowing him one goes beyond the sting of life and death – why? This
has to be understood. Why, if you can understand him, why will you go
beyond life and death? – because life and death belong to the ego. If
you say he is everything that was, if you say he is everything that is,
if you say he is everything that ever will be, that means you are not.
That means he is and you are not; that means the ego is not – and only
the ego is born and only the ego is to die. If he is everything, then he
is birth, he is death, he is life. Then how can you conceive of yourself
as being born, and as dying?</p><p><br></p><p>Birth and death are just two poles of your ego – the feeling that “I
am.” If you drop this feeling, then birth is not the beginning and death
is not the end. Then something always was, before you were born. Really,
you are a continuity, a continuity of the whole past; and when you die,
nothing is dying – only the continuity changes, takes a turn. Around the
corner the continuity will continue. But if you begin to feel between
birth and death that you are, then you will die, then you will have to
feel the suffering of dying.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that you are a continuity. The whole universe is involved in
you; you are not alone. No man is an island, no man is alone and
separate. The world exists as a net, as an interconnection, as
inter-relatedness. The whole world exists as ONE. You are organic to it;
you belong to it.</p><p><br></p><p>If this feeling comes to you. KNOWING HIM ONE GOES BEYOND THE STING
OF life and DEATH; THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH COMPLETE FREEDOM. And
unless you are a non-ego, there is no way to attain complete freedom.
Ego is the slavery, ego is the suffering, ego is the anguish. Ego is the
anxiety, the tension, the disease. So unless there is egolessness... and
egolessness and God-consciousness mean the same thing. If you become
God-conscious, you will become I-unconscious. If you are I-conscious,
then you cannot be God-conscious. This is focusing. If you are focused
on the ego, the whole universe goes into darkness. If you are focused on
the whole universe, the “I” simply disappears. “I” is a focusing of all
the energy on a limited link of an unlimited continuity – one link. One
link of the whole chain is the ego. Remember the whole continuity.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be good if we can think in this way. Could I exist if
something had been different in the universe? – I could not exist. Even
a millennium before, if something had been different from what it was, I
would not be here, because the whole universe is a continuity.
Whatsoever I am saying... if a Buddha had not been there in the past, or
a Jesus had not been there in the past, I couldn’t say this. The whole
universe is a continuity. A single event missed in the past would make
the whole universe different. And when I say a Buddha, you can
understand. But I say, even if a single tree had not been there in the
universe, I would not be here.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole universe exists as a continuity; it is an intermittent
phenomenon. We are here because the universe was such that we could be
here. The whole past was such that this meeting becomes</p><p><br></p><p>possible. Something missing, and the whole thing will change. This
feeling of eternal continuity in the past, of eternal continuity in the
future, will dissolve the ego completely. You are not; you are just a
part – a part which cannot exist alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the destiny of the whole universe becomes your destiny, then you
have no separate individual destiny. That is what is meant by saying one
goes beyond life and death. If you have no individual destiny, the whole
destiny of the universe IS your destiny. Then who is going to die? And
who is going to be born? And who is concerned? Then a total acceptance
explodes, a total acceptance comes. A TATHATA, a total acceptance
happens. This is freedom; this is ultimate freedom. Now you cannot feel
any limitation.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe has never felt limitation. You feel it because you
separate yourself. I will die as an individual, but I cannot die as a
universe. The atoms in my hand will be there; my eyes will be there as
someone else’s eyes; my heart will be there as someone else’s heart. I
will exist in the trees, in the stones, in the earth, in the sky – I
will be there as a universe. I will not be there as myself. My
consciousness will be there as someone else’s consciousness. Or even it
may not be someone else’s consciousness... just a cloud floating in the
sky, or just a silence, or just a drop in the ocean. As myself I am
going to die, but not as a universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This remembrance, this realization is the only freedom – the only and
the ultimate. Unless this happens, you are a slave. You will go on
feeling limitations, you will go on feeling boundaries, you will go on
feeling that this is going to be death, this is going to be birth, this
is going to be pain, this is going to be suffering. To create, or to go
on believing in individual destiny, is irreligion. The beginning of the
feeling that “I am not an individual destiny – destiny belongs to the
universe, I belong to the universe” – is the beginning of freedom, is
the beginning of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is the search for total freedom. And unless the freedom is
total, it is not freedom at all.</p><p><br></p><p>EXPERIENCING ONE’S OWN SELF IN ALL BEINGS AND ALL BEINGS IN THE SELF,
ONE ATTAINS THE HIGHEST BRAHMAN, AND NOT BY ANY OTHER MEANS.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I mean by being aware of a universal destiny: by
dissolving one’s individual, petty destiny one begins to feel then that
he is everything – all. All penetrates into oneself, and one’s own
existence penetrates all. Really, it is saying simply that boundaries
dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>The observer becomes the observed. The knower becomes the known.</p><p>The lover becomes the beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

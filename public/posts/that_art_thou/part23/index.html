What is meditation, and for what does it stand?\nThe Hindi word for meditation is DHYANA; the connotation is very different. By meditation, one thing is meant in English; by DHYANA something else is meant. So first we must understand the basic difference between these two words. Meditation is not a right translation, because by meditation thinking is implied. When we say someone is meditating, it means someone is thinking about something. In meditation an object is implied. In dhyan, no-object is a basic condition. By dhyan is meant a meditative mood without any object.\nObjects must cease, mind must become just a pure mirror – a mirroring, not mirroring anything – just a mirror without any object in it, a pure mirror. By dhyan, this purity of the mind is indicated.\nSo first, no object should be in the mind. Mind must remain alone without thinking about anything – with no thought, just a consciousness, just an awareness, just an alertness.\nThis alertness without any object is meditation.\nSo go on dropping objects. Even if one has to use some object as a help to withdraw other objects from the mind, that one object has to be dropped ultimately. Unless that is dropped, it is not meditation.\nFor example, there are many thoughts in the mind. You can use a mantra; so now there are not many thoughts, just one thought. You can use a name – Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Maria, anything. You go on repeating, “Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.” Between two “Ramas” no gap should be left, because only from that gap a thought enters. If your “Ramas” go on overlapping each other there will be no gap for any thought to enter. Now you have a mind with one thought. It is still not meditation, it is still thinking – thinking one thought. Ultimately this “Rama” has to be dropped. When you have become attuned with one thought and other thoughts are not entering the mind, then drop it and remain without thought. Many thoughts have been dropped except one; then drop the one, so you come to a state of no-thought.\nThis state of no-thought is meditation.\nThis is dhyana, this is pure consciousness.\nIn this pure consciousness is achieved that which is known as BRAHMAN. This sutra is concerned with the definition of that indefinable.\nIt cannot be defined, because definition needs something which becomes impossible with the ultimate reality – definition needs comparison. You cannot define anything without comparing it. That divine is non-dual; it is one, so no comparison is possible. How to define it?\nCan you say that the divine is man, or woman? You cannot say, though many religions have defined it in that way. Some religions are man-oriented, so they define God as father. Some religions are woman-oriented, so they define God as mother. But He cannot be defined, because “man” and “woman”... these words are relevant in human language; they become irrelevant for the whole universe. The whole universe is neither male nor female. How to define it? What to say about it?\nThe moment we use any word to define it, it looks absurd, because every human word implies the contrary also. If you say, “He is light,” then where to put darkness? Then what is darkness? Either you will have to deny darkness absolutely from divine nature, or you will have to imply it somewhere; He must comprehend darkness also. So what to say about Him? – light or darkness? If you say both, they become meaningless. He is both, and He is not both. That is the problem; that’s why He cannot be defined. Every word implies duality: the polar opposite must be there to make the word meaningful. Every word, with the total existence, becomes meaningless.\nBut this sutra tries to define the indefinable – this is only an effort, it never succeeds. But it has to be made. Even in its unsuccessfulness it helps, it indicates. It may not be able to define the divine; it is capable of indicating it.\nWittgenstein has said somewhere, “There are experiences which cannot be said, but which can be shown.” And he is right. There are experiences – you cannot say what they are, but still you can indicate them. This sutra is an indication.\nSome terms have been used; one is: THUS BY MEDITATION THEY ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE REALITY, WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE – WHICH CANNOT BE THOUGHT. Why? – because thinking\nis not, is not something. It is a process of the known; it never leads to the unknown. The unknown is always beyond thinking: You can think something you know;how can you think something which you don’t know?\nAnd then the whole of thinking becomes absurd. If you can think only that which you know, what is the use of it? You know already, so what is the use of thinking it? If only the known can be thought, then the whole process becomes circular: it leads nowhere, you go on in a circle. You know and you think; and you think and you cannot think the unknown. So you go on in a circle – mind works in a circle.\nThe mind never achieves anything from the unknown. So mind must cease, thinking must cease; this circle must be broken! You must come to a standstill: not thinking, not thinking at all. And the moment you are in a no-thinking state, suddenly you enter the unknown.\nIt is not only unknown but unknowable also, because even if you have known it, you cannot make it known to others. By your being, they may feel it – by your movements, by your gestures, by your eyes, by your very presence, they may feel it – but still you cannot make it known to them. You may create a thirst in them for it, but you cannot give them a definition. You may lead them towards it, but you cannot make it known to them – unless they know themselves.\nThis knowing of the unknown is basically, foundationally, an individual affair. It can never be made collective. You cannot go to it EN MASSE Alone one has to reach it; alone one has to drop oneself. Alone one has to enter it; alone one encounters it. It becomes known to you, but you cannot make it known to others.\nThat is the basic difference between science and religion.\nA scientist discovers something, and then the discovery becomes that of the whole of humanity. But a religious mystic discovers, and the discovery remains his own. It never becomes a collective phenomenon. A Jesus knows, a Boehme knows, an Eckhart knows, but they are helpless; they cannot make it a common property. It cannot become an object of common knowing; humanity remains in the some grip of ignorance. Each one has to approach it by oneself.\nThe opening is individual; that’s why it is not only unknown by unknowable. And for one reason more, and that reason is still deeper: even if one comes to know it, one never knows it totally. Even when one comes to know it, no one knows it totally! So the unknowable is infinitely unknowable. Even if you are satisfied, even if your thirst is no more, the infinite unknowability remains – that’s why it is mysterious. And it is good, and it is beautiful that it is so. Because if you can know the divine totally – if the very moment the divine has been known, you have known it totally – it becomes meaningless.\nAnything known totally becomes a thing. Anything known totally creates boredom. Anything known totally will again create a new thirst to know something else.\nBut once the divine is known, no desire to know anything remains – because you can go on in your knowing... deeper, deeper, deeper, infinitely deeper; the abyss is endless. You have a beginning in\nit, but no end. You drop into it, and then you go on dropping, and there comes no substratum, no bottom where you can stand again and say, “Now the dropping has ended.”\nThis is the mystery. That’s why this sutra says: THE FORMLESS, THE WONDERFUL... the mysterious – God is a mysterium. And when I way a mysterium, I mean that you can know it, but still you cannot say, “I have known it.” You can only say, “I have dropped into it”; you can only say, “I have ceased to be”; you can only say, “Now I am no more and He is.” But you cannot say, “I have known it.”\nFor one reason more it remains unknowable: because the knower is lost. The moment you enter the divine you don’t enter as a knower, you enter as a drop of water entering the ocean. You become one with it. The knower is not separate, so how can you say, “I have known it”? How can you say that “I am,” still? You are not; only He is.\nThis is one of the riddles of religious experience: when the knower is lost, the known is known. When the knower is lost, only then knowledge happens.\nKabir has said, “I was searching and searching and searching. Now He is found but the searcher is not. Now He is there but where is Kabir?” The seeker is no more. There has never been a meeting between the seeker and the sought. Never a meeting! – because the two cannot be together. The seeking ends only when the seeker is lost, and only then the sought is found. You are, then He is not. When you are not, then He is; there is no meeting – or you can call this THE MEETING. This is the riddle of religious experience.\n... WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE, UNMANIFEST; THE ONE OF ENDLESS FORMS, THE EVER-AUSPICIOUS, THE PEACEFUL, THE IMMORTAL, THE ORIGIN OF THE CREATOR, THE ONE WITHOUT A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE AND AN END; THE ONLY ONE, THE NON-DUAL, THE ALL- PERVADING, THE CONSCIOUSNESS, THE BLISS, THE\nFORMLESS, THE WONDERFUL... is known through meditation.\nThese are just indications, and every indication is a negative. Remember that – every indication is a negative. He is UNTHINKABLE – you cannot think about it. He is FORMLESS – he is without forms. He has no beginning, no middle, no end. He is NON-DUAL – not two. All these are negatives. Why use so much negativity for such a positive phenomenon as God? He is the positivity; He is the only positive force. Then why use so many negatives? – WITHOUT form, WITHOUT the other, everything – everything that has been used to indicate Him, has remained always negative. Why?\nThere are reasons. The moment you use a positive word, you create a limitation. If I say that He is beautiful, then the ugly is denied. If I say that He is light, then the darkness is denied. If I say that He is good, then the evil is denied. Whatsoever I say positively will deny something.\nTo use a negative term is to say that He is so infinite that we cannot use any positive term, because positivity becomes a limitation. We cannot say, “He is one”; rather, it is good to say, “He is not two.” It is better to say that He is not two; then He is left totally without any positive demarcation. If we say, “He is one,” then we have encircled Him.\nIn meditation, the deeper you go, the more deeply you will come to the positive. But when you want to express it, more and more you will have to use negative terms. The ultimate in using negative terms is Buddha. He has used for this ultimate experience the word NIRVANA. Nirvana simply means cessation. He has not used MOKSHA, liberation, because it is positive; it says something. He has not used BRAHMALOK; it is positive, it says something. He has not used bliss, consciousness – these are positive. He has simply said, nirvana – cessation of everything, nothingness. And he is right, absolutely right. In meditation you will achieve a positive experience. But when you are expressing it, you will have to use absolute negatives.\nIf we can create a world consciousness about this use of negatives, there will be no fight between religions. Every fight is because a religion has used something positive. This is strange, but one has to understand it. If you use the negative, then two negatives are never in conflict; but if you use two positives, then two positives are always in conflict.\nFor example, if Islam says that He is one, and Hinduism says that He is all, one begins to feel some conflict somewhere. Use negatives, and then there is no conflict. If you say that He is not two, then He can be both – He can be one and He can be all. When I say He is not two, I don’t deny that He is not all – He can be all. “He is not two” – He can be all. “He is not two” – He can be one. In saying He is not two, both ends – one and all – are implied. If religions are created around negatives, there will be less fight and more understanding.\nIn the West, all the three religions which have come out of Jewish mystics have all used positives. Christianity, Islam, and the Jewish religion have all used positives. That is one of the reasons they are mostly fighting religions – too much fighting, too much arrogance. They have never used negatives; they have used positive terms. A linguistic factor has created so much violence.…\nAll the Indian religions have used negatives, more and more negatives. And Buddhism is exceptional; Buddhism has used absolute negatives. That’s why Buddhism has been one of the most non-fighting religions.\nIf you use a negative term to indicate the divine, there is no fight. If you use a positive term, a fight is bound to happen. Someone using another... then two positives are always in conflict. Two negatives are never in conflict. That’s why one other strange phenomenon can be understood: Two theists will always be in a fight, but two atheists will never be in a fight, so there are three hundred types of theists in the world, but only one type of atheist.\nWhat is the reason? An atheist anywhere is the same. What is the reason? – the negative, because he stands only with one statement: that there is no God. So how can there be many types of no- Gods? Only one type, one negative, implies everything. The negative is a universal thing: an atheist\nanywhere – in Tibet, in Germany, in Japan, in China, anywhere – an atheist is simply an atheist. He stands on a negative.\nBut theists differ. village to village, neighborhood to neighborhood, theists differ. There are so many brands, and so many types, and so many creeds. Why? The moment you use a positive you have defined an area, and all else is excluded. Unless theists also begin to use use negatives more, there will not be a universal religion. If theism also bases itself on a negative definition of the divine, then there can be a universal brotherhood.\nMeditation leads you to all. But never define it as positive; always define it as nothingness. So meditation has two parts: the creative part as positive, the expressive part as negative.\nTwo things more: If we understand by “meditation” a state of no-thinking, then this state of no- thinking can be created in many ways. One, I talked about: you can use one word, one mantra to deny many many thoughts in the mind – this is one way. But there is a basic difficulty in it, because you will have to use one word so much that you may be capable of throwing all else outside. But then this word will become so rooted in you that it will be difficult to throw IT out. You have used it so much as a device that it will be very difficult to throw it out. Then it will take the whole place; then meditation is not achieved.\nTo use a name as a repetition has its own difficulties. It is easy to throw out all else, but then it is difficult to throw out itself. If you have used “Rama” to throw out all other thoughts, it will become rooted in you, and then you cannot throw it out. It will be very difficult and very painful. Then something else will be needed to throw it out. As far as I am concerned, I never suggest this method. It is better to begin with no word. Then how to begin?\nTake the total energy of your body and mind as the beginning. Let you total body-mind energy be involved in it. Make it so active – let your body energy, your mind energy becomes so active, so active at the peak – that thoughts dissolve, because thoughts cannot exist at the peak. When your energy is moving vigorously, thoughts are thrown out. Even in ordinary things: if you are running fast, you cannot think. Try it! Go on round and round, running fast. You cannot think, because the whole energy is absorbed by running, and thoughts cannot get energy.\nWe are aware – we may not have understood – when you have eaten much, you cannot think; that’s why one feels sleepy. If you have eaten much, you begin to feel sleepy. Why? How is the food concerned with your thinking and sleep? You cannot think; the energy is taken by your stomach. Now the stomach needs energy and the energy is withdrawn from the mind, so mind cannot think. Too much eating will create a very mediocre mind – it cannot think. So thinkers have always been, in many ways, good fasters. They can fast, because the moment you fast the stomach needs no energy, and then the energy can be given to the mind and the mind can think.\nA Mahavira, a Buddha, a Mohammed, a Jesus – they are all fasters; they have fasted long. And then their total energy is released and their mind can use it.\nSo, as far I am concerned, my method is to let you energy work so totally that mind is devoid of energy.\nThis morning meditation uses this technique. Ten minutes of fast breathing – your mind just cannot get any energy. And fast breathing gives your blood more oxygen; the blood begins to run more quickly, your body electricity is helped by oxygen – it begins to be active. Then ten minutes’ jumping, crying, laughing – just going mad – gives your total energy an outlet. Mind cannot get anything out of it; thoughts are dropped. Then using “hoo” – not as a word, but as a sound, remember. “Hoo” is not to be used as a word. It is meaningless, it is just a sound – a mad sound with no meaning. Then using this “hoo,” the more vigorously you use it, it hammers the KUNDALINI. It hammers the kundalini; it goes down to the very sex center and hammers. This “hoo” is to be used as a hammering, not as a mantra; it is a hammering, just a device.\nNow when your energy is in a climax – at the peak – this “hoo” hammers the kundalini and the kundalini begins to go up. When it begins to go up, the kundalini needs your total energy, and mind cannot function at all. Total energy is now on a new route – the route is kundalini. First you have to make it alert and creative – alive. Then you have to force it into the kundalini route. This “hoo” helps to hammer it and to force it through the backbone, upwards – then the kundalini moves. Once the kundalini begins to move, your mind cannot get any energy to think.\nThen comes the fourth step: just lying down as if dead, the energy moving upwards. That’s why lying down is good. If you are standing, then for the movement of the energy it is a bit difficult. If you are sitting, then too it is a bit difficult. So lie down just as if dead, flat on the ground, so the energy can move easily.\nOnce energy begins to move in the kundalini, mind cannot think. No-thought is achieved. And in no-thought, meditation happens.\nOne thing more: no-thought can be achieved in another way also – that is unconsciousness. You can become unconscious; then there is no thought. But then there is no consciousness also. So one can hypnotize oneself into unconsciousness. That gives you a feeling as if you have achieved meditation; you have not achieved. So don’t fall into a sleep.\nBut this meditation will not allow you to fall in a sleep. Such vigorous movement of body energy for thirty minutes will not allow you to drop into sleep; otherwise, many meditators feel that whenever they begin to make any JAPA – RAM NAM, et cetera, they begin to feel sleepy, they begin to doze, feel drowsy. That too is a hindrance. If you begin to feel drowsy, if you begin to feel sleepy, and if you become unconscious, then nothing is achieved – except a deep sleep. It is good for health, but nothing for meditation is achieved. It is relaxing, it is refreshing, but only for the body – nothing for consciousness is achieved.\nThat’s why I insist so much on this violent meditation, not on silent meditation. Through silent meditation also, the ultimate can be achieved, but sleep comes as a barrier. With this violent, active meditation, sleep is not a barrier at all. It cannot come. It cannot come; at least for ten or fifteen minutes after the exercise sleep is impossible. You remain conscious and alert, with a no- thought mind. In this, meditation can happen – this is just a situation. You cannot force meditation, you can only create the situation. And if the situation is created rightly, then meditation happens automatically.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3803","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/>That Art Thou</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 Kaivalya Upanishad</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3803 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/That_Art_Thou/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

UNTHINKABLE, UNMANIFEST; THE ONE OF ENDLESS FORMS, THE EVER-AUSPICIOUS,
THE PEACEFUL, THE IMMORTAL, THE ORIGIN OF THE CREATOR, THE ONE WITHOUT A
BEGINNING, A MIDDLE AND AN END; THE ONLY ONE, THE NON-DUAL, THE
ALL-PERVADING, THE CONSCIOUSNESS, THE BLISS, THE FORMLESS, THE
WONDERFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra is basically concerned with meditation: What is to be
attained by meditation? What is meditation, and for what does it
stand?</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindi word for meditation is DHYANA; the connotation is very
different. By meditation, one thing is meant in English; by DHYANA
something else is meant. So first we must understand the basic
difference between these two words. Meditation is not a right
translation, because by meditation thinking is implied. When we say
someone is meditating, it means someone is thinking about something. In
meditation an object is implied. In dhyan, no-object is a basic
condition. By dhyan is meant a meditative mood without any object.</p><p><br></p><p>Objects must cease, mind must become just a pure mirror – a
mirroring, not mirroring anything – just a mirror without any object in
it, a pure mirror. By dhyan, this purity of the mind is indicated.</p><p><br></p><p>So first, no object should be in the mind. Mind must remain alone
without thinking about anything – with no thought, just a consciousness,
just an awareness, just an alertness.</p><p><br></p><p>This alertness without any object is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So go on dropping objects. Even if one has to use some object as a
help to withdraw other objects from the mind, that one object has to be
dropped ultimately. Unless that is dropped, it is not meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there are many thoughts in the mind. You can use a
mantra; so now there are not many thoughts, just one thought. You can
use a name – Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Maria, anything. You go on repeating,
“Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.” Between two “Ramas” no gap should be left,
because only from that gap a thought enters. If your “Ramas” go on
overlapping each other there will be no gap for any thought to enter.
Now you have a mind with one thought. It is still not meditation, it is
still thinking – thinking one thought. Ultimately this “Rama” has to be
dropped. When you have become attuned with one thought and other
thoughts are not entering the mind, then drop it and remain without
thought. Many thoughts have been dropped except one; then drop the one,
so you come to a state of no-thought.</p><p><br></p><p>This state of no-thought is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>This is dhyana, this is pure consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>In this pure consciousness is achieved that which is known as
BRAHMAN. This sutra is concerned with the definition of that
indefinable.</p><p><br></p><p>It cannot be defined, because definition needs something which
becomes impossible with the ultimate reality – definition needs
comparison. You cannot define anything without comparing it. That divine
is non-dual; it is one, so no comparison is possible. How to define
it?</p><p><br></p><p>Can you say that the divine is man, or woman? You cannot say, though
many religions have defined it in that way. Some religions are
man-oriented, so they define God as father. Some religions are
woman-oriented, so they define God as mother. But He cannot be defined,
because “man” and “woman”... these words are relevant in human language;
they become irrelevant for the whole universe. The whole universe is
neither male nor female. How to define it? What to say about it?</p><p><br></p><p>The moment we use any word to define it, it looks absurd, because
every human word implies the contrary also. If you say, “He is light,”
then where to put darkness? Then what is darkness? Either you will have
to deny darkness absolutely from divine nature, or you will have to
imply it somewhere; He must comprehend darkness also. So what to say
about Him? – light or darkness? If you say both, they become
meaningless. He is both, and He is not both. That is the problem; that’s
why He cannot be defined. Every word implies duality: the polar opposite
must be there to make the word meaningful. Every word, with the total
existence, becomes meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>But this sutra tries to define the indefinable – this is only an
effort, it never succeeds. But it has to be made. Even in its
unsuccessfulness it helps, it indicates. It may not be able to define
the divine; it is capable of indicating it.</p><p><br></p><p>Wittgenstein has said somewhere, “There are experiences which cannot
be said, but which can be shown.” And he is right. There are experiences
– you cannot say what they are, but still you can indicate them. This
sutra is an indication.</p><p><br></p><p>Some terms have been used; one is: THUS BY MEDITATION THEY ACHIEVE
THE ULTIMATE REALITY, WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE – WHICH CANNOT BE THOUGHT.
Why? – because thinking</p><p>is not, is not something. It is a process of the known; it never
leads to the unknown. The unknown is always beyond thinking: You can
think something you know;how can you think something which you don’t
know?</p><p><br></p><p>And then the whole of thinking becomes absurd. If you can think only
that which you know, what is the use of it? You know already, so what is
the use of thinking it? If only the known can be thought, then the whole
process becomes circular: it leads nowhere, you go on in a circle. You
know and you think; and you think and you cannot think the unknown. So
you go on in a circle – mind works in a circle.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind never achieves anything from the unknown. So mind must
cease, thinking must cease; this circle must be broken! You must come to
a standstill: not thinking, not thinking at all. And the moment you are
in a no-thinking state, suddenly you enter the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only unknown but unknowable also, because even if you have
known it, you cannot make it known to others. By your being, they may
feel it – by your movements, by your gestures, by your eyes, by your
very presence, they may feel it – but still you cannot make it known to
them. You may create a thirst in them for it, but you cannot give them a
definition. You may lead them towards it, but you cannot make it known
to them – unless they know themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>This knowing of the unknown is basically, foundationally, an
individual affair. It can never be made collective. You cannot go to it
EN MASSE Alone one has to reach it; alone one has to drop oneself. Alone
one has to enter it; alone one encounters it. It becomes known to you,
but you cannot make it known to others.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the basic difference between science and religion.</p><p><br></p><p>A scientist discovers something, and then the discovery becomes that
of the whole of humanity. But a religious mystic discovers, and the
discovery remains his own. It never becomes a collective phenomenon. A
Jesus knows, a Boehme knows, an Eckhart knows, but they are helpless;
they cannot make it a common property. It cannot become an object of
common knowing; humanity remains in the some grip of ignorance. Each one
has to approach it by oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>The opening is individual; that’s why it is not only unknown by
unknowable. And for one reason more, and that reason is still deeper:
even if one comes to know it, one never knows it totally. Even when one
comes to know it, no one knows it totally! So the unknowable is
infinitely unknowable. Even if you are satisfied, even if your thirst is
no more, the infinite unknowability remains – that’s why it is
mysterious. And it is good, and it is beautiful that it is so. Because
if you can know the divine totally – if the very moment the divine has
been known, you have known it totally – it becomes meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything known totally becomes a thing. Anything known totally
creates boredom. Anything known totally will again create a new thirst
to know something else.</p><p><br></p><p>But once the divine is known, no desire to know anything remains –
because you can go on in your knowing... deeper, deeper, deeper,
infinitely deeper; the abyss is endless. You have a beginning in</p><p><br></p><p>it, but no end. You drop into it, and then you go on dropping, and
there comes no substratum, no bottom where you can stand again and say,
“Now the dropping has ended.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the mystery. That’s why this sutra says: THE FORMLESS, THE
WONDERFUL... the mysterious – God is a mysterium. And when I way a
mysterium, I mean that you can know it, but still you cannot say, “I
have known it.” You can only say, “I have dropped into it”; you can only
say, “I have ceased to be”; you can only say, “Now I am no more and He
is.” But you cannot say, “I have known it.”</p><p><br></p><p>For one reason more it remains unknowable: because the knower is
lost. The moment you enter the divine you don’t enter as a knower, you
enter as a drop of water entering the ocean. You become one with it. The
knower is not separate, so how can you say, “I have known it”? How can
you say that “I am,” still? You are not; only He is.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the riddles of religious experience: when the knower
is lost, the known is known. When the knower is lost, only then
knowledge happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir has said, “I was searching and searching and searching. Now He
is found but the searcher is not. Now He is there but where is Kabir?”
The seeker is no more. There has never been a meeting between the seeker
and the sought. Never a meeting! – because the two cannot be together.
The seeking ends only when the seeker is lost, and only then the sought
is found. You are, then He is not. When you are not, then He is; there
is no meeting – or you can call this THE MEETING. This is the riddle of
religious experience.</p><p><br></p><p>... WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE, UNMANIFEST; THE ONE OF ENDLESS FORMS, THE
EVER-AUSPICIOUS, THE PEACEFUL, THE IMMORTAL, THE ORIGIN OF THE CREATOR,
THE ONE WITHOUT A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE AND AN END; THE ONLY ONE, THE
NON-DUAL, THE ALL- PERVADING, THE CONSCIOUSNESS, THE BLISS, THE</p><p>FORMLESS, THE WONDERFUL... is known through meditation.</p><p>These are just indications, and every indication is a negative.
Remember that – every indication is a negative. He is UNTHINKABLE – you
cannot think about it. He is FORMLESS – he is without forms. He has no
beginning, no middle, no end. He is NON-DUAL – not two. All these are
negatives. Why use so much negativity for such a positive phenomenon as
God? He is the positivity; He is the only positive force. Then why use
so many negatives? – WITHOUT form, WITHOUT the other, everything –
everything that has been used to indicate Him, has remained always
negative. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>There are reasons. The moment you use a positive word, you create a
limitation. If I say that He is beautiful, then the ugly is denied. If I
say that He is light, then the darkness is denied. If I say that He is
good, then the evil is denied. Whatsoever I say positively will deny
something.</p><p><br></p><p>To use a negative term is to say that He is so infinite that we
cannot use any positive term, because positivity becomes a limitation.
We cannot say, “He is one”; rather, it is good to say, “He is not two.”
It is better to say that He is not two; then He is left totally without
any positive demarcation. If we say, “He is one,” then we have encircled
Him.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, the deeper you go, the more deeply you will come to
the positive. But when you want to express it, more and more you will
have to use negative terms. The ultimate in using negative terms is
Buddha. He has used for this ultimate experience the word NIRVANA.
Nirvana simply means cessation. He has not used MOKSHA, liberation,
because it is positive; it says something. He has not used BRAHMALOK; it
is positive, it says something. He has not used bliss, consciousness –
these are positive. He has simply said, nirvana – cessation of
everything, nothingness. And he is right, absolutely right. In
meditation you will achieve a positive experience. But when you are
expressing it, you will have to use absolute negatives.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can create a world consciousness about this use of negatives,
there will be no fight between religions. Every fight is because a
religion has used something positive. This is strange, but one has to
understand it. If you use the negative, then two negatives are never in
conflict; but if you use two positives, then two positives are always in
conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if Islam says that He is one, and Hinduism says that He
is all, one begins to feel some conflict somewhere. Use negatives, and
then there is no conflict. If you say that He is not two, then He can be
both – He can be one and He can be all. When I say He is not two, I
don’t deny that He is not all – He can be all. “He is not two” – He can
be all. “He is not two” – He can be one. In saying He is not two, both
ends – one and all – are implied. If religions are created around
negatives, there will be less fight and more understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, all the three religions which have come out of Jewish
mystics have all used positives. Christianity, Islam, and the Jewish
religion have all used positives. That is one of the reasons they are
mostly fighting religions – too much fighting, too much arrogance. They
have never used negatives; they have used positive terms. A linguistic
factor has created so much violence.…</p><p><br></p><p>All the Indian religions have used negatives, more and more
negatives. And Buddhism is exceptional; Buddhism has used absolute
negatives. That’s why Buddhism has been one of the most non-fighting
religions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you use a negative term to indicate the divine, there is no fight.
If you use a positive term, a fight is bound to happen. Someone using
another... then two positives are always in conflict. Two negatives are
never in conflict. That’s why one other strange phenomenon can be
understood: Two theists will always be in a fight, but two atheists will
never be in a fight, so there are three hundred types of theists in the
world, but only one type of atheist.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the reason? An atheist anywhere is the same. What is the
reason? – the negative, because he stands only with one statement: that
there is no God. So how can there be many types of no- Gods? Only one
type, one negative, implies everything. The negative is a universal
thing: an atheist</p><p><br></p><p>anywhere – in Tibet, in Germany, in Japan, in China, anywhere – an
atheist is simply an atheist. He stands on a negative.</p><p><br></p><p>But theists differ. village to village, neighborhood to neighborhood,
theists differ. There are so many brands, and so many types, and so many
creeds. Why? The moment you use a positive you have defined an area, and
all else is excluded. Unless theists also begin to use use negatives
more, there will not be a universal religion. If theism also bases
itself on a negative definition of the divine, then there can be a
universal brotherhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation leads you to all. But never define it as positive; always
define it as nothingness. So meditation has two parts: the creative part
as positive, the expressive part as negative.</p><p>Two things more: If we understand by “meditation” a state of
no-thinking, then this state of no- thinking can be created in many
ways. One, I talked about: you can use one word, one mantra to deny many
many thoughts in the mind – this is one way. But there is a basic
difficulty in it, because you will have to use one word so much that you
may be capable of throwing all else outside. But then this word will
become so rooted in you that it will be difficult to throw IT out. You
have used it so much as a device that it will be very difficult to throw
it out. Then it will take the whole place; then meditation is not
achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>To use a name as a repetition has its own difficulties. It is easy to
throw out all else, but then it is difficult to throw out itself. If you
have used “Rama” to throw out all other thoughts, it will become rooted
in you, and then you cannot throw it out. It will be very difficult and
very painful. Then something else will be needed to throw it out. As far
as I am concerned, I never suggest this method. It is better to begin
with no word. Then how to begin?</p><p><br></p><p>Take the total energy of your body and mind as the beginning. Let you
total body-mind energy be involved in it. Make it so active – let your
body energy, your mind energy becomes so active, so active at the peak –
that thoughts dissolve, because thoughts cannot exist at the peak. When
your energy is moving vigorously, thoughts are thrown out. Even in
ordinary things: if you are running fast, you cannot think. Try it! Go
on round and round, running fast. You cannot think, because the whole
energy is absorbed by running, and thoughts cannot get energy.</p><p><br></p><p>We are aware – we may not have understood – when you have eaten much,
you cannot think; that’s why one feels sleepy. If you have eaten much,
you begin to feel sleepy. Why? How is the food concerned with your
thinking and sleep? You cannot think; the energy is taken by your
stomach. Now the stomach needs energy and the energy is withdrawn from
the mind, so mind cannot think. Too much eating will create a very
mediocre mind – it cannot think. So thinkers have always been, in many
ways, good fasters. They can fast, because the moment you fast the
stomach needs no energy, and then the energy can be given to the mind
and the mind can think.</p><p><br></p><p>A Mahavira, a Buddha, a Mohammed, a Jesus – they are all fasters;
they have fasted long. And then their total energy is released and their
mind can use it.</p><p><br></p><p>So, as far I am concerned, my method is to let you energy work so
totally that mind is devoid of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>This morning meditation uses this technique. Ten minutes of fast
breathing – your mind just cannot get any energy. And fast breathing
gives your blood more oxygen; the blood begins to run more quickly, your
body electricity is helped by oxygen – it begins to be active. Then ten
minutes’ jumping, crying, laughing – just going mad – gives your total
energy an outlet. Mind cannot get anything out of it; thoughts are
dropped. Then using “hoo” – not as a word, but as a sound, remember.
“Hoo” is not to be used as a word. It is meaningless, it is just a sound
– a mad sound with no meaning. Then using this “hoo,” the more
vigorously you use it, it hammers the KUNDALINI. It hammers the
kundalini; it goes down to the very sex center and hammers. This “hoo”
is to be used as a hammering, not as a mantra; it is a hammering, just a
device.</p><p><br></p><p>Now when your energy is in a climax – at the peak – this “hoo”
hammers the kundalini and the kundalini begins to go up. When it begins
to go up, the kundalini needs your total energy, and mind cannot
function at all. Total energy is now on a new route – the route is
kundalini. First you have to make it alert and creative – alive. Then
you have to force it into the kundalini route. This “hoo” helps to
hammer it and to force it through the backbone, upwards – then the
kundalini moves. Once the kundalini begins to move, your mind cannot get
any energy to think.</p><p><br></p><p>Then comes the fourth step: just lying down as if dead, the energy
moving upwards. That’s why lying down is good. If you are standing, then
for the movement of the energy it is a bit difficult. If you are
sitting, then too it is a bit difficult. So lie down just as if dead,
flat on the ground, so the energy can move easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Once energy begins to move in the kundalini, mind cannot think.
No-thought is achieved. And in no-thought, meditation happens.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more: no-thought can be achieved in another way also – that
is unconsciousness. You can become unconscious; then there is no
thought. But then there is no consciousness also. So one can hypnotize
oneself into unconsciousness. That gives you a feeling as if you have
achieved meditation; you have not achieved. So don’t fall into a
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>But this meditation will not allow you to fall in a sleep. Such
vigorous movement of body energy for thirty minutes will not allow you
to drop into sleep; otherwise, many meditators feel that whenever they
begin to make any JAPA – RAM NAM, et cetera, they begin to feel sleepy,
they begin to doze, feel drowsy. That too is a hindrance. If you begin
to feel drowsy, if you begin to feel sleepy, and if you become
unconscious, then nothing is achieved – except a deep sleep. It is good
for health, but nothing for meditation is achieved. It is relaxing, it
is refreshing, but only for the body – nothing for consciousness is
achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I insist so much on this violent meditation, not on silent
meditation. Through silent meditation also, the ultimate can be
achieved, but sleep comes as a barrier. With this violent, active
meditation, sleep is not a barrier at all. It cannot come. It cannot
come; at least for ten or fifteen minutes after the exercise sleep is
impossible. You remain conscious and alert, with a no- thought mind. In
this, meditation can happen – this is just a situation. You cannot force
meditation, you can only create the situation. And if the situation is
created rightly, then meditation happens automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

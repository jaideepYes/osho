The third is known as the mental body, as the mind-body. This third is constituted of thoughts. But the science of yoga believes that thoughts are not only thoughts, they are things, they are substantial; they ARE. They have an existence of their own – a very subtle existence, but there is existence. So whenever a thought goes into you, you are changing your mind-body; you are giving food to it. And we are so unaware about this phenomenon, that the mind is being fed every moment, and we are giving it anything, without any choice – it is just a confusion.\nWhatsoever we go on giving to the mind, we are only concerned that it must remain occupied; that’s all. Occupation in itself becomes an aim. One should not be unoccupied, so go on reading anything, go on listening to anything, go on seeing anything, go on... do something with the mind!\nSo whatsoever is around, we are vulnerable to it. This is fatal, because then you create a very confused mind-body, very confused – with contradictions, with infinite contradictions. And that’s the reason there is so much anguish, so much tension, and so much misery inside. That’s the reason the mind is just mad.\nNow psychologists say that really no one is normal, and there are only two types of abnormalities: one, normal abnormality – another, abnormal abnormality. So there are two types of insane people: one, who are insane in a socially accepted way – another, who are insane in their individual whims.\nBut everyone seems to be insane. And it is because we have never thought that our mind-body requires an inner harmony, an inner music. Thoughts should not be in contradiction; thoughts must be in a certain harmony, in a certain inner balance; otherwise, you become just a crowd – you are a crowd! C.J. Jung came to realize that no one has a mind: everyone is many minds; everyone is polypsychic. We go on talking about “my mind” – never talk about it again! You are just a crowd, not even a group, but a crowd; and not even a crowd, but a warring crowd – each thought fighting with someone else.\nGurdjieff used to say that man is just like a palace where there are so many slaves, but the master has gone out. And he has been out for such a long time that the slaves have now completely forgotten that there was a master. Now, whenever someone passes by the palace... and it is such a beautiful palace that everyone wants to enquire to whom it belongs. So any slave who happens to be on the door says, “It belongs to me. I am the master.” But another time, the same person passes by; someone else is on the door, and he asks, “To whom does this palace belong?” He says, “It belongs to me, I am the master.” So the whole city is confused, “Who is the master?” Everyone says, “I am the master” – every slave.\nGurdjieff used to say, “Such is the condition of man. Every thought that passes, even on your surface mind, becomes the master; and the master is either asleep or has gone for a long journey and has not come back. And it has been so long.”\nThat’s why we have no will. We cannot have a will if we are just a crowd. You decide to do something, and the second moment you decide not to do it. And the third moment, neither you are decisive to do it, nor even not to do it – you are simply indecisive. You decide that you are going to be awake in the morning at four o’clock; and then at four o’clock you yourself say, “There is no need.” Another slave is on the surface of your mind, not you – the same one is not here who decided. In the morning when you are awake at eight o’clock, you begin to repent, “Why, when I had decided.why couldn’t\nI get up? Why? This is the third. And these three will never meet; they have no dialogue – they are just atomic thoughts. And any atomic thought on the surface becomes the master. You cannot have the will; really, you cannot have any soul. You are not an individual.\nYou must know the meaning of the word “individual.” It means indivisible, that which cannot be divided. But we exist in division, so we cannot be said to be individuals. We are just a divided crowd. Yoga is the science of individuation. It is how to create the individual, how to crystallize this crowd into one, how to create a center which can be the master always, and how to put every slave in its place.\nThen you will need a purification of your mind; you will need a catharsis – a deep catharsis is needed then. You have to throw out all that is just contradictory; you have to create a harmony in\nyour thoughts. And don’t allow any thought to come in, because to allow it to be in is easy, but then to displace it from there is very difficult.\nSo the first thing is don’t allow inside, thoughts which are not going to help create a harmony, and then go on searching for, and observing what contradictory thoughts you have. Be the chosen. Emphasize the thoughts which can create an inner peace and inner silence – then you have a purified mental body. And with this body-transparent you can look beyond, and you can go to another body.\nBeyond the mind-body is the fourth, the fourth body. The fourth body is known as the consciousness- body – VIGYAN MAYKOS. It will be difficult, a bit difficult, to distinguish between the mental body and the conscious body, because we don’t know any consciousness except the mind. But if the mind is purified, then you become simply aware that something else is still behind the mind, and the mind becomes a door. But we can understand.…\nYou have thoughts – that’s one thing – but you can be aware of your thoughts; and this awareness is not a thought at all. You have anger – this is a thought, a thought process. You can be aware of it: “Now in me is running a thought process, a combination of thoughts which is known as anger, or jealousy, or love.” You can be aware. You can stand out of it and be aware that this is anger. You can be aware, “This is a thought.” This awareness that, “this is a thought,” this observation, this possibility to observe the thought process, creates the fourth body. So everyone doesn’t have the fourth body really developed, but only as a potentiality, only as a possibility.\nWhen you become aware of your mind, only then you have the fourth body, and then there is a growth. Sometimes we have glimpses, sometimes we become aware. In moments of sudden danger, in accidents, in encountering a situation we have not faced before – we become aware, because for the first time, the mind in the shock of the accident or of a dangerous situation – in that shock the mind stops.\nFor example: If someone suddenly throws a dagger into you, the mind will stop, because there is nothing to do now or to think. Thought will stop. And when thought stops, you become aware. You become aware that thought has stopped, but still there is consciousness: “I am conscious.”\nThis is the fourth body, the consciousness body, our conscious body. We have it but in a very undeveloped form. To develop it is arduous, because it needs much effort to remain conscious of every thought that passes through your mind, of every thought that has become an accumulation in your mind – a part of your mind, all the conditionings of the mind – to become aware of them is arduous. It is difficult, but not impossible; and only when this becomes possible, you have the dignity of being called a human being; otherwise, not. Because an unconscious human being means nothing. Then you are just being thrown from here and there by impressions and influences from the outside. When you become conscious then you cannot be influenced! For the first time you become the chooser.\nBuddha was passing a village and many people came to him with great abuse; they were condemning him, abusing him, throwing stones at him, and he was just standing there. Then someone asked, “Now what are you going to do?”\nBuddha said, “Nothing, because now I have become the chooser. You cannot manipulate me; you can abuse me – that is up to you – but you cannot create the reaction. You cannot manipulate me. If you abuse me and I react – and the reaction can be predicted by you – then it is just a manipulation. I am nowhere in it. You push the button and the anger is there.”\nReaction means that you have no conscious body developed, so you go on reacting. Really, when you go on reacting, those reactions cannot be said to be actions, because actions come only with a conscious body, developed and mature. Then you ACT; otherwise, you go on reacting. Someone says this, so you say that; someone does this, so you react in that way, and everything is predictable.\nWe know when the husband comes back home in the evening, he knows what is going to happen. The whole scene is predictable: what the wife is going to ask... he knows the question already, and now he is preparing answers. And the wife knows already what answers he is going to give. The whole game is predictable, and daily it is repeated. What are we doing? The husband knows very well that whatsoever he says, whatsoever he may say, it is not going to be believed; and still, he will answer in the same way. And the wife knows that whatsoever and howsoever she may ask, he is going to give the deceptive answer, but still she goes on asking.\nIs there a dialogue? Impossible. There is just a deceptive game that both are playing. And this continues for their whole lives. People go on reacting in the same old routine way. Why? If I know that if I ask THIS question, THAT answer is to be given; and if I am conscious, there is no need to ask. The whole thing is just absurd; there is no need to ask. And I have asked many times, and many times I have been frustrated – and – and again the same thing. Really, we are not conscious.\nThe moment the husband enters the house, the question comes out – it is not the wife who is asking it – it is just mechanical. The question comes out, and the moment there is a question, the answer is manipulated.\nHave you ever done anything as a conscious agent, as a conscious action? No. If you have done, then you must have become aware of a different thing than the mind. The awareness of mind, the consciousness of the thought process, this standing outside the mind – beyond, just as an onlooker, an observer – is the fourth body. The third body is constituted of thoughts; the fourth body is constituted of consciousness.\nThe fifth body is known as the bliss body. This is the last, the innermost body – but still the body. When the fourth body is purified, when the fourth body becomes just a transparency, the fifth is realized, because the fourth becomes so transparent then the fifth is felt directly. That’s why, when you are in deep meditation you don’t feel meditation, you feel bliss. When you are deep in meditation, when you are deep in awareness, you don’t feel awareness, you feel bliss.\nWhen you begin to feel bliss, that means now you have begun to be aware. Awareness creates the situation in which bliss is felt.\nAwareness creates the transparency of the fourth body, and the fifth is seen. The fourth becomes so transparent, that not only you can SEE through it, you can PASS through it without any resistance – it is just a door, it is just an opening. This fifth body is the bliss-body. This bliss is already there. It is\nnot to be found somewhere else, it is not to be achieved; it is there only to be discovered. And you discover it by purifying the fourth body.\nBut this, too, is just a body and has to be transcended; bliss also has to be transcended. One has to go beyond, because if your cannot go beyond bliss, you are still off the center. Because bliss is still an experience, and the experiencer is still beyond.\nSo whatsoever you can feel will belong to some body, this or that. All experiences belong to these five bodies.\nAnd when there is no experience, only the experiencer remains. When there is no known object, only the knower remains.\nWhen there is nothing to be witnessed, but only the witness is, then you are centered in yourself – then you ARE; otherwise, you belong to this body or that.\nThis is not a body.\nThis is the original nature.\nThis is the existential source of all being.\nTwo or three things more. When you transcend the bliss-body, you transcend individuality also. When you transcend the bliss-body, you transcend life and death also, because life and death are phenomena which exist only in the bodies, and in relation to the bodies. Where there is no body, you cannot die and you cannot be reborn. So once one becomes aware of the no-body existence of the center, then there is no death and no life – then you are existence itself. Then there is no individuality, then you are not, simply the being is. All form and all name is lost.\nMeditation is the method to purify the fourth.\nThen what to do with the fifth... how to transcend it? How to transcend bliss itself? It is difficult to understand because we don’t know bliss at all, so how to transcend it is irrelevant. First one has to know, and the moment you know you will know the key to transcend it.\nThe key is known very easily because this is the last body. With every body it is difficult, because again you face another body. So you transcend one body, but again you are rooted in another. When you reach the bliss body, the next behind, then behind the bliss body – for the first time – there is no body now. Now you are near the very center of existence. And it has a gravitation of its own: that gravitation is known as grace.\nYou throw something, and gravitation pulls it down, mm? – the earth pulls it down. But beyond two hundred miles above the earth, around earth, gravitation cannot work. So the moment a spaceship passes the two-hundred-miles’ barrier, the earth cannot pull it down. This is the boundary of earth’s pull – two hundred miles.\nThe bliss body is just the boundary of the no-body existence. And when you are in the bliss body, you are in the pull. Now a new gravitation begins to work; that gravitation is known as grace. That’s why\nthose who achieve the state beyond all bodies say, “This is not by our effort that we have reached it; it is by God and His grace.”\nReally, with the fifth, nothing is to be done anyway. You have only to reach to the fifth – that reaching itself is the doing.\nReach the fifth, and you will be pulled.\nThe reaching itself is anyway transcendence.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2787","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/>That Art Thou</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Sarvasar Upanishad</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2787 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/That_Art_Thou/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

we cannot be said to be individuals. We are just a divided crowd. Yoga
is the science of individuation. It is how to create the individual, how
to crystallize this crowd into one, how to create a center which can be
the master always, and how to put every slave in its place.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will need a purification of your mind; you will need a
catharsis – a deep catharsis is needed then. You have to throw out all
that is just contradictory; you have to create a harmony in</p><p><br></p><p>your thoughts. And don’t allow any thought to come in, because to
allow it to be in is easy, but then to displace it from there is very
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is don’t allow inside, thoughts which are not
going to help create a harmony, and then go on searching for, and
observing what contradictory thoughts you have. Be the chosen. Emphasize
the thoughts which can create an inner peace and inner silence – then
you have a purified mental body. And with this body-transparent you can
look beyond, and you can go to another body.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the mind-body is the fourth, the fourth body. The fourth body
is known as the consciousness- body – VIGYAN MAYKOS. It will be
difficult, a bit difficult, to distinguish between the mental body and
the conscious body, because we don’t know any consciousness except the
mind. But if the mind is purified, then you become simply aware that
something else is still behind the mind, and the mind becomes a door.
But we can understand.…</p><p><br></p><p>You have thoughts – that’s one thing – but you can be aware of your
thoughts; and this awareness is not a thought at all. You have anger –
this is a thought, a thought process. You can be aware of it: “Now in me
is running a thought process, a combination of thoughts which is known
as anger, or jealousy, or love.” You can be aware. You can stand out of
it and be aware that this is anger. You can be aware, “This is a
thought.” This awareness that, “this is a thought,” this observation,
this possibility to observe the thought process, creates the fourth
body. So everyone doesn’t have the fourth body really developed, but
only as a potentiality, only as a possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become aware of your mind, only then you have the fourth
body, and then there is a growth. Sometimes we have glimpses, sometimes
we become aware. In moments of sudden danger, in accidents, in
encountering a situation we have not faced before – we become aware,
because for the first time, the mind in the shock of the accident or of
a dangerous situation – in that shock the mind stops.</p><p><br></p><p>For example: If someone suddenly throws a dagger into you, the mind
will stop, because there is nothing to do now or to think. Thought will
stop. And when thought stops, you become aware. You become aware that
thought has stopped, but still there is consciousness: “I am
conscious.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the fourth body, the consciousness body, our conscious body.
We have it but in a very undeveloped form. To develop it is arduous,
because it needs much effort to remain conscious of every thought that
passes through your mind, of every thought that has become an
accumulation in your mind – a part of your mind, all the conditionings
of the mind – to become aware of them is arduous. It is difficult, but
not impossible; and only when this becomes possible, you have the
dignity of being called a human being; otherwise, not. Because an
unconscious human being means nothing. Then you are just being thrown
from here and there by impressions and influences from the outside. When
you become conscious then you cannot be influenced! For the first time
you become the chooser.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was passing a village and many people came to him with great
abuse; they were condemning him, abusing him, throwing stones at him,
and he was just standing there. Then someone asked, “Now what are you
going to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Nothing, because now I have become the chooser. You
cannot manipulate me; you can abuse me – that is up to you – but you
cannot create the reaction. You cannot manipulate me. If you abuse me
and I react – and the reaction can be predicted by you – then it is just
a manipulation. I am nowhere in it. You push the button and the anger is
there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Reaction means that you have no conscious body developed, so you go
on reacting. Really, when you go on reacting, those reactions cannot be
said to be actions, because actions come only with a conscious body,
developed and mature. Then you ACT; otherwise, you go on reacting.
Someone says this, so you say that; someone does this, so you react in
that way, and everything is predictable.</p><p><br></p><p>We know when the husband comes back home in the evening, he knows
what is going to happen. The whole scene is predictable: what the wife
is going to ask... he knows the question already, and now he is
preparing answers. And the wife knows already what answers he is going
to give. The whole game is predictable, and daily it is repeated. What
are we doing? The husband knows very well that whatsoever he says,
whatsoever he may say, it is not going to be believed; and still, he
will answer in the same way. And the wife knows that whatsoever and
howsoever she may ask, he is going to give the deceptive answer, but
still she goes on asking.</p><p><br></p><p>Is there a dialogue? Impossible. There is just a deceptive game that
both are playing. And this continues for their whole lives. People go on
reacting in the same old routine way. Why? If I know that if I ask THIS
question, THAT answer is to be given; and if I am conscious, there is no
need to ask. The whole thing is just absurd; there is no need to ask.
And I have asked many times, and many times I have been frustrated – and
– and again the same thing. Really, we are not conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment the husband enters the house, the question comes out – it
is not the wife who is asking it – it is just mechanical. The question
comes out, and the moment there is a question, the answer is
manipulated.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever done anything as a conscious agent, as a conscious
action? No. If you have done, then you must have become aware of a
different thing than the mind. The awareness of mind, the consciousness
of the thought process, this standing outside the mind – beyond, just as
an onlooker, an observer – is the fourth body. The third body is
constituted of thoughts; the fourth body is constituted of
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth body is known as the bliss body. This is the last, the
innermost body – but still the body. When the fourth body is purified,
when the fourth body becomes just a transparency, the fifth is realized,
because the fourth becomes so transparent then the fifth is felt
directly. That’s why, when you are in deep meditation you don’t feel
meditation, you feel bliss. When you are deep in meditation, when you
are deep in awareness, you don’t feel awareness, you feel bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>When you begin to feel bliss, that means now you have begun to be
aware. Awareness creates the situation in which bliss is felt.</p><p>Awareness creates the transparency of the fourth body, and the fifth
is seen. The fourth becomes so transparent, that not only you can SEE
through it, you can PASS through it without any resistance – it is just
a door, it is just an opening. This fifth body is the bliss-body. This
bliss is already there. It is</p><p><br></p><p>not to be found somewhere else, it is not to be achieved; it is there
only to be discovered. And you discover it by purifying the fourth
body.</p><p><br></p><p>But this, too, is just a body and has to be transcended; bliss also
has to be transcended. One has to go beyond, because if your cannot go
beyond bliss, you are still off the center. Because bliss is still an
experience, and the experiencer is still beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever you can feel will belong to some body, this or that.
All experiences belong to these five bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>And when there is no experience, only the experiencer remains. When
there is no known object, only the knower remains.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is nothing to be witnessed, but only the witness is, then
you are centered in yourself – then you ARE; otherwise, you belong to
this body or that.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not a body.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the original nature.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the existential source of all being.</p><p><br></p><p>Two or three things more. When you transcend the bliss-body, you
transcend individuality also. When you transcend the bliss-body, you
transcend life and death also, because life and death are phenomena
which exist only in the bodies, and in relation to the bodies. Where
there is no body, you cannot die and you cannot be reborn. So once one
becomes aware of the no-body existence of the center, then there is no
death and no life – then you are existence itself. Then there is no
individuality, then you are not, simply the being is. All form and all
name is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the method to purify the fourth.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what to do with the fifth... how to transcend it? How to
transcend bliss itself? It is difficult to understand because we don’t
know bliss at all, so how to transcend it is irrelevant. First one has
to know, and the moment you know you will know the key to transcend
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The key is known very easily because this is the last body. With
every body it is difficult, because again you face another body. So you
transcend one body, but again you are rooted in another. When you reach
the bliss body, the next behind, then behind the bliss body – for the
first time – there is no body now. Now you are near the very center of
existence. And it has a gravitation of its own: that gravitation is
known as grace.</p><p><br></p><p>You throw something, and gravitation pulls it down, mm? – the earth
pulls it down. But beyond two hundred miles above the earth, around
earth, gravitation cannot work. So the moment a spaceship passes the
two-hundred-miles’ barrier, the earth cannot pull it down. This is the
boundary of earth’s pull – two hundred miles.</p><p><br></p><p>The bliss body is just the boundary of the no-body existence. And
when you are in the bliss body, you are in the pull. Now a new
gravitation begins to work; that gravitation is known as grace. That’s
why</p><p><br></p><p>those who achieve the state beyond all bodies say, “This is not by
our effort that we have reached it; it is by God and His grace.”</p><p><br></p><p>Really, with the fifth, nothing is to be done anyway. You have only
to reach to the fifth – that reaching itself is the doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Reach the fifth, and you will be pulled.</p><p><br></p><p>The reaching itself is anyway transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

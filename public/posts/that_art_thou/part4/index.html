Knowledge, knowing is possible in two ways: mediate and immediate. Mediate knowledge means knowledge through some means, not direct – indirect. Senses are the means, the windows through which we know the extension beyond us. But the knowledge gained is indirect; it is not a face-to-face encounter, the mediator is in between. The senses are mediators, and when senses inform us of something, it is not a simple information, it is an interpretation also. The senses are not just passive receptors; they are positive interpreters also; they impose something, they add something to the information.\nSo whenever anything is reported by the senses to the consciousness, it is not a passive receptivity; the senses have added something to it, they have interpreted it, they have imposed something on it.\nThis imposition creates an illusory world around every consciousness, and everyone begins to live in a world of his own. This world, the Eastern esoteric mind says, is the MAYA, the illusion. It is not the real, the objective, that-which-is: it is something that you have created.\nEveryone is within his own world, and there are as many worlds as there are minds. So whenever two persons are near, two worlds are in collision. And otherwise is not possible, because you have not known the objective as it is.\nThe second dimension, the alternative dimension to know the world as it is, is not through senses, but through transcendence of the senses. And human consciousness can be in a direct encounter: the senses are just dropped; and still, knowing happens. That knowing is about the truth, because there has been no mediator. Now you have known directly. To know the truth through the senses is maya; to know the truth immediately, directly, face to face, is BRAHMAN. That which we know remains the same, but the KNOWER changes. If he is using senses, then he creates an illusory perception; if he is not using the senses, then he is face to face with the reality.\nMeditation is the path of how to drop the senses, how to drop the windows and just to be in reality without anyone in between. The rishi says that this contact with the world through the senses is the first state of consciousness, the awake state of mind, JAGRUT. When you are in contact with the world through the senses, this is jagrut – the awake state of the mind.\nDreaming is the second state, deeper than the state we call the awake. Dreaming is a substitute state, secondary, but deeper. Whatsoever has been left unfulfilled in the state when you were awake, has to be completed. Mind has a tendency to complete things. If you leave something incomplete, then you will create a dream to complete it. The mind tends to complete a thing. You must complete it; otherwise, there is something restless inside.\nYou have seen a beautiful figure, but you couldn’t look at it as you liked, as much you liked. Now a lingering incompletion will continue inside. You can suppress it when you are awake – you are occupied in many other things, and the suppression is possible – but when you go to sleep, the incomplete link unfolds a dream and completes the thing.\nThis state of dreaming, the rishi says, means without the instrumentality of your senses. The senses are closed – they are not aware of the world beyond you; now you are within your cells, within your body, but still you can create you own worlds. This creation of your own worlds in dreams becomes possible because your mind is a conditioning of everything you have known, you have felt; everything has been accumulated in it. It is an accumulation, not only of this life, but of all the lives one has lived; and not only of human lives, of animal lives also; and not only of animal lives, but of vegetable lives also.\nSo in a dream you can become a tree; in a dream you can become a lion. Sometime you have been a tree: that memory is still there – it can unfold. This unfolding of past memories, of past lives, means only that you have never lived totally – always partially. You have not loved totally, you have not been angry totally, you have not been ANYTHING totally. Everything is incomplete. So many things incomplete inside, create the situation in which dreaming happens. The moment one begins to live totally, everything is completed, dreaming ceases.\nA christ, a buddha, will not dream, because he has not left anything incomplete. A Jesus says this moment is enough – live it totally. Do not think of the other moment that is to come; do not think of the other moment that has gone. That which has gone is no more, and that which has not come yet, has not come yet. Both are non-existential.\nThis moment, this very moment, this passive moment is the only existential time. Live in it! And leave all else aside. Be totally in it, then there will be no dreaming, then everything is complete. And by the night, when you are dropping into sleep, nothing is incomplete and needs to be completed. And when dreaming ceases, mind becomes more aware.\nThis is the second state: dreaming. When dreaming ceases you become more awake; and when there is no dreaming in the night, in the morning when you are awake, you have more innocent eyes, more fresh, more alive. In your eyes there is no dust, there is no smoke; the flame is clear without the smoke. Dreaming creates a smoke around your eyes.\nAnd one who has been dreaming in the night, really goes on dreaming in the day also. Deep down there is always a continuous dream film. You are hearing me: just close your eyes and look inside and there is a dream unfolding.\nYou are too occupied outside, that’s why you cannot become attentive to your inside dreaming; but the dreaming continues.\nLook at the sky; there are no stars now. Where have they gone? They cannot go anywhere; they are where they have been in the night, but only because of the sun, we cannot see them. Our eyes are so occupied with the sun, they cannot penetrate through to them. They are still there. If you can go down into a deep well, even in the day, you can look at the stars, because then there is a gap of darkness and again stars appear.\nJust like this, you are continuously dreaming. But when you are occupied in the outside world, the dreaming continues inside without your being attentive to it. The moment you are not occupied, relaxed, you become again aware of the dreaming. This is a constant state – in fact, continuous. And this dreaming is more indicative about your mind than whatsoever we call being awake, because it is less inhibited, less suppressed, more naked and therefore more true.\nSo, if your dreaming can be known, if your dream can be known, much is known about you. You cannot deceive – in dreams, at least. They are still not a part of your will, they are not voluntary. You are not the controller; that’s why they are so wild, so animal-like. This second stage must be penetrated, must be transcended. Only then we can come to the third – still deeper, the deep sleep, the dreamless sleep.\nThe more you go deep inside, the nearer you are to existence. The deeper you go to the center, the nearer you are to the center of the universe. These three are concentric circles around the center: awake, dreaming and deep sleep. These are three concentric circles. If you transcend all these three, then suddenly you are face to face with your own center. Then you are centered in it. That centering is all.\nThat centering is to achieve the deathless.\nThat centering is to be deep inside the heart of the universe. That centering is divine realization.\nDreaming has to cease, one must cease dreaming. Dreaming has to be transcended – dreaming is the barrier. A dreaming mind can never know the truth; a dreaming mind is bound to live in illusory worlds. Dreaming is the problem, and if dreaming stopsAnd it stops when ambition stops, it stops\nwhen desiring stops, it stops when one begins to live moment to moment, just here and now. If you can remember two words, “here” and “now,” dreaming stops. Be here and now, and there can be no dreaming, because dreaming is always from the past and for the future. It originates in the past; it spreads into the future.\nDreaming can never be in the present. To be in the present and to be in a dream is impossible; they never meet. So if one is awake, aware, attentive of the time that is just here and now, dreaming stops. And when dreaming withers away, you can become aware, really aware; you can really become awake. And when you are awake, this awareness can penetrate the third state of consciousness: dreamless sleep. Really, in no language other than Hindi, is there a word for it – SUSHUPTI. In no language is there a word for it – sushupti.\nSleep is not sushupti – that’s why we have to add DREAMLESS sleep. It is not just sleep, it is non- dreaming sleep – without any ripple of the dream, with no waves of the dream. The ocean is totally silent, not even a dream is there to disturb. Then you are in sushupti – the third state, dreamless sleep, the non-dreaming sleep. But you can never become aware of it unless dreaming ceases.\nThe waves must cease; only then can you become aware of the ocean; otherwise, you are always aware of the waves. Waves are on the surface, so when you see, you see the waves, not the ocean. The waves must stop totally. Only then, for the first time, do you become aware of the ocean, the waveless ocean – the dreamless sleep. And if one can become aware of dreamless sleep, one transcends sleep. One transcends sleep only when one becomes aware of it. And then you are turiya, the fourth; then you have passed all the three.\nThis fourth is the being; this fourth is the search. For this fourth effort is needed. And one may go on continuously dreaming and dreaming and dreaming – one can never achieve this fourth state through dreaming. That’s why there is so much insistence on non-desiring, non-ambition. The buddhas go on saying, “Do not desire,” because if you desire then dreaming cannot cease. The buddhas go on saying, “Do not be attached,” because if you are attached the dreaming cannot cease. Do not be ambitious, do not long for any becoming, do not think in terms of the future; otherwise, dreaming cannot cease. And unless dreaming ceases you will never be. You CAN never be! You will always be a becoming, just a becoming: “a” changing into “b,” “b” changing into “c,” “c” changing into “d” – and always the longing for the far off. And then you go on running, and you never reach; then you go on becoming this and that and you are never a being.\nThe being is here and now.\nDrop dreaming and you are there where you have really been always, but you were never aware. All meditation techniques are just antidream efforts, just dream-negating devices.\nThe New Morning Meditation – Dynamic Meditation\nThree steps are to be followed. They should be followed as vigorously as possible. One has to put everything at stake, totally – nothing less will do.\nThe first step is fast breathing. Breathe as fast as possible, because we are using breathing as a hammer. It is to be a hammering inside for the coiled energy to be uncoiled. So use it as a hammer for the inner serpent, to awaken it.\nSo do not withhold; give in completely. For ten minutes I will go on encouraging you to make any effort possible. Whatsoever you can do, do it at your peak, your climax.\nIn the second step you have to be in a catharsis. Dance, jump, cry, laugh – whatsoever happens to you, but do something. Movement is necessary – whatsoever is inside must be thrown outside. This catharsis leads to a purity, to a very deep cleansing.\nIn the third step you have to use “hoo!” So go on crying, “hoo! hoo! hoo!” – this too is to be used as a hammer. This mantra, “hoo,” goes deep down to the MULADHAR, to the sex center, and hammers the energy to rise upwards.\nAfter thirty minutes, the fourth step – we will be lying, just as if dead, and waiting for the divine to descend.\nMake a space around you so you can be just totally mad. Make space around you. Don’t be in a group, don’t be in a crowd – just spread out.\nNow close your eyes with the blindfold.\nMake space. Look around and see, because you will be jumping and dancing and going completely mad.\nNow we should begin. Close your eyes.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2383","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/that_art_thou/>That Art Thou</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Sarvasar Upanishad</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2383 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/That_Art_Thou/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND OTHER GODS, AND THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THESE FOURTEEN: MIND,
INTELLECT, MIND STUFF, EGO, AND THE TEN SENSE ORGANS – BECOMES SENSITIVE
TO SOUND, TOUCH AND SUCH OTHER GROSS OBJECTS, IS CALLED THE WAKING
STATE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE LIVING BEING, ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFULFILLED DESIRES OF THE
WAKING STATE, BECOMES SENSITIVE TO SOUND, TOUCH AND SUCH OTHER GROSS
OBJECTS – EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE LATTER – IT IS CALLED THE DREAMING
STATE OF THE SELF OR SOUL.</p><p><br></p><p>The Eastern mind divides consciousness into four states: one is when
we are awake, or the first; the second is dreaming; the third is deep
sleep, dreamless; and the fourth is beyond all the three, the TURIYA,
the fourth.</p><p><br></p><p>What is this which we call the awake state of consciousness?
Knowledge, knowing is possible in two ways: mediate and immediate.
Mediate knowledge means knowledge through some means, not direct –
indirect. Senses are the means, the windows through which we know the
extension beyond us. But the knowledge gained is indirect; it is not a
face-to-face encounter, the mediator is in between. The senses are
mediators, and when senses inform us of something, it is not a simple
information, it is an interpretation also. The senses are not just
passive receptors; they are positive interpreters also; they impose
something, they add something to the information.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever anything is reported by the senses to the consciousness,
it is not a passive receptivity; the senses have added something to it,
they have interpreted it, they have imposed something on it.</p><p><br></p><p>This imposition creates an illusory world around every consciousness,
and everyone begins to live in a world of his own. This world, the
Eastern esoteric mind says, is the MAYA, the illusion. It is not the
real, the objective, that-which-is: it is something that you have
created.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone is within his own world, and there are as many worlds as
there are minds. So whenever two persons are near, two worlds are in
collision. And otherwise is not possible, because you have not known the
objective as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>The second dimension, the alternative dimension to know the world as
it is, is not through senses, but through transcendence of the senses.
And human consciousness can be in a direct encounter: the senses are
just dropped; and still, knowing happens. That knowing is about the
truth, because there has been no mediator. Now you have known directly.
To know the truth through the senses is maya; to know the truth
immediately, directly, face to face, is BRAHMAN. That which we know
remains the same, but the KNOWER changes. If he is using senses, then he
creates an illusory perception; if he is not using the senses, then he
is face to face with the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the path of how to drop the senses, how to drop the
windows and just to be in reality without anyone in between. The rishi
says that this contact with the world through the senses is the first
state of consciousness, the awake state of mind, JAGRUT. When you are in
contact with the world through the senses, this is jagrut – the awake
state of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming is the second state, deeper than the state we call the
awake. Dreaming is a substitute state, secondary, but deeper. Whatsoever
has been left unfulfilled in the state when you were awake, has to be
completed. Mind has a tendency to complete things. If you leave
something incomplete, then you will create a dream to complete it. The
mind tends to complete a thing. You must complete it; otherwise, there
is something restless inside.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen a beautiful figure, but you couldn’t look at it as you
liked, as much you liked. Now a lingering incompletion will continue
inside. You can suppress it when you are awake – you are occupied in
many other things, and the suppression is possible – but when you go to
sleep, the incomplete link unfolds a dream and completes the thing.</p><p><br></p><p>This state of dreaming, the rishi says, means without the
instrumentality of your senses. The senses are closed – they are not
aware of the world beyond you; now you are within your cells, within
your body, but still you can create you own worlds. This creation of
your own worlds in dreams becomes possible because your mind is a
conditioning of everything you have known, you have felt; everything has
been accumulated in it. It is an accumulation, not only of this life,
but of all the lives one has lived; and not only of human lives, of
animal lives also; and not only of animal lives, but of vegetable lives
also.</p><p><br></p><p>So in a dream you can become a tree; in a dream you can become a
lion. Sometime you have been a tree: that memory is still there – it can
unfold. This unfolding of past memories, of past lives, means only that
you have never lived totally – always partially. You have not loved
totally, you have not been angry totally, you have not been ANYTHING
totally. Everything is incomplete. So many things incomplete inside,
create the situation in which dreaming happens. The moment one begins to
live totally, everything is completed, dreaming ceases.</p><p><br></p><p>A christ, a buddha, will not dream, because he has not left anything
incomplete. A Jesus says this moment is enough – live it totally. Do not
think of the other moment that is to come; do not think of the other
moment that has gone. That which has gone is no more, and that which has
not come yet, has not come yet. Both are non-existential.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment, this very moment, this passive moment is the only
existential time. Live in it! And leave all else aside. Be totally in
it, then there will be no dreaming, then everything is complete. And by
the night, when you are dropping into sleep, nothing is incomplete and
needs to be completed. And when dreaming ceases, mind becomes more
aware.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the second state: dreaming. When dreaming ceases you become
more awake; and when there is no dreaming in the night, in the morning
when you are awake, you have more innocent eyes, more fresh, more alive.
In your eyes there is no dust, there is no smoke; the flame is clear
without the smoke. Dreaming creates a smoke around your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And one who has been dreaming in the night, really goes on dreaming
in the day also. Deep down there is always a continuous dream film. You
are hearing me: just close your eyes and look inside and there is a
dream unfolding.</p><p><br></p><p>You are too occupied outside, that’s why you cannot become attentive
to your inside dreaming; but the dreaming continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the sky; there are no stars now. Where have they gone? They
cannot go anywhere; they are where they have been in the night, but only
because of the sun, we cannot see them. Our eyes are so occupied with
the sun, they cannot penetrate through to them. They are still there. If
you can go down into a deep well, even in the day, you can look at the
stars, because then there is a gap of darkness and again stars
appear.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like this, you are continuously dreaming. But when you are
occupied in the outside world, the dreaming continues inside without
your being attentive to it. The moment you are not occupied, relaxed,
you become again aware of the dreaming. This is a constant state – in
fact, continuous. And this dreaming is more indicative about your mind
than whatsoever we call being awake, because it is less inhibited, less
suppressed, more naked and therefore more true.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if your dreaming can be known, if your dream can be known, much
is known about you. You cannot deceive – in dreams, at least. They are
still not a part of your will, they are not voluntary. You are not the
controller; that’s why they are so wild, so animal-like. This second
stage must be penetrated, must be transcended. Only then we can come to
the third – still deeper, the deep sleep, the dreamless sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>The more you go deep inside, the nearer you are to existence. The
deeper you go to the center, the nearer you are to the center of the
universe. These three are concentric circles around the center: awake,
dreaming and deep sleep. These are three concentric circles. If you
transcend all these three, then suddenly you are face to face with your
own center. Then you are centered in it. That centering is all.</p><p><br></p><p>That centering is to achieve the deathless.</p><p><br></p><p>That centering is to be deep inside the heart of the universe. That
centering is divine realization.</p><p>Dreaming has to cease, one must cease dreaming. Dreaming has to be
transcended – dreaming is the barrier. A dreaming mind can never know
the truth; a dreaming mind is bound to live in illusory worlds. Dreaming
is the problem, and if dreaming stops<span class=s4></span>And it
stops when ambition stops, it stops</p><p>when desiring stops, it stops when one begins to live moment to
moment, just here and now. If you can remember two words, “here” and
“now,” dreaming stops. Be here and now, and there can be no dreaming,
because dreaming is always from the past and for the future. It
originates in the past; it spreads into the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming can never be in the present. To be in the present and to be
in a dream is impossible; they never meet. So if one is awake, aware,
attentive of the time that is just here and now, dreaming stops. And
when dreaming withers away, you can become aware, really aware; you can
really become awake. And when you are awake, this awareness can
penetrate the third state of consciousness: dreamless sleep. Really, in
no language other than Hindi, is there a word for it – SUSHUPTI. In no
language is there a word for it – sushupti.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep is not sushupti – that’s why we have to add DREAMLESS sleep. It
is not just sleep, it is non- dreaming sleep – without any ripple of the
dream, with no waves of the dream. The ocean is totally silent, not even
a dream is there to disturb. Then you are in sushupti – the third state,
dreamless sleep, the non-dreaming sleep. But you can never become aware
of it unless dreaming ceases.</p><p><br></p><p>The waves must cease; only then can you become aware of the ocean;
otherwise, you are always aware of the waves. Waves are on the surface,
so when you see, you see the waves, not the ocean. The waves must stop
totally. Only then, for the first time, do you become aware of the
ocean, the waveless ocean – the dreamless sleep. And if one can become
aware of dreamless sleep, one transcends sleep. One transcends sleep
only when one becomes aware of it. And then you are turiya, the fourth;
then you have passed all the three.</p><p><br></p><p>This fourth is the being; this fourth is the search. For this fourth
effort is needed. And one may go on continuously dreaming and dreaming
and dreaming – one can never achieve this fourth state through dreaming.
That’s why there is so much insistence on non-desiring, non-ambition.
The buddhas go on saying, “Do not desire,” because if you desire then
dreaming cannot cease. The buddhas go on saying, “Do not be attached,”
because if you are attached the dreaming cannot cease. Do not be
ambitious, do not long for any becoming, do not think in terms of the
future; otherwise, dreaming cannot cease. And unless dreaming ceases you
will never be. You CAN never be! You will always be a becoming, just a
becoming: “a” changing into “b,” “b” changing into “c,” “c” changing
into “d” – and always the longing for the far off. And then you go on
running, and you never reach; then you go on becoming this and that and
you are never a being.</p><p><br></p><p>The being is here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop dreaming and you are there where you have really been always,
but you were never aware. All meditation techniques are just antidream
efforts, just dream-negating devices.</p><p><br></p><p>The New Morning Meditation – Dynamic Meditation</p><p><br></p><p>Three steps are to be followed. They should be followed as vigorously
as possible. One has to put everything at stake, totally – nothing less
will do.</p><p><br></p><p>The first step is fast breathing. Breathe as fast as possible,
because we are using breathing as a hammer. It is to be a hammering
inside for the coiled energy to be uncoiled. So use it as a hammer for
the inner serpent, to awaken it.</p><p><br></p><p>So do not withhold; give in completely. For ten minutes I will go on
encouraging you to make any effort possible. Whatsoever you can do, do
it at your peak, your climax.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second step you have to be in a catharsis. Dance, jump, cry,
laugh – whatsoever happens to you, but do something. Movement is
necessary – whatsoever is inside must be thrown outside. This catharsis
leads to a purity, to a very deep cleansing.</p><p><br></p><p>In the third step you have to use “hoo!” So go on crying, “hoo! hoo!
hoo!” – this too is to be used as a hammer. This mantra, “hoo,” goes
deep down to the MULADHAR, to the sex center, and hammers the energy to
rise upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>After thirty minutes, the fourth step – we will be lying, just as if
dead, and waiting for the divine to descend.</p><p><br></p><p>Make a space around you so you can be just totally mad. Make space
around you. Don’t be in a group, don’t be in a crowd – just spread
out.</p><p><br></p><p>Now close your eyes with the blindfold.</p><p><br></p><p>Make space. Look around and see, because you will be jumping and
dancing and going completely mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we should begin. Close your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

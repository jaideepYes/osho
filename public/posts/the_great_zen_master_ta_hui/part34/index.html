HOW WONDERFUL!\" -- and with great reverence, HE BOWED DOWN AND WITHDREW.\nNo other question ... everything is solved. He has been kicked out of the nest, now his wings are open in the sky. Now he can fly across the sun. Now there are no more any boundaries. And he remembered the event his whole life, even when he became a great respected master, saying \"The greatest thing in my life was the kick that Ma Tsu gave me. I have not stopped laughing since then.\"\nSomething that is not visible to the eyes must have happened in that moment. As Ma Tsu reached and knocked him, perhaps -- most probably -- he may have knocked him out of his body, and Shui Lao must have witnessed the whole scene, standing outside his own body. The first experience of being outside your own body is one of the most exquisite, sweet, marvelous experiences: you are released.\nYour body is your prison. Your mind is your prison.\nTa Hui has named the sutra rightly as THE RELEASE.\nGet ready and be prepared. It is a totally different world from the days of Ma Tsu, but I would like to make that beautiful time and those beautiful incidents contemporary again. But it all depends on you. If you are gradually dropping all your garbage, becoming more alert, not forgetting for a single moment -- walking, sitting, working, lying down, a constant undercurrent of remembrance -- then the day is not far away when I will start knocking people down. There is no necessity to actually knock somebody down, because between me and Ma Tsu much time has passed, and I have got more refined methods! He is, in a way, primitive.\nI do my own kind of kicking and knocking, so don't wait for me to actually hit you on your chest. There is no need ... I have developed more subtle methods -- but you have to be ready anyway.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n32\nDesirelessness\n17 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, RELEASE\nONE DAY KU SHAN APPROACHED HSUEH FENG. FENG KNEW HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIPE, SO HE SUDDENLY GOT UP, HELD HIM TIGHT, AND SAID, \"WHAT IS IT?\" OPENING UP, KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED -- HE EVEN FORGOT HIS COMPREHENDING MIND AND JUST RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED, NOTHING MORE. FENG SAID, \"WILL YOU EXPRESS SOME PRINCIPLE?\"\nHAVING LEFT THE FIFTH PATRIARCH'S PLACE, HUI NENG TRAVELED SOUTH FOR TWO MONTHS, AND HAD REACHED THE TA YU RANGE. HE WAS PURSUED BY THE MONK HUI MING, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY A GENERAL, ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED MEN, WHO WANTED TO SEIZE THE ROBE AND BOWL (EMBLEMATIC OF SUCCESSION TO THE PATRIARCHS). MING WAS THE FIRST TO OVERTAKE HIM. THE SIXTH PATRIARCH THREW DOWN THE ROBE AND BOWL ON A ROCK AND SAID, \"THIS ROBE SIGNIFIES FAITH: HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY FORCE?\" MING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THEM. AT THAT POINT HE SAID, \"I HAVE COME FOR THE DHARMA, NOT FOR THE ROBE.\" THE PATRIARCH SAID, \"SINCE YOU'VE COME FOR THE DHARMA, YOU SHOULD PUT TO REST ALL YOUR MOTIVATIONS, AND DON'T GIVE RISE TO A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND I WILL EXPLAIN FOR YOU.\" AFTER A SILENCE, HE SAID, \"WITHOUT THINKING OF GOOD, AND WITHOUT THINKING OF EVIL, AT JUST SUCH A TIME, WHICH IS YOUR ORIGINAL FACE?\" AT THESE WORDS HUI MING WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE ALSO ASKED, \"BESIDES THE INTIMATE WORDS AND MEANING THAT STRUCK HOME OF A MOMENT AGO, IS THERE ANY FURTHER INTIMATE MESSAGE?\" THE PATRIARCH SAID, \"IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT WOULDN'T BE INTIMATE. IF YOU TURN AROUND AND REFLECT, WHAT'S INTIMATE IS IN YOU.\" MING SAID, \"THOUGH I WAS AT HUANG MEI, I NEVER REALLY HAD INSIGHT INTO MY OWN FACE. NOW, ENCOUNTERING YOUR INSTRUCTION, I AM LIKE A MAN DRINKING WATER WHO KNOWS FOR HIMSELF WHETHER IT'S COLD OR WARM.\"\n\"JUST KNOW HOW TO BE A BUDDHA: DON'T WORRY THAT A BUDDHA WON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK.\" SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE PATH, SINCE THEY ARE FULL THEMSELVES, HAVE PUT FORTH THEIR OWN SURPLUS TO RESPOND TO POTENTIALS AND RECEIVE BEINGS. THEY ARE LIKE A BRIGHT MIRROR ON ITS STAND, LIKE A BRIGHT JEWEL IN THE PALM OF THE HAND; WHEN AN OUTSIDER COMES, AN OUTSIDER APPEARS, AND WHEN A NATIVE COMES, A NATIVE APPEARS. AND IT'S NOT\nINTENTIONAL: IF IT WERE INTENTIONAL, THEN THERE WOULD BE A REAL DOCTRINE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE. YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR.\nTa Hui still continues with the meaning of release. The question is so fundamental that however often it has to be repeated it will never be said completely.\nThere are things which you can only indicate, and the indication is always capable of being misunderstood -- most probably it will be misunderstood -- because the indication is only an arrow. Unless you know to look in that direction, unless you are aware that the arrow is pointing to something beyond itself, there is every possibility you may cling to the arrow itself.\nBecause of this complexity, things which were said for the freedom of man have become his imprisonment. What are your churches, your temples and your synagogues except prisons of your soul? What are your holy scriptures? They were meant to be arrows pointing beyond words, but even the so-called learned people cling to the words and forget completely that those words are only arrows; they are only pointing towards something which is wordless -- something which they cannot say, but they can point to. But they are only fingers pointing to the moon.\nHence it has to be again and again hammered on your conditioned mind from different aspects what is the meaning of release. Ta Hui gives you a few examples of when the release did happen. And it happened absolutely irrationally; there was no necessity for it to happen -- except that the disciple was ripe and the master's insight was so clear that he did not miss the moment. He struck, he slapped, he shouted, he did something, and suddenly there was an opening -- the clouds disappeared.\nONE DAY, KU SHAN APPROACHED HSUEH FENG. FENG KNEW HIS\nCIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIPE. When a woman is pregnant she knows she is pregnant, and when the child is nine months old the mother knows that the time has come to receive a new guest in the world. There are no indications from the child, but the very ripening has its own impact. In the East when the mango groves are full of ripe mangos, passing by the road, suddenly you are aware that the whole air is full of the sweetness of the mangos.\nScientists have been working for almost half a century on bees, because they suspect that bees know a certain kind of language. It is very exciting to find out what kind of language bees use; it will open up a tremendously new area of communication. One bee goes miles in a certain direction for no reason at all -- but she finds the place where flowers are blossoming, and she goes directly to those flowers, as if she is following a map.\nOnce she has found the flowers she returns, and she dances in a certain way before the whole crowd of bees who are watching the dance. The dance has all the indications -- in which direction, how far away you will find the flowers -- and suddenly thousands of bees start moving towards that direction, without any failure, without going in any other direction.\nIn the dance of the bee there are indications which have not yet been deciphered. For half a century work has been done, but it is very difficult because we know a language, but we don't know how a dance ... and the same kind of dance with small differences can give different meanings. If there are no ripe flowers the dance will be almost the same, but with such a slight difference that only bees can decipher it; scientists have not been able ... It is certain that there\nis a difference because no bee moves in that direction; they will wait, and tomorrow again the bee will go.\nCertain bees are the messenger bees, the postmen. Bees have a hierarchy; there are soldiers, there are postmen, there are laborers, and there is a queen, and they all do different kinds of work. If there is danger ... the same dance but with a slight difference.\nBetween the master and the disciple something happens so that when the disciple is ripe, he knows he is ripe and his master knows he is ripe. This is the time to allow him a breakthrough. There are thousands of tremendously beautiful incidents. This one is so simple but so pregnant.\nFENG KNEW HIS CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are aware, how can you miss knowing it? Feng knew Kushan was ripe ... SO HE SUDDENLY GOT UP, HELD HIM TIGHT, AND SAID, \"WHAT IS IT?\" And there was an opening: OPENING UP, KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED. Nothing special happened; just the master knew, the disciple knew, that something had come to a climax. And the master got hold of the disciple tightly and said, \"What is it?\" It is not a question to be answered; it is a question that opens up a new dimension in the disciple.\nOPENING UP, KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED. HE EVEN FORGOT\nHIS COMPREHENDING MIND. The experience was so great, the splendor was so overwhelming, that he even forgot to show his reverence to the master, or to say some right words to express his gratitude. HE JUST RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED. This waving of the hand is a mute expression that \"I have got it! You got me right in the moment -- it has happened!\"\nHE JUST RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED, NOTHING MORE. FENG SAID, \"WILL\nYOU EXPRESS SOME PRINCIPLE?\" But there is absolute silence, the story has ended. The master's question -- \"You have waved your hand, that's right. But will you express some principle that you have understood, experienced?\" -- the disciple has not answered. There is no answer! He must have stood before the master, being himself the answer -- his silence, his joy, his sudden opening ... His crazy gesture of waving the hand simply indicates that it is beyond the mind and beyond his comprehension ... what principle? -- there is only silence and no principle.\nIt is something rare; only a Zen story can end in such a way. The master asks the question, and the disciple remains silent -- that is the answer. If he had spoken he would have got a good hit, because his speaking would have shown that he had missed, that he could not manage to open himself entirely, that he had still remained in the mind.\nBut his silence shows that now there is no question, no answer; there is no principle, no philosophy. There is no you, no me, but only a total serenity, an eternal silence which has never been disturbed.\nThese are not stories; stories don't end in such a way. This is an actual incident. The silence is being understood by the master. Nothing is said, but everything is heard.\nA second incident ... just giving you different aspects, from different doors. HAVING LEFT THE FIFTH PATRIARCH'S PLACE, HUI NENG TRAVELED SOUTH FOR TWO MONTHS, AND HAD REACHED THE TA YU RANGE. HE WAS PURSUED BY THE MONK HUI MING, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY A GENERAL, ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED MEN, WHO WANTED TO SEIZE THE ROBE AND THE BOWL\n(EMBLEMATIC OF SUCCESSION TO THE PATRIARCHS). In Zen, every patriarch gives his robe and his bowl to his successor, and naturally there is great competition and human frailties, jealousies ...\nThis man, Hui Ming, was far more learned, in every way far more cultured. He had renounced the great post of general, and had become a disciple; he had practiced for a long time. But the master chose a very strange man, Hui Neng, to be his successor. In his monastery there were at least twelve thousand monks, and not a single one would have thought that Hui Neng was going to become the successor.\nHui Neng's only accomplishment was that since he had come, twenty years before, he had been cleaning the rice for the twelve thousand monks from the early morning till late at night. For twenty years he had not done anything else. He had never been in any of the discourses of the master, he had never read any scripture -- in fact he was illiterate. He was a villager, but a man of tremendous determination.\nThe day he got initiated, Hui Neng asked the master, \"What am I supposed to do?\"\nThe master said, \"Go to the mess, clean rice and never again come back to me\" -- and he never came back again. Twenty years of silently waiting ... because the master had said, \"If it is needed, I will come to you. But you should never again show your face to me. You simply clean the rice from morning till night, then go to sleep; again clean the rice, then go to sleep.\"\nYou can understand, twenty years just cleaning rice and going to sleep, his mind became silent. No meditation was needed. He never went to any discourse -- there was no time. Nobody talked to him because he was thought to be of the lowest category, just a poor villager who knows nothing, and he never asked anything of anybody. People passed by him as if he was not there. He was taken for granted.\nThe day came for the master to leave his body, and he said, \"Before I leave my body I want to choose my successor. The way I want to choose is this: whoever knows the right answer should come in the night and write it on my door; if the answer is right, he will receive my robe and my bowl.\"\nThis ex-general, Hui Ming, was certainly the most important person of the whole following of the master, and everybody thought that he would be the winner. So he went in the night and he wrote on the door, \"No-mind is the answer.\" But he was so afraid of the master -- afraid that if it is found to be wrong he is going to get a good beating -- that he did not sign it. He thought, \"If it is right then I will declare that I have written it; if it is wrong then it is better to keep silent.\"\nIn the morning when the master woke up he said, \"Who is that idiot?\" Hearing this, Hui Ming escaped from the monastery -- somebody may inform the master because a few people had got the idea ... they were looking out for who was going to write. In fact it was public knowledge that it was Hui Ming!\nTwo monks, after taking their food, were just passing by Hui Neng and discussing, saying, \"The master is too hard. The answer seems to be right: \"no-mind\" is the whole philosophy of Gautam Buddha. What more can be said?\" People had completely forgotten that Hui Neng even speaks; for twenty years he had not spoken a single word to anybody. He simply did his work, would go to sleep, wake up, start his work again. That day, listening to those two monks saying that the answer seems to be right and the master is too hard, he laughed. Those two monks stopped and they said, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nHe said, \"Whoever wrote that is an idiot.\" This was exactly what the master had said, \"Who is the idiot who has spoiled my door?\" Those monks could not believe it, but they informed the master that a man of the name of Hui Neng, whom he had sent twenty years before to the mess, had said exactly the same thing: \"Whoever wrote this is an idiot.\"\nThe master said, \"I know. He is the only man ... I was hoping that he would come and write the answer. But I forgot completely that in the first place he is non-ambitious; in the second place he cannot write, he is illiterate; in the third place I had prohibited him: 'Whenever the time comes I will come to you, you have to remain in the work I have given to you. Never show your face.'\"\nIn the middle of the night the master came, woke up Hui Neng, gave him the bowl and his robe and said, \"Now escape, because you are a simple fellow. There is great competition, and there are dangerous people -- that man Hui Ming has been a general, he is a warrior. They will try to snatch away the robe and the bowl, so you simply escape as far away as possible.\"\nHui Neng said, \"But I don't know anything. Moreover, I have not committed any crime. Why should you make me your successor? Why can't I be left to live peacefully? You can find ... so many people are eager, wanting to be the successor, why are you bothering me?\"\nBut the master said, \"These are the reasons why I am bothering you: a man who is not interested at all is the right man. A man who has no ambitions is worthy. A man who can refuse the highest stage in the tradition of Zen of being a patriarch, a master of masters ...\"\nHui Neng still tried to persuade him, \"Just let me clean rice and don't disturb my sleep! I am tired and in the morning I have to start my work again, and just think of twelve thousand monks and their rice ...\"\nThe master said, \"Stop all this! If people become aware that I have chosen you they will kill you. Just take this bowl and this robe and run away, because tomorrow morning I am going to die, and before that I want you to be miles away.\" That's how Hui Neng was chosen to be the successor.\nStrange people ... and strange are their stories, but of tremendous importance. This Hui Neng was followed by Hui Ming, the general, with thousands of people, to catch hold of him and forcibly take away the bowl and the robe so that Hui Ming could declare himself the master. This is the background to the story.\nMing was the first to overtake Hui Neng, and there were many others also following. THE SIXTH PATRIARCH THREW DOWN THE ROBE AND BOWL ON A ROCK AND SAID, \"THIS ROBE SIGNIFIES FAITH: HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY FORCE?\" Faith cannot be\ntaken by force. Faith grows only in the climate of love. Faith is the highest flowering; it cannot be taken away by force.\n\"So this is the robe and this is the bowl. But remember, THIS ROBE SIGNIFIES FAITH, and you are only a general -- you know the ways of force, you don't know the ways of love. HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY FORCE? If you can take it by force, take it.\"\nMING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE\nTHEM. It may seem to be fictitious, but in the deepest experience of my own self I don't think it is fictitious. I have my own explanation of why it happened ... Hui Neng was a man of peace and silence, a man without any desires, and when such a man speaks, he speaks with authority, his words are pure power. And when he said, \"This bowl and this robe represent faith, and faith cannot be taken by force,\" his very statement would have weakened Hui Ming.\nHui Ming knew perfectly well that he does not have faith, he knows only what force is. It must have weakened his whole will. It is not a miracle; it is a simple psychological fact. He tried to pick it up ... but he must have tried knowing perfectly well that he could not pick it up.\nThere is a place near a beautiful river, Narmada, where there was a temple of Shiva. Outside every temple of Shiva is his bodyguard, the bull; the bull sits outside the temple. There is a story that underneath the bull at that particular temple -- it is an ancient temple -- there is a little space which you can pass through ... but only if you have faith.\nI had gone there with a friend who was a professor -- full of doubts, although he was not too fat. When I told him, \"Try to pass through this small space underneath the bull,\" he said, \"I don't see any problem. Because I am not a fat man, I can pass.\"\nI said to him, \"You cannot pass, because unless you have faith ... It is not a question of being fat or being thin; I have seen fat people passing through it, and I have seen thin people getting caught.\"\nHe said, \"It is all nonsense, I will show you.\" But even while he was saying it, deep inside he was trembling. A crowd gathered, which made it even more fearful, and he was caught in the middle. He started shouting -- \"Help me!\"\nI said, \"In questions of faith, nobody can help. Try your logic, try your reason, try your arguments.\" And people were laughing! They were laughing because he was so thin, why has he got caught? He just lost his nerve. He knew perfectly well he had no faith, he had no trust, he was full of doubts -- he is doubt and nothing else. He knew perfectly well in the depths of his heart that he could not pass.\nI had to pull him out -- of course from the back side, \"because,\" I said, \"from the front I cannot, because I cannot go against the rule.\" So I had to pull him by his legs, backwards. He looked very strange.\nHe said, \"I can see that the space is enough, but something inside me simply gave way. I simply lost my nerve.\" I myself went through that small space, and I was at least twice the weight of the professor.\nThere are things which may look like fictions if you don't understand man and his psychology. To me this is not a fiction, this is a historical fact. It must have happened. The words of Hui Neng must have created the atmosphere, the climate, such that Hui Ming lost his willpower. He tried, but he had no force. He suddenly became impotent.\nMING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THEM. AT THAT POINT HE SAID, \"I HAVE COME FOR THE DHARMA, NOT FOR THE ROBE.\" THE PATRIARCH SAID, \"SINCE YOU'VE COME FOR THE DHARMA, YOU SHOULD PUT TO REST ALL YOUR MOTIVATIONS, AND DON'T GIVE RISE TO A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND I WILL EXPLAIN FOR YOU.\" AFTER A SILENCE, HE SAID, \"WITHOUT THINKING OF GOOD, AND WITHOUT THINKING OF EVIL, AT JUST SUCH A TIME, WHICH IS YOUR ORIGINAL FACE?\"\nWhen there is no movement of thought, desire, motivation -- at such a moment you are, in your original purity. And to know this original face is to know all.\nAT THESE WORDS, HUI MING WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE ALSO ASKED, \"BESIDES THE INTIMATE WORDS AND MEANING THAT STRUCK HOME OF A MOMENT AGO, IS THERE ANY FURTHER INTIMATE MESSAGE?\" THE\nPATRIARCH SAID, \"IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT WOULDN'T BE INTIMATE\" --\nbecause words create distance.\nThe intimate is not a communication.\nThe intimate is a transmission from heart to heart ... In silence, in love, in peace.\nNothing is said, nothing is heard, but everything is understood ... that is intimate.\n\"IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT WOULD NOT BE INTIMATE. IF YOU TURN\nAROUND AND REFLECT, WHAT'S INTIMATE IS IN YOU\" -- it is not outside you. You are the most intimate to yourself; nobody can be closer to you than yourself. However close somebody may come to you, that closeness is still a distance. Only you are intimate.\nMING SAID, \"THOUGH I WAS AT HUANG MEI, I NEVER REALLY HAD\nINSIGHT\" -- he recognized that although he had been in the monastery for years studying, disciplining himself, he had never had any real insight -- \"INTO MY OWN FACE. NOW, ENCOUNTERING YOUR INSTRUCTION, I AM LIKE A MAN DRINKING WATER WHO KNOWS FOR HIMSELF WHETHER IT'S COLD OR WARM.\"\n\"JUST KNOW HOW TO BE A BUDDHA: DON'T WORRY THAT A BUDDHA WON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK.\" SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE PATH, SINCE THEY ARE FULL THEMSELVES, HAVE PUT FORTH THEIR OWN SURPLUS TO RESPOND TO POTENTIALS AND RECEIVE BEINGS. THEY ARE LIKE A BRIGHT MIRROR ON ITS STAND, LIKE A BRIGHT JEWEL IN THE PALM OF THE HAND; WHEN AN OUTSIDER COMES, AN OUTSIDER APPEARS, AND WHEN A NATIVE COMES, A NATIVE APPEARS. AND IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL: IF IT WERE INTENTIONAL, THEN THERE WOULD BE A REAL DOCTRINE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE. YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR.\nThese are the two ways ... whether you want to be clear or you want to be clever. However clever you become you will remain ignorant, and you may know nothing, but if you are clear\n-- a mirror without any dust -- you will reflect the very essence of existence.\nThere is a strange story that before Hui Neng died, many years after this incident, he chose Hui Ming to be his successor. What Ming could not get by force, he got by becoming non-ambitious, meditative. When Hui Neng asked him, \"Now the time has come for me to depart and, Hui Ming, you have been so ambitious to be the patriarch, you may have the bowl and the robe which you could not take with all your force. Are you ready now?\", Hui Ming said, \"I am no more interested. There are many others.\"\nHui Neng, the illiterate, became one of the greatest Zen masters, just by his simplicity, just by his innocent ways. He attracted many disciples of great qualities, and he had many followers who could have been chosen as his successor. But first he told Hui Ming, \"You were so desirous; I wanted to give it to you at that very moment, but it was not within my capacity: neither I could give it, nor was it in your capacity to take it. But now I can see you are ripe.\nAnd Hui Ming is reported to have said, \"It is a strange game. When I wanted it I could not have it; now I have not the slightest desire, and you are offering me ...

saying "This is absolutely absurd! I am asking a question and you are
hitting me." But he took the hit in the same way as Mahakashyapa had
taken the lotus flower -- with even more beauty: "HOW EXTRAORDINARY! HOW
WONDERFUL!" -- and with great reverence, HE BOWED DOWN AND WITHDREW.</p><p>No other question ... everything is solved. He has been kicked out of
the nest, now his wings are open in the sky. Now he can fly across the
sun. Now there are no more any boundaries. And he remembered the event
his whole life, even when he became a great respected master, saying
"The greatest thing in my life was the kick that Ma Tsu gave me. I have
not stopped laughing since then."</p><p>Something that is not visible to the eyes must have happened in that
moment. As Ma Tsu reached and knocked him, perhaps -- most probably --
he may have knocked him out of his body, and Shui Lao must have
witnessed the whole scene, standing outside his own body. The first
experience of being outside your own body is one of the most exquisite,
sweet, marvelous experiences: you are released.</p><p>Your body is your prison. Your mind is your prison.</p><p>Ta Hui has named the sutra rightly as THE RELEASE.</p><p>Get ready and be prepared. It is a totally different world from the
days of Ma Tsu, but I would like to make that beautiful time and those
beautiful incidents contemporary again. But it all depends on you. If
you are gradually dropping all your garbage, becoming more alert, not
forgetting for a single moment -- walking, sitting, working, lying down,
a constant undercurrent of remembrance -- then the day is not far away
when I will start knocking people down. There is no necessity to
actually knock somebody down, because between me and Ma Tsu much time
has passed, and I have got more refined methods! He is, in a way,
primitive.</p><p>I do my own kind of kicking and knocking, so don't wait for me to
actually hit you on your chest. There is no need ... I have developed
more subtle methods -- but you have to be ready anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>32</p><p>Desirelessness</p><p>17 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, RELEASE</p><p>ONE DAY KU SHAN APPROACHED HSUEH FENG. FENG KNEW HIS CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE RIPE, SO HE SUDDENLY GOT UP, HELD HIM TIGHT, AND SAID, "WHAT IS
IT?" OPENING UP, KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED -- HE EVEN FORGOT
HIS COMPREHENDING MIND AND JUST RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED, NOTHING MORE.
FENG SAID, "WILL YOU EXPRESS SOME PRINCIPLE?"</p><p>HAVING LEFT THE FIFTH PATRIARCH'S PLACE, HUI NENG TRAVELED SOUTH FOR
TWO MONTHS, AND HAD REACHED THE TA YU RANGE. HE WAS PURSUED BY THE MONK
HUI MING, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY A GENERAL, ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED
MEN, WHO WANTED TO SEIZE THE ROBE AND BOWL (EMBLEMATIC OF SUCCESSION TO
THE PATRIARCHS). MING WAS THE FIRST TO OVERTAKE HIM. THE SIXTH PATRIARCH
THREW DOWN THE ROBE AND BOWL ON A ROCK AND SAID, "THIS ROBE SIGNIFIES
FAITH: HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY FORCE?" MING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND
BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THEM. AT THAT POINT HE SAID, "I HAVE COME
FOR THE DHARMA, NOT FOR THE ROBE." THE PATRIARCH SAID, "SINCE YOU'VE
COME FOR THE DHARMA, YOU SHOULD PUT TO REST ALL YOUR MOTIVATIONS, AND
DON'T GIVE RISE TO A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND I WILL EXPLAIN FOR YOU." AFTER
A SILENCE, HE SAID, "WITHOUT THINKING OF GOOD, AND WITHOUT THINKING OF
EVIL, AT JUST SUCH A TIME, WHICH IS YOUR ORIGINAL FACE?" AT THESE WORDS
HUI MING WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE ALSO ASKED, "BESIDES THE INTIMATE
WORDS AND MEANING THAT STRUCK HOME OF A MOMENT AGO, IS THERE ANY FURTHER
INTIMATE MESSAGE?" THE PATRIARCH SAID, "IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT
WOULDN'T BE INTIMATE. IF YOU TURN AROUND AND REFLECT, WHAT'S INTIMATE IS
IN YOU." MING SAID, "THOUGH I WAS AT HUANG MEI, I NEVER REALLY HAD
INSIGHT INTO MY OWN FACE. NOW, ENCOUNTERING YOUR INSTRUCTION, I AM LIKE
A MAN DRINKING WATER WHO KNOWS FOR HIMSELF WHETHER IT'S COLD OR
WARM."</p><p>"JUST KNOW HOW TO BE A BUDDHA: DON'T WORRY THAT A BUDDHA WON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK." SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE PATH,
SINCE THEY ARE FULL THEMSELVES, HAVE PUT FORTH THEIR OWN SURPLUS TO
RESPOND TO POTENTIALS AND RECEIVE BEINGS. THEY ARE LIKE A BRIGHT MIRROR
ON ITS STAND, LIKE A BRIGHT JEWEL IN THE PALM OF THE HAND; WHEN AN
OUTSIDER COMES, AN OUTSIDER APPEARS, AND WHEN A NATIVE COMES, A NATIVE
APPEARS. AND IT'S NOT</p><p>INTENTIONAL: IF IT WERE INTENTIONAL, THEN THERE WOULD BE A REAL
DOCTRINE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE. YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR.</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui still continues with the meaning of release. The question is
so fundamental that however often it has to be repeated it will never be
said completely.</p><p>There are things which you can only indicate, and the indication is
always capable of being misunderstood -- most probably it will be
misunderstood -- because the indication is only an arrow. Unless you
know to look in that direction, unless you are aware that the arrow is
pointing to something beyond itself, there is every possibility you may
cling to the arrow itself.</p><p>Because of this complexity, things which were said for the freedom of
man have become his imprisonment. What are your churches, your temples
and your synagogues except prisons of your soul? What are your holy
scriptures? They were meant to be arrows pointing beyond words, but even
the so-called learned people cling to the words and forget completely
that those words are only arrows; they are only pointing towards
something which is wordless -- something which they cannot say, but they
can point to. But they are only fingers pointing to the moon.</p><p>Hence it has to be again and again hammered on your conditioned mind
from different aspects what is the meaning of release. Ta Hui gives you
a few examples of when the release did happen. And it happened
absolutely irrationally; there was no necessity for it to happen --
except that the disciple was ripe and the master's insight was so clear
that he did not miss the moment. He struck, he slapped, he shouted, he
did something, and suddenly there was an opening -- the clouds
disappeared.</p><p>ONE DAY, KU SHAN APPROACHED HSUEH FENG. FENG KNEW HIS</p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIPE. When a woman is pregnant she knows she is
pregnant, and when the child is nine months old the mother knows that
the time has come to receive a new guest in the world. There are no
indications from the child, but the very ripening has its own impact. In
the East when the mango groves are full of ripe mangos, passing by the
road, suddenly you are aware that the whole air is full of the sweetness
of the mangos.</p><p>Scientists have been working for almost half a century on bees,
because they suspect that bees know a certain kind of language. It is
very exciting to find out what kind of language bees use; it will open
up a tremendously new area of communication. One bee goes miles in a
certain direction for no reason at all -- but she finds the place where
flowers are blossoming, and she goes directly to those flowers, as if
she is following a map.</p><p>Once she has found the flowers she returns, and she dances in a
certain way before the whole crowd of bees who are watching the dance.
The dance has all the indications -- in which direction, how far away
you will find the flowers -- and suddenly thousands of bees start moving
towards that direction, without any failure, without going in any other
direction.</p><p>In the dance of the bee there are indications which have not yet been
deciphered. For half a century work has been done, but it is very
difficult because we know a language, but we don't know how a dance ...
and the same kind of dance with small differences can give different
meanings. If there are no ripe flowers the dance will be almost the
same, but with such a slight difference that only bees can decipher it;
scientists have not been able ... It is certain that there</p><p>is a difference because no bee moves in that direction; they will
wait, and tomorrow again the bee will go.</p><p>Certain bees are the messenger bees, the postmen. Bees have a
hierarchy; there are soldiers, there are postmen, there are laborers,
and there is a queen, and they all do different kinds of work. If there
is danger ... the same dance but with a slight difference.</p><p>Between the master and the disciple something happens so that when
the disciple is ripe, he knows he is ripe and his master knows he is
ripe. This is the time to allow him a breakthrough. There are thousands
of tremendously beautiful incidents. This one is so simple but so
pregnant.</p><p>FENG KNEW HIS CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are aware, how can you miss
knowing it? Feng knew Kushan was ripe ... SO HE SUDDENLY GOT UP, HELD
HIM TIGHT, AND SAID, "WHAT IS IT?" And there was an opening: OPENING UP,
KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED. Nothing special happened; just the
master knew, the disciple knew, that something had come to a climax. And
the master got hold of the disciple tightly and said, "What is it?" It
is not a question to be answered; it is a question that opens up a new
dimension in the disciple.</p><p>OPENING UP, KU SHAN WAS COMPLETELY ENLIGHTENED. HE EVEN FORGOT</p><p>HIS COMPREHENDING MIND. The experience was so great, the splendor was
so overwhelming, that he even forgot to show his reverence to the
master, or to say some right words to express his gratitude. HE JUST
RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED. This waving of the hand is a mute expression
that "I have got it! You got me right in the moment -- it has
happened!"</p><p>HE JUST RAISED HIS HAND AND WAVED, NOTHING MORE. FENG SAID, "WILL</p><p>YOU EXPRESS SOME PRINCIPLE?" But there is absolute silence, the story
has ended. The master's question -- "You have waved your hand, that's
right. But will you express some principle that you have understood,
experienced?" -- the disciple has not answered. There is no answer! He
must have stood before the master, being himself the answer -- his
silence, his joy, his sudden opening ... His crazy gesture of waving the
hand simply indicates that it is beyond the mind and beyond his
comprehension ... what principle? -- there is only silence and no
principle.</p><p>It is something rare; only a Zen story can end in such a way. The
master asks the question, and the disciple remains silent -- that is the
answer. If he had spoken he would have got a good hit, because his
speaking would have shown that he had missed, that he could not manage
to open himself entirely, that he had still remained in the mind.</p><p>But his silence shows that now there is no question, no answer; there
is no principle, no philosophy. There is no you, no me, but only a total
serenity, an eternal silence which has never been disturbed.</p><p>These are not stories; stories don't end in such a way. This is an
actual incident. The silence is being understood by the master. Nothing
is said, but everything is heard.</p><p>A second incident ... just giving you different aspects, from
different doors. HAVING LEFT THE FIFTH PATRIARCH'S PLACE, HUI NENG
TRAVELED SOUTH FOR TWO MONTHS, AND HAD REACHED THE TA YU RANGE. HE WAS
PURSUED BY THE MONK HUI MING, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY A GENERAL, ACCOMPANIED
BY SEVERAL HUNDRED MEN, WHO WANTED TO SEIZE THE ROBE AND THE BOWL</p><p>(EMBLEMATIC OF SUCCESSION TO THE PATRIARCHS). In Zen, every patriarch
gives his robe and his bowl to his successor, and naturally there is
great competition and human frailties, jealousies ...</p><p>This man, Hui Ming, was far more learned, in every way far more
cultured. He had renounced the great post of general, and had become a
disciple; he had practiced for a long time. But the master chose a very
strange man, Hui Neng, to be his successor. In his monastery there were
at least twelve thousand monks, and not a single one would have thought
that Hui Neng was going to become the successor.</p><p>Hui Neng's only accomplishment was that since he had come, twenty
years before, he had been cleaning the rice for the twelve thousand
monks from the early morning till late at night. For twenty years he had
not done anything else. He had never been in any of the discourses of
the master, he had never read any scripture -- in fact he was
illiterate. He was a villager, but a man of tremendous
determination.</p><p>The day he got initiated, Hui Neng asked the master, "What am I
supposed to do?"</p><p>The master said, "Go to the mess, clean rice and never again come
back to me" -- and he never came back again. Twenty years of silently
waiting ... because the master had said, "If it is needed, I will come
to you. But you should never again show your face to me. You simply
clean the rice from morning till night, then go to sleep; again clean
the rice, then go to sleep."</p><p>You can understand, twenty years just cleaning rice and going to
sleep, his mind became silent. No meditation was needed. He never went
to any discourse -- there was no time. Nobody talked to him because he
was thought to be of the lowest category, just a poor villager who knows
nothing, and he never asked anything of anybody. People passed by him as
if he was not there. He was taken for granted.</p><p>The day came for the master to leave his body, and he said, "Before I
leave my body I want to choose my successor. The way I want to choose is
this: whoever knows the right answer should come in the night and write
it on my door; if the answer is right, he will receive my robe and my
bowl."</p><p>This ex-general, Hui Ming, was certainly the most important person of
the whole following of the master, and everybody thought that he would
be the winner. So he went in the night and he wrote on the door,
"No-mind is the answer." But he was so afraid of the master -- afraid
that if it is found to be wrong he is going to get a good beating --
that he did not sign it. He thought, "If it is right then I will declare
that I have written it; if it is wrong then it is better to keep
silent."</p><p>In the morning when the master woke up he said, "Who is that idiot?"
Hearing this, Hui Ming escaped from the monastery -- somebody may inform
the master because a few people had got the idea ... they were looking
out for who was going to write. In fact it was public knowledge that it
was Hui Ming!</p><p>Two monks, after taking their food, were just passing by Hui Neng and
discussing, saying, "The master is too hard. The answer seems to be
right: "no-mind" is the whole philosophy of Gautam Buddha. What more can
be said?" People had completely forgotten that Hui Neng even speaks; for
twenty years he had not spoken a single word to anybody. He simply did
his work, would go to sleep, wake up, start his work again. That day,
listening to those two monks saying that the answer seems to be right
and the master is too hard, he laughed. Those two monks stopped and they
said, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>He said, "Whoever wrote that is an idiot." This was exactly what the
master had said, "Who is the idiot who has spoiled my door?" Those monks
could not believe it, but they informed the master that a man of the
name of Hui Neng, whom he had sent twenty years before to the mess, had
said exactly the same thing: "Whoever wrote this is an idiot."</p><p>The master said, "I know. He is the only man ... I was hoping that he
would come and write the answer. But I forgot completely that in the
first place he is non-ambitious; in the second place he cannot write, he
is illiterate; in the third place I had prohibited him: 'Whenever the
time comes I will come to you, you have to remain in the work I have
given to you. Never show your face.'"</p><p>In the middle of the night the master came, woke up Hui Neng, gave
him the bowl and his robe and said, "Now escape, because you are a
simple fellow. There is great competition, and there are dangerous
people -- that man Hui Ming has been a general, he is a warrior. They
will try to snatch away the robe and the bowl, so you simply escape as
far away as possible."</p><p>Hui Neng said, "But I don't know anything. Moreover, I have not
committed any crime. Why should you make me your successor? Why can't I
be left to live peacefully? You can find ... so many people are eager,
wanting to be the successor, why are you bothering me?"</p><p>But the master said, "These are the reasons why I am bothering you: a
man who is not interested at all is the right man. A man who has no
ambitions is worthy. A man who can refuse the highest stage in the
tradition of Zen of being a patriarch, a master of masters ..."</p><p>Hui Neng still tried to persuade him, "Just let me clean rice and
don't disturb my sleep! I am tired and in the morning I have to start my
work again, and just think of twelve thousand monks and their rice
..."</p><p>The master said, "Stop all this! If people become aware that I have
chosen you they will kill you. Just take this bowl and this robe and run
away, because tomorrow morning I am going to die, and before that I want
you to be miles away." That's how Hui Neng was chosen to be the
successor.</p><p>Strange people ... and strange are their stories, but of tremendous
importance. This Hui Neng was followed by Hui Ming, the general, with
thousands of people, to catch hold of him and forcibly take away the
bowl and the robe so that Hui Ming could declare himself the master.
This is the background to the story.</p><p>Ming was the first to overtake Hui Neng, and there were many others
also following. THE SIXTH PATRIARCH THREW DOWN THE ROBE AND BOWL ON A
ROCK AND SAID, "THIS ROBE SIGNIFIES FAITH: HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY
FORCE?" Faith cannot be</p><p>taken by force. Faith grows only in the climate of love. Faith is the
highest flowering; it cannot be taken away by force.</p><p>"So this is the robe and this is the bowl. But remember, THIS ROBE
SIGNIFIES FAITH, and you are only a general -- you know the ways of
force, you don't know the ways of love. HOW CAN IT BE TAKEN BY FORCE? If
you can take it by force, take it."</p><p>MING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE</p><p>THEM. It may seem to be fictitious, but in the deepest experience of
my own self I don't think it is fictitious. I have my own explanation of
why it happened ... Hui Neng was a man of peace and silence, a man
without any desires, and when such a man speaks, he speaks with
authority, his words are pure power. And when he said, "This bowl and
this robe represent faith, and faith cannot be taken by force," his very
statement would have weakened Hui Ming.</p><p>Hui Ming knew perfectly well that he does not have faith, he knows
only what force is. It must have weakened his whole will. It is not a
miracle; it is a simple psychological fact. He tried to pick it up ...
but he must have tried knowing perfectly well that he could not pick it
up.</p><p>There is a place near a beautiful river, Narmada, where there was a
temple of Shiva. Outside every temple of Shiva is his bodyguard, the
bull; the bull sits outside the temple. There is a story that underneath
the bull at that particular temple -- it is an ancient temple -- there
is a little space which you can pass through ... but only if you have
faith.</p><p>I had gone there with a friend who was a professor -- full of doubts,
although he was not too fat. When I told him, "Try to pass through this
small space underneath the bull," he said, "I don't see any problem.
Because I am not a fat man, I can pass."</p><p>I said to him, "You cannot pass, because unless you have faith ... It
is not a question of being fat or being thin; I have seen fat people
passing through it, and I have seen thin people getting caught."</p><p>He said, "It is all nonsense, I will show you." But even while he was
saying it, deep inside he was trembling. A crowd gathered, which made it
even more fearful, and he was caught in the middle. He started shouting
-- "Help me!"</p><p>I said, "In questions of faith, nobody can help. Try your logic, try
your reason, try your arguments." And people were laughing! They were
laughing because he was so thin, why has he got caught? He just lost his
nerve. He knew perfectly well he had no faith, he had no trust, he was
full of doubts -- he is doubt and nothing else. He knew perfectly well
in the depths of his heart that he could not pass.</p><p>I had to pull him out -- of course from the back side, "because," I
said, "from the front I cannot, because I cannot go against the rule."
So I had to pull him by his legs, backwards. He looked very strange.</p><p>He said, "I can see that the space is enough, but something inside me
simply gave way. I simply lost my nerve." I myself went through that
small space, and I was at least twice the weight of the professor.</p><p>There are things which may look like fictions if you don't understand
man and his psychology. To me this is not a fiction, this is a
historical fact. It must have happened. The words of Hui Neng must have
created the atmosphere, the climate, such that Hui Ming lost his
willpower. He tried, but he had no force. He suddenly became
impotent.</p><p>MING TRIED TO PICK UP THE ROBE AND BOWL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THEM.
AT THAT POINT HE SAID, "I HAVE COME FOR THE DHARMA, NOT FOR THE ROBE."
THE PATRIARCH SAID, "SINCE YOU'VE COME FOR THE DHARMA, YOU SHOULD PUT TO
REST ALL YOUR MOTIVATIONS, AND DON'T GIVE RISE TO A SINGLE THOUGHT, AND
I WILL EXPLAIN FOR YOU." AFTER A SILENCE, HE SAID, "WITHOUT THINKING OF
GOOD, AND WITHOUT THINKING OF EVIL, AT JUST SUCH A TIME, WHICH IS YOUR
ORIGINAL FACE?"</p><p>When there is no movement of thought, desire, motivation -- at such a
moment you are, in your original purity. And to know this original face
is to know all.</p><p>AT THESE WORDS, HUI MING WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE ALSO ASKED,
"BESIDES THE INTIMATE WORDS AND MEANING THAT STRUCK HOME OF A MOMENT
AGO, IS THERE ANY FURTHER INTIMATE MESSAGE?" THE</p><p>PATRIARCH SAID, "IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT WOULDN'T BE INTIMATE"
--</p><p>because words create distance.</p><p>The intimate is not a communication.</p><p>The intimate is a transmission from heart to heart ... In silence, in
love, in peace.</p><p>Nothing is said, nothing is heard, but everything is understood ...
that is intimate.</p><p>"IF IT WERE SAID TO YOU, IT WOULD NOT BE INTIMATE. IF YOU TURN</p><p>AROUND AND REFLECT, WHAT'S INTIMATE IS IN YOU" -- it is not outside
you. You are the most intimate to yourself; nobody can be closer to you
than yourself. However close somebody may come to you, that closeness is
still a distance. Only you are intimate.</p><p>MING SAID, "THOUGH I WAS AT HUANG MEI, I NEVER REALLY HAD</p><p>INSIGHT" -- he recognized that although he had been in the monastery
for years studying, disciplining himself, he had never had any real
insight -- "INTO MY OWN FACE. NOW, ENCOUNTERING YOUR INSTRUCTION, I AM
LIKE A MAN DRINKING WATER WHO KNOWS FOR HIMSELF WHETHER IT'S COLD OR
WARM."</p><p>"JUST KNOW HOW TO BE A BUDDHA: DON'T WORRY THAT A BUDDHA WON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK." SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE PATH,
SINCE THEY ARE FULL THEMSELVES, HAVE PUT FORTH THEIR OWN SURPLUS TO
RESPOND TO POTENTIALS AND RECEIVE BEINGS. THEY ARE LIKE A BRIGHT MIRROR
ON ITS STAND, LIKE A BRIGHT JEWEL IN THE PALM OF THE HAND; WHEN AN
OUTSIDER COMES, AN OUTSIDER APPEARS, AND WHEN A NATIVE COMES, A NATIVE
APPEARS. AND IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL: IF IT WERE INTENTIONAL, THEN THERE
WOULD BE A REAL DOCTRINE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE. YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR.</p><p>These are the two ways ... whether you want to be clear or you want
to be clever. However clever you become you will remain ignorant, and
you may know nothing, but if you are clear</p><p>-- a mirror without any dust -- you will reflect the very essence of
existence.</p><p>There is a strange story that before Hui Neng died, many years after
this incident, he chose Hui Ming to be his successor. What Ming could
not get by force, he got by becoming non-ambitious, meditative. When Hui
Neng asked him, "Now the time has come for me to depart and, Hui Ming,
you have been so ambitious to be the patriarch, you may have the bowl
and the robe which you could not take with all your force. Are you ready
now?", Hui Ming said, "I am no more interested. There are many
others."</p><p>Hui Neng, the illiterate, became one of the greatest Zen masters,
just by his simplicity, just by his innocent ways. He attracted many
disciples of great qualities, and he had many followers who could have
been chosen as his successor. But first he told Hui Ming, "You were so
desirous; I wanted to give it to you at that very moment, but it was not
within my capacity: neither I could give it, nor was it in your capacity

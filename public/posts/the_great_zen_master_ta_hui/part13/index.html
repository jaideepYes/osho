USUALLY (TO MEDITATE) YOU SET YOUR MIND ON A STILL CONCENTRATION POINT -- BUT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO USE IT RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HUBBUB ...\nVIMALKIRTI SAID, \"IT'S LIKE THIS: THE HIGH PLATEAU DOES NOT PRODUCE LOTUS FLOWERS; IT'S THE MIRE OF THE LOW SWAMPLANDS THAT PRODUCES THESE FLOWERS.\" THE OLD BARBARIAN (BUDDHA) SAID, \"TRUE THUSNESS DOES NOT KEEP TO ITS OWN NATURE, BUT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGS ABOUT ALL PHENOMENAL THINGS ...\"\nDON'T CLING TO STILLNES (TO K'UNG HUI)\nONCE YOU HAVE ACHIEVED PEACEFUL STILLNESS OF BODY AND MIND, YOU MUST MAKE EARNEST EFFORT. DO NOT IMMEDIATELY SETTLE DOWN IN PEACEFUL STILLNESS. IN THE TEACHINGS THIS IS CALLED \"THE DEEP PIT OF LIBERATION,\" MUCH TO BE FEARED. YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF TURN FREELY LIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON THE WATER, INDEPENDENT AND FREE, NOT SUBJECT TO RESTRAINTS, ENTERING PURITY AND IMPURITY WITHOUT BEING OBSTRUCTED OR SINKING DOWN. ONLY THEN DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE SCHOOL OF THE PATCHROBED MONKS. IF YOU JUST MANAGE TO CRADLE THE UNCRYING CHILD IN YOUR ARMS, WHAT'S THE USE?\nDON'T PRAY FOR RELIEF\nLIN CHI SAID, \"IF YOU CAN PUT TO REST THE MIND THAT FRANTICALLY SEEKS FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, YOU WILL BE NO DIFFERENT FROM OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA.\"\nHE WASN'T FOOLING PEOPLE. EVEN BODHISATTVAS OF THE SEVENTH STAGE SEEK BUDDHA-KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT THEIR MINDS BEING SATISFIED: THEREFORE IT IS CALLED \"AFFLICTION.\" REALLY THERE'S NO WAY TO MANAGE: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY THE SLIGHTEST EXTERNAL MEASURE.\nSEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CERTAIN LAYMAN, HSU, WHO WAS ABLE TO FIND AN OPENING; HE SENT ME A LETTER, EXPRESSING HIS UNDERSTANDING, THAT SAID, \"EMPTY AND OPEN IN MY DAILY ACTIVITIES, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING OPPOSING ME; FINALLY I REALIZE THAT ALL\nTHINGS IN THE THREE WORLDS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY NONEXISTENT. TRULY THIS IS PEACE AND HAPPINESS, JOYFUL LIVELINESS, HAVING CAST IT ALL AWAY.\" ACCORDINGLY I INSTRUCTED HIM WITH A VERSE:\nDON'T BE FOND OF PURITY: PURITY MAKES PEOPLE WEARY. DON'T BE FOND OF JOYFUL LIVELINESS: JOYFUL LIVELINESS MAKES PEOPLE CRAZY. AS WATER CONFORMS TO THE VESSEL, IT ACCORDINGLY BECOMES SQUARE OR ROUND, SHORT OR LONG. AS FOR CASTING AWAY OR NOT CASTING AWAY, PLEASE THINK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY. THE THREE WORLDS AND MYRIAD THINGS ARE NO REFUGE -- WHERE IS THERE ANY HOME?\nIF YOU ARE JUST THUS, THIS IS A GREAT CONTRADICTION. THIS IS TO INFORM LAYMAN HSU THAT HIS OWN KIN ARE CREATING DISASTER. OPEN WIDE THE EYE OF THE THOUSAND SAGES, AND DO NOT KEEP PRAYING FOR RELIEF.\nEMPTYING MIND AND OBJECTS\nIN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF A STUDENT OF THE PATH, TO EMPTY OBJECTS IS EASY BUT TO EMPTY MIND IS HARD. IF OBJECTS ARE EMPTY BUT MIND IS NOT EMPTY, MIND WILL BE OVERCOME BY OBJECTS.\nJUST EMPTY THE MIND, AND OBJECTS WILL BE EMPTY OF THEMSELVES. IF THE MIND IS ALREADY EMPTIED, BUT THEN YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT WISHING TO EMPTY ITS OBJECTS, THIS MEANS THAT THIS MIND IS NOT YET EMPTY AND IS AGAIN CARRIED AWAY BY OBJECTS. IF THIS SICKNESS IS NOT DONE AWAY WITH, THERE IS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF BIRTH AND DEATH.\nHAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE VERSE WHICH LAYMAN P'ANG PRESENTED TO MA TSU?\nIN THE TEN DIRECTIONS, THE SAME CONGREGATION: EACH AND EVERY ONE STUDIES NON-DOING. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE BUDDHAS ARE CHOSEN: MINDS EMPTY, THEY RETURN SUCCESSFUL.\nTa Hui is constantly in a dilemma. His dilemma is: he wants to be recognized as an enlightened man, but this is only his ambition, his greed; it is not his experience.\nWhenever he quotes some enlightened person, the quotation has great significance. But when he himself comments on the quotation, those commentaries are just crap. He uses all great words, but the words coming from an intellectual don't carry the meaning -- the same meaning -- as they carry when coming out of an enlightened being. And you will see his unconscious continually making sarcastic remarks, sometimes so ugly and condemnable that one cannot think that this man has even begun to grasp the meaning of enlightenment.\nI will show you how fast asleep the man is -- he is talking in his sleep. He is clever and cunning. He can manage to befool people who are not enlightened because they don't have anything to compare his statements with. They don't have any of their own experience as a criterion to decide whether what he is saying is worth saying, or if he is just making much fuss about nothing.\nThe first sutra:\nWORLDLY PASSIONS ARE LIKE A BLAZING FIRE; WHEN WILL THEY EVER END?\nNow this is from a man who, in his previous sutras, has said that everything is illusory -- the world is illusory, the senses are illusory, the mind is illusory, even the Buddha is illusory!\nIf everything is illusory, then from where come these worldly passions which are like a blazing fire? They are not illusory. He has forgotten, because it was not his own understanding. He simply quoted. But the reality is, he knows his passions are like a blazing fire; he has not gone beyond passions.\nTalking about even Buddha as an illusion is not only stupid, it is immensely harmful. People who will read it, if they see that even Buddha is illusory, enlightenment is illusory, will wonder then what is the point of unnecessarily running from one illusion to another illusion?\nOne illusion cannot be better than another illusion. Illusions are simply illusions; there is no qualitative difference.\nRIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HUBBUB, YOU MUST NOT FORGET THE BUSINESS OF THE BAMBOO CHAIR AND REED CUSHION.\nHe cannot say directly, \"Don't forget meditation.\" The word 'meditation' somehow hurts all intellectuals, because it is something beyond the grasp of the intellect. They want to be on the top, and suddenly they feel that there is something more beyond their grasp. So rather than simply using the word 'meditation', he says, \"Don't forget the business of the bamboo chair and reed cushion.\"\nHe may think he is being very clever, but it is just his unconscious showing itself -- its antagonism for meditation. He is not a man of meditation at all.\nUSUALLY (TO MEDITATE) YOU SET YOUR MIND ON A STILL CONCENTRATION POINT ...\nThat is absolutely wrong! That's why I say the man is not a man of meditation. Concentration is not meditation; concentration is a faculty of the mind. Mind concentrates;\nmeditation is the absence of mind. Mind cannot do anything about meditation. It simply does\nnot know meditation, and there is no intrinsic possibility for the mind ever to come in contact with meditation. Just as I said before, darkness cannot come in contact with light because darkness is only an absence -- so is the mind.\nMind is the absence of meditation.\nThe moment meditation arises in you, mind is found nowhere.\nA Sufi mystic, Junnaid, who himself finally became a great master, was with his old master. One day, early in the morning, the master said, \"Just look outside to see if it is still dark.\"\nSo Junnaid said, \"Okay,\" and he took the lamp.\nHe was going out when the master said, \"Wait! If you take the lamp with you, how are you going to find out whether it is dark or not? Leave the lamp here.\"\nJunnaid was only in his disciplehood. He said, \"If you say so I will leave it, but without a lamp how can I see whether it is dark or not? A little light is needed to see anything.\" That is true about everything else, but not about darkness. If you go with a lamp into the house searching for darkness, you will not find it. The same is true about mind and meditation.\nTa Hui thinks meditation is to set your mind on a still concentration point. A concentration point is within the capacity of mind; it has its utility. The whole of scientific work comes out of concentration of the mind, focusing the mind, not allowing it to move anywhere, staying only on a single point.\nIn the ancient story of Mahabharata -- the great Indian war that happened five thousand years ago -- there was a famous archer, Dronacharya. All the princes used to come to learn archery from him. His most intimate disciple was Arjuna, whose concentration was the reason for this intimacy, because archery depends on concentration.\nOne day Dronacharya was examining his disciples. He asked one disciple, Yudhishthira, Arjuna's eldest brother ... Dronacharya had hung a dead bird on a tree, and the dead bird's right eye was the target. He told Yudhishthira -- he was the first, being the eldest -- \"Take the bow and the arrow, but before you shoot, I have to ask you something.\"\nHe became ready with his bow and arrow, and Dronacharya asked him, \"What are you seeing?\"\nHe said, \"I see everything -- all the trees, all the birds.\"\nThe second man was called in and asked, \"What are you seeing?\" He said, \"I can see only the bird.\"\nThe third man was Arjuna. Dronacharya asked him, \"What are you seeing?\" Arjuna said, \"Only the right eye of the bird.\"\nThen Dronacharya told all three to shoot their arrows. Yudhishthira's arrow went so far off ... you cannot even say it missed -- the distance between his arrow and the bird was so big. The second man's was a little closer, but still did not reach the right eye -- it hit the bird. But Arjuna's arrow hit exactly the right eye of the bird. And the right eye of the bird on a faraway tree is such a small spot ...\nBut Dronacharya said, \"Just your answers had given me a sense of who was going to hit the target. If you see so many trees, you are not focused. If you see only the bird you are more focused, but still you are not focused on the right eye. The whole bird is a big thing in comparison to the right eye. But when Arjuna said, 'I can't see anything else except the right eye,' then it was certain that his arrow was going to reach the target.\"\nIn science, in archery, in other arts, concentration may be of great use -- but it is not meditation. And this is the point that justifies my continuous insistence that Ta Hui is an intellectual: he has no idea even what meditation is.\nMeditation is going beyond the mind. It has nothing to do with the mind -- except going beyond it. It is not a faculty of the mind, it is transcendental to mind. When you can see\nwithout the mind in between you and existence, you are in meditation. It is not concentration. It is utterly silent. It is not focusing ... it is absolutely unfocused awareness.\nBUT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO USE IT RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HUBBUB.\nThis is the problem with the man -- he has collected from every source, without knowing whether those statements connect with each other or not.\nConcentration cannot be practiced in the midst of the hubbub; concentration needs a space where you are not disturbed by anything. That's why the people who believe in concentration have left the world and gone to the mountains, to the caves, to the desert, where there is nothing to distract them. They can just put their minds on Jesus Christ or Gautam Buddha or Krishna ... and there is nothing else.\nThe desert has been one of the most practical places for concentration; it is even better than the mountains, because in the mountains there is so much to see -- the birds are there, the animals are there, the trees are there, beautiful peaks with snow are there -- there are many possibilities for distraction. But in a desert, as far as you can see there is only desert, and desert ...\nBut meditation can be possible even in the marketplace, because it does not have to concentrate on anything. Meditation cannot be disturbed, it is all-inclusive. Concentration is exclusive; it excludes everything and just keeps the mind on one point.\nMeditation is all-inclusive. The car passes ... the mind in meditation is fully aware of the horn. The birds start singing ... the mind is fully aware of their singing. There is no question of distraction; nothing distracts. Everything -- the mind is no longer there -- is simply watched. You are only aware that there is a horn, a car is passing by -- but it is not a distraction.\nDistraction comes only when you are trying to concentrate, then anything -- a small ant crawling up your leg -- will be enough to distract you. But when you are in meditation, you simply know that the ant is crawling up your leg. If you like it, you allow it; if you don't like it, you throw it away. But there is no distraction -- your silence remains unscratched. How can the noises on the street distract you? You simply listen to them -- they don't make any impact on you. They come and go, and you remain just a witness.\nMeditation is possible in the hubbub of a marketplace ... Ta Hui has heard some man of meditation talking, but he has never meditated himself; all that he knows is concentration of the mind.\nVIMALKIRTI SAID, \"IT IS LIKE THIS: THE HIGH PLATEAU DOES NOT PRODUCE LOTUS FLOWERS; IT IS THE MIRE OF THE LOW SWAMPLANDS THAT PRODUCES THESE FLOWERS.\"\nHe is quoting Vimalkirti, but he is not commenting on it. He is just throwing names in to decorate his sutras. I don't think he has understood what Vimalkirti means.\nVimalkirti was one of the strangest people who came in contact with Gautam Buddha. He never became a sannyasin -- he remained a layman -- but even Gautam Buddha respected him.\nHe used to come to listen to Gautam Buddha, and he was meditating, but he could not see that there was any need to renounce the world and become a sannyasin and a beggar. He was such a genius that he was the first layman to become enlightened. The first sannyasin to become enlightened was Manjushri, and the first layman to become enlightened was Vimalkirti.\nBut Vimalkirti was a very strange person. For a few days he had not come, and Buddha was concerned ... is he sick, or is there some trouble? -- why is he not coming? So he asked that one of his disciples should offer to go to Vimalkirti -- he lived in the city -- to enquire about his health and why he is not coming.\nBut out of ten thousand sannyasins, nobody wanted to go, for the simple reason that even to say hello to Vimalkirti was dangerous! He would make it a point of great discussion -- \"To whom are you saying hello? Are you certain I am not a dream? Can you give me any evidence that I am not a dream? If you see me in a dream, will you recognize that it is a dream and not reality?\"\nHe used to put everybody in such a corner -- on any point. If you didn't say anything and you simply tried to avoid him, he would say, \"Hey, where are you going? Is there any place to go? The truth is right here now. Where are you going?\" He had tortured almost everybody.\nFinally one disciple said, \"I will go. Whatever he does I will take it easy, but he has to be asked after.\" When the disciple went he said, \"Gautam Buddha has sent me to enquire about your health. As I came here, just outside your house, your family said that you are sick.\"\nRather than answering him, the sick Vimalkirti said, \"Sick? About whom are you talking? I don't exist at all, how can I be sick? To be sick you first have to exist -- what do you think? I have disappeared long ago in my meditations. So just go back and tell Gautam Buddha, 'Vimalkirti is no more -- there is no question of sickness or health.'\"\nThe disciple was very much disturbed, because if he tells Gautam Buddha that Vimalkirti is no more, he will think that perhaps he has died. So he told Vimalkirti, \"This statement can be misunderstood. If I say simply that Vimalkirti is no more, the obvious meaning will be that Vimalkirti is dead.\"\nHe said, \"That's the right meaning! Vimalkirti is dead. It was a phony name which disappeared with meditation. When I was born I was not Vimalkirti, and when I was reborn in meditation I again became nameless, formless -- it is perfectly right. You can even say that Vimalkirti is dead.\"\nThe disciple said, \"That is too much, because you are alive and I will be in trouble.\nTomorrow you may appear before Buddha, and he will ask me, 'What were you saying?'\"\nAnd in this way a whole sutra, Vimalkirti's Hridaya Sutra, has developed between the disciple and Vimalkirti. He is so clear that you cannot catch hold of him, you cannot grasp him. He is so vast that whatever you say, you are immediately caught.\nQuoting from Vimalkirti is just to decorate Ta Hui's sutras, but he does not comment on it.\nPerhaps he does not understand it either.\nVIMALKIRTI SAID, \"IT IS LIKE THIS: THE HIGH PLATEAU DOES NOT PRODUCE LOTUS FLOWERS; IT IS THE MIRE OF THE LOW SWAMPLANDS THAT PRODUCES THESE FLOWERS.\"\nThe lotus comes out of mud, out of swamplands. It is perhaps the best flower -- the biggest flower, the most fragrant and the most delicate. No other flower can be compared with it, yet it is born out of mud.\nVimalkirti is saying, \"Don't be worried about man's ignorance, his anger, his greed, his lust, his desire for power and for money, his attachment to things, his aggressiveness, his violence ... Don't be worried -- this is the mud out of which the lotus of enlightenment arises. Accept it all, because the lotus flower cannot be born on high land, on a plateau. So you should be grateful to all your ignorance, all your anger, all your greed, your sex ...\"\nWhatever the religions have been condemning, Vimalkirti is saying be grateful to it because it is only out of this that the buddha is born, that the lotus flower comes out. But Ta Hui does not make any comment on it. This is strange. If you are not going to make any comment, then there is no need to quote. On the contrary, he goes on speaking in a very ugly way. THE OLD BARBARIAN ... he calls Gautam Buddha \"the old barbarian.\"\nThe Chinese, just like everybody else, think that they are the most cultured people. When Marco Polo reached China, he wrote in his diary:\n\"These people cannot be thought of as human beings. They look like human beings but they are a lower species. They eat snakes, they eat dogs, there is nothing that they will leave; they eat everything! They look very strange, and their ideas are very strange. With high cheekbones they are ugly, but they think high cheekbones are immensely beautiful. They have only a few hairs in their beards, you can count them -- at the most twelve! Their mustaches also have very few hairs, which can be counted on the fingers. Very strange people! It seems they are on the way to becoming human beings.\"\nThe emperor of China, who invited Marco Polo to his court, told his historian to write about him, \"We have heard that these people believe that man has come from the monkeys. We could not believe it because we had not seen these people\" -- Marco Polo was the first westerner to visit China. The emperor continued, \"But they are perfectly right! As far as they are concerned, monkeys are their forefathers. They look like monkeys.\"\nBut this is the situation everywhere. Indians think they are the purest Aryans, the Germans think they are the purest Aryans. The word arya is Sanskrit -- it means 'the highest'. Everybody thinks ... But to use the word 'barbarian' for Gautam Buddha -- and that, too, by a man who pretends to be his disciple -- is simply inconceivable. If Gautam Buddha is a barbarian, then in the whole world nobody has ever been a cultured man.\nEven now Buddha is the most cultured man, the most graceful. His beauty is such that Friedrich Nietzsche condemned him because of his grace and his beauty. He looked feminine to Nietzsche, because his idea of a real man was to be strong and to be made of steel ... grace, beauty? -- those are feminine qualities.\nNietzsche condemned Gautam Buddha: \"I cannot believe in his teachings. They are dangerous, they will turn the whole world into a feminine world. I want man to keep his manhood and not to be impressed by people like Gautam Buddha.\"\nNietzsche loved the warrior -- that was his ideal for every man -- as sharp as the blade of the sword, as hard as steel, neither worried about killing, nor worried about being killed; these are just manly games.\nGautam Buddha is teaching nonviolence -- don't kill anybody. He is teaching compassion, he is teaching love, and he is teaching meditation -- which will make you graceful, loving,\ncompassionate, but your manhood will disappear. You may become a roseflower, but you will not be a sword.\nFriedrich Nietzsche may be wrong but his esteem is right. He cannot call Gautam Buddha a barbarian. Perhaps there is no other man who was so cultured as Gautam Buddha. But Ta Hui is calling him, \"the old barbarian.\"\nBUDDHA SAID, \"TRUE THUSNESS DOES NOT KEEP TO ITS OWN NATURE, BUT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGS ABOUT ALL PHENOMENAL THINGS.\"\nThe quotation is right. Buddha is saying true thusness is always ready to change with the circumstances. It has no resistance, because resistance means ego, resistance means, \"I have my own will. I will go on my path.\"\nTo accept life in its totality, as it is, means to relax and let life take charge of you; then wherever it takes you, go with it. This is his most fundamental teaching of suchness or thusness.\nSuch a man is always at peace. Whatever happens makes no problem for him; he simply goes with it with total willingness. Not only does he have no resistance, on the other hand he welcomes life in whatever form it comes. He welcomes death -- even death cannot disturb him. There is nothing that can disturb him because he goes with everything, allows it ...\nHe is just like a leaf dropping from the tree. If the wind takes it up, it goes up; if the wind takes it to the north, it goes to the north; if the wind takes it to the south, it goes to the south; if the wind drops it on the ground, it rests on the ground. It does not say to the wind, \"This is very contradictory -- you just started going north, and now you have started going south. I don't want to go south -- I am destined for the north.\" No, the leaf has no destination of its own.\nExistence has its own destination, and the man of meditation makes existence's destination his own destination. He makes no separation at all. If existence feels it is time for death, then it is time for death. His ability to accept is total. Such a man cannot be in pain, in agony, in misery, in anguish -- he has cut the very root of all these things.\nONCE YOU HAVE ACHIEVED PEACEFUL STILLNESS OF BODY AND MIND, YOU MUST MAKE EARNEST EFFORT.\nNow these are Ta Hui's words. Whenever he quotes, that quotation is great. But whenever he comes to his own understanding, he falls very low. He says, \"Once you have achieved peaceful stillness of body and mind ...\"\nIn the first place, a man like Gautam Buddha will not use the word 'achievement', because it is not an achievement -- it is only a discovery. Secondly, he will not say \"peaceful stillness of body and mind.\" He will say \"transcendence of body and mind\" -- only then can you be still. Body and mind cannot be still by their very nature. Thirdly, he says, \"You must make earnest effort.\" The meditator does not make any effort.\nThe whole idea of Gautam Buddha about meditation is so unique and so tremendously beautiful that it has been a problem for other religions to understand it -- because every religion thinks earnest effort is needed. But Gautam Buddha's idea is beautifully represented by Basho's haiku: \"Sitting silently, doing nothing ... the spring comes and the grass grows by itself.\" There is no question of any effort; you are simply sitting, doing nothing ...\nIf you want to do something, effort is needed. But if you are in a state of non-doing, no effort is needed ... and if, for non-doing, effort is needed, what kind of non-doing will it be? Effort is doing, and out of doing, you cannot create non-doing. You have to renounce doing.\nSitting silently, doing nothing ... the spring comes. It is not your effort that brings the spring; it comes, in its turn. It has always been coming. And when the spring comes, you don't have to pull the grass and make earnest effort so that it grows -- it grows on its own accord. The grass grows by itself ...\nNobody except Buddha has come to this tremendous discovery, that meditation is a very simple phenomenon. You just relax -- but not the American way! I cannot forgive a man who has written a book, YOU MUST RELAX! That 'must' destroys the whole idea of relaxation, but that is the American idea -- \"you must relax.\" And the book has sold very well, because everybody wants to relax. It is well-written, but the person does not know anything about relaxation. It cannot be a must.\nRelaxation has to be a very simple understanding ... no effort, no doing -- you just sit silently, and let your body relax. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to achieve, so there is no point in being tense -- because you have it already within you. Relaxation becomes possible without any effort. You are sitting where you want to reach, so what is the point of making any effort? You have always been in the space where you want to be, you just have not looked inwards. No achievement, no longing, no desire, nowhere else to go ... relaxation comes on its own.\nA relaxation which has been managed is not much of a relaxation. There is bound to be a subtle tension around it -- you are holding it. You can sit silently, still, but deep down you are very tense, you are holding yourself still -- no movement. This is not stillness, this is fake. Stillness should be natural. And how can it be natural?\nBuddha's whole philosophy gives you the right situation in which it happens on its own accord. There is nothing to achieve -- there is no God, there is no heaven, there is no hell. All that you need is already given to you, you have it within you. You are not a sinner that has to pray continuously to get rid of your sins. You are as pure as Buddha himself. The only difference -- and that does not make you inferior in any way -- is that you are not aware of it.\nYou have the Kohinoor -- the most precious diamond -- within you, but you are not aware of it. Buddha is aware of it.\nSo all that needs to happen is sitting silently, waiting for the spring, waiting for the right moment ... when your relaxation comes to its highest peak, when your silence becomes absolute, the spring has come. And \"the grass grows by itself\" is only a symbol. It is a symbol that you, your potential, starts growing on its own, spontaneously. It is a natural phenomenon, it is an intrinsic capacity -- you don't have to do anything.\nSo when Ta Hui says you must make earnest effort, he misses completely the whole new message of Gautam Buddha.\nDO NOT IMMEDIATELY SETTLE DOWN IN PEACEFUL STILLNESS. IN THE TEACHINGS THIS IS CALLED \"THE DEEP PIT OF LIBERATION.\"\nWhenever he quotes, because the quotation is not his, he is right. But whenever he says anything of his own, he is wrong. Now this is certainly right -- it is a quotation.\n\"The deep pit of liberation\" -- there is a danger for all seekers, for all people of the path, that you may settle for a small treasure. Just a little silence, a little relaxation, a little peace, and you may think you have come home. This they call the \"deep pit of liberation.\" You have settled long before you have blossomed.\nSo one has to be alert not to settle anywhere. Just go on growing -- allow your potential to grow. Don't start feeling, \"I have come, I have arrived.\" Your potential is immense, and your treasure is incalculable.\nSo go on and on and on ... and you will find more and more peace, more profound spaces, more juicy experiences. Your desert-like life you will find slowly turning into a green beautiful garden. You will find many, many flowers blossoming within you. Just go on ... there is no end to your growth.\nOne never comes to the end of one's growth. It is always coming closer -- but just coming closer. You cannot come to the end of the road because existence is eternal, and you are one with existence. Your journey, your pilgrimage, is also to be eternal.\nYOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF TURN FREELY -- now these are Ta Hui's words -- LIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON THE WATER, INDEPENDENT AND FREE ...\nThe gourd is not independent and is not free! The gourd cannot go against the current -- how can it go? It is simply moving with the current. Wherever the river is going, it is going -- what kind of independence is this? The gourd wants to stop at some place; it cannot, because the river is continuously moving. What kind of freedom is this?\nNo, this example is absolutely wrong. You can say the gourd is relaxed, you can say the gourd is no longer resistant, you can say the gourd has total acceptance -- wherever the river takes it. But you cannot say that it is independent and free. That would be an absolutely absurd idea. What independence can it have? It cannot go against the current, it cannot stop when it wants ... If the river moves to the south, it has to move to the south; it cannot say, \"No, I don't want to go south.\" It is neither free nor independent.\nHe must have heard about the gourd ... that a man should relax just like a gourd in the river. It is immensely graceful because there is no resistance, no tension, no fight. In fact, it has become almost one with the river. It has no ideas different from the river, it has no intentions different from the river, it has nothing of what you call 'will power'. It has surrendered completely to the river. It has great peace and silence, acceptance, thusness.\nThis example of the gourd has been used by Buddha for thusness, for suchness, for tathata.\nBut it is not used for freedom and independence.\n... NOT SUBJECT TO RESTRAINTS, ENTERING PURITY AND IMPURITY WITHOUT BEING OBSTRUCTED OR SINKING DOWN.\nBut this does not show its independence! When the river moves into impurity, the gourd has to move in impurity. When the river moves in pure waters, the gourd has to move in pure waters.\nIt simply shows that Ta Hui has not understood the idea of surrendering yourself to nature totally. In that surrender, you have disappeared -- who is going to be independent, and who is going to be free? That does not mean that you have become a slave, and that does not mean that you have become dependent. These are the subtleties of the experience of surrender.\nYou have become one with existence. You are neither dependent nor independent -- you are no more. And YOU have been the problem ... so now, because you are no more, there is no problem.\nONLY THEN DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE SCHOOL OF THE PATCHROBED MONKS.\nNo, he is not right.\nAnd again he is using sarcastic remarks ... patchrobed monks. Buddha used to say to his disciples, \"People throw out clothes when they are useless or rotten or have been used too much. Collect those pieces of cloth and make patchrobes; just put those pieces of cloth together and make a robe. That way you will not be a burden on people for your robes.\"\nIt was a great idea in itself. Buddha's whole effort was that his people should not be a burden and parasite on poor people, so he had taken every care. \"You should not take your food from one house, you should take your food from five houses -- just a small piece from one house, another small piece from another house -- so you are not a burden.\n\"You should not remain longer than three days in one place; you should not ask for food from the same house while you are three days in the town; and you should collect thrown-away robes, clothes. And when the days of rain come, and for four months you cannot move and you have to stay in one place, then make patchrobes for yourself, for other sannyasins. You have enough time. So for clothes you are not dependent at all and for food your burden is negligible.\"\nIn fact, everybody enjoyed giving some food. Even in the poorest family, if a guest suddenly comes he can be accommodated. And he was not being dependent on one family but five families, and only one meal a day. So Buddha had minimized as much as possible the burden on the people, and people rejoiced without any reluctance. They wanted to share something with the monks, and this much they could manage.\nSometimes people used to give clothes to the monks, and Buddha had said that, \"If somebody gives you a cloth you should cut it in pieces, because it should not be that some monks are using patchrobes and some monks are using clothes which are not patched. That will create unnecessary competitiveness.\"\nHe was very careful to create a commune of equals, without any conflict -- and he succeeded in it. There was no conflict. Even the newest clothes were cut down and patched again, so they looked the same as anybody else's. But Ta Hui's reference to the school of the 'patchrobed' is sarcastic, it is not respectful.\nIF YOU JUST MANAGE TO CRADLE THE UNCRYING CHILD IN YOUR ARMS, WHAT IS THE USE?\nHe is saying that just being silent -- a small silence, a small peace -- is not much use. It is just like cradling the uncrying child in your arms -- what is the use? About that he is right.\nYou should go to the profoundest ecstasy. Silence is only the beginning. Stillness is only the beginning, not the end.\nLIN CHI SAID, \"IF YOU CAN PUT TO REST THE MIND THAT FRANTICALLY SEEKS FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, YOU WILL BE NO DIFFERENT FROM OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA.\" HE WAS NOT FOOLING PEOPLE.\nLin Chi's statement is clear: If you can put to rest the mind that frantically seeks from moment to moment, you will be no different from old Shakyamuni Buddha.\nThe only difference between you and the awakened one is that you go on being dominated by the frantic mind, which is continuously restless. Buddha has overcome it; he has put his mind to rest. This is the only difference.\nBut Lin Chi is not being sarcastic -- he was a great master. He is saying, \"the old Shakyamuni Buddha\" -- shakya is his clan; hence he is called shakyamuni, the man from the Shakya clan who became utterly silent.\nIn fact, Ta Hui needed a master like Lin Chi. He says that Lin Chi was not fooling people. Why is he saying that? Perhaps unconsciously he knows that he is fooling people. He needed a man like Lin Chi. Lin Chi was the most strange master. I have told you about him ... he used to hit people, he used to beat his disciples, for no reason at all. And once he threw a disciple from the window of a two story building and then jumped on top of him. Sitting on his chest he asked him, \"Got it?\" And the strangest thing is that the disciple said, \"Yes, sir!\" because this was so surprising ...\nLin Chi had been beating him -- to that he had become accustomed. He knew that whenever he goes, he will get a good beating. But even to be beaten by a man like Lin Chi ... he was so beautiful, so loving. He was beating out of love; there was no anger in it. He was trying in every way to wake him up.\nBut beating had become known and familiar. That's why Lin Chi had to throw him out of the window -- to shock him completely: \"This is going too far!\" Then when he saw Lin Chi coming behind him, his mind must have stopped! And sitting on his chest, Lin Chi asked \"Got it?\"\nIn that moment the disciple must have been so quiet ... the mind cannot figure out what is happening, so the mind has to be at rest in such a moment. And the master's eyes, and his\ngrace, and his words, \"Got it?\" The answer came not from his mind, but from his very being. He said, \"Yes, sir.\"\nTa Hui needed a man like Lin Chi. Perhaps then he may have come to a state of no-mind, even for a single moment. And that would have changed his whole approach from intellectual to meditative.\nEVEN BODHISATTVAS OF THE SEVENTH STAGE SEEK BUDDHA- KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT THEIR MINDS BEING SATISFIED: THEREFORE IT IS CALLED \"AFFLICTION.\" REALLY THERE IS NO WAY TO MANAGE: IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY THE SLIGHTEST EXTERNAL MEASURE.\nAgain it is a quotation, and the quotation is right: Really there is no way to manage, because you cannot do anything for realization -- so naturally, there is no way to manage.\nOr in other words: if you drop managing, if you drop doing, if you drop effort, it happens on its own accord. But you cannot manage it, you cannot manage to be a buddha. If you manage to be a buddha it will only be a hypocrisy; you will be only an actor and nothing else.\nSEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CERTAIN LAYMAN, HSU, WHO WAS ABLE TO FIND AN OPENING; HE SENT ME A LETTER EXPRESSING HIS UNDERSTANDING, THAT SAID ...\nHere you will see that an ordinary layman has come to a great understanding of truth. The answer that Ta Hui sends him is so ordinary and irrelevant that it will make it clear to you that there is no question of comparing him with any Zen master. He is not even capable of understanding the experience that has happened to a layman, an ordinary man, and the way that man has expressed it.\nLayman Hsu sent Ta Hui a letter, and said in the letter,\n\"EMPTY AND OPEN IN MY DAILY ACTIVITIES, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING OPPOSING ME; FINALLY I REALIZE THAT ALL THINGS IN THE THREE WORLDS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY NONEXISTENT. TRULY THIS IS PEACE AND HAPPINESS, JOYFUL LIVELINESS, HAVING CAST IT ALL AWAY.\" ACCORDINGLY I INSTRUCTED HIM WITH A VERSE.\nHsu does not need any instruction from Ta Hui, but Ta Hui is pretending to be a great teacher.\nHsu has expressed his experience, which is perfectly in tune with Gautam Buddha and the Zen masters. The instruction that Ta Hui has sent is absolutely irrelevant. First he says, don't be fond of purity. Now in the letter the poor man has not said anything about purity! Don't be fond of purity: purity makes people weary. don't be fond of joyful liveliness ... Hsu has not\nsaid anything about that. He has simply said that a joyful liveliness has happened to him; he has not said that he is fond of it.\nJoyful liveliness makes people crazy. Ta Hui's instruction is dangerous ... because he was thought to be a great Zen master, accepted by the emperor. The poor man must have been disturbed by the instruction he was sent.\nAS WATER CONFORMS TO THE VESSEL, IT ACCORDINGLY BECOMES SQUARE OR ROUND, SHORT OR LONG. AS FOR CASTING AWAY OR NOT CASTING AWAY, PLEASE THINK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY.\nHe does not need the word 'think'.\nTHE THREE WORLDS AND MYRIAD THINGS ARE NO REFUGE -- WHERE IS THERE ANY HOME?\nHsu has not talked about all these things in which Hui is instructing him.\nIF YOU ARE JUST THUS, THIS IS A GREAT CONTRADICTION. THIS IS TO INFORM LAYMAN HSU THAT HIS OWN KIN ARE CREATING DISASTER -- OPEN WIDE THE EYE OF THE THOUSAND SAGES, AND DO NOT KEEP PRAYING FOR RELIEF.\nHe is not praying for relief, he is not disturbed by anything, he is not in any contradiction, he is not seeking any refuge ...! I would like to read Hsu's words again, so you can see how irrelevant is the instruction. But just to be the teacher, Ta Hui has to say something ...\nTa Hui has not even understood the layman's statement: \"Empty and open in my daily activities, there is not a single thing opposing me.\" When you are empty and open, how can anything oppose you? Opposition comes when you are there with a will, with a certain ego, with a certain desire -- then there is opposition. But if you are empty and open, naturally there is no opposition possible.\n\"FINALLY I REALIZE THAT ALL THINGS IN THE THREE WORLDS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY NONEXISTENT.\"\nIt has to be understood what, in the heritage of Gautam Buddha, the word 'nonexistent' means. It simply means nothing is stable, everything is changing.\nBuddha's definition of the existent is \"that which always remains the same.\" There is only one thing that is existent, and that is the witnessing self, the witnessing consciousness. It remains always the same ... past, present, future, from eternity to eternity, it is the same. This is the only existent thing. Everything else changes; every moment it is changing, and that which is changing is nonexistent. It does not mean that it is not there; it simply means that\nwhile you are seeing it, it is already changing. While you are listening to me, you are already changing -- your death is coming closer.\nThis world is ephemeral. The word 'nonexistent' in Buddha's philosophy simply means \"that which is ephemeral, that which goes on changing\" -- you cannot rely on it. The only thing you can rely on is your witnessing consciousness. It never changes. It is the very center of the cyclone. But about this, in his great instruction, Ta Hui does not say anything.\n\"TRULY THIS IS PEACE AND HAPPINESS, JOYFUL LIVELINESS. HAVING CAST IT ALL AWAY.\"\nHsu is not saying, \"I am fond of these things\" -- that, \"I desire them.\" He is saying, \"I have found them, they are there.\" And Ta Hui's instruction is absolutely out of place: don't be fond of purity -- I am amazed that he cannot see that what he is saying has no reference to the layman's letter --\nPURITY MAKES PEOPLE WEARY. DON'T BE FOND OF JOYFUL LIVELINESS: JOYFUL LIVELINESS MAKES PEOPLE CRAZY. AS WATER CONFORMS TO THE VESSEL, IT ACCORDINGLY BECOMES SQUARE OR ROUND, SHORT OR LONG. AS FOR CASTING AWAY OR NOT CASTING AWAY, PLEASE THINK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY.\nThinking is a very low activity; it is of the mind. Meditation is the highest within you; it is beyond mind. The layman has touched something beyond mind, and Ta Hui is dragging him down by saying, please think it over more carefully. The three worlds and myriad things are no refuge -- where is there any home? But the poor fellow has not asked about the home or any refuge.\nIF YOU ARE JUST THUS, THIS IS A GREAT CONTRADICTION.\nHsu has not said that he is just thus! He is simply saying that this is his awareness, his consciousness. He can see it, he is aware of his emptiness, his openness. And he has found that since the moment he became empty and open, not a single thing opposes him.\n\"And as I have entered into this emptiness and openness, I realized that all things in the three worlds are fundamentally nonexistent. Truly, this is peace and happiness, joyful liveliness.\" He is simply stating the experience of his meditation.\nTa Hui has not been able to understand it; his instruction is absolute nonsense. Finally he says, \"and do not keep praying for relief.\" Anybody can see that he is saying things just to pose as a great instructor.\nIN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF A STUDENT OF THE PATH ...\nTa Hui does not understand the difference between a student, a disciple, and a devotee.\nThe student is never on the path.\nIN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF A STUDENT OF THE PATH, TO EMPTY OBJECTS IS EASY BUT TO EMPTY MIND IS HARD.\nIt seems to be his own experience; otherwise to empty the mind is the simplest thing. A thing is hard when it needs great effort to do it, but to empty the mind needs no effort at all. How can it be hard?\nIF OBJECTS ARE EMPTY BUT MIND IS NOT EMPTY, MIND WILL BE OVERCOME BY OBJECTS.\nJUST EMPTY THE MIND, AND OBJECTS WILL BE EMPTY OF THEMSELVES. IF THE MIND IS ALREADY EMPTIED, BUT THEN YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT WISHING TO EMPTY ITS OBJECTS, THIS MEANS THAT THIS MIND IS NOT YET EMPTY AND IS AGAIN CARRIED AWAY BY OBJECTS. IF THIS SICKNESS IS NOT DONE AWAY WITH, THERE IS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF BIRTH AND DEATH.\nHAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE VERSE WHICH LAYMAN P'ANG PRESENTED TO MA TSU?\nIN THE TEN DIRECTIONS, THE SAME CONGREGATION: EACH AND EVERY ONE STUDIES NON-DOING.\nTa Hui is not clear anywhere that a seeker does not study. Only a student studies. A seeker absorbs, drinks. He absorbs the presence of the master, he allows the master's energy to transform his energy. The student collects information; the seeker is not interested in information -- his only interest is transformation. These are totally different things.\nEach and everyone studies non-doing. How can you study non-doing? Either you can be in the state of non-doing, or you cannot be. But studying is not possible.\nTHIS IS THE PLACE WHERE BUDDHAS ARE CHOSEN: MINDS EMPTY, THEY RETURN SUCCESSFUL.\nGautam Buddha will not use the word 'successful'. When you are not, there is no success, no failure. Success is an ego-projection. Failure is when that projection does not succeed and your ego feels hurt.\nA buddha knows no success, no failure. He simply knows one thing: his awareness. And that awareness has always been there, there is no question of success. Even if he had slept a few lives more it would have remained there. Asleep or awake, it is always there.\nIf you are asleep you may be dreaming a thousand and one things; if you are awake those dreams disappear. So the only difference is that the sleeping person dreams, and the person of\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8316","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">11 Emptying</h1><div class=post-meta>40 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8316 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

recognized as an enlightened man, but this is only his ambition, his
greed; it is not his experience.</p><p>Whenever he quotes some enlightened person, the quotation has great
significance. But when he himself comments on the quotation, those
commentaries are just crap. He uses all great words, but the words
coming from an intellectual don't carry the meaning -- the same meaning
-- as they carry when coming out of an enlightened being. And you will
see his unconscious continually making sarcastic remarks, sometimes so
ugly and condemnable that one cannot think that this man has even begun

sleep. He is clever and cunning. He can manage to befool people who are

THE BAMBOO CHAIR AND REED CUSHION.</p><p><br></p><p>He cannot say directly, "Don't forget meditation." The word
'meditation' somehow hurts all intellectuals, because it is something
beyond the grasp of the intellect. They want to be on the top, and
suddenly they feel that there is something more beyond their grasp. So
rather than simply using the word 'meditation', he says, "Don't forget
the business of the bamboo chair and reed cushion."</p><p>He may think he is being very clever, but it is just his unconscious
showing itself -- its antagonism for meditation. He is not a man of
meditation at all.</p><p><br></p><p>USUALLY (TO MEDITATE) YOU SET YOUR MIND ON A STILL CONCENTRATION
POINT ...</p><p>That is absolutely wrong! That's why I say the man is not a man of
meditation. Concentration is not meditation; concentration is a faculty
of the mind. Mind concentrates;</p><p>meditation is the absence of mind. Mind cannot do anything about
meditation. It simply does</p><p>not know meditation, and there is no intrinsic possibility for the
mind ever to come in contact with meditation. Just as I said before,
darkness cannot come in contact with light because darkness is only an
absence -- so is the mind.</p><p>Mind is the absence of meditation.</p><p>The moment meditation arises in you, mind is found nowhere.</p><p>A Sufi mystic, Junnaid, who himself finally became a great master,
was with his old master. One day, early in the morning, the master said,
"Just look outside to see if it is still dark."</p><p>So Junnaid said, "Okay," and he took the lamp.</p><p>He was going out when the master said, "Wait! If you take the lamp
with you, how are you going to find out whether it is dark or not? Leave
the lamp here."</p><p>Junnaid was only in his disciplehood. He said, "If you say so I will
leave it, but without a lamp how can I see whether it is dark or not? A
little light is needed to see anything." That is true about everything
else, but not about darkness. If you go with a lamp into the house
searching for darkness, you will not find it. The same is true about
mind and meditation.</p><p>Ta Hui thinks meditation is to set your mind on a still concentration
point. A concentration point is within the capacity of mind; it has its
utility. The whole of scientific work comes out of concentration of the
mind, focusing the mind, not allowing it to move anywhere, staying only
on a single point.</p><p>In the ancient story of Mahabharata -- the great Indian war that
happened five thousand years ago -- there was a famous archer,
Dronacharya. All the princes used to come to learn archery from him. His
most intimate disciple was Arjuna, whose concentration was the reason
for this intimacy, because archery depends on concentration.</p><p>One day Dronacharya was examining his disciples. He asked one
disciple, Yudhishthira, Arjuna's eldest brother ... Dronacharya had hung
a dead bird on a tree, and the dead bird's right eye was the target. He
told Yudhishthira -- he was the first, being the eldest -- "Take the bow
and the arrow, but before you shoot, I have to ask you something."</p><p>He became ready with his bow and arrow, and Dronacharya asked him,
"What are you seeing?"</p><p>He said, "I see everything -- all the trees, all the birds."</p><p>The second man was called in and asked, "What are you seeing?" He
said, "I can see only the bird."</p><p>The third man was Arjuna. Dronacharya asked him, "What are you
seeing?" Arjuna said, "Only the right eye of the bird."</p><p>Then Dronacharya told all three to shoot their arrows. Yudhishthira's
arrow went so far off ... you cannot even say it missed -- the distance
between his arrow and the bird was so big. The second man's was a little
closer, but still did not reach the right eye -- it hit the bird. But
Arjuna's arrow hit exactly the right eye of the bird. And the right eye
of the bird on a faraway tree is such a small spot ...</p><p>But Dronacharya said, "Just your answers had given me a sense of who
was going to hit the target. If you see so many trees, you are not
focused. If you see only the bird you are more focused, but still you
are not focused on the right eye. The whole bird is a big thing in
comparison to the right eye. But when Arjuna said, 'I can't see anything
else except the right eye,' then it was certain that his arrow was going
to reach the target."</p><p>In science, in archery, in other arts, concentration may be of great
use -- but it is not meditation. And this is the point that justifies my
continuous insistence that Ta Hui is an intellectual: he has no idea
even what meditation is.</p><p>Meditation is going beyond the mind. It has nothing to do with the
mind -- except going beyond it. It is not a faculty of the mind, it is
transcendental to mind. When you can see</p><p>without the mind in between you and existence, you are in meditation.
It is not concentration. It is utterly silent. It is not focusing ... it
is absolutely unfocused awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO USE IT RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HUBBUB.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the problem with the man -- he has collected from every
source, without knowing whether those statements connect with each other
or not.</p><p>Concentration cannot be practiced in the midst of the hubbub;
concentration needs a space where you are not disturbed by anything.
That's why the people who believe in concentration have left the world
and gone to the mountains, to the caves, to the desert, where there is
nothing to distract them. They can just put their minds on Jesus Christ
or Gautam Buddha or Krishna ... and there is nothing else.</p><p>The desert has been one of the most practical places for
concentration; it is even better than the mountains, because in the
mountains there is so much to see -- the birds are there, the animals
are there, the trees are there, beautiful peaks with snow are there --
there are many possibilities for distraction. But in a desert, as far as
you can see there is only desert, and desert ...</p><p>But meditation can be possible even in the marketplace, because it
does not have to concentrate on anything. Meditation cannot be
disturbed, it is all-inclusive. Concentration is exclusive; it excludes
everything and just keeps the mind on one point.</p><p>Meditation is all-inclusive. The car passes ... the mind in
meditation is fully aware of the horn. The birds start singing ... the
mind is fully aware of their singing. There is no question of
distraction; nothing distracts. Everything -- the mind is no longer
there -- is simply watched. You are only aware that there is a horn, a
car is passing by -- but it is not a distraction.</p><p>Distraction comes only when you are trying to concentrate, then
anything -- a small ant crawling up your leg -- will be enough to
distract you. But when you are in meditation, you simply know that the
ant is crawling up your leg. If you like it, you allow it; if you don't
like it, you throw it away. But there is no distraction -- your silence
remains unscratched. How can the noises on the street distract you? You
simply listen to them -- they don't make any impact on you. They come
and go, and you remain just a witness.</p><p>Meditation is possible in the hubbub of a marketplace ... Ta Hui has
heard some man of meditation talking, but he has never meditated
himself; all that he knows is concentration of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>VIMALKIRTI SAID, "IT IS LIKE THIS: THE HIGH PLATEAU DOES NOT PRODUCE
LOTUS FLOWERS; IT IS THE MIRE OF THE LOW SWAMPLANDS THAT PRODUCES THESE
FLOWERS."</p><p><br></p><p>He is quoting Vimalkirti, but he is not commenting on it. He is just
throwing names in to decorate his sutras. I don't think he has
understood what Vimalkirti means.</p><p>Vimalkirti was one of the strangest people who came in contact with
Gautam Buddha. He never became a sannyasin -- he remained a layman --
but even Gautam Buddha respected him.</p><p>He used to come to listen to Gautam Buddha, and he was meditating,
but he could not see that there was any need to renounce the world and
become a sannyasin and a beggar. He was such a genius that he was the
first layman to become enlightened. The first sannyasin to become
enlightened was Manjushri, and the first layman to become enlightened
was Vimalkirti.</p><p>But Vimalkirti was a very strange person. For a few days he had not
come, and Buddha was concerned ... is he sick, or is there some trouble?
-- why is he not coming? So he asked that one of his disciples should
offer to go to Vimalkirti -- he lived in the city -- to enquire about
his health and why he is not coming.</p><p>But out of ten thousand sannyasins, nobody wanted to go, for the
simple reason that even to say hello to Vimalkirti was dangerous! He
would make it a point of great discussion -- "To whom are you saying
hello? Are you certain I am not a dream? Can you give me any evidence
that I am not a dream? If you see me in a dream, will you recognize that
it is a dream and not reality?"</p><p>He used to put everybody in such a corner -- on any point. If you
didn't say anything and you simply tried to avoid him, he would say,
"Hey, where are you going? Is there any place to go? The truth is right
here now. Where are you going?" He had tortured almost everybody.</p><p>Finally one disciple said, "I will go. Whatever he does I will take
it easy, but he has to be asked after." When the disciple went he said,
"Gautam Buddha has sent me to enquire about your health. As I came here,
just outside your house, your family said that you are sick."</p><p>Rather than answering him, the sick Vimalkirti said, "Sick? About
whom are you talking? I don't exist at all, how can I be sick? To be
sick you first have to exist -- what do you think? I have disappeared
long ago in my meditations. So just go back and tell Gautam Buddha,
'Vimalkirti is no more -- there is no question of sickness or
health.'"</p><p>The disciple was very much disturbed, because if he tells Gautam
Buddha that Vimalkirti is no more, he will think that perhaps he has
died. So he told Vimalkirti, "This statement can be misunderstood. If I
say simply that Vimalkirti is no more, the obvious meaning will be that
Vimalkirti is dead."</p><p>He said, "That's the right meaning! Vimalkirti is dead. It was a
phony name which disappeared with meditation. When I was born I was not
Vimalkirti, and when I was reborn in meditation I again became nameless,
formless -- it is perfectly right. You can even say that Vimalkirti is
dead."</p><p>The disciple said, "That is too much, because you are alive and I
will be in trouble.</p><p>Tomorrow you may appear before Buddha, and he will ask me, 'What were
you saying?'"</p><p>And in this way a whole sutra, Vimalkirti's Hridaya Sutra, has
developed between the disciple and Vimalkirti. He is so clear that you
cannot catch hold of him, you cannot grasp him. He is so vast that
whatever you say, you are immediately caught.</p><p>Quoting from Vimalkirti is just to decorate Ta Hui's sutras, but he
does not comment on it.</p><p>Perhaps he does not understand it either.</p><p><br></p><p>VIMALKIRTI SAID, "IT IS LIKE THIS: THE HIGH PLATEAU DOES NOT PRODUCE
LOTUS FLOWERS; IT IS THE MIRE OF THE LOW SWAMPLANDS THAT PRODUCES THESE
FLOWERS."</p><p>The lotus comes out of mud, out of swamplands. It is perhaps the best
flower -- the biggest flower, the most fragrant and the most delicate.
No other flower can be compared with it, yet it is born out of mud.</p><p>Vimalkirti is saying, "Don't be worried about man's ignorance, his
anger, his greed, his lust, his desire for power and for money, his
attachment to things, his aggressiveness, his violence ... Don't be
worried -- this is the mud out of which the lotus of enlightenment
arises. Accept it all, because the lotus flower cannot be born on high
land, on a plateau. So you should be grateful to all your ignorance, all
your anger, all your greed, your sex ..."</p><p>Whatever the religions have been condemning, Vimalkirti is saying be
grateful to it because it is only out of this that the buddha is born,
that the lotus flower comes out. But Ta Hui does not make any comment on
it. This is strange. If you are not going to make any comment, then
there is no need to quote. On the contrary, he goes on speaking in a
very ugly way. THE OLD BARBARIAN ... he calls Gautam Buddha "the old
barbarian."</p><p>The Chinese, just like everybody else, think that they are the most
cultured people. When Marco Polo reached China, he wrote in his
diary:</p><p>"These people cannot be thought of as human beings. They look like
human beings but they are a lower species. They eat snakes, they eat
dogs, there is nothing that they will leave; they eat everything! They
look very strange, and their ideas are very strange. With high
cheekbones they are ugly, but they think high cheekbones are immensely
beautiful. They have only a few hairs in their beards, you can count
them -- at the most twelve! Their mustaches also have very few hairs,
which can be counted on the fingers. Very strange people! It seems they
are on the way to becoming human beings."</p><p>The emperor of China, who invited Marco Polo to his court, told his
historian to write about him, "We have heard that these people believe
that man has come from the monkeys. We could not believe it because we
had not seen these people" -- Marco Polo was the first westerner to
visit China. The emperor continued, "But they are perfectly right! As
far as they are concerned, monkeys are their forefathers. They look like
monkeys."</p><p>But this is the situation everywhere. Indians think they are the
purest Aryans, the Germans think they are the purest Aryans. The word
arya is Sanskrit -- it means 'the highest'. Everybody thinks ... But to
use the word 'barbarian' for Gautam Buddha -- and that, too, by a man
who pretends to be his disciple -- is simply inconceivable. If Gautam
Buddha is a barbarian, then in the whole world nobody has ever been a
cultured man.</p><p>Even now Buddha is the most cultured man, the most graceful. His
beauty is such that Friedrich Nietzsche condemned him because of his
grace and his beauty. He looked feminine to Nietzsche, because his idea
of a real man was to be strong and to be made of steel ... grace,
beauty? -- those are feminine qualities.</p><p>Nietzsche condemned Gautam Buddha: "I cannot believe in his
teachings. They are dangerous, they will turn the whole world into a
feminine world. I want man to keep his manhood and not to be impressed
by people like Gautam Buddha."</p><p>Nietzsche loved the warrior -- that was his ideal for every man -- as
sharp as the blade of the sword, as hard as steel, neither worried about
killing, nor worried about being killed; these are just manly games.</p><p>Gautam Buddha is teaching nonviolence -- don't kill anybody. He is
teaching compassion, he is teaching love, and he is teaching meditation
-- which will make you graceful, loving,</p><p>compassionate, but your manhood will disappear. You may become a
roseflower, but you will not be a sword.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche may be wrong but his esteem is right. He cannot
call Gautam Buddha a barbarian. Perhaps there is no other man who was so
cultured as Gautam Buddha. But Ta Hui is calling him, "the old
barbarian."</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA SAID, "TRUE THUSNESS DOES NOT KEEP TO ITS OWN NATURE, BUT
ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGS ABOUT ALL PHENOMENAL THINGS."</p><p><br></p><p>The quotation is right. Buddha is saying true thusness is always
ready to change with the circumstances. It has no resistance, because
resistance means ego, resistance means, "I have my own will. I will go
on my path."</p><p>To accept life in its totality, as it is, means to relax and let life
take charge of you; then wherever it takes you, go with it. This is his
most fundamental teaching of suchness or thusness.</p><p>Such a man is always at peace. Whatever happens makes no problem for
him; he simply goes with it with total willingness. Not only does he
have no resistance, on the other hand he welcomes life in whatever form
it comes. He welcomes death -- even death cannot disturb him. There is
nothing that can disturb him because he goes with everything, allows it
...</p><p>He is just like a leaf dropping from the tree. If the wind takes it
up, it goes up; if the wind takes it to the north, it goes to the north;
if the wind takes it to the south, it goes to the south; if the wind
drops it on the ground, it rests on the ground. It does not say to the
wind, "This is very contradictory -- you just started going north, and
now you have started going south. I don't want to go south -- I am
destined for the north." No, the leaf has no destination of its own.</p><p>Existence has its own destination, and the man of meditation makes
existence's destination his own destination. He makes no separation at
all. If existence feels it is time for death, then it is time for death.
His ability to accept is total. Such a man cannot be in pain, in agony,
in misery, in anguish -- he has cut the very root of all these
things.</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE YOU HAVE ACHIEVED PEACEFUL STILLNESS OF BODY AND MIND, YOU MUST
MAKE EARNEST EFFORT.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these are Ta Hui's words. Whenever he quotes, that quotation is
great. But whenever he comes to his own understanding, he falls very
low. He says, "Once you have achieved peaceful stillness of body and
mind ..."</p><p>In the first place, a man like Gautam Buddha will not use the word
'achievement', because it is not an achievement -- it is only a
discovery. Secondly, he will not say "peaceful stillness of body and
mind." He will say "transcendence of body and mind" -- only then can you
be still. Body and mind cannot be still by their very nature. Thirdly,
he says, "You must make earnest effort." The meditator does not make any
effort.</p><p>The whole idea of Gautam Buddha about meditation is so unique and so
tremendously beautiful that it has been a problem for other religions to
understand it -- because every religion thinks earnest effort is needed.
But Gautam Buddha's idea is beautifully represented by Basho's haiku:
"Sitting silently, doing nothing ... the spring comes and the grass
grows by itself." There is no question of any effort; you are simply
sitting, doing nothing ...</p><p>If you want to do something, effort is needed. But if you are in a
state of non-doing, no effort is needed ... and if, for non-doing,
effort is needed, what kind of non-doing will it be? Effort is doing,
and out of doing, you cannot create non-doing. You have to renounce
doing.</p><p>Sitting silently, doing nothing ... the spring comes. It is not your
effort that brings the spring; it comes, in its turn. It has always been
coming. And when the spring comes, you don't have to pull the grass and
make earnest effort so that it grows -- it grows on its own accord. The
grass grows by itself ...</p><p>Nobody except Buddha has come to this tremendous discovery, that
meditation is a very simple phenomenon. You just relax -- but not the
American way! I cannot forgive a man who has written a book, YOU MUST
RELAX! That 'must' destroys the whole idea of relaxation, but that is
the American idea -- "you must relax." And the book has sold very well,
because everybody wants to relax. It is well-written, but the person
does not know anything about relaxation. It cannot be a must.</p><p>Relaxation has to be a very simple understanding ... no effort, no
doing -- you just sit silently, and let your body relax. There is
nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to achieve, so there is no point
in being tense -- because you have it already within you. Relaxation
becomes possible without any effort. You are sitting where you want to
reach, so what is the point of making any effort? You have always been
in the space where you want to be, you just have not looked inwards. No
achievement, no longing, no desire, nowhere else to go ... relaxation
comes on its own.</p><p>A relaxation which has been managed is not much of a relaxation.
There is bound to be a subtle tension around it -- you are holding it.
You can sit silently, still, but deep down you are very tense, you are
holding yourself still -- no movement. This is not stillness, this is
fake. Stillness should be natural. And how can it be natural?</p><p>Buddha's whole philosophy gives you the right situation in which it
happens on its own accord. There is nothing to achieve -- there is no
God, there is no heaven, there is no hell. All that you need is already
given to you, you have it within you. You are not a sinner that has to
pray continuously to get rid of your sins. You are as pure as Buddha
himself. The only difference -- and that does not make you inferior in
any way -- is that you are not aware of it.</p><p>You have the Kohinoor -- the most precious diamond -- within you, but
you are not aware of it. Buddha is aware of it.</p><p>So all that needs to happen is sitting silently, waiting for the
spring, waiting for the right moment ... when your relaxation comes to
its highest peak, when your silence becomes absolute, the spring has
come. And "the grass grows by itself" is only a symbol. It is a symbol
that you, your potential, starts growing on its own, spontaneously. It
is a natural phenomenon, it is an intrinsic capacity -- you don't have
to do anything.</p><p>So when Ta Hui says you must make earnest effort, he misses
completely the whole new message of Gautam Buddha.</p><p>DO NOT IMMEDIATELY SETTLE DOWN IN PEACEFUL STILLNESS. IN THE
TEACHINGS THIS IS CALLED "THE DEEP PIT OF LIBERATION."</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever he quotes, because the quotation is not his, he is right.
But whenever he says anything of his own, he is wrong. Now this is
certainly right -- it is a quotation.</p><p>"The deep pit of liberation" -- there is a danger for all seekers,
for all people of the path, that you may settle for a small treasure.
Just a little silence, a little relaxation, a little peace, and you may
think you have come home. This they call the "deep pit of liberation."
You have settled long before you have blossomed.</p><p>So one has to be alert not to settle anywhere. Just go on growing --
allow your potential to grow. Don't start feeling, "I have come, I have
arrived." Your potential is immense, and your treasure is
incalculable.</p><p>So go on and on and on ... and you will find more and more peace,
more profound spaces, more juicy experiences. Your desert-like life you
will find slowly turning into a green beautiful garden. You will find
many, many flowers blossoming within you. Just go on ... there is no end
to your growth.</p><p>One never comes to the end of one's growth. It is always coming
closer -- but just coming closer. You cannot come to the end of the road
because existence is eternal, and you are one with existence. Your
journey, your pilgrimage, is also to be eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF TURN FREELY -- now these are Ta Hui's words --
LIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON THE WATER, INDEPENDENT AND FREE ...</p><p><br></p><p>The gourd is not independent and is not free! The gourd cannot go
against the current -- how can it go? It is simply moving with the
current. Wherever the river is going, it is going -- what kind of
independence is this? The gourd wants to stop at some place; it cannot,
because the river is continuously moving. What kind of freedom is
this?</p><p>No, this example is absolutely wrong. You can say the gourd is
relaxed, you can say the gourd is no longer resistant, you can say the
gourd has total acceptance -- wherever the river takes it. But you
cannot say that it is independent and free. That would be an absolutely
absurd idea. What independence can it have? It cannot go against the
current, it cannot stop when it wants ... If the river moves to the
south, it has to move to the south; it cannot say, "No, I don't want to
go south." It is neither free nor independent.</p><p>He must have heard about the gourd ... that a man should relax just
like a gourd in the river. It is immensely graceful because there is no
resistance, no tension, no fight. In fact, it has become almost one with
the river. It has no ideas different from the river, it has no
intentions different from the river, it has nothing of what you call
'will power'. It has surrendered completely to the river. It has great
peace and silence, acceptance, thusness.</p><p>This example of the gourd has been used by Buddha for thusness, for
suchness, for tathata.</p><p>But it is not used for freedom and independence.</p><p>... NOT SUBJECT TO RESTRAINTS, ENTERING PURITY AND IMPURITY WITHOUT
BEING OBSTRUCTED OR SINKING DOWN.</p><p><br></p><p>But this does not show its independence! When the river moves into
impurity, the gourd has to move in impurity. When the river moves in
pure waters, the gourd has to move in pure waters.</p><p>It simply shows that Ta Hui has not understood the idea of
surrendering yourself to nature totally. In that surrender, you have
disappeared -- who is going to be independent, and who is going to be
free? That does not mean that you have become a slave, and that does not
mean that you have become dependent. These are the subtleties of the
experience of surrender.</p><p>You have become one with existence. You are neither dependent nor
independent -- you are no more. And YOU have been the problem ... so
now, because you are no more, there is no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>ONLY THEN DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE SCHOOL OF THE
PATCHROBED MONKS.</p><p><br></p><p>No, he is not right.</p><p>And again he is using sarcastic remarks ... patchrobed monks. Buddha
used to say to his disciples, "People throw out clothes when they are
useless or rotten or have been used too much. Collect those pieces of
cloth and make patchrobes; just put those pieces of cloth together and
make a robe. That way you will not be a burden on people for your
robes."</p><p>It was a great idea in itself. Buddha's whole effort was that his
people should not be a burden and parasite on poor people, so he had
taken every care. "You should not take your food from one house, you
should take your food from five houses -- just a small piece from one
house, another small piece from another house -- so you are not a
burden.</p><p>"You should not remain longer than three days in one place; you
should not ask for food from the same house while you are three days in
the town; and you should collect thrown-away robes, clothes. And when
the days of rain come, and for four months you cannot move and you have
to stay in one place, then make patchrobes for yourself, for other
sannyasins. You have enough time. So for clothes you are not dependent
at all and for food your burden is negligible."</p><p>In fact, everybody enjoyed giving some food. Even in the poorest
family, if a guest suddenly comes he can be accommodated. And he was not
being dependent on one family but five families, and only one meal a
day. So Buddha had minimized as much as possible the burden on the
people, and people rejoiced without any reluctance. They wanted to share
something with the monks, and this much they could manage.</p><p>Sometimes people used to give clothes to the monks, and Buddha had
said that, "If somebody gives you a cloth you should cut it in pieces,
because it should not be that some monks are using patchrobes and some
monks are using clothes which are not patched. That will create
unnecessary competitiveness."</p><p>He was very careful to create a commune of equals, without any
conflict -- and he succeeded in it. There was no conflict. Even the
newest clothes were cut down and patched again, so they looked the same
as anybody else's. But Ta Hui's reference to the school of the
'patchrobed' is sarcastic, it is not respectful.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU JUST MANAGE TO CRADLE THE UNCRYING CHILD IN YOUR ARMS, WHAT IS
THE USE?</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying that just being silent -- a small silence, a small peace
-- is not much use. It is just like cradling the uncrying child in your
arms -- what is the use? About that he is right.</p><p>You should go to the profoundest ecstasy. Silence is only the
beginning. Stillness is only the beginning, not the end.</p><p><br></p><p>LIN CHI SAID, "IF YOU CAN PUT TO REST THE MIND THAT FRANTICALLY SEEKS
FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, YOU WILL BE NO DIFFERENT FROM OLD SHAKYAMUNI
BUDDHA." HE WAS NOT FOOLING PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>Lin Chi's statement is clear: If you can put to rest the mind that
frantically seeks from moment to moment, you will be no different from
old Shakyamuni Buddha.</p><p>The only difference between you and the awakened one is that you go
on being dominated by the frantic mind, which is continuously restless.
Buddha has overcome it; he has put his mind to rest. This is the only
difference.</p><p>But Lin Chi is not being sarcastic -- he was a great master. He is
saying, "the old Shakyamuni Buddha" -- shakya is his clan; hence he is
called shakyamuni, the man from the Shakya clan who became utterly
silent.</p><p>In fact, Ta Hui needed a master like Lin Chi. He says that Lin Chi
was not fooling people. Why is he saying that? Perhaps unconsciously he
knows that he is fooling people. He needed a man like Lin Chi. Lin Chi
was the most strange master. I have told you about him ... he used to
hit people, he used to beat his disciples, for no reason at all. And
once he threw a disciple from the window of a two story building and
then jumped on top of him. Sitting on his chest he asked him, "Got it?"
And the strangest thing is that the disciple said, "Yes, sir!" because
this was so surprising ...</p><p>Lin Chi had been beating him -- to that he had become accustomed. He
knew that whenever he goes, he will get a good beating. But even to be
beaten by a man like Lin Chi ... he was so beautiful, so loving. He was
beating out of love; there was no anger in it. He was trying in every
way to wake him up.</p><p>But beating had become known and familiar. That's why Lin Chi had to
throw him out of the window -- to shock him completely: "This is going
too far!" Then when he saw Lin Chi coming behind him, his mind must have
stopped! And sitting on his chest, Lin Chi asked "Got it?"</p><p>In that moment the disciple must have been so quiet ... the mind
cannot figure out what is happening, so the mind has to be at rest in
such a moment. And the master's eyes, and his</p><p>grace, and his words, "Got it?" The answer came not from his mind,
but from his very being. He said, "Yes, sir."</p><p>Ta Hui needed a man like Lin Chi. Perhaps then he may have come to a
state of no-mind, even for a single moment. And that would have changed
his whole approach from intellectual to meditative.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN BODHISATTVAS OF THE SEVENTH STAGE SEEK BUDDHA- KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT
THEIR MINDS BEING SATISFIED: THEREFORE IT IS CALLED "AFFLICTION." REALLY
THERE IS NO WAY TO MANAGE: IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY THE SLIGHTEST
EXTERNAL MEASURE.</p><p><br></p><p>Again it is a quotation, and the quotation is right: Really there is
no way to manage, because you cannot do anything for realization -- so
naturally, there is no way to manage.</p><p>Or in other words: if you drop managing, if you drop doing, if you
drop effort, it happens on its own accord. But you cannot manage it, you
cannot manage to be a buddha. If you manage to be a buddha it will only
be a hypocrisy; you will be only an actor and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CERTAIN LAYMAN, HSU, WHO WAS ABLE TO
FIND AN OPENING; HE SENT ME A LETTER EXPRESSING HIS UNDERSTANDING, THAT
SAID ...</p><p><br></p><p>Here you will see that an ordinary layman has come to a great
understanding of truth. The answer that Ta Hui sends him is so ordinary
and irrelevant that it will make it clear to you that there is no
question of comparing him with any Zen master. He is not even capable of
understanding the experience that has happened to a layman, an ordinary
man, and the way that man has expressed it.</p><p>Layman Hsu sent Ta Hui a letter, and said in the letter,</p><p><br></p><p>"EMPTY AND OPEN IN MY DAILY ACTIVITIES, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING
OPPOSING ME; FINALLY I REALIZE THAT ALL THINGS IN THE THREE WORLDS ARE
FUNDAMENTALLY NONEXISTENT. TRULY THIS IS PEACE AND HAPPINESS, JOYFUL
LIVELINESS, HAVING CAST IT ALL AWAY." ACCORDINGLY I INSTRUCTED HIM WITH
A VERSE.</p><p><br></p><p>Hsu does not need any instruction from Ta Hui, but Ta Hui is
pretending to be a great teacher.</p><p>Hsu has expressed his experience, which is perfectly in tune with
Gautam Buddha and the Zen masters. The instruction that Ta Hui has sent
is absolutely irrelevant. First he says, don't be fond of purity. Now in
the letter the poor man has not said anything about purity! Don't be
fond of purity: purity makes people weary. don't be fond of joyful
liveliness ... Hsu has not</p><p>said anything about that. He has simply said that a joyful liveliness
has happened to him; he has not said that he is fond of it.</p><p>Joyful liveliness makes people crazy. Ta Hui's instruction is
dangerous ... because he was thought to be a great Zen master, accepted
by the emperor. The poor man must have been disturbed by the instruction
he was sent.</p><p><br></p><p>AS WATER CONFORMS TO THE VESSEL, IT ACCORDINGLY BECOMES SQUARE OR
ROUND, SHORT OR LONG. AS FOR CASTING AWAY OR NOT CASTING AWAY, PLEASE
THINK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY.</p><p><br></p><p>He does not need the word 'think'.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE WORLDS AND MYRIAD THINGS ARE NO REFUGE -- WHERE IS THERE
ANY HOME?</p><p><br></p><p>Hsu has not talked about all these things in which Hui is instructing
him.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU ARE JUST THUS, THIS IS A GREAT CONTRADICTION. THIS IS TO
INFORM LAYMAN HSU THAT HIS OWN KIN ARE CREATING DISASTER -- OPEN WIDE
THE EYE OF THE THOUSAND SAGES, AND DO NOT KEEP PRAYING FOR RELIEF.</p><p>He is not praying for relief, he is not disturbed by anything, he is
not in any contradiction, he is not seeking any refuge ...! I would like
to read Hsu's words again, so you can see how irrelevant is the
instruction. But just to be the teacher, Ta Hui has to say something
...</p><p>Ta Hui has not even understood the layman's statement: "Empty and
open in my daily activities, there is not a single thing opposing me."
When you are empty and open, how can anything oppose you? Opposition
comes when you are there with a will, with a certain ego, with a certain
desire -- then there is opposition. But if you are empty and open,
naturally there is no opposition possible.</p><p><br></p><p>"FINALLY I REALIZE THAT ALL THINGS IN THE THREE WORLDS ARE
FUNDAMENTALLY NONEXISTENT."</p><p><br></p><p>It has to be understood what, in the heritage of Gautam Buddha, the
word 'nonexistent' means. It simply means nothing is stable, everything
is changing.</p><p>Buddha's definition of the existent is "that which always remains the
same." There is only one thing that is existent, and that is the
witnessing self, the witnessing consciousness. It remains always the
same ... past, present, future, from eternity to eternity, it is the
same. This is the only existent thing. Everything else changes; every
moment it is changing, and that which is changing is nonexistent. It
does not mean that it is not there; it simply means that</p><p>while you are seeing it, it is already changing. While you are
listening to me, you are already changing -- your death is coming
closer.</p><p>This world is ephemeral. The word 'nonexistent' in Buddha's
philosophy simply means "that which is ephemeral, that which goes on
changing" -- you cannot rely on it. The only thing you can rely on is
your witnessing consciousness. It never changes. It is the very center
of the cyclone. But about this, in his great instruction, Ta Hui does
not say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>"TRULY THIS IS PEACE AND HAPPINESS, JOYFUL LIVELINESS. HAVING CAST IT
ALL AWAY."</p><p><br></p><p>Hsu is not saying, "I am fond of these things" -- that, "I desire
them." He is saying, "I have found them, they are there." And Ta Hui's
instruction is absolutely out of place: don't be fond of purity -- I am
amazed that he cannot see that what he is saying has no reference to the
layman's letter --</p><p><br></p><p>PURITY MAKES PEOPLE WEARY. DON'T BE FOND OF JOYFUL LIVELINESS: JOYFUL
LIVELINESS MAKES PEOPLE CRAZY. AS WATER CONFORMS TO THE VESSEL, IT
ACCORDINGLY BECOMES SQUARE OR ROUND, SHORT OR LONG. AS FOR CASTING AWAY
OR NOT CASTING AWAY, PLEASE THINK IT OVER MORE CAREFULLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking is a very low activity; it is of the mind. Meditation is the
highest within you; it is beyond mind. The layman has touched something
beyond mind, and Ta Hui is dragging him down by saying, please think it
over more carefully. The three worlds and myriad things are no refuge --
where is there any home? But the poor fellow has not asked about the
home or any refuge.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU ARE JUST THUS, THIS IS A GREAT CONTRADICTION.</p><p><br></p><p>Hsu has not said that he is just thus! He is simply saying that this
is his awareness, his consciousness. He can see it, he is aware of his
emptiness, his openness. And he has found that since the moment he
became empty and open, not a single thing opposes him.</p><p>"And as I have entered into this emptiness and openness, I realized
that all things in the three worlds are fundamentally nonexistent.
Truly, this is peace and happiness, joyful liveliness." He is simply
stating the experience of his meditation.</p><p>Ta Hui has not been able to understand it; his instruction is
absolute nonsense. Finally he says, "and do not keep praying for
relief." Anybody can see that he is saying things just to pose as a
great instructor.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF A STUDENT OF THE PATH ...</p><p>Ta Hui does not understand the difference between a student, a
disciple, and a devotee.</p><p>The student is never on the path.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF A STUDENT OF THE PATH, TO EMPTY OBJECTS IS
EASY BUT TO EMPTY MIND IS HARD.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems to be his own experience; otherwise to empty the mind is the
simplest thing. A thing is hard when it needs great effort to do it, but
to empty the mind needs no effort at all. How can it be hard?</p><p><br></p><p>IF OBJECTS ARE EMPTY BUT MIND IS NOT EMPTY, MIND WILL BE OVERCOME BY
OBJECTS.</p><p>JUST EMPTY THE MIND, AND OBJECTS WILL BE EMPTY OF THEMSELVES. IF THE
MIND IS ALREADY EMPTIED, BUT THEN YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT WISHING TO
EMPTY ITS OBJECTS, THIS MEANS THAT THIS MIND IS NOT YET EMPTY AND IS
AGAIN CARRIED AWAY BY OBJECTS. IF THIS SICKNESS IS NOT DONE AWAY WITH,
THERE IS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF BIRTH AND DEATH.</p><p>HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE VERSE WHICH LAYMAN P'ANG PRESENTED TO MA
TSU?</p><p>IN THE TEN DIRECTIONS, THE SAME CONGREGATION: EACH AND EVERY ONE
STUDIES NON-DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui is not clear anywhere that a seeker does not study. Only a
student studies. A seeker absorbs, drinks. He absorbs the presence of
the master, he allows the master's energy to transform his energy. The
student collects information; the seeker is not interested in
information -- his only interest is transformation. These are totally
different things.</p><p>Each and everyone studies non-doing. How can you study non-doing?
Either you can be in the state of non-doing, or you cannot be. But
studying is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE BUDDHAS ARE CHOSEN: MINDS EMPTY, THEY RETURN
SUCCESSFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha will not use the word 'successful'. When you are not,
there is no success, no failure. Success is an ego-projection. Failure
is when that projection does not succeed and your ego feels hurt.</p><p>A buddha knows no success, no failure. He simply knows one thing: his
awareness. And that awareness has always been there, there is no
question of success. Even if he had slept a few lives more it would have
remained there. Asleep or awake, it is always there.</p><p>If you are asleep you may be dreaming a thousand and one things; if
you are awake those dreams disappear. So the only difference is that the
sleeping person dreams, and the person of</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The older master exclaimed, \"You must be someone who's come again!\"\nYuan Wu told Ta Hhui, \"It wasn't easy for you to get to this stage -- too bad that having died, you are unable to come back to life. Without a doubt, words and phrases are a great disease, but haven't you seen the saying\nHANGING FROM A CLIFF, LET GO --\nAND AGREE TO ACCEPT THE EXPERIENCE. AFTER ANNIHILATION, COME BACK TO LIFE -- I COULDN'T DECEIVE YOU.\"\nTa Hui was given a purple robe and the name \"Buddha Sun\" as a sign of imperial honor. Emperor Hsiao Tsung bestowed the title \"Ch'an master of great wisdom\" from which the name of Ta Hui comes.\nIt was eleven sixty-three, on the ninth day of the eighth month, after showing signs of illness, when Ta Hui told the congregation of monks, nuns, and lay-people, \"Tomorrow I'm going.\" Towards the pre-dawn hours, his attendant asked Ta Hui for a verse. In a serious voice Ta Hui said, \"Without a verse, I couldn't die.\" He took up the brush and wrote:\nBIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE THAT'S THE FUSS?\nthen he let go of the writing brush and passed on.\n1\nClear the mind\n15 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO,\nCLEAR THE MIND (TO LI HSIEN-CH'EN)\nBUDDHA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR MIND AS CLEAR AS EMPTY SPACE, AND LEAVE FALSE THINKING AND ALL GRASPING FAR BEHIND, CAUSING YOUR MIND TO BE UNOBSTRUCTED WHEREVER IT MAY TURN. THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD IS NOT SOME EXTERNAL WORLD, WHERE THERE IS A FORMAL \"BUDDHA\": IT'S THE REALM OF THE WISDOM OF A SELF-AWAKENED SAGE.\nONCE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW THIS REALM, YOU DO NOT NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN IT. YOU MUST CLEAR AWAY THE STAINS OF AFFLICTIONS FROM ALIEN SENSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON YOUR MIND SINCE BEGINNINGLESS TIME, SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS BROAD AND OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE, DETACHED FROM ALL THE CLINGING OF THE DISCRIMINATING INTELLECT, AND YOUR FALSE, UNREAL, VAIN THOUGHTS TOO ARE LIKE EMPTY SPACE. THEN THIS WONDROUS, EFFORTLESS MIND WILL BE UNIMPEDED WHEREVER IT GOES.\nMINDLESSNESS (TO HUNG PO-CH'ONG)\nAN ANCIENT WORTHY HAD A SAYING: \"TO LOOK FOR THE OX, ONE MUST SEEK OUT ITS TRACKS. TO STUDY THE PATH, SEEK OUT MINDLESSNESS. WHERE THE TRACKS ARE, SO MUST THE OX BE.\" THE PATH OF MINDLESSNESS IS EASY TO SEEK OUT. SO-CALLED MINDLESSNESS IS NOT BEING INERT AND UNKNOWING LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE; IT MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED AND IMPERTURBABLE WHEN IN CONTACT WITH SITUATIONS AND MEETING CIRCUMSTANCES; THAT IT DOES NOT CLING TO ANYTHING, BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES, WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION; WITHOUT BEING STAINED, YET WITHOUT DWELLING IN THE STAINLESSNESS; VIEWING BODY AND MIND LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS, YET WITHOUT REMAINING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF DREAMS' AND ILLUSIONS' EMPTY NOTHINGNESS.\nONLY WHEN ONE ARRIVES AT A REALM LIKE THIS, CAN IT BE CALLED TRUE MINDLESSNESS. NO, IT'S NOT LIP-SERVICE MINDLESSNESS: IF YOU HAVEN'T ATTAINED TRUE MINDLESSNESS AND JUST GO BY THE VERBAL KIND, HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE PERVERTED CH'AN OF \"SILENT ILLUMINATION\"?\n\"JUST GET TO THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES.\" EMPTYING THIS MIND IS THE ROOT. ONCE YOU GET THE ROOT, THE\nFUNDAMENTAL, THEN ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE AND ALL\nYOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AS YOU RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES, THROUGH SO MANY UPSETS AND DOWNFALLS, WHETHER\nJOYOUS OR ANGRY, GOOD OR BAD, FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE -- THESE ARE ALL TRIVIAL MATTERS, THE BRANCHES. IF YOU CAN BE SPONTANEOUSLY AWARE AND KNOWING AS YOU ARE GOING ALONG WITH CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN THERE IS NEITHER LACK NOR EXCESS.\nThe great Zen teacher Ta Hui comes from the same lineage as Bodhidharma. He was born four hundred years after Bodhidharma had left for the Himalayas, to disappear into the eternal ice, the eternal silence there.\nI have called Ta Hui the great Zen teacher -- not a master ... it has to be explained to you clearly. The master is one who is enlightened. but sometimes it happens that the master may be enlightened, but is not articulate enough to give expression to what he has known. That is a totally different art.\nThe teacher is not enlightened, but he is very articulate. He can say things which the master, although he knows, cannot bring to words. The teacher can say them, although he does not know.\nThe teacher he has heard ... he has lived with enlightened people, he has imbibed their energy, he has been showered by their flowers. He has tasted something transpiring from the enlightened ones, so he has a certainty that something like enlightenment happens, but he has no authority of his own; his authority is borrowed. And if the teacher is a genius, he can almost manage to express things over which masters have faltered, or they have remained silent.\nThe teacher has his own utility. He is more available to the people -- he belongs to the people. The master is on a high sunlit peak. Even if he shouts from there, only echoes reach to the people's ears. But the teacher lives amongst the people, knows their life, knows their language, knows how things should be expressed so they can understand. The master remains committed to his experience, while the teacher is more committed to the people, to spread the message.\nOnce in a while it happens that the master cannot express at all. For example, Ramakrishna was an enlightened man, but utterly uneducated, uncultured, knowing nothing of great literature, knowing nothing of what other enlightened people have said. He experienced the beauty of his inner being, but he was absolutely handicapped as far as conveying it to others. He had to take the support of a man, Vivekananda, who was not enlightened but was a great genius -- very intelligent, rational, logical, intellectual, well-versed, well-educated. He became the mouthpiece of Ramakrishna. He went around the world spreading his message.\nWhatever exists today as Ramakrishna Mission, is completely the work of Vivekananda, but he himself died in utter agony. The agony was more intense because he had been spreading the good news of ecstasy, but inside he was empty. His whole message was only verbal, but he managed it so cleverly that many started thinking of him as enlightened.\nThe same thing happened with Ta Hui. When he was just sixteen years old he was so intelligent ... he left the world, and after one year of preparation he was initiated as a monk, when he was just seventeen. Then he went from master to master, seeking the right enlightened man who could show him the way.\nHe found his master in Yuan Wu. It seems almost the same situation: Yuan Wu knows, but cannot say it. Ta Hui does not know, but can say it. Just living with the master, imbibing\nhis energy, watching his grace -- the way he walks, the way he sits, the way he remains silent ...\nRarely, once in a while, Yuan Wu speaks a word or sentence. His statements are collected in a small book, BLUE CLIFF RECORD, but they are almost impossible to understand. They don't seem to be related to each other, relevant to each other; they look fragmentary. They don't create a system.\nEven though his words were recorded in BLUE CLIFF RECORD, Yuan Wu never addressed the people. On the contrary, he simply asked Ta Hui just to look into the BLUE CLIFF RECORD and express his opinion, say what he thinks of them. He was not certain that he had been able to say what he wanted to say, and whether what he had said conveyed anything or was just a futile exercise. In every case Ta Hui completely comprehended the subtle meaning.\nTHE OLDER MASTER EXCLAIMED, \"YOU MUST BE SOMEONE WHO HAS COME AGAIN!\"\nBy saying this he is saying, \"You must have been born almost enlightened, just a little bit is missing; perhaps you may be able to manage it in this life. But you have understood my expressions perfectly well.\" This was his seal, when he said \"You must be someone who has come again!\" -- you cannot be new. You have been on the path for a long, long time; although you have not achieved the ultimate end, you are very close.\nBut the master could not be deceived just by Ta Hui's understanding of the words, which any intelligent man of great talent like Ta Hui could have done. Yuan Wu again said to Ta Hui, \"It was not easy for you to get to this stage\" -- you have struggled hard -- \"Too bad that having died, you are unable to come back to life.\" This will be clear to you if I refer to Jesus who says, \"Unless you are born again, you will not understand the truth.\"\nThere are two parts of the path. The first part is to let your ego die. It is strenuous, arduous, difficult, because you know only your ego, you don't know your authentic self. You are jumping into an abyss, not knowing whether you will survive or not; THAT Ta Hui has done. But the second part -- of resurrection, of giving birth to your new individuality, or your authentic being -- has not happened.\n\"IT WAS NOT EASY FOR YOU TO GET TO THIS STAGE -- TOO BAD THAT HAVING DIED,\" died as an ego, \"YOU ARE UNABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE. WITHOUT A DOUBT, WORDS AND PHRASES ARE A GREAT DISEASE, BUT HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE SAYING\"\n-- and it is a beautiful statement from the master:\nHANGING FROM A CLIFF, LET GO --\nAND AGREE TO ACCEPT THE EXPERIENCE.\nThat is the most important part in it: hanging from a cliff, let go.\nThat is accepting death of the ego. But don't do it with effort, with tension. Don't do it to achieve anything based on greed or ambition; just do it simply to discover your real self. The right way of doing is ... agree to accept the experience.\nYuan Wu tells Ta Hui: You have not agreed to accept the experience, so only the first half is complete. The ego has died and has left you in a limbo, because you have not been absolutely total in your let-go. Let-go you managed -- but it was a managed let-go, it was not a spontaneous acceptance. You have not enjoyed the let-go. If you had enjoyed, then:\nAFTER ANNIHILATION, COME BACK TO LIFE -- I COULD NOT DECEIVE YOU.\nHe was a man of few words. It is unfortunate ... very rarely a few people become enlightened, but out of those few the major part never say anything. The few who say anything say only fragments, and in a language ... unless you are enlightened it will not be possible to comprehend their meaning. And a few never say a single word. They don't leave any trace on the sands of this bank, of this shore; they simply disappear into the other shore.\nTa Hui, hearing this saying from the master Yuan Wu, hanging from a cliff, let-go -- and agree to accept the experience ... If you can manage this falling into the abyss as a celebration, with a joyful heart, then after annihilation, come back to life -- then there is no problem: you will come back to life. In fact, what you used to think of as life was not life; now you will come to the eternal life. But the bridge between the two is total acceptance.\nYuan Wu must have seen in the eyes of Ta Hui some doubt, some question mark. That's why he adds, \"I could not deceive you.\"\nTa Hui remained with Master Yuan Wu; he fell in love with the master. When the master could even see in his mind just a little doubt, and had to say, \"I could not deceive you,\" it was clear that he had come to the right man, who could look into his very being and could say in exact words what had happened to him. Half of his journey was over, but because he had not been in a total accepting mood, the half had been incomplete ...\"Now accept totally, and resurrection will happen on its own.\"\nNaturally Ta Hui would have doubted; that is the nature of intellect, to doubt, and he was a very intelligent man, young, fresh, and belonging to the genius category. He must have realized that the master had even seen the unexpressed doubt in his mind, and that is why he is saying, \"I could not deceive you.\"\nHe remained with the master. Listening to the master, imbibing his spirit, his presence, slowly, slowly he became very articulate, although enlightenment perhaps was still far away ... And it became even farther away, because he started receiving honors from the people -- even from the emperor, from the government -- as a realized man. These are very dangerous things. When you are not realized and the government recognizes you, and great honors are conferred on you, you can get into a deluded state about yourself. You can start thinking, \"Perhaps I am enlightened.\"\nTwo things can do this. One: he has learned in moving from master to master everything that Zen teaching is. So if you listen only to his words, it is very difficult for you to find that\nhe is not enlightened. Unless you are enlightened, you will not be able to see the flaws, the small gaps, which are bound to be there because it is not his own experience; it is simply clippings from other masters that he has collected -- collected with tremendous intelligence. He almost deceived the Imperial Power. They honored him as the \"Buddha Sun,\" as the \"Sun of Enlightenment.\"\nEMPEROR HSIAO TSUNG BESTOWED THE TITLE \"CH'AN MASTER OF GREAT WISDOM\" FROM WHICH THE NAME TA HUI COMES.\nTa Hui means the \"Great Master of Wisdom.\"\nOnly at the last moment it seems he attained enlightenment, just before he died, but then he did not say anything except a small verse. So I have called him \"The Great Teacher\" -- and he was certainly a great teacher. He influenced millions of people; he was a great leader in the sense that anybody who came in contact with him was immediately intellectually convinced. But he had no presence, and he had no inner silence. It seems that only at the last moment he attained the goal, he completed the journey.\nIT WAS ELEVEN SIXTY-THREE, ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE EIGHTH MONTH, AFTER SHOWING SIGNS OF ILLNESS, WHEN TA HUI TOLD THE CONGREGATION OF MONKS, NUNS, AND LAY PEOPLE, \"TOMORROW I AM GOING.\"\nThat is the first indication that he knows when he is going to die. The second ... towards the pre-dawn hours, his attendant asked Ta Hui for a verse. That is an old tradition in China: when a great master dies, as his last statement, his last gift to the world, people ask him to write a verse.\nIN A SERIOUS VOICE TA HUI SAID, \"WITHOUT A VERSE, I COULD NOT DIE.\" HE TOOK UP THE BRUSH, AND WROTE:\nBIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE WHAT'S THE FUSS?\nThis is the whole idea of Gautam Buddha's philosophy of suchness condensed. Birth is thus ... thusness or suchness mean exactly the same. There is no reason to think why it is: it is there.\nBIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS ...\nThere is no reason why you are dying. A tremendous acceptability is part of the philosophy of thusness, or suchness. Everything that happens, the man of understanding simply accepts it\n-- this is how things are, this is how nature functions. There is no complaint, there is no grudge.\nBIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE WHAT'S THE FUSS?\nTHEN HE LET GO OF THE WRITING BRUSH AND PASSED ON.\nPerhaps in this moment, when he was writing this verse, he completed his journey.\nThe discourses that are going to follow were given when he was not enlightened, but he was very clear in explaining everything to the ordinary people. He moved amongst laymen, he talked to the ordinary people, and he talked in a way that they could understand. His whole approach was that the great masters are not available to the people; they are available only to very intimate disciples, or perhaps only to the devotees -- who will take care of the millions? So he started moving amongst the people, and the people were rejoicing; that's why the emperor honored him as a great master, as a sun of awareness.\nMasters don't move, they don't go to the people; they know the gap between them and the ordinary people is too big, almost unbridgeable. Unless somebody comes close to the master on his own accord, there is no way for the master to penetrate his being.\nBut Ta Hui was not a master, he was a very articulate teacher. He was not talking Zen; he was talking about Zen. All that he had gathered ... and he had gathered really very consistently, very logically. Only once in a while will I tell you that he has committed a mistake -- which is natural, because he has nothing inside himself to compare it with. He has no criterion except his intelligence, his logic, his reason. But enlightenment is beyond your mind, beyond your rationality, beyond your intellect. That ultimate criterion is not within him. But he is certainly of immense cleverness, although blind; he has not seen the light. He describes the light as if he is a man who has eyes. He has only heard people who have eyes. But he has collected every piece of information in a very systematic way. So remember this: he is a teacher, not a master. And I make an absolute distinction.\nA teacher is one who transfers knowledge which he has collected, borrowed from others. He can be very articulate. If you face a master and a teacher perhaps you may choose the teacher, because he will be more appealing to your intellect and mind.\nThe master will look a little crazy. He will be jumping from one point to another point without creating a systematic philosophy. But the master has the real treasure, the teacher has only heard about it. The teacher is poor, howsoever clever.\nThe sutras:\nBUDDHA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD, the\nworld of ultimate awareness, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR MIND AS CLEAR AS EMPTY SPACE.\nIt is another way of saying that you should move beyond mind into a state of no-mind, because there is no such thing as empty mind. That's why I say such flaws will be there. Empty mind? Empty space? A man of enlightenment would have simply said, \"You should move beyond mind to no-mind.\"\nThere is a very famous book by a rabbi, Joshua Liebman. It has sold millions of copies in many languages. It is a beautiful piece of work; the name of the book is PEACE OF MIND. Naturally, everybody wants peace of mind.\nI wrote a letter in 1950 to him, saying \"Your very title shows that you don't know anything about meditation. Peace of mind is a contradiction in terms: when mind is there, peace cannot be; and if peace is there, then mind cannot be. They cannot both be there together.\" In fact, mind is your anxiety, your anguish, your tensions, your thoughts, your emotions, sentiments, moods, ups and downs -- everything is mind. Peace is possible only if you go beyond mind.\nSo I told him, \"If you are really sincere, in the next edition you should change the title. Peace is equal to no-mind.\" I had made it so clear in many ways to him. But this is the situation of our intellectuals -- he never replied, because there was nothing to reply. He must have seen that what I am saying is a fact.\nBut I can forgive Joshua Liebman because he knows nothing of Eastern meditation. He is an American Jew, and meditation is simply a strange phenomenon to them. Peace of mind? ... Perhaps my letter was the only one that had objected to the title. I said, \"When the title is wrong I cannot read the book, because I know perfectly well that when a man writes a book and even the title is wrong, his book is worthless. If you ever change the title ... but just the change of title won't do -- you will have to change the whole book according to the title.\"\nAND LEAVE FALSE THINKING AND ALL GRASPING FAR BEHIND ...\nNow he is saying exactly what I mean by no-mind, but no-mind would not have been conceivable for him. He is a mind, and everything that he has understood is through mind. And the people who are listening to him are able to make a bridge between his understanding and their understanding because all are minds. A mind can talk to another mind very easily.\nSo he has collected these words, empty space, and Leave false thinking and all grasping far behind. But I would like to make you aware how even the most intelligent people can fall into traps. He is saying, leave false thinking -- what about right thinking? A man of enlightenment will simply say, \"leave all thinking.\" Thinking as such is a problem -- either false or not. Mind can conceive that that which is wrong can be left, and that which is good can be kept. But you cannot divide the wrong from the right. They are two sides of the same coin, and you cannot have a coin with only one side; the other side will be there.\nIf you protect right thinking -- whatever you think is right -- underneath will remain wrong thinking. If you try \"love\" ... of course love is not wrong thinking; it is one of the most beautiful emotions, and the thought of love is one of the great thoughts. But just behind love there will be hate hiding, and love can change into hate anytime. Right thinking can become wrong thinking anytime.\nIf it had been his own experience, he would not have said, leave false thinking and all grasping far behind; he would have said, leave all thinking and all grasping far behind, causing your mind to be unobstructed wherever it may turn.\nBut these are the qualities of no-mind.\nTHE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD IS NOT SOME EXTERNAL WORLD WHERE THERE IS A FORMAL \"BUDDHA\": IT IS THE REALM OF THE WISDOM OF A SELF-AWAKENED SAGE.\nHe has collected the right words.\nOnce you are determined ... In Sanskrit and in Hindustani, the word which has been translated as \"determined\" is far deeper and more significant. The word is nishchaya. 'Determined' has a quality of stubbornness, adamantness. It has a quality of something that belongs to the ego, such as, \"I am determined to do it.\" The word nishchaya does not have all these connotations.\nNishchaya is a very beautiful word. It means when you come to the master, just his presence, his fragrance, his eyes, his gestures, his words, his silence give you a tremendous trust within. It is not your determination; it is the deep impact of the enlightened man in your heart.\nInstead of saying 'determined,' I would like to say that once you are in trust, in nishchaya, no doubt arises. All doubts have disappeared; you feel completely at ease.\nThis nishchaya -- that you want to know this realm -- is bound to create in you a longing, not a desire. These words may mean the same in the dictionaries, but in actual existence they are so far apart. When you have attained to nishchaya -- \"This is the man to whom I belong, this is the man whom I have been searching for lives. These are the eyes I have seen in the silences of my heart, this is the face I have been looking for in so many, many ways in so many lives\" ... suddenly a nishchaya, a trust which knows no doubt. It is not a belief; belief is always about doctrines. Trust is always about persons.\nIt is not what the master is saying that you believe; it is what the master is that creates a nishchaya, a trust in you. And that trust will start growing into a deep longing -- you would also like to enter into the same world of awareness, into the same world of blissfulness, into the same paradise where your master is.\nYOU DO NOT NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN IT\n... your longing will just go on becoming deeper and deeper and deeper. You will be waiting with tremendous love. You will not demand of existence, \"Give me this state,\" because any demand on existence is ugly. You will simply wait; you will not even pray. You will simply feel thirsty, and existence is compassionate enough. You cannot dominate it, but if you are simply thirsty, you will find existence fulfills your longing.\nHe has at least heard well!\nYOU DO NOT NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN IT. YOU MUST CLEAR AWAY THE STAINS OF AFFLICTIONS FROM ALIEN SENSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON YOUR MIND SINCE BEGINNINGLESS TIME, SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS BROAD AND OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE ...\nYou can see the discrepancy! If you say that your mind is as open as empty space, it is no longer mind. It is as if you are saying, \"When your fire is as cold as ice\" -- then why call it fire? Just calling it ice will be the right thing! But for an intellectual it is difficult; he is simply collecting opinions. And nobody is going to raise a question, because they don't know that he is committing a mistake either.\n... SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS BROAD AND OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE ...\nHow much space is there? Do you know? The whole universe is empty space. The mind does not have the capacity to be so broad.\n... DETACHED FROM ALL THE CLINGING OF THE DISCRIMINATING INTELLECT, AND YOUR FALSE, UNREAL, VAIN THOUGHTS TOO ARE LIKE EMPTY SPACE.\nBut he goes on making the distinction that you should keep your good thoughts.\nIn a state of absolute silence and peace there are no good thoughts, no bad thoughts. Thoughts as such are a disturbance, whether they are good or bad. The sinner may be having bad thoughts in his mind, and the saint may be having good thoughts in his mind, but both are in the mind. There is no qualitative difference between them.\nThe true sage, the buddha, has no mind at all. He lives without mind, he acts without mind.\nIt comes from his very innermost being; hence, it has a quality, a freshness, a great splendor. Thoughts are always dusty and old. The sage always acts afresh, not out of any old thoughts; he responds to the situation moment to moment. There is no need for him to think. It is almost like a blind man: if he wants to go out of this auditorium, he will have to ask, \"Where is the way?\" And then, with his walking stick, he will find the way and go out. But you never even think about it when you want to go out; you simply see the way out and you go. There is no thinking involved in it, and certainly no walking stick.\nI have heard about a blind man whose eyes were operated upon. He had come with his walking stick, and after a few days the doctor opened the bandage on his eyes and told him, \"Now, slowly, slowly open your eyes. Your eyes are perfectly good; now you can see.\"\nHe was amazed at what he had been missing, all the colors, the sun, the moon, the stars, people's faces -- everything he had been missing. He thanked the doctor, but out of old habit he took his walking stick. The doctor said, \"What are you taking that walking stick for? Leave it.\"\nBut he said, \"Without it how am I going to find my way?\"\nThe doctor said, \"You are an idiot. Now you have eyes, there is no need to find the way; the way will be clear to you. Just put that walking stick on that pile.\"\nThere were many walking sticks. All the people he had cured had come with their walking sticks, and he had been collecting them as souvenirs, showing how many people he had cured. And he said, \"It is not only you! Every blind man, when I cure his eyes, immediately picks up his walking stick to start going out.\"\nUnconscious habit ... too long he has had the walking stick; he cannot believe that life is possible without it.\nThe same is the situation of all who have lived with the mind for millions of lives. That has been their guide, whatever they wanted to do. It is inconceivable for the mind that you can live even for a single moment without it. But it is just a walking stick for a blind man.\nThere is far more consciousness beyond the mind -- so broad, so spacious, so silent that you need not think. It simply goes on responding. In the mind you have to think what to do and what not to do. It is always a question of either/or.\nThe moment you are beyond mind there is no question of either/or. You simply know what has to be done and you do it, and there is no repentance, ever. You never look back, you never feel that you have done something wrong -- you cannot do wrong.\nThese are the reasons why I have not called Ta Hui the great Master. I am simply calling him a great teacher; perhaps at the last moment he became enlightened -- but at the last moment. These teachings were given before it.\nTHEN THIS WONDROUS EFFORTLESS MIND WILL BE UNIMPEDED WHEREVER IT GOES.\nHe goes on using the word \"mind\" for \"no-mind.\" Because he has been collecting, and he has no inner criterion, you will come across many contradictions. In the second sutra, which is called mindlessness ... now what has happened to the mind that he was talking about in the first sutra?\nAN ANCIENT WORTHY HAD A SAYING: \"TO LOOK FOR THE OX, ONE MUST SEEK OUT ITS TRACKS. TO STUDY THE PATH, SEEK OUT MINDLESSNESS. WHERE THE TRACKS ARE, SO MUST THE OX BE.\"\nThe ox is an old symbol in Zen tradition for the lost soul, the lost self that you have forgotten all about. Mindlessness will show you the path, will indicate to you the soul; it will become an arrow, and you have simply to follow without any tension, without any effort.\nTHE PATH OF MINDLESSNESS IS EASY TO SEEK OUT. SO-CALLED MINDLESSNESS IS NOT BEING INERT AND UNKNOWING LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE; IT MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED\n... Again he starts using the word \"mind.\" This is the trouble with a teacher.\nIT MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED AND IMPERTURBABLE WHEN IN CONTACT WITH SITUATIONS AND MEETING CIRCUMSTANCES; THAT IT DOES NOT CLING TO ANYTHING, BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES, WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION; WITHOUT BEING STAINED\n... but it is still there. Then why did he start calling the sutra mindlessness? The mind again comes in. It is settled, but that which is settled can be unsettled any moment. It is imperturbable, but that which is imperturbable can be perturbed.\nThat it does not cling to anything ... but it is there. And clinging is an old habit; it can start clinging tomorrow, if not today. It can fall back.\n... BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION; WITHOUT BEING STAINED.\nIf it is there, there is every possibility of its being stained. Mindlessness is the right word to explain pure space, without any possibility of falling back.\n... YET WITHOUT DWELLING IN THE STAINLESSNESS; VIEWING BODY AND MIND LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS ...\nYou can see his mind continuously wavering, because all these statements he must have collected from different people. Some may have been enlightened, some may have been just teachers, some may have been just learned people. He has made a good collection -- but I can see that there are inconsistencies in it, because I have a criterion within me.\nVIEWING BODY AND MIND LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS ...\nIf mind and body are illusions, then what is the need of making them broad, making them spacious, making them non-clinging? If they are like dreams or illusions, just wake up and they are finished. That wakefulness is mindlessness.\n... YET WITHOUT REMAINING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF DREAMS' AND ILLUSIONS' EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. ONLY WHEN ONE ARRIVES AT A REALM LIKE THIS CAN IT BE CALLED TRUE MINDLESSNESS.\nHe is utterly messed up! He may have been helpful in bringing people to the masters, but he himself is not yet clear on what he is saying.\nNO, IT IS NOT LIP-SERVICE MINDLESSNESS: IF YOU HAVE NOT ATTAINED TRUE MINDLESSNESS AND JUST GO BY THE VERBAL KIND -- and that's what he is doing -- HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE PERVERTED CH'AN OF \"SILENT ILLUMINATION\"?\nThese people commit many mistakes because of their attachment to a certain school. Now, he is attached to a certain school -- Mahayana also has different sects. First Buddhism was divided into two sects, Mahayana and Hinayana; then they started dividing into different sects. In all, there are now thirty-six sects. A man of unenlightenment is continuously trying to defend, to criticize, the other sects.\nIn China there has been a sect called \"The Sect of Silent Illumination.\" I don't see that there is any problem -- all illumination happens in silence. Silence is the illumination. But people fight over words: because they don't call it enlightenment, they call it illumination, that has created a rift. But you can understand very easily that both words mean the same. 'Illumination' or 'enlightenment' -- both are simply declaring that darkness has disappeared. What you choose to call it is immaterial.\n\"Just get to the root, don't worry about the branches\" -- he must have got this from an enlightened master. \"Just get to the root, don't worry about the branches,\" because once you have cut the root, the whole tree will wither away. But just cutting the branches is not going to help; the foliage may become, on the contrary, thicker.\nEMPTYING THIS MIND IS THE ROOT.\nNot just emptying ... in the first place, there is no way to empty the mind. You don't have any control over your mind. It goes on in its own way, filled with dreams and thoughts and emotions and feelings and reactions, sadnesses, happinesses -- there is no way to empty it. How are you going to empty it? From one side you will be emptying it, and from the other side a great flow will go on coming in. The only way to empty it is to go beyond it -- to become awareness.\nWatch the mind, and the mind disappears.\nONCE YOU GET THE ROOT, THE FUNDAMENTAL, THEN ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE AND ALL YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AS YOU RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES, THROUGH SO MANY UPSETS AND DOWNFALLS, WHETHER JOYOUS OR ANGRY, GOOD OR BAD, FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE -- THESE ARE ALL TRIVIAL MATTERS, THE BRANCHES. IF YOU CAN BE SPONTANEOUSLY AWARE AND KNOWING AS YOU ARE GOING ALONG WITH CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN THERE IS NEITHER LACK NOR EXCESS.\nThat is one of the most important experiences of Gautam Buddha. He says that if you are just in the middle of any two polar opposites -- find exactly the middle, neither lack nor excess\n-- if you are exactly in the middle, you will go beyond.\nThe middle is the beyond.\nIf you go to the extreme, then you will start clinging to it; from the extreme you cannot go beyond.\nThat was a great contribution to spiritual science and to humanity, that the middle is the beyond. Just keep yourself balanced in the middle, and suddenly you will see you have gone above both the extremes -- neither good nor bad, neither ordinary nor extraordinary, neither knowledgeable nor ignorant.\nThis beyondness is his nirvana. Just to think about it you will feel an immense peace. Just visualize it and you will feel a great silence descending on you. And this is only visualization\n-- what will happen in actuality if you come to the middle? You cannot conceive the ecstasy of it, the blissfulness of it, the benediction of it.\nI have chosen Ta Hui to help you understand the difference between the teacher and the master, because many religions have lost their masters. For example, Jainism in India has had no masters, no enlightened persons at all, for centuries -- only teachers.\nWithout an enlightened being, the religion loses its soul. It is only the small stream of enlightened people that keeps the religion breathing and its heart beating, that keeps it alive, flowering.\nAnd one enlightened person is not just a singular phenomenon; he spreads his illumination all around. Wherever he is, he carries a certain energy field, and whoever is receptive will be pulled into the energy field. The teacher has no energy field. He is just repeating mechanically like a parrot.\nBut Ta Hui was certainly a great teacher, because he collected ... he went to dozens of enlightened masters. He was so young when he was initiated into monkhood, and he gathered like a bee gathers honey from thousands of flowers. So on the one hand he is very rich; he has brought so much honey from different flowers. But on the other hand he is very poor; he has not contributed anything from his own being. But I am happy that at least in the end, at the very end of his life, he became enlightened. His small verse is certainly of great beauty:\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6495","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 Clear the mind</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6495 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

express his own view. In every case Ta Hui completely comprehended the
subtle meaning. The older master exclaimed, "You must be someone who's
come again!"</p><p>Yuan Wu told Ta Hhui, "It wasn't easy for you to get to this stage --
too bad that having died, you are unable to come back to life. Without a
doubt, words and phrases are a great disease, but haven't you seen the
saying</p><p><br></p><p>HANGING FROM A CLIFF, LET GO --</p><p>AND AGREE TO ACCEPT THE EXPERIENCE. AFTER ANNIHILATION, COME BACK TO
LIFE -- I COULDN'T DECEIVE YOU."</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui was given a purple robe and the name "Buddha Sun" as a sign of
imperial honor. Emperor Hsiao Tsung bestowed the title "Ch'an master of
great wisdom" from which the name of Ta Hui comes.</p><p>It was eleven sixty-three, on the ninth day of the eighth month,
after showing signs of illness, when Ta Hui told the congregation of
monks, nuns, and lay-people, "Tomorrow I'm going." Towards the pre-dawn
hours, his attendant asked Ta Hui for a verse. In a serious voice Ta Hui
said, "Without a verse, I couldn't die." He took up the brush and
wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>BIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE THAT'S THE FUSS?</p><p>then he let go of the writing brush and passed on.</p><p>1</p><p>Clear the mind</p><p>15 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CLEAR THE MIND (TO LI HSIEN-CH'EN)</p><p>BUDDHA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD, YOU MUST
MAKE YOUR MIND AS CLEAR AS EMPTY SPACE, AND LEAVE FALSE THINKING AND ALL
GRASPING FAR BEHIND, CAUSING YOUR MIND TO BE UNOBSTRUCTED WHEREVER IT
MAY TURN. THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD IS NOT SOME EXTERNAL WORLD, WHERE
THERE IS A FORMAL "BUDDHA": IT'S THE REALM OF THE WISDOM OF A
SELF-AWAKENED SAGE.</p><p>ONCE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW THIS REALM, YOU DO NOT
NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN IT. YOU MUST CLEAR
AWAY THE STAINS OF AFFLICTIONS FROM ALIEN SENSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON
YOUR MIND SINCE BEGINNINGLESS TIME, SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS BROAD AND
OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE, DETACHED FROM ALL THE CLINGING OF THE
DISCRIMINATING INTELLECT, AND YOUR FALSE, UNREAL, VAIN THOUGHTS TOO ARE
LIKE EMPTY SPACE. THEN THIS WONDROUS, EFFORTLESS MIND WILL BE UNIMPEDED
WHEREVER IT GOES.</p><p>MINDLESSNESS (TO HUNG PO-CH'ONG)</p><p>AN ANCIENT WORTHY HAD A SAYING: "TO LOOK FOR THE OX, ONE MUST SEEK
OUT ITS TRACKS. TO STUDY THE PATH, SEEK OUT MINDLESSNESS. WHERE THE
TRACKS ARE, SO MUST THE OX BE." THE PATH OF MINDLESSNESS IS EASY TO SEEK
OUT. SO-CALLED MINDLESSNESS IS NOT BEING INERT AND UNKNOWING LIKE EARTH,
WOOD, TILE, OR STONE; IT MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED AND
IMPERTURBABLE WHEN IN CONTACT WITH SITUATIONS AND MEETING CIRCUMSTANCES;
THAT IT DOES NOT CLING TO ANYTHING, BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES, WITHOUT
HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION; WITHOUT BEING STAINED, YET WITHOUT DWELLING IN
THE STAINLESSNESS; VIEWING BODY AND MIND LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS, YET
WITHOUT REMAINING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF DREAMS' AND ILLUSIONS' EMPTY
NOTHINGNESS.</p><p>ONLY WHEN ONE ARRIVES AT A REALM LIKE THIS, CAN IT BE CALLED TRUE
MINDLESSNESS. NO, IT'S NOT LIP-SERVICE MINDLESSNESS: IF YOU HAVEN'T
ATTAINED TRUE MINDLESSNESS AND JUST GO BY THE VERBAL KIND, HOW IS THIS
DIFFERENT FROM THE PERVERTED CH'AN OF "SILENT ILLUMINATION"?</p><p>"JUST GET TO THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES." EMPTYING THIS
MIND IS THE ROOT. ONCE YOU GET THE ROOT, THE</p><p>FUNDAMENTAL, THEN ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE AND ALL</p><p>YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AS YOU RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND ADAPT TO
CIRCUMSTANCES, THROUGH SO MANY UPSETS AND DOWNFALLS, WHETHER</p><p>JOYOUS OR ANGRY, GOOD OR BAD, FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE -- THESE ARE ALL
TRIVIAL MATTERS, THE BRANCHES. IF YOU CAN BE SPONTANEOUSLY AWARE AND
KNOWING AS YOU ARE GOING ALONG WITH CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN THERE IS NEITHER
LACK NOR EXCESS.</p><p><br></p><p>The great Zen teacher Ta Hui comes from the same lineage as
Bodhidharma. He was born four hundred years after Bodhidharma had left
for the Himalayas, to disappear into the eternal ice, the eternal
silence there.</p><p>I have called Ta Hui the great Zen teacher -- not a master ... it has
to be explained to you clearly. The master is one who is enlightened.
but sometimes it happens that the master may be enlightened, but is not
articulate enough to give expression to what he has known. That is a
totally different art.</p><p>The teacher is not enlightened, but he is very articulate. He can say
things which the master, although he knows, cannot bring to words. The
teacher can say them, although he does not know.</p><p>The teacher he has heard ... he has lived with enlightened people, he
has imbibed their energy, he has been showered by their flowers. He has
tasted something transpiring from the enlightened ones, so he has a
certainty that something like enlightenment happens, but he has no
authority of his own; his authority is borrowed. And if the teacher is a
genius, he can almost manage to express things over which masters have
faltered, or they have remained silent.</p><p>The teacher has his own utility. He is more available to the people
-- he belongs to the people. The master is on a high sunlit peak. Even
if he shouts from there, only echoes reach to the people's ears. But the
teacher lives amongst the people, knows their life, knows their
language, knows how things should be expressed so they can understand.
The master remains committed to his experience, while the teacher is
more committed to the people, to spread the message.</p><p>Once in a while it happens that the master cannot express at all. For
example, Ramakrishna was an enlightened man, but utterly uneducated,
uncultured, knowing nothing of great literature, knowing nothing of what
other enlightened people have said. He experienced the beauty of his
inner being, but he was absolutely handicapped as far as conveying it to
others. He had to take the support of a man, Vivekananda, who was not
enlightened but was a great genius -- very intelligent, rational,
logical, intellectual, well-versed, well-educated. He became the
mouthpiece of Ramakrishna. He went around the world spreading his
message.</p><p>Whatever exists today as Ramakrishna Mission, is completely the work
of Vivekananda, but he himself died in utter agony. The agony was more
intense because he had been spreading the good news of ecstasy, but
inside he was empty. His whole message was only verbal, but he managed
it so cleverly that many started thinking of him as enlightened.</p><p>The same thing happened with Ta Hui. When he was just sixteen years
old he was so intelligent ... he left the world, and after one year of
preparation he was initiated as a monk, when he was just seventeen. Then
he went from master to master, seeking the right enlightened man who
could show him the way.</p><p>He found his master in Yuan Wu. It seems almost the same situation:
Yuan Wu knows, but cannot say it. Ta Hui does not know, but can say it.
Just living with the master, imbibing</p><p>his energy, watching his grace -- the way he walks, the way he sits,
the way he remains silent ...</p><p>Rarely, once in a while, Yuan Wu speaks a word or sentence. His
statements are collected in a small book, BLUE CLIFF RECORD, but they
are almost impossible to understand. They don't seem to be related to
each other, relevant to each other; they look fragmentary. They don't
create a system.</p><p>Even though his words were recorded in BLUE CLIFF RECORD, Yuan Wu
never addressed the people. On the contrary, he simply asked Ta Hui just
to look into the BLUE CLIFF RECORD and express his opinion, say what he
thinks of them. He was not certain that he had been able to say what he
wanted to say, and whether what he had said conveyed anything or was
just a futile exercise. In every case Ta Hui completely comprehended the
subtle meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OLDER MASTER EXCLAIMED, "YOU MUST BE SOMEONE WHO HAS COME
AGAIN!"</p><p><br></p><p>By saying this he is saying, "You must have been born almost
enlightened, just a little bit is missing; perhaps you may be able to
manage it in this life. But you have understood my expressions perfectly
well." This was his seal, when he said "You must be someone who has come
again!" -- you cannot be new. You have been on the path for a long, long
time; although you have not achieved the ultimate end, you are very
close.</p><p>But the master could not be deceived just by Ta Hui's understanding
of the words, which any intelligent man of great talent like Ta Hui
could have done. Yuan Wu again said to Ta Hui, "It was not easy for you
to get to this stage" -- you have struggled hard -- "Too bad that having
died, you are unable to come back to life." This will be clear to you if
I refer to Jesus who says, "Unless you are born again, you will not
understand the truth."</p><p>There are two parts of the path. The first part is to let your ego
die. It is strenuous, arduous, difficult, because you know only your
ego, you don't know your authentic self. You are jumping into an abyss,
not knowing whether you will survive or not; THAT Ta Hui has done. But
the second part -- of resurrection, of giving birth to your new
individuality, or your authentic being -- has not happened.</p><p><br></p><p>"IT WAS NOT EASY FOR YOU TO GET TO THIS STAGE -- TOO BAD THAT HAVING
DIED," died as an ego, "YOU ARE UNABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE. WITHOUT A
DOUBT, WORDS AND PHRASES ARE A GREAT DISEASE, BUT HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE
SAYING"</p><p>-- and it is a beautiful statement from the master:</p><p><br></p><p>HANGING FROM A CLIFF, LET GO --</p><p>AND AGREE TO ACCEPT THE EXPERIENCE.</p><p>That is the most important part in it: hanging from a cliff, let
go.</p><p>That is accepting death of the ego. But don't do it with effort, with
tension. Don't do it to achieve anything based on greed or ambition;
just do it simply to discover your real self. The right way of doing is
... agree to accept the experience.</p><p>Yuan Wu tells Ta Hui: You have not agreed to accept the experience,
so only the first half is complete. The ego has died and has left you in
a limbo, because you have not been absolutely total in your let-go.
Let-go you managed -- but it was a managed let-go, it was not a
spontaneous acceptance. You have not enjoyed the let-go. If you had
enjoyed, then:</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER ANNIHILATION, COME BACK TO LIFE -- I COULD NOT DECEIVE YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a man of few words. It is unfortunate ... very rarely a few
people become enlightened, but out of those few the major part never say
anything. The few who say anything say only fragments, and in a language
... unless you are enlightened it will not be possible to comprehend
their meaning. And a few never say a single word. They don't leave any
trace on the sands of this bank, of this shore; they simply disappear
into the other shore.</p><p>Ta Hui, hearing this saying from the master Yuan Wu, hanging from a
cliff, let-go -- and agree to accept the experience ... If you can
manage this falling into the abyss as a celebration, with a joyful
heart, then after annihilation, come back to life -- then there is no
problem: you will come back to life. In fact, what you used to think of
as life was not life; now you will come to the eternal life. But the
bridge between the two is total acceptance.</p><p>Yuan Wu must have seen in the eyes of Ta Hui some doubt, some
question mark. That's why he adds, "I could not deceive you."</p><p>Ta Hui remained with Master Yuan Wu; he fell in love with the master.
When the master could even see in his mind just a little doubt, and had
to say, "I could not deceive you," it was clear that he had come to the
right man, who could look into his very being and could say in exact
words what had happened to him. Half of his journey was over, but
because he had not been in a total accepting mood, the half had been
incomplete ..."Now accept totally, and resurrection will happen on its
own."</p><p>Naturally Ta Hui would have doubted; that is the nature of intellect,
to doubt, and he was a very intelligent man, young, fresh, and belonging
to the genius category. He must have realized that the master had even
seen the unexpressed doubt in his mind, and that is why he is saying, "I
could not deceive you."</p><p>He remained with the master. Listening to the master, imbibing his
spirit, his presence, slowly, slowly he became very articulate, although
enlightenment perhaps was still far away ... And it became even farther
away, because he started receiving honors from the people -- even from
the emperor, from the government -- as a realized man. These are very
dangerous things. When you are not realized and the government
recognizes you, and great honors are conferred on you, you can get into
a deluded state about yourself. You can start thinking, "Perhaps I am
enlightened."</p><p>Two things can do this. One: he has learned in moving from master to
master everything that Zen teaching is. So if you listen only to his
words, it is very difficult for you to find that</p><p>he is not enlightened. Unless you are enlightened, you will not be
able to see the flaws, the small gaps, which are bound to be there
because it is not his own experience; it is simply clippings from other
masters that he has collected -- collected with tremendous intelligence.
He almost deceived the Imperial Power. They honored him as the "Buddha
Sun," as the "Sun of Enlightenment."</p><p><br></p><p>EMPEROR HSIAO TSUNG BESTOWED THE TITLE "CH'AN MASTER OF GREAT WISDOM"
FROM WHICH THE NAME TA HUI COMES.</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui means the "Great Master of Wisdom."</p><p>Only at the last moment it seems he attained enlightenment, just
before he died, but then he did not say anything except a small verse.
So I have called him "The Great Teacher" -- and he was certainly a great
teacher. He influenced millions of people; he was a great leader in the
sense that anybody who came in contact with him was immediately
intellectually convinced. But he had no presence, and he had no inner
silence. It seems that only at the last moment he attained the goal, he
completed the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>IT WAS ELEVEN SIXTY-THREE, ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE EIGHTH MONTH,
AFTER SHOWING SIGNS OF ILLNESS, WHEN TA HUI TOLD THE CONGREGATION OF
MONKS, NUNS, AND LAY PEOPLE, "TOMORROW I AM GOING."</p><p><br></p><p>That is the first indication that he knows when he is going to die.
The second ... towards the pre-dawn hours, his attendant asked Ta Hui
for a verse. That is an old tradition in China: when a great master
dies, as his last statement, his last gift to the world, people ask him
to write a verse.</p><p><br></p><p>IN A SERIOUS VOICE TA HUI SAID, "WITHOUT A VERSE, I COULD NOT DIE."
HE TOOK UP THE BRUSH, AND WROTE:</p><p>BIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE WHAT'S THE FUSS?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole idea of Gautam Buddha's philosophy of suchness
condensed. Birth is thus ... thusness or suchness mean exactly the same.
There is no reason to think why it is: it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>BIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS ...</p><p><br></p><p>There is no reason why you are dying. A tremendous acceptability is
part of the philosophy of thusness, or suchness. Everything that
happens, the man of understanding simply accepts it</p><p>-- this is how things are, this is how nature functions. There is no
complaint, there is no grudge.</p><p><br></p><p>BIRTH IS THUS DEATH IS THUS VERSE OR NO VERSE WHAT'S THE FUSS?</p><p>THEN HE LET GO OF THE WRITING BRUSH AND PASSED ON.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps in this moment, when he was writing this verse, he completed
his journey.</p><p>The discourses that are going to follow were given when he was not
enlightened, but he was very clear in explaining everything to the
ordinary people. He moved amongst laymen, he talked to the ordinary
people, and he talked in a way that they could understand. His whole
approach was that the great masters are not available to the people;
they are available only to very intimate disciples, or perhaps only to
the devotees -- who will take care of the millions? So he started moving
amongst the people, and the people were rejoicing; that's why the
emperor honored him as a great master, as a sun of awareness.</p><p>Masters don't move, they don't go to the people; they know the gap
between them and the ordinary people is too big, almost unbridgeable.
Unless somebody comes close to the master on his own accord, there is no
way for the master to penetrate his being.</p><p>But Ta Hui was not a master, he was a very articulate teacher. He was
not talking Zen; he was talking about Zen. All that he had gathered ...
and he had gathered really very consistently, very logically. Only once
in a while will I tell you that he has committed a mistake -- which is
natural, because he has nothing inside himself to compare it with. He
has no criterion except his intelligence, his logic, his reason. But
enlightenment is beyond your mind, beyond your rationality, beyond your
intellect. That ultimate criterion is not within him. But he is
certainly of immense cleverness, although blind; he has not seen the
light. He describes the light as if he is a man who has eyes. He has
only heard people who have eyes. But he has collected every piece of
information in a very systematic way. So remember this: he is a teacher,
not a master. And I make an absolute distinction.</p><p>A teacher is one who transfers knowledge which he has collected,
borrowed from others. He can be very articulate. If you face a master
and a teacher perhaps you may choose the teacher, because he will be
more appealing to your intellect and mind.</p><p>The master will look a little crazy. He will be jumping from one
point to another point without creating a systematic philosophy. But the
master has the real treasure, the teacher has only heard about it. The
teacher is poor, howsoever clever.</p><p>The sutras:</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD, the</p><p>world of ultimate awareness, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR MIND AS CLEAR AS
EMPTY SPACE.</p><p><br></p><p>It is another way of saying that you should move beyond mind into a
state of no-mind, because there is no such thing as empty mind. That's
why I say such flaws will be there. Empty mind? Empty space? A man of
enlightenment would have simply said, "You should move beyond mind to
no-mind."</p><p>There is a very famous book by a rabbi, Joshua Liebman. It has sold
millions of copies in many languages. It is a beautiful piece of work;
the name of the book is PEACE OF MIND. Naturally, everybody wants peace
of mind.</p><p>I wrote a letter in 1950 to him, saying "Your very title shows that
you don't know anything about meditation. Peace of mind is a
contradiction in terms: when mind is there, peace cannot be; and if
peace is there, then mind cannot be. They cannot both be there
together." In fact, mind is your anxiety, your anguish, your tensions,
your thoughts, your emotions, sentiments, moods, ups and downs --
everything is mind. Peace is possible only if you go beyond mind.</p><p>So I told him, "If you are really sincere, in the next edition you
should change the title. Peace is equal to no-mind." I had made it so
clear in many ways to him. But this is the situation of our
intellectuals -- he never replied, because there was nothing to reply.
He must have seen that what I am saying is a fact.</p><p>But I can forgive Joshua Liebman because he knows nothing of Eastern
meditation. He is an American Jew, and meditation is simply a strange
phenomenon to them. Peace of mind? ... Perhaps my letter was the only
one that had objected to the title. I said, "When the title is wrong I
cannot read the book, because I know perfectly well that when a man
writes a book and even the title is wrong, his book is worthless. If you
ever change the title ... but just the change of title won't do -- you
will have to change the whole book according to the title."</p><p><br></p><p>AND LEAVE FALSE THINKING AND ALL GRASPING FAR BEHIND ...</p><p><br></p><p>Now he is saying exactly what I mean by no-mind, but no-mind would
not have been conceivable for him. He is a mind, and everything that he
has understood is through mind. And the people who are listening to him
are able to make a bridge between his understanding and their
understanding because all are minds. A mind can talk to another mind
very easily.</p><p>So he has collected these words, empty space, and Leave false
thinking and all grasping far behind. But I would like to make you aware
how even the most intelligent people can fall into traps. He is saying,
leave false thinking -- what about right thinking? A man of
enlightenment will simply say, "leave all thinking." Thinking as such is
a problem -- either false or not. Mind can conceive that that which is
wrong can be left, and that which is good can be kept. But you cannot
divide the wrong from the right. They are two sides of the same coin,
and you cannot have a coin with only one side; the other side will be
there.</p><p>If you protect right thinking -- whatever you think is right --
underneath will remain wrong thinking. If you try "love" ... of course
love is not wrong thinking; it is one of the most beautiful emotions,
and the thought of love is one of the great thoughts. But just behind
love there will be hate hiding, and love can change into hate anytime.
Right thinking can become wrong thinking anytime.</p><p>If it had been his own experience, he would not have said, leave
false thinking and all grasping far behind; he would have said, leave
all thinking and all grasping far behind, causing your mind to be
unobstructed wherever it may turn.</p><p>But these are the qualities of no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>THE REALM OF BUDDHAHOOD IS NOT SOME EXTERNAL WORLD WHERE THERE IS A
FORMAL "BUDDHA": IT IS THE REALM OF THE WISDOM OF A SELF-AWAKENED
SAGE.</p><p><br></p><p>He has collected the right words.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are determined ... In Sanskrit and in Hindustani, the word
which has been translated as "determined" is far deeper and more
significant. The word is nishchaya. 'Determined' has a quality of
stubbornness, adamantness. It has a quality of something that belongs to
the ego, such as, "I am determined to do it." The word nishchaya does
not have all these connotations.</p><p>Nishchaya is a very beautiful word. It means when you come to the
master, just his presence, his fragrance, his eyes, his gestures, his
words, his silence give you a tremendous trust within. It is not your
determination; it is the deep impact of the enlightened man in your
heart.</p><p>Instead of saying 'determined,' I would like to say that once you are
in trust, in nishchaya, no doubt arises. All doubts have disappeared;
you feel completely at ease.</p><p>This nishchaya -- that you want to know this realm -- is bound to
create in you a longing, not a desire. These words may mean the same in
the dictionaries, but in actual existence they are so far apart. When
you have attained to nishchaya -- "This is the man to whom I belong,
this is the man whom I have been searching for lives. These are the eyes
I have seen in the silences of my heart, this is the face I have been
looking for in so many, many ways in so many lives" ... suddenly a
nishchaya, a trust which knows no doubt. It is not a belief; belief is
always about doctrines. Trust is always about persons.</p><p>It is not what the master is saying that you believe; it is what the
master is that creates a nishchaya, a trust in you. And that trust will
start growing into a deep longing -- you would also like to enter into
the same world of awareness, into the same world of blissfulness, into
the same paradise where your master is.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU DO NOT NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN
IT</p><p>... your longing will just go on becoming deeper and deeper and
deeper. You will be waiting with tremendous love. You will not demand of
existence, "Give me this state," because any demand on existence is
ugly. You will simply wait; you will not even pray. You will simply feel
thirsty, and existence is compassionate enough. You cannot dominate it,
but if you are simply thirsty, you will find existence fulfills your
longing.</p><p>He has at least heard well!</p><p><br></p><p>YOU DO NOT NEED ADORNMENT, CULTIVATION, OR REALIZATION TO ATTAIN IT.
YOU MUST CLEAR AWAY THE STAINS OF AFFLICTIONS FROM ALIEN SENSATIONS THAT
HAVE BEEN ON YOUR MIND SINCE BEGINNINGLESS TIME, SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS
BROAD AND OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE ...</p><p><br></p><p>You can see the discrepancy! If you say that your mind is as open as
empty space, it is no longer mind. It is as if you are saying, "When
your fire is as cold as ice" -- then why call it fire? Just calling it
ice will be the right thing! But for an intellectual it is difficult; he
is simply collecting opinions. And nobody is going to raise a question,
because they don't know that he is committing a mistake either.</p><p><br></p><p>... SO THAT YOUR MIND IS AS BROAD AND OPEN AS EMPTY SPACE ...</p><p><br></p><p>How much space is there? Do you know? The whole universe is empty
space. The mind does not have the capacity to be so broad.</p><p><br></p><p>... DETACHED FROM ALL THE CLINGING OF THE DISCRIMINATING INTELLECT,
AND YOUR FALSE, UNREAL, VAIN THOUGHTS TOO ARE LIKE EMPTY SPACE.</p><p><br></p><p>But he goes on making the distinction that you should keep your good
thoughts.</p><p>In a state of absolute silence and peace there are no good thoughts,
no bad thoughts. Thoughts as such are a disturbance, whether they are
good or bad. The sinner may be having bad thoughts in his mind, and the
saint may be having good thoughts in his mind, but both are in the mind.
There is no qualitative difference between them.</p><p>The true sage, the buddha, has no mind at all. He lives without mind,
he acts without mind.</p><p>It comes from his very innermost being; hence, it has a quality, a
freshness, a great splendor. Thoughts are always dusty and old. The sage
always acts afresh, not out of any old thoughts; he responds to the
situation moment to moment. There is no need for him to think. It is
almost like a blind man: if he wants to go out of this auditorium, he
will have to ask, "Where is the way?" And then, with his walking stick,
he will find the way and go out. But you never even think about it when
you want to go out; you simply see the way out and you go. There is no
thinking involved in it, and certainly no walking stick.</p><p>I have heard about a blind man whose eyes were operated upon. He had
come with his walking stick, and after a few days the doctor opened the
bandage on his eyes and told him, "Now, slowly, slowly open your eyes.
Your eyes are perfectly good; now you can see."</p><p>He was amazed at what he had been missing, all the colors, the sun,
the moon, the stars, people's faces -- everything he had been missing.
He thanked the doctor, but out of old habit he took his walking stick.
The doctor said, "What are you taking that walking stick for? Leave
it."</p><p>But he said, "Without it how am I going to find my way?"</p><p>The doctor said, "You are an idiot. Now you have eyes, there is no
need to find the way; the way will be clear to you. Just put that
walking stick on that pile."</p><p>There were many walking sticks. All the people he had cured had come
with their walking sticks, and he had been collecting them as souvenirs,
showing how many people he had cured. And he said, "It is not only you!
Every blind man, when I cure his eyes, immediately picks up his walking
stick to start going out."</p><p>Unconscious habit ... too long he has had the walking stick; he
cannot believe that life is possible without it.</p><p>The same is the situation of all who have lived with the mind for
millions of lives. That has been their guide, whatever they wanted to
do. It is inconceivable for the mind that you can live even for a single
moment without it. But it is just a walking stick for a blind man.</p><p>There is far more consciousness beyond the mind -- so broad, so
spacious, so silent that you need not think. It simply goes on
responding. In the mind you have to think what to do and what not to do.
It is always a question of either/or.</p><p>The moment you are beyond mind there is no question of either/or. You
simply know what has to be done and you do it, and there is no
repentance, ever. You never look back, you never feel that you have done
something wrong -- you cannot do wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the reasons why I have not called Ta Hui the great Master.
I am simply calling him a great teacher; perhaps at the last moment he
became enlightened -- but at the last moment. These teachings were given
before it.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THIS WONDROUS EFFORTLESS MIND WILL BE UNIMPEDED WHEREVER IT
GOES.</p><p><br></p><p>He goes on using the word "mind" for "no-mind." Because he has been
collecting, and he has no inner criterion, you will come across many
contradictions. In the second sutra, which is called mindlessness ...
now what has happened to the mind that he was talking about in the first
sutra?</p><p><br></p><p>AN ANCIENT WORTHY HAD A SAYING: "TO LOOK FOR THE OX, ONE MUST SEEK
OUT ITS TRACKS. TO STUDY THE PATH, SEEK OUT MINDLESSNESS. WHERE THE
TRACKS ARE, SO MUST THE OX BE."</p><p><br></p><p>The ox is an old symbol in Zen tradition for the lost soul, the lost
self that you have forgotten all about. Mindlessness will show you the
path, will indicate to you the soul; it will become an arrow, and you
have simply to follow without any tension, without any effort.</p><p><br></p><p>THE PATH OF MINDLESSNESS IS EASY TO SEEK OUT. SO-CALLED MINDLESSNESS
IS NOT BEING INERT AND UNKNOWING LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE; IT
MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED</p><p><br></p><p>... Again he starts using the word "mind." This is the trouble with a
teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>IT MEANS THAT THE MIND IS SETTLED AND IMPERTURBABLE WHEN IN CONTACT
WITH SITUATIONS AND MEETING CIRCUMSTANCES; THAT IT DOES NOT CLING TO
ANYTHING, BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES, WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION;
WITHOUT BEING STAINED</p><p><br></p><p>... but it is still there. Then why did he start calling the sutra
mindlessness? The mind again comes in. It is settled, but that which is
settled can be unsettled any moment. It is imperturbable, but that which
is imperturbable can be perturbed.</p><p>That it does not cling to anything ... but it is there. And clinging
is an old habit; it can start clinging tomorrow, if not today. It can
fall back.</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT IS CLEAR IN ALL PLACES WITHOUT HINDRANCE OR OBSTRUCTION;
WITHOUT BEING STAINED.</p><p>If it is there, there is every possibility of its being stained.
Mindlessness is the right word to explain pure space, without any
possibility of falling back.</p><p><br></p><p>... YET WITHOUT DWELLING IN THE STAINLESSNESS; VIEWING BODY AND MIND
LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS ...</p><p><br></p><p>You can see his mind continuously wavering, because all these
statements he must have collected from different people. Some may have
been enlightened, some may have been just teachers, some may have been
just learned people. He has made a good collection -- but I can see that
there are inconsistencies in it, because I have a criterion within
me.</p><p><br></p><p>VIEWING BODY AND MIND LIKE DREAMS OR ILLUSIONS ...</p><p>If mind and body are illusions, then what is the need of making them
broad, making them spacious, making them non-clinging? If they are like
dreams or illusions, just wake up and they are finished. That
wakefulness is mindlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>... YET WITHOUT REMAINING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF DREAMS' AND
ILLUSIONS' EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. ONLY WHEN ONE ARRIVES AT A REALM LIKE THIS
CAN IT BE CALLED TRUE MINDLESSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>He is utterly messed up! He may have been helpful in bringing people
to the masters, but he himself is not yet clear on what he is
saying.</p><p><br></p><p>NO, IT IS NOT LIP-SERVICE MINDLESSNESS: IF YOU HAVE NOT ATTAINED TRUE
MINDLESSNESS AND JUST GO BY THE VERBAL KIND -- and that's what he is
doing -- HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE PERVERTED CH'AN OF "SILENT
ILLUMINATION"?</p><p><br></p><p>These people commit many mistakes because of their attachment to a
certain school. Now, he is attached to a certain school -- Mahayana also
has different sects. First Buddhism was divided into two sects, Mahayana
and Hinayana; then they started dividing into different sects. In all,
there are now thirty-six sects. A man of unenlightenment is continuously
trying to defend, to criticize, the other sects.</p><p>In China there has been a sect called "The Sect of Silent
Illumination." I don't see that there is any problem -- all illumination
happens in silence. Silence is the illumination. But people fight over
words: because they don't call it enlightenment, they call it
illumination, that has created a rift. But you can understand very
easily that both words mean the same. 'Illumination' or 'enlightenment'
-- both are simply declaring that darkness has disappeared. What you
choose to call it is immaterial.</p><p>"Just get to the root, don't worry about the branches" -- he must
have got this from an enlightened master. "Just get to the root, don't
worry about the branches," because once you have cut the root, the whole
tree will wither away. But just cutting the branches is not going to
help; the foliage may become, on the contrary, thicker.</p><p><br></p><p>EMPTYING THIS MIND IS THE ROOT.</p><p><br></p><p>Not just emptying ... in the first place, there is no way to empty
the mind. You don't have any control over your mind. It goes on in its
own way, filled with dreams and thoughts and emotions and feelings and
reactions, sadnesses, happinesses -- there is no way to empty it. How
are you going to empty it? From one side you will be emptying it, and
from the other side a great flow will go on coming in. The only way to
empty it is to go beyond it -- to become awareness.</p><p>Watch the mind, and the mind disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE YOU GET THE ROOT, THE FUNDAMENTAL, THEN ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGE
AND KNOWLEDGE AND ALL YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AS YOU RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES, THROUGH SO MANY UPSETS AND DOWNFALLS, WHETHER
JOYOUS OR ANGRY, GOOD OR BAD, FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE -- THESE ARE ALL
TRIVIAL MATTERS, THE BRANCHES. IF YOU CAN BE SPONTANEOUSLY AWARE AND
KNOWING AS YOU ARE GOING ALONG WITH CIRCUMSTANCES, THEN THERE IS NEITHER
LACK NOR EXCESS.</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the most important experiences of Gautam Buddha. He
says that if you are just in the middle of any two polar opposites --
find exactly the middle, neither lack nor excess</p><p>-- if you are exactly in the middle, you will go beyond.</p><p>The middle is the beyond.</p><p>If you go to the extreme, then you will start clinging to it; from
the extreme you cannot go beyond.</p><p>That was a great contribution to spiritual science and to humanity,
that the middle is the beyond. Just keep yourself balanced in the
middle, and suddenly you will see you have gone above both the extremes
-- neither good nor bad, neither ordinary nor extraordinary, neither
knowledgeable nor ignorant.</p><p>This beyondness is his nirvana. Just to think about it you will feel
an immense peace. Just visualize it and you will feel a great silence
descending on you. And this is only visualization</p><p>-- what will happen in actuality if you come to the middle? You
cannot conceive the ecstasy of it, the blissfulness of it, the
benediction of it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have chosen Ta Hui to help you understand the difference between
the teacher and the master, because many religions have lost their
masters. For example, Jainism in India has had no masters, no
enlightened persons at all, for centuries -- only teachers.</p><p>Without an enlightened being, the religion loses its soul. It is only
the small stream of enlightened people that keeps the religion breathing
and its heart beating, that keeps it alive, flowering.</p><p>And one enlightened person is not just a singular phenomenon; he
spreads his illumination all around. Wherever he is, he carries a
certain energy field, and whoever is receptive will be pulled into the
energy field. The teacher has no energy field. He is just repeating
mechanically like a parrot.</p><p>But Ta Hui was certainly a great teacher, because he collected ... he
went to dozens of enlightened masters. He was so young when he was
initiated into monkhood, and he gathered like a bee gathers honey from
thousands of flowers. So on the one hand he is very rich; he has brought
so much honey from different flowers. But on the other hand he is very
poor; he has not contributed anything from his own being. But I am happy
that at least in the end, at the very end of his life, he became
enlightened. His small verse is certainly of great beauty:</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

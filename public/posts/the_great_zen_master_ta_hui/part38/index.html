Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n36\nCompassion\n19 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO,\nA TALK TO THE ASSEMBLY (PART TWO)\nBUDDHA SAID, \"ONE MAY WISH TO REVEAL IT WITH COMPARISONS, BUT IN THE END THERE IS NO COMPARISON THAT CAN EXPLAIN THIS. SAYING IT'S BROAD AND VAST HAS ALREADY LIMITED IT -- TO SAY NOTHING OF WANTING TO ENTER THIS BROAD AND VAST REALM WITH THE LIMITED MIND. EVEN IF YOU MANAGED THEREBY TO ENTER, IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A LADLE TO LADLE OUT THE OCEAN: THOUGH THE LADLE IS FILLED, HOW MUCH COULD IT HOLD? NEVERTHELESS, THE WATER IN THE LADLE, BEFORE IT WENT IN THERE, WAS IDENTICAL TO THE LIMITLESS WATER (OF THE OCEAN). LIKEWISE, BECAUSE YOUR WORLD IS JUST THIS BIG, AND YOU FEEL SATISFIED WITH IT, THIS LIMITLESS WORLD ADAPTS TO YOUR CAPACITY AND FILLS IT UP. IT'S NOT THAT THE WATER OF THE GREAT OCEAN IS ONLY THIS MUCH.\"\nTHEREFORE BUDDHA SAID, \"IT'S LIKE THE GREAT OCEAN, NOT DEFERRING WHETHER MOSQUITOES OR TITANS DRINK ITS WATER -- ALL GET THEIR FILL.\"\nIt is the perennial problem: those who have known have come across an unbridgeable gap between their experience and their capacity to express it. What they have known is so vast that whatever they say is going to limit it, and to limit the unlimited is unforgivable. If they don't say anything, then too they are saying something. They are saying that nothing can be said.\nBut the experience is so glorious, so nourishing, so fulfilling that to say that nothing can be said about it is to show your uncompassion towards those who are not so blessed with the experience. Unless you say something, howsoever limited, millions will remain unaware that their potential was for the whole sky, and they remained limited in a small world. They never opened their wings into the sky, because they never thought that beyond the cage there exists anything else.\nTo let people remain unaware of their capacity to fly, and the infinity of the sky, is certainly unkind. This is such a dilemma: if you say something it is not right, and if you don't say something it is again not right. You have to say something, howsoever small. It may give someone a hint; perhaps it may not quench the thirst but it may provoke a search.\nIt may not quench the thirst but it may make you aware of it, that you are thirsty. Even to become aware of your thirst is a great beginning, because one cannot remain thirsty if one knows -- one is going to seek and search in every possible way. And the ocean of life is not far away. We are in it, we are part of it.\nThere have been two types of mystics in the world. One Gautam Buddha has called the arhatas. They have chosen to remain silent. They are absolutely committed to the truth and they are not going to compromise on any account. They will not say something which is not\nabsolutely right, they will not say something which is only approximately true, because the approximately true is nothing but a lie. They will not give an example because there is no parallel to their experience, there is no possibility of any comparison. Seeing the situation, one can understand why they have chosen to remain silent.\nBut there has been another category of awakened people, enlightened ones, who have tried, although their efforts have not been very successful. By their very nature, they cannot be. But even if one person in a million has become awakened by the efforts of a bodhisattva, the second category of enlightened people, the effort was worth making.\nThe arhatas also have an answer for this. They say that if one man in a million becomes awakened by listening to a bodhisattva, that man was destined to become enlightened whether the bodhisattva had spoken or not.\nI have been in a dilemma. You cannot deny what the arhatas are saying. They are saying the man has not become awakened from listening to you, because whatever you are saying is just a hint, far away; it cannot make anyone enlightened. And they have a certain reason for saying it, because people have become enlightened sitting by their side in silence, too. Nothing has been said, nothing has been indicated, but just the presence of the arhata, his silence, his peace, have proved contagious. Anyone who is receptive, available, open, has felt something which was not said, and has moved on the path. Not only has he moved ... many have reached to the ultimate.\nHence the arhata has also a reason for saying that there is no need to say anything. Those who can understand will understand even your silence, and those who cannot understand are not going to understand; you may go on for years and years speaking to them, and they will remain deaf. You may talk about light, but they will not open their eyes. You may try to excite them about the beauties of the ultimate, but they will go on postponing the journey.\nBut the bodhisattva has his own reasoning -- and perhaps both are right. The bodhisattva says that there are people who are just on the verge: just a little push and they may be transformed; just a little indication -- a finger pointing to the moon -- and they may be able to see. And anyway, even if nobody understands, it is still worthwhile to make the effort; at least it shows your compassion, at least it shows you are not unconcerned with the vast humanity which is groping in darkness. You have done whatever is humanly possible to do. If nobody hears it, if nobody listens to it, it is up to them -- but they cannot blame you. They cannot complain that you knew and yet you remained silent, that you should have made some effort to wake them up.\nThese two categories have been in conflict for centuries, and both have been so clear about their approach that not even a single arhata has been converted by the bodhisattvas, or vice-versa: not a single bodhisattva has been converted by the arhatas.\nMy own understanding is that this conversion has not happened because both have something absolutely true about their approach. One is committed to the truth absolutely; one is committed to love, to compassion absolutely. And both values, truth and love, are of equal significance.\nI think there is no need for any arhata to become a bodhisattva, or any bodhisattva to become an arhata. Perhaps both are needed. Perhaps people are needed to sing songs of that which cannot be said, and people are needed to remain silent, so silent that their silence itself becomes a magnetic force. Perhaps both have done immense service to humanity, the one by\nmaking different efforts -- through language, through devices, singing, dancing -- and the other by remaining absolutely centered, but available to anyone who knocks at his door.\nI don't see the conflict as it has been seen down the ages. Those who see the conflict are only learned people; they are neither arhatas nor bodhisattvas.\nI am reminded of a great master, Ma Tsu. His monastery was just opposite another monastery in the deep mountains, and the other master was absolutely antagonistic to the methods and to the teachings of Ma Tsu. One disciple of Ma Tsu was having difficult times with the master, because Ma Tsu used to hit, beat ...\nIt was known that once Ma Tsu had thrown a disciple out of the window and jumped on top of him. The disciple had a few fractures and Ma Tsu was sitting on his chest asking, \"Got it?\" And the strangest thing is that he got it! He never asked a question again! That simply shows he must have got it; since then he became absolutely silent.\nThe other master was very angry at Ma Tsu: \"What kind of things does he go on doing? He seems to be a crazy man!\"\nOne day a disciple who was meditating on a koan came in. He had been coming for many days and getting a beating. There are hundreds of koans in Zen -- strange puzzles. He was meditating on the famous koan, \"the sound of one hand clapping.\" Ma Tsu had said, \"Whenever you have found the sound, come to me.\"\nThe disciple meditated in the silence of the night, he heard the wind passing through the pine trees, and he jumped. He said, \"This is it!\" The sound was so sweet and of course so musical that he went to the master and told him that it is the sound when the wind passes through the pine trees ... The master hit him hard and said, \"Don't bring any idiotic answers to me, just go back and meditate.\"\nAnd this went on happening. One time he heard a cuckoo calling in the night ... so sweet, so overwhelming, so touching that he forgot all the beatings and went again. Finally he got tired. He had brought all the sounds possible, and no answer was being received, every answer was being rejected. An idea arose in his mind, \"Perhaps this is not the master -- at least for me. I am not saying that he is not a master, but at least he is not for me. I should try his opponent who is just nearby.\" And he went there.\nThe master asked him, \"You are a disciple of Ma Tsu, why have you come to me?\" The disciple described what had been going on for months: he brings new sounds and he gets only beatings. There is a limit to patience, and he has come here in search of truth, not to hear the sound of one hand clapping. \"Unnecessarily, I am being held back by this, and now I have almost exhausted every sound, but he goes on beating. I have come to you. Accept me as your disciple.\"\nThat master had never beaten anyone, but he gave this disciple such a beating that Ma Tsu's beating felt far better! The master said, \"You idiot! Just go back, your master is very compassionate. He only beats you, you need to be killed! Just go back.\"\nThe disciple said, \"My God! I have been in search of truth ... First these people go on talking about enlightenment, and when you get caught in their idea, then they do all kinds of strange things to you. This man has been known always to be against Ma Tsu, and he has never used the device of beating. Why has he done this to me? But certainly, if I have to choose between the two, Ma Tsu is better.\"\nHe went back, and Ma Tsu asked him, \"Where have you been?\"\nHe told the whole thing. He said, \"I have been beaten very badly. You beat very considerably, but that man is absolutely mad; he wanted to kill me!\"\nMa Tsu said, \"He is very compassionate.\"\nThe disciple said, \"This is strange. You are enemies, you have been quarreling for years. Everything that is said by one is opposed by the other -- but you both agree as far as killing a poor disciple is concerned!\"\nMa Tsu said, \"I have never said he is wrong, he has never said I am wrong; we are just different. He is an arhata; he simply lives in silence, and anybody who comes has to sit in silence with him. Years pass, and the other also becomes engulfed, overwhelmed, by the silence of the master. But very few people are capable of bearing such a long wait.\n\"I make every effort to create a shortcut for you. I am a bodhisattva. I trust that there is a possibility that something can be done to bring you towards truth. All these devices, all these teachings, have nothing to do with truth, but they have something to do with you. The effort is to destroy your clinging to the mind, the effort is to defeat your mind. The day your mind is defeated, the day you are free from the cage of the mind, our work is done; then you will know what truth is. Neither of us can give it to you. But still we differ: the arhata never makes any effort; I make every effort possible.\"\nIt is very difficult to say that one category of enlightened people should disappear. As far as I am concerned, both are equally valid and both enrich the existence.\nTa Hui is saying that truth is so vast that even to call it vast is to make it limited. It is oceanic, but even to call it an ocean is to give it boundaries. All words fail, no word is big enough. There is no possibility of any comparison; nothing comes close enough to being a comparison or an example.\nHe is quoting Gautam Buddha: BUDDHA SAID, \"ONE MAY WISH TO REVEAL IT WITH COMPARISONS, BUT IN THE END THERE IS NO COMPARISON THAT CAN EXPLAIN THIS.\"\nFor example, Jesus says God is love. This is a comparison, perhaps the best comparison. In human experience, love has a tremendously significant place; in its purity, perhaps love can give you a hint of what happens to the man who becomes realized, who comes to know the divinity of existence. But even love is not a right comparison according to Gautam Buddha. It is beautiful, but enlightenment is far beyond. Love is a beautiful flower, but it is just a flower, ephemeral; in the morning it blossoms, in the evening it is gone. It was beautiful when it was, but it is not eternal, it does not have immortality. It is beautiful and delicate, and one can enjoy its dance in the wind.\nIt is poetry to compare love with God or enlightenment, but it is not truth. There is no human experience which can explain that which goes beyond the human mind. It is simple, it is arithmetic; that which is beyond the human mind certainly cannot be compared with any experience of the mind.\nYou must have heard the ancient parable of a frog who had come from the ocean -- he was on a religious pilgrimage. On the way he found a small well, and just to have a little rest he jumped into the well. He was happy to find there another frog, and they started talking to each other. The frog of the well asked him, \"From where are you coming?\"\nThe stranger frog said, \"It is very difficult to describe. You will have to forgive me, because I am coming from a place which is beyond your comprehension. You have never left this well, and I am coming from the ocean.\"\nThe frog of the well certainly felt offended; this was not expected of a guest. He jumped halfway across the well and said, \"Is your ocean this big?\"\nThe frog from the ocean was in great difficulty. He said, \"Please, just drop this subject.\nThe ocean is so big that there is no way to measure it by your experience of the well.\" The frog in the well jumped the whole length of the well and he said, \"Is it that big?\"\nAnd the frog from the ocean said, \"You are forcing me to be unnecessarily unkind towards you, but I cannot say such a stupid thing that this small well of yours can be compared to the infinity of the ocean.\"\nThis was too much for the frog in the well. He said, \"You just get out! You are talking about this ocean only to humiliate me.\"\nThat's how people of the mind have always reacted to the people of meditation. People who have never been beyond their mind are always offended by the meditators, because the meditators are talking about the ocean ... and there is no comparison if you have lived only in the mind. If you have gone beyond the mind, there is no need of any comparison -- you know it yourself. Either you know it or you don't. There is no way to explain to the one who has never gone beyond the mind.\n\"SAYING IT IS BROAD AND VAST HAS ALREADY LIMITED IT -- TO SAY NOTHING OF WANTING TO ENTER THIS BROAD AND VAST REALM WITH THE LIMITED MIND. EVEN IF YOU MANAGED THEREBY TO ENTER, IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A LADLE TO LADLE OUT THE OCEAN: THOUGH THE LADLE IS FILLED, HOW MUCH COULD IT HOLD?\"\nOnce Gautam Buddha was passing through a forest and it was the season of autumn. The forest was full of dry leaves, and Ananda finding him alone, said to him, \"I have always wanted to ask, but before the others I could not dare. Just tell me the truth: have you told us everything that you know or are you still holding back a few secrets?\"\nAnd Gautam Buddha took a handful of leaves from the ground and said to Ananda, \"I have told you only this much -- the leaves that you see in my hand. But that which I know is as vast as all the leaves in this great forest. It is not that I want to hold it back, but it is simply impossible! Even to talk about a few leaves is an arduous effort, because it simply goes above your head. You know thoughts, but you have never experienced thoughtlessness. You know emotions, but you have never known a state where all emotions are absent, just as if all the clouds in the sky have disappeared.\n\"So I am trying my best,\" he said, \"but more than this is not possible to transfer through words. If I can make you understand only this much: that there is much more to life than words can contain; if I can convince you that there is something more than your mind knows, that's enough. Then the seed is sown.\" Otherwise all the efforts of the great philosophers of the world are LIKE TAKING A LADLE TO LADLE OUT THE OCEAN.\nIn fact, such an incident is on record. Plato, one of the greatest Greek philosophers -- the father of Western philosophy -- was walking on the beach, and he saw a naked man bringing\nout the ocean water in his cupped hands and pouring it in a small hole that he had made in the sand. Plato watched him; he was not aware that the other man was none other than Diogenes.\nDiogenes was, in the Greek tradition, a very strange fellow. In the Zen world he would have been accepted with great joy; he would have fitted perfectly well. But in the Greek tradition of reason, logic, philosophy, he was a strange fellow. But that was the first encounter between Plato and Diogenes, so he was not aware who this man was. Plato asked him, \"What are you doing?\"\nDiogenes said, \"I have decided to empty the ocean.\"\nPlato said, \"You must be mad! This cannot be done. Just by taking with your hands a cupful of water, even in millions of years you will not be able to empty the ocean.\"\nDiogenes said, \"My work is done. I wanted to show to you that even if you go on thinking about truth for millions of years you are not going to find it. Your effort to find the truth through mind is exactly the same as my effort to empty the ocean by taking cupfuls of water out of it.\"\nPlato was very much shocked, but he had nothing to say against the man. He simply asked, \"Are you Diogenes? -- because I wanted to meet you.\"\nOnce in the school where Plato used to teach, he had defined man as \"a two-legged animal.\" When Diogenes heard this he picked up a two-legged sea bird, took out all the feathers, and sent it with a disciple to the academy of Plato: \"I am sending a specimen of your definition. This is a human being, a two-legged animal.\" Since that time Plato wanted to meet that man ... and today Diogenes again had smashed his whole philosophical approach to existence!\nPhilosophy is nothing but a teaspoon. You can fill it up with ocean water ...\nBuddha is right when he is saying, \"THOUGH THE LADLE IS FILLED, HOW MUCH COULD IT HOLD? NEVERTHELESS, THE WATER IN THE LADLE, BEFORE IT WENT IN THERE, WAS IDENTICAL TO THE LIMITLESS WATER (OF THE OCEAN). LIKEWISE, BECAUSE YOUR WORLD IS JUST THIS BIG, AND YOU FEEL SATISFIED WITH IT, THIS LIMITLESS WORLD ADAPTS TO YOUR CAPACITY AND FILLS IT UP. IT IS NOT THAT THE WATER OF THE GREAT OCEAN IS ONLY THIS MUCH.\"\nTHEREFORE BUDDHA SAID, \"IT IS LIKE THE GREAT OCEAN, NOT DEFERRING WHETHER MOSQUITOES OR TITANS DRINK ITS WATER -- ALL GET THEIR FILL.\"\nYou can watch the ocean ... every day millions of rivers are falling into the ocean, but the ocean remains the same. Those millions of rivers pouring into it make almost no difference. And all the clouds that shower rain all over the earth are filled by the ocean. The sun rays are taking the ocean water into the clouds as vapor. Still that does not make any difference -- the ocean remains the same. Whether you add millions of rivers to it or you take all the water that all the clouds rain over the earth, it remains the same.\nThe UPANISHADS have a very strange but very true statement: The ultimate is so perfect that even if you take the whole out of it, it will still remain the same; or, if you can add the whole back into it, it won't be bigger -- it will still remain the same. All these statements are just to show that we are part of an existence which is infinite in all the dimensions. There are no boundaries to it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3772","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part38/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">36 Compassion</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3772 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part38.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part37>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

FEEL SATISFIED WITH IT, THIS LIMITLESS WORLD ADAPTS TO YOUR CAPACITY AND
FILLS IT UP. IT'S NOT THAT THE WATER OF THE GREAT OCEAN IS ONLY THIS
MUCH."</p><p>THEREFORE BUDDHA SAID, "IT'S LIKE THE GREAT OCEAN, NOT DEFERRING
WHETHER MOSQUITOES OR TITANS DRINK ITS WATER -- ALL GET THEIR FILL."</p><p><br></p><p>It is the perennial problem: those who have known have come across an
unbridgeable gap between their experience and their capacity to express
it. What they have known is so vast that whatever they say is going to
limit it, and to limit the unlimited is unforgivable. If they don't say
anything, then too they are saying something. They are saying that
nothing can be said.</p><p>But the experience is so glorious, so nourishing, so fulfilling that
to say that nothing can be said about it is to show your uncompassion
towards those who are not so blessed with the experience. Unless you say
something, howsoever limited, millions will remain unaware that their
potential was for the whole sky, and they remained limited in a small
world. They never opened their wings into the sky, because they never
thought that beyond the cage there exists anything else.</p><p>To let people remain unaware of their capacity to fly, and the
infinity of the sky, is certainly unkind. This is such a dilemma: if you
say something it is not right, and if you don't say something it is
again not right. You have to say something, howsoever small. It may give
someone a hint; perhaps it may not quench the thirst but it may provoke
a search.</p><p>It may not quench the thirst but it may make you aware of it, that
you are thirsty. Even to become aware of your thirst is a great
beginning, because one cannot remain thirsty if one knows -- one is
going to seek and search in every possible way. And the ocean of life is
not far away. We are in it, we are part of it.</p><p>There have been two types of mystics in the world. One Gautam Buddha
has called the arhatas. They have chosen to remain silent. They are
absolutely committed to the truth and they are not going to compromise
on any account. They will not say something which is not</p><p>absolutely right, they will not say something which is only
approximately true, because the approximately true is nothing but a lie.
They will not give an example because there is no parallel to their
experience, there is no possibility of any comparison. Seeing the
situation, one can understand why they have chosen to remain silent.</p><p>But there has been another category of awakened people, enlightened
ones, who have tried, although their efforts have not been very
successful. By their very nature, they cannot be. But even if one person
in a million has become awakened by the efforts of a bodhisattva, the
second category of enlightened people, the effort was worth making.</p><p>The arhatas also have an answer for this. They say that if one man in
a million becomes awakened by listening to a bodhisattva, that man was
destined to become enlightened whether the bodhisattva had spoken or
not.</p><p>I have been in a dilemma. You cannot deny what the arhatas are
saying. They are saying the man has not become awakened from listening
to you, because whatever you are saying is just a hint, far away; it
cannot make anyone enlightened. And they have a certain reason for
saying it, because people have become enlightened sitting by their side
in silence, too. Nothing has been said, nothing has been indicated, but
just the presence of the arhata, his silence, his peace, have proved
contagious. Anyone who is receptive, available, open, has felt something
which was not said, and has moved on the path. Not only has he moved ...
many have reached to the ultimate.</p><p>Hence the arhata has also a reason for saying that there is no need
to say anything. Those who can understand will understand even your
silence, and those who cannot understand are not going to understand;
you may go on for years and years speaking to them, and they will remain
deaf. You may talk about light, but they will not open their eyes. You
may try to excite them about the beauties of the ultimate, but they will
go on postponing the journey.</p><p>But the bodhisattva has his own reasoning -- and perhaps both are
right. The bodhisattva says that there are people who are just on the
verge: just a little push and they may be transformed; just a little
indication -- a finger pointing to the moon -- and they may be able to
see. And anyway, even if nobody understands, it is still worthwhile to
make the effort; at least it shows your compassion, at least it shows
you are not unconcerned with the vast humanity which is groping in
darkness. You have done whatever is humanly possible to do. If nobody
hears it, if nobody listens to it, it is up to them -- but they cannot
blame you. They cannot complain that you knew and yet you remained
silent, that you should have made some effort to wake them up.</p><p>These two categories have been in conflict for centuries, and both
have been so clear about their approach that not even a single arhata
has been converted by the bodhisattvas, or vice-versa: not a single
bodhisattva has been converted by the arhatas.</p><p>My own understanding is that this conversion has not happened because
both have something absolutely true about their approach. One is
committed to the truth absolutely; one is committed to love, to
compassion absolutely. And both values, truth and love, are of equal
significance.</p><p>I think there is no need for any arhata to become a bodhisattva, or
any bodhisattva to become an arhata. Perhaps both are needed. Perhaps
people are needed to sing songs of that which cannot be said, and people
are needed to remain silent, so silent that their silence itself becomes
a magnetic force. Perhaps both have done immense service to humanity,
the one by</p><p>making different efforts -- through language, through devices,
singing, dancing -- and the other by remaining absolutely centered, but
available to anyone who knocks at his door.</p><p>I don't see the conflict as it has been seen down the ages. Those who
see the conflict are only learned people; they are neither arhatas nor
bodhisattvas.</p><p>I am reminded of a great master, Ma Tsu. His monastery was just
opposite another monastery in the deep mountains, and the other master
was absolutely antagonistic to the methods and to the teachings of Ma
Tsu. One disciple of Ma Tsu was having difficult times with the master,
because Ma Tsu used to hit, beat ...</p><p>It was known that once Ma Tsu had thrown a disciple out of the window
and jumped on top of him. The disciple had a few fractures and Ma Tsu
was sitting on his chest asking, "Got it?" And the strangest thing is
that he got it! He never asked a question again! That simply shows he
must have got it; since then he became absolutely silent.</p><p>The other master was very angry at Ma Tsu: "What kind of things does
he go on doing? He seems to be a crazy man!"</p><p>One day a disciple who was meditating on a koan came in. He had been
coming for many days and getting a beating. There are hundreds of koans
in Zen -- strange puzzles. He was meditating on the famous koan, "the
sound of one hand clapping." Ma Tsu had said, "Whenever you have found
the sound, come to me."</p><p>The disciple meditated in the silence of the night, he heard the wind
passing through the pine trees, and he jumped. He said, "This is it!"
The sound was so sweet and of course so musical that he went to the
master and told him that it is the sound when the wind passes through
the pine trees ... The master hit him hard and said, "Don't bring any
idiotic answers to me, just go back and meditate."</p><p>And this went on happening. One time he heard a cuckoo calling in the
night ... so sweet, so overwhelming, so touching that he forgot all the
beatings and went again. Finally he got tired. He had brought all the
sounds possible, and no answer was being received, every answer was
being rejected. An idea arose in his mind, "Perhaps this is not the
master -- at least for me. I am not saying that he is not a master, but
at least he is not for me. I should try his opponent who is just
nearby." And he went there.</p><p>The master asked him, "You are a disciple of Ma Tsu, why have you
come to me?" The disciple described what had been going on for months:
he brings new sounds and he gets only beatings. There is a limit to
patience, and he has come here in search of truth, not to hear the sound
of one hand clapping. "Unnecessarily, I am being held back by this, and
now I have almost exhausted every sound, but he goes on beating. I have
come to you. Accept me as your disciple."</p><p>That master had never beaten anyone, but he gave this disciple such a
beating that Ma Tsu's beating felt far better! The master said, "You
idiot! Just go back, your master is very compassionate. He only beats
you, you need to be killed! Just go back."</p><p>The disciple said, "My God! I have been in search of truth ... First
these people go on talking about enlightenment, and when you get caught
in their idea, then they do all kinds of strange things to you. This man
has been known always to be against Ma Tsu, and he has never used the
device of beating. Why has he done this to me? But certainly, if I have
to choose between the two, Ma Tsu is better."</p><p>He went back, and Ma Tsu asked him, "Where have you been?"</p><p>He told the whole thing. He said, "I have been beaten very badly. You
beat very considerably, but that man is absolutely mad; he wanted to
kill me!"</p><p>Ma Tsu said, "He is very compassionate."</p><p>The disciple said, "This is strange. You are enemies, you have been
quarreling for years. Everything that is said by one is opposed by the
other -- but you both agree as far as killing a poor disciple is
concerned!"</p><p>Ma Tsu said, "I have never said he is wrong, he has never said I am
wrong; we are just different. He is an arhata; he simply lives in
silence, and anybody who comes has to sit in silence with him. Years
pass, and the other also becomes engulfed, overwhelmed, by the silence
of the master. But very few people are capable of bearing such a long
wait.</p><p>"I make every effort to create a shortcut for you. I am a
bodhisattva. I trust that there is a possibility that something can be
done to bring you towards truth. All these devices, all these teachings,
have nothing to do with truth, but they have something to do with you.
The effort is to destroy your clinging to the mind, the effort is to
defeat your mind. The day your mind is defeated, the day you are free
from the cage of the mind, our work is done; then you will know what
truth is. Neither of us can give it to you. But still we differ: the
arhata never makes any effort; I make every effort possible."</p><p>It is very difficult to say that one category of enlightened people
should disappear. As far as I am concerned, both are equally valid and
both enrich the existence.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying that truth is so vast that even to call it vast is
to make it limited. It is oceanic, but even to call it an ocean is to
give it boundaries. All words fail, no word is big enough. There is no
possibility of any comparison; nothing comes close enough to being a
comparison or an example.</p><p>He is quoting Gautam Buddha: BUDDHA SAID, "ONE MAY WISH TO REVEAL IT
WITH COMPARISONS, BUT IN THE END THERE IS NO COMPARISON THAT CAN EXPLAIN
THIS."</p><p>For example, Jesus says God is love. This is a comparison, perhaps
the best comparison. In human experience, love has a tremendously
significant place; in its purity, perhaps love can give you a hint of
what happens to the man who becomes realized, who comes to know the
divinity of existence. But even love is not a right comparison according
to Gautam Buddha. It is beautiful, but enlightenment is far beyond. Love
is a beautiful flower, but it is just a flower, ephemeral; in the
morning it blossoms, in the evening it is gone. It was beautiful when it
was, but it is not eternal, it does not have immortality. It is
beautiful and delicate, and one can enjoy its dance in the wind.</p><p>It is poetry to compare love with God or enlightenment, but it is not
truth. There is no human experience which can explain that which goes
beyond the human mind. It is simple, it is arithmetic; that which is
beyond the human mind certainly cannot be compared with any experience
of the mind.</p><p>You must have heard the ancient parable of a frog who had come from
the ocean -- he was on a religious pilgrimage. On the way he found a
small well, and just to have a little rest he jumped into the well. He
was happy to find there another frog, and they started talking to each
other. The frog of the well asked him, "From where are you coming?"</p><p>The stranger frog said, "It is very difficult to describe. You will
have to forgive me, because I am coming from a place which is beyond
your comprehension. You have never left this well, and I am coming from
the ocean."</p><p>The frog of the well certainly felt offended; this was not expected
of a guest. He jumped halfway across the well and said, "Is your ocean
this big?"</p><p>The frog from the ocean was in great difficulty. He said, "Please,
just drop this subject.</p><p>The ocean is so big that there is no way to measure it by your
experience of the well." The frog in the well jumped the whole length of
the well and he said, "Is it that big?"</p><p>And the frog from the ocean said, "You are forcing me to be
unnecessarily unkind towards you, but I cannot say such a stupid thing
that this small well of yours can be compared to the infinity of the
ocean."</p><p>This was too much for the frog in the well. He said, "You just get
out! You are talking about this ocean only to humiliate me."</p><p>That's how people of the mind have always reacted to the people of
meditation. People who have never been beyond their mind are always
offended by the meditators, because the meditators are talking about the
ocean ... and there is no comparison if you have lived only in the mind.
If you have gone beyond the mind, there is no need of any comparison --
you know it yourself. Either you know it or you don't. There is no way
to explain to the one who has never gone beyond the mind.</p><p>"SAYING IT IS BROAD AND VAST HAS ALREADY LIMITED IT -- TO SAY NOTHING
OF WANTING TO ENTER THIS BROAD AND VAST REALM WITH THE LIMITED MIND.
EVEN IF YOU MANAGED THEREBY TO ENTER, IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A LADLE TO
LADLE OUT THE OCEAN: THOUGH THE LADLE IS FILLED, HOW MUCH COULD IT
HOLD?"</p><p>Once Gautam Buddha was passing through a forest and it was the season
of autumn. The forest was full of dry leaves, and Ananda finding him
alone, said to him, "I have always wanted to ask, but before the others
I could not dare. Just tell me the truth: have you told us everything
that you know or are you still holding back a few secrets?"</p><p>And Gautam Buddha took a handful of leaves from the ground and said
to Ananda, "I have told you only this much -- the leaves that you see in
my hand. But that which I know is as vast as all the leaves in this
great forest. It is not that I want to hold it back, but it is simply
impossible! Even to talk about a few leaves is an arduous effort,
because it simply goes above your head. You know thoughts, but you have
never experienced thoughtlessness. You know emotions, but you have never
known a state where all emotions are absent, just as if all the clouds
in the sky have disappeared.</p><p>"So I am trying my best," he said, "but more than this is not
possible to transfer through words. If I can make you understand only
this much: that there is much more to life than words can contain; if I
can convince you that there is something more than your mind knows,
that's enough. Then the seed is sown." Otherwise all the efforts of the
great philosophers of the world are LIKE TAKING A LADLE TO LADLE OUT THE
OCEAN.</p><p>In fact, such an incident is on record. Plato, one of the greatest
Greek philosophers -- the father of Western philosophy -- was walking on
the beach, and he saw a naked man bringing</p><p>out the ocean water in his cupped hands and pouring it in a small
hole that he had made in the sand. Plato watched him; he was not aware
that the other man was none other than Diogenes.</p><p>Diogenes was, in the Greek tradition, a very strange fellow. In the
Zen world he would have been accepted with great joy; he would have
fitted perfectly well. But in the Greek tradition of reason, logic,
philosophy, he was a strange fellow. But that was the first encounter
between Plato and Diogenes, so he was not aware who this man was. Plato
asked him, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Diogenes said, "I have decided to empty the ocean."</p><p>Plato said, "You must be mad! This cannot be done. Just by taking
with your hands a cupful of water, even in millions of years you will
not be able to empty the ocean."</p><p>Diogenes said, "My work is done. I wanted to show to you that even if
you go on thinking about truth for millions of years you are not going
to find it. Your effort to find the truth through mind is exactly the
same as my effort to empty the ocean by taking cupfuls of water out of
it."</p><p>Plato was very much shocked, but he had nothing to say against the
man. He simply asked, "Are you Diogenes? -- because I wanted to meet
you."</p><p>Once in the school where Plato used to teach, he had defined man as
"a two-legged animal." When Diogenes heard this he picked up a
two-legged sea bird, took out all the feathers, and sent it with a
disciple to the academy of Plato: "I am sending a specimen of your
definition. This is a human being, a two-legged animal." Since that time
Plato wanted to meet that man ... and today Diogenes again had smashed
his whole philosophical approach to existence!</p><p>Philosophy is nothing but a teaspoon. You can fill it up with ocean
water ...</p><p>Buddha is right when he is saying, "THOUGH THE LADLE IS FILLED, HOW
MUCH COULD IT HOLD? NEVERTHELESS, THE WATER IN THE LADLE, BEFORE IT WENT
IN THERE, WAS IDENTICAL TO THE LIMITLESS WATER (OF THE OCEAN). LIKEWISE,
BECAUSE YOUR WORLD IS JUST THIS BIG, AND YOU FEEL SATISFIED WITH IT,
THIS LIMITLESS WORLD ADAPTS TO YOUR CAPACITY AND FILLS IT UP. IT IS NOT
THAT THE WATER OF THE GREAT OCEAN IS ONLY THIS MUCH."</p><p>THEREFORE BUDDHA SAID, "IT IS LIKE THE GREAT OCEAN, NOT DEFERRING
WHETHER MOSQUITOES OR TITANS DRINK ITS WATER -- ALL GET THEIR FILL."</p><p>You can watch the ocean ... every day millions of rivers are falling
into the ocean, but the ocean remains the same. Those millions of rivers
pouring into it make almost no difference. And all the clouds that
shower rain all over the earth are filled by the ocean. The sun rays are
taking the ocean water into the clouds as vapor. Still that does not
make any difference -- the ocean remains the same. Whether you add
millions of rivers to it or you take all the water that all the clouds
rain over the earth, it remains the same.</p><p>The UPANISHADS have a very strange but very true statement: The
ultimate is so perfect that even if you take the whole out of it, it
will still remain the same; or, if you can add the whole back into it,
it won't be bigger -- it will still remain the same. All these
statements are just to show that we are part of an existence which is
infinite in all the dimensions. There are no boundaries to it.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part37>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

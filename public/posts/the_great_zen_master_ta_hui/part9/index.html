EVEN IF YOU CAN TAKE IT UP WITH YOUR WHOLE BEING AT A SINGLE BLOW OR SHOUT, ALREADY YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF POWER -- IN FACT YOU HAVE BEEN DOUSED OVER THE HEAD BY SOMEONE ELSE WITH A LADLEFUL OF FOUL WATER. HOW MUCH MORE SO, IF AT A SHOUT OR BLOW YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MARVELS OR SEEKING SUBTLE UNDERSTANDING -- THIS IS THE STUPIDEST OF THE STUPID.\nTa Hui is a strange fellow, but he represents all those people who try to find their self-nature by intellectual effort. The problem with these people is that they have a good intellect. They can grasp words from masters, they can repeat them; they can deceive people and they can be deceived themselves.\nNow this is one of the most stupid sutras amongst all his teachings, and I will show you why I am saying that. As I go more and more into Ta Hui, I am wondering whether to call him a great teacher or just a pseudo teacher. A master certainly he is not; a teacher he may have been, but there are things which are even below the status of a teacher. He seems to be a pseudo teacher. He has not fulfilled even the qualifications for being an authentic teacher, just transmitting knowledge from the masters to the masses.\nHe cannot even understand what has been happening in the school of Zen. It is so special that a very rare insight is needed to comprehend it, and unless you have your own experience there will always remain something of a doubt in you.\nFor example, Zen is the only school in the world where the masters have slapped the disciples, hit them with their staffs, or even physically thrown students out of the window. Not only that, one master jumped on top of a disciple; sitting on his chest he asked, \"Got it?\"\nThe Zen master is mysterious in his working. People who simply read the anecdotes cannot make any sense out of them because they don't know the inner story which cannot be compiled in the anecdotes. It is a happening between the master and the disciple: it is the invisible transfer of energy.\nJust to give you an insight so that you can see the stupidity of Ta Hui ... An understanding of this man who has been thrown out of the window by Lin Chi, who then jumped on him and asked, \"Got it?\", needs the total background to the story and the intrinsic undercurrent running through it.\nThe disciple had been working for almost a year on a koan which is the most famous koan in Zen -- 'the sound of one hand clapping.' Now, there cannot be any sound of one hand clapping. You can go on clapping one hand, but sound is not possible. Sound is only produced when two things clash; if there is only one thing, sound is not possible.\nSo the first thing to understand is that a Zen koan is not an ordinary puzzle which can be solved. It needs a different approach -- not that of solution, but that of dissolution.\nThe poor student went, sat under a tree, thought about it, meditated -- what can be the sound of one hand clapping? Do you hear the cuckoo ...? He heard a cuckoo from a faraway bamboo grove. He said, \"This is it!\" -- so beautiful, so peaceful, bringing such joy. He rushed back and told the master, \"I have heard it. It is the song of a cuckoo.\"\nThe master slapped him and said, \"You idiot! I have told you to find out the sound of one hand clapping! What does a poor cuckoo have to do with it? Just go back and meditate.\"\nHe was very much puzzled, because his mind was searching for sounds -- which sound is it? One day he heard a breeze passing through the pine trees and he said, \"This must be it!\" And he rushed back ...\nThis went on for one year. He would find some sound, the sound of running water, and he would go back. A point came when the master had no need to hear his answer. The moment he saw him, he slapped him, and he would say, \"Go back.\"\nHe replied, \"But I have not even said anything ...\"\nThe master said, \"As long as you go on finding, you will not have found it. Just go back. I know you have brought some stupid sound again!\"\nThis was the student ... After one year, when he came in, the master saw that slapping was not going to do it -- he had been slapping him for one year continually! He just took hold of him and threw him out of the window. It was a two-story building ...\nIt was such a shock to the student. He was expecting a slap, but he was not expecting to be thrown from the window into a ditch. And besides that, the master jumped on top of him, so the few bones which had been left unbroken were now broken. He had multiple fractures! And on top of all that, the master was asking, \"Got it?\" The shock was such that his mind stopped\n-- it was so unexpected.\nMind stops only when there is something unexpected -- so unexpected that the mind cannot figure it out ... it stops.\nAbsolute silence ... and tears of joy in the eyes of the disciple. He touched the feet of the master and said, \"Why have you waited for one year? You could have done it on the very first day.\"\nThe master said, \"It would not have worked. I had to wait for the right moment, when you were ripe. You had worked hard with your mind. Your mind was tired, utterly tired; it had lost all hope that there is any possibility to find the answer. This was the moment when, if something unexpected happens to you, the mind may stop -- just for a single moment. And that's enough to hear the sound of one hand clapping.\"\nThe words are deceiving. It is not the sound of one hand clapping; it is the silence when the mind stops. Now anybody looking at the anecdote and not knowing the whole inner process -- just an outsider -- is bound to think this is simply stupid. But the disciple became enlightened, and it is always the end which decides whether the means were right or wrong.\nTa Hui is just an intellectual, so sometimes he repeats beautiful words. But here he has shown his reality, because he could not conceive any meaning in the stories and the anecdotes. I will go into them.\nYou must see the moon and forget the finger. This is so easy to repeat, because for the thousands of years since Gautam Buddha this has been one of the most important statements: the buddha only points the finger towards the moon.\nHis 'finger' means all that he says, all that he does, and it is only an indication -- a hint. You should not get too much attached to the finger, because the finger is not the point. What he is saying, what he is preaching, is not the point; it is only an indication. You should not get attached to the philosophy, you should not become a buddhist. You should look at the moon.\nAnd if you want to look at the moon, the most fundamental thing is to forget all about the finger. If your eyes are focused on the finger, how are you going to see the moon? Unless you move your eyes from the finger towards the faraway moon in the sky, it is not possible.\nBuddha was saying, \"Don't get attached to what I say, don't get attached to any doctrine, to what I preach; don't get attached to my personality. These are all just fingers pointing to the moon. Forget me, don't start worshiping me; just look at the moon. And once you have looked at the moon, I don't matter at all.\"\nIt is a very pregnant statement, and a very courageous one, to make to one's own disciples: \"Don't bother about what I say. I am not preaching any doctrine and I am not delivering to you\na system of beliefs or a philosophy. These are all devices to indicate the truth. It is beyond all words, but words can be used as a finger pointing to it. They cannot express it, but they can indicate it.\"\nIt is very easy to repeat it, but I don't think Ta Hui understands. You must see the moon and forget the fingers. don't develop an understanding based on the words. But that's actually what he has done. All his understanding is based on words.\nAN ANCIENT WORTHY SAID, \"THE BUDDHAS EXPOUNDED ALL TEACHINGS TO SAVE ALL MINDS; I HAVE NO MIND AT ALL, SO WHAT IS THE USE OF ALL THE TEACHINGS?\"\nThe quotation is perfectly right, but this is what Buddha means by saving: The understanding arising in you that you don't have any mind, that you are a no-mind. And then there is no question of saving. While you are attached to the mind you are in a bondage, and you need to be brought out of the bondage.\nSo the ancient worthy is right when he says, \"the buddhas expounded all teachings to save all minds. I have no mind at all\" -- he is a saved man -- \"so, what's the use of all the teachings?\"\nCertainly when you are saved there is no use. When you have seen the moon, what is the use of the fingers? When your disease is cured, what is the use of the medicine? Are you going to worship the bottle of medicine? Are you going to carry it wherever you go because it has saved you from a disease? The moment you are cured, you throw the medicine bottle; it is finished, its work is done.\nIt is almost as if you have a thorn in your foot: you take another thorn to take the first thorn out. The other thorn is as much a thorn as the first one, but you can manage to take out the first thorn with the other one. Now what are you going to do with the other thorn? Are you going to put it in the wound that has been created by the first thorn because it has saved you from that thorn? That would be utter stupidity -- then you still have what was wrong in the first place. No, once the first thorn is taken out, you throw away both the thorns together.\nAll teachings are just like that. The ancient worthy is saying it right, but Ta Hui does not understand what he is saying. He says,\n\"IF THEY CAN BE LIKE THIS WHEN READING THE SCRIPTURES, ONLY THEN WILL PEOPLE OF RESOLVE HAVE SOME COMPREHENSION OF THE INTENT OF THE SAGES.\"\nTa Hui is saying that you can understand what the sage has said only if you are reading the scriptures; only if you are a man of resolve and determination, a man of comprehension, will you be able to understand the intent of the sages.\nAll the words that he is using are not needed to understand the sages. What is needed is an experience. Not your comprehension, because all comprehension is intellectual; nor your resolve, because all resolve is of the mind; nor your reading of the scriptures, because that is\nall your intellectuality -- these things are not going to help you understand such a profound statement as, \"The moment you have seen the moon, forget all about the fingers.\"\nThis kind of statement can be experienced only through experience. Ta Hui has no experience at all, and that becomes very clear when he comes to the stories and sayings. Any intellectual, even today, will condemn Zen stories or simply laugh, thinking that perhaps they are just jokes, because they don't make any sense to the mind.\nTHESE DAYS IN THE CH'AN COMMUNITIES, THEY USE THE EXTRAORDINARY WORDS AND MARVELOUS SAYINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO QUESTION AND ANSWER -- CONSIDERING THEM SITUATIONS FOR DISCRIMINATION, AND BEGUILING STUDENTS. THEY ARE FAR FROM GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THEIR REALITY.\nWHEN PEOPLE ENGAGED IN MEDITATION READ THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHINGS, AND THE STORIES OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ANCIENT WORTHIES ENTERED THE PATH, THEY SHOULD JUST EMPTY THEIR MINDS.\nHe is not even aware that he goes on saying things in which he contradicts himself. Just look: when people engaged in meditation read the scriptures ... A man who is engaged in meditation does not need to read the scriptures, because whatever the scriptures contain is a faraway echo of somebody's meditation. And if you are yourself meditating, you are at the very source. Why should you bother about faraway echoes, corrupted, distorted by the interpretations of intellectuals, teachers, pedagogues, commentators?\nWhen you are at the very source yourself, you are at the very root from where all scriptures have arisen. A man of meditation has no necessity to read the scriptures and the teachings in the scriptures, but that is what Ta Hui is saying. Then immediately he says: ... and the stories of the circumstances in which the ancient worthies entered the path, they should just empty their minds.\nHow can you empty your mind when you are reading scriptures, teachings, and stories of how the ancient sages entered the path? you are filling the mind, not emptying the mind.\nMeditation empties the mind; studying anything only fills it. They are diametrically opposite to each other. But Ta Hui, in a single sentence, is bringing the whole opposition together, without ever being aware that what he is doing will be thought utterly idiotic by anyone who knows what meditation is.\nDON'T LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL MARVEL, OR SEEK ENLIGHTENMENT IN SOUNDS, NAMES, AND VERBAL MEANINGS.\nHow are you going to read the scriptures if you don't look for the verbal meanings? What other kind of meanings are there? In a scripture there are only words and nothing else; you can read the scripture only as verbal meanings.\nIF YOU TAKE THIS ATTITUDE, YOU'RE OBSTRUCTING YOUR OWN CORRECT KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ENTRY.\nHe has no idea that knowledge is the problem. One has to get free of it. It is not knowledge that gives you perception; it is knowledge that hinders your perception. It is removing the knowledge that clears the sky, just as when the clouds have moved there is absolute clear perception.\nBut this is bound to happen to a man who has been gathering things from here and there and who has not gone into meditation himself. Not a single thing shows that he has had any taste of meditation.\nP'an Shan said ... he quotes people because he has been going to teachers, masters; he must have been taking notes of what they were saying. He quotes many people.\nP'AN SHAN SAID, \"IT'S LIKE HURLING A SWORD AT THE SKY: NO TALK OF WHETHER IT REACHES OR NOT!\" DON'T BE CARELESS! VIMALKIRTI SAID THAT THE TRUTH GOES BEYOND EYES, EARS, NOSE, TONGUE, BODY, AND INTELLECT.\nI am simply amazed! This man quotes Vimalkirti, and Vimalkirti is saying, \"Unless you go beyond intellect and all your senses, you will not have the perception of reality, you will not know your self nature.\" But it does not strike him that he is simply working through the intellect.\nTE SHAN WOULD SEE A MONK ENTER THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY STRIKE HIM WITH HIS STAFF; LIN CHI WOULD SEE A MONK ENTER THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY SHOUT! VENERABLE ADEPTS EVERYWHERE CALL THIS \"BRINGING IT UP FACE TO FACE,\" \"IMPARTING IT DIRECTLY,\" BUT I CALL IT FIRST CLASS TRAILING MUD AND DRIPPING WATER. EVEN IF YOU CAN TAKE IT UP WITH YOUR WHOLE BEING AT A SINGLE BLOW OR SHOUT, ALREADY YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF POWER -- IN FACT YOU HAVE BEEN DOUSED OVER THE HEAD BY SOMEONE ELSE WITH A LADLE FULL OF FOUL WATER. HOW MUCH MORE SO, IF AT A SHOUT OR BLOW YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MARVELS OR SEEKING SUBTLE UNDERSTANDING -- THIS IS THE STUPIDEST OF THE STUPID.\nBecause he cannot understand, because he has no experience of his own, he calls it stupidest of the stupid. I will try to explain to you exactly what these people were doing. They were immensely successful, and they are not stupid. Ta Hui is the stupidest of the stupid.\nTe Shan is famous and a great master. A monk would enter the door and immediately he would strike him with his staff. You have to understand the situation. The master sees the disciple; he gives him a certain koan, an unsolvable puzzle. Then whenever he finds the right answer to it, he has to come and report to the master. Now there is really no answer for it -- so whenever a disciple enters to give him an answer, why waste time? He would simply hit him hard. He is making it as clear as possible that all answers are wrong, so there is no need to\nlisten to your answer. Although it looks very strange that you have not given the answer and he is hitting you -- if you were wrong, he could have hit you ... but you may have been right. But that is the problem: no answer is going to be right, only silence.\nSo it happened many times that the student will get hit -- many, many times. Then for a few days he will not appear, and Te Shan will enquire, \"Where is he?\" He will go to the place\n-- it was a big monastery, a beautiful Zen garden -- and he will find the disciple sitting under a tree, in utter silence. His face showed that the mind is no longer functioning, that there is no wavering inside, that everything is quiet and calm.\nAnd the same Te Shan who has been hitting this disciple will touch his feet. As he will touch his feet, the disciple will open his eyes and he will say, \"Master, what are you doing?\"\nTe Shan will say, \"I am touching your feet because you have found the answer. I suspected that something else had happened, because for many days you did not come. It happens that students only stop coming when they have found, because what to say? -- there is no answer. And they are enjoying their silence so tremendously ... they have forgotten the koan, they have forgotten the master, they have forgotten everything. They are living in such an ecstasy that everything is left far away.\"\nTe Shan used to find the disciples, and it always proved right -- his hitting had helped. His hitting finally made them aware that he is so compassionate and so loving, he will not hit unnecessarily. His hitting again and again shows only one thing: that whatever answer you have found is wrong. There is no need to hear it because there is no possibility of a right answer. By hitting he is making it clear that there is no possibility of a right answer; mind is absolutely impotent to give you the answer.\nSlowly, slowly, the disciple forgets about the koan, forgets about the sound, because it brings nothing but a hit from the staff of the master. But the moment he forgets the mind, and the koan, and the master, and the search for any answer, he falls into a deep, abysmal silence. That silence is the answer, but you cannot say anything about it. And it is so wonderful, mysterious ... you are so contented with it that there is no need for recognition from the master that you have found the answer. All these things have become trivia.\nBut Ta Hui does not understand it at all, and perhaps nobody -- not even the greatest philosopher in the world -- will be able to understand what kind of things these are. It looks simply absurd: first you give him a koan, and then you don't even listen to his answer. But it is a strategy, a strategy of great love and great compassion.\nThe master touches the feet and asks to be forgiven for all the hits that he has given ... he had to do it: \"There was no other way to destroy your stubborn mind, to destroy your clinging with the mind, to destroy the idea that you can find an answer through the mind. It was not only you that was hurt by my staff, I was hurt more. For all that I touch your feet, and I ask for your forgiveness.\"\nTe Shan was loved by his disciples even though he hit them with his staff; Ta Hui has no understanding at all.\nLin Chi would see a monk enter the door and immediately shout! Any intellectual will make a laughingstock of the whole thing. What is the point? -- you give the appointment to the student, to the disciple, to come to your room, and then you suddenly shout for no reason at all.\nIn my childhood I came across a man. His name was Sardar Chanchal Singh. He had been with Subhash Chandra Bose, a great Indian revolutionary, who had escaped from the jails of the British government. He had gone first in disguise to Germany to see Adolf Hitler, because he wanted to suggest, \"You are fighting with the British. We are also fighting them, and we need your help. If you can give us help, the British Empire can be attacked from two sides. We can attack from inside and you can go on attacking it from the outside.\"\nThe policy was absolutely clear ... and you will be surprised, Adolf Hitler never introduced any man to his armies the way he introduced Subhash Chandra Bose. He said to the armies, \"Respect this man more than you respect me, because I am a fuhrer of only a small nation; this man is a revolutionary and the leader of a vast continent.\" And he gave him -- although he was not in any political position -- a guard of honor.\nIt was Adolf Hitler and Subhash Chandra's plan ... they worked out that it would be better that Subhash Chandra went to Japan. In Japan there were thousands of Indian soldiers who were fighting for the British government against Japan.\nIt was a very clever policy: Subhash Chandra would go to Japan and Hitler would inform Japan -- because Japan was an ally with Germany against the British, against the Americans ... He would inform them, \"Allow Subhash to talk to all the Indian soldiers who are prisoners in Japanese jails. I have every certainty that this man is capable.\" -- and he was a man of immense charisma -- \"and that he will convince those soldiers, 'You are fighting for the British empire, which keeps your slavery intact. Instead, come with me, and we will make an army and fight against the British Empire.'\"\nIt was so logical and simple that the prisoners were ready. First ... if they are ready, they will not be prisoners any more; they will be guests of Japan. Secondly, they may have been fighting for the British, but deep down they were against the empire; just for their bread and butter, they had sold their souls.\nOnce Subhash told them, \"You have sold your souls ...\" then all the camps of prisoners were opened. A new army -- the Indian National Army -- was created by Subhash Chandra Bose. Sardar Chanchal Singh was one of the close colleagues of Subhash. He was also a prisoner. He had had a high post in the Indian army, and he also had a very high post in the Indian National Army that was going to attack from Japan.\nThey succeeded as far as Rangoon; they defeated the British armies. Even Calcutta started feeling the fear that after Rangoon the next attack would be on Calcutta. All British were removed from Calcutta, and people who had enough money all moved from there. Calcutta was a danger point.\nAt that very moment Germany was defeated. Atom bombs were thrown on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so Japan surrendered.\nSubhash was in a strange position. Now, both friends who were supporting him were defeated. He had a small army -- but although he was winning, how long could he go on? He could not even reach Calcutta, which was his home town. So he escaped from Rangoon ...\nIt is still a mystery what happened to him. There are stories that he has been seen in the Soviet Union; there are stories that he lives in Tibet; there are stories which seem to have been created by himself ... The plane he had taken from Rangoon fell in Taipei and burned. The pilot and somebody else -- nobody knows who the other man was -- were immediately burned,\nwithout any press conference or without any medical examination. They were already burned in the crash, and because they were both Hindus, they were put on a funeral pyre.\nMost probably, Subhash had been dropped somewhere else, and this plane was purposely burned to create the impression to the British Empire that Subhash was dead; otherwise he was enemy number one, to be caught dead or alive. So, this was a good fiction: he is dead, now there is no point ... and he has even been burned.\nTaipei gave out the report that he had been put on the funeral pyre -- but there was no point, the bodies were already burned, they were unrecognizable. They had not even photographed those bodies -- which is absolutely necessary for a man with the status of Subhash, for whom the British Empire was bloodthirsty. They should have taken photographs, they should have called medical people to examine the bodies. They should, in fact, have delivered the body to the British Empire. But my feeling is that it was not the body of Subhash; it was just a created facade. And that was the feeling of Sardar Chanchal Singh also.\nHe, by chance, met me in a restaurant in Jabalpur. He had been released from the Indian jail ... After Subhash left, all the Indian National Army people were again in jail -- but now they were in the jails of the British. But a case was fought for them, and Chanchal Singh was released. He was searching for employment, so I told him, \"If you have learned any martial arts in Japan, I can arrange a group of college and university students. You can teach them martial arts, and they will pay you enough so that you can survive until you can get other employment.\"\nI have told you about Chanchal Singh because he had learned from someone to shout exactly the way Lin Chi must have been shouting -- and I have heard him shout! I don't know Lin Chi -- he must have been more articulate in his shouting ... but even if this man Chanchal Singh shouted at you, your mind would stop immediately. If you were going to strike him with a sword, and he shouted, your hand would stop.\nHis shout was so deep, so much penetrating in you, that whatever you were doing you would simply stop. We had tried bringing wrestlers to hit him, to punch his nose. They were expert boxers, but the moment he would shout, their hands would just stop, close to his nose ... Something strange in his sound.\nJust jokingly we used to use him. somebody was urinating and we would say, \"Chanchal Singh, give a good shout.\" He would give a good shout and the urination would stop! The man would look all around -- what happened?\nI know perfectly well that there are many stories about Lin Chi, whose shout has awakened people, but it was not an ordinary shout. It was a certain training that enters into the deepest core of your being. The whole problem is that man is asleep. A good shout can wake him up.\nEven today, in the school of Lin Chi, the shout is being used. But it is not being used on every disciple -- only when a disciple has worked hard with his mind and his mind is tired. Those koans are so tiring because you know that they are absurd. But if the master says, \"Find the answer,\" and you have come to the master to become awakened, then you have to follow whatever discipline he gives you.\nThose shouts are given only when the mind is almost on the brink of failure, and it is the understanding of the master that now is the time. Then a disciple enters in Lin Chi's room, without expecting that he will shout like a lion's roar for no reason at all ... jump and shout as\nif he is going to kill the disciple. The disciple will remain just ... the whole mind stops. And just for a moment he can see his self-nature.\nThe question is not of time. If you know your self-nature, even for a moment, things become easy. Now you know the way. Now you know yourself, you can reach to it again and again. Now a shout is not needed every time; it was only an arbitrary device.\nBut Ta Hui condemns it because he does not understand the deep compassion, the psychology, the articulateness behind it. He proves himself to be an ordinary intellectual. Only in one thing is he right, when he uses the words stupidest of the stupid. But those words belong to him, not to Lin Chi, not to the master Te Shan.\nThese people were using absolutely new methods to awaken people. Their contribution is great. Zen has made more people enlightened than any other school of any other religion. Even in one monastery you can find many enlightened people. And this has been the only living current which has not stopped somewhere in the past; it is still alive. There are still people like Te Shan and Lin Chi, but they have fallen into obscurity.\nAmerica has corrupted the Japanese atmosphere completely; otherwise, Japan would be a totally different world. Its whole genius was concentrated on how to become enlightened. Now, under the American rule, their whole energy has been diverted towards money. And, they are people of great integrity, so great that now their money has the greatest value. Even the dollar, the American dollar, is left far behind. They are one of the richest nations in the world, and their money is more trustworthy than any other nation's currency. But this is not a success; it is a tremendous failure.\nAmerica has corrupted Japan's universities. What is being taught now in their universities is borrowed from America; they are completely imitating America, competing with America. Certainly they have made America afraid: although their products are very highly taxed when they enter America, still they are able to compete in the American market with American products, which are not taxed at all. The taxation has been going higher and higher to prevent the American market from being completely taken over by Japan.\nBut even though the Americans are raising the taxation on any import, Japan is still competing very well on every front in the American market. And America is absolutely impotent to compete in the Japanese market.\nThe Japanese work hard, work totally, work intensely. Their only problem is that they don't have much land to create more factories. So just a few days ago they have succeeded in floating an artificial island. On this artificial island they will be making factories. Once they succeed on one island, they will float many other islands. They are creating land for the first time.\nTa Hui does not understand. And this is the sign of a stupid person -- that without understanding anything, he criticizes it. Intellectuals are very willing to criticize anything that does not come within their comprehension.\nBut there are methods which work whether you can comprehend them or not. You should look at the ultimate result. Although the Japanese monasteries have fallen into darkness, still there are people who are working with devices which can create awakening.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5908","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 The source</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5908 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND DRIPPING WATER. EVEN IF YOU CAN TAKE IT UP WITH YOUR WHOLE BEING AT
A SINGLE BLOW OR SHOUT, ALREADY YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF POWER -- IN FACT
YOU HAVE BEEN DOUSED OVER THE HEAD BY SOMEONE ELSE WITH A LADLEFUL OF
FOUL WATER. HOW MUCH MORE SO, IF AT A SHOUT OR BLOW YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
MARVELS OR SEEKING SUBTLE UNDERSTANDING -- THIS IS THE STUPIDEST OF THE
STUPID.</p><p>Ta Hui is a strange fellow, but he represents all those people who
try to find their self-nature by intellectual effort. The problem with
these people is that they have a good intellect. They can grasp words
from masters, they can repeat them; they can deceive people and they can
be deceived themselves.</p><p>Now this is one of the most stupid sutras amongst all his teachings,
and I will show you why I am saying that. As I go more and more into Ta
Hui, I am wondering whether to call him a great teacher or just a pseudo
teacher. A master certainly he is not; a teacher he may have been, but
there are things which are even below the status of a teacher. He seems
to be a pseudo teacher. He has not fulfilled even the qualifications for
being an authentic teacher, just transmitting knowledge from the masters
to the masses.</p><p>He cannot even understand what has been happening in the school of
Zen. It is so special that a very rare insight is needed to comprehend
it, and unless you have your own experience there will always remain
something of a doubt in you.</p><p>For example, Zen is the only school in the world where the masters
have slapped the disciples, hit them with their staffs, or even
physically thrown students out of the window. Not only that, one master
jumped on top of a disciple; sitting on his chest he asked, "Got
it?"</p><p>The Zen master is mysterious in his working. People who simply read
the anecdotes cannot make any sense out of them because they don't know
the inner story which cannot be compiled in the anecdotes. It is a
happening between the master and the disciple: it is the invisible
transfer of energy.</p><p>Just to give you an insight so that you can see the stupidity of Ta
Hui ... An understanding of this man who has been thrown out of the
window by Lin Chi, who then jumped on him and asked, "Got it?", needs
the total background to the story and the intrinsic undercurrent running
through it.</p><p>The disciple had been working for almost a year on a koan which is
the most famous koan in Zen -- 'the sound of one hand clapping.' Now,
there cannot be any sound of one hand clapping. You can go on clapping
one hand, but sound is not possible. Sound is only produced when two
things clash; if there is only one thing, sound is not possible.</p><p>So the first thing to understand is that a Zen koan is not an
ordinary puzzle which can be solved. It needs a different approach --
not that of solution, but that of dissolution.</p><p>The poor student went, sat under a tree, thought about it, meditated
-- what can be the sound of one hand clapping? Do you hear the cuckoo
...? He heard a cuckoo from a faraway bamboo grove. He said, "This is
it!" -- so beautiful, so peaceful, bringing such joy. He rushed back and
told the master, "I have heard it. It is the song of a cuckoo."</p><p>The master slapped him and said, "You idiot! I have told you to find
out the sound of one hand clapping! What does a poor cuckoo have to do
with it? Just go back and meditate."</p><p>He was very much puzzled, because his mind was searching for sounds
-- which sound is it? One day he heard a breeze passing through the pine
trees and he said, "This must be it!" And he rushed back ...</p><p>This went on for one year. He would find some sound, the sound of
running water, and he would go back. A point came when the master had no
need to hear his answer. The moment he saw him, he slapped him, and he
would say, "Go back."</p><p>He replied, "But I have not even said anything ..."</p><p>The master said, "As long as you go on finding, you will not have
found it. Just go back. I know you have brought some stupid sound
again!"</p><p>This was the student ... After one year, when he came in, the master
saw that slapping was not going to do it -- he had been slapping him for
one year continually! He just took hold of him and threw him out of the
window. It was a two-story building ...</p><p>It was such a shock to the student. He was expecting a slap, but he
was not expecting to be thrown from the window into a ditch. And besides
that, the master jumped on top of him, so the few bones which had been
left unbroken were now broken. He had multiple fractures! And on top of
all that, the master was asking, "Got it?" The shock was such that his
mind stopped</p><p>-- it was so unexpected.</p><p>Mind stops only when there is something unexpected -- so unexpected
that the mind cannot figure it out ... it stops.</p><p>Absolute silence ... and tears of joy in the eyes of the disciple. He
touched the feet of the master and said, "Why have you waited for one
year? You could have done it on the very first day."</p><p>The master said, "It would not have worked. I had to wait for the
right moment, when you were ripe. You had worked hard with your mind.
Your mind was tired, utterly tired; it had lost all hope that there is
any possibility to find the answer. This was the moment when, if
something unexpected happens to you, the mind may stop -- just for a
single moment. And that's enough to hear the sound of one hand
clapping."</p><p>The words are deceiving. It is not the sound of one hand clapping; it
is the silence when the mind stops. Now anybody looking at the anecdote
and not knowing the whole inner process -- just an outsider -- is bound
to think this is simply stupid. But the disciple became enlightened, and
it is always the end which decides whether the means were right or
wrong.</p><p>Ta Hui is just an intellectual, so sometimes he repeats beautiful
words. But here he has shown his reality, because he could not conceive
any meaning in the stories and the anecdotes. I will go into them.</p><p>You must see the moon and forget the finger. This is so easy to
repeat, because for the thousands of years since Gautam Buddha this has
been one of the most important statements: the buddha only points the
finger towards the moon.</p><p>His 'finger' means all that he says, all that he does, and it is only
an indication -- a hint. You should not get too much attached to the
finger, because the finger is not the point. What he is saying, what he
is preaching, is not the point; it is only an indication. You should not
get attached to the philosophy, you should not become a buddhist. You
should look at the moon.</p><p>And if you want to look at the moon, the most fundamental thing is to
forget all about the finger. If your eyes are focused on the finger, how
are you going to see the moon? Unless you move your eyes from the finger
towards the faraway moon in the sky, it is not possible.</p><p>Buddha was saying, "Don't get attached to what I say, don't get
attached to any doctrine, to what I preach; don't get attached to my
personality. These are all just fingers pointing to the moon. Forget me,
don't start worshiping me; just look at the moon. And once you have
looked at the moon, I don't matter at all."</p><p>It is a very pregnant statement, and a very courageous one, to make
to one's own disciples: "Don't bother about what I say. I am not
preaching any doctrine and I am not delivering to you</p><p>a system of beliefs or a philosophy. These are all devices to
indicate the truth. It is beyond all words, but words can be used as a
finger pointing to it. They cannot express it, but they can indicate
it."</p><p>It is very easy to repeat it, but I don't think Ta Hui understands.
You must see the moon and forget the fingers. don't develop an
understanding based on the words. But that's actually what he has done.
All his understanding is based on words.</p><p><br></p><p>AN ANCIENT WORTHY SAID, "THE BUDDHAS EXPOUNDED ALL TEACHINGS TO SAVE
ALL MINDS; I HAVE NO MIND AT ALL, SO WHAT IS THE USE OF ALL THE
TEACHINGS?"</p><p><br></p><p>The quotation is perfectly right, but this is what Buddha means by
saving: The understanding arising in you that you don't have any mind,
that you are a no-mind. And then there is no question of saving. While
you are attached to the mind you are in a bondage, and you need to be
brought out of the bondage.</p><p>So the ancient worthy is right when he says, "the buddhas expounded
all teachings to save all minds. I have no mind at all" -- he is a saved
man -- "so, what's the use of all the teachings?"</p><p>Certainly when you are saved there is no use. When you have seen the
moon, what is the use of the fingers? When your disease is cured, what
is the use of the medicine? Are you going to worship the bottle of
medicine? Are you going to carry it wherever you go because it has saved
you from a disease? The moment you are cured, you throw the medicine
bottle; it is finished, its work is done.</p><p>It is almost as if you have a thorn in your foot: you take another
thorn to take the first thorn out. The other thorn is as much a thorn as
the first one, but you can manage to take out the first thorn with the
other one. Now what are you going to do with the other thorn? Are you
going to put it in the wound that has been created by the first thorn
because it has saved you from that thorn? That would be utter stupidity
-- then you still have what was wrong in the first place. No, once the
first thorn is taken out, you throw away both the thorns together.</p><p>All teachings are just like that. The ancient worthy is saying it
right, but Ta Hui does not understand what he is saying. He says,</p><p><br></p><p>"IF THEY CAN BE LIKE THIS WHEN READING THE SCRIPTURES, ONLY THEN WILL
PEOPLE OF RESOLVE HAVE SOME COMPREHENSION OF THE INTENT OF THE
SAGES."</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui is saying that you can understand what the sage has said only
if you are reading the scriptures; only if you are a man of resolve and
determination, a man of comprehension, will you be able to understand
the intent of the sages.</p><p>All the words that he is using are not needed to understand the
sages. What is needed is an experience. Not your comprehension, because
all comprehension is intellectual; nor your resolve, because all resolve
is of the mind; nor your reading of the scriptures, because that is</p><p>all your intellectuality -- these things are not going to help you
understand such a profound statement as, "The moment you have seen the
moon, forget all about the fingers."</p><p>This kind of statement can be experienced only through experience. Ta
Hui has no experience at all, and that becomes very clear when he comes
to the stories and sayings. Any intellectual, even today, will condemn
Zen stories or simply laugh, thinking that perhaps they are just jokes,
because they don't make any sense to the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE DAYS IN THE CH'AN COMMUNITIES, THEY USE THE EXTRAORDINARY WORDS
AND MARVELOUS SAYINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO QUESTION AND ANSWER --

THEY ARE FAR FROM GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THEIR REALITY.</p><p>WHEN PEOPLE ENGAGED IN MEDITATION READ THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHINGS, AND
THE STORIES OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ANCIENT WORTHIES ENTERED
THE PATH, THEY SHOULD JUST EMPTY THEIR MINDS.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not even aware that he goes on saying things in which he
contradicts himself. Just look: when people engaged in meditation read
the scriptures ... A man who is engaged in meditation does not need to
read the scriptures, because whatever the scriptures contain is a
faraway echo of somebody's meditation. And if you are yourself
meditating, you are at the very source. Why should you bother about
faraway echoes, corrupted, distorted by the interpretations of
intellectuals, teachers, pedagogues, commentators?</p><p>When you are at the very source yourself, you are at the very root
from where all scriptures have arisen. A man of meditation has no
necessity to read the scriptures and the teachings in the scriptures,
but that is what Ta Hui is saying. Then immediately he says: ... and the
stories of the circumstances in which the ancient worthies entered the
path, they should just empty their minds.</p><p>How can you empty your mind when you are reading scriptures,
teachings, and stories of how the ancient sages entered the path? you
are filling the mind, not emptying the mind.</p><p>Meditation empties the mind; studying anything only fills it. They
are diametrically opposite to each other. But Ta Hui, in a single
sentence, is bringing the whole opposition together, without ever being
aware that what he is doing will be thought utterly idiotic by anyone
who knows what meditation is.</p><p><br></p><p>DON'T LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL MARVEL, OR SEEK ENLIGHTENMENT IN SOUNDS,
NAMES, AND VERBAL MEANINGS.</p><p>How are you going to read the scriptures if you don't look for the
verbal meanings? What other kind of meanings are there? In a scripture
there are only words and nothing else; you can read the scripture only
as verbal meanings.</p><p>IF YOU TAKE THIS ATTITUDE, YOU'RE OBSTRUCTING YOUR OWN CORRECT
KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ENTRY.</p><p><br></p><p>He has no idea that knowledge is the problem. One has to get free of
it. It is not knowledge that gives you perception; it is knowledge that
hinders your perception. It is removing the knowledge that clears the
sky, just as when the clouds have moved there is absolute clear
perception.</p><p>But this is bound to happen to a man who has been gathering things
from here and there and who has not gone into meditation himself. Not a
single thing shows that he has had any taste of meditation.</p><p>P'an Shan said ... he quotes people because he has been going to
teachers, masters; he must have been taking notes of what they were
saying. He quotes many people.</p><p><br></p><p>P'AN SHAN SAID, "IT'S LIKE HURLING A SWORD AT THE SKY: NO TALK OF
WHETHER IT REACHES OR NOT!" DON'T BE CARELESS! VIMALKIRTI SAID THAT THE
TRUTH GOES BEYOND EYES, EARS, NOSE, TONGUE, BODY, AND INTELLECT.</p><p><br></p><p>I am simply amazed! This man quotes Vimalkirti, and Vimalkirti is
saying, "Unless you go beyond intellect and all your senses, you will
not have the perception of reality, you will not know your self nature."
But it does not strike him that he is simply working through the
intellect.</p><p><br></p><p>TE SHAN WOULD SEE A MONK ENTER THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY STRIKE HIM
WITH HIS STAFF; LIN CHI WOULD SEE A MONK ENTER THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY
SHOUT! VENERABLE ADEPTS EVERYWHERE CALL THIS "BRINGING IT UP FACE TO
FACE," "IMPARTING IT DIRECTLY," BUT I CALL IT FIRST CLASS TRAILING MUD
AND DRIPPING WATER. EVEN IF YOU CAN TAKE IT UP WITH YOUR WHOLE BEING AT
A SINGLE BLOW OR SHOUT, ALREADY YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF POWER -- IN FACT

FOUL WATER. HOW MUCH MORE SO, IF AT A SHOUT OR BLOW YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
MARVELS OR SEEKING SUBTLE UNDERSTANDING -- THIS IS THE STUPIDEST OF THE
STUPID.</p><p><br></p><p>Because he cannot understand, because he has no experience of his
own, he calls it stupidest of the stupid. I will try to explain to you
exactly what these people were doing. They were immensely successful,
and they are not stupid. Ta Hui is the stupidest of the stupid.</p><p>Te Shan is famous and a great master. A monk would enter the door and
immediately he would strike him with his staff. You have to understand
the situation. The master sees the disciple; he gives him a certain
koan, an unsolvable puzzle. Then whenever he finds the right answer to
it, he has to come and report to the master. Now there is really no
answer for it -- so whenever a disciple enters to give him an answer,
why waste time? He would simply hit him hard. He is making it as clear
as possible that all answers are wrong, so there is no need to</p><p>listen to your answer. Although it looks very strange that you have
not given the answer and he is hitting you -- if you were wrong, he
could have hit you ... but you may have been right. But that is the
problem: no answer is going to be right, only silence.</p><p>So it happened many times that the student will get hit -- many, many
times. Then for a few days he will not appear, and Te Shan will enquire,
"Where is he?" He will go to the place</p><p>-- it was a big monastery, a beautiful Zen garden -- and he will find
the disciple sitting under a tree, in utter silence. His face showed
that the mind is no longer functioning, that there is no wavering
inside, that everything is quiet and calm.</p><p>And the same Te Shan who has been hitting this disciple will touch
his feet. As he will touch his feet, the disciple will open his eyes and
he will say, "Master, what are you doing?"</p><p>Te Shan will say, "I am touching your feet because you have found the
answer. I suspected that something else had happened, because for many
days you did not come. It happens that students only stop coming when
they have found, because what to say? -- there is no answer. And they
are enjoying their silence so tremendously ... they have forgotten the
koan, they have forgotten the master, they have forgotten everything.
They are living in such an ecstasy that everything is left far
away."</p><p>Te Shan used to find the disciples, and it always proved right -- his
hitting had helped. His hitting finally made them aware that he is so
compassionate and so loving, he will not hit unnecessarily. His hitting
again and again shows only one thing: that whatever answer you have
found is wrong. There is no need to hear it because there is no
possibility of a right answer. By hitting he is making it clear that
there is no possibility of a right answer; mind is absolutely impotent
to give you the answer.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, the disciple forgets about the koan, forgets about
the sound, because it brings nothing but a hit from the staff of the
master. But the moment he forgets the mind, and the koan, and the
master, and the search for any answer, he falls into a deep, abysmal
silence. That silence is the answer, but you cannot say anything about
it. And it is so wonderful, mysterious ... you are so contented with it
that there is no need for recognition from the master that you have
found the answer. All these things have become trivia.</p><p>But Ta Hui does not understand it at all, and perhaps nobody -- not
even the greatest philosopher in the world -- will be able to understand
what kind of things these are. It looks simply absurd: first you give
him a koan, and then you don't even listen to his answer. But it is a
strategy, a strategy of great love and great compassion.</p><p>The master touches the feet and asks to be forgiven for all the hits
that he has given ... he had to do it: "There was no other way to
destroy your stubborn mind, to destroy your clinging with the mind, to
destroy the idea that you can find an answer through the mind. It was
not only you that was hurt by my staff, I was hurt more. For all that I
touch your feet, and I ask for your forgiveness."</p><p>Te Shan was loved by his disciples even though he hit them with his
staff; Ta Hui has no understanding at all.</p><p>Lin Chi would see a monk enter the door and immediately shout! Any
intellectual will make a laughingstock of the whole thing. What is the
point? -- you give the appointment to the student, to the disciple, to
come to your room, and then you suddenly shout for no reason at all.</p><p>In my childhood I came across a man. His name was Sardar Chanchal
Singh. He had been with Subhash Chandra Bose, a great Indian
revolutionary, who had escaped from the jails of the British government.
He had gone first in disguise to Germany to see Adolf Hitler, because he
wanted to suggest, "You are fighting with the British. We are also
fighting them, and we need your help. If you can give us help, the
British Empire can be attacked from two sides. We can attack from inside
and you can go on attacking it from the outside."</p><p>The policy was absolutely clear ... and you will be surprised, Adolf
Hitler never introduced any man to his armies the way he introduced
Subhash Chandra Bose. He said to the armies, "Respect this man more than
you respect me, because I am a fuhrer of only a small nation; this man
is a revolutionary and the leader of a vast continent." And he gave him
-- although he was not in any political position -- a guard of
honor.</p><p>It was Adolf Hitler and Subhash Chandra's plan ... they worked out
that it would be better that Subhash Chandra went to Japan. In Japan
there were thousands of Indian soldiers who were fighting for the
British government against Japan.</p><p>It was a very clever policy: Subhash Chandra would go to Japan and
Hitler would inform Japan -- because Japan was an ally with Germany
against the British, against the Americans ... He would inform them,
"Allow Subhash to talk to all the Indian soldiers who are prisoners in
Japanese jails. I have every certainty that this man is capable." -- and
he was a man of immense charisma -- "and that he will convince those
soldiers, 'You are fighting for the British empire, which keeps your
slavery intact. Instead, come with me, and we will make an army and
fight against the British Empire.'"</p><p>It was so logical and simple that the prisoners were ready. First ...
if they are ready, they will not be prisoners any more; they will be
guests of Japan. Secondly, they may have been fighting for the British,
but deep down they were against the empire; just for their bread and
butter, they had sold their souls.</p><p>Once Subhash told them, "You have sold your souls ..." then all the
camps of prisoners were opened. A new army -- the Indian National Army
-- was created by Subhash Chandra Bose. Sardar Chanchal Singh was one of
the close colleagues of Subhash. He was also a prisoner. He had had a
high post in the Indian army, and he also had a very high post in the
Indian National Army that was going to attack from Japan.</p><p>They succeeded as far as Rangoon; they defeated the British armies.
Even Calcutta started feeling the fear that after Rangoon the next
attack would be on Calcutta. All British were removed from Calcutta, and
people who had enough money all moved from there. Calcutta was a danger
point.</p><p>At that very moment Germany was defeated. Atom bombs were thrown on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so Japan surrendered.</p><p>Subhash was in a strange position. Now, both friends who were
supporting him were defeated. He had a small army -- but although he was
winning, how long could he go on? He could not even reach Calcutta,
which was his home town. So he escaped from Rangoon ...</p><p>It is still a mystery what happened to him. There are stories that he
has been seen in the Soviet Union; there are stories that he lives in
Tibet; there are stories which seem to have been created by himself ...
The plane he had taken from Rangoon fell in Taipei and burned. The pilot
and somebody else -- nobody knows who the other man was -- were
immediately burned,</p><p>without any press conference or without any medical examination. They
were already burned in the crash, and because they were both Hindus,
they were put on a funeral pyre.</p><p>Most probably, Subhash had been dropped somewhere else, and this
plane was purposely burned to create the impression to the British
Empire that Subhash was dead; otherwise he was enemy number one, to be
caught dead or alive. So, this was a good fiction: he is dead, now there
is no point ... and he has even been burned.</p><p>Taipei gave out the report that he had been put on the funeral pyre
-- but there was no point, the bodies were already burned, they were
unrecognizable. They had not even photographed those bodies -- which is
absolutely necessary for a man with the status of Subhash, for whom the
British Empire was bloodthirsty. They should have taken photographs,
they should have called medical people to examine the bodies. They
should, in fact, have delivered the body to the British Empire. But my
feeling is that it was not the body of Subhash; it was just a created
facade. And that was the feeling of Sardar Chanchal Singh also.</p><p>He, by chance, met me in a restaurant in Jabalpur. He had been
released from the Indian jail ... After Subhash left, all the Indian
National Army people were again in jail -- but now they were in the
jails of the British. But a case was fought for them, and Chanchal Singh
was released. He was searching for employment, so I told him, "If you
have learned any martial arts in Japan, I can arrange a group of college
and university students. You can teach them martial arts, and they will
pay you enough so that you can survive until you can get other
employment."</p><p>I have told you about Chanchal Singh because he had learned from
someone to shout exactly the way Lin Chi must have been shouting -- and
I have heard him shout! I don't know Lin Chi -- he must have been more
articulate in his shouting ... but even if this man Chanchal Singh
shouted at you, your mind would stop immediately. If you were going to
strike him with a sword, and he shouted, your hand would stop.</p><p>His shout was so deep, so much penetrating in you, that whatever you
were doing you would simply stop. We had tried bringing wrestlers to hit
him, to punch his nose. They were expert boxers, but the moment he would
shout, their hands would just stop, close to his nose ... Something
strange in his sound.</p><p>Just jokingly we used to use him. somebody was urinating and we would
say, "Chanchal Singh, give a good shout." He would give a good shout and
the urination would stop! The man would look all around -- what
happened?</p><p>I know perfectly well that there are many stories about Lin Chi,
whose shout has awakened people, but it was not an ordinary shout. It
was a certain training that enters into the deepest core of your being.
The whole problem is that man is asleep. A good shout can wake him
up.</p><p>Even today, in the school of Lin Chi, the shout is being used. But it
is not being used on every disciple -- only when a disciple has worked
hard with his mind and his mind is tired. Those koans are so tiring
because you know that they are absurd. But if the master says, "Find the
answer," and you have come to the master to become awakened, then you
have to follow whatever discipline he gives you.</p><p>Those shouts are given only when the mind is almost on the brink of
failure, and it is the understanding of the master that now is the time.
Then a disciple enters in Lin Chi's room, without expecting that he will
shout like a lion's roar for no reason at all ... jump and shout as</p><p>if he is going to kill the disciple. The disciple will remain just
... the whole mind stops. And just for a moment he can see his
self-nature.</p><p>The question is not of time. If you know your self-nature, even for a
moment, things become easy. Now you know the way. Now you know yourself,
you can reach to it again and again. Now a shout is not needed every
time; it was only an arbitrary device.</p><p>But Ta Hui condemns it because he does not understand the deep
compassion, the psychology, the articulateness behind it. He proves
himself to be an ordinary intellectual. Only in one thing is he right,
when he uses the words stupidest of the stupid. But those words belong
to him, not to Lin Chi, not to the master Te Shan.</p><p>These people were using absolutely new methods to awaken people.
Their contribution is great. Zen has made more people enlightened than
any other school of any other religion. Even in one monastery you can
find many enlightened people. And this has been the only living current
which has not stopped somewhere in the past; it is still alive. There
are still people like Te Shan and Lin Chi, but they have fallen into
obscurity.</p><p>America has corrupted the Japanese atmosphere completely; otherwise,
Japan would be a totally different world. Its whole genius was
concentrated on how to become enlightened. Now, under the American rule,
their whole energy has been diverted towards money. And, they are people
of great integrity, so great that now their money has the greatest
value. Even the dollar, the American dollar, is left far behind. They
are one of the richest nations in the world, and their money is more
trustworthy than any other nation's currency. But this is not a success;
it is a tremendous failure.</p><p>America has corrupted Japan's universities. What is being taught now
in their universities is borrowed from America; they are completely
imitating America, competing with America. Certainly they have made
America afraid: although their products are very highly taxed when they
enter America, still they are able to compete in the American market
with American products, which are not taxed at all. The taxation has
been going higher and higher to prevent the American market from being
completely taken over by Japan.</p><p>But even though the Americans are raising the taxation on any import,
Japan is still competing very well on every front in the American
market. And America is absolutely impotent to compete in the Japanese
market.</p><p>The Japanese work hard, work totally, work intensely. Their only
problem is that they don't have much land to create more factories. So
just a few days ago they have succeeded in floating an artificial
island. On this artificial island they will be making factories. Once
they succeed on one island, they will float many other islands. They are
creating land for the first time.</p><p>Ta Hui does not understand. And this is the sign of a stupid person
-- that without understanding anything, he criticizes it. Intellectuals
are very willing to criticize anything that does not come within their
comprehension.</p><p>But there are methods which work whether you can comprehend them or
not. You should look at the ultimate result. Although the Japanese
monasteries have fallen into darkness, still there are people who are
working with devices which can create awakening.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Become part of the great affair. On this pilgrimage from here to here, just be thoroughgoing; half-heartedness will not do. And then even in a single moment one can become enlightened -- because one is already enlightened.\nYou just have to gather yourself. You have fallen apart: your hand is lying here, your leg is lying there, somebody is playing football with your head. You have just to put yourself together. And once you are together, there is nothing more to achieve. But you yourself go on splitting yourself, dividing yourself.\nI have heard ... a thief was brought into the court. He was a famous thief, and the magistrate said, \"You are such an experienced man. What was the reason that you entered into the house, remained there the whole night, did not steal anything, and yet, got caught?\"\nHe said, \"It is a strange story. First I want to ask you one thing: that if you want to send me to the gallows, you can; but don't give me one sentence, and that is to have two wives.\"\nThe magistrate said, \"But there is no punishment like having two wives.\"\nThe thief said, \"That's very good. That's what happened. I entered into this house, and this man has two wives. One wife lives on the ground floor and the other wife lives on the first floor. They both dragged this man on the staircase, and the drama was so great that I forgot completely for what I had come.\" It was so pitiable! Somehow one woman would pull him upstairs, and as he was reaching, the other woman would come and start dragging him downwards. This went on the whole night, and I could not escape because I was inside the house and all the three people were awake, and I could not steal anything because the scene was so hilarious.\"\nBut if you look at yourself, do you know how many wives you have? how many husbands you have? in how many places you have left your parts? how many desires, how many ambitions? You have cut yourself into pieces. You have behaved like a butcher with yourself.\nAll the teaching of the awakened people is simply one: Be integrated. Come together. Find out all your parts and get crystallized. Become one.\nIn this oneness is your realization, the end of the world of darkness and the beginning of the world of light, truth, blissfulness ... and much more that has no words to be expressed.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n31\nRelease\n17 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, RELEASE\nIN OUR FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. IT WOULDN'T HELP EVEN IF THE SKY BECAME MY MOUTH, AND GRASS, TREES, PEBBLES, AND STONES ALL EMITTED LIGHT TO HELP ME EXPOUND THE TRUTH. THUS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THING CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED AND CANNOT BE STUDIED: IT REQUIRES ONE'S OWN REALIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT.\nBE SURE TO REMEMBER THE WORDS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY: \"IN PRINCIPLE, IT'S SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO CLEAR EVERYTHING AWAY. IN THE EVENT, PHENOMENA ARE NOT SUDDENLY REMOVED BUT EXHAUSTED GRADUALLY.\" WHETHER YOU'RE WALKING, STANDING, SITTING, OR LYING DOWN, YOU MUST NOT FORGET! YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEEK SPECIAL EXCELLENCE OR EXTRAORDINARY WONDERS BESIDES.\nMASTER SHUI LAO ASKED MA TSU, \"WHAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE COMING FROM THE WEST?\"\nMA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE GOT UP, CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY, AND SAID, \"HOW EXTRAORDINARY! HOW WONDERFUL! INSTANTLY, ON THE TIP OF A HAIR, I'VE UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF CONCENTRATION, AND COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS.\" THEN HE BOWED AND WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS, HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY, \"FROM THE TIME I TOOK MA TSU'S KICK, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVEN'T STOPPED LAUGHING.\"\nLast night it rained cats and dogs. I have always wondered where this phrase may have come from. There is only one possible source, and that is a fable of Aesop: A cat was very happily walking by, smiling to herself, and a dog asked her, \"What is the matter?\"\nShe said, \"Last night in my dreams it rained, and it rained rats!\"\nThe dog said, \"Listen, you stupid cat. You don't understand a thing about dream psychology. I was also here last night and I can testify that it rained -- but it rained cats, not rats.\"\nThat seems to be accurate enough. Dogs can dream of cats raining, but the saying is, \"It rained cats and dogs.\" Who would be dreaming about dogs ...? Except for this small anecdote in Aesop there is no reference in the whole literature of the world, but it seems in almost all\nthe languages somehow the saying has taken root. One thing is certain: whatever the roots -- or no roots -- the saying is very expressive.\nThe rain last night was an immense joy ... not only to the earth -- thirsty, waiting for it -- but to the trees and to you all. These small experiences can release in you the ultimate experience ... just the beauty of them, the splendor, unexpected, unpredictable. Suddenly you are surrounded with such tremendous peace, silence -- and not empty, but full of songs and dances, and the whole existence rejoicing.\nAs one goes deeper on the path, as one releases oneself from the prison of one's own mind, ordinary experiences start taking extraordinary colors. Just an ordinary flower looked at silently becomes a wondrous experience. What a marvel that a small flower can exist with beautiful colors, with a little fragrance of its own, an individuality of its own. The greatest philosopher cannot fathom the meaning of the smallest flower.\nBut the mystic is not a philosopher; he does not bother to fathom meanings, to measure meanings, to think about things. He simply rejoices in them. When it rains, he dances, he joins hands with the rain. When trees are rejoicing, becoming fresh, one starts feeling the same freshness. Only one thing is needed, and that is the offering of the sutra this morning ... release.\nTa Hui is intending to convey a simple thing to you: you are the prison, you are the prisoner, and you are the one who has imprisoned you. You are playing a game with yourself. One part of you functions as the jailer, another part functions as the jail, and your innermost core is crushed between these two parts. You become a prisoner; it is not that somebody else is making you a prisoner.\nIt would have been a great calamity if man's consciousness was imprisoned by somebody else. Then freedom would not be in your own hands; then freedom would be in somebody else's hands. It is marvelous that you are yourself imprisoning your being, hence the release can happen instantly. It is only a question of a little understanding, just a little intelligence.\nThis sutra is very beautiful. It says, \"IN OUR FAMILY ...\" To whom is Ta Hui referring as \"our family\"? You are included in it, as are all those who are involved in this great affair of searching, seeking, trying to penetrate into the mysteries of existence. They may have been past, they may be present, they may be in the future, but they constitute the only family worth calling family.\nThere is a physical, biological family: your parents, your brothers, your sisters, your husbands, your wives, your children -- but that is a very superficial phenomenon, accidental. There is a deeper family which has nothing to do with your biological origins but is concerned with your ultimate search. It is spiritual. It is not accidental -- it is very essential.\nOnce you become aware, you will be suddenly amazed that all the buddhas of the past and all the buddhas of the future and all the buddhas of the present constitute a single family, because their experience is the same, their truth is the same, their life is surrounded with the same fragrance. They in no way differ from each other. If you have come across a single buddha, you have come across all of them. He contains all of them; he represents all of them.\nTa Hui is immensely beautiful to mention it as a family ... IN OUR FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. Everybody in the family knows about it, but nobody says anything about it. Everybody in the family has experienced it, but\nremains absolutely silent about it, because knowing the ultimate is also to know simultaneously that it is inexpressible. Those who try to express it are those who don't know.\nThis is the marvel: Those who know don't try to express it, and those who don't know try to express it.\nThe ignorant are very articulate; they say things about God, about heaven and about hell, and the ones who know are utterly silent about the mysteries of life. You can know whether a man has experienced something or not by his being silent about the ultimate matters. He may indicate, he may give a few hints, he may create devices in which you can also awaken to the experience -- but he will not say a single word.\nBecause of this fact, Zen has strange ways of transmitting. The truth has always been transmitted; it has never been said. It is more like a gesture of the hand, more like a smile on the lips, more like a twinkle in the eyes ... but it is never a word.\nIN OUR FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. IT WOULD NOT HELP EVEN IF THE SKY BECAME MY MOUTH, AND GRASS, TREES, PEBBLES, AND STONES ALL EMITTED LIGHT TO HELP ME EXPOUND THE TRUTH. THUS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THING CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED AND CANNOT BE STUDIED: IT REQUIRES ONE'S OWN REALIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT.\nThis has to be understood as the very fundamental: if you are ready, open, receptive, alert, you will get it. And you will get it in strange ways which have no logical relationship, no causal relationship.\nMany intellectuals in the world who have become aware of Zen in the past century were, in the beginning, simply laughing at the craziness of these people, because it does not make sense to their reasoning minds. Somebody hits you and you become enlightened ... the mind cannot believe it. There seems to be no reason why a certain hit will destroy all your ignorance.\nEven today, Zen is being studied in the West on a vast scale; it has become one of the universal phenomena. But the very idea of studying it goes against it: you cannot study Zen. You can have it, but you cannot get it from someone else. And the simple reason is that you have already got it. It is just a question of forgetfulness.\nIt will be helpful for you to be reminded ... Perhaps in everybody's life there are moments when you know that a certain name, a certain person, a certain face is known to you. The expression exists in all the languages that it is \"just on the tip of my tongue.\" Then who is preventing you, why don't you tell it? You know perfectly well it is there, but it needs some release -- and perhaps a hit may do it. You have only forgotten -- perhaps a good hit will help you to forget to remember it, because the effort to remember a thing makes your mind tense, and the more you try to remember, the more tense you become.\nTension means narrowing of the mind. It becomes so narrow that nothing can pass through it. A good hit and the mind opens ... because you have forgotten that you were trying to remember something, and suddenly that which was on your tongue is no more a secret; now you know it fully well. Something like this has been happening in transmissions of a higher and deeper level.\nBut Zen is not a study. There is no way to make it a subject of studies in the universities; that will be very stupid. There is no way to find someone who has it who can give it to you. It\nis not that the people who have it are miserly or not generous -- just the contrary. They are the most generous people; if they could give it to you they would not bother whether you want it or not, they would give it to you.\nBut the very nature of the experience is such that it does not come from outside; it happens within you. The people who have experienced it are in constant search of creating a situation around you so that what is asleep becomes awake. Once you understand it, Zen will not look crazy, it will not look irrational. It will look certainly super-rational -- beyond the capacities of the mind.\nTHUS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THING CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED AND CANNOT BE STUDIED: IT REQUIRES ONE'S OWN REALIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT.\nIt has become more difficult because Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, Jews have created a very difficult situation for millions of people. They have been giving people the idea that it will be delivered to you by a savior, it will be given to you by a messenger; all you have to do is to believe and wait. Jesus will redeem you -- or Mohammed or Krishna.\nWhat I want to point out very clearly is that the idea that somebody else, it does not matter who -- Jesus, Moses, Krishna or Mohammed ... the idea that somebody else will do it on your behalf is absolutely wrong. But this idea has prevailed and it is very easy to accept it, it is very simple to be imprisoned by it, because somebody else is taking the responsibility.\nIn this world people are very easily ready to give responsibility to somebody else. They think that by giving away responsibility they are free of the burden. They are absolutely wrong. Responsibility is freedom, and the moment you give responsibility to somebody else you have also given your freedom.\nNow two thousand years have passed and Christians are waiting for the savior to come. I tell you he is never going to come, for the simple reason that what he has promised he cannot deliver. Krishna has promised that he will be coming, but it is strange that nobody wonders why these people did not redeem humanity while they were here. What is the point of postponing it for the future, for the next time when they will come?\nPeople were as much in misery then as they are now, people were as much ignorant as they are now -- so what was the reason to postpone? Jesus could have redeemed the whole world, Krishna could have enlightened everybody. But it was a very subtle game: they took the responsibility -- and helped you to remain a prisoner till they come back. Just go on praying ... one day he is going to come.\nThis has taken away not only your responsibility but your freedom. It has taken away your very individuality and your uniqueness.\nI love Gautam Buddha for the simple reason that he is the first man in the long history of man who refused to take the responsibility of redeeming anybody. He seems to be the most courageous man -- because it is so easy to gather followers if you take responsibility, and rather than taking responsibility he was saying that there is no way for anybody else to redeem you.\nLet it sink deep in your hearts. Only you are capable of awakening.\nBecause only you are capable of falling asleep.\nNobody else is responsible for your sleep.\nHow can somebody else be responsible for your awakening? All those who have promised to redeem you have humiliated you; they have reduced you to less than human beings.\nIt is not a coincidence that Jesus goes on calling himself the shepherd and you the sheep and I sometimes wonder why not even a single man stood up and said, \"This is very insulting.\" Not that people must not have felt it, but it was very cheap, and \"the fellow is taking all the responsibility, that is good -- so we need not bother about it. We can go round and round in our trivia and he will take care of our spirituality.\" It was a good chance to get rid of the whole affair.\nIt seems hurtful ... but I cannot say anything which is not true. All these people behaved more like businessmen; they were more concerned in having more and more customers.\nGautam Buddha seems to be the single man who is not interested in having followers, who is not interested in being a shepherd, who is not interested in reducing you into sheep. On the contrary, his whole life he insisted on only one thing: You are just like me; the difference is very small. One day I was asleep, today I am awake. Today you are asleep, tomorrow you may be awake -- and if you are intelligent you can be awake this very moment.\nBuddha alone gives respect to individuality, to human beings -- no one else has ever given it. He denied God for the simple reason that God cannot be accepted. The very acceptance of God as a creator destroys the whole beauty of humanity. Then you are just a puppet in the hands of a God who seems to be whimsical. For no reason he created you, and for no reason he can decreate you.\nBuddha removed God completely from the vision of the people who understood him: God and man cannot exist together. No coexistence is possible, because God is basically a dictatorial concept, absolute dictatorship ... and man cannot raise his head in freedom if there is a God. You can hear people say that without the will of God not even a leaf moves. Then this whole existence becomes an imprisonment, a great concentration camp, and God becomes Adolf Hitler a million times magnified.\nGautam Buddha, rather than talking about hypothetical nonsense, takes the existential problem directly: the problem is your release. And the problem is simple because the release is within your own hands: you have just forgotten who you are. Just by telling you who you are, you will not understand, and the danger is that by telling you who you are, you may become a parrot. You may start ...\nIn India you will find a whole country full of parrots. Everybody is talking about the soul, enlightenment, awakening, nirvana. They have all been repeating beautiful sentences from scriptures. Buddha also does not want to make you a parrot; hence he says there is no way to give you the truth, for the simple reason that you already have it.\nSo all that can be done is somehow to create situations to wake you up and, if it is needed, to give you a good slap at the right moment. Anybody's slap won't do, only a master's -- and only a disciple who has been working on the way for years, or maybe for lives, comes to a point just on the boundary line, where a little push ... and he has reached to the other shore. So there are disciplines in Buddhism, but those disciplines are not going to give you the truth. They are only going to bring you to the point where some insightful compassionate master will be needed to create a device which releases you.\nHave you seen small birds? They see their parents flying all around, and they also flutter their wings. But they are afraid -- naturally, because they have never flown -- and they cannot believe that going out of their cozy nest is safe. The vast sky ... and no experience of flying -- although they are capable of flying, they have the wings, and they will rejoice to fly in the sky under the warm sun.\nFinally the parents of those small birds have to push them. That is a device -- that is a Zen device. But the parents have to wait till their wings are strong enough; they do many things which to me seem to be exactly what the Zen master does for the disciple. The mother will fly in front of them, showing that if she can fly, why can't they? The young birds flutter their wings to gain confidence, to become acquainted with the fact that they also have wings -- it's true!\nBut to take the jump ... They come to the very edge of their nest, they weigh all the pros and cons. There is a great longing to take the jump, but there is also a fear because they are going into the unknown. Who knows -- they may fall flat on the earth and be finished. The mother goes to the other tree, and from there she starts calling them: Come on! It is irresistible. They try, but some invisible boundary prevents them.\nWhen the parents see that now they are perfectly capable, it is only fear that is preventing them, one day, without informing them, suddenly a Zen push ...! Of course in the beginning they flutter in a haphazard way, but they know now that although they are not flying as they should, they can keep themselves up in the air. Then the mother starts calling them from faraway trees. First they go to very close trees, then they start going to farther trees, and then one day they are gone forever into the infinite; they never come back. Then the whole sky has become theirs.\nI have always thought that the Zen devices of transmitting must have come from such sources. Zen monasteries are in the forests, and some genius master may have seen the situation of a bird being pushed. There is no logical sense. You cannot convince the bird intellectually, and a push is not a rational way.\nBE SURE TO REMEMBER THE WORDS OF A PREVIOUS DAY: \"IN PRINCIPLE, IT\nIS SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT.\" In principle only is it sudden enlightenment. In practice, in reality, the small bird has to grow strong wings, wait for the right moment, and has to be under the protection of a right master. Any hurry can be fatal.\nIf somebody is awakened before his ripening time, before his maturity, that enlightenment can be dangerous. He may not be able to survive it, it may be too much. He was not yet able to contain it, to absorb it, to relish it. So in principle Ta Hui is right; it is sudden enlightenment.\nIntellectuals all over the world have asked, \"If it is sudden, then why is it not happening to us? Then why does somebody have to meditate for years if it is sudden?\" They have not understood that in principle it is sudden. When it will happen, it will happen suddenly -- but before that happening, a certain maturity is needed. That means enlightenment in itself is sudden, but its preparation is gradual.\nTa Hui is bringing a tremendous synthesis to two conflicting schools. One says it is gradual, one says it is sudden -- and they have gone on fighting for centuries, arguing against each other. They cannot see that gradualness and suddenness are not necessarily opposite, that gradualness can be a preparation for suddenness. They cannot see that both can be part of a synthetic process.\n... TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO CLEAR EVERYTHING\nAWAY. IN THE EVENT -- but in the actual event -- PHENOMENA ARE NOT SUDDENLY REMOVED BUT EXHAUSTED GRADUALLY. It takes time, different times for different people. According to their love, according to their trust, according to their longing, according to their passion, according to their readiness to risk all, the time element will differ.\nMahakashyapa was the first to become enlightened amongst Gautam Buddha's disciples, and he was the most silent person. He never asked a question, never even came close to Gautam Buddha. He had his own tree, and he would sit under his own tree; it became known that that place was reserved for Mahakashyapa. He did not speak, he did not question ... he simply sat under the tree, not far away from Gautam Buddha.\nAmongst ten thousand disciples everybody was asking questions, and many were asking Mahakashyapa, \"Why don't you ask?\" He would simply smile ...\nOne day Gautam Buddha came with a lotus flower in his hand -- and that day was the beginning of Zen. Buddha was supposed to give a discourse as usual, but rather than giving a discourse he sat there in the utter silence of ten thousand disciples, just looking at the lotus flower. Moments passed ... people started becoming restless. What has happened? In the first place he had never come before with anything in his hand; in the second place, he seems to have completely forgotten for what he has come. Thirdly, it is strange that he goes on looking at that lotus flower. It is beautiful ... but that does not mean that you have to go on looking forever and forever.\nHours passed and people became really agitated. Something has to be done ... and at that very moment Mahakashyapa laughed. Gautam Buddha looked at Mahakashyapa, called him close and said, \"This flower belongs to you. Take care of it.\" This is the first transmission without words.\nPeople looked in amazement: \"What has happened?\" In the first place, to laugh in the presence of the master without any reason is not courteous, it is not respectful. Secondly, there was nothing to laugh at. Thirdly, what has been transmitted? All that people can see is a lotus flower.\nBut Mahakashyapa became the first Zen master. He is rarely mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures because he rarely spoke. And because he received the transmission without words, nobody knows what he has received. When finally forced by other disciples -- older, more prominent -- Mahakashyapa said, \"I have not received, I have only recognized. In that great silence when you were all becoming restless I started becoming restful. My silence became deeper, to a point that I suddenly saw that it is so ridiculous to search for truth because I am the truth. At that very moment I could not contain it, and I laughed. The flower was given to me as a confirmation that 'your laughter means you have opened your wings in the sky. You are released.'\"\nWhen one comes to a master, one has so much garbage which the master has to remove gradually, because to him it is garbage, but to the disciple it is knowledge. To the master it is chains; to the disciple, these are his ornaments. So it takes time ... the master goes on throwing the garbage out and the disciple goes on collecting it back, and hiding it in deeper places where the master cannot reach, until there is a recognition that the master and the disciple stand in the same space. Then anything will do, just a little push ...\nWHETHER YOU ARE WALKING, STANDING, SITTING, OR LYING DOWN, YOU\nMUST NOT FORGET! ... Must not forget what? Simply MUST NOT FORGET. Simply remain alert and aware, not of anything special, not of any object, but just alert, as if something great is going to happen, you don't know what; as if a great guest is going to come and you are standing at your door waiting. You don't know who is coming ... you don't know whether he is coming or not. You don't have any confirmation -- but greatly alert you are standing at the door, not knowing for what. A pure awareness ...\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO SEEK SPECIAL EXCELLENCE OR EXTRAORDINARY\nWONDERS BESIDES. On the path the greatest hindrance is that you can find special qualities, extraordinary powers, miracles, mysterious experiences, and you can get lost into all that. It was not your search; you got off the path. Remember not to seek special excellence or extraordinary wonders besides.\nMASTER SHUI LAO ASKED MA TSU, \"WHAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE\nCOMING FROM THE WEST?\" This is a special way of asking the question, \"What is the true meaning of Bodhidharma coming from the West?\" -- because to China, India is the West. \"What was the special reason for Bodhidharma coming to China?\" In other words the question is, \"What has he come to transmit?\" It took him three years to reach so far, and it took him nine years to transmit. What was it?\nMA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE GOT UP, CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY, AND SAID, \"HOW EXTRAORDINARY! HOW WONDERFUL! INSTANTLY, ON THE TIP OF A HAIR, I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF CONCENTRATION, AND COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS.\" THEN HE BOWED AND WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY, \"FROM THE TIME I TOOK MA TSU'S KICK, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NOT STOPPED LAUGHING.\"\nRemember that Master Shui Lao is not an ordinary disciple; he is already recognized as a great master, although he is only a great teacher. But the difference is very subtle and can be known only by those who are beyond the master and the teacher. He was known as a master himself ... and he was not just a teacher; he had come gradually closer and closer to being a master but he needed a last push. He was fluttering his wings ... he was waiting, but just on the verge of flying into the sky.\nMaster Shui Lao asked Ma Tsu ... Ma Tsu is one of the strangest masters in the assembly of strange masters of Zen. Shui Lao is asking a simple question: \"Why did Bodhidharma come to China? What special transmission was there that he had to deliver?\" MA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED.\nNow incidents like this make intellectuals confused. What has happened? Ma Tsu has shown him that Bodhidharma has come to kill your ego, to release you from the fear of death. He kicked him in the chest, knocked him down. It was so strange and so sudden, it was not expected. He had asked a simple routine question; any intellectual could have explained why Bodhidharma had come to China -- to spread Buddhism, to spread the message of the great master.\nBut nobody could have thought that Ma Tsu would do this to the poor questioner and it was so sudden and so unpredictable ... But it is only sudden and unpredictable to us; Ma Tsu\ncould have seen the ripeness of the man, the maturity ... that he needs just a small push, that this moment should not be missed. His kicking him on the chest and knocking him down may have completely stopped the functioning of his mind, because it was so unexpected and so strange. In that stopping of the mind is the release. Suddenly the goose is out! Shui Lao became enlightened.\nHE GOT UP, CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY, AND SAID, \"HOW EXTRAORDINARY! HOW WONDERFUL! INSTANTLY, ON THE TIP OF A HAIR, I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF CONCENTRATION, AND COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS.\" THEN HE BOWED -- in deep respect -- AND WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS, HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY\n-- he became himself a great master -- \"FROM THE TIME I TOOK MA TSU'S KICK, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NOT STOPPED LAUGHING. How can one stop laughing? This great affair is so ridiculous!\nIt is just like a dog who, on a winter morning in the warm sun, sitting silently looking at his tail, becomes interested in catching it. He tries in many ways, and the more he tries, the more he becomes challenged, because the tail jumps immediately. The faster he jumps, the faster the tail jumps -- and the difference remains the same. Standing by the side you will laugh: \"This stupid dog! That tail belongs to him; there is no need to catch hold of it -- and there is no way ...\"\nYour enlightenment belongs to you. There is no need to seek and search.\nYou are it. It is not an achievement, it is only a recognition -- hence the laughing.\nNaturally, people who have not been accustomed to the tradition of Zen will be shocked by such behavior. If I suddenly knock Maneesha here and now, although she is not yet ripe -- but if I knock, will you understand? You will think, \"This man has gone mad.\" You will think, \"We already knew that he was mad; now he has crossed all the boundaries.\" And from tomorrow, those who sit in front will remain alert: at any moment ...\nAnd this is going to happen, because I am not going to leave this world unless I make more people enlightened than Gautam Buddha. I am watching who is growing wings, who is becoming ready to be knocked -- so don't be surprised. And when somebody gets knocked, rejoice in the happening! The man has become enlightened.\nBut people who are not in a deep resonance with Zen will not be able to understand it -- Hindus or Mohammedans or Christians or Jews -- because there is nothing like that in their whole history. Their whole history is more or less just intellectual gymnastics.\nZen is absolutely existential. The master is there not only to teach you certain doctrines; he has to release you from the prison that you yourself have made. Whatever arbitrary, expedient methods are needed, he is not going to be worried about what people will think of them; he will use them.\nThere have never been more compassionate beings than Zen masters. It is a great compassion of Ma Tsu; otherwise, who cares? -- he could have just answered the question and the whole thing would be over. He took so much effort, hit the man, knocked him down ...\nAnd it is not only Ma Tsu who is compassionate: Shui Lao also knows tremendous understanding. If it had happened to somebody who was not ready, he would have started\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5783","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part33/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">31 Release</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5783 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part33.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

part of the great affair. On this pilgrimage from here to here, just be
thoroughgoing; half-heartedness will not do. And then even in a single
moment one can become enlightened -- because one is already
enlightened.</p><p>You just have to gather yourself. You have fallen apart: your hand is
lying here, your leg is lying there, somebody is playing football with
your head. You have just to put yourself together. And once you are
together, there is nothing more to achieve. But you yourself go on
splitting yourself, dividing yourself.</p><p>I have heard ... a thief was brought into the court. He was a famous
thief, and the magistrate said, "You are such an experienced man. What
was the reason that you entered into the house, remained there the whole
night, did not steal anything, and yet, got caught?"</p><p>He said, "It is a strange story. First I want to ask you one thing:
that if you want to send me to the gallows, you can; but don't give me
one sentence, and that is to have two wives."</p><p>The magistrate said, "But there is no punishment like having two
wives."</p><p>The thief said, "That's very good. That's what happened. I entered
into this house, and this man has two wives. One wife lives on the
ground floor and the other wife lives on the first floor. They both
dragged this man on the staircase, and the drama was so great that I
forgot completely for what I had come." It was so pitiable! Somehow one
woman would pull him upstairs, and as he was reaching, the other woman
would come and start dragging him downwards. This went on the whole
night, and I could not escape because I was inside the house and all the
three people were awake, and I could not steal anything because the
scene was so hilarious."</p><p>But if you look at yourself, do you know how many wives you have? how
many husbands you have? in how many places you have left your parts? how
many desires, how many ambitions? You have cut yourself into pieces. You
have behaved like a butcher with yourself.</p><p>All the teaching of the awakened people is simply one: Be integrated.
Come together. Find out all your parts and get crystallized. Become
one.</p><p>In this oneness is your realization, the end of the world of darkness
and the beginning of the world of light, truth, blissfulness ... and
much more that has no words to be expressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>31</p><p>Release</p><p>17 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, RELEASE</p><p>IN OUR FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. IT

FROM THE WEST?"</p><p>MA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS

HAIR, I'VE UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF CONCENTRATION,
AND COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS." THEN HE BOWED AND WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS,
HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY, "FROM THE TIME I TOOK MA TSU'S KICK, UP
UNTIL NOW, I HAVEN'T STOPPED LAUGHING."</p><p><br></p><p>Last night it rained cats and dogs. I have always wondered where this
phrase may have come from. There is only one possible source, and that
is a fable of Aesop: A cat was very happily walking by, smiling to
herself, and a dog asked her, "What is the matter?"</p><p>She said, "Last night in my dreams it rained, and it rained
rats!"</p><p>The dog said, "Listen, you stupid cat. You don't understand a thing
about dream psychology. I was also here last night and I can testify
that it rained -- but it rained cats, not rats."</p><p>That seems to be accurate enough. Dogs can dream of cats raining, but
the saying is, "It rained cats and dogs." Who would be dreaming about
dogs ...? Except for this small anecdote in Aesop there is no reference
in the whole literature of the world, but it seems in almost all</p><p>the languages somehow the saying has taken root. One thing is
certain: whatever the roots -- or no roots -- the saying is very
expressive.</p><p>The rain last night was an immense joy ... not only to the earth --
thirsty, waiting for it -- but to the trees and to you all. These small
experiences can release in you the ultimate experience ... just the
beauty of them, the splendor, unexpected, unpredictable. Suddenly you
are surrounded with such tremendous peace, silence -- and not empty, but
full of songs and dances, and the whole existence rejoicing.</p><p>As one goes deeper on the path, as one releases oneself from the
prison of one's own mind, ordinary experiences start taking
extraordinary colors. Just an ordinary flower looked at silently becomes
a wondrous experience. What a marvel that a small flower can exist with
beautiful colors, with a little fragrance of its own, an individuality
of its own. The greatest philosopher cannot fathom the meaning of the
smallest flower.</p><p>But the mystic is not a philosopher; he does not bother to fathom
meanings, to measure meanings, to think about things. He simply rejoices
in them. When it rains, he dances, he joins hands with the rain. When
trees are rejoicing, becoming fresh, one starts feeling the same
freshness. Only one thing is needed, and that is the offering of the
sutra this morning ... release.</p><p>Ta Hui is intending to convey a simple thing to you: you are the
prison, you are the prisoner, and you are the one who has imprisoned
you. You are playing a game with yourself. One part of you functions as
the jailer, another part functions as the jail, and your innermost core
is crushed between these two parts. You become a prisoner; it is not
that somebody else is making you a prisoner.</p><p>It would have been a great calamity if man's consciousness was
imprisoned by somebody else. Then freedom would not be in your own
hands; then freedom would be in somebody else's hands. It is marvelous
that you are yourself imprisoning your being, hence the release can
happen instantly. It is only a question of a little understanding, just
a little intelligence.</p><p>This sutra is very beautiful. It says, "IN OUR FAMILY ..." To whom is
Ta Hui referring as "our family"? You are included in it, as are all
those who are involved in this great affair of searching, seeking,
trying to penetrate into the mysteries of existence. They may have been
past, they may be present, they may be in the future, but they
constitute the only family worth calling family.</p><p>There is a physical, biological family: your parents, your brothers,
your sisters, your husbands, your wives, your children -- but that is a
very superficial phenomenon, accidental. There is a deeper family which
has nothing to do with your biological origins but is concerned with
your ultimate search. It is spiritual. It is not accidental -- it is
very essential.</p><p>Once you become aware, you will be suddenly amazed that all the
buddhas of the past and all the buddhas of the future and all the
buddhas of the present constitute a single family, because their
experience is the same, their truth is the same, their life is
surrounded with the same fragrance. They in no way differ from each
other. If you have come across a single buddha, you have come across all
of them. He contains all of them; he represents all of them.</p><p>Ta Hui is immensely beautiful to mention it as a family ... IN OUR
FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. Everybody in the
family knows about it, but nobody says anything about it. Everybody in
the family has experienced it, but</p><p>remains absolutely silent about it, because knowing the ultimate is
also to know simultaneously that it is inexpressible. Those who try to
express it are those who don't know.</p><p>This is the marvel: Those who know don't try to express it, and those
who don't know try to express it.</p><p>The ignorant are very articulate; they say things about God, about
heaven and about hell, and the ones who know are utterly silent about
the mysteries of life. You can know whether a man has experienced
something or not by his being silent about the ultimate matters. He may
indicate, he may give a few hints, he may create devices in which you
can also awaken to the experience -- but he will not say a single
word.</p><p>Because of this fact, Zen has strange ways of transmitting. The truth
has always been transmitted; it has never been said. It is more like a
gesture of the hand, more like a smile on the lips, more like a twinkle
in the eyes ... but it is never a word.</p><p>IN OUR FAMILY THERE IS INDEED A SUBTLE MARVEL NOT TRANSMITTED. IT
WOULD NOT HELP EVEN IF THE SKY BECAME MY MOUTH, AND GRASS, TREES,
PEBBLES, AND STONES ALL EMITTED LIGHT TO HELP ME EXPOUND THE TRUTH. THUS
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THING CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED AND CANNOT BE STUDIED:
IT REQUIRES ONE'S OWN REALIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p>This has to be understood as the very fundamental: if you are ready,
open, receptive, alert, you will get it. And you will get it in strange
ways which have no logical relationship, no causal relationship.</p><p>Many intellectuals in the world who have become aware of Zen in the
past century were, in the beginning, simply laughing at the craziness of
these people, because it does not make sense to their reasoning minds.
Somebody hits you and you become enlightened ... the mind cannot believe
it. There seems to be no reason why a certain hit will destroy all your
ignorance.</p><p>Even today, Zen is being studied in the West on a vast scale; it has
become one of the universal phenomena. But the very idea of studying it
goes against it: you cannot study Zen. You can have it, but you cannot
get it from someone else. And the simple reason is that you have already
got it. It is just a question of forgetfulness.</p><p>It will be helpful for you to be reminded ... Perhaps in everybody's
life there are moments when you know that a certain name, a certain
person, a certain face is known to you. The expression exists in all the
languages that it is "just on the tip of my tongue." Then who is
preventing you, why don't you tell it? You know perfectly well it is
there, but it needs some release -- and perhaps a hit may do it. You
have only forgotten -- perhaps a good hit will help you to forget to
remember it, because the effort to remember a thing makes your mind
tense, and the more you try to remember, the more tense you become.</p><p>Tension means narrowing of the mind. It becomes so narrow that
nothing can pass through it. A good hit and the mind opens ... because
you have forgotten that you were trying to remember something, and
suddenly that which was on your tongue is no more a secret; now you know
it fully well. Something like this has been happening in transmissions
of a higher and deeper level.</p><p>But Zen is not a study. There is no way to make it a subject of
studies in the universities; that will be very stupid. There is no way
to find someone who has it who can give it to you. It</p><p>is not that the people who have it are miserly or not generous --
just the contrary. They are the most generous people; if they could give
it to you they would not bother whether you want it or not, they would
give it to you.</p><p>But the very nature of the experience is such that it does not come
from outside; it happens within you. The people who have experienced it
are in constant search of creating a situation around you so that what
is asleep becomes awake. Once you understand it, Zen will not look
crazy, it will not look irrational. It will look certainly
super-rational -- beyond the capacities of the mind.</p><p>THUS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THING CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED AND CANNOT BE
STUDIED: IT REQUIRES ONE'S OWN REALIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p>It has become more difficult because Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians,
Jews have created a very difficult situation for millions of people.
They have been giving people the idea that it will be delivered to you
by a savior, it will be given to you by a messenger; all you have to do
is to believe and wait. Jesus will redeem you -- or Mohammed or
Krishna.</p><p>What I want to point out very clearly is that the idea that somebody
else, it does not matter who -- Jesus, Moses, Krishna or Mohammed ...
the idea that somebody else will do it on your behalf is absolutely
wrong. But this idea has prevailed and it is very easy to accept it, it
is very simple to be imprisoned by it, because somebody else is taking
the responsibility.</p><p>In this world people are very easily ready to give responsibility to
somebody else. They think that by giving away responsibility they are
free of the burden. They are absolutely wrong. Responsibility is
freedom, and the moment you give responsibility to somebody else you
have also given your freedom.</p><p>Now two thousand years have passed and Christians are waiting for the
savior to come. I tell you he is never going to come, for the simple
reason that what he has promised he cannot deliver. Krishna has promised
that he will be coming, but it is strange that nobody wonders why these
people did not redeem humanity while they were here. What is the point
of postponing it for the future, for the next time when they will
come?</p><p>People were as much in misery then as they are now, people were as
much ignorant as they are now -- so what was the reason to postpone?
Jesus could have redeemed the whole world, Krishna could have
enlightened everybody. But it was a very subtle game: they took the
responsibility -- and helped you to remain a prisoner till they come
back. Just go on praying ... one day he is going to come.</p><p>This has taken away not only your responsibility but your freedom. It
has taken away your very individuality and your uniqueness.</p><p>I love Gautam Buddha for the simple reason that he is the first man
in the long history of man who refused to take the responsibility of
redeeming anybody. He seems to be the most courageous man -- because it
is so easy to gather followers if you take responsibility, and rather
than taking responsibility he was saying that there is no way for
anybody else to redeem you.</p><p>Let it sink deep in your hearts. Only you are capable of
awakening.</p><p>Because only you are capable of falling asleep.</p><p>Nobody else is responsible for your sleep.</p><p>How can somebody else be responsible for your awakening? All those
who have promised to redeem you have humiliated you; they have reduced
you to less than human beings.</p><p>It is not a coincidence that Jesus goes on calling himself the
shepherd and you the sheep and I sometimes wonder why not even a single
man stood up and said, "This is very insulting." Not that people must
not have felt it, but it was very cheap, and "the fellow is taking all
the responsibility, that is good -- so we need not bother about it. We
can go round and round in our trivia and he will take care of our
spirituality." It was a good chance to get rid of the whole affair.</p><p>It seems hurtful ... but I cannot say anything which is not true. All
these people behaved more like businessmen; they were more concerned in
having more and more customers.</p><p>Gautam Buddha seems to be the single man who is not interested in
having followers, who is not interested in being a shepherd, who is not
interested in reducing you into sheep. On the contrary, his whole life
he insisted on only one thing: You are just like me; the difference is
very small. One day I was asleep, today I am awake. Today you are
asleep, tomorrow you may be awake -- and if you are intelligent you can
be awake this very moment.</p><p>Buddha alone gives respect to individuality, to human beings -- no
one else has ever given it. He denied God for the simple reason that God
cannot be accepted. The very acceptance of God as a creator destroys the
whole beauty of humanity. Then you are just a puppet in the hands of a
God who seems to be whimsical. For no reason he created you, and for no
reason he can decreate you.</p><p>Buddha removed God completely from the vision of the people who
understood him: God and man cannot exist together. No coexistence is
possible, because God is basically a dictatorial concept, absolute
dictatorship ... and man cannot raise his head in freedom if there is a
God. You can hear people say that without the will of God not even a
leaf moves. Then this whole existence becomes an imprisonment, a great
concentration camp, and God becomes Adolf Hitler a million times
magnified.</p><p>Gautam Buddha, rather than talking about hypothetical nonsense, takes
the existential problem directly: the problem is your release. And the
problem is simple because the release is within your own hands: you have
just forgotten who you are. Just by telling you who you are, you will
not understand, and the danger is that by telling you who you are, you
may become a parrot. You may start ...</p><p>In India you will find a whole country full of parrots. Everybody is
talking about the soul, enlightenment, awakening, nirvana. They have all
been repeating beautiful sentences from scriptures. Buddha also does not
want to make you a parrot; hence he says there is no way to give you the
truth, for the simple reason that you already have it.</p><p>So all that can be done is somehow to create situations to wake you
up and, if it is needed, to give you a good slap at the right moment.
Anybody's slap won't do, only a master's -- and only a disciple who has
been working on the way for years, or maybe for lives, comes to a point
just on the boundary line, where a little push ... and he has reached to
the other shore. So there are disciplines in Buddhism, but those
disciplines are not going to give you the truth. They are only going to
bring you to the point where some insightful compassionate master will
be needed to create a device which releases you.</p><p>Have you seen small birds? They see their parents flying all around,
and they also flutter their wings. But they are afraid -- naturally,
because they have never flown -- and they cannot believe that going out
of their cozy nest is safe. The vast sky ... and no experience of flying
-- although they are capable of flying, they have the wings, and they
will rejoice to fly in the sky under the warm sun.</p><p>Finally the parents of those small birds have to push them. That is a
device -- that is a Zen device. But the parents have to wait till their
wings are strong enough; they do many things which to me seem to be
exactly what the Zen master does for the disciple. The mother will fly
in front of them, showing that if she can fly, why can't they? The young
birds flutter their wings to gain confidence, to become acquainted with
the fact that they also have wings -- it's true!</p><p>But to take the jump ... They come to the very edge of their nest,
they weigh all the pros and cons. There is a great longing to take the
jump, but there is also a fear because they are going into the unknown.
Who knows -- they may fall flat on the earth and be finished. The mother
goes to the other tree, and from there she starts calling them: Come on!
It is irresistible. They try, but some invisible boundary prevents
them.</p><p>When the parents see that now they are perfectly capable, it is only
fear that is preventing them, one day, without informing them, suddenly
a Zen push ...! Of course in the beginning they flutter in a haphazard
way, but they know now that although they are not flying as they should,
they can keep themselves up in the air. Then the mother starts calling
them from faraway trees. First they go to very close trees, then they
start going to farther trees, and then one day they are gone forever
into the infinite; they never come back. Then the whole sky has become
theirs.</p><p>I have always thought that the Zen devices of transmitting must have
come from such sources. Zen monasteries are in the forests, and some
genius master may have seen the situation of a bird being pushed. There
is no logical sense. You cannot convince the bird intellectually, and a
push is not a rational way.</p><p>BE SURE TO REMEMBER THE WORDS OF A PREVIOUS DAY: "IN PRINCIPLE,
IT</p><p>IS SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT." In principle only is it sudden
enlightenment. In practice, in reality, the small bird has to grow
strong wings, wait for the right moment, and has to be under the
protection of a right master. Any hurry can be fatal.</p><p>If somebody is awakened before his ripening time, before his
maturity, that enlightenment can be dangerous. He may not be able to
survive it, it may be too much. He was not yet able to contain it, to
absorb it, to relish it. So in principle Ta Hui is right; it is sudden
enlightenment.</p><p>Intellectuals all over the world have asked, "If it is sudden, then
why is it not happening to us? Then why does somebody have to meditate
for years if it is sudden?" They have not understood that in principle
it is sudden. When it will happen, it will happen suddenly -- but before
that happening, a certain maturity is needed. That means enlightenment
in itself is sudden, but its preparation is gradual.</p><p>Ta Hui is bringing a tremendous synthesis to two conflicting schools.
One says it is gradual, one says it is sudden -- and they have gone on
fighting for centuries, arguing against each other. They cannot see that
gradualness and suddenness are not necessarily opposite, that
gradualness can be a preparation for suddenness. They cannot see that
both can be part of a synthetic process.</p><p>... TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO CLEAR EVERYTHING</p><p>AWAY. IN THE EVENT -- but in the actual event -- PHENOMENA ARE NOT
SUDDENLY REMOVED BUT EXHAUSTED GRADUALLY. It takes time, different times
for different people. According to their love, according to their trust,
according to their longing, according to their passion, according to
their readiness to risk all, the time element will differ.</p><p>Mahakashyapa was the first to become enlightened amongst Gautam
Buddha's disciples, and he was the most silent person. He never asked a
question, never even came close to Gautam Buddha. He had his own tree,
and he would sit under his own tree; it became known that that place was
reserved for Mahakashyapa. He did not speak, he did not question ... he
simply sat under the tree, not far away from Gautam Buddha.</p><p>Amongst ten thousand disciples everybody was asking questions, and
many were asking Mahakashyapa, "Why don't you ask?" He would simply
smile ...</p><p>One day Gautam Buddha came with a lotus flower in his hand -- and
that day was the beginning of Zen. Buddha was supposed to give a
discourse as usual, but rather than giving a discourse he sat there in
the utter silence of ten thousand disciples, just looking at the lotus
flower. Moments passed ... people started becoming restless. What has
happened? In the first place he had never come before with anything in
his hand; in the second place, he seems to have completely forgotten for
what he has come. Thirdly, it is strange that he goes on looking at that
lotus flower. It is beautiful ... but that does not mean that you have
to go on looking forever and forever.</p><p>Hours passed and people became really agitated. Something has to be
done ... and at that very moment Mahakashyapa laughed. Gautam Buddha
looked at Mahakashyapa, called him close and said, "This flower belongs
to you. Take care of it." This is the first transmission without
words.</p><p>People looked in amazement: "What has happened?" In the first place,
to laugh in the presence of the master without any reason is not
courteous, it is not respectful. Secondly, there was nothing to laugh
at. Thirdly, what has been transmitted? All that people can see is a
lotus flower.</p><p>But Mahakashyapa became the first Zen master. He is rarely mentioned
in the Buddhist scriptures because he rarely spoke. And because he
received the transmission without words, nobody knows what he has
received. When finally forced by other disciples -- older, more
prominent -- Mahakashyapa said, "I have not received, I have only
recognized. In that great silence when you were all becoming restless I
started becoming restful. My silence became deeper, to a point that I
suddenly saw that it is so ridiculous to search for truth because I am
the truth. At that very moment I could not contain it, and I laughed.
The flower was given to me as a confirmation that 'your laughter means
you have opened your wings in the sky. You are released.'"</p><p>When one comes to a master, one has so much garbage which the master
has to remove gradually, because to him it is garbage, but to the
disciple it is knowledge. To the master it is chains; to the disciple,
these are his ornaments. So it takes time ... the master goes on
throwing the garbage out and the disciple goes on collecting it back,
and hiding it in deeper places where the master cannot reach, until
there is a recognition that the master and the disciple stand in the
same space. Then anything will do, just a little push ...</p><p>WHETHER YOU ARE WALKING, STANDING, SITTING, OR LYING DOWN, YOU</p><p>MUST NOT FORGET! ... Must not forget what? Simply MUST NOT FORGET.
Simply remain alert and aware, not of anything special, not of any
object, but just alert, as if something great is going to happen, you
don't know what; as if a great guest is going to come and you are
standing at your door waiting. You don't know who is coming ... you
don't know whether he is coming or not. You don't have any confirmation
-- but greatly alert you are standing at the door, not knowing for what.
A pure awareness ...</p><p>YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEEK SPECIAL EXCELLENCE OR EXTRAORDINARY</p><p>WONDERS BESIDES. On the path the greatest hindrance is that you can
find special qualities, extraordinary powers, miracles, mysterious
experiences, and you can get lost into all that. It was not your search;
you got off the path. Remember not to seek special excellence or
extraordinary wonders besides.</p><p>MASTER SHUI LAO ASKED MA TSU, "WHAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE</p><p>COMING FROM THE WEST?" This is a special way of asking the question,
"What is the true meaning of Bodhidharma coming from the West?" --
because to China, India is the West. "What was the special reason for
Bodhidharma coming to China?" In other words the question is, "What has
he come to transmit?" It took him three years to reach so far, and it
took him nine years to transmit. What was it?</p><p>MA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS
GREATLY ENLIGHTENED. HE GOT UP, CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY,
AND SAID, "HOW EXTRAORDINARY! HOW WONDERFUL! INSTANTLY, ON THE TIP OF A
HAIR, I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF
CONCENTRATION, AND COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS." THEN HE BOWED AND
WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY, "FROM THE TIME I TOOK
MA TSU'S KICK, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NOT STOPPED LAUGHING."</p><p>Remember that Master Shui Lao is not an ordinary disciple; he is
already recognized as a great master, although he is only a great
teacher. But the difference is very subtle and can be known only by
those who are beyond the master and the teacher. He was known as a
master himself ... and he was not just a teacher; he had come gradually
closer and closer to being a master but he needed a last push. He was
fluttering his wings ... he was waiting, but just on the verge of flying
into the sky.</p><p>Master Shui Lao asked Ma Tsu ... Ma Tsu is one of the strangest
masters in the assembly of strange masters of Zen. Shui Lao is asking a
simple question: "Why did Bodhidharma come to China? What special
transmission was there that he had to deliver?" MA TSU THEN KNOCKED HIM
DOWN WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST: SHUI LAO WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED.</p><p>Now incidents like this make intellectuals confused. What has
happened? Ma Tsu has shown him that Bodhidharma has come to kill your
ego, to release you from the fear of death. He kicked him in the chest,
knocked him down. It was so strange and so sudden, it was not expected.
He had asked a simple routine question; any intellectual could have
explained why Bodhidharma had come to China -- to spread Buddhism, to
spread the message of the great master.</p><p>But nobody could have thought that Ma Tsu would do this to the poor
questioner and it was so sudden and so unpredictable ... But it is only
sudden and unpredictable to us; Ma Tsu</p><p>could have seen the ripeness of the man, the maturity ... that he
needs just a small push, that this moment should not be missed. His
kicking him on the chest and knocking him down may have completely
stopped the functioning of his mind, because it was so unexpected and so
strange. In that stopping of the mind is the release. Suddenly the goose
is out! Shui Lao became enlightened.</p><p>HE GOT UP, CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY, AND SAID, "HOW
EXTRAORDINARY! HOW WONDERFUL! INSTANTLY, ON THE TIP OF A HAIR, I HAVE
UNDERSTOOD THE ROOT SOURCE OF MYRIAD STATES OF CONCENTRATION, AND
COUNTLESS SUBTLE MEANINGS." THEN HE BOWED -- in deep respect -- AND
WITHDREW. AFTERWARDS, HE WOULD TELL THE ASSEMBLY</p><p>-- he became himself a great master -- "FROM THE TIME I TOOK MA TSU'S
KICK, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NOT STOPPED LAUGHING. How can one stop
laughing? This great affair is so ridiculous!</p><p>It is just like a dog who, on a winter morning in the warm sun,
sitting silently looking at his tail, becomes interested in catching it.
He tries in many ways, and the more he tries, the more he becomes
challenged, because the tail jumps immediately. The faster he jumps, the
faster the tail jumps -- and the difference remains the same. Standing
by the side you will laugh: "This stupid dog! That tail belongs to him;
there is no need to catch hold of it -- and there is no way ..."</p><p>Your enlightenment belongs to you. There is no need to seek and
search.</p><p>You are it. It is not an achievement, it is only a recognition --
hence the laughing.</p><p>Naturally, people who have not been accustomed to the tradition of
Zen will be shocked by such behavior. If I suddenly knock Maneesha here
and now, although she is not yet ripe -- but if I knock, will you
understand? You will think, "This man has gone mad." You will think, "We
already knew that he was mad; now he has crossed all the boundaries."
And from tomorrow, those who sit in front will remain alert: at any
moment ...</p><p>And this is going to happen, because I am not going to leave this
world unless I make more people enlightened than Gautam Buddha. I am
watching who is growing wings, who is becoming ready to be knocked -- so
don't be surprised. And when somebody gets knocked, rejoice in the
happening! The man has become enlightened.</p><p>But people who are not in a deep resonance with Zen will not be able
to understand it -- Hindus or Mohammedans or Christians or Jews --
because there is nothing like that in their whole history. Their whole
history is more or less just intellectual gymnastics.</p><p>Zen is absolutely existential. The master is there not only to teach
you certain doctrines; he has to release you from the prison that you
yourself have made. Whatever arbitrary, expedient methods are needed, he
is not going to be worried about what people will think of them; he will
use them.</p><p>There have never been more compassionate beings than Zen masters. It
is a great compassion of Ma Tsu; otherwise, who cares? -- he could have
just answered the question and the whole thing would be over. He took so
much effort, hit the man, knocked him down ...</p><p>And it is not only Ma Tsu who is compassionate: Shui Lao also knows
tremendous understanding. If it had happened to somebody who was not
ready, he would have started</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

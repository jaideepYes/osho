There is nothing to attain, there is no goal to reach. You are simply to relax, be at ease, and you will find that you have always been there, where you wanted to be. You have never left the Garden of Eden. The Christian story is wrong.\nI have been talking about the Christian story from so many different angles ... it is a beautiful story and certainly has tremendous potential. This aspect has also to be remembered, that wherever you are, you are still in the Garden of Eden. It is not even in the capacity of God to throw you out -- where will he throw you? -- because everywhere is the Garden of Eden. I am always wondering why not a single Christian theologian has raised the question in two thousand years: God drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, but where did he drive them to? Is there something outside of existence?\nEverything is within, there is nothing without. There are no boundaries to reality -- you cannot be thrown out of reality. It is such a simple fact: you are still in the Garden of Eden, you have just fallen asleep.\nYour sleep consists of your mind, of your desires, your dreams, your ambitions, your motivations. Once you drop all this crap, suddenly you wake up and you will find yourself in the Garden of Eden. And the Garden of Eden does not belong to God, it is not his monopoly. It belongs to everyone, to every living entity, because God is only a collective name for all the consciousnesses that exist in the world; God is not some person.\nThe Christian story has made God very ugly. If I have to write the story again, the first instructions I will give to Adam and Eve -- and those are the instructions I am giving to you -- will be: Eat the fruit of wisdom, eat the fruit of eternal life. You belong to the ultimate consciousness, you belong to deathlessness.\nYou are a buddha.\nYou just have to be shaken up.\nIt is not that you have to do many austerities and knock on the doors and beg and pray: \"God, Father, please open the door. I will never eat the fruit, I will never look at it.\" You are sitting under the tree. Just open your eyes, and wisdom is yours, and eternal life is yours. And these are not two trees ...\nThe story is wrong on many points. First, a God who is a father cannot prevent you from eternal life, and cannot prevent you from being wise. Secondly, wisdom and eternal life are not two; they are two aspects of the same experience.\nI declare to you; this is the Garden of Eden.\nIf you want to sleep a little more, there is no harm. There is no need to be in a hurry either. Sleep well; just stop dreaming ... and you will wake up. It is the dreams which go on keeping you asleep.\nIn other words, I can define meditation as a non-dreaming consciousness. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n33\nSerenity\n18 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, SILENT ILLUMINATION\nOLD P'ANG SAID, \"JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE REAL ALL THAT DOESN'T EXIST.\" JUST MASTER THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS, AND YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S TASK OF STUDY IS COMPLETED.\nTHESE DAYS THERE'S A BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS WHOSE OWN EYES ARE NOT CLEAR, WHO JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO STOP AND REST AND PLAY DEAD. EVEN IF YOU STOP AND REST LIKE THIS UNTIL A THOUSAND BUDDHAS APPEAR IN THE WORLD, YOU STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP AND REST -- YOU'LL BE MAKING YOUR MIND EVEN MORE CONFUSED AND TROUBLED. THEY TEACH PEOPLE TO \"KEEP THE MIND STILL,\" TO \"FORGET FEELINGS\" ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES, TO PRACTICE \"SILENT ILLUMINATION.\" AS THEY GO ON AND ON \"ILLUMINATING\" AND \"KEEPING THE MIND STILL,\" THEY ADD TO THEIR CONFUSION AND OPPRESSION, WITH NO END TO IT. UTTERLY LOSING THE EXPEDIENT MEANS OF THE PATRIARCHS, THEY INSTRUCT OTHERS WRONGLY, TEACHING PEOPLE TO GO ON IN VAIN AND WASTEFULLY WITH BIRTH AND DEATH; FURTHERMORE, THEY TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS. \"SIMPLY GO ON PUTTING THINGS TO REST THIS WAY,\" THEY'LL SAY. \"WHEN YOU'VE STOPPED FEELINGS AS THEY COME AND THOUGHTS ARE NOT PRODUCED, AT SUCH A TIME IT'S NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE -- IN FACT, IT'S ALERT AND AWAKE AND PERFECTLY CLEAR.\" THIS KIND IS EVEN MORE PERNICIOUS, BLINDING PEOPLES' EYES.\nTO SAY THAT WHEN ONE HAS PUT THINGS TO REST TO THE POINT THAT HE IS UNAWARES AND UNKNOWING, LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE, THIS IS NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE -- THIS IS A VIEW BORN OF WRONGLY TAKING TOO LITERALLY WORDS THAT WERE ONLY EXPEDIENT MEANS TO FREE BONDS. TO TEACH PEOPLE TO REFLECT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE CARE NOT TO LET ANY BAD PERCEPTIONS APPEAR -- THIS AGAIN IS AN INTERPRETATION PRODUCED BY ACCEPTING THE SKULL'S EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.\nALL THE ABOVE DISEASES ARE NOT THE STUDENTS' DOINGS -- THEY'RE ALL DUE TO THE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS OF BLIND TEACHERS.\nMan has been miserable -- not without reason. The reasons are of his own making; hence release is possible. But very few people have experienced absolute freedom.\nThere are a thousand and one causes for this calamity which has happened to humanity. It is just like a vast garden of thousands of rosebushes, where only once in a while a flower blossoms on a rosebush, and the remaining thousands of bushes simply remain barren. They have the same potential, but something has gone wrong in their structuring.\nTa Hui is trying here to show a few fundamental errors that have been made by man -- and he continues to make them -- which hinder his own growth.\nMost of the causes that have destroyed your dignity, your pride, your glory, your splendor are the doings of so-called teachers. There is a subtle egoistic joy in teaching because the moment you teach someone, without saying anything, you have become higher: you know and the other does not know. This has created great trouble for human beings.\nSo many false teachers go on appearing ... perhaps it is the greatest crime in the world to teach things which you have not experienced. But what are your bishops and cardinals and popes, imams and shankaracharyas? -- just a long line of false teachers. They don't know what they are saying. They may be quoting the right scriptures, their words may be coming from right sources, but it is not the sources and not the scriptures -- it is the man who speaks that is the ultimate criterion of whether what he says is true or not.\nOne great master, Naropa, has repeatedly said one thing: \"Don't listen to what I say, listen to me! It does not matter what I say; what matters is what I am.\"\nA true teacher speaks out of spontaneity, experience, awareness, his own realization. The false teacher is very learned; he knows all the scriptures, he quotes them beautifully and he can easily deceive people. In fact it is very difficult not to be deceived by such a person, because you don't know how to judge. He is speaking the right words, but his right words are just like a gramophone record. You cannot make a gramophone record your master; what it is saying is absolutely true, but there is no one inside. It is just a dead record.\nYour memory is also a dead record. Teachers teach through memory, masters teach through awareness, intelligence; hence it is possible to find inconsistencies and contradictions in masters -- in fact, they are bound to be found. This can be used as a criterion: if somebody is continuously consistent, he cannot be a master. He is only repeating things mechanically.\nThe master has to respond each moment, and each moment is different. The master never answers the question; he always answers the questioner -- and the questioners are different. The master is not concerned whether what he says is in tune with the scriptures, tradition, convention, or is against. His whole and sole concern is the real person whom he is encountering ... nothing else matters.\nBut the false teachers have not stopped, and will never stop. It is so easy to be learned; it is so difficult to be wise. Any idiot can be learned; all that he needs is a good memory system, a good biocomputer. But to be an authentic master is a rare flowering, and one has to understand some indications through which he can make a judgment in order to avoid the false and to listen to the authentic.\nThe first thing is: the false teacher is always repeating somebody else's words; he has none of his own. All his statements are within quotation marks. The second thing: the false teacher, howsoever articulate, learned, clever, will not be able to practice what he preaches. Look at the man rather than looking at his words, and you will see the disparity.\nIn one small village there were two brothers, twin brothers. One was a doctor and the other was a priest, and the whole village always had difficulty in recognizing which was which. A\nstranger had come to the town. He saw both of them and he could not believe his eyes. They were not exactly alike, but they used to have the same clothes, the same hairstyle, and it was almost impossible to make a distinction. He approached one of them and said, \"Is there a way to distinguish between you two? Only you can say ...\"\nThis brother was the doctor, and he said, \"Yes, there is only one way: he preaches and I practice!\"\nThe false teacher only preaches. If you look at his practice you will be very much disappointed; he goes against his own statements continuously.\nThirdly -- and this needs a little more intelligence and awareness to see -- the false teacher is always hesitant. He himself is not certain whether what he is saying is true or not because it is all borrowed. But the true teacher is an absolute authority. What he says he means, and he says only that which he means.\nThe teacher is only paying lip service to all the good things that you have been told. You will not find any original freshness; he stinks of dead corpses, very ancient corpses. The authentic master has a freshness, a newness. You may go on hearing him for ages, but you will never feel that he is stale because it is always coming from the original source.\nConsider the things that Ta Hui wants to point out to you: OLD P'ANG SAID, \"JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE REAL ALL THAT DOES NOT EXIST.\" JUST MASTER THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS, AND YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S TASK OF STUDY IS COMPLETED.\nWith the masters you will always find something strange, because you are unfamiliar with their world; it is untrodden. With the teachers you will find very familiar things which you already know -- you have heard them. In every church the same sermon, in every temple the same discourse; the whole atmosphere is filled with old and rotten statements.\nWith the real master you will always find something strange, some wildflower which does not grow in ordinary day to day gardens. Its taste, its fragrance, its color, its form -- everything will have a newness.\nNow what master P'ang says is absolutely unique. Nobody has ever said that: \"JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS. He is making two statements. And in those two statements, Ta Hui says, your whole religion is complete: \"RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE REAL ALL THAT DOES NOT EXIST.\"\nBut people are doing just the opposite: they go on creating the unreal -- that which does not exist. What do you know about God? Yet millions of people every day are praying to a fiction. It is pathology. What do you know about heaven and hell? But they have entered deep into your psychology: you are greedy for heaven, afraid of hell -- and these are all nonexistent things.\nP'ang is saying, \"Don't create that which does not exist; and that which exists, empty your mind of all attachment to it, of all infatuation with it.\" Your infatuation is your bondage; if you are not infatuated with that which exists, and you are not imaginative in creating gods and ghosts, what is left?\nA simple silence ... A pure serenity ...\nAn undisturbed, unruffled consciousness.\nAnd that is it!\nHence old P'ang is right. Within two simple sentences he has condensed all the teachings of all the awakened people. There are thousands of scriptures, but these two statements are enough; anything else is just unnecessary fabrication by the deluded people for the deluded people.\nPeople can get concerned with such stupid things -- you cannot believe it.\nChristian theologians of the middle ages had argued for centuries in great treatises. You will not believe what kind of idiots these theologians were. Their problem was how many angels can stand on the head of a pin. Why were they concerned? -- but it became such a big problem as if their life depended on whether one angel more or less can stand there. Those angels are fictitious -- and why should even those fictitious angels stand on the head of a pin?\nBut it was a very serious matter, and for three or four centuries it was debated almost continuously by great theologians, philosophers. If you look into the history of religions you will find such stupidities that you cannot believe that this is our heritage, that these are the old sources of our so-called great religions.\nFor two thousand years Christians had been arguing and insisting that Jesus was born of a virgin -- Mary. Now what does it matter? Even if he was born of Virgin Mary, he can be wrong. Just by being born of a virgin, you don't become right; in fact, more is the possibility that from the very beginning you are wrong. But even today the pope insists that this is their fundamental principle. What will Christianity be if three fictions are removed? One is the virgin birth of Jesus, which can be cancelled without any trouble.\nOne young girl was brought to a doctor by her mother, who was an old friend. She was very much worried because it was so apparent that the girl was at least seven or eight months pregnant -- there was no need for any test. Still the doctor took the test and he said, \"I am sorry, but nothing can be done. It is too late now; abortion is dangerous. The girl is pregnant.\"\nBut the mother said, \"How it can be? Because I never allow her any chances ...\"\nAnd the girl said, \"I have not even touched the hand of any man. How I can be pregnant?\"\nThe doctor looked at both of them and went to the window and looked at the sky. For a moment there was silence. Then the mother said, \"What are you doing there?\"\nHe said, \"I am waiting for the three wise men from the East. If it is true that she has not even touched the hand of a man, and you insist ... then the miracle has happened again: she is a virgin mother. You should rejoice. Why you are looking so miserable?\"\nJust a few days ago the pope has again insisted ... A few Christian thinkers are feeling awkward about this virgin birth, but he has insisted that it is \"one of our greatest pillars\".\nThe second pillar is that Jesus is the only begotten son of God. Nobody knows about this fellow God -- and except for Jesus' own statement, there is no other evidence or any proof. But the whole of Christianity depends on the statement of Jesus. No contemporary thinker, no contemporary literature even bothers to mention that Jesus is the son of God -- and not only the son, but the only begotten son. It is great: fictions are creating sons and daughters! And we have no evidence of their own existence ...\nAnd what is so great in Jesus that he should be the only begotten son of God? Why not Gautam Buddha, why not Bodhidharma, why not Mahakashyapa, why not Ta Hui -- why not\nyou? You just need a little courage and a little craziness and you can declare: \"I am the only begotten son of God.\" No proofs are needed, because even Jesus has not given any proofs.\nAnd the third: the trinity of God the father, Jesus the son, and the holy ghost. This holy ghost is the strangest guy you can come across. This holy ghost is the person who made the poor virgin Mary pregnant -- and still he is holy. Then what is the meaning of unholy?\nAnd it is strange ... for centuries Christians themselves have insisted that it looks strange, this trinity, because there is no woman in it. It looks incomplete; it does not look like a complete family. What is wrong in accepting Mary, who is worshipped by Catholics as part of this hierarchy? But the woman, just because she is the woman, cannot be accepted on that high pedestal. The criminal ghost can be accepted.\nJust the other day an Italian sannyasin has told me that he wants to put on record -- he is collecting my statements -- what I think about illegitimate children. I said to him, \"There are no illegitimate children, there are only illegitimate parents.\" How can a child be illegitimate? And who are the illegitimate parents? -- not necessarily those who are not married. Any child who is not born of love makes the parents illegitimate. Whether they are married or not is irrelevant -- but the child certainly is never illegitimate.\nThis illegitimate person, the holy ghost, is part of God's trinity; he is part of God. These are three phases of God -- but the woman cannot be accepted.\nThese are the three fundamentals, the three pillars of Christianity. If you remove these three, the whole edifice of two thousand years disappears like a soap bubble. But what is so great in all these ideas? Those who have been teaching these ideas can only be called false teachers, misguiding humanity. You cannot question them; your question will bring you condemnation. And this is not only so about Christianity; this is so about all the religions. Religion should be very simple, a pure and innocent affair. It should not be made complicated by unnecessary superstitions, stupidities.\nOld P'ang has given you the whole of religion in two small statements: \"Empty yourself of all attachment, of all infatuation, of all ambition for that which exists.\" And \"Don't create fictions.\" Nothing more is needed.\nThis is an authentic master, bringing the essential, pure serenity of your being in tune with the blissfulness of existence.\nYou are one with this silence ... and how marvelous it is ... and how wonderful. Can you think that something more is needed to rejoice and dance and sing?\nReligion, to be authentic, has to be concerned with man's transformation, not with these stupid ideas; whether they are real or unreal does not matter.\nTHESE DAYS ... and unfortunately, although one thousand years have passed since Ta Hui, \"these days\" still continue. THESE DAYS THERE'S A BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS ...\nI want to emphasize the word outsiders. Humanity can be divided in that way very easily -- the insiders and the outsiders. The insiders are very few -- those who know the inside story, the inside mystery. And the outsiders are the millions who are just standing outside of themselves, never trying to figure out what it is that makes them tick, what it is that is their life, what it is that is their consciousness, what it is that is their love ... simple matters.\nThe outsiders are concerned with faraway stars, quasars, remote galaxies ... so remote that there is no possibility that the earth will ever come in contact with them, because the universe has been found to be expanding. It is just like a balloon which goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and all the stars that you see are moving away from some center, which science has not yet been able to locate. But there is some center from which all these stars are moving at tremendous speed.\nNow the old fools were concerned with God, the holy ghost, the virgin birth, and the new fools are concerned with the galaxies, millions of light-years away. They have changed their objects but they have not changed their vision: they are still looking outwards. The outsider is one who is always looking outside. He is never at home.\nReligion is basically the experience of the insider. He closes his eyes and enters into the depths of his being, into the silences of his heart, and finally into the mysterious source of life, of all life, of all consciousness.\nThis is the only contentment, the only fulfillment, the only realization. For the first time there are no longer any problems, no longer any questions. You don't know anything, but your capacity of knowing is absolutely clear. You are just a pure mirror without any dust.\nTHESE DAYS THERE IS A BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS WHOSE OWN EYES ARE NOT CLEAR, WHO JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO STOP AND REST\nAND PLAY DEAD. Most of the religions have been teaching you to renounce the world, which cuts off most of your life. To renounce all pleasures cuts off your remaining life. \"Become more and more dead, and you will come closer and closer to God.\" This is a very strange god ...\nGod can be synonymous with life, then it has some meaning. But God synonymous with death ...? But this is what your saints have done: they have become fossils. Although they breathe, they have died to life in all its concerns. They have withdrawn all their sensitivity, their love, their joy; they have become shrunken.\nSo Ta Hui is right: EVEN IF YOU STOP AND REST LIKE THIS UNTIL A THOUSAND BUDDHAS APPEAR IN THE WORLD, YOU STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP AND REST -- YOU WILL BE MAKING YOUR MIND EVEN MORE CONFUSED\nAND TROUBLED. This overwhelming, poisonous idea of renouncing the world, of renouncing pleasures, of renouncing the body, of renouncing all that can make your life a little juicy, a little musical, a little poetic, and just being like a stone ... still your mind inside will be in turmoil.\nThere is a beautiful story from Mulla Nasruddin's life. He had been cutting wood and his donkey was standing by the side; he would load the wood on the donkey and take it home. But he was feeling very tired, and it was a hot afternoon and the shadow of the tree was alluring, so he allowed himself a little relaxation.\nJust then a group of wolves came around. Seeing the wolves, Mulla thought it is better to pretend to be dead, because it is known that wolves don't eat dead corpses. They want fresh food; they are not interested in canned food! So he stopped his breathing, but from the corner of his eye he was looking about for the donkey, because that was the problem: he himself is pretending to be dead, but the donkey is a fool ... and those wolves started eating his donkey.\nNow he is seeing it and there is a great turmoil inside -- but he is pretending to be dead. Finally he forgot and said, \"Okay, you can kill my donkey because I am dead. If I had been\nalive I would have shown you what it means to attack my donkey!\" This was going on inside his mind, and it came out of his mouth! It was just a coincidence that a few people arrived and he was saved.\nBut I want to tell you this story because he was pretending to be dead, although he was not. All your saints are pretending to be dead; they are not dead. How can they be? But all the religions have respected these dead people. And because of this respect for dead people, as a counterpart, there is a condemnation for living people. To be alive, fully alive, singing and dancing, rejoicing in the pleasures of existence, has become a sin according to all religions. Condensed to the essentials: life is sin and death is virtue.\nMy own experience is just the opposite, the opposite of all these religions. Life is virtue, and the more alive you are, the more virtuous; the more sensitive you are, the more religious; the more dimensions your life has, the more spiritual. Leave that old style of saintliness to the idiots because they cannot do anything else; but they can do that saintliness perfectly. My own understanding is that all your great saints are perfect idiots. They have not understood even the ABC of the mysteries of life, and they have fallen into the trap of false teachers.\nTHEY TEACH PEOPLE TO \"KEEP THE MIND STILL,\" TO \"FORGET FEELINGS\" ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES, TO PRACTICE \"SILENT ILLUMINATION.\" They\nuse beautiful words because all those words are available in thousands of scriptures, but they don't know that one cannot keep the mind still. Either you have the mind or you don't have it. A still mind is a contradiction in terms.\nOne famous American rabbi, Joshua Liebman -- I don't know whether he is still alive or not -- has written a book, PEACE OF MIND. I was a student in the university when I came across the book. I wrote to him in a letter: \"Even the title of your book is a contradiction in terms. 'Peace of mind' is simply absurd. When mind is not, there is peace; when mind is, there is no peace. Hence, 'peace of mind' is simply befooling people. But perhaps you yourself think ...\"\nHis book has been sold in millions because everybody wants peace of mind -- and so cheap, in a paperback edition! But I have never come across any man who has attained peace of mind by reading Rabbi Joshua Liebman's book. I was in the habit of writing letters to people, but it is an unfortunate situation that none of them had the courage to answer. Perhaps they could see the point, and it was better to remain silent.\nThese people who are telling others, \"Keep the mind still\" ... who is going to keep the mind still? You cannot force the mind to stillness. Mind has to be transcended, and in the transcendence of mind, in the realization that you are not the mind, suddenly the stillness, the peace, the calm, the quietude.\nAS THEY GO ON AND ON \"ILLUMINATING\" AND \"KEEPING THE MIND STILL,\" THEY ADD TO THEIR CONFUSION AND OPPRESSION, WITH NO END TO IT. UTTERLY LOSING THE EXPEDIENT MEANS OF THE PATRIARCHS, THEY INSTRUCT OTHERS WRONGLY, TEACHING PEOPLE TO GO ON IN VAIN AND WASTEFULLY WITH BIRTH AND DEATH; FURTHERMORE, THEY TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS. \"SIMPLY GO ON PUTTING THINGS TO REST THIS WAY,\" THEY WILL SAY. \"WHEN YOU HAVE STOPPED FEELINGS AS THEY COME AND THOUGHTS ARE NOT PRODUCED, AT SUCH A TIME IT IS NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE -- IN FACT, IT IS ALERT AND AWAKE AND PERFECTLY CLEAR.\"\nThese are deeper realities of life. You can attain a certain state of controlled silence, forced silence, but it will be dead. It will be like a bird on the wing that looks so beautiful. You catch hold of it and you put it in a golden cage; you may think it is the same bird -- it is not. Apparently it is, but the bird on the wing and the bird -- the same bird -- inside the cage are two different beings.\nThe bird on the wing has the whole sky ... he has a soul, he has an individuality, he has a beauty. The same bird inside the cage is just dead. It has lost its sky, it has lost its freedom, it has lost its individuality -- and what has it gained? To the bird the golden cage does not mean anything; gold or steel are just the same.\nIn the name of religion people have been trying to force themselves into a cage of discipline, precepts, hoping that they will attain to great illumination, alertness, awareness, enlightenment. It is not possible. If you want to be aware you have to start with awareness. If you want to be free you have to start with freedom. Whatever you want to be, your first step is the indication of your last.\nFinding realization ... You cannot do it by making yourself a slave of doctrines, precepts, moralities and hope that these will bring awareness, the ultimate flowering of your being.\nIt is true that if the ultimate flowering of awareness happens you will have a morality, but that morality will have a totally different nuance to it. It will be your own, not Moses', not Manu's, not Confucius'. It will not be a bondage, it will not be a burden, it will not be a commandment that you have to do. You will simply rejoice in doing it. It will not be a duty. It will be simply your joy.\nI have heard that when God created the world he went to the Babylonians and said, \"Would you like to have a commandment?\"\nThey said, \"What is the commandment?\" He said, \"Thou shall not commit adultery.\"\nThey said, \"Forgive us, without adultery what is the point of living. You just find somebody else ...!\"\nHe went to the Egyptians, he went all around, and nobody was ready to accept a commandment -- and I think they were all right. Commandments cannot be from somebody else, otherwise they make you a slave. They should arise from your own understanding; then they are not commandments, they are sheer joy.\nBut poor Moses got into trouble. Being a Jew, he asked the wrong question. When God asked, \"Moses, baby, would you like to have a commandment?\", Moses asked, \"How much does it cost?\" He did not ask what the commandment is! -- he asked the price!\nGod said, \"It is free!\"\nMoses said, \"Then I will have ten!\" If it is free ... And under those ten commandments, for four thousand years the Jews have been crushed.\nYou certainly need a morality but it has to arise out of your own love, out of your own reverence for life. It has to be your own; it needs your signature. It cannot be a blind belief, it cannot be a duty that you have been conditioned to fulfill. It has to be your freedom. An authentically religious man is amoral; he has no morality, ready-made. Each moment he responds with love and reverence and that is his morality.\nTHIS KIND IS EVEN MORE PERNICIOUS, BLINDING PEOPLES' EYES. When\nteachers start talking about illumination, enlightenment, stilling the mind, they use beautiful words to create a prison cell for you. What you need is freedom from all prisons.\nThe past has been continuously creating prisons upon prisons. You need a release, and only you can give this gift to yourself. I can only make you aware that you have the capacity -- that's the function of the master. He can only make you aware of your potential, of your possibilities, and then he leaves you to your own decision.\nTO SAY THAT WHEN ONE HAS PUT THINGS TO REST TO THE POINT THAT HE IS UNAWARES AND UNKNOWING, LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE, THIS IS NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE -- THIS IS A VIEW BORN OF WRONGLY TAKING TOO LITERALLY WORDS THAT WERE ONLY EXPEDIENT MEANS TO FREE BONDS.\nThe false teachers are collecting words, beautiful words. They are good collectors but they don't know the context, because the context is not present in the scriptures. The context is always present in a living master.\nTO TEACH PEOPLE TO REFLECT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE CARE NOT TO LET ANY BAD PERCEPTIONS APPEAR -- THIS AGAIN IS AN INTERPRETATION PRODUCED BY ACCEPTING THE SKULL'S EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.\nALL THE ABOVE DISEASES ARE NOT THE STUDENTS' DOINGS -- THEY ARE ALL DUE TO THE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS OF BLIND TEACHERS.\nIt will be a great day in the history of man when he becomes at least this much responsible: to realize that to teach something that he himself has not experienced is ugly, is criminal; it is the greatest sin. If false teachers disappear from the world there will be a tremendous revolution, because the people who get caught into the nets of the false teachers are really seekers, but they don't know where to go, they don't know how to judge ... and they can be forgiven because they are only searching and looking.\nIt is the greatest blessing to have found a living master. It is the most difficult thing, because the living master will be condemned by the whole world, so you will be discouraged by the condemnation. The false teachers will be appreciated, honored, respected; naturally, you will think that if the whole world respects, honors, then these must be the right people. It is just the opposite: the authentic master has been always condemned by the contemporaries.\nSo whenever you find a man condemned unanimously by all, he has something; otherwise why should the whole world be disturbed by him? When the world appreciates, respects, gives honors and awards, beware! This is a false teacher. He is honored because he is serving the vested interests of the society.\nIf you can keep this small criterion, it is always possible to find the right master. But without a right master, things which are very simple will become so complicated; things which can happen right now do not happen for lives. Beware of the honored ones!\nIf somebody is condemned, and condemned unanimously, that man is bringing truth into the world, which is living in all kinds of lies.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5781","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part35/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">33 Serenity</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5781 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part35.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part34>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is nothing to attain, there is no goal to reach. You are simply to
relax, be at ease, and you will find that you have always been there,
where you wanted to be. You have never left the Garden of Eden. The
Christian story is wrong.</p><p>I have been talking about the Christian story from so many different
angles ... it is a beautiful story and certainly has tremendous
potential. This aspect has also to be remembered, that wherever you are,
you are still in the Garden of Eden. It is not even in the capacity of
God to throw you out -- where will he throw you? -- because everywhere
is the Garden of Eden. I am always wondering why not a single Christian
theologian has raised the question in two thousand years: God drove Adam
and Eve from the Garden of Eden, but where did he drive them to? Is
there something outside of existence?</p><p>Everything is within, there is nothing without. There are no
boundaries to reality -- you cannot be thrown out of reality. It is such
a simple fact: you are still in the Garden of Eden, you have just fallen
asleep.</p><p>Your sleep consists of your mind, of your desires, your dreams, your
ambitions, your motivations. Once you drop all this crap, suddenly you
wake up and you will find yourself in the Garden of Eden. And the Garden
of Eden does not belong to God, it is not his monopoly. It belongs to
everyone, to every living entity, because God is only a collective name
for all the consciousnesses that exist in the world; God is not some
person.</p><p>The Christian story has made God very ugly. If I have to write the
story again, the first instructions I will give to Adam and Eve -- and
those are the instructions I am giving to you -- will be: Eat the fruit
of wisdom, eat the fruit of eternal life. You belong to the ultimate
consciousness, you belong to deathlessness.</p><p>You are a buddha.</p><p>You just have to be shaken up.</p><p>It is not that you have to do many austerities and knock on the doors
and beg and pray: "God, Father, please open the door. I will never eat
the fruit, I will never look at it." You are sitting under the tree.
Just open your eyes, and wisdom is yours, and eternal life is yours. And
these are not two trees ...</p><p>The story is wrong on many points. First, a God who is a father
cannot prevent you from eternal life, and cannot prevent you from being
wise. Secondly, wisdom and eternal life are not two; they are two
aspects of the same experience.</p><p>I declare to you; this is the Garden of Eden.</p><p>If you want to sleep a little more, there is no harm. There is no
need to be in a hurry either. Sleep well; just stop dreaming ... and you
will wake up. It is the dreams which go on keeping you asleep.</p><p>In other words, I can define meditation as a non-dreaming
consciousness. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>33</p><p>Serenity</p><p>18 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, SILENT ILLUMINATION</p><p>OLD P'ANG SAID, "JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE
REAL ALL THAT DOESN'T EXIST." JUST MASTER THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS, AND
YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S TASK OF STUDY IS COMPLETED.</p><p>THESE DAYS THERE'S A BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS WHOSE OWN EYES
ARE NOT CLEAR, WHO JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO STOP AND REST AND PLAY DEAD.
EVEN IF YOU STOP AND REST LIKE THIS UNTIL A THOUSAND BUDDHAS APPEAR IN
THE WORLD, YOU STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP AND REST -- YOU'LL BE MAKING
YOUR MIND EVEN MORE CONFUSED AND TROUBLED. THEY TEACH PEOPLE TO "KEEP
THE MIND STILL," TO "FORGET FEELINGS" ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES, TO
PRACTICE "SILENT ILLUMINATION." AS THEY GO ON AND ON "ILLUMINATING" AND
"KEEPING THE MIND STILL," THEY ADD TO THEIR CONFUSION AND OPPRESSION,
WITH NO END TO IT. UTTERLY LOSING THE EXPEDIENT MEANS OF THE PATRIARCHS,
THEY INSTRUCT OTHERS WRONGLY, TEACHING PEOPLE TO GO ON IN VAIN AND
WASTEFULLY WITH BIRTH AND DEATH; FURTHERMORE, THEY TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO
CARE ABOUT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS. "SIMPLY GO ON PUTTING THINGS TO REST
THIS WAY," THEY'LL SAY. "WHEN YOU'VE STOPPED FEELINGS AS THEY COME AND
THOUGHTS ARE NOT PRODUCED, AT SUCH A TIME IT'S NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE --
IN FACT, IT'S ALERT AND AWAKE AND PERFECTLY CLEAR." THIS KIND IS EVEN
MORE PERNICIOUS, BLINDING PEOPLES' EYES.</p><p>TO SAY THAT WHEN ONE HAS PUT THINGS TO REST TO THE POINT THAT HE IS
UNAWARES AND UNKNOWING, LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE, THIS IS NOT
UNKNOWING SILENCE -- THIS IS A VIEW BORN OF WRONGLY TAKING TOO LITERALLY
WORDS THAT WERE ONLY EXPEDIENT MEANS TO FREE BONDS. TO TEACH PEOPLE TO
REFLECT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE CARE NOT TO LET ANY BAD
PERCEPTIONS APPEAR -- THIS AGAIN IS AN INTERPRETATION PRODUCED BY
ACCEPTING THE SKULL'S EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p>ALL THE ABOVE DISEASES ARE NOT THE STUDENTS' DOINGS -- THEY'RE ALL
DUE TO THE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS OF BLIND TEACHERS.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has been miserable -- not without reason. The reasons are of his
own making; hence release is possible. But very few people have
experienced absolute freedom.</p><p>There are a thousand and one causes for this calamity which has
happened to humanity. It is just like a vast garden of thousands of
rosebushes, where only once in a while a flower blossoms on a rosebush,
and the remaining thousands of bushes simply remain barren. They have
the same potential, but something has gone wrong in their
structuring.</p><p>Ta Hui is trying here to show a few fundamental errors that have been
made by man -- and he continues to make them -- which hinder his own
growth.</p><p>Most of the causes that have destroyed your dignity, your pride, your
glory, your splendor are the doings of so-called teachers. There is a
subtle egoistic joy in teaching because the moment you teach someone,
without saying anything, you have become higher: you know and the other
does not know. This has created great trouble for human beings.</p><p>So many false teachers go on appearing ... perhaps it is the greatest
crime in the world to teach things which you have not experienced. But
what are your bishops and cardinals and popes, imams and
shankaracharyas? -- just a long line of false teachers. They don't know
what they are saying. They may be quoting the right scriptures, their
words may be coming from right sources, but it is not the sources and
not the scriptures -- it is the man who speaks that is the ultimate
criterion of whether what he says is true or not.</p><p>One great master, Naropa, has repeatedly said one thing: "Don't
listen to what I say, listen to me! It does not matter what I say; what
matters is what I am."</p><p>A true teacher speaks out of spontaneity, experience, awareness, his
own realization. The false teacher is very learned; he knows all the
scriptures, he quotes them beautifully and he can easily deceive people.
In fact it is very difficult not to be deceived by such a person,
because you don't know how to judge. He is speaking the right words, but
his right words are just like a gramophone record. You cannot make a
gramophone record your master; what it is saying is absolutely true, but
there is no one inside. It is just a dead record.</p><p>Your memory is also a dead record. Teachers teach through memory,
masters teach through awareness, intelligence; hence it is possible to
find inconsistencies and contradictions in masters -- in fact, they are
bound to be found. This can be used as a criterion: if somebody is
continuously consistent, he cannot be a master. He is only repeating
things mechanically.</p><p>The master has to respond each moment, and each moment is different.
The master never answers the question; he always answers the questioner
-- and the questioners are different. The master is not concerned
whether what he says is in tune with the scriptures, tradition,
convention, or is against. His whole and sole concern is the real person
whom he is encountering ... nothing else matters.</p><p>But the false teachers have not stopped, and will never stop. It is
so easy to be learned; it is so difficult to be wise. Any idiot can be
learned; all that he needs is a good memory system, a good biocomputer.
But to be an authentic master is a rare flowering, and one has to
understand some indications through which he can make a judgment in
order to avoid the false and to listen to the authentic.</p><p>The first thing is: the false teacher is always repeating somebody
else's words; he has none of his own. All his statements are within
quotation marks. The second thing: the false teacher, howsoever
articulate, learned, clever, will not be able to practice what he
preaches. Look at the man rather than looking at his words, and you will
see the disparity.</p><p>In one small village there were two brothers, twin brothers. One was
a doctor and the other was a priest, and the whole village always had
difficulty in recognizing which was which. A</p><p>stranger had come to the town. He saw both of them and he could not
believe his eyes. They were not exactly alike, but they used to have the
same clothes, the same hairstyle, and it was almost impossible to make a
distinction. He approached one of them and said, "Is there a way to
distinguish between you two? Only you can say ..."</p><p>This brother was the doctor, and he said, "Yes, there is only one
way: he preaches and I practice!"</p><p>The false teacher only preaches. If you look at his practice you will
be very much disappointed; he goes against his own statements
continuously.</p><p>Thirdly -- and this needs a little more intelligence and awareness to
see -- the false teacher is always hesitant. He himself is not certain
whether what he is saying is true or not because it is all borrowed. But
the true teacher is an absolute authority. What he says he means, and he
says only that which he means.</p><p>The teacher is only paying lip service to all the good things that
you have been told. You will not find any original freshness; he stinks
of dead corpses, very ancient corpses. The authentic master has a
freshness, a newness. You may go on hearing him for ages, but you will
never feel that he is stale because it is always coming from the
original source.</p><p>Consider the things that Ta Hui wants to point out to you: OLD P'ANG
SAID, "JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE REAL ALL THAT
DOES NOT EXIST." JUST MASTER THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS, AND YOUR WHOLE
LIFE'S TASK OF STUDY IS COMPLETED.</p><p>With the masters you will always find something strange, because you
are unfamiliar with their world; it is untrodden. With the teachers you
will find very familiar things which you already know -- you have heard
them. In every church the same sermon, in every temple the same
discourse; the whole atmosphere is filled with old and rotten
statements.</p><p>With the real master you will always find something strange, some
wildflower which does not grow in ordinary day to day gardens. Its
taste, its fragrance, its color, its form -- everything will have a
newness.</p><p>Now what master P'ang says is absolutely unique. Nobody has ever said
that: "JUST RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS. He is making two
statements. And in those two statements, Ta Hui says, your whole
religion is complete: "RESOLVE TO EMPTY ALL THAT EXISTS: DON'T MAKE REAL
ALL THAT DOES NOT EXIST."</p><p>But people are doing just the opposite: they go on creating the
unreal -- that which does not exist. What do you know about God? Yet
millions of people every day are praying to a fiction. It is pathology.
What do you know about heaven and hell? But they have entered deep into
your psychology: you are greedy for heaven, afraid of hell -- and these
are all nonexistent things.</p><p>P'ang is saying, "Don't create that which does not exist; and that
which exists, empty your mind of all attachment to it, of all
infatuation with it." Your infatuation is your bondage; if you are not
infatuated with that which exists, and you are not imaginative in
creating gods and ghosts, what is left?</p><p>A simple silence ... A pure serenity ...</p><p>An undisturbed, unruffled consciousness.</p><p>And that is it!</p><p>Hence old P'ang is right. Within two simple sentences he has
condensed all the teachings of all the awakened people. There are
thousands of scriptures, but these two statements are enough; anything
else is just unnecessary fabrication by the deluded people for the
deluded people.</p><p>People can get concerned with such stupid things -- you cannot
believe it.</p><p>Christian theologians of the middle ages had argued for centuries in
great treatises. You will not believe what kind of idiots these
theologians were. Their problem was how many angels can stand on the
head of a pin. Why were they concerned? -- but it became such a big
problem as if their life depended on whether one angel more or less can
stand there. Those angels are fictitious -- and why should even those
fictitious angels stand on the head of a pin?</p><p>But it was a very serious matter, and for three or four centuries it
was debated almost continuously by great theologians, philosophers. If
you look into the history of religions you will find such stupidities
that you cannot believe that this is our heritage, that these are the
old sources of our so-called great religions.</p><p>For two thousand years Christians had been arguing and insisting that
Jesus was born of a virgin -- Mary. Now what does it matter? Even if he
was born of Virgin Mary, he can be wrong. Just by being born of a
virgin, you don't become right; in fact, more is the possibility that
from the very beginning you are wrong. But even today the pope insists
that this is their fundamental principle. What will Christianity be if
three fictions are removed? One is the virgin birth of Jesus, which can
be cancelled without any trouble.</p><p>One young girl was brought to a doctor by her mother, who was an old
friend. She was very much worried because it was so apparent that the
girl was at least seven or eight months pregnant -- there was no need
for any test. Still the doctor took the test and he said, "I am sorry,
but nothing can be done. It is too late now; abortion is dangerous. The
girl is pregnant."</p><p>But the mother said, "How it can be? Because I never allow her any
chances ..."</p><p>And the girl said, "I have not even touched the hand of any man. How
I can be pregnant?"</p><p>The doctor looked at both of them and went to the window and looked
at the sky. For a moment there was silence. Then the mother said, "What
are you doing there?"</p><p>He said, "I am waiting for the three wise men from the East. If it is
true that she has not even touched the hand of a man, and you insist ...
then the miracle has happened again: she is a virgin mother. You should
rejoice. Why you are looking so miserable?"</p><p>Just a few days ago the pope has again insisted ... A few Christian
thinkers are feeling awkward about this virgin birth, but he has
insisted that it is "one of our greatest pillars".</p><p>The second pillar is that Jesus is the only begotten son of God.
Nobody knows about this fellow God -- and except for Jesus' own
statement, there is no other evidence or any proof. But the whole of
Christianity depends on the statement of Jesus. No contemporary thinker,
no contemporary literature even bothers to mention that Jesus is the son
of God -- and not only the son, but the only begotten son. It is great:
fictions are creating sons and daughters! And we have no evidence of
their own existence ...</p><p>And what is so great in Jesus that he should be the only begotten son
of God? Why not Gautam Buddha, why not Bodhidharma, why not
Mahakashyapa, why not Ta Hui -- why not</p><p>you? You just need a little courage and a little craziness and you
can declare: "I am the only begotten son of God." No proofs are needed,
because even Jesus has not given any proofs.</p><p>And the third: the trinity of God the father, Jesus the son, and the
holy ghost. This holy ghost is the strangest guy you can come across.
This holy ghost is the person who made the poor virgin Mary pregnant --
and still he is holy. Then what is the meaning of unholy?</p><p>And it is strange ... for centuries Christians themselves have
insisted that it looks strange, this trinity, because there is no woman
in it. It looks incomplete; it does not look like a complete family.
What is wrong in accepting Mary, who is worshipped by Catholics as part
of this hierarchy? But the woman, just because she is the woman, cannot
be accepted on that high pedestal. The criminal ghost can be
accepted.</p><p>Just the other day an Italian sannyasin has told me that he wants to
put on record -- he is collecting my statements -- what I think about
illegitimate children. I said to him, "There are no illegitimate
children, there are only illegitimate parents." How can a child be
illegitimate? And who are the illegitimate parents? -- not necessarily
those who are not married. Any child who is not born of love makes the
parents illegitimate. Whether they are married or not is irrelevant --
but the child certainly is never illegitimate.</p><p>This illegitimate person, the holy ghost, is part of God's trinity;
he is part of God. These are three phases of God -- but the woman cannot
be accepted.</p><p>These are the three fundamentals, the three pillars of Christianity.
If you remove these three, the whole edifice of two thousand years
disappears like a soap bubble. But what is so great in all these ideas?
Those who have been teaching these ideas can only be called false
teachers, misguiding humanity. You cannot question them; your question
will bring you condemnation. And this is not only so about Christianity;
this is so about all the religions. Religion should be very simple, a
pure and innocent affair. It should not be made complicated by
unnecessary superstitions, stupidities.</p><p>Old P'ang has given you the whole of religion in two small
statements: "Empty yourself of all attachment, of all infatuation, of
all ambition for that which exists." And "Don't create fictions."
Nothing more is needed.</p><p>This is an authentic master, bringing the essential, pure serenity of
your being in tune with the blissfulness of existence.</p><p>You are one with this silence ... and how marvelous it is ... and how
wonderful. Can you think that something more is needed to rejoice and
dance and sing?</p><p>Religion, to be authentic, has to be concerned with man's
transformation, not with these stupid ideas; whether they are real or
unreal does not matter.</p><p>THESE DAYS ... and unfortunately, although one thousand years have
passed since Ta Hui, "these days" still continue. THESE DAYS THERE'S A
BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS ...</p><p>I want to emphasize the word outsiders. Humanity can be divided in
that way very easily -- the insiders and the outsiders. The insiders are
very few -- those who know the inside story, the inside mystery. And the
outsiders are the millions who are just standing outside of themselves,
never trying to figure out what it is that makes them tick, what it is
that is their life, what it is that is their consciousness, what it is
that is their love ... simple matters.</p><p>The outsiders are concerned with faraway stars, quasars, remote
galaxies ... so remote that there is no possibility that the earth will
ever come in contact with them, because the universe has been found to
be expanding. It is just like a balloon which goes on becoming bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger, and all the stars that you see are
moving away from some center, which science has not yet been able to
locate. But there is some center from which all these stars are moving
at tremendous speed.</p><p>Now the old fools were concerned with God, the holy ghost, the virgin
birth, and the new fools are concerned with the galaxies, millions of
light-years away. They have changed their objects but they have not
changed their vision: they are still looking outwards. The outsider is
one who is always looking outside. He is never at home.</p><p>Religion is basically the experience of the insider. He closes his
eyes and enters into the depths of his being, into the silences of his
heart, and finally into the mysterious source of life, of all life, of
all consciousness.</p><p>This is the only contentment, the only fulfillment, the only
realization. For the first time there are no longer any problems, no
longer any questions. You don't know anything, but your capacity of
knowing is absolutely clear. You are just a pure mirror without any
dust.</p><p>THESE DAYS THERE IS A BREED OF SHAVEN-HEADED OUTSIDERS WHOSE OWN EYES
ARE NOT CLEAR, WHO JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO STOP AND REST</p><p>AND PLAY DEAD. Most of the religions have been teaching you to
renounce the world, which cuts off most of your life. To renounce all
pleasures cuts off your remaining life. "Become more and more dead, and
you will come closer and closer to God." This is a very strange god
...</p><p>God can be synonymous with life, then it has some meaning. But God
synonymous with death ...? But this is what your saints have done: they
have become fossils. Although they breathe, they have died to life in
all its concerns. They have withdrawn all their sensitivity, their love,
their joy; they have become shrunken.</p><p>So Ta Hui is right: EVEN IF YOU STOP AND REST LIKE THIS UNTIL A
THOUSAND BUDDHAS APPEAR IN THE WORLD, YOU STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP
AND REST -- YOU WILL BE MAKING YOUR MIND EVEN MORE CONFUSED</p><p>AND TROUBLED. This overwhelming, poisonous idea of renouncing the
world, of renouncing pleasures, of renouncing the body, of renouncing
all that can make your life a little juicy, a little musical, a little
poetic, and just being like a stone ... still your mind inside will be
in turmoil.</p><p>There is a beautiful story from Mulla Nasruddin's life. He had been
cutting wood and his donkey was standing by the side; he would load the
wood on the donkey and take it home. But he was feeling very tired, and
it was a hot afternoon and the shadow of the tree was alluring, so he
allowed himself a little relaxation.</p><p>Just then a group of wolves came around. Seeing the wolves, Mulla
thought it is better to pretend to be dead, because it is known that
wolves don't eat dead corpses. They want fresh food; they are not
interested in canned food! So he stopped his breathing, but from the
corner of his eye he was looking about for the donkey, because that was
the problem: he himself is pretending to be dead, but the donkey is a
fool ... and those wolves started eating his donkey.</p><p>Now he is seeing it and there is a great turmoil inside -- but he is
pretending to be dead. Finally he forgot and said, "Okay, you can kill
my donkey because I am dead. If I had been</p><p>alive I would have shown you what it means to attack my donkey!" This
was going on inside his mind, and it came out of his mouth! It was just
a coincidence that a few people arrived and he was saved.</p><p>But I want to tell you this story because he was pretending to be
dead, although he was not. All your saints are pretending to be dead;
they are not dead. How can they be? But all the religions have respected
these dead people. And because of this respect for dead people, as a
counterpart, there is a condemnation for living people. To be alive,
fully alive, singing and dancing, rejoicing in the pleasures of
existence, has become a sin according to all religions. Condensed to the
essentials: life is sin and death is virtue.</p><p>My own experience is just the opposite, the opposite of all these
religions. Life is virtue, and the more alive you are, the more
virtuous; the more sensitive you are, the more religious; the more
dimensions your life has, the more spiritual. Leave that old style of
saintliness to the idiots because they cannot do anything else; but they
can do that saintliness perfectly. My own understanding is that all your
great saints are perfect idiots. They have not understood even the ABC
of the mysteries of life, and they have fallen into the trap of false
teachers.</p><p>THEY TEACH PEOPLE TO "KEEP THE MIND STILL," TO "FORGET FEELINGS"
ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES, TO PRACTICE "SILENT ILLUMINATION." They</p><p>use beautiful words because all those words are available in
thousands of scriptures, but they don't know that one cannot keep the
mind still. Either you have the mind or you don't have it. A still mind
is a contradiction in terms.</p><p>One famous American rabbi, Joshua Liebman -- I don't know whether he
is still alive or not -- has written a book, PEACE OF MIND. I was a
student in the university when I came across the book. I wrote to him in
a letter: "Even the title of your book is a contradiction in terms.
'Peace of mind' is simply absurd. When mind is not, there is peace; when
mind is, there is no peace. Hence, 'peace of mind' is simply befooling
people. But perhaps you yourself think ..."</p><p>His book has been sold in millions because everybody wants peace of
mind -- and so cheap, in a paperback edition! But I have never come
across any man who has attained peace of mind by reading Rabbi Joshua
Liebman's book. I was in the habit of writing letters to people, but it
is an unfortunate situation that none of them had the courage to answer.
Perhaps they could see the point, and it was better to remain
silent.</p><p>These people who are telling others, "Keep the mind still" ... who is
going to keep the mind still? You cannot force the mind to stillness.
Mind has to be transcended, and in the transcendence of mind, in the
realization that you are not the mind, suddenly the stillness, the
peace, the calm, the quietude.</p><p>AS THEY GO ON AND ON "ILLUMINATING" AND "KEEPING THE MIND STILL,"
THEY ADD TO THEIR CONFUSION AND OPPRESSION, WITH NO END TO IT. UTTERLY
LOSING THE EXPEDIENT MEANS OF THE PATRIARCHS, THEY INSTRUCT OTHERS
WRONGLY, TEACHING PEOPLE TO GO ON IN VAIN AND WASTEFULLY WITH BIRTH AND
DEATH; FURTHERMORE, THEY TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS STATE OF
AFFAIRS. "SIMPLY GO ON PUTTING THINGS TO REST THIS WAY," THEY WILL SAY.
"WHEN YOU HAVE STOPPED FEELINGS AS THEY COME AND THOUGHTS ARE NOT
PRODUCED, AT SUCH A TIME IT IS NOT UNKNOWING SILENCE -- IN FACT, IT IS
ALERT AND AWAKE AND PERFECTLY CLEAR."</p><p>These are deeper realities of life. You can attain a certain state of
controlled silence, forced silence, but it will be dead. It will be like
a bird on the wing that looks so beautiful. You catch hold of it and you
put it in a golden cage; you may think it is the same bird -- it is not.
Apparently it is, but the bird on the wing and the bird -- the same bird
-- inside the cage are two different beings.</p><p>The bird on the wing has the whole sky ... he has a soul, he has an
individuality, he has a beauty. The same bird inside the cage is just
dead. It has lost its sky, it has lost its freedom, it has lost its
individuality -- and what has it gained? To the bird the golden cage
does not mean anything; gold or steel are just the same.</p><p>In the name of religion people have been trying to force themselves
into a cage of discipline, precepts, hoping that they will attain to
great illumination, alertness, awareness, enlightenment. It is not
possible. If you want to be aware you have to start with awareness. If
you want to be free you have to start with freedom. Whatever you want to
be, your first step is the indication of your last.</p><p>Finding realization ... You cannot do it by making yourself a slave
of doctrines, precepts, moralities and hope that these will bring
awareness, the ultimate flowering of your being.</p><p>It is true that if the ultimate flowering of awareness happens you
will have a morality, but that morality will have a totally different
nuance to it. It will be your own, not Moses', not Manu's, not
Confucius'. It will not be a bondage, it will not be a burden, it will
not be a commandment that you have to do. You will simply rejoice in
doing it. It will not be a duty. It will be simply your joy.</p><p>I have heard that when God created the world he went to the
Babylonians and said, "Would you like to have a commandment?"</p><p>They said, "What is the commandment?" He said, "Thou shall not commit
adultery."</p><p>They said, "Forgive us, without adultery what is the point of living.
You just find somebody else ...!"</p><p>He went to the Egyptians, he went all around, and nobody was ready to
accept a commandment -- and I think they were all right. Commandments
cannot be from somebody else, otherwise they make you a slave. They
should arise from your own understanding; then they are not
commandments, they are sheer joy.</p><p>But poor Moses got into trouble. Being a Jew, he asked the wrong
question. When God asked, "Moses, baby, would you like to have a
commandment?", Moses asked, "How much does it cost?" He did not ask what
the commandment is! -- he asked the price!</p><p>God said, "It is free!"</p><p>Moses said, "Then I will have ten!" If it is free ... And under those
ten commandments, for four thousand years the Jews have been
crushed.</p><p>You certainly need a morality but it has to arise out of your own
love, out of your own reverence for life. It has to be your own; it
needs your signature. It cannot be a blind belief, it cannot be a duty
that you have been conditioned to fulfill. It has to be your freedom. An
authentically religious man is amoral; he has no morality, ready-made.
Each moment he responds with love and reverence and that is his
morality.</p><p>THIS KIND IS EVEN MORE PERNICIOUS, BLINDING PEOPLES' EYES. When</p><p>teachers start talking about illumination, enlightenment, stilling
the mind, they use beautiful words to create a prison cell for you. What
you need is freedom from all prisons.</p><p>The past has been continuously creating prisons upon prisons. You
need a release, and only you can give this gift to yourself. I can only
make you aware that you have the capacity -- that's the function of the
master. He can only make you aware of your potential, of your
possibilities, and then he leaves you to your own decision.</p><p>TO SAY THAT WHEN ONE HAS PUT THINGS TO REST TO THE POINT THAT HE IS
UNAWARES AND UNKNOWING, LIKE EARTH, WOOD, TILE, OR STONE, THIS IS NOT
UNKNOWING SILENCE -- THIS IS A VIEW BORN OF WRONGLY TAKING TOO LITERALLY
WORDS THAT WERE ONLY EXPEDIENT MEANS TO FREE BONDS.</p><p>The false teachers are collecting words, beautiful words. They are
good collectors but they don't know the context, because the context is
not present in the scriptures. The context is always present in a living
master.</p><p>TO TEACH PEOPLE TO REFLECT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE CARE
NOT TO LET ANY BAD PERCEPTIONS APPEAR -- THIS AGAIN IS AN INTERPRETATION
PRODUCED BY ACCEPTING THE SKULL'S EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p>ALL THE ABOVE DISEASES ARE NOT THE STUDENTS' DOINGS -- THEY ARE ALL
DUE TO THE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS OF BLIND TEACHERS.</p><p>It will be a great day in the history of man when he becomes at least
this much responsible: to realize that to teach something that he
himself has not experienced is ugly, is criminal; it is the greatest
sin. If false teachers disappear from the world there will be a
tremendous revolution, because the people who get caught into the nets
of the false teachers are really seekers, but they don't know where to
go, they don't know how to judge ... and they can be forgiven because
they are only searching and looking.</p><p>It is the greatest blessing to have found a living master. It is the
most difficult thing, because the living master will be condemned by the
whole world, so you will be discouraged by the condemnation. The false
teachers will be appreciated, honored, respected; naturally, you will
think that if the whole world respects, honors, then these must be the
right people. It is just the opposite: the authentic master has been
always condemned by the contemporaries.</p><p>So whenever you find a man condemned unanimously by all, he has
something; otherwise why should the whole world be disturbed by him?
When the world appreciates, respects, gives honors and awards, beware!
This is a false teacher. He is honored because he is serving the vested
interests of the society.</p><p>If you can keep this small criterion, it is always possible to find
the right master. But without a right master, things which are very
simple will become so complicated; things which can happen right now do
not happen for lives. Beware of the honored ones!</p><p>If somebody is condemned, and condemned unanimously, that man is
bringing truth into the world, which is living in all kinds of lies.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part34>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

No word is capable to describe it. You can experience it, but you cannot explain it. You can have it, but you cannot say anything about it. Only your silence may give a little indication of the tremendous vastness of existence, of life, of consciousness.\nEnlightenment is only an effort to make you aware of your infinity, of your eternity. You are the whole past.\nYou are the whole present. You are the whole future.\nThe moment one comes to know it is the most blessed moment. You have fulfilled your destiny, you have come home; now there is nothing else beyond it. This is the only richness, this is the only victory. All else is mundane; only this experience is the sacred.\nAnd to be filled with this sacredness, nothing much is needed on your part -- just a silent mind, a peaceful heart, a wordless, thoughtless serenity. Suddenly you are no more the dewdrop; instantly you have become the ocean itself. To know the ocean there is only one way ... to become it.\nTa Hui is coming to the close of his journey. He started as an intellectual, but he was a fortunate intellectual; he did not get lost in words and theories and arguments. He managed to get beyond the mind, and now he is making statements which belong to the beyond, which are not arguments but only hints for those who are in search.\nThe whole journey of Ta Hui is significant because it is the journey of everyone who moves from ignorance to innocence, from mind to mindlessness, from darkness to ultimate light.\nIt is your journey.\nGoing with Ta Hui, step by step, will help you immensely, because there is no other book that I have come across which describes the whole transformation. All other books come after enlightenment; people have spoken only when they have known. This is a special case. We start with a teacher and we end up with a great master.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\n37\nThis moment\n20 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO,\nA TALK TO THE ASSEMBLY (PART THREE)\nDON'T REMEMBER WHAT I'VE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT RIGHT. TODAY I SPEAK THIS WAY, BUT THEN TOMORROW I'LL SPEAK OTHERWISE. AS SOON AS YOU'RE THUS, I AM NOT THUS; WHEN YOU'RE NOT THUS, THEN I AM THUS. WHERE WILL YOU SEARCH OUT MY ABIDING PLACE? SINCE I MYSELF DON'T EVEN KNOW, HOW CAN ANYONE ELSE FIND WHERE I STAY?\nTHIS IS THE LIVING GATE: YOU CAN ENTER ONLY WHEN YOU'VE PUT TO DEATH YOUR FABRICATED \"REALITY.\" YET STUDENTS CONSIDER PAYING HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA, UPHOLDING THE SCRIPTURES, AND DISCIPLINING THEMSELVES IN BODY, MOUTH, AND MIND, AS THEIR SUSTENANCE, HOPING TO FIND REALIZATION. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH IT? THEY ARE LIKE FOOLS INTENT ON GOING WEST TO GET SOMETHING IN THE EAST -- THE FARTHER THEY GO, THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE; THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY. THIS IS THE GATE OF THE GREAT DHARMA: UNCONDITIONED, UNDEFILED, WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHMENT. IF YOU AROUSE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF GAINING EXPERIENCE OF IT, YOU ARE RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. HOW CAN YOU HOPE FOR IT, WANTING TO RELY ON SOME PETTY, CONTRIVED ACCOMPLISHMENTS?\nIT'S NOT A FORCED ACTION: THE DHARMA IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIKE THIS. DON'T TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS -- THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS PEOPLE.\nThis morning it is raining so beautifully.\nTomorrow ... one never knows; it may be sunny, the clouds may have disappeared.\nThis morning the cuckoo is continuously singing, tomorrow it may have gone. Life is such. You cannot ask permanency, consistency, that things should always remain the same.\nWatching life you will come to know the very secret, and you will also become aware that mind is not functioning according to life. Mind believes in consistency; it wants that it should rain every morning, just the same. Mind is not able to cope with the unknown, with the spontaneous, with the ever-renewing existence.\nThe disparity between mind and life is the whole problem. Either you listen to the mind ... then you live in misery, because life is not going to fulfill the demands of the mind. Unfulfilled, miserable, your life will become just a long drawnout tragedy. But nobody else except you is responsible. You listened to the wrong adviser: you should have listened to life, not to mind.\nMind is a small mechanism, good for day-to-day affairs, good for the marketplace, but if you want to enter into the vastness of existence mind is absolutely incapable. But you are accustomed to the mind, and even when you are seeking for truth or for love or for the ultimate meaning you go on carrying your old mind, which is absolutely a hindrance; it is not a help on the way.\nIf you listen to life instead of mind, things are very simple. You never say to life, \"You are contradictory. Yesterday there was no rain and today it is raining. Yesterday it was hot and today it is cold.\" You simply accept life as it comes -- there is no other way. It is one of those inescapables Ta Hui has talked of before. It is unavoidable.\nThe child will become a young man, the young man will become old, and the old man will die. A man of understanding simply accepts this whole flux, change, without any resistance, because he knows this is how things are. By your expectations they don't change. Your expectations only create frustrations for you.\nMy whole life I have been told, \"You have said something a few years before; now you are saying something else. Your philosophy is contradictory, you are not consistent.\"\nAnd they have been shocked when I told them, \"Yes, you are right. But it is not an objection against me, it is a compliment. It means my philosophy is in tune with life. It changes ... the climate changes, the season changes. Sometimes it is fall and the trees are standing naked; against the sky they have their own beauty. And sometimes it is spring, and the trees are so green with foliage and ready to shower their flowers for anyone who happens to be nearby. No introduction is needed, no acquaintance is needed; the friend and the foe are both treated the same way.\"\nFrom my very childhood I watched the river of my village swelling in the rains, becoming so vast as if it is the ocean itself. In summer it shrinks to a small stream. I have told people, \"You don't ever say to the river, 'Your behavior is very inconsistent.' You never ask the flowers, you never ask the birds, 'Why are you not singing today? What has happened?' But you go on asking about philosophies, ideologies, whether they are consistent or not.\"\nOnce and for all, in a single blow, you have to drop the idea of consistency. It is a by-product of the training of your mind. Mind cannot be with the inconsistent -- but life is inconsistent. I am not responsible for it, and neither are you. Nobody is responsible for it; it simply happens to be so. And it is beautiful.\nTa Hui is making a great statement. No philosopher can make such a statement, only a mystic who has put his mind aside and looks directly into existence and becomes aware of its constantly changing flux. Except for change, everything changes. The only permanent thing in the world is change. And the moment you ask things not to change, you are creating misery for yourself.\nTa Hui says, DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT RIGHT.\nMysticism is not academic, it is not an ordinary school. It belongs to the beyond, the ultimate and the mysterious. If you live with a living master, you have to learn that. There is no need to remember what he has said yesterday. Yesterday was yesterday; today is today.\nA living master responds to reality moment to moment; he never bothers whether it is consistent with yesterday or not. His only concern is whether it is true to the moment or not; whether his response to the moment is authentic or not. If it is authentic, then there is no need to bother what he has said yesterday or the day before yesterday.\nThis is where the philosopher and the mystic differ. Philosophers remain consistent; they avoid inconsistency. Their only fear is to commit a mistake, to say something which goes against something that they have said before. But just because of this consistency they remain unaware of the mysteries of existence, they remain confined in their mind. They never come to know the rain, the sun, the moon, the trees, the children playing. This whole drama of tremendous beauty is missed by the so-called philosophers.\nBut strangely enough they are the people who dominate the mind of humanity. There is a natural reason: they can dominate the mind because mind loves consistency and philosophers are consistent people.\nTa Hui is saying: DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT\nRIGHT ... The day has passed, the statement is out of date. 'Right' belongs to the present. Never compare dead corpses with living people; never compare flowers which have disappeared with the flowers that are blossoming now, otherwise you will be getting into a confusion. To come out of such a confusion is very difficult, almost impossible. It is good to remember it from the very beginning: DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID.\nTeachers go on saying to the students, \"Remember what I'm saying to you.\" Only a master can say to the disciples, \"Forget all that I have said to you. When it was needed, when it was a response to something actual, it was said and you heard it, and you absorbed it. Now there is no need to remember it. It has become part of you.\"\nMemory never becomes part of you. That's why after the universities your so-called gold medalists, your so-called first-class people, simply disappear in the world; nobody ever hears about them. What happened? They were so great in the university. They should have made a remarkable life outside the university; they should have left a mark in the world; they should have left their signature in life. But nobody ever hears about them, and the reason is that in the university memory is all. They were good at remembering.\nIn life just memory is of no use. In life something more and something better -- intelligence, spontaneity, being in tune moment to moment with all the changes that are happening -- is needed. A man who is stuck with his memories falls far away from life. That's what happens to your so-called scholars. They know much about scriptures, but they know nothing about life.\nDON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT RIGHT. TODAY I\nSPEAK THIS WAY ... because today is today. It has never been before, and it will never be again. It is absolutely new and fresh. It is not a repetition, it is not a continuation either. Life goes on jumping from moment to moment abruptly.\nDo you see this rain? Abruptly it starts, abruptly it is gone, abruptly it becomes intense and for no other reason becomes soft again.\nTODAY I SPEAK THIS WAY, BUT THEN TOMORROW I WILL SPEAK\nOTHERWISE. Ta Hui knows one thing certainly: tomorrow is not going to be the same. Naturally he can say with confidence, TOMORROW I WILL SPEAK OTHERWISE ...\" and if you go on collecting what I say, you will become puzzled. You will start wondering what is right and what is wrong.\"\nAs far as the mystics are concerned, their statements are not to be considered the way you consider the statements of philosophers. You have to look at the mystic; his statements are\nonly responses to changing life. You have to see that the mystic is always in the moment; he never looks back, he never looks ahead. Feeling this will bring you closer to the mystic.\nI have heard an ancient story ... A drunkard went in the night, after getting completely drunk, to a sweet shop and he purchased some sweets. He gave a ten rupee note, but the shopkeeper said \"I don't have any change. Tomorrow you can collect the remaining rupees; right now I don't have them. Either you can keep your ten rupees and tomorrow you can pay, or you can leave ten rupees and tomorrow you can take the remaining part.\"\nThe drunkard said, \"I am not in a fit state; I may forget those ten rupees somewhere. You keep it. Tomorrow I will collect them.\"\nBut in his drunkenness -- confused and dismal -- still he thought, \"I should remember exactly the name of the shop, the face of the man, exactly where the place is, because tomorrow morning I will not be drunk and I will have to remember. I should make something special as a mark so that this man cannot deceive me.\"\nHe looked all around. He could not see anything except a bull sitting in front of the shop. He said, \"That's right. This man could change the sign; tomorrow his father or his brother may be sitting there and they can simply refuse, saying, 'You never came last night' -- but they won't think about the bull who is so silently sitting.\"\nHappily he left, and the next morning he came to collect his money. But the bull was sitting before a barber's saloon. The drunkard said, \"My God! Just for a few rupees you have changed the sign; you have changed even your profession -- you have become a barber just for a few rupees!\"\nThe barber said, \"What nonsense you are talking! I have been a barber always.\"\nThe drunkard said, \"You cannot deceive me. Look at the bull; he is still sitting silently where I had left him last night.\"\nThe drunkard was behaving like a philosopher, finding a certain consistency. Reality is different. The bull can change places; there is no obligation for him to sit continuously before the sweet shop -- he can sit anywhere. Life goes on changing.\nA mystic is committed to life, not to his own statements. Those statements are old newspapers. He remains alert moment to moment and he remains alert to the disciple, his changes. Your questions may be the same, but the master may answer differently because you are not the same. And the question is not important; you are important.\nAS SOON AS YOU ARE THUS, I AM NOT THUS ... Living with a master one has to be flexible, not dogmatic. Whatever the master is saying is not an ultimate statement -- no statement can be ultimate. So don't take it as an ultimate answer, because tomorrow he will change and then you will be in a difficulty.\nYour mind would like to remain with the past because it has become familiar, accustomed to the statement. Now this new statement disturbs the mind and its constant search for consistency.\nTa Hui is saying, AS SOON AS YOU ARE THUS, I AM NOT THUS; WHEN YOU ARE NOT THUS, THEN I AM THUS. WHERE WILL YOU SEARCH OUT MY ABIDING PLACE? SINCE I MYSELF DON'T EVEN KNOW, HOW CAN ANYONE ELSE FIND WHERE I STAY?\nThe mystic has no philosophy as such. You will be surprised to know that in India we don't have any equivalent word for philosophy. The word that India has used for centuries and which has now become synonymous with philosophy is darshan.\nDarshan has a totally different meaning. Darshan means clarity of vision, ability to see; it has nothing to do with philosophy. Philosophy literally means love of knowledge, love of wisdom. Darshan means seeing the reality and responding accordingly. Philosophy is of the mind, darshan is of meditation.\nTHIS IS THE LIVING GATE ... this understanding that life is changing, you are changing, everything is changing. Don't cling to anything, don't be a fanatic; don't be a fundamentalist Christian, don't be a Hindu. How can you be a Hindu? Five thousand years ago your scriptures were written; in five thousand years the bull has moved! Bulls are not predictable, they are very free, beautiful animals. And you are still holding the dead scripture, and thinking you are a Hindu, you are a Mohammedan, you are a Christian, you are a Communist.\nBelonging to the past -- even the closest past, yesterday -- is a wrong approach. Not to belong to anything but to remain available to whatever life brings to you -- this is the living gate. Then every moment is an excitement and every moment is a discovery and every moment is a challenge. Every moment you have to grow because you have to learn to respond in a way you have never responded. You become mature.\nAll fanatics, fundamentalists, fascists remain retarded. They are living in the past, which is no more. They are completely blind as far as the reality is concerned. They go on seeing things which have disappeared from the scene, and they are incapable ... they really avoid seeing what has become real.\nYOU CAN ENTER ONLY WHEN YOU'VE PUT TO DEATH YOUR FABRICATED\n\"REALITY.\" Unless you learn the art of dying every moment to the past, you are not really living. The past goes on becoming heavier and heavier, because the past is growing every day. And your future is so fragile, so small, that the past does not allow you to live in the present. It pulls you backwards.\nIt is as if you, being a fundamentalist, go on insisting, \"I will continue to use my underwear from my childhood.\" You will be a phenomenon ...!\nI have heard about a man who had ordered a tailor to make a beautiful suit for him. He was going to a marriage celebration in a few days, \"so make it really beautiful.\" The suit was made, the man tried it and he could not believe it: one arm of the coat was long, the other arm was short; one leg of the suit was long, another was short. He said, \"What kind of thing have you made?\"\nThe tailor said, \"Nothing is wrong with it. The arm of the coat which is short ... you just pull your hand inside!\"\nHe said, \"This is a difficult job, continuously to keep the hand pulled inside. And what about the other hand?\"\nThe tailor said, \"You put your hand outside, and you have to do the same with your legs.\"\nYou can conceive ... and the tailor said, \"It is such a beautiful suit. I have worked day and night over it, and you complain about small things!\"\nSo the poor fellow went out. A couple came by and the woman said, \"Look at that poor fellow. He seems to be paralyzed or crippled. What has happened to him? One arm is short, one arm is long, and the way he is walking ...!\"\nBut the man said, \"Forget about him, look at the suit; it is really beautiful. And what can the tailor do? -- if the man is like that, the tailor has done the best he could do.\"\nAlmost everybody in the world -- the Christian, the Hindu, the Jaina, the Buddhist, the Mohammedan, the Jew -- they are all wearing coats and suffering immensely. One hand has to be kept pulled in, another has to be kept pulled out. Man is not important, but doctrines, philosophies, ideologies are important. They are not for man, but man is for them; he has to fit accordingly.\nEvery idea that comes from the past is crippling your consciousness. You have to learn the art of dying to everything that has passed, so that you can live in the present with totality, with no burden. And when the present moves, you also move, because now the present is becoming past -- die to it.\nAlways remember that the fresh, the present has to be totally lived, and anything that hinders has to be dropped. Don't bother about being consistent; otherwise to be consistent you will have to wear for your whole life the underwear that you happened to wear in childhood. Then you cannot be inconsistent; you have to be consistent, however you suffer -- and you are going to suffer. Your whole life will be destroyed by underwear that is to small. You cannot walk, you cannot sit, you cannot talk; you have always to consider the underwear. But everybody is in the same psychological position.\nTa Hui's golden gate is certainly a golden gate. YOU CAN ENTER ONLY WHEN YOU'VE PUT TO DEATH YOUR FABRICATED \"REALITY.\" YET STUDENTS CONSIDER PAYING HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA, UPHOLDING THE SCRIPTURES, AND DISCIPLINING THEMSELVES IN BODY, MOUTH, AND MIND, AS THEIR SUSTENANCE, HOPING TO FIND REALIZATION. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH IT? THEY ARE LIKE FOOLS INTENT ON GOING WEST TO GET SOMETHING IN THE EAST -- THE FARTHER THEY GO, THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE; THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY.\nA few things that he has said ... First, remain fresh and clean; go on dropping the dust that naturally gathers as time passes by.\nOne Zen master, Rinzai, was sent by his own master to another master. This has been a tradition in Zen, that sometimes masters sent their disciples to different masters just so that they don't become accustomed to a certain way, a certain style; they don't become fixed, they remain flexible. Naturally a different master will have a different style -- and Zen masters are very unique people.\nThe disciple went to the other master, and he was very much puzzled. What he heard there was almost in contradiction to what he had been hearing from his own master. He asked the new master, \"What am I to do? I have come from a master -- he has sent me -- and I have become accustomed to a certain way of life, a certain way of thinking, and here things are totally different.\"\nThe master said, \"Forget your old master and forget all that you have learned there. One of the greatest principles of learning is the art of forgetting. You have heard that learning is the\nart of remembering, but you can remember the new only if you forget the old. So forget the old! While you are here, be here!\"\nAfter a year or two he became accustomed to the new master, and as he was becoming more and more familiar, relaxed, and the conflict was disappearing, the master said, \"Now you go back to your old master.\"\nThe disciple said, \"This is a strange thing. It took me two years to forget that fellow, and now to go back again ...\"\nThe master said, \"You will not find the same fellow, because in two years he must have changed.\"\nThe disciple said, \"This is a very difficult thing. If he has changed, then I will have to learn again. I will have to forget you.\"\nThe master said, \"Obviously! That is the whole purpose of exchanging disciples -- so they become flexible and more and more capable of dying to the old and always resurrecting themselves into the new.\"\nWhen the disciple arrived, he was surprised: everything had changed. And he said to his old master, \"Now it will be very difficult for me. First, I became accustomed to your old style; as I was settling you disturbed me, you sent me to another man. As I was settling there, that man threw me back to you. I was hoping deep in my heart that perhaps it won't be a difficult matter to get back into the old style I have already lived, but you have changed. You are saying things you have never said before; you are doing things you have never done before. You look almost like another person. What I am supposed to do?\"\nThe master said, \"Forget all those ... both your old master and your new master. Now you are here with me. I'm not the same man, although I look the same. So much water has gone down the Ganges ...\"\nI remember old Heraclitus, whose statement has not been taken very seriously in the Greek tradition of philosophy because he goes against the whole trend. He is unique and alone. He says, \"You cannot step in the same river twice,\" because the river is constantly flowing.\nIf I ever meet Heraclitus -- and I think I am going to meet him some day, because in this eternity people are bound to stumble again and again on the old fellows -- I am going to tell him, \"Change your statement. It was great when you made it, but it has a flaw in it. You say, 'You cannot step in the same river twice.' I want you to say, 'You cannot step in the same river even once' -- because even while you are stepping in, the river is flowing. When your foot touches the surface, the water underneath is flowing; when your foot is in the middle, the waters above and below it are flowing; when you reach the bottom, everything above it is flowing ... you cannot enter into the same river even once!\"\nAnd such is the nature of life. Everything goes on renewing itself; only mind is a dead thing, it remains the same. Hence mind has no resonance with life. If the mind is Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan it is fixed, it is a fossil, it is dead. It cannot live in the present; it is still searching for answers in the ashes of the burned bodies which do not have any life any more.\nThe golden gate is available only for those who are always alive to the new, and who are open -- and joyfully, not reluctantly -- who are happy to drop the past and remain unburdened.\nAnd the second thing Ta Hui says is that your whole life is moving towards the future, and your whole mind is moving towards the past. You are in a dichotomy; you are in a very strange conflict, as if one leg is going backwards and one leg is going forwards. You are bound to suffer immense anguish. You can neither go back, nor can you go forwards; you will remain stuck, you will become paralyzed.\nAs I see it, all fanatics are paralyzed people. They think they are believers, they think they are faithful people, but actually their psychology is paralyzed. They don't have any contact with the living sources which surround them; they are not contemporaries. It is very rare to find a contemporary. Somebody has come to a full stop one thousand years before. He is still hanging there with Hazrat Mohammed, with Jesus Christ, with Krishna, with Buddha -- and life has left all those places.\nLife is here, this very moment.\nAnd Ta Hui makes a very significant statement: THE FARTHER THEY GO, THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE -- because if you are going backwards and life is moving forwards, you will become farther and farther away from reality. THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY ... hurrying in a wrong direction is dangerous!\nI have heard ... Three professors were standing on the platform. The train was getting ready ... and they became involved in a discussion. One was to leave, two had come to give him a send-off. Suddenly the train whistled, the guard showed the flag, but they were so involved in their discussion that they did not hear anything. Just when the last compartment of the train was leaving the platform, they saw it. They all ran ... two could make it, one was left behind.\nA porter was looking at the whole thing. He came to the man and said, \"It is sad that you missed.\"\nThe professor said, \"You don't know the real story. Those two fellows had come to send me off, but in their hurry they jumped into the train going in a wrong direction!\"\nTHE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY. One has to be very clear about one's direction. The direction can be either towards the past ... that's the direction of the majority of humanity. Their golden age has passed. A small section of humanity, a minority, has its golden age in the future: the communists, the socialists, the fabians and all kinds of anarchists are hoping that the golden age is going to come in the future.\nBut the past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. One used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist.\nThe only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. That's the only right direction. Only such a man can enter into the golden gate.\nThe present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate.\nTHIS IS THE GATE OF THE GREAT DHARMA: UNCONDITIONED, UNDEFILED, WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHMENT. IF YOU AROUSE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF\nGAINING EXPERIENCE OF IT, YOU ARE RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.\nHe is making very significant statements. First, the present is the golden gate, and you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious -- no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present.\nSecondly, IF YOU AROUSE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF GAINING EXPERIENCE OF IT, YOU ARE RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. If you are thinking to\ngain experience of the present moment, you have missed the point already -- because the present moment is so small that if you start thinking of having some experience, you have got into your mind. Thinking, contemplating ... and meanwhile the present moment is slipping by.\nA man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate.\nExperience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated.\nHOW CAN YOU HOPE FOR IT, WANTING TO RELY ON SOME PETTY, CONTRIVED ACCOMPLISHMENTS?\nIT IS NOT A FORCED ACTION ... You cannot force yourself to be in the present; it comes out of understanding, not out of force. You have simply to see that the past is not there. You have simply to understand that the future has not come yet. And between these two is the small golden gate.\nEnter into it without thinking, without desiring, without having an achieving mind -- just to explore, just to see what is hidden in the present. Innocently, just like a child, enter into it.\nIT'S NOT A FORCED ACTION: THE DHARMA IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIKE THIS. DON'T TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS -- THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS PEOPLE.\nAnd the last statement is: don't start thinking of other people, and what are their accomplishments.\nA man came to Ramakrishna. He had been in the Himalayas for a long time; he heard about Ramakrishna and he came to see him. Ramakrishna was sitting under a tree by the side of the Ganges, near Calcutta, where he used to live. The man looked at Ramakrishna; he was thinking that he would be a very marvelous man -- but he was a simple villager, uneducated, very humble.\nSo the man who had been in the Himalayas practicing yoga said, \"I have come from afar and I am very disillusioned seeing you. You look to be absolutely ordinary.\"\nRamakrishna said, \"You are right. I am absolutely ordinary. How I can serve you who have come from so far?\"\nHe said, \"There is no question of service. You have so many followers -- for what reason?\nCan you walk on the water? I can.\"\nRamakrishna said, \"You are tired. Just sit a little, and then if you want to walk on the water we will enjoy it. How long did it take you to learn the art of walking on water?\"\nThe man said, \"Nearabout twenty years.\"\nRamakrishna laughed. He said, \"You wasted your life. What is the point in the first place? When I want to go to the other shore\" -- the ordinary rate in those days was two paise -- \"\nbecause I'm a poor man and people love me, they won't even take me to the other shore if I insist on giving them two paise. They refuse. They say, 'If you want to come, don't talk about money. You can come and we will feel blessed. It is enough to be with you while we are crossing the Ganges.' So something which costs only two paise ... you wasted twenty years to attain it? You surprise me.\"\nThe man at first was shocked, but then he realized that what Ramakrishna was saying was right: \"What is the point? -- I have become a showman. These twenty years ... almost one third of my life is wasted. And what is my achievement?\"\nTa Hui is saying, DO NOT TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS -- THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS PEOPLE.\nThe golden gate is open for those who are simple, who are humble, who are almost nobodies, who don't have great achievements to proclaim to the world, who don't carry awards and Nobel prizes, who have nothing to brag about ... who are just as simple as birds, as trees.\nPerhaps you have never thought about it, that the whole existence, the trees, the clouds, the mountains, the stars, are all humble. There is no arrogance anywhere. Only a man who understands the secret of being nobody can enter into the narrow gate.\nThe gate is very narrow; if you are somebody, you cannot enter into it. You have to be almost nothing, only then the gate of the present is available to you. You have to be egoless, nothing to claim, just being as ordinary as the rainwater or the silent trees, as innocent as the just-born child. He looks all around, he is conscious, but he has no claim. He is, but he has no identity. He does not say, \"I am this, I am that\"; he does not carry certificates and degrees and miraculous powers.\nIt has been one of the most significant things that although you hear the Christian missionaries and the Christian bishops talking about the miracles of Jesus, you never hear anything like that about Gautam Buddha, about Mahavira, about Ramakrishna. In fact, if you take away all the miracles of Jesus which Christians go on bragging about, which are all fictitious ... if they are all taken away, nothing will be left in Jesus.\nBut Gautam Buddha has no miracles. He has never walked on water and he has never raised anybody from the dead; he has never cured anybody from diseases, he has not turned water into wine -- he has done nothing. You cannot destroy him. His greatness is not in his actions but in his presence. His greatness is not in miracles but in his silence, in his humbleness.\nI don't think that Christ ever walked on water -- no intelligent person will do it -- but these stories are fictions created by the disciples. Not a single Jewish scripture mentions it; they don't even mention the name of Jesus. Can you think that if a man today walks on water, raises dead people, turns water into wine and things like that it would not be reported as headlines in all the newspapers of the world?\nBut not a single mention of the name of Jesus is found in any Jewish scripture. And he was a Jew, remember, he was not a Christian; he had never heard the name Christian. He was born a Jew, he lived a Jew, he died a Jew. A Jewish boy -- he was only thirty-three when he was crucified -- doing such miracles, it is inconceivable that he would not be mentioned in some chronicle by somebody. It is impossible to conceive that a Jew doing such great miracles should be crucified. And he was not saying anything against Judaism; in fact all he was claiming was, \"I'm the long-awaited Jewish messiah.\"\nGautam Buddha was criticizing everything Hindu. If Hindus had crucified him, there would seem to be some justification. But Jesus was not criticizing anything; on the contrary, he was proclaiming himself the Jewish prophet for which the Jews have been waiting since the days of Moses -- \"He will come and deliver us.\" And if this man was walking on water, raising dead people, this must have proved that he was the right messiah: what more can you expect? He must be the only son of God, because no man can walk on water.\nThe reality is that after three hundred years Christian disciples created fictitious miracles, because if these miracles are not there, then there is nothing in Jesus that can be of any importance. He is not a meditator, he has not said that he has become enlightened, he has not opened any doors of mysteries -- so fictions are needed.\nI have heard that a bishop and two rabbis had gone fishing in Lake Galilee, where Jesus used to walk. The bishop said to the rabbis, \"I'm new here, you live here. Do you think Jesus really walked on water?\"\nOne rabbi said, \"What to say about Jesus -- here almost everybody walks on water.\" The bishop said, \"What? Can you walk on water?\"\nThe rabbi said, \"Yes.\"\nThey stopped the boat. The rabbi stepped out, walked on the water a few feet, and came back. The bishop could not believe it. The bishop asked the other rabbi, \"Can you also walk ...?\"\nThe second rabbi went out of the boat a few feet on the water, came back and both the rabbis said, \"We are not Christians. You are a Christian -- can you walk on water?\"\nThe bishop said, \"Of course. If you can walk, even without being Christians, certainly I can also.\" He gathered confidence, seeing two persons walking, and he got out of the boat ... and started drowning.\nOne rabbi said to the other, \"Should we tell that idiot that on that side there are no rocks?\nThe rocks are on this side!\"\nIt is possible to walk on water if you know where the rocks are. But people become very much interested in all kinds of stupid things ...\nTa Hui is saying, \"Don't bother about what others have achieved.\" That always misleads people, because they also start trying to achieve the same marvels, the same miracles. And in existence there is no miracle.\nIn existence there are mysteries, and you can enter those mysteries, and you can enjoy and relish, and you can dance with great blissfulness. But that does not mean that you will be able to walk on water; nature does not allow exceptions. That does not mean that you will be able to turn water into wine. That is really a crime; don't do that!\nIt is enough -- perhaps the greatest miracle according to me, and Ta Hui will agree with me\n-- to be humble, just to be nobody, with no claim, silent, aware, and capable of entering the golden gate, the present moment.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6677","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part39/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">37 This moment</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6677 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part39.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part38>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

become aware of your own limitless, unbounded, oceanic consciousness. No
word is capable to describe it. You can experience it, but you cannot
explain it. You can have it, but you cannot say anything about it. Only
your silence may give a little indication of the tremendous vastness of
existence, of life, of consciousness.</p><p>Enlightenment is only an effort to make you aware of your infinity,
of your eternity. You are the whole past.</p><p>You are the whole present. You are the whole future.</p><p>The moment one comes to know it is the most blessed moment. You have
fulfilled your destiny, you have come home; now there is nothing else
beyond it. This is the only richness, this is the only victory. All else
is mundane; only this experience is the sacred.</p><p>And to be filled with this sacredness, nothing much is needed on your
part -- just a silent mind, a peaceful heart, a wordless, thoughtless
serenity. Suddenly you are no more the dewdrop; instantly you have
become the ocean itself. To know the ocean there is only one way ... to
become it.</p><p>Ta Hui is coming to the close of his journey. He started as an
intellectual, but he was a fortunate intellectual; he did not get lost
in words and theories and arguments. He managed to get beyond the mind,
and now he is making statements which belong to the beyond, which are
not arguments but only hints for those who are in search.</p><p>The whole journey of Ta Hui is significant because it is the journey
of everyone who moves from ignorance to innocence, from mind to
mindlessness, from darkness to ultimate light.</p><p>It is your journey.</p><p>Going with Ta Hui, step by step, will help you immensely, because
there is no other book that I have come across which describes the whole
transformation. All other books come after enlightenment; people have
spoken only when they have known. This is a special case. We start with
a teacher and we end up with a great master.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?

DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH IT? THEY ARE LIKE FOOLS INTENT ON GOING WEST
TO GET SOMETHING IN THE EAST -- THE FARTHER THEY GO, THE FARTHER AWAY
THEY ARE; THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY. THIS IS THE GATE

RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. HOW CAN YOU HOPE FOR IT, WANTING
TO RELY ON SOME PETTY, CONTRIVED ACCOMPLISHMENTS?</p><p>IT'S NOT A FORCED ACTION: THE DHARMA IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIKE THIS.
DON'T TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS -- THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS
PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>This morning it is raining so beautifully.</p><p>Tomorrow ... one never knows; it may be sunny, the clouds may have
disappeared.</p><p>This morning the cuckoo is continuously singing, tomorrow it may have
gone. Life is such. You cannot ask permanency, consistency, that things
should always remain the same.</p><p>Watching life you will come to know the very secret, and you will
also become aware that mind is not functioning according to life. Mind
believes in consistency; it wants that it should rain every morning,
just the same. Mind is not able to cope with the unknown, with the
spontaneous, with the ever-renewing existence.</p><p>The disparity between mind and life is the whole problem. Either you
listen to the mind ... then you live in misery, because life is not
going to fulfill the demands of the mind. Unfulfilled, miserable, your
life will become just a long drawnout tragedy. But nobody else except
you is responsible. You listened to the wrong adviser: you should have
listened to life, not to mind.</p><p>Mind is a small mechanism, good for day-to-day affairs, good for the
marketplace, but if you want to enter into the vastness of existence
mind is absolutely incapable. But you are accustomed to the mind, and
even when you are seeking for truth or for love or for the ultimate
meaning you go on carrying your old mind, which is absolutely a
hindrance; it is not a help on the way.</p><p>If you listen to life instead of mind, things are very simple. You
never say to life, "You are contradictory. Yesterday there was no rain
and today it is raining. Yesterday it was hot and today it is cold." You
simply accept life as it comes -- there is no other way. It is one of
those inescapables Ta Hui has talked of before. It is unavoidable.</p><p>The child will become a young man, the young man will become old, and
the old man will die. A man of understanding simply accepts this whole
flux, change, without any resistance, because he knows this is how
things are. By your expectations they don't change. Your expectations
only create frustrations for you.</p><p>My whole life I have been told, "You have said something a few years
before; now you are saying something else. Your philosophy is
contradictory, you are not consistent."</p><p>And they have been shocked when I told them, "Yes, you are right. But
it is not an objection against me, it is a compliment. It means my
philosophy is in tune with life. It changes ... the climate changes, the
season changes. Sometimes it is fall and the trees are standing naked;
against the sky they have their own beauty. And sometimes it is spring,
and the trees are so green with foliage and ready to shower their
flowers for anyone who happens to be nearby. No introduction is needed,
no acquaintance is needed; the friend and the foe are both treated the
same way."</p><p>From my very childhood I watched the river of my village swelling in
the rains, becoming so vast as if it is the ocean itself. In summer it
shrinks to a small stream. I have told people, "You don't ever say to
the river, 'Your behavior is very inconsistent.' You never ask the
flowers, you never ask the birds, 'Why are you not singing today? What
has happened?' But you go on asking about philosophies, ideologies,
whether they are consistent or not."</p><p>Once and for all, in a single blow, you have to drop the idea of
consistency. It is a by-product of the training of your mind. Mind
cannot be with the inconsistent -- but life is inconsistent. I am not
responsible for it, and neither are you. Nobody is responsible for it;
it simply happens to be so. And it is beautiful.</p><p>Ta Hui is making a great statement. No philosopher can make such a
statement, only a mystic who has put his mind aside and looks directly
into existence and becomes aware of its constantly changing flux. Except
for change, everything changes. The only permanent thing in the world is
change. And the moment you ask things not to change, you are creating
misery for yourself.</p><p>Ta Hui says, DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT
RIGHT.</p><p>Mysticism is not academic, it is not an ordinary school. It belongs
to the beyond, the ultimate and the mysterious. If you live with a
living master, you have to learn that. There is no need to remember what
he has said yesterday. Yesterday was yesterday; today is today.</p><p>A living master responds to reality moment to moment; he never
bothers whether it is consistent with yesterday or not. His only concern
is whether it is true to the moment or not; whether his response to the
moment is authentic or not. If it is authentic, then there is no need to
bother what he has said yesterday or the day before yesterday.</p><p>This is where the philosopher and the mystic differ. Philosophers
remain consistent; they avoid inconsistency. Their only fear is to
commit a mistake, to say something which goes against something that
they have said before. But just because of this consistency they remain
unaware of the mysteries of existence, they remain confined in their
mind. They never come to know the rain, the sun, the moon, the trees,
the children playing. This whole drama of tremendous beauty is missed by
the so-called philosophers.</p><p>But strangely enough they are the people who dominate the mind of
humanity. There is a natural reason: they can dominate the mind because
mind loves consistency and philosophers are consistent people.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying: DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER
IT</p><p>RIGHT ... The day has passed, the statement is out of date. 'Right'
belongs to the present. Never compare dead corpses with living people;
never compare flowers which have disappeared with the flowers that are
blossoming now, otherwise you will be getting into a confusion. To come
out of such a confusion is very difficult, almost impossible. It is good
to remember it from the very beginning: DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE
SAID.</p><p>Teachers go on saying to the students, "Remember what I'm saying to
you." Only a master can say to the disciples, "Forget all that I have
said to you. When it was needed, when it was a response to something
actual, it was said and you heard it, and you absorbed it. Now there is
no need to remember it. It has become part of you."</p><p>Memory never becomes part of you. That's why after the universities
your so-called gold medalists, your so-called first-class people, simply
disappear in the world; nobody ever hears about them. What happened?
They were so great in the university. They should have made a remarkable
life outside the university; they should have left a mark in the world;
they should have left their signature in life. But nobody ever hears
about them, and the reason is that in the university memory is all. They
were good at remembering.</p><p>In life just memory is of no use. In life something more and
something better -- intelligence, spontaneity, being in tune moment to
moment with all the changes that are happening -- is needed. A man who
is stuck with his memories falls far away from life. That's what happens
to your so-called scholars. They know much about scriptures, but they
know nothing about life.</p><p>DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID, AND CONSIDER IT RIGHT. TODAY I</p><p>SPEAK THIS WAY ... because today is today. It has never been before,
and it will never be again. It is absolutely new and fresh. It is not a
repetition, it is not a continuation either. Life goes on jumping from
moment to moment abruptly.</p><p>Do you see this rain? Abruptly it starts, abruptly it is gone,
abruptly it becomes intense and for no other reason becomes soft
again.</p><p>TODAY I SPEAK THIS WAY, BUT THEN TOMORROW I WILL SPEAK</p><p>OTHERWISE. Ta Hui knows one thing certainly: tomorrow is not going to
be the same. Naturally he can say with confidence, TOMORROW I WILL SPEAK
OTHERWISE ..." and if you go on collecting what I say, you will become
puzzled. You will start wondering what is right and what is wrong."</p><p>As far as the mystics are concerned, their statements are not to be
considered the way you consider the statements of philosophers. You have
to look at the mystic; his statements are</p><p>only responses to changing life. You have to see that the mystic is
always in the moment; he never looks back, he never looks ahead. Feeling
this will bring you closer to the mystic.</p><p>I have heard an ancient story ... A drunkard went in the night, after
getting completely drunk, to a sweet shop and he purchased some sweets.
He gave a ten rupee note, but the shopkeeper said "I don't have any
change. Tomorrow you can collect the remaining rupees; right now I don't
have them. Either you can keep your ten rupees and tomorrow you can pay,
or you can leave ten rupees and tomorrow you can take the remaining
part."</p><p>The drunkard said, "I am not in a fit state; I may forget those ten
rupees somewhere. You keep it. Tomorrow I will collect them."</p><p>But in his drunkenness -- confused and dismal -- still he thought, "I
should remember exactly the name of the shop, the face of the man,
exactly where the place is, because tomorrow morning I will not be drunk
and I will have to remember. I should make something special as a mark
so that this man cannot deceive me."</p><p>He looked all around. He could not see anything except a bull sitting
in front of the shop. He said, "That's right. This man could change the
sign; tomorrow his father or his brother may be sitting there and they
can simply refuse, saying, 'You never came last night' -- but they won't
think about the bull who is so silently sitting."</p><p>Happily he left, and the next morning he came to collect his money.
But the bull was sitting before a barber's saloon. The drunkard said,
"My God! Just for a few rupees you have changed the sign; you have
changed even your profession -- you have become a barber just for a few
rupees!"</p><p>The barber said, "What nonsense you are talking! I have been a barber
always."</p><p>The drunkard said, "You cannot deceive me. Look at the bull; he is
still sitting silently where I had left him last night."</p><p>The drunkard was behaving like a philosopher, finding a certain
consistency. Reality is different. The bull can change places; there is
no obligation for him to sit continuously before the sweet shop -- he
can sit anywhere. Life goes on changing.</p><p>A mystic is committed to life, not to his own statements. Those
statements are old newspapers. He remains alert moment to moment and he
remains alert to the disciple, his changes. Your questions may be the
same, but the master may answer differently because you are not the
same. And the question is not important; you are important.</p><p>AS SOON AS YOU ARE THUS, I AM NOT THUS ... Living with a master one
has to be flexible, not dogmatic. Whatever the master is saying is not
an ultimate statement -- no statement can be ultimate. So don't take it
as an ultimate answer, because tomorrow he will change and then you will
be in a difficulty.</p><p>Your mind would like to remain with the past because it has become
familiar, accustomed to the statement. Now this new statement disturbs
the mind and its constant search for consistency.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying, AS SOON AS YOU ARE THUS, I AM NOT THUS; WHEN YOU
ARE NOT THUS, THEN I AM THUS. WHERE WILL YOU SEARCH OUT MY ABIDING
PLACE? SINCE I MYSELF DON'T EVEN KNOW, HOW CAN ANYONE ELSE FIND WHERE I
STAY?</p><p>The mystic has no philosophy as such. You will be surprised to know
that in India we don't have any equivalent word for philosophy. The word
that India has used for centuries and which has now become synonymous
with philosophy is darshan.</p><p>Darshan has a totally different meaning. Darshan means clarity of
vision, ability to see; it has nothing to do with philosophy. Philosophy
literally means love of knowledge, love of wisdom. Darshan means seeing
the reality and responding accordingly. Philosophy is of the mind,
darshan is of meditation.</p><p>THIS IS THE LIVING GATE ... this understanding that life is changing,
you are changing, everything is changing. Don't cling to anything, don't
be a fanatic; don't be a fundamentalist Christian, don't be a Hindu. How
can you be a Hindu? Five thousand years ago your scriptures were
written; in five thousand years the bull has moved! Bulls are not
predictable, they are very free, beautiful animals. And you are still
holding the dead scripture, and thinking you are a Hindu, you are a
Mohammedan, you are a Christian, you are a Communist.</p><p>Belonging to the past -- even the closest past, yesterday -- is a
wrong approach. Not to belong to anything but to remain available to
whatever life brings to you -- this is the living gate. Then every
moment is an excitement and every moment is a discovery and every moment
is a challenge. Every moment you have to grow because you have to learn
to respond in a way you have never responded. You become mature.</p><p>All fanatics, fundamentalists, fascists remain retarded. They are
living in the past, which is no more. They are completely blind as far
as the reality is concerned. They go on seeing things which have
disappeared from the scene, and they are incapable ... they really avoid
seeing what has become real.</p><p>YOU CAN ENTER ONLY WHEN YOU'VE PUT TO DEATH YOUR FABRICATED</p><p>"REALITY." Unless you learn the art of dying every moment to the
past, you are not really living. The past goes on becoming heavier and
heavier, because the past is growing every day. And your future is so
fragile, so small, that the past does not allow you to live in the
present. It pulls you backwards.</p><p>It is as if you, being a fundamentalist, go on insisting, "I will
continue to use my underwear from my childhood." You will be a
phenomenon ...!</p><p>I have heard about a man who had ordered a tailor to make a beautiful
suit for him. He was going to a marriage celebration in a few days, "so
make it really beautiful." The suit was made, the man tried it and he
could not believe it: one arm of the coat was long, the other arm was
short; one leg of the suit was long, another was short. He said, "What
kind of thing have you made?"</p><p>The tailor said, "Nothing is wrong with it. The arm of the coat which
is short ... you just pull your hand inside!"</p><p>He said, "This is a difficult job, continuously to keep the hand
pulled inside. And what about the other hand?"</p><p>The tailor said, "You put your hand outside, and you have to do the
same with your legs."</p><p>You can conceive ... and the tailor said, "It is such a beautiful
suit. I have worked day and night over it, and you complain about small
things!"</p><p>So the poor fellow went out. A couple came by and the woman said,
"Look at that poor fellow. He seems to be paralyzed or crippled. What
has happened to him? One arm is short, one arm is long, and the way he
is walking ...!"</p><p>But the man said, "Forget about him, look at the suit; it is really
beautiful. And what can the tailor do? -- if the man is like that, the
tailor has done the best he could do."</p><p>Almost everybody in the world -- the Christian, the Hindu, the Jaina,
the Buddhist, the Mohammedan, the Jew -- they are all wearing coats and
suffering immensely. One hand has to be kept pulled in, another has to
be kept pulled out. Man is not important, but doctrines, philosophies,
ideologies are important. They are not for man, but man is for them; he
has to fit accordingly.</p><p>Every idea that comes from the past is crippling your consciousness.
You have to learn the art of dying to everything that has passed, so
that you can live in the present with totality, with no burden. And when
the present moves, you also move, because now the present is becoming
past -- die to it.</p><p>Always remember that the fresh, the present has to be totally lived,
and anything that hinders has to be dropped. Don't bother about being
consistent; otherwise to be consistent you will have to wear for your
whole life the underwear that you happened to wear in childhood. Then
you cannot be inconsistent; you have to be consistent, however you
suffer -- and you are going to suffer. Your whole life will be destroyed
by underwear that is to small. You cannot walk, you cannot sit, you
cannot talk; you have always to consider the underwear. But everybody is
in the same psychological position.</p><p>Ta Hui's golden gate is certainly a golden gate. YOU CAN ENTER ONLY
WHEN YOU'VE PUT TO DEATH YOUR FABRICATED "REALITY." YET STUDENTS
CONSIDER PAYING HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA, UPHOLDING THE SCRIPTURES, AND
DISCIPLINING THEMSELVES IN BODY, MOUTH, AND MIND, AS THEIR SUSTENANCE,
HOPING TO FIND REALIZATION. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH IT? THEY ARE
LIKE FOOLS INTENT ON GOING WEST TO GET SOMETHING IN THE EAST -- THE
FARTHER THEY GO, THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE; THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE
GREATER THE DELAY.</p><p>A few things that he has said ... First, remain fresh and clean; go
on dropping the dust that naturally gathers as time passes by.</p><p>One Zen master, Rinzai, was sent by his own master to another master.
This has been a tradition in Zen, that sometimes masters sent their
disciples to different masters just so that they don't become accustomed
to a certain way, a certain style; they don't become fixed, they remain
flexible. Naturally a different master will have a different style --
and Zen masters are very unique people.</p><p>The disciple went to the other master, and he was very much puzzled.
What he heard there was almost in contradiction to what he had been
hearing from his own master. He asked the new master, "What am I to do?
I have come from a master -- he has sent me -- and I have become
accustomed to a certain way of life, a certain way of thinking, and here
things are totally different."</p><p>The master said, "Forget your old master and forget all that you have
learned there. One of the greatest principles of learning is the art of
forgetting. You have heard that learning is the</p><p>art of remembering, but you can remember the new only if you forget
the old. So forget the old! While you are here, be here!"</p><p>After a year or two he became accustomed to the new master, and as he
was becoming more and more familiar, relaxed, and the conflict was
disappearing, the master said, "Now you go back to your old master."</p><p>The disciple said, "This is a strange thing. It took me two years to
forget that fellow, and now to go back again ..."</p><p>The master said, "You will not find the same fellow, because in two
years he must have changed."</p><p>The disciple said, "This is a very difficult thing. If he has
changed, then I will have to learn again. I will have to forget
you."</p><p>The master said, "Obviously! That is the whole purpose of exchanging
disciples -- so they become flexible and more and more capable of dying
to the old and always resurrecting themselves into the new."</p><p>When the disciple arrived, he was surprised: everything had changed.
And he said to his old master, "Now it will be very difficult for me.
First, I became accustomed to your old style; as I was settling you
disturbed me, you sent me to another man. As I was settling there, that
man threw me back to you. I was hoping deep in my heart that perhaps it
won't be a difficult matter to get back into the old style I have
already lived, but you have changed. You are saying things you have
never said before; you are doing things you have never done before. You
look almost like another person. What I am supposed to do?"</p><p>The master said, "Forget all those ... both your old master and your
new master. Now you are here with me. I'm not the same man, although I
look the same. So much water has gone down the Ganges ..."</p><p>I remember old Heraclitus, whose statement has not been taken very
seriously in the Greek tradition of philosophy because he goes against
the whole trend. He is unique and alone. He says, "You cannot step in
the same river twice," because the river is constantly flowing.</p><p>If I ever meet Heraclitus -- and I think I am going to meet him some
day, because in this eternity people are bound to stumble again and
again on the old fellows -- I am going to tell him, "Change your
statement. It was great when you made it, but it has a flaw in it. You
say, 'You cannot step in the same river twice.' I want you to say, 'You
cannot step in the same river even once' -- because even while you are
stepping in, the river is flowing. When your foot touches the surface,
the water underneath is flowing; when your foot is in the middle, the
waters above and below it are flowing; when you reach the bottom,
everything above it is flowing ... you cannot enter into the same river
even once!"</p><p>And such is the nature of life. Everything goes on renewing itself;
only mind is a dead thing, it remains the same. Hence mind has no
resonance with life. If the mind is Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan it
is fixed, it is a fossil, it is dead. It cannot live in the present; it
is still searching for answers in the ashes of the burned bodies which
do not have any life any more.</p><p>The golden gate is available only for those who are always alive to
the new, and who are open -- and joyfully, not reluctantly -- who are
happy to drop the past and remain unburdened.</p><p>And the second thing Ta Hui says is that your whole life is moving
towards the future, and your whole mind is moving towards the past. You
are in a dichotomy; you are in a very strange conflict, as if one leg is
going backwards and one leg is going forwards. You are bound to suffer
immense anguish. You can neither go back, nor can you go forwards; you
will remain stuck, you will become paralyzed.</p><p>As I see it, all fanatics are paralyzed people. They think they are
believers, they think they are faithful people, but actually their
psychology is paralyzed. They don't have any contact with the living
sources which surround them; they are not contemporaries. It is very
rare to find a contemporary. Somebody has come to a full stop one
thousand years before. He is still hanging there with Hazrat Mohammed,
with Jesus Christ, with Krishna, with Buddha -- and life has left all
those places.</p><p>Life is here, this very moment.</p><p>And Ta Hui makes a very significant statement: THE FARTHER THEY GO,
THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE -- because if you are going backwards and life
is moving forwards, you will become farther and farther away from
reality. THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY ... hurrying in a
wrong direction is dangerous!</p><p>I have heard ... Three professors were standing on the platform. The
train was getting ready ... and they became involved in a discussion.
One was to leave, two had come to give him a send-off. Suddenly the
train whistled, the guard showed the flag, but they were so involved in
their discussion that they did not hear anything. Just when the last
compartment of the train was leaving the platform, they saw it. They all
ran ... two could make it, one was left behind.</p><p>A porter was looking at the whole thing. He came to the man and said,
"It is sad that you missed."</p><p>The professor said, "You don't know the real story. Those two fellows
had come to send me off, but in their hurry they jumped into the train
going in a wrong direction!"</p><p>THE GREATER THE HURRY, THE GREATER THE DELAY. One has to be very
clear about one's direction. The direction can be either towards the
past ... that's the direction of the majority of humanity. Their golden
age has passed. A small section of humanity, a minority, has its golden
age in the future: the communists, the socialists, the fabians and all
kinds of anarchists are hoping that the golden age is going to come in
the future.</p><p>But the past is no more and the future is not yet: both are
unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. One used to exist,
but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist.</p><p>The only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow
is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is,
his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of
here and in the reality of now. That's the only right direction. Only
such a man can enter into the golden gate.</p><p>The present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate.</p><p>THIS IS THE GATE OF THE GREAT DHARMA: UNCONDITIONED, UNDEFILED,
WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHMENT. IF YOU AROUSE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF</p><p>GAINING EXPERIENCE OF IT, YOU ARE RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION.</p><p>He is making very significant statements. First, the present is the
golden gate, and you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious
-- no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even
enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a
non-ambitious man can remain in the present.</p><p>Secondly, IF YOU AROUSE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF GAINING EXPERIENCE OF
IT, YOU ARE RUNNING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. If you are thinking
to</p><p>gain experience of the present moment, you have missed the point
already -- because the present moment is so small that if you start
thinking of having some experience, you have got into your mind.
Thinking, contemplating ... and meanwhile the present moment is slipping
by.</p><p>A man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to
see and enter the gate.</p><p>Experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated.</p><p>HOW CAN YOU HOPE FOR IT, WANTING TO RELY ON SOME PETTY, CONTRIVED
ACCOMPLISHMENTS?</p><p>IT IS NOT A FORCED ACTION ... You cannot force yourself to be in the
present; it comes out of understanding, not out of force. You have
simply to see that the past is not there. You have simply to understand
that the future has not come yet. And between these two is the small
golden gate.</p><p>Enter into it without thinking, without desiring, without having an
achieving mind -- just to explore, just to see what is hidden in the
present. Innocently, just like a child, enter into it.</p><p>IT'S NOT A FORCED ACTION: THE DHARMA IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIKE THIS.
DON'T TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS -- THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS
PEOPLE.</p><p>And the last statement is: don't start thinking of other people, and
what are their accomplishments.</p><p>A man came to Ramakrishna. He had been in the Himalayas for a long
time; he heard about Ramakrishna and he came to see him. Ramakrishna was
sitting under a tree by the side of the Ganges, near Calcutta, where he
used to live. The man looked at Ramakrishna; he was thinking that he
would be a very marvelous man -- but he was a simple villager,
uneducated, very humble.</p><p>So the man who had been in the Himalayas practicing yoga said, "I
have come from afar and I am very disillusioned seeing you. You look to
be absolutely ordinary."</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "You are right. I am absolutely ordinary. How I can
serve you who have come from so far?"</p><p>He said, "There is no question of service. You have so many followers
-- for what reason?</p><p>Can you walk on the water? I can."</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "You are tired. Just sit a little, and then if you
want to walk on the water we will enjoy it. How long did it take you to
learn the art of walking on water?"</p><p>The man said, "Nearabout twenty years."</p><p>Ramakrishna laughed. He said, "You wasted your life. What is the
point in the first place? When I want to go to the other shore" -- the
ordinary rate in those days was two paise -- "</p><p>because I'm a poor man and people love me, they won't even take me to
the other shore if I insist on giving them two paise. They refuse. They
say, 'If you want to come, don't talk about money. You can come and we
will feel blessed. It is enough to be with you while we are crossing the
Ganges.' So something which costs only two paise ... you wasted twenty
years to attain it? You surprise me."</p><p>The man at first was shocked, but then he realized that what
Ramakrishna was saying was right: "What is the point? -- I have become a
showman. These twenty years ... almost one third of my life is wasted.
And what is my achievement?"</p><p>Ta Hui is saying, DO NOT TAKE A LIKING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S MARVELS --
THE MARVELOUS MISLEADS PEOPLE.</p><p>The golden gate is open for those who are simple, who are humble, who
are almost nobodies, who don't have great achievements to proclaim to
the world, who don't carry awards and Nobel prizes, who have nothing to
brag about ... who are just as simple as birds, as trees.</p><p>Perhaps you have never thought about it, that the whole existence,
the trees, the clouds, the mountains, the stars, are all humble. There
is no arrogance anywhere. Only a man who understands the secret of being
nobody can enter into the narrow gate.</p><p>The gate is very narrow; if you are somebody, you cannot enter into
it. You have to be almost nothing, only then the gate of the present is
available to you. You have to be egoless, nothing to claim, just being
as ordinary as the rainwater or the silent trees, as innocent as the
just-born child. He looks all around, he is conscious, but he has no
claim. He is, but he has no identity. He does not say, "I am this, I am
that"; he does not carry certificates and degrees and miraculous
powers.</p><p>It has been one of the most significant things that although you hear
the Christian missionaries and the Christian bishops talking about the
miracles of Jesus, you never hear anything like that about Gautam
Buddha, about Mahavira, about Ramakrishna. In fact, if you take away all
the miracles of Jesus which Christians go on bragging about, which are
all fictitious ... if they are all taken away, nothing will be left in
Jesus.</p><p>But Gautam Buddha has no miracles. He has never walked on water and
he has never raised anybody from the dead; he has never cured anybody
from diseases, he has not turned water into wine -- he has done nothing.
You cannot destroy him. His greatness is not in his actions but in his
presence. His greatness is not in miracles but in his silence, in his
humbleness.</p><p>I don't think that Christ ever walked on water -- no intelligent
person will do it -- but these stories are fictions created by the
disciples. Not a single Jewish scripture mentions it; they don't even
mention the name of Jesus. Can you think that if a man today walks on
water, raises dead people, turns water into wine and things like that it
would not be reported as headlines in all the newspapers of the
world?</p><p>But not a single mention of the name of Jesus is found in any Jewish
scripture. And he was a Jew, remember, he was not a Christian; he had
never heard the name Christian. He was born a Jew, he lived a Jew, he
died a Jew. A Jewish boy -- he was only thirty-three when he was
crucified -- doing such miracles, it is inconceivable that he would not
be mentioned in some chronicle by somebody. It is impossible to conceive
that a Jew doing such great miracles should be crucified. And he was not
saying anything against Judaism; in fact all he was claiming was, "I'm
the long-awaited Jewish messiah."</p><p>Gautam Buddha was criticizing everything Hindu. If Hindus had
crucified him, there would seem to be some justification. But Jesus was
not criticizing anything; on the contrary, he was proclaiming himself
the Jewish prophet for which the Jews have been waiting since the days
of Moses -- "He will come and deliver us." And if this man was walking
on water, raising dead people, this must have proved that he was the
right messiah: what more can you expect? He must be the only son of God,
because no man can walk on water.</p><p>The reality is that after three hundred years Christian disciples
created fictitious miracles, because if these miracles are not there,
then there is nothing in Jesus that can be of any importance. He is not
a meditator, he has not said that he has become enlightened, he has not
opened any doors of mysteries -- so fictions are needed.</p><p>I have heard that a bishop and two rabbis had gone fishing in Lake
Galilee, where Jesus used to walk. The bishop said to the rabbis, "I'm
new here, you live here. Do you think Jesus really walked on water?"</p><p>One rabbi said, "What to say about Jesus -- here almost everybody
walks on water." The bishop said, "What? Can you walk on water?"</p><p>The rabbi said, "Yes."</p><p>They stopped the boat. The rabbi stepped out, walked on the water a
few feet, and came back. The bishop could not believe it. The bishop
asked the other rabbi, "Can you also walk ...?"</p><p>The second rabbi went out of the boat a few feet on the water, came
back and both the rabbis said, "We are not Christians. You are a
Christian -- can you walk on water?"</p><p>The bishop said, "Of course. If you can walk, even without being
Christians, certainly I can also." He gathered confidence, seeing two
persons walking, and he got out of the boat ... and started
drowning.</p><p>One rabbi said to the other, "Should we tell that idiot that on that
side there are no rocks?</p><p>The rocks are on this side!"</p><p>It is possible to walk on water if you know where the rocks are. But
people become very much interested in all kinds of stupid things ...</p><p>Ta Hui is saying, "Don't bother about what others have achieved."
That always misleads people, because they also start trying to achieve
the same marvels, the same miracles. And in existence there is no
miracle.</p><p>In existence there are mysteries, and you can enter those mysteries,
and you can enjoy and relish, and you can dance with great blissfulness.
But that does not mean that you will be able to walk on water; nature
does not allow exceptions. That does not mean that you will be able to
turn water into wine. That is really a crime; don't do that!</p><p>It is enough -- perhaps the greatest miracle according to me, and Ta
Hui will agree with me</p><p>-- to be humble, just to be nobody, with no claim, silent, aware, and
capable of entering the golden gate, the present moment.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part38>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

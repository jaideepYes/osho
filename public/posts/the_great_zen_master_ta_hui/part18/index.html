I could have been the greatest master in the whole of Tibet.\" So he said, \"That's very good. You have got the right secret.\" And he told all the disciples, \"This is what trust is.\"\nAnd he tried to walk on water himself. When his name is enough ... of course, for him, walking on water would not be a problem. But just as he took a step he started drowning. Marpa had to jump in and pull him out.\nAnd the teacher said, \"This is strange -- that my name is working and I myself am drowning.\"\nMarpa said, \"You have destroyed everything. Now your name will not work. It was not your name -- it was my trust. And now seeing you drowning, how can I trust in your name? You have destroyed my innocence. I had come here to learn to be more trusting, to be more innocent. Rather than being a help, you have almost destroyed all my hope.\"\nBut Marpa became a great master. His teacher's name is not known. Marpa managed to transform the whole of Tibet to the path of the Buddha.\nSo sometimes it has happened that the teacher may not know, but if the disciple trusts, his trust can create miracles. Buddha has said, \"Let people read the scriptures, let them listen to teachers ... the teachers may not know that the scriptures are dead words; but who knows, if these people have trust, their trust can resurrect the dead words. Their trust can get inspiration from people who don't have anything that can inspire.\nFinally it is trust in yourself, but it takes a little time to find the trust in yourself. It is easy to trust in somebody else. But once you have understood that it is trust -- then why trust in individuals? Why not trust in the whole existence? Then your whole life becomes a mystery, and things start happening around you which you are not doing.\nSomething has happened, because Ta Hui has changed his tone. He has stopped quoting others. For the first time he is saying things on his own authority, and things of tremendous importance: be aware of yourself, who you are. And the right moment to be aware is when your mind for some reason gets baffled, cannot function, and a window opens and you can see yourself.\nOnce you have seen yourself you can never be caught in the snares of the mind. Once you have seen yourself -- even just a glimpse -- the true pilgrimage has begun.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n16\nBefore seeking\n22 July 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, BEFORE SEEKING\nYOU'VE INDICATED YOU WANT ME TO INSTRUCT YOU BY LETTER IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS. THIS VERY THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS HAS ALREADY STUCK YOUR HEAD INTO A BOWL OF GLUE. THOUGH I SHOULDN'T ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF FROST TO THE SNOW, NEVERTHELESS WHERE THERE'S A QUESTION IT SHOULDN'T GO UNANSWERED. I ASK YOU TO ABANDON AT ONCE ALL THE JOY YOU'VE EVER FELT IN READING THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES YOURSELF OR WHEN BEING AROUSED AND INSTRUCTED BY OTHERS.\nBE TOTALLY WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING, AS BEFORE, LIKE A THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD. THOUGH THE INNATE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THERE, IT DOESN'T OPERATE. THEN CONTEMPLATE WHAT'S THERE BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS ARISES: OBSERVE AND OBSERVE. AS YOU FEEL YOU'RE LOSING YOUR GRIP MORE AND MORE AND YOUR HEART IS MORE AND MORE UNEASY, DON'T GIVE UP AND SLACK OFF: THIS IS THE PLACE TO CUT OFF THE HEADS OF THE THOUSAND SAGES. STUDENTS OF THE PATH OFTEN RETREAT AT THIS POINT. IF YOUR FAITH IS THOROUGHGOING, JUST KEEP CONTEMPLATING WHAT'S BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS ARISES. SUDDENLY YOU WILL AWAKEN FROM YOUR DREAM, AND THERE WON'T BE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT IT.\nTa Hui is saying a few significant things. The first is that the consciousness of a three-year-old child, a baby, is there, but it does not create thinking. It remains just like a mirror, reflecting everything around the child, but the child does not start thinking whether something is good or bad, beautiful or ugly.\nWhy three years are mentioned is significant to understand: if you try to go backwards in your memory, you will stop at the age of three. You cannot go beyond that. The reason is that only after three years of age do thoughts start stirring the consciousness and impressions start collecting in the memory.\nUp to the age of three the child is exactly like a sage, only with one difference: this innocence is natural and is bound to be lost, because the child is not aware of its beauty, its richness, its splendor.\nHe does not know how much valuable treasure he is going to lose as soon as he starts thinking. In fact he wants to think as quickly as possible, because he is seeing people all around him who can think better, who are more articulate, achieve to higher positions, greater\nprestige, more honor. This whole world supports the process of thinking. For any ambition to be achieved, thinking is absolutely essential.\nThe moment the child becomes aware of the fact that thinking is the most essential thing to being someone in the world, somebody special with name and fame, then he starts learning as quickly as possible and transforming his consciousness and its energy into thoughts, into memory, into imagination -- not knowing that he is losing his most precious nature, his most precious meditative consciousness.\nIt is true, just as Jesus says: Unless you are born again you will not attain the kingdom of God. He does not mean that first you have to die and be born again; he is only using a metaphor. You have to die as a thinker, as a mind, and you have to be reborn only as an innocent consciousness, just like a child.\nOnce a man has completed the whole circle from childhood to the enlightened man, he comes to the same self-nature, only with one difference: the child was not aware of it, and the enlightened person is nothing but awareness. He recognizes the value, he enjoys the tremendous bliss of it; his is the ecstasy of the ultimate and the eternal.\nThe child was just innocent in a negative sense -- he was innocent because he was ignorant\n-- and the sage is innocent because he is wise. All ignorance has been dispelled.\nThe child's innocence was not meditative; it was simply non-functioning consciousness; it was just waiting for the right time and age to start functioning. Perhaps the reason is ... all the animals in the world are born complete; only man's child is born incomplete. Hence man's child is more dependent and helpless than any animal in the world.\nAn animal's children can survive without the family, without the mother, without the father; they will find some way. But it is impossible to think that man's child can find some way to survive on his own.\nThe reason is very strange; perhaps you have never thought about it. The reason is that man's child is born incomplete. He has to be born incomplete because the mother cannot carry the child for three years more; that would mean for four years continuously ... Nine months is the ultimate for the mother to carry the child; more than that it is impossible, her womb has not the capacity.\nSo every child is born three years before he should have been born. Those three years he is out of the womb, but almost totally dependent on the mother, on the father, on the family -- now this is the womb around him. After three years he starts taking a few steps outside the circle of the womb, the family, and for the first time he starts showing indications of being an individual.\nBelow the age of three, children are almost always referring to themselves in the third person: \"The baby is hungry\"; \"The baby wants to sleep\"; \"The baby is thirsty.\" They don't say, \"I am thirsty\"; the \"I\" has not formed yet. The \"I\" will need a little time, because it is nothing but the center of the mind. The body is formed; the mind is still in the process of forming. It takes three years for the mind to come to a point from where it starts functioning as an individual.\nSo the body is born when the child has been nine months in the mother's womb, and the mind is born when the child has been three years out of the womb. That's why we cannot remember further backwards than the age of three. There, suddenly a China wall ...\nThose three years we have lived, and in those three years a thousand and one things must have happened. But they have not left any impact, any footprints on our memory system; the memory system was not ready. The child has every capacity to function as an individual; he just needs a little time for the whole mechanism to be ready to function.\nThe sage has lived as a mind, suffered as a mind, has gone through the whole hell of the mind, and has learned the lesson that unless you go beyond the mind life is going to remain a continuous agony.\nMind is agony.\nOnce this experience settles deeply in you, out of your own experience arises a new effort, a new beginning, a new birth ... the birth of meditation. Just as at the age of nine months the body is born, at the age of three the mind is born. Somewhere -- it depends how intelligently you are watching your experiences, how you are looking at the sources of your misery and suffering -- if you are intelligent enough, perhaps by the age of thirty-five you may start feeling a deep urge to go beyond the mind.\nThe seven years between thirty-five and forty-two prepare you to take the quantum leap. If everything goes naturally, unobstructed and unhindered by the society, by organized religions, then the age of forty-two will be the third birth, the birth of meditation, a new beginning beyond mind.\nIt does not happen to everyone at forty-two, because no society wants it to happen. It is the most dangerous thing as far as the society is concerned, that people should start going beyond the mind, because going beyond the mind means going beyond the social order, going beyond the organized church, going beyond the scriptures, going beyond all vested interests, going beyond slavery, going beyond any kind of exploitation, oppression, and attaining to your dignity as an authentic consciousness.\nThis consciousness cannot be imprisoned, it cannot be killed, it cannot be burned. Even nuclear weapons are absolutely impotent as far as this consciousness is concerned.\nNo society wants individuals so powerful in themselves. Every society wants you to remain dependent on it.\nYour independence is being curtailed in every possible way. And because your independence, your individuality is being curtailed, death comes before meditation comes. Life has been a wastage. Unless you attain to meditation, you have not really lived.\nI have heard about a man who only became aware that he was alive when he died. Suddenly an awakening ... \"My God, I have been alive, but now it is too late.\" Perhaps this may be true not just about one man -- it may be true about every man who has died without meditation. Dead people don't tell stories; just this one man was an exception. There are a few exceptional men in the world always.\nWhile you are alive you are not really conscious how precious life is. In fact it is one of the tricks of the mind: whatever you have, you don't recognize its value unless you lose it.\nThere was a great king who had conquered many lands and had accumulated immense wealth, but was very unhappy and miserable. There was not a single moment of joy, bliss ... He started asking people, \"What is the purpose of all my wealth and all my kingdom? I cannot even sleep. My mind is so full of tensions, worries, there is no space for anything else. Is there someone in my kingdom who can help me?\"\nPeople had heard about a Sufi mystic and they said, \"In your kingdom there is a Sufi mystic, a very strange fellow. He has helped many people, although you have to be a little alert with him because he is not predictable, he may do anything. But one thing is certain: whatever he does, finally you find that it had a reason. In the beginning it will look absolutely irrational. If you have courage enough you can go.\"\nThe king said, \"Do you think me a coward? I have invaded great lands; my whole life has been the life of a warrior. Can a poor Sufi mystic make me afraid? I will go ... and I will go alone, no bodyguards, no army, no advisers.\"\nBut he took with him a big bag full of diamonds and rubies and emeralds, just to show to the Sufi mystic: \"This is only a sample. I have so much money but it is not helping me at all. First I used to think that when I have money I will relax and enjoy. But now money is there and I'm living in hell.\"\nThe Sufi mystic was sitting under a tree. The king went there, got down from his horse, touched the feet of the Sufi mystic and asked him, \"Can you help me?\"\nThe Sufi mystic said, \"What do you want? I will help you immediately.\"\nHe had heard that this man was strange -- otherwise nobody would tell you, \"I will help you immediately.\" He is going to do something ... The king was a little afraid: nobody wants to be helped immediately. He said, \"There is no hurry, but ...\"\nThe Sufi mystic said, \"Just tell me what you want. Don't waste my time. You say it; I will give it to you and be finished.\"\nThe king said, \"You don't understand. I want peace of mind.\"\nAnd when he was saying \"peace of mind,\" the Sufi mystic took his bag of emeralds and diamonds and rubies and ran away. The king said, \"My God, what kind of man is he? Is he a mystic or a thief?\"\nHe ran -- in his whole life he had never run. The village was unknown to him, with small streets. The Sufi was perfectly well known; he lived in that village. The king was shouting, \"Catch hold of that thief\" -- and people were laughing, because people knew that every day something or other happens. And it was really a laughing matter: the king was huffing and puffing and shouting, \"Catch him! Why are you just laughing?\" -- and still running because that old fellow is taking away all his money and he is going so fast.\nThe Sufi mystic gave him a good round of the whole village, made the whole village aware that the mystic is ahead and the king is following, perspiring. Finally he reached to the same tree, sat there, and waited for the king to come. The king came very tired, perspiring, and the mystic gave him the bag. He took the bag, put it on his chest and said, \"My God!\"\nThe Sufi said, \"Have you got some peace of mind? Had not I told you I would help you immediately?\"\nThe king said, \"Strange is your way ... but it is true, I am feeling very peaceful, as I have never felt in my life. And the trouble is that this money was always with me, and I never felt so happy as I am feeling now.\"\nThe Sufi said, \"I have solved your problem. Your problem is that you have got everything. You need some distance, you need to lose it; only then will you understand what you had. And this is not only true about your money. This is more true about your life itself: because you\nhave it, you have started taking it for granted. It is too obvious it is yours. You are not at all concerned that tomorrow it may not be yours, or even the next second.\"\nThe day you become aware that death will destroy all opportunities for growth ... Life is a great opportunity to grow, but rather than growing you have been simply accumulating junk which will all be taken away. People only grow old, but growing old is not growing up.\nVery few people grow up.\nGrowing old is a natural thing; every animal does it, there is nothing special about it. It is horizontal. Growing up is vertical. Only very few people grow up; and meditation is the only path that moves vertically. Mind moves horizontally.\nTa Hui is making a few very important statements.\nThe first thing, the first sutra: YOU'VE INDICATED YOU WANT ME TO INSTRUCT YOU BY LETTER IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS. THIS VERY THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS HAS ALREADY STUCK YOUR HEAD INTO A BOWL OF GLUE.\nIt seems he is getting free from his own intellectual jargon. He is becoming aware of something more than the mind. He is condemning the very idea of getting instruction through somebody else, and that too through a letter, through words, through language. First from somebody else, second through language ...\nTHOUGH I SHOULDN'T ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF FROST TO THE SNOW ...\nbecause whatever I say will become more knowledge to you, it will simply strengthen the power of your mind. What is needed is to weaken the power of the mind so that you can go beyond it without being hindered by it.\nThis has been the problem of all the enlightened people. Ta Hui is right when he says, NEVERTHELESS WHERE THERE'S A QUESTION IT SHOULD NOT GO UNANSWERED.\nWhy should it not go unanswered? Because every question, if answered by somebody who is not just knowledgeable, can be turned into a quest. The right answer does not mean what it means in schools and colleges and universities; the right answer is that which turns your question into a quest. The right answer does not mean the answer that is given in the books and you are repeating it just like a parrot.\nAs far as the enlightened man is concerned the right answer has nothing to do with your question. He simply uses your energy involved in the question and turns it into a quest; it becomes your thirst.\nThat's why Ta Hui is right when he says, WHERE THERE IS A QUESTION IT SHOULD NOT GO UNANSWERED.\nThe opportunity should not be missed to change the question into a quest. Your answer has to be such that the question is not solved but rather deepens into a quest; it becomes less intellectual and more existential. A question about water should be turned by your answer into a deep thirst.\nAll the awakened people down the ages have been answering only for this purpose, not that they are giving you the right answers -- there are no right answers. Your questions are being used to provoke in you a search, a deep longing. If the answer can do that, it is the right answer.\nI ASK YOU TO ABANDON AT ONCE ALL THE JOY YOU'VE EVER FELT IN READING THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES YOURSELF OR WHEN BEING AROUSED AND INSTRUCTED BY OTHERS.\nHe is turning towards his own being. He is not using quotations anymore. He is saying things which just a few sutras before he himself was doing; now he is saying things against them. He is saying, I ASK YOU TO ABANDON AT ONCE ALL THE JOY YOU'VE EVER FELT IN READING THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES YOURSELF OR WHEN BEING AROUSED AND INSTRUCTED BY OTHERS.\nWhy have the awakened people always been against scriptures? This is a great misunderstanding all around the world. The people who have awakened are against the scriptures for a totally different reason than people understand. People think they are against scriptures because scriptures are wrong; they are against scriptures because if you get lost in the words of scriptures you will never come to know your own truth. The scriptures may be right, that is not the point. Perhaps they are right -- but they are not right for you; they were right only for those people who had experienced and have expressed something out of their experience.\nBut to you they are just dead words, and if you become too much interested in collecting dead corpses around yourself you will soon be drowned in the dead words. That's what happens to all the scholars: their great effort simply becomes a suicide. They work hard, but their gain is nothing.\nScriptures may have come from people who were awakened, but the moment somebody says ... It is no more the same as his own experience. And when it is written it goes even further away. That's why no enlightened person in the whole world has written anything by his own hand; they have spoken -- because the spoken word and the written word have qualitative differences.\nThe spoken word has a warmth; the written word is absolutely cold, ice cold. The spoken word has the heartbeat of the master. The spoken word is not just a word -- it is still breathing when it reaches you, it has still some flavor. It is coming from a source of immense joy and light; it is bound to carry something of that fragrance, some radiation from that light, some vibe which may not be visible but will stir your being.\nTo listen to a master is one thing, and to read just the same words is totally different, because the living presence of the master is no more behind the words. You can't see those eyes, you can't see those gestures, you can't see in those words the same authority ... you can't feel those same silent gaps.\nThe presence of the master, his charisma, his energy is missing in the written word. The written word is absolutely dead. No master has ever written except Lao Tzu -- and that too under imperial pressure.\nHis whole life he refused to write, and in the end he was going to leave China and go towards the Himalayas for his ultimate rest. The emperor of China ordered the armies on the boundary, \"If Lao Tzu passes through that area\" -- because that was the only gate towards the Himalayas, he was bound to pass by there -- \"imprison him. Take good care of him, but make it clear to him he cannot go out of China unless he writes his experiences. This is an order from the emperor.\"\nPoor Lao Tzu was not aware what was going on. He simply went to the place where it was easiest to move out of China. There was an army waiting, and he was caught immediately. Respectfully, with great honor, they told him, \"This is the imperial order. Forgive us, we don't want to hinder you, but just to fulfill the order -- otherwise we will not be able to allow you to go out of China. And we have made a special guesthouse for you with every comfort, luxury, according to the orders from the emperor. You stay and you write whatever you have experienced, what the truth is that you have realized which has attracted so many people.\"\nBecause he wanted to reach quickly to the Himalayas -- his death was coming closer and he wanted to die in the Himalayas ... The Himalayas have an eternal silence, a peace that you cannot find anywhere else. Under such circumstances he wrote TAO TE CHING, a small booklet.\nThat is the only exception in the whole history when an enlightened man has written anything. But the beginning of the book says, \"Truth cannot be written. So remember, whatever I am writing is not truth. I will try my best to be as close to truth as possible, but approximate truth is not truth.\" So he has begun his book with the statement, \"Whatever is written goes far away from the living experience.\" That is the reason why all the awakened people have been against scriptures.\nBut the ordinary masses have always misunderstood them. If I say anything against the VEDAS, Hindus are angry; if I say anything against THE BIBLE, Christians are angry.\nBut I am not against the VEDAS or against THE BIBLE; I am against your being lost in those dead words. Once they were alive, but now the people whose presence was needed to give them life, to keep their flame burning, themselves have disappeared into the universal consciousness. Just their footprints are left on the sand of time. You can call them holy footprints, but that does not make any sense. You can worship them, you can have photographs of them, you can hang those photographs. You can do all kinds of stupid things, which are being done in all churches, all mosques, all temples, all synagogues.\nThe man who knows has to say something against all that is going on. Ta Hui is right when he says, \"Stop having any joy in scriptures; that is dangerous, it is poisonous.\"\nBE TOTALLY WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING, AS BEFORE, LIKE A THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD. THOUGH THE INNATE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THERE, IT DOES NOT OPERATE.\nBe born again as a child. The greatest achievement in life is if in your old age you can again become a child. You have completed the circle, you have come back home, you have rediscovered your self-nature. Every child comes with it, but first he has to lose it. Only then will he recognize what he has lost in gaining money, power, respectability, which are of no use at all. He has lost himself, he has sold himself in the marketplace for a few pieces of gold.\nIf one recognizes this, one stops accumulating knowledge and starts dropping all so-called knowledge. A simple criterion has to be used: whatever is not your experience is not true. It may be the experience of Gautam Buddha, it may be the experience of Jesus, it may be the experience of Lao Tzu -- but it is not your experience.\nWhen a Buddha eats, his hunger disappears, not your hunger. If Buddha finds the truth, his darkness disappears, not your darkness. Nobody can help anybody else.\nI don't think of it as a calamity; I think of it as one of the greatest privileges of man: at least in this world there is one thing which is absolutely yours -- neither can anybody give it to\nyou nor can anybody take it away from you. It cannot be stolen, there is no way to destroy it ... but you have to find it yourself. There is no shortcut to it and there is no cheap way to find it.\nYou will have to go into your own aloneness, into your own subjectivity, into the very center of your being where nothing moves and everything is absolutely still. In that stillness you will find again your lost childhood. And to find it again is such a celebration, every cell of your being starts dancing.\nTa Hui is saying, \"If you can reach to the same state of consciousness when it was there but not operating\" ... THEN CONTEMPLATE WHAT IS THERE BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS ARISES: OBSERVE AND OBSERVE.\nHe is giving you an essential method of meditation. Any thought arising in your mind ... rather than finding out the answer, try to find out from where it arises and what was the situation of your inner being when it had not arisen.\nYou will suddenly find again and again the same innocence, the same childhood consciousness, the same golden period. Every thought, if you observe, will lead you to the same state. Then thought is not your enemy, then mind is not your enemy; on the contrary, it becomes an object of observation.\nOBSERVE AND OBSERVE. Just watch. A thought arises and a thought disappears. It arises from nowhere. Before it arises there is absolute silence, and then it disappears into silence again, into nothingness. In the beginning is nothingness, in the end is nothingness ... and this nothingness is your pure consciousness.\nTHE BIBLE says, \"In the beginning there was the word. And God was with the word, and God was the word.\"\nIt is possible that in the beginning there was sound -- but not word, because 'word' means a meaningful sound. Who will give meaning to it?\nAnd in fact, if you look scientifically, when you go into the forest and you hear the sound of running water in a waterfall, there is no meaning in it, but there is sound. You will be surprised to know the scientific understanding: the sound is there only because you are there; without your ears there is no sound.\nSo it will be very surprising to you: when there is nobody around the waterfall, there is no sound, because sound needs ears. In the same way, there is light here -- the moment we all are gone there is no light, because the light needs eyes. Without eyes there is no light.\nWhen you move out of your room do you think things remain the same? -- the blue remains blue and the red remains red? Just forget all that nonsense. The moment you go out of the room all the colors disappear -- it is a very magical world -- you close the room and all colors are gone, because colors need eyes. Without an eye no color can exist. And just look through the keyhole ... they come back.\nThis miracle is happening every day. In fact, even if you are sitting in your room and you close your eyes, all the colors disappear. Don't try just to see from the corner of your eye whether they have disappeared or they are still there -- they will come back immediately!\nTo say that in the beginning there was the word is absolutely wrong. Sound would have been better, but that too is not right. Silence would be even better than sound, but silence also needs ears, just as sound needs ears. Do you think when you are absent from your room there\nis silence? It is not possible. There is no noise, that is true, but there is no silence either. Noise and silence both are experiences of the ears.\nSo what was in the beginning?\nNo silence ... no sound ... no word.\nGautam Buddha and his approach seem to be far more scientific: there was only nothingness. That nothingness is our very being. We have come out of that nothingness and we will disappear into that nothingness one day.\nSo make friends with that nothingness, because it is going to be your eternal home. To make friends with nothingness is all that is meant by meditation. And as you observe your thoughts, slowly, slowly they disappear, and only a pure nothingness surrounds you. You have come to the beginning of the world, which is also the end of the world. You have come to the source and you have come to the goal.\nIn this state only your awareness is the truth. That's why Buddha and all those people who have awakened to the ultimate truth don't recognize the hypothesis of God. In that nothingness they don't find any God, unless you want to call nothingness \"God.\" Then there is no problem\n-- but it will give a very wrong understanding about nothingness.\nI myself have come to the conclusion that rather than saying, \"There was no God\" -- because it will unnecessarily hurt people and will not help in any way -- it is better to say, \"There was godliness.\" Just a quality ... That nothingness was not empty; that nothingness was full, overfull. It was full of consciousness, and consciousness is the divine quality; you can call it godliness.\nAnd the whole of existence is made of the same stuff. You can call it nothingness, you can call it godliness -- it is only a question of whether you prefer a negative description or a positive description, but both the words mean the same thing.\nAS YOU FEEL, says Ta Hui, YOU'RE LOSING YOUR GRIP MORE AND MORE AND\nYOUR HEART IS MORE AND MORE UNEASY ... When you observe your thoughts and this nothingness starts surrounding you, there is always a possibility that your heart will start sinking. You may become afraid, scared.\nDon't be scared and don't be uneasy. It is happening only because of your old habit. You have never experienced nothingness, otherwise there is nothing more blissful, there is nothing more peaceful, there is nothing more alive.\n... DON'T GIVE UP AND SLACK OFF: THIS IS THE PLACE TO CUT OFF THE\nHEADS OF THE THOUSAND SAGES. This refers to a certain statement of Gautam Buddha. He used to say to his disciples, \"If I meet you on the way, don't hesitate -- immediately cut my head. Most probably I will meet you\" -- because the disciples have loved him so much and the master has showered so much love on them that when they become silent there is every possibility the mind will play its last trick. The last trick will be to bring the master himself ... and that will become the barrier to seeing the nothingness.\nGautam Buddha is absolutely right: \"Cut my head immediately -- because I am not there, just mind is playing the last game, the last resort.\"\nIt happened in Ramakrishna's life ... He was a worshiper of mother-goddess Kali, and he came in contact with an enlightened wandering monk, Totapuri. Totapuri said to him,\n\"Although you have progressed so much, you are stuck. You are stuck with this goddess ... because there is no goddess, nothing; it is just your imagination.\"\nRamakrishna was already worshiped by thousands of people, but when Totapuri said this to him he immediately recognized that the man was right. He said to Totapuri, \"Help me -- because when I close my eyes everything else disappears. Only the mother-goddess remains, so beautiful, so radiant that I forget completely that I have to enter into nothingness. She is so beautiful and so charming that I get lost into her beauty and into her energy. And when I wake up I cry, because I wanted to go beyond her but she seems to surround me like a boundary, like a jail, from everywhere.\"\nTotapuri said, \"You sit before me, and just look at this piece of glass.\" Ramakrishna said, \"What is the purpose of that piece of glass?\"\nTotapuri said, \"I will watch your face, because I know -- I have watched you: when you see the mother-goddess inside yourself your face becomes so beautiful, so graceful that I will know immediately that you have come to encounter your illusion that you have been conditioning yourself with for years. I will immediately cut just on your forehead with this piece of glass, and as I cut and blood starts flowing, you also take courage and cut the head of the mother-goddess.\"\nRamakrishna said, \"It is very difficult. And moreover from where am I going to get the sword?\"\nTotapuri laughed and he said, \"If you can imagine the mother-goddess, can't you imagine a sword? It is all imagination. And if you miss, I am not going to stay here anymore. So don't miss this chance, otherwise in this life perhaps you will not meet another Totapuri.\"\nRamakrishna closed his eyes and as he became radiant, joyful and his face started showing that he was seeing something tremendously beautiful, Totapuri cut exactly what in the East is called the third eye. From the top of his forehead he went down to his nose, cutting the skin. Blood was flowing and Ramakrishna gathered courage, pulled out his sword -- he could not believe from where this sword had come -- and he cut the head of the mother-goddess. It was very difficult because he had loved this mother for years. He had been dancing and singing, chanting; he was creating the illusion -- otherwise there are no mother-goddesses, no father-gods, except in man's imagination, except in man's childish fixation on mothers and fathers.\nHe cut the head and he could not believe it: the mother fell in two parts, the head on this side and the body on that side. And it was as if a door opened -- a door to nothingness, to infinity ... for six days he remained in that state.\nAfter six days he opened his eyes -- there were tears in his eyes -- and the first words he spoke to Totapuri were, \"The last barrier has fallen. I am grateful to you. You have shown tremendous compassion.\"\nThat was the last day. After that he never went into the temple of the mother-goddess; after that he never mentioned the name of the mother-goddess. And after that he was a totally different man -- so silent, so peaceful, so joyous, as if there was not a single worry in the world.\nHe lived almost three years after this experience, and those three years were his most precious years. People who have sat by his side -- and he was not very ancient, he existed just\nin the last century, in the last years of the past century. So just a hundred years ago he was here, and I have come across people in Bengal whose grandfathers sat with Ramakrishna, and they still remember their grandfathers telling them about the man.\nThose three years he was not speaking ... Once in a while he would tell a small story, once in a while he would dance, but otherwise he would sit silently with hundreds of disciples, all enjoying and sharing the ultimate nothingness.\nSTUDENTS OF THE PATH OFTEN RETREAT AT THIS POINT. Those who are\nbeginners are naturally afraid when they come across nothingness. Naturally the fear arises as if they are drowning, as if this nothingness is going to swallow them. It is true: it will swallow ... but only that which you are not. Only your false personality will disappear; just your authentic being will remain in its crystal-clear purity.\nThere is no need to fear. The master is needed at such stages. This is the last stage where the master is needed -- not to let you retreat, but to give you a good push, just a little encouragement: \"Don't be worried, I have also been through the same stage; there is nothing to be feared. It is not death. This nothingness is not death; this nothingness is purest life.\"\nIF YOUR FAITH IS THOROUGHGOING, JUST KEEP CONTEMPLATING WHAT'S BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS ARISES. SUDDENLY YOU WILL AWAKEN FROM YOUR DREAM, AND THERE WON'T BE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT IT.\nAllow this nothingness to take possession of you ... and all your dreams disappear; your sleep, your spiritual sleep cannot remain anymore.\nI have to explain something to you at this point. For thousands of years it has been thought that dreams are a kind of disturbance to sleep, but the latest findings say just the opposite. Dreams are not a disturbance to your sleep, they are very protective and helpful to your sleep. They prevent your sleep from being broken.\nFor example, you feel hungry and you are asleep, and a dream arises that you are going into the kitchen and you are opening the fridge, and you are taking a good share of sweets or ice cream or whatsoever you like -- because in a dream there is no question, whatsoever you like ... The dream is very generous -- and as much you like, because dreams don't listen to doctors.\nThis way the dream has protected your sleep, otherwise the hunger would have disturbed you. Now you feel you have taken enough and the sleep continues.\nRecent research about dream and sleep have made many things clear. Out of eight hours you would not think that you are dreaming almost six hours; for only two hours are you asleep, and even that is not in a single piece for two hours -- a few minutes here, a few minutes there ... In six hours of dreams, for just a few fragments here and there are you asleep.\nThere has been an experiment done in many psychological labs. A person was disturbed whenever he was dreaming. It is very easy to know when a person is dreaming: if you are sitting by the side of your wife or your husband or your friend, the moment you see his eyes start moving under the eyelids he is starting to dream. So it is very easy to know when he is dreaming and when he is not dreaming, because when he dreams then naturally he is seeing scenes, almost like a film, and his eyes start moving. When he is simply asleep his eyes don't move.\nExperiments have been done: whenever a person would dream, they would wake him up, they would disturb his dream. They would allow him to sleep, but they would not allow him to dream. And they were surprised that although he had slept two, three hours -- which was the most that he would sleep -- he was very tired, exhausted, he was not rejuvenated; in the morning he did not feel like getting up. They could not believe it; they were thinking that although his dreams were being disturbed, his sleep would be complete. The old idea had been that it is the sleep that rejuvenates you, revitalizes you.\nThen they did another experiment. They would disturb the person when he was asleep, they would not let him sleep; he could dream as much as he wanted -- his dreaming time they would leave undisturbed. And the strange finding was that in the morning the man was more fresh than he had ever been. He had not slept at all; the whole night he had been in a movie house, and he was not tired.\nSo two things have become clear: one, that dreams are not disturbing the sleep but are protecting and guarding it; second, dreams are more necessary for your health than your sleep, because dreams are throwing out all the garbage that you collect the whole day. They clean your whole being -- six hours spring-cleaning -- so in the morning you feel fresh.\nWhy am I telling you about this experiment? Because the same applies to the spiritual sleep. The moment your dreams disappear in meditation -- thoughts, images; these are all dreams -- when they all disappear, then your spiritual sleep cannot remain; your dreams were protecting it. So just as on the ordinary mental level it is true, it is true on the spiritual level too, exactly in the same way. Once dreams have disappeared, that means meditation has come to maturity.\nAnd after the dreams are gone, suddenly you will feel a new awakening. You have been waking up every morning, but once you wake up from your spiritual sleep, then you will see the difference, and why in the East we have been dividing sleep into four stages. The first stage is so-called waking; the second stage is dreaming; the third stage, sleep, and the fourth stage, real awakening.\nThe so-called waking we all know; every morning we wake up. The enlightened being knows the real awakening. It has some quality of our awakening, but our awakening is very small, a very thin layer.\nThe awakening of a Gautam Buddha is total. In that total awakening there is a luminous awareness surrounded by a positive nothingness. It is not empty, it is overfull. Rather than say nothingness, Gautam Buddha used to say \"no-thingness.\" Things have disappeared ... and what has remained is inexpressible. We try to express it as blissfulness, as ecstasy, as eternal joy, but these are faraway echoes of the real thing. They don't represent it exactly -- there is no way.\nIn our language we cannot translate the experience of the ultimate awakening, but a few hints can be given.\nTa Hui's suggestions to the young seeker are all significant: FAITH IS THOROUGHGOING ... It has to be thoroughgoing, but one has to remember it is not the faith in a church, it is not the faith in a holy scripture; it is simply faith in yourself.\nThe function of the master is not to create faith in him, but to create faith in yourself. An authentic master makes you more and more trusting in your own individuality, in your own\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7579","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16 Before seeking</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7579 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

name can do such miracles I must be a fool that I have never tried doing
miracles myself. I could have been the greatest master in the whole of
Tibet." So he said, "That's very good. You have got the right secret."
And he told all the disciples, "This is what trust is."</p><p>And he tried to walk on water himself. When his name is enough ... of
course, for him, walking on water would not be a problem. But just as he
took a step he started drowning. Marpa had to jump in and pull him
out.</p><p>And the teacher said, "This is strange -- that my name is working and
I myself am drowning."</p><p>Marpa said, "You have destroyed everything. Now your name will not
work. It was not your name -- it was my trust. And now seeing you
drowning, how can I trust in your name? You have destroyed my innocence.
I had come here to learn to be more trusting, to be more innocent.
Rather than being a help, you have almost destroyed all my hope."</p><p>But Marpa became a great master. His teacher's name is not known.
Marpa managed to transform the whole of Tibet to the path of the
Buddha.</p><p>So sometimes it has happened that the teacher may not know, but if
the disciple trusts, his trust can create miracles. Buddha has said,
"Let people read the scriptures, let them listen to teachers ... the
teachers may not know that the scriptures are dead words; but who knows,
if these people have trust, their trust can resurrect the dead words.
Their trust can get inspiration from people who don't have anything that
can inspire.</p><p>Finally it is trust in yourself, but it takes a little time to find
the trust in yourself. It is easy to trust in somebody else. But once
you have understood that it is trust -- then why trust in individuals?
Why not trust in the whole existence? Then your whole life becomes a
mystery, and things start happening around you which you are not
doing.</p><p>Something has happened, because Ta Hui has changed his tone. He has
stopped quoting others. For the first time he is saying things on his
own authority, and things of tremendous importance: be aware of
yourself, who you are. And the right moment to be aware is when your
mind for some reason gets baffled, cannot function, and a window opens
and you can see yourself.</p><p>Once you have seen yourself you can never be caught in the snares of
the mind. Once you have seen yourself -- even just a glimpse -- the true
pilgrimage has begun.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>16</p><p>Before seeking</p><p>22 July 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, BEFORE SEEKING</p><p>YOU'VE INDICATED YOU WANT ME TO INSTRUCT YOU BY LETTER IN THE DIRECT

POINT. IF YOUR FAITH IS THOROUGHGOING, JUST KEEP CONTEMPLATING WHAT'S
BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS
ARISES. SUDDENLY YOU WILL AWAKEN FROM YOUR DREAM, AND THERE WON'T BE ANY
MISTAKE ABOUT IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Ta Hui is saying a few significant things. The first is that the
consciousness of a three-year-old child, a baby, is there, but it does
not create thinking. It remains just like a mirror, reflecting
everything around the child, but the child does not start thinking
whether something is good or bad, beautiful or ugly.</p><p>Why three years are mentioned is significant to understand: if you
try to go backwards in your memory, you will stop at the age of three.
You cannot go beyond that. The reason is that only after three years of
age do thoughts start stirring the consciousness and impressions start
collecting in the memory.</p><p>Up to the age of three the child is exactly like a sage, only with
one difference: this innocence is natural and is bound to be lost,
because the child is not aware of its beauty, its richness, its
splendor.</p><p>He does not know how much valuable treasure he is going to lose as
soon as he starts thinking. In fact he wants to think as quickly as
possible, because he is seeing people all around him who can think
better, who are more articulate, achieve to higher positions,
greater</p><p>prestige, more honor. This whole world supports the process of
thinking. For any ambition to be achieved, thinking is absolutely
essential.</p><p>The moment the child becomes aware of the fact that thinking is the
most essential thing to being someone in the world, somebody special
with name and fame, then he starts learning as quickly as possible and
transforming his consciousness and its energy into thoughts, into
memory, into imagination -- not knowing that he is losing his most
precious nature, his most precious meditative consciousness.</p><p>It is true, just as Jesus says: Unless you are born again you will
not attain the kingdom of God. He does not mean that first you have to
die and be born again; he is only using a metaphor. You have to die as a
thinker, as a mind, and you have to be reborn only as an innocent
consciousness, just like a child.</p><p>Once a man has completed the whole circle from childhood to the
enlightened man, he comes to the same self-nature, only with one
difference: the child was not aware of it, and the enlightened person is
nothing but awareness. He recognizes the value, he enjoys the tremendous
bliss of it; his is the ecstasy of the ultimate and the eternal.</p><p>The child was just innocent in a negative sense -- he was innocent
because he was ignorant</p><p>-- and the sage is innocent because he is wise. All ignorance has
been dispelled.</p><p>The child's innocence was not meditative; it was simply
non-functioning consciousness; it was just waiting for the right time
and age to start functioning. Perhaps the reason is ... all the animals
in the world are born complete; only man's child is born incomplete.
Hence man's child is more dependent and helpless than any animal in the
world.</p><p>An animal's children can survive without the family, without the
mother, without the father; they will find some way. But it is
impossible to think that man's child can find some way to survive on his
own.</p><p>The reason is very strange; perhaps you have never thought about it.
The reason is that man's child is born incomplete. He has to be born
incomplete because the mother cannot carry the child for three years
more; that would mean for four years continuously ... Nine months is the
ultimate for the mother to carry the child; more than that it is
impossible, her womb has not the capacity.</p><p>So every child is born three years before he should have been born.
Those three years he is out of the womb, but almost totally dependent on
the mother, on the father, on the family -- now this is the womb around
him. After three years he starts taking a few steps outside the circle
of the womb, the family, and for the first time he starts showing
indications of being an individual.</p><p>Below the age of three, children are almost always referring to
themselves in the third person: "The baby is hungry"; "The baby wants to
sleep"; "The baby is thirsty." They don't say, "I am thirsty"; the "I"
has not formed yet. The "I" will need a little time, because it is
nothing but the center of the mind. The body is formed; the mind is
still in the process of forming. It takes three years for the mind to
come to a point from where it starts functioning as an individual.</p><p>So the body is born when the child has been nine months in the
mother's womb, and the mind is born when the child has been three years
out of the womb. That's why we cannot remember further backwards than
the age of three. There, suddenly a China wall ...</p><p>Those three years we have lived, and in those three years a thousand
and one things must have happened. But they have not left any impact,
any footprints on our memory system; the memory system was not ready.
The child has every capacity to function as an individual; he just needs
a little time for the whole mechanism to be ready to function.</p><p>The sage has lived as a mind, suffered as a mind, has gone through
the whole hell of the mind, and has learned the lesson that unless you
go beyond the mind life is going to remain a continuous agony.</p><p>Mind is agony.</p><p>Once this experience settles deeply in you, out of your own
experience arises a new effort, a new beginning, a new birth ... the
birth of meditation. Just as at the age of nine months the body is born,
at the age of three the mind is born. Somewhere -- it depends how
intelligently you are watching your experiences, how you are looking at
the sources of your misery and suffering -- if you are intelligent
enough, perhaps by the age of thirty-five you may start feeling a deep
urge to go beyond the mind.</p><p>The seven years between thirty-five and forty-two prepare you to take
the quantum leap. If everything goes naturally, unobstructed and
unhindered by the society, by organized religions, then the age of
forty-two will be the third birth, the birth of meditation, a new
beginning beyond mind.</p><p>It does not happen to everyone at forty-two, because no society wants
it to happen. It is the most dangerous thing as far as the society is
concerned, that people should start going beyond the mind, because going
beyond the mind means going beyond the social order, going beyond the
organized church, going beyond the scriptures, going beyond all vested
interests, going beyond slavery, going beyond any kind of exploitation,
oppression, and attaining to your dignity as an authentic
consciousness.</p><p>This consciousness cannot be imprisoned, it cannot be killed, it
cannot be burned. Even nuclear weapons are absolutely impotent as far as
this consciousness is concerned.</p><p>No society wants individuals so powerful in themselves. Every society
wants you to remain dependent on it.</p><p>Your independence is being curtailed in every possible way. And
because your independence, your individuality is being curtailed, death
comes before meditation comes. Life has been a wastage. Unless you
attain to meditation, you have not really lived.</p><p>I have heard about a man who only became aware that he was alive when
he died. Suddenly an awakening ... "My God, I have been alive, but now
it is too late." Perhaps this may be true not just about one man -- it
may be true about every man who has died without meditation. Dead people
don't tell stories; just this one man was an exception. There are a few
exceptional men in the world always.</p><p>While you are alive you are not really conscious how precious life
is. In fact it is one of the tricks of the mind: whatever you have, you
don't recognize its value unless you lose it.</p><p>There was a great king who had conquered many lands and had
accumulated immense wealth, but was very unhappy and miserable. There
was not a single moment of joy, bliss ... He started asking people,
"What is the purpose of all my wealth and all my kingdom? I cannot even
sleep. My mind is so full of tensions, worries, there is no space for
anything else. Is there someone in my kingdom who can help me?"</p><p>People had heard about a Sufi mystic and they said, "In your kingdom
there is a Sufi mystic, a very strange fellow. He has helped many
people, although you have to be a little alert with him because he is
not predictable, he may do anything. But one thing is certain: whatever
he does, finally you find that it had a reason. In the beginning it will
look absolutely irrational. If you have courage enough you can go."</p><p>The king said, "Do you think me a coward? I have invaded great lands;
my whole life has been the life of a warrior. Can a poor Sufi mystic
make me afraid? I will go ... and I will go alone, no bodyguards, no
army, no advisers."</p><p>But he took with him a big bag full of diamonds and rubies and
emeralds, just to show to the Sufi mystic: "This is only a sample. I
have so much money but it is not helping me at all. First I used to
think that when I have money I will relax and enjoy. But now money is
there and I'm living in hell."</p><p>The Sufi mystic was sitting under a tree. The king went there, got
down from his horse, touched the feet of the Sufi mystic and asked him,
"Can you help me?"</p><p>The Sufi mystic said, "What do you want? I will help you
immediately."</p><p>He had heard that this man was strange -- otherwise nobody would tell
you, "I will help you immediately." He is going to do something ... The
king was a little afraid: nobody wants to be helped immediately. He
said, "There is no hurry, but ..."</p><p>The Sufi mystic said, "Just tell me what you want. Don't waste my
time. You say it; I will give it to you and be finished."</p><p>The king said, "You don't understand. I want peace of mind."</p><p>And when he was saying "peace of mind," the Sufi mystic took his bag
of emeralds and diamonds and rubies and ran away. The king said, "My
God, what kind of man is he? Is he a mystic or a thief?"</p><p>He ran -- in his whole life he had never run. The village was unknown
to him, with small streets. The Sufi was perfectly well known; he lived
in that village. The king was shouting, "Catch hold of that thief" --
and people were laughing, because people knew that every day something
or other happens. And it was really a laughing matter: the king was
huffing and puffing and shouting, "Catch him! Why are you just
laughing?" -- and still running because that old fellow is taking away
all his money and he is going so fast.</p><p>The Sufi mystic gave him a good round of the whole village, made the
whole village aware that the mystic is ahead and the king is following,
perspiring. Finally he reached to the same tree, sat there, and waited
for the king to come. The king came very tired, perspiring, and the
mystic gave him the bag. He took the bag, put it on his chest and said,
"My God!"</p><p>The Sufi said, "Have you got some peace of mind? Had not I told you I
would help you immediately?"</p><p>The king said, "Strange is your way ... but it is true, I am feeling
very peaceful, as I have never felt in my life. And the trouble is that
this money was always with me, and I never felt so happy as I am feeling
now."</p><p>The Sufi said, "I have solved your problem. Your problem is that you
have got everything. You need some distance, you need to lose it; only
then will you understand what you had. And this is not only true about
your money. This is more true about your life itself: because you</p><p>have it, you have started taking it for granted. It is too obvious it
is yours. You are not at all concerned that tomorrow it may not be
yours, or even the next second."</p><p>The day you become aware that death will destroy all opportunities
for growth ... Life is a great opportunity to grow, but rather than
growing you have been simply accumulating junk which will all be taken
away. People only grow old, but growing old is not growing up.</p><p>Very few people grow up.</p><p>Growing old is a natural thing; every animal does it, there is
nothing special about it. It is horizontal. Growing up is vertical. Only
very few people grow up; and meditation is the only path that moves
vertically. Mind moves horizontally.</p><p>Ta Hui is making a few very important statements.</p><p>The first thing, the first sutra: YOU'VE INDICATED YOU WANT ME TO
INSTRUCT YOU BY LETTER IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS. THIS VERY THOUGHT OF
SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS HAS ALREADY STUCK YOUR HEAD
INTO A BOWL OF GLUE.</p><p>It seems he is getting free from his own intellectual jargon. He is
becoming aware of something more than the mind. He is condemning the
very idea of getting instruction through somebody else, and that too
through a letter, through words, through language. First from somebody
else, second through language ...</p><p>THOUGH I SHOULDN'T ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF FROST TO THE SNOW ...</p><p>because whatever I say will become more knowledge to you, it will
simply strengthen the power of your mind. What is needed is to weaken
the power of the mind so that you can go beyond it without being
hindered by it.</p><p>This has been the problem of all the enlightened people. Ta Hui is
right when he says, NEVERTHELESS WHERE THERE'S A QUESTION IT SHOULD NOT
GO UNANSWERED.</p><p>Why should it not go unanswered? Because every question, if answered
by somebody who is not just knowledgeable, can be turned into a quest.
The right answer does not mean what it means in schools and colleges and
universities; the right answer is that which turns your question into a
quest. The right answer does not mean the answer that is given in the
books and you are repeating it just like a parrot.</p><p>As far as the enlightened man is concerned the right answer has
nothing to do with your question. He simply uses your energy involved in
the question and turns it into a quest; it becomes your thirst.</p><p>That's why Ta Hui is right when he says, WHERE THERE IS A QUESTION IT
SHOULD NOT GO UNANSWERED.</p><p>The opportunity should not be missed to change the question into a
quest. Your answer has to be such that the question is not solved but
rather deepens into a quest; it becomes less intellectual and more
existential. A question about water should be turned by your answer into
a deep thirst.</p><p>All the awakened people down the ages have been answering only for
this purpose, not that they are giving you the right answers -- there
are no right answers. Your questions are being used to provoke in you a
search, a deep longing. If the answer can do that, it is the right
answer.</p><p>I ASK YOU TO ABANDON AT ONCE ALL THE JOY YOU'VE EVER FELT IN READING
THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES YOURSELF OR WHEN BEING AROUSED AND
INSTRUCTED BY OTHERS.</p><p>He is turning towards his own being. He is not using quotations
anymore. He is saying things which just a few sutras before he himself
was doing; now he is saying things against them. He is saying, I ASK YOU
TO ABANDON AT ONCE ALL THE JOY YOU'VE EVER FELT IN READING THE WORDS OF
THE SCRIPTURES YOURSELF OR WHEN BEING AROUSED AND INSTRUCTED BY
OTHERS.</p><p>Why have the awakened people always been against scriptures? This is
a great misunderstanding all around the world. The people who have
awakened are against the scriptures for a totally different reason than
people understand. People think they are against scriptures because
scriptures are wrong; they are against scriptures because if you get
lost in the words of scriptures you will never come to know your own
truth. The scriptures may be right, that is not the point. Perhaps they
are right -- but they are not right for you; they were right only for
those people who had experienced and have expressed something out of
their experience.</p><p>But to you they are just dead words, and if you become too much
interested in collecting dead corpses around yourself you will soon be
drowned in the dead words. That's what happens to all the scholars:
their great effort simply becomes a suicide. They work hard, but their
gain is nothing.</p><p>Scriptures may have come from people who were awakened, but the
moment somebody says ... It is no more the same as his own experience.
And when it is written it goes even further away. That's why no
enlightened person in the whole world has written anything by his own
hand; they have spoken -- because the spoken word and the written word
have qualitative differences.</p><p>The spoken word has a warmth; the written word is absolutely cold,
ice cold. The spoken word has the heartbeat of the master. The spoken
word is not just a word -- it is still breathing when it reaches you, it
has still some flavor. It is coming from a source of immense joy and
light; it is bound to carry something of that fragrance, some radiation
from that light, some vibe which may not be visible but will stir your
being.</p><p>To listen to a master is one thing, and to read just the same words
is totally different, because the living presence of the master is no
more behind the words. You can't see those eyes, you can't see those
gestures, you can't see in those words the same authority ... you can't
feel those same silent gaps.</p><p>The presence of the master, his charisma, his energy is missing in
the written word. The written word is absolutely dead. No master has
ever written except Lao Tzu -- and that too under imperial pressure.</p><p>His whole life he refused to write, and in the end he was going to
leave China and go towards the Himalayas for his ultimate rest. The
emperor of China ordered the armies on the boundary, "If Lao Tzu passes
through that area" -- because that was the only gate towards the
Himalayas, he was bound to pass by there -- "imprison him. Take good
care of him, but make it clear to him he cannot go out of China unless
he writes his experiences. This is an order from the emperor."</p><p>Poor Lao Tzu was not aware what was going on. He simply went to the
place where it was easiest to move out of China. There was an army
waiting, and he was caught immediately. Respectfully, with great honor,
they told him, "This is the imperial order. Forgive us, we don't want to
hinder you, but just to fulfill the order -- otherwise we will not be
able to allow you to go out of China. And we have made a special
guesthouse for you with every comfort, luxury, according to the orders
from the emperor. You stay and you write whatever you have experienced,
what the truth is that you have realized which has attracted so many
people."</p><p>Because he wanted to reach quickly to the Himalayas -- his death was
coming closer and he wanted to die in the Himalayas ... The Himalayas
have an eternal silence, a peace that you cannot find anywhere else.
Under such circumstances he wrote TAO TE CHING, a small booklet.</p><p>That is the only exception in the whole history when an enlightened
man has written anything. But the beginning of the book says, "Truth
cannot be written. So remember, whatever I am writing is not truth. I
will try my best to be as close to truth as possible, but approximate
truth is not truth." So he has begun his book with the statement,
"Whatever is written goes far away from the living experience." That is
the reason why all the awakened people have been against scriptures.</p><p>But the ordinary masses have always misunderstood them. If I say
anything against the VEDAS, Hindus are angry; if I say anything against
THE BIBLE, Christians are angry.</p><p>But I am not against the VEDAS or against THE BIBLE; I am against
your being lost in those dead words. Once they were alive, but now the
people whose presence was needed to give them life, to keep their flame
burning, themselves have disappeared into the universal consciousness.
Just their footprints are left on the sand of time. You can call them
holy footprints, but that does not make any sense. You can worship them,
you can have photographs of them, you can hang those photographs. You
can do all kinds of stupid things, which are being done in all churches,
all mosques, all temples, all synagogues.</p><p>The man who knows has to say something against all that is going on.
Ta Hui is right when he says, "Stop having any joy in scriptures; that
is dangerous, it is poisonous."</p><p>BE TOTALLY WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING, AS BEFORE, LIKE A
THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD. THOUGH THE INNATE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THERE, IT DOES
NOT OPERATE.</p><p>Be born again as a child. The greatest achievement in life is if in
your old age you can again become a child. You have completed the
circle, you have come back home, you have rediscovered your self-nature.
Every child comes with it, but first he has to lose it. Only then will
he recognize what he has lost in gaining money, power, respectability,
which are of no use at all. He has lost himself, he has sold himself in
the marketplace for a few pieces of gold.</p><p>If one recognizes this, one stops accumulating knowledge and starts
dropping all so-called knowledge. A simple criterion has to be used:
whatever is not your experience is not true. It may be the experience of
Gautam Buddha, it may be the experience of Jesus, it may be the
experience of Lao Tzu -- but it is not your experience.</p><p>When a Buddha eats, his hunger disappears, not your hunger. If Buddha
finds the truth, his darkness disappears, not your darkness. Nobody can
help anybody else.</p><p>I don't think of it as a calamity; I think of it as one of the
greatest privileges of man: at least in this world there is one thing
which is absolutely yours -- neither can anybody give it to</p><p>you nor can anybody take it away from you. It cannot be stolen, there
is no way to destroy it ... but you have to find it yourself. There is
no shortcut to it and there is no cheap way to find it.</p><p>You will have to go into your own aloneness, into your own
subjectivity, into the very center of your being where nothing moves and
everything is absolutely still. In that stillness you will find again
your lost childhood. And to find it again is such a celebration, every
cell of your being starts dancing.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying, "If you can reach to the same state of
consciousness when it was there but not operating" ... THEN CONTEMPLATE
WHAT IS THERE BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS
ARISES: OBSERVE AND OBSERVE.</p><p>He is giving you an essential method of meditation. Any thought
arising in your mind ... rather than finding out the answer, try to find
out from where it arises and what was the situation of your inner being
when it had not arisen.</p><p>You will suddenly find again and again the same innocence, the same
childhood consciousness, the same golden period. Every thought, if you
observe, will lead you to the same state. Then thought is not your
enemy, then mind is not your enemy; on the contrary, it becomes an
object of observation.</p><p>OBSERVE AND OBSERVE. Just watch. A thought arises and a thought
disappears. It arises from nowhere. Before it arises there is absolute
silence, and then it disappears into silence again, into nothingness. In
the beginning is nothingness, in the end is nothingness ... and this
nothingness is your pure consciousness.</p><p>THE BIBLE says, "In the beginning there was the word. And God was
with the word, and God was the word."</p><p>It is possible that in the beginning there was sound -- but not word,
because 'word' means a meaningful sound. Who will give meaning to
it?</p><p>And in fact, if you look scientifically, when you go into the forest
and you hear the sound of running water in a waterfall, there is no
meaning in it, but there is sound. You will be surprised to know the
scientific understanding: the sound is there only because you are there;
without your ears there is no sound.</p><p>So it will be very surprising to you: when there is nobody around the
waterfall, there is no sound, because sound needs ears. In the same way,
there is light here -- the moment we all are gone there is no light,
because the light needs eyes. Without eyes there is no light.</p><p>When you move out of your room do you think things remain the same?
-- the blue remains blue and the red remains red? Just forget all that
nonsense. The moment you go out of the room all the colors disappear --
it is a very magical world -- you close the room and all colors are
gone, because colors need eyes. Without an eye no color can exist. And
just look through the keyhole ... they come back.</p><p>This miracle is happening every day. In fact, even if you are sitting
in your room and you close your eyes, all the colors disappear. Don't
try just to see from the corner of your eye whether they have
disappeared or they are still there -- they will come back
immediately!</p><p>To say that in the beginning there was the word is absolutely wrong.
Sound would have been better, but that too is not right. Silence would
be even better than sound, but silence also needs ears, just as sound
needs ears. Do you think when you are absent from your room there</p><p>is silence? It is not possible. There is no noise, that is true, but
there is no silence either. Noise and silence both are experiences of
the ears.</p><p>So what was in the beginning?</p><p>No silence ... no sound ... no word.</p><p>Gautam Buddha and his approach seem to be far more scientific: there
was only nothingness. That nothingness is our very being. We have come
out of that nothingness and we will disappear into that nothingness one
day.</p><p>So make friends with that nothingness, because it is going to be your
eternal home. To make friends with nothingness is all that is meant by
meditation. And as you observe your thoughts, slowly, slowly they
disappear, and only a pure nothingness surrounds you. You have come to
the beginning of the world, which is also the end of the world. You have
come to the source and you have come to the goal.</p><p>In this state only your awareness is the truth. That's why Buddha and
all those people who have awakened to the ultimate truth don't recognize
the hypothesis of God. In that nothingness they don't find any God,
unless you want to call nothingness "God." Then there is no problem</p><p>-- but it will give a very wrong understanding about nothingness.</p><p>I myself have come to the conclusion that rather than saying, "There
was no God" -- because it will unnecessarily hurt people and will not
help in any way -- it is better to say, "There was godliness." Just a
quality ... That nothingness was not empty; that nothingness was full,
overfull. It was full of consciousness, and consciousness is the divine
quality; you can call it godliness.</p><p>And the whole of existence is made of the same stuff. You can call it
nothingness, you can call it godliness -- it is only a question of
whether you prefer a negative description or a positive description, but
both the words mean the same thing.</p><p>AS YOU FEEL, says Ta Hui, YOU'RE LOSING YOUR GRIP MORE AND MORE
AND</p><p>YOUR HEART IS MORE AND MORE UNEASY ... When you observe your thoughts
and this nothingness starts surrounding you, there is always a
possibility that your heart will start sinking. You may become afraid,
scared.</p><p>Don't be scared and don't be uneasy. It is happening only because of
your old habit. You have never experienced nothingness, otherwise there
is nothing more blissful, there is nothing more peaceful, there is
nothing more alive.</p><p>... DON'T GIVE UP AND SLACK OFF: THIS IS THE PLACE TO CUT OFF THE</p><p>HEADS OF THE THOUSAND SAGES. This refers to a certain statement of
Gautam Buddha. He used to say to his disciples, "If I meet you on the
way, don't hesitate -- immediately cut my head. Most probably I will
meet you" -- because the disciples have loved him so much and the master
has showered so much love on them that when they become silent there is
every possibility the mind will play its last trick. The last trick will
be to bring the master himself ... and that will become the barrier to
seeing the nothingness.</p><p>Gautam Buddha is absolutely right: "Cut my head immediately --
because I am not there, just mind is playing the last game, the last
resort."</p><p>It happened in Ramakrishna's life ... He was a worshiper of
mother-goddess Kali, and he came in contact with an enlightened
wandering monk, Totapuri. Totapuri said to him,</p><p>"Although you have progressed so much, you are stuck. You are stuck
with this goddess ... because there is no goddess, nothing; it is just
your imagination."</p><p>Ramakrishna was already worshiped by thousands of people, but when
Totapuri said this to him he immediately recognized that the man was
right. He said to Totapuri, "Help me -- because when I close my eyes
everything else disappears. Only the mother-goddess remains, so
beautiful, so radiant that I forget completely that I have to enter into
nothingness. She is so beautiful and so charming that I get lost into
her beauty and into her energy. And when I wake up I cry, because I
wanted to go beyond her but she seems to surround me like a boundary,
like a jail, from everywhere."</p><p>Totapuri said, "You sit before me, and just look at this piece of
glass." Ramakrishna said, "What is the purpose of that piece of
glass?"</p><p>Totapuri said, "I will watch your face, because I know -- I have
watched you: when you see the mother-goddess inside yourself your face
becomes so beautiful, so graceful that I will know immediately that you
have come to encounter your illusion that you have been conditioning
yourself with for years. I will immediately cut just on your forehead
with this piece of glass, and as I cut and blood starts flowing, you
also take courage and cut the head of the mother-goddess."</p><p>Ramakrishna said, "It is very difficult. And moreover from where am I
going to get the sword?"</p><p>Totapuri laughed and he said, "If you can imagine the mother-goddess,
can't you imagine a sword? It is all imagination. And if you miss, I am
not going to stay here anymore. So don't miss this chance, otherwise in
this life perhaps you will not meet another Totapuri."</p><p>Ramakrishna closed his eyes and as he became radiant, joyful and his
face started showing that he was seeing something tremendously
beautiful, Totapuri cut exactly what in the East is called the third
eye. From the top of his forehead he went down to his nose, cutting the
skin. Blood was flowing and Ramakrishna gathered courage, pulled out his
sword -- he could not believe from where this sword had come -- and he
cut the head of the mother-goddess. It was very difficult because he had
loved this mother for years. He had been dancing and singing, chanting;
he was creating the illusion -- otherwise there are no mother-goddesses,
no father-gods, except in man's imagination, except in man's childish
fixation on mothers and fathers.</p><p>He cut the head and he could not believe it: the mother fell in two
parts, the head on this side and the body on that side. And it was as if
a door opened -- a door to nothingness, to infinity ... for six days he
remained in that state.</p><p>After six days he opened his eyes -- there were tears in his eyes --
and the first words he spoke to Totapuri were, "The last barrier has
fallen. I am grateful to you. You have shown tremendous compassion."</p><p>That was the last day. After that he never went into the temple of
the mother-goddess; after that he never mentioned the name of the
mother-goddess. And after that he was a totally different man -- so
silent, so peaceful, so joyous, as if there was not a single worry in
the world.</p><p>He lived almost three years after this experience, and those three
years were his most precious years. People who have sat by his side --
and he was not very ancient, he existed just</p><p>in the last century, in the last years of the past century. So just a
hundred years ago he was here, and I have come across people in Bengal
whose grandfathers sat with Ramakrishna, and they still remember their
grandfathers telling them about the man.</p><p>Those three years he was not speaking ... Once in a while he would
tell a small story, once in a while he would dance, but otherwise he
would sit silently with hundreds of disciples, all enjoying and sharing
the ultimate nothingness.</p><p>STUDENTS OF THE PATH OFTEN RETREAT AT THIS POINT. Those who are</p><p>beginners are naturally afraid when they come across nothingness.
Naturally the fear arises as if they are drowning, as if this
nothingness is going to swallow them. It is true: it will swallow ...
but only that which you are not. Only your false personality will
disappear; just your authentic being will remain in its crystal-clear
purity.</p><p>There is no need to fear. The master is needed at such stages. This
is the last stage where the master is needed -- not to let you retreat,
but to give you a good push, just a little encouragement: "Don't be
worried, I have also been through the same stage; there is nothing to be
feared. It is not death. This nothingness is not death; this nothingness
is purest life."</p><p>IF YOUR FAITH IS THOROUGHGOING, JUST KEEP CONTEMPLATING WHAT'S BEFORE
THE THOUGHT OF SEEKING INSTRUCTION IN THE DIRECT ESSENTIALS ARISES.
SUDDENLY YOU WILL AWAKEN FROM YOUR DREAM, AND THERE WON'T BE ANY MISTAKE
ABOUT IT.</p><p>Allow this nothingness to take possession of you ... and all your
dreams disappear; your sleep, your spiritual sleep cannot remain
anymore.</p><p>I have to explain something to you at this point. For thousands of
years it has been thought that dreams are a kind of disturbance to
sleep, but the latest findings say just the opposite. Dreams are not a
disturbance to your sleep, they are very protective and helpful to your
sleep. They prevent your sleep from being broken.</p><p>For example, you feel hungry and you are asleep, and a dream arises
that you are going into the kitchen and you are opening the fridge, and
you are taking a good share of sweets or ice cream or whatsoever you
like -- because in a dream there is no question, whatsoever you like ...
The dream is very generous -- and as much you like, because dreams don't
listen to doctors.</p><p>This way the dream has protected your sleep, otherwise the hunger
would have disturbed you. Now you feel you have taken enough and the
sleep continues.</p><p>Recent research about dream and sleep have made many things clear.
Out of eight hours you would not think that you are dreaming almost six
hours; for only two hours are you asleep, and even that is not in a
single piece for two hours -- a few minutes here, a few minutes there
... In six hours of dreams, for just a few fragments here and there are
you asleep.</p><p>There has been an experiment done in many psychological labs. A
person was disturbed whenever he was dreaming. It is very easy to know
when a person is dreaming: if you are sitting by the side of your wife
or your husband or your friend, the moment you see his eyes start moving
under the eyelids he is starting to dream. So it is very easy to know
when he is dreaming and when he is not dreaming, because when he dreams
then naturally he is seeing scenes, almost like a film, and his eyes
start moving. When he is simply asleep his eyes don't move.</p><p>Experiments have been done: whenever a person would dream, they would
wake him up, they would disturb his dream. They would allow him to
sleep, but they would not allow him to dream. And they were surprised
that although he had slept two, three hours -- which was the most that
he would sleep -- he was very tired, exhausted, he was not rejuvenated;
in the morning he did not feel like getting up. They could not believe
it; they were thinking that although his dreams were being disturbed,
his sleep would be complete. The old idea had been that it is the sleep
that rejuvenates you, revitalizes you.</p><p>Then they did another experiment. They would disturb the person when
he was asleep, they would not let him sleep; he could dream as much as
he wanted -- his dreaming time they would leave undisturbed. And the
strange finding was that in the morning the man was more fresh than he
had ever been. He had not slept at all; the whole night he had been in a
movie house, and he was not tired.</p><p>So two things have become clear: one, that dreams are not disturbing
the sleep but are protecting and guarding it; second, dreams are more
necessary for your health than your sleep, because dreams are throwing
out all the garbage that you collect the whole day. They clean your
whole being -- six hours spring-cleaning -- so in the morning you feel
fresh.</p><p>Why am I telling you about this experiment? Because the same applies
to the spiritual sleep. The moment your dreams disappear in meditation
-- thoughts, images; these are all dreams -- when they all disappear,
then your spiritual sleep cannot remain; your dreams were protecting it.
So just as on the ordinary mental level it is true, it is true on the
spiritual level too, exactly in the same way. Once dreams have
disappeared, that means meditation has come to maturity.</p><p>And after the dreams are gone, suddenly you will feel a new
awakening. You have been waking up every morning, but once you wake up
from your spiritual sleep, then you will see the difference, and why in
the East we have been dividing sleep into four stages. The first stage
is so-called waking; the second stage is dreaming; the third stage,
sleep, and the fourth stage, real awakening.</p><p>The so-called waking we all know; every morning we wake up. The
enlightened being knows the real awakening. It has some quality of our
awakening, but our awakening is very small, a very thin layer.</p><p>The awakening of a Gautam Buddha is total. In that total awakening
there is a luminous awareness surrounded by a positive nothingness. It
is not empty, it is overfull. Rather than say nothingness, Gautam Buddha
used to say "no-thingness." Things have disappeared ... and what has
remained is inexpressible. We try to express it as blissfulness, as
ecstasy, as eternal joy, but these are faraway echoes of the real thing.
They don't represent it exactly -- there is no way.</p><p>In our language we cannot translate the experience of the ultimate
awakening, but a few hints can be given.</p><p>Ta Hui's suggestions to the young seeker are all significant: FAITH
IS THOROUGHGOING ... It has to be thoroughgoing, but one has to remember
it is not the faith in a church, it is not the faith in a holy
scripture; it is simply faith in yourself.</p><p>The function of the master is not to create faith in him, but to
create faith in yourself. An authentic master makes you more and more
trusting in your own individuality, in your own</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

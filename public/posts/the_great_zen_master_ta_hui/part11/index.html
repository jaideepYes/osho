Many of them were my teachers, many of them were students who knew me when I was a student in that university, and their vice-chancellor touching my feet ... My old professors gathered when I came down after speaking, saying, \"This is a strange phenomenon. We had never expected ...\"\nI said, \"I was studying under you, but you never looked deeply into me, you never looked into my eyes. You never thought about the questions I was asking. You simply thought of one thing -- that I was just creating trouble for you because you had no answer, and you were not courageous enough to say, 'I don't know.'\"\nIntellectuals are very weak about one point. They cannot say, \"I don't know.\"\nOnly an enlightened being can say, \"I don't know.\" His innocence and his enlightenment are synonymous.\nOkay Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n9\nIllusion\n19 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, THE GREAT AFFAIR\nTHIS AFFAIR IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY, CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING. THOUGH YOU TRY TO GRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON IT, IT ALWAYS REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY. LIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON WATER, IT CANNOT BE REINED IN OR HELD DOWN. SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, WHEN GOOD PEOPLE OF THE PATH HAVE ATTAINED THIS, THEY'VE APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA OF BIRTH AND DEATH, ABLE TO USE IT FULLY. THERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP SANDALWOOD, EACH PIECE IS IT.\nSINCE THERE IS NO PLACE TO LOCATE IT, BUDDHA IS ILLUSION AND DHARMA IS ILLUSION: THE THREE WORLDS, TWENTY-FIVE STATES OF BEING, THE SENSE ORGANS, SENSE OBJECTS, AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE UTTERLY EMPTY. WHEN YOU GET TO THIS REALM, THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA'; IF EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE THUSNESS, BUDDHA-NATURE, ENLIGHTENMENT OR NIRVANA? THUS THE GREAT BEING FU SAID, \"FEARING THAT PEOPLE WILL GIVE RISE TO A VIEW OF ANNIHILATION, WE PROVISIONALLY ESTABLISH EMPTY NAMES.\"\nIn all the sutras up to now, Ta Hui has not been able to establish himself as an enlightened being. He is trying hard, he is using the most logical and intellectual methods, but they are empty; they don't carry any weight. For example, when he says, \"All the senses, self-nature, dharma, all are illusory,\" one has to ask him, \"To whom are you talking?\" And, \"Who is talking?\" He has used the word 'illusory' without understanding its implications.\nAnybody who is not aware of both the intellectual potentialities and the nature of 'no-mind' will not be able to figure out whether this man is authentic or pseudo.\nBefore I go into his sutras, I am reminded of a beautiful incident about the Adi Shankaracharya, the first shankaracharya, who established four temples -- the four seats of shankaracharyas for all the four directions. Perhaps in the whole world, he is the most famous of those philosophers who are trying to establish that everything is illusory. Without doubt he was a great logician, because he went on conquering other philosophers; he moved all over the country and defeated all other schools of philosophy. He established his philosophy as the only right vision, the only right perspective: that all is maya, illusion.\nShankaracharya was in Varanasi. One day, early in the morning -- it was still dark because traditionally the Hindu monks take a bath before sunrise -- he took a bath. And as he was coming up the steps, a man touched him on purpose, not accidentally, and told him, \"Please forgive me. I am a sudra, I am untouchable. I am sorry, but you will have to take another bath to clean yourself.\"\nShankaracharya was very angry. He said, \"It was not accidental, the way you did that; you did it on purpose. You should be punished in hell.\"\nThe man said, \"When all is illusory, it seems only hell remains real.\" That took Shankaracharya aback.\nThe man said, \"Before you go for your bath, you have to answer my few questions. If you don't answer me, each time you come up after your bath, I will touch you.\"\nIt was lonely and nobody else was there, so Shankaracharya said, \"You seem to be a very strange person. What are your questions?\"\nHe said, \"My first question is: Is my body illusory? Is your body illusory? And if two illusions touch each other, what is the problem? Why are you going to take another bath? You are not practicing what you are preaching. How, in an illusory world, can there be a distinction between the untouchable and the brahmin? -- the pure and the impure? -- when both are illusory, when both are made of the same stuff as dreams are made of? What is the fuss?\"\nShankaracharya, who had been conquering great philosophers, could not answer this simple man because any answer was going to be against his philosophy. If he says they are illusory, then there is no point in being angry about it. If he says they are real, then at least he accepts the reality of bodies ... but then there is a problem. If human bodies are real, then animal bodies, the bodies of the trees, the bodies of the planets, the stars ... then everything is real.\nAnd the man said, \"I know you cannot answer this -- it will finish your whole philosophy. I'll ask you another question: I am a sudra, untouchable, impure, but where is my impurity -- in my body or in my soul? I have heard you declaring that the soul is absolutely and forever pure, and there is no way to make it impure; so how can there be a distinction between souls? Both are pure, absolutely pure, and there are no degrees of impurity -- that somebody is more pure and somebody is less pure. So perhaps it is my soul that has made you impure and you have to take another bath?\"\nThat was even more difficult. But he had never been in such trouble -- actual, practical, in a way scientific. Rather than arguing about words, the sudra had created a situation in which the great Adi Shankaracharya accepted his defeat. And the sudra said, \"Then don't go take another bath. Anyway there is no river, no me, no you; all is a dream. Just go in the temple -- that too is a dream -- and pray to God. He too is a dream, because he is a projection of a mind which is illusory, and an illusory mind cannot project anything real.\nWhat Ta Hui is saying here is something similar. He does not understand the implications.\nLet us look into each sutra.\nTHIS AFFAIR -- this affair of enlightenment -- IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY, CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING. THOUGH YOU TRY TO\nGRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON IT, IT ALWAYS REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY.\nThese words he must have borrowed, because these are the words of a man who knows. Each single sentence is impeccably true. This affair -- the affair of enlightenment or liberation or self-realization -- is like the bright sun. It has been the experience of thousands of mystics that when they reach the highest peak of their consciousness there is an explosion of light, something like an atomic explosion.\nOne of the great mystics, Kabir, says, \"It is shining so much that it seems one thousand suns have risen suddenly around me. Wherever I look, the sun that I used to see seems completely paled ... the brightness of these one thousand suns is so much. It has purified every fiber and cell of my being, as if I have passed through fire the way gold does. All that is not gold is destroyed by the fire and only the pure gold comes out.\n\"Passing through this experience of one thousand suns, for the first time I know what purity means -- its fragrance, its freshness, its absolute newness. It is never stale, it is never past, it is never present, it is never future. You cannot divide it into time segments. It always is; it is the very nature of existence itself.\"\nSo Ta Hui is quoting these words without quotation marks, which is one of the cunning strategies of all the intellectuals of the world. They go on stealing from every source, and pretending that it is their own experience. But they cannot manage it -- sooner or later something immediately shows their stupidity.\nTHIS AFFAIR IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY, CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING. THOUGH YOU TRY TO GRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON IT, IT ALWAYS REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY.\nThese sentences are certainly stolen from someone who knows. And the reason I am saying they are stolen is because just as we enter into further sutras it becomes clear that he is not aware that they are showing his ignorance.\nLIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON WATER, IT CANNOT BE REINED IN OR HELD DOWN. SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, WHEN GOOD PEOPLE OF THE PATH HAVE ATTAINED THIS, THEY'VE APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA OF BIRTH AND DEATH, ABLE TO USE IT FULLY. THERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP SANDALWOOD, EACH PIECE IS IT.\nThe first thing that he has wrong is that enlightened people are not, and cannot be called, good people. One can become a good person without being enlightened; in fact one can become a good person even without believing that there is consciousness, soul, or God. Do\nyou think the atheists have not produced good people? Epicurus in Greece was a great atheist but you cannot find a better man; you cannot find anything to blame in his life.\nIn India there has been a big school of atheists called Charvakas. They did not believe in any other world, in God, in reincarnation, in the existence of the soul. They were purely materialists, but they produced such good people that even the theist Hindu scriptures mention their originator with great respect as Acharya Brespati, the great master Brespati. They don't agree with his ideas, but they cannot disagree with his character, with his goodness.\nThe enlightened person is beyond good and evil. You cannot confine him to the word good. He is neither good nor evil, he is simply aware. Good passes in front of him and evil passes in front of him, and he remains unaffected. Whatever he does, he does not follow any ethical code or any morality; he simply follows his own awareness. So the good is not a goal for him, it is simply a by-product of his awareness. He is not doing virtuous things and he is not waiting for any reward. He is simply conscious; he has eyes.\nDo you think that because you have eyes and you can see the trees and the sun, you need some reward for it? Or because you can see the door and can go out or come in, do you think you need some reward for it?\nThe man of awareness simply has eyes.\nThe moralist has no eyes of his own. He is practicing what has been said traditionally to be good. He does not know exactly whether it is good or not; people just say it is good. He is born amongst people who believe it is good, and because by doing it he is honored, respected\n-- his ego is fulfilled -- he goes on doing it. It is a beautiful arrangement; here it is ego-fulfilling and there in the other world, after death, he will be showered with great rewards. He is really doing a good business.\nThe enlightened man has no reward. He has the greatest thing in the world: a total awareness. Now nothing can be added to his richness. He is neither good nor bad; this is where Ta Hui shows his ignorance about the enlightened people.\nSecondly he says, they've appeared and disappeared in the sea of birth and death. That is absolutely wrong. Once a man is enlightened, he never comes back into a womb; he goes beyond birth and death. Good men are bound to be born, are bound to die, but not the enlightened one. The very foundation of enlightenment is to get free from the wheel of birth and death, and to enter into universal life -- formless, without a body. A body is a confinement, it is an imprisonment. Consciousness need not have a body; it can be just pure, formless space.\nOnce a man is enlightened, he never comes back into another body. And because Ta Hui is saying that \"he appears and disappears in the sea of birth and death,\" he is showing his ignorance about the whole affair of enlightenment.\nThe last sentence is certainly beautiful and significant, but it is again stolen; it is stolen from Gautam Buddha himself. Buddha was always asked, \"Does the experience of awakening, in different people, have the same taste, the same flower, or is it different?\" And he has used two statements. One is: \"The sea is vast, but you can taste it from anywhere and it is always salty; it has the same taste.\" And second: \"Like cutting up sandalwood, each piece is it.\" You can cut the sandalwood into many pieces, but each piece will have the same fragrance; it will not be different in different pieces.\nThis is a famous statement of Gautam Buddha. Ta Hui has simply used it.\nTHERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP SANDALWOOD, EACH PIECE IS IT.\nSINCE THERE IS NO PLACE TO LOCATE IT, BUDDHA IS ILLUSION AND DHARMA IS ILLUSION.\nThe reason that he is giving for why buddha is illusion and why dharma, the nature of enlightenment, is illusion is that you cannot find a place to locate them. Can you find a place to locate space? Can you find a place to locate time? Is time illusory? Is space illusory?\nJust because you cannot locate them ... they are formless, hence location is not possible. If you make it a criterion that anything that cannot be located and pointed at is not real, then only things which have boundaries will be real and things that don't have any boundaries will not be real. Then your body will be real, because it can be located, and your consciousness will be unreal, because it cannot be located.\nTa Hui does not understand the implication of what he is saying. Just in the beginning he was talking about the affair of enlightenment, and there he did not mention at all that he was talking about an illusory affair. It was bright sun in the blue sky, shining clearly, changeless and motionless, without diminishing or increasing. it shines everywhere. A thing that shines everywhere, of course, cannot be located. You can locate a thing which exists somewhere, but a thing that exists everywhere cannot be located.\n... appearing in everything. If it were appearing in some things, to locate it would be possible, but if it is appearing in everything ... If rocks are also buddhas, fast asleep, and they don't have any qualitative difference from enlightened beings ... They are aware and the rocks are fast asleep, but being asleep or awake doesn't make any difference to their basic reality.\nIn all those statements ... he is saying, though you try to grasp it, you cannot get it -- you cannot grasp it because it is so vast, and so formless. Though you try to abandon it, it always remains. You cannot abandon it because it is everywhere; wherever you go you will find it. It is within you, it is without you. Those statements were absolutely right, but they are not his experiences.\nThe later sutras show that he cannot befool, he cannot deceive: Since there is no place to locate it, buddha is illusory. Suddenly, that which was shining in the blue sky like the bright sun has become illusory. And even the nature of awareness, which is dharma, has become illusory.\nThe three worlds -- hell, earth and heaven -- twenty-five states of being, the sense organs, sense objects, and consciousness are utterly empty. He is not leaving anything which is real. Then to whom is he talking? Their ears are illusory, their eyes are illusory, and so it is the case with Ta Hui himself.\nAll the senses are illusory. The sense of seeing the people to whom he is talking, the very fact of talking ... if everything is illusory, then he is simply mad. What is the point of writing these sutras? For whom is he writing these sutras? And if everything is illusory, do you think that the paper on which these sutras are written ... only the ink and the paper are real? -- although the man who was writing was illusory.\nWhen you get to this realm, there is no place to put even the word 'buddha.' But that does not make buddha illusory, it simply makes the word inapplicable. In that experience no word is applicable. All words are just tentatively used. When one has become awakened he cannot say anything about his experience of awakening. It is true: there is not even space to place the word 'buddha.'\nIF EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE THUSNESS, BUDDHA-NATURE, ENLIGHTENMENT, OR NIRVANA?\nAnd he was talking about 'this affair' in the beginning of the sutras, where it extended throughout space. You could not grasp it because it was too vast, and you could not abandon it because where will you abandon it? Wherever you go, you will find it. You are in it, you ARE it.\nThose statements were perfectly true. But now he is saying,\nIF EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE THUSNESS?\nNow where is the great idea of true thusness, or buddha-nature, or enlightenment, or nirvana? Now everything is denied.\nIn these small sutras he has done a great job! What he says in the beginning, and says very clearly, he denies in the end. It is just intellectual gymnastics. It is true, the word 'buddha' is arbitrary -- not because the existence of that for which we are using the word 'buddha' is illusory, but because the experience is so vast that even the word 'buddha' cannot contain it.\nIt is not that the experience of thusness is illusory; in fact it is one of the greatest disciplines of awareness that has arisen in thousands of years.\nIf one can say and feel and experience the nature of thusness, tathata, he will not be disturbed by pain, he will not be disturbed by pleasure, he will not be disturbed by failure, he will not be disturbed by success. He will simply say, \"Thus is the case. Such is the way things happen in nature. I am just a witness. Right now success is passing in front of me like a cloud. Soon failure will follow, just as day is followed by night. This moment it is pleasure, soon it will bring pain, but I am absolutely aloof -- they don't even touch me. I am beyond their grasp.\"\nThis is one of the greatest approaches to reality that has come to man's understanding: the idea of 'thusness' or 'suchness.' And Ta Hui is saying it is illusory! and then that even enlightenment is illusory, buddha-nature is illusory, nirvana is illusory. One has to ask Ta Hui how you can call something illusory unless there is something real in existence; otherwise, how will you compare?\nYou can call something illusory only because something else is real. But if there is nothing real, then there is nothing illusory either. They have to exist together. He does not talk about what is real; in fact, all that is great and real, he is calling illusory. Now what is real? And if he says there is nothing which is real, then he has no right to call anything illusory.\nTHUS THE GREAT BEING FU SAID, \"FEARING THAT PEOPLE WILL GIVE RISE TO A VIEW OF ANNIHILATION, WE PROVISIONALLY ESTABLISH EMPTY NAMES.\"\nHe goes on quoting enlightened people out of context. What the great master Fu said does not mean what Ta Hui wants it to mean. He has put it in a context: he is calling enlightenment, buddhahood, thusness, nirvana, all illusory, and then he quotes master Fu, fearing that people will give rise to a view of annihilation if they are told that everything is illusory ...\nThat's why buddhas have not said that. They have talked about enlightenment and thusness and buddha-nature and nirvana, just so that people don't get the view of a total negativity, of an utter emptiness, annihilation.\nWe provisionally establish empty names. All these names are empty, but Fu's meaning is totally different. What Ta Hui wants him to mean is not his meaning. He is saying: \"We are giving provisional, empty names -- but the empty names are given to realities, not to illusions. They are provisional and empty because they cannot contain the vast reality of nirvana, enlightenment, thusness, buddha-nature. So just to give a small indication we have used provisional, empty names.\" But once a person comes to experience himself, he will be able to see that all names were only provisional.\nTo tell them in the beginning that everything is illusory ... They are already in misery, they are in deep anguish, and he tells them that there is no possibility of getting beyond it because everything that can take one beyond is illusory! But very strange is the fact that he does not call people's misery illusory: their sadness is illusory, their egos are illusory, their intellects are illusory, their minds are illusory -- he does not mention these things.\nAnd if everything is truly illusory, then what is the fear? If illusory people feel afraid, what is wrong in it? The people don't exist, so let them fear! Non-existential people are fearing annihilation; they are already no more -- so what more annihilation can happen to them?\nNo, the people are real, although their conception about themselves is not real. They have to find their authentic reality, and that authentic reality is so vast that we have to give it provisional names -- provisional, because once you have reached it you will see that those names were just utilitarian. They don't define and they don't confine the experience. That's what master Fu meant when he said, we provisionally establish empty names.\nBut if there is nobody, if master Fu is illusory and the people he is concerned about -- the ones that may become afraid of annihilation -- don't exist, then what is the problem? Everything is solved: there is no need of any preaching, there is no need of any scriptures, there is no need of any meditation, there is no need to go beyond your anguish, anxiety, misery. You yourself don't exist; how can you be miserable? Have you ever heard of somebody who does not exist feeling very much worried, someone who has never existed going through a migraine?

touched my feet, and said to the audience, "To be learned is one thing,
and to know on your own experience -- face to face -- is a totally
different thing. In my long life I have been in high positions, and I
have come across so many learned people, and I can say with absolute
confidence that learning brings no transformation to their being. The
transformation of one's being comes through some other door, not through
the doors of mind."</p><p>It was a great shock! Many of them were my teachers, many of them
were students who knew me when I was a student in that university, and
their vice-chancellor touching my feet ... My old professors gathered
when I came down after speaking, saying, "This is a strange phenomenon.
We had never expected ..."</p><p>I said, "I was studying under you, but you never looked deeply into
me, you never looked into my eyes. You never thought about the questions
I was asking. You simply thought of one thing -- that I was just
creating trouble for you because you had no answer, and you were not
courageous enough to say, 'I don't know.'"</p><p>Intellectuals are very weak about one point. They cannot say, "I
don't know."</p><p>Only an enlightened being can say, "I don't know." His innocence and
his enlightenment are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>9</p><p>Illusion</p><p>19 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, THE GREAT AFFAIR</p><p>THIS AFFAIR IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY,
CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES
EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING.
THOUGH YOU TRY TO GRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON
IT, IT ALWAYS REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY. LIKE
A GOURD FLOATING ON WATER, IT CANNOT BE REINED IN OR HELD DOWN. SINCE
ANCIENT TIMES, WHEN GOOD PEOPLE OF THE PATH HAVE ATTAINED THIS, THEY'VE
APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA OF BIRTH AND DEATH, ABLE TO USE IT
FULLY. THERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP SANDALWOOD, EACH
PIECE IS IT.</p><p>SINCE THERE IS NO PLACE TO LOCATE IT, BUDDHA IS ILLUSION AND DHARMA
IS ILLUSION: THE THREE WORLDS, TWENTY-FIVE STATES OF BEING, THE SENSE
ORGANS, SENSE OBJECTS, AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE UTTERLY EMPTY. WHEN YOU GET
TO THIS REALM, THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA'; IF EVEN
THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE THUSNESS,
BUDDHA-NATURE, ENLIGHTENMENT OR NIRVANA? THUS THE GREAT BEING FU SAID,
"FEARING THAT PEOPLE WILL GIVE RISE TO A VIEW OF ANNIHILATION, WE
PROVISIONALLY ESTABLISH EMPTY NAMES."</p><p><br></p><p>In all the sutras up to now, Ta Hui has not been able to establish
himself as an enlightened being. He is trying hard, he is using the most
logical and intellectual methods, but they are empty; they don't carry
any weight. For example, when he says, "All the senses, self-nature,
dharma, all are illusory," one has to ask him, "To whom are you
talking?" And, "Who is talking?" He has used the word 'illusory' without
understanding its implications.</p><p>Anybody who is not aware of both the intellectual potentialities and
the nature of 'no-mind' will not be able to figure out whether this man
is authentic or pseudo.</p><p>Before I go into his sutras, I am reminded of a beautiful incident
about the Adi Shankaracharya, the first shankaracharya, who established
four temples -- the four seats of shankaracharyas for all the four
directions. Perhaps in the whole world, he is the most famous of those
philosophers who are trying to establish that everything is illusory.
Without doubt he was a great logician, because he went on conquering
other philosophers; he moved all over the country and defeated all other
schools of philosophy. He established his philosophy as the only right
vision, the only right perspective: that all is maya, illusion.</p><p>Shankaracharya was in Varanasi. One day, early in the morning -- it
was still dark because traditionally the Hindu monks take a bath before
sunrise -- he took a bath. And as he was coming up the steps, a man
touched him on purpose, not accidentally, and told him, "Please forgive
me. I am a sudra, I am untouchable. I am sorry, but you will have to
take another bath to clean yourself."</p><p>Shankaracharya was very angry. He said, "It was not accidental, the
way you did that; you did it on purpose. You should be punished in
hell."</p><p>The man said, "When all is illusory, it seems only hell remains
real." That took Shankaracharya aback.</p><p>The man said, "Before you go for your bath, you have to answer my few
questions. If you don't answer me, each time you come up after your
bath, I will touch you."</p><p>It was lonely and nobody else was there, so Shankaracharya said, "You
seem to be a very strange person. What are your questions?"</p><p>He said, "My first question is: Is my body illusory? Is your body
illusory? And if two illusions touch each other, what is the problem?
Why are you going to take another bath? You are not practicing what you
are preaching. How, in an illusory world, can there be a distinction
between the untouchable and the brahmin? -- the pure and the impure? --
when both are illusory, when both are made of the same stuff as dreams
are made of? What is the fuss?"</p><p>Shankaracharya, who had been conquering great philosophers, could not
answer this simple man because any answer was going to be against his
philosophy. If he says they are illusory, then there is no point in
being angry about it. If he says they are real, then at least he accepts
the reality of bodies ... but then there is a problem. If human bodies
are real, then animal bodies, the bodies of the trees, the bodies of the
planets, the stars ... then everything is real.</p><p>And the man said, "I know you cannot answer this -- it will finish
your whole philosophy. I'll ask you another question: I am a sudra,
untouchable, impure, but where is my impurity -- in my body or in my
soul? I have heard you declaring that the soul is absolutely and forever
pure, and there is no way to make it impure; so how can there be a
distinction between souls? Both are pure, absolutely pure, and there are
no degrees of impurity -- that somebody is more pure and somebody is
less pure. So perhaps it is my soul that has made you impure and you
have to take another bath?"</p><p>That was even more difficult. But he had never been in such trouble
-- actual, practical, in a way scientific. Rather than arguing about
words, the sudra had created a situation in which the great Adi
Shankaracharya accepted his defeat. And the sudra said, "Then don't go
take another bath. Anyway there is no river, no me, no you; all is a
dream. Just go in the temple -- that too is a dream -- and pray to God.
He too is a dream, because he is a projection of a mind which is
illusory, and an illusory mind cannot project anything real.</p><p>What Ta Hui is saying here is something similar. He does not
understand the implications.</p><p>Let us look into each sutra.</p><p>THIS AFFAIR -- this affair of enlightenment -- IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN
IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY, CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT
DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES
OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING. THOUGH YOU TRY TO</p><p>GRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON IT, IT ALWAYS
REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY.</p><p><br></p><p>These words he must have borrowed, because these are the words of a
man who knows. Each single sentence is impeccably true. This affair --
the affair of enlightenment or liberation or self-realization -- is like
the bright sun. It has been the experience of thousands of mystics that
when they reach the highest peak of their consciousness there is an
explosion of light, something like an atomic explosion.</p><p>One of the great mystics, Kabir, says, "It is shining so much that it
seems one thousand suns have risen suddenly around me. Wherever I look,
the sun that I used to see seems completely paled ... the brightness of
these one thousand suns is so much. It has purified every fiber and cell
of my being, as if I have passed through fire the way gold does. All
that is not gold is destroyed by the fire and only the pure gold comes
out.</p><p>"Passing through this experience of one thousand suns, for the first
time I know what purity means -- its fragrance, its freshness, its
absolute newness. It is never stale, it is never past, it is never
present, it is never future. You cannot divide it into time segments. It
always is; it is the very nature of existence itself."</p><p>So Ta Hui is quoting these words without quotation marks, which is
one of the cunning strategies of all the intellectuals of the world.
They go on stealing from every source, and pretending that it is their
own experience. But they cannot manage it -- sooner or later something
immediately shows their stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS AFFAIR IS LIKE THE BRIGHT SUN IN THE BLUE SKY, SHINING CLEARLY,
CHANGELESS AND MOTIONLESS, WITHOUT DIMINISHING OR INCREASING. IT SHINES
EVERYWHERE IN THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF EVERYONE, APPEARING IN EVERYTHING.
THOUGH YOU TRY TO GRASP IT, YOU CANNOT GET IT; THOUGH YOU TRY TO ABANDON
IT, IT ALWAYS REMAINS. IT IS VAST AND UNOBSTRUCTED, UTTERLY EMPTY.</p><p><br></p><p>These sentences are certainly stolen from someone who knows. And the
reason I am saying they are stolen is because just as we enter into
further sutras it becomes clear that he is not aware that they are
showing his ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE A GOURD FLOATING ON WATER, IT CANNOT BE REINED IN OR HELD DOWN.
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, WHEN GOOD PEOPLE OF THE PATH HAVE ATTAINED THIS,
THEY'VE APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA OF BIRTH AND DEATH, ABLE TO
USE IT FULLY. THERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP
SANDALWOOD, EACH PIECE IS IT.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that he has wrong is that enlightened people are not,
and cannot be called, good people. One can become a good person without
being enlightened; in fact one can become a good person even without
believing that there is consciousness, soul, or God. Do</p><p>you think the atheists have not produced good people? Epicurus in
Greece was a great atheist but you cannot find a better man; you cannot
find anything to blame in his life.</p><p>In India there has been a big school of atheists called Charvakas.
They did not believe in any other world, in God, in reincarnation, in
the existence of the soul. They were purely materialists, but they
produced such good people that even the theist Hindu scriptures mention
their originator with great respect as Acharya Brespati, the great
master Brespati. They don't agree with his ideas, but they cannot
disagree with his character, with his goodness.</p><p>The enlightened person is beyond good and evil. You cannot confine
him to the word good. He is neither good nor evil, he is simply aware.
Good passes in front of him and evil passes in front of him, and he
remains unaffected. Whatever he does, he does not follow any ethical
code or any morality; he simply follows his own awareness. So the good
is not a goal for him, it is simply a by-product of his awareness. He is
not doing virtuous things and he is not waiting for any reward. He is
simply conscious; he has eyes.</p><p>Do you think that because you have eyes and you can see the trees and
the sun, you need some reward for it? Or because you can see the door
and can go out or come in, do you think you need some reward for it?</p><p>The man of awareness simply has eyes.</p><p>The moralist has no eyes of his own. He is practicing what has been
said traditionally to be good. He does not know exactly whether it is
good or not; people just say it is good. He is born amongst people who
believe it is good, and because by doing it he is honored, respected</p><p>-- his ego is fulfilled -- he goes on doing it. It is a beautiful
arrangement; here it is ego-fulfilling and there in the other world,
after death, he will be showered with great rewards. He is really doing
a good business.</p><p>The enlightened man has no reward. He has the greatest thing in the
world: a total awareness. Now nothing can be added to his richness. He
is neither good nor bad; this is where Ta Hui shows his ignorance about
the enlightened people.</p><p>Secondly he says, they've appeared and disappeared in the sea of
birth and death. That is absolutely wrong. Once a man is enlightened, he
never comes back into a womb; he goes beyond birth and death. Good men
are bound to be born, are bound to die, but not the enlightened one. The
very foundation of enlightenment is to get free from the wheel of birth
and death, and to enter into universal life -- formless, without a body.
A body is a confinement, it is an imprisonment. Consciousness need not
have a body; it can be just pure, formless space.</p><p>Once a man is enlightened, he never comes back into another body. And
because Ta Hui is saying that "he appears and disappears in the sea of
birth and death," he is showing his ignorance about the whole affair of
enlightenment.</p><p>The last sentence is certainly beautiful and significant, but it is
again stolen; it is stolen from Gautam Buddha himself. Buddha was always
asked, "Does the experience of awakening, in different people, have the
same taste, the same flower, or is it different?" And he has used two
statements. One is: "The sea is vast, but you can taste it from anywhere
and it is always salty; it has the same taste." And second: "Like
cutting up sandalwood, each piece is it." You can cut the sandalwood
into many pieces, but each piece will have the same fragrance; it will
not be different in different pieces.</p><p>This is a famous statement of Gautam Buddha. Ta Hui has simply used
it.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS NO DEFICIT OR SURPLUS: LIKE CUTTING UP SANDALWOOD, EACH
PIECE IS IT.</p><p>SINCE THERE IS NO PLACE TO LOCATE IT, BUDDHA IS ILLUSION AND DHARMA
IS ILLUSION.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason that he is giving for why buddha is illusion and why
dharma, the nature of enlightenment, is illusion is that you cannot find
a place to locate them. Can you find a place to locate space? Can you
find a place to locate time? Is time illusory? Is space illusory?</p><p>Just because you cannot locate them ... they are formless, hence
location is not possible. If you make it a criterion that anything that
cannot be located and pointed at is not real, then only things which
have boundaries will be real and things that don't have any boundaries
will not be real. Then your body will be real, because it can be
located, and your consciousness will be unreal, because it cannot be
located.</p><p>Ta Hui does not understand the implication of what he is saying. Just
in the beginning he was talking about the affair of enlightenment, and
there he did not mention at all that he was talking about an illusory
affair. It was bright sun in the blue sky, shining clearly, changeless
and motionless, without diminishing or increasing. it shines everywhere.
A thing that shines everywhere, of course, cannot be located. You can
locate a thing which exists somewhere, but a thing that exists
everywhere cannot be located.</p><p>... appearing in everything. If it were appearing in some things, to
locate it would be possible, but if it is appearing in everything ... If
rocks are also buddhas, fast asleep, and they don't have any qualitative
difference from enlightened beings ... They are aware and the rocks are
fast asleep, but being asleep or awake doesn't make any difference to
their basic reality.</p><p>In all those statements ... he is saying, though you try to grasp it,
you cannot get it -- you cannot grasp it because it is so vast, and so
formless. Though you try to abandon it, it always remains. You cannot
abandon it because it is everywhere; wherever you go you will find it.
It is within you, it is without you. Those statements were absolutely
right, but they are not his experiences.</p><p>The later sutras show that he cannot befool, he cannot deceive: Since
there is no place to locate it, buddha is illusory. Suddenly, that which
was shining in the blue sky like the bright sun has become illusory. And
even the nature of awareness, which is dharma, has become illusory.</p><p>The three worlds -- hell, earth and heaven -- twenty-five states of
being, the sense organs, sense objects, and consciousness are utterly
empty. He is not leaving anything which is real. Then to whom is he
talking? Their ears are illusory, their eyes are illusory, and so it is
the case with Ta Hui himself.</p><p>All the senses are illusory. The sense of seeing the people to whom
he is talking, the very fact of talking ... if everything is illusory,
then he is simply mad. What is the point of writing these sutras? For
whom is he writing these sutras? And if everything is illusory, do you
think that the paper on which these sutras are written ... only the ink
and the paper are real? -- although the man who was writing was
illusory.</p><p>When you get to this realm, there is no place to put even the word
'buddha.' But that does not make buddha illusory, it simply makes the
word inapplicable. In that experience no word is applicable. All words
are just tentatively used. When one has become awakened he cannot say
anything about his experience of awakening. It is true: there is not
even space to place the word 'buddha.'</p><p><br></p><p>IF EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE
THUSNESS, BUDDHA-NATURE, ENLIGHTENMENT, OR NIRVANA?</p><p><br></p><p>And he was talking about 'this affair' in the beginning of the
sutras, where it extended throughout space. You could not grasp it
because it was too vast, and you could not abandon it because where will
you abandon it? Wherever you go, you will find it. You are in it, you
ARE it.</p><p>Those statements were perfectly true. But now he is saying,</p><p><br></p><p>IF EVEN THE WORD 'BUDDHA' HAS NO APPLICABILITY, WHERE IS THERE TRUE
THUSNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>Now where is the great idea of true thusness, or buddha-nature, or
enlightenment, or nirvana? Now everything is denied.</p><p>In these small sutras he has done a great job! What he says in the
beginning, and says very clearly, he denies in the end. It is just
intellectual gymnastics. It is true, the word 'buddha' is arbitrary --
not because the existence of that for which we are using the word
'buddha' is illusory, but because the experience is so vast that even
the word 'buddha' cannot contain it.</p><p>It is not that the experience of thusness is illusory; in fact it is
one of the greatest disciplines of awareness that has arisen in
thousands of years.</p><p>If one can say and feel and experience the nature of thusness,
tathata, he will not be disturbed by pain, he will not be disturbed by
pleasure, he will not be disturbed by failure, he will not be disturbed
by success. He will simply say, "Thus is the case. Such is the way
things happen in nature. I am just a witness. Right now success is
passing in front of me like a cloud. Soon failure will follow, just as
day is followed by night. This moment it is pleasure, soon it will bring
pain, but I am absolutely aloof -- they don't even touch me. I am beyond
their grasp."</p><p>This is one of the greatest approaches to reality that has come to
man's understanding: the idea of 'thusness' or 'suchness.' And Ta Hui is
saying it is illusory! and then that even enlightenment is illusory,
buddha-nature is illusory, nirvana is illusory. One has to ask Ta Hui
how you can call something illusory unless there is something real in
existence; otherwise, how will you compare?</p><p>You can call something illusory only because something else is real.
But if there is nothing real, then there is nothing illusory either.
They have to exist together. He does not talk about what is real; in
fact, all that is great and real, he is calling illusory. Now what is
real? And if he says there is nothing which is real, then he has no
right to call anything illusory.</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THE GREAT BEING FU SAID, "FEARING THAT PEOPLE WILL GIVE RISE TO
A VIEW OF ANNIHILATION, WE PROVISIONALLY ESTABLISH EMPTY NAMES."</p><p><br></p><p>He goes on quoting enlightened people out of context. What the great
master Fu said does not mean what Ta Hui wants it to mean. He has put it
in a context: he is calling enlightenment, buddhahood, thusness,
nirvana, all illusory, and then he quotes master Fu, fearing that people
will give rise to a view of annihilation if they are told that
everything is illusory ...</p><p>That's why buddhas have not said that. They have talked about
enlightenment and thusness and buddha-nature and nirvana, just so that
people don't get the view of a total negativity, of an utter emptiness,
annihilation.</p><p>We provisionally establish empty names. All these names are empty,
but Fu's meaning is totally different. What Ta Hui wants him to mean is
not his meaning. He is saying: "We are giving provisional, empty names
-- but the empty names are given to realities, not to illusions. They
are provisional and empty because they cannot contain the vast reality
of nirvana, enlightenment, thusness, buddha-nature. So just to give a
small indication we have used provisional, empty names." But once a
person comes to experience himself, he will be able to see that all
names were only provisional.</p><p>To tell them in the beginning that everything is illusory ... They
are already in misery, they are in deep anguish, and he tells them that
there is no possibility of getting beyond it because everything that can
take one beyond is illusory! But very strange is the fact that he does
not call people's misery illusory: their sadness is illusory, their egos
are illusory, their intellects are illusory, their minds are illusory --
he does not mention these things.</p><p>And if everything is truly illusory, then what is the fear? If
illusory people feel afraid, what is wrong in it? The people don't
exist, so let them fear! Non-existential people are fearing
annihilation; they are already no more -- so what more annihilation can
happen to them?</p><p>No, the people are real, although their conception about themselves
is not real. They have to find their authentic reality, and that
authentic reality is so vast that we have to give it provisional names
-- provisional, because once you have reached it you will see that those
names were just utilitarian. They don't define and they don't confine
the experience. That's what master Fu meant when he said, we
provisionally establish empty names.</p><p>But if there is nobody, if master Fu is illusory and the people he is
concerned about -- the ones that may become afraid of annihilation --
don't exist, then what is the problem? Everything is solved: there is no
need of any preaching, there is no need of any scriptures, there is no
need of any meditation, there is no need to go beyond your anguish,
anxiety, misery. You yourself don't exist; how can you be miserable?
Have you ever heard of somebody who does not exist feeling very much
worried, someone who has never existed going through a migraine? The
very idea is so stupid.</p><p>Ta Hui's whole approach is to pick up all the great statements from
different masters, to compile them and give a fallacious impression to
people that he himself is enlightened. But enlightenment is far away. He
is living in a very deceptive state. He is deceiving others, but</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

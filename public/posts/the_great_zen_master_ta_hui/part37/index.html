And when the original tree was destroyed, just when India became free, a branch from Sri Lanka was brought back. It is a descendant that is now in the place where the original tree must have been.\nBuddhists were killed, burned alive. Those who could, escaped out of India, and that's how China became Buddhist, Korea became Buddhist, Taiwan became Buddhist, Japan became Buddhist, Burma became Buddhist, Thailand became Buddhist. The whole East turned towards Gautam Buddha, except his own land. India became absolutely without any influence of Gautam Buddha. The old priests came back, the VEDAS became again holy. Old, meaningless rituals again became significant.\nThere have been people in the world who could have transformed humanity, but there are so many parasites who would not like you to become enlightened because your enlightenment means their profession is destroyed.\nEnlightenment is the very essence of human dignity, human grandeur. It is certainly the key, as Ta Hui is saying. It is the golden key. And for anybody in the world who really wants to be religious, except enlightenment there is no other way.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n35\nDiscontinuity\n19 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO,\nA TALK TO THE ASSEMBLY (PART ONE)\nDO YOU WANT TO ATTAIN TRUE ONE SUCHNESS OF MIND AND OBJECTS? IT REQUIRES AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK: PICK OUT THE ONE INSIDE YOUR SKULL THAT'S DOING THE FALSE THINKING, TAKE THE EIGHTH CONSCIOUSNESS, AND CUT IT OFF WITH ONE BLOW.\nHAVEN'T YOU READ MASTER YEN T'OU'S SAYING? \"AS SOON AS THERE'S SOMETHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, IT BECOMES A NEST.\"\nALL OF YOU PEOPLE HAVE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIVES INQUIRING AFTER THIS MATTER -- WITHOUT ANY ATTAINMENT -- SITTING IN YOUR NESTS YOUR WHOLE LIVES WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COME OUT, TOTALLY UNAWARE OF YOUR ERROR. THOSE WHO'VE BECOME INFATUATED WITH THE WORDS AND PHRASES OF THE ANCIENTS TAKE AMAZING WORDS AND SUBTLE PHRASES AS THEIR NEST. THOSE WHO TAKE DELIGHT IN THE VERBAL MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURES TAKE THE SCRIPTURES AS THEIR NEST.\nALL THE ABOVE HAVE THINGS THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT WHERE THEIR INFATUATIONS LIE. LACKING THE QUALITIES OF GREAT MEN OF POWER TO STEP BACK AND RECOGNIZE THEIR ERROR, THEY THINK OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT AS EXTRAORDINARY, AS WONDROUS AND SUBTLE, AS PEACE AND SECURITY, AS THE ULTIMATE, AS LIBERATION.\nFOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS, EVEN IF BUDDHA APPEARED IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE TO NO AVAIL. WITH NOTHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, NATURALLY YOU'RE FULL OF RAWBONED POWER, WITHOUT DESIRE OR DEPENDENCE, AND MASTER OF THE DHARMA.\nEvery man creates a certain psychological security, unaware of the fact that his security is his prison. People are surrounded by all kinds of insecurities; hence the natural desire is to create a protection. This protection becomes bigger and bigger as you become more alert to the dangers you are living through. Your prison cell becomes smaller; you start living so much protected that life itself becomes impossible.\nLife is possible only in insecurity.\nThis is something very fundamental to be understood: life in its very essence is insecurity. While you are protecting yourself, you are destroying your very life. Protection is death, because only those who are dead in their graves are absolutely protected. Nobody can harm them, nothing can go wrong for them. There is no longer any death for them -- all that has happened. Now nothing more is going to happen.\nDo you want the security of a graveyard? Unknowingly that's what everybody is trying to do. Different are their ways, but the goal is the same. By money, by power, by prestige, by social conformity, by belonging to a herd -- religious, political -- by being part of a family, a nation, what are you seeking? Just an unknown fear surrounds you, and you start creating as many barriers as possible between you and the fear. But those same barriers are going to prevent you from living.\nOnce this is understood, you will know the meaning of sannyas. It is accepting life as insecurity, dropping all defenses and allowing life to take possession of you. This is a dangerous step, but those who are capable of taking it are rewarded immensely, because only they live. Others just survive.\nThere is a difference between survival and living. Survival is only a dragging -- dragging from the cradle to the grave. When is the grave going to come? In the space between the cradle and the grave, why be afraid? Death is certain -- and you don't have anything to lose, you come without anything. Your fears are just projections. You don't have anything to lose, and one day what you have is bound to disappear.\nIf death was uncertain there would be some substance in creating security. If you could avoid death, then naturally it would be perfectly right to create barriers between you and death. But you cannot avoid it. Ta Hui has said in his previous sutras, \"Accepting the unavoidable is one of the fundamentals of coming to illumination.\" Death is there; once accepted it loses all fear, nothing can be done about it. When nothing can be done about it, then why be bothered?\nIt is a well-known fact that soldiers going to the war field are trembling. Deep down they know that all will not be returning back in the evening. Who is going to return and who is not going to return is not known, but it is possible that perhaps they themselves may not be returning home. But psychologists have been observing a strange phenomenon: as they reach the war front, all their fears disappear. They start fighting very playfully.\nOnce death is accepted, then where is the sting in it? Once they know that death is possible at any moment -- then they can forget all about it.\nI have been with many army people -- I had many friends -- and it was strange to see that they are the most joyous people, the most relaxed. Any day the call can come, \"Join the forces\" -- but they play cards, they play golf, they drink, they dance, they enjoy life to the full.\nOne of the generals used to come to me. I asked him, \"You are prepared almost every day for death, and still ... how can you manage to be happy?\"\nHe said, \"What else is there to do? Death is certain.\"\nOnce the certainty, unavoidability, inescapability is accepted, then rather than crying and weeping and complaining and dragging yourself towards the grave, why not dance? Why not make the most of the time that you have between the cradle and the grave? Why not live every moment to such totality that if the next moment never comes, there is no complaint? You can die joyously because you have lived joyously.\nBut very few people have understood the inner working of their own psychology. Rather than living, they start protecting. The same energy that could have become a song and a dance becomes involved in creating more money, more power, more ambition, more security. The same energy that could have been a tremendously beautiful flower of love becomes just an imprisonment in a marriage. Marriage is secure -- by law, by social convention, by your own\nidea of respectability and what people will say. Everybody is afraid of everybody else ... so people go on pretending.\nLove disappears; it is not in your hands. It comes just like the breeze comes, and it goes just like the breeze goes. Those who are alert and aware dance with the breeze, relish it to its deepest potential, enjoy its coolness and fragrance, and when it is gone they are not sorry and sad. It was a gift from the unknown, it may come again. They wait ... it comes again and again. They learn slowly a deep patience and waiting.\nBut most human beings down the centuries have done the very opposite. Afraid that the breeze may go out, they close all the doors, all the windows, all possible cracks from where it can escape. This is their arrangement for security. This is called marriage. But now they are shocked. When all the windows and the doors are closed and they have plugged even small cracks, instead of having a great, cool, fragrant breeze they have only a stale dead air.\nEverybody feels it -- but it needs courage to recognize that they have destroyed the beauty of the breeze by capturing it. In life nothing can be captured and imprisoned. One has to live in openness, allowing all kinds of experiences to happen, being fully grateful as long as they last, thankful -- but not afraid of tomorrow.\nIf today has brought a beautiful morning, a beautiful sunrise, songs of birds, great flowers, why be worried about tomorrow? -- because tomorrow will be another today. Maybe the sunrise will have different colors, maybe the birds may change their songs a little, maybe there will be rainclouds and the dance of the rain -- but that has its own beauty, that has its own nourishment.\nIt is good that things go on changing, that every evening is not the same, that every day is not exactly a repetition. Something new ... that is the very excitement and ecstasy of life; otherwise man will be so bored. And those who have made their life completely secure are bored. They are bored with their wives, they are bored with their children, they are bored with their friends. Boredom is the experience of millions of people, although they smile to hide it.\nFriedrich Nietzsche is right when he says, \"Don't think I am a happy man. I smile just to prevent my tears. I become busy in smiling so I can prevent my tears. If I don't smile, tears are bound to come.\" Completely wrong attitudes have been taught to people: hide your tears, remain always at a distance, keep others at least at arm's length. Don't allow others too close, because then they may know your inner misery, your boredom, your anguish; they may know your sickness.\nThe whole humanity is sick for the simple reason that we have not allowed life's insecurity to be our very religion. Our gods are our security, our virtues are our security, our knowledge is our security, our relationships are our securities. We are wasting our whole life in accumulating security bonds. Our virtues, austerities, are nothing but an effort to be secure even after death. It is creating a bank balance in the other world.\nBut meanwhile a tremendously beautiful life is slipping out of your hands. The trees are so beautiful because they don't know the fear of insecurity. The wild animals have such grandeur because they don't know that there is death, there is insecurity. The flowers can dance in the sun and in the rain because they are not concerned about what is going to happen in the evening. Their petals will fall, and just as they had appeared from an unknown source, they will disappear back into the same unknown source. But meanwhile, between these two points of appearance and disappearance, you have the opportunity either to dance or to despair.\nTa Hui is saying that people go to the churches and to the temples and to the mosques, not because they are religious, but because they are cowards. Because they cannot live, they are finding ways to protect themselves.\nI used to stay with a friend in a house in Surat. This friend belongs to a strange Mohammedan sect, and Surat is their headquarters; their high priest lives in Surat. I could not believe what intelligent people can do ... the community is very rich and very intelligent; all are educated people. Just talking to him I came to know that in their society, when somebody dies, his friends and his family give money to the high priest. Sometimes lakhs of rupees are given to the priest as a representative of God; because the man is going on a pilgrimage, his life after death should be taken care of.\nThe priest writes a letter to God, a letter of recommendation: \"This man has to be taken care of. A good place\" -- according to the donations -- \"should be arranged for him in heaven.\" That letter is put in the pocket of the dead man, the dead man is put in the grave, and the money -- of course -- goes in the pocket of the priest.\nI asked the friend, \"Do you think that money in some strange way reaches to God?\" He said, \"That's the belief.\"\nI took him to their graveyard one night, to a new, fresh grave. We opened it, and he said, \"This is very sacrilegious.\"\nI said, \"I don't belong to your religion; don't be worried, all the responsibility is mine.\" And I pulled out the letter from the pocket of the dead man. I said, \"The letter is here. The fellow has forgotten to take the letter. Now what will he do?\" A character certificate ... in the twentieth century! We are still primitives.\nAnd the priest himself I have met. He is a well-educated person, he has a doctorate in literature. I told him, \"At least it is your responsibility, being an intelligent person, educated, not to lead people into false securities. People are giving their whole life's money to have a secure place in the other world, but they have not lived HERE.\"\nHe could not deny it to me: \"This is not good -- but I am just a representative of a long heritage. My father was a priest, my grandfather was a priest. It is our family profession.\"\nI said, \"It may be your family profession, but it is more of a crime than a profession. You are an intelligent man, you should expose this hypocrisy.\"\nBut he said, \"I have thought about it many times. As far as I'm concerned, I'm already too rich ... centuries of accumulation. I can expose it -- that the whole money goes into the pocket of the priest -- but I stop myself because this gives people great consolation and security. I don't want to disturb their consolation and their security.\"\nI can understand his concern and I don't think he was just trying to defend himself. He was sincere. But such are our consolations given in different ways by different religions, different priests, different politicians. Everybody is making your life secure -- and everybody is destroying you.\nAn authentic religious person simply drops the idea of security and starts living in utter insecurity, because that is the nature of life. You cannot change it. That which you cannot change, accept -- and accept it with joy. Don't unnecessarily hit your head against the wall; just pass through the door.\nTa Hui, in his last sutras, is giving you his standpoint. DO YOU WANT TO ATTAIN TRUE ONE SUCHNESS OF MIND AND OBJECTS? IT REQUIRES AN ABRUPT,\nCOMPLETE BREAK ... These are the words to be remembered: IT REQUIRES AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK. It requires a discontinuity of the way you have been living up to now. You have to stop living in ostrich logic.\nThe ostrich is a very logical animal. Whenever the ostrich sees any enemy, a hunter, he puts his head deep into the sand. Seeing no enemy, he feels completely secure. In fact, he has become more insecure. If he was looking at the enemy, then there would be possible ways to escape, or at least an effort could be made. But when he is standing there, his head in the sand, eyes closed, he is absolutely vulnerable.\nThis has become many people's lifestyle -- ostrich style. Whatever seems to be dangerous, they ignore it; they don't look that way. They believe that if they don't see it, it disappears.\nHave you ever consciously looked at death? Have you ever gone to the cemetery and sat there and thought about the people who are lying in their graves? No ... you will go only one time and one way -- you will not come back. Why are graveyards and cemeteries and funeral grounds made outside the city, out of the way? -- so that you don't have to come across them. In fact, the graveyards should be made exactly in the middle of the city, so you have to come across them many times every day, knowing perfectly well that the people who are sleeping in those graves were also one day living just like you, and one day you also will be lying in the same kind of grave.\nThe insecurity has to be made absolutely clear. In that clarity there is a possibility of acceptance; there is no other way. You cannot escape, so don't waste time in escaping.\nThe same time has to be used in coming to know a deeper life which knows no death, a deeper love which is not ephemeral, a love that has nothing to do with infatuation of any kind, a love that is just like a heartbeat to you, not addressed to anybody in particular. It is not loving someone, it is simply loving, it is being love -- that is eternal.\nBut an abrupt and complete break is needed in our lifestyles. Our lifestyles are based on cowardly, fearful attitudes towards life.\nPICK OUT THE ONE INSIDE YOUR SKULL THAT'S DOING THE FALSE THINKING, TAKE THE EIGHTH CONSCIOUSNESS, AND CUT IT OFF WITH ONE BLOW.\nBy AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK Tah Hui simply means that if you are intelligent enough, you will change in a single blow. You will not say, \"I will change gradually, slowly, part by part;\" you will not say, \"Change will take time.\" You will say, \"I have seen it; now there is no question of changing. I have changed.\"\nThere is a Buddhist story ... A woman is in deep love with Gautam Buddha's philosophy. She is a princess, and Gautam Buddha is in the town. She has just come from the discourse; she is full of the great ideas that Gautam Buddha was talking about. In ancient days in India it was customary ... it was a loving gesture but may have become, by and by, part of women's slavery. She was giving a shower to her husband, rubbing his body.\nShe said, \"By the way\" -- because her mind was still filled with Gautam Buddha. She said, \"My brother has been thinking to become a follower of Gautam Buddha.\"\nHer husband laughed. He said, \"That's ridiculous. Thinking? -- how many years has he been thinking?\"\nThe woman said, \"As far as I know, nearabout five years he has been thinking.\"\nThe man said, \"He will never become ... he will go on thinking. A person who can think for five years can think for fifty years.\"\nThese are not matters to be thought about; either you understand or you don't. These are abrupt quantum leaps. The moment you see the snake on the road you don't think whether to move away or to jump, you do something abruptly.\nWhen you see the house is on fire, you don't sit there for five years thinking about what to do. Once you have seen the house is on fire you don't even bother to put on your dress properly. If you are taking a shower, you will jump out of the bathroom window naked. This is not a time to follow social etiquette. It does not matter whether it is Poona or anywhere else -- when the house is on fire, you don't think of the police commissioner! The idea simply does not come to your mind.\nThe man said, \"Your brother is simply enjoying the idea that one day he will become a follower and perhaps attain the blissful state of buddhahood. But I can say to you it is not going to happen. These things happen abruptly.\"\nNaturally the wife was offended, because her brother has been criticized. To defend her brother she said to her husband, \"Can you do what you are saying? Can you do it abruptly? -- because you are also listening to Gautam Buddha.\"\nThe man did not answer; he simply jumped out of the bathroom window. The woman said, \"What are you doing?\"\nHe said, \"Forget all about it.\"\nShe said, \"At least take the clothes ...!\" He said, \"Abrupt means abrupt.\"\nPeople on the street could not believe that the prince was naked. They asked him, \"What has happened?\"\nHe said, \"I have become discontinuous with my past life!\"\nHe reached Gautam Buddha, naked. Gautam Buddha said, \"At least you could have put on some clothes.\"\nHe said, \"The situation was such that I had to do it abruptly. Initiate me this very moment!\"\nThe wife came running behind, the family came running behind, saying \"What are you doing? It was just a playful argument.\"\nThe man said, \"What I have done I cannot undo.\"\nAnd this man, because of his courage and a sudden understanding, became one of the enlightened disciples of Gautam Buddha. His name was Sariputta. He is one of the most loved characters in the Buddhist tradition. Certainly he was a man worthy to be loved and respected.\nTa Hui is suggesting to you also ... AN ABRUPT AND COMPLETE BREAK with your lifestyle, which is nothing but consolation, protection, security, safety, guarantee, insurance.\nHAVEN'T YOU READ MASTER YEN T'OU'S SAYING? \"AS SOON AS THERE'S SOMETHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, IT BECOMES A NEST.\" The moment you\nthink something is important -- money, knowledge, power -- it becomes a cozy nest, and you start living within that small nest. You become a prisoner.\nA man of ambition cannot be a free man. A man of desires cannot taste the beauty of freedom. His desires are his chains. And whatever has become important -- Yen T'ou is right\n-- that very thing becomes your bondage.\nNothing should be more important to you than your own consciousness. Anything more important than your consciousness makes a prison for you; you become secondary. You humiliate yourself, you yourself fall in your own eyes.\nALL OF YOU PEOPLE HAVE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIVES INQUIRING AFTER THIS MATTER -- WITHOUT ANY ATTAINMENT -- SITTING IN YOUR NESTS YOUR WHOLE LIVES WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COME OUT, TOTALLY UNAWARE OF YOUR ERROR.\nThe error is that you have made something more important than your own being, you have put something higher than yourself. It may be a god ... Don't put anything as a goal, don't put anything higher than you. You are the ultimate, nothing can be higher than you. You have to explore yourself, because the moment anything becomes important to you, you stop exploring yourself; you start running after that which is important to you, whatever it is.\nTHOSE WHO HAVE BECOME INFATUATED WITH THE WORDS AND PHRASES OF THE ANCIENTS TAKE AMAZING WORDS AND SUBTLE PHRASES AS THEIR\nNEST. What are your so-called learned people? -- the pundits, the rabbis, the great scholars. Words, beautiful words, have become so important to them that they have forgotten themselves. Words have become their whole life; they go on accumulating more and more beautiful quotes, statements, but what they are? -- just imprisoned in scriptures.\nTHOSE WHO TAKE DELIGHT IN THE VERBAL MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURES\nTAKE THE SCRIPTURES AS THEIR NEST. It does not matter what it is -- it may be money, it may even be enlightenment -- if you make it a distant goal, something to be achieved, you have missed the point. Enlightenment is not something to be achieved; it is something that happens to you when you are in a non-achieving mood, when there is nothing important to you, when there is no greed, no desire, no ambition -- not even the ambition for enlightenment. Then suddenly you settle within yourself, not going anywhere, because every desire is going away from you.\nWhen there is no going anywhere, your consciousness concentrates at the very center of your being ... and the explosion. This explosion is enlightenment, but you cannot make it a goal. This explosion is liberation, but you cannot make it a goal.\nALL THE ABOVE HAVE THINGS THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT WHERE THEIR INFATUATIONS LIE. LACKING THE QUALITIES OF GREAT MEN OF POWER TO STEP BACK AND RECOGNIZE THEIR ERROR, THEY THINK OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT AS EXTRAORDINARY, AS WONDROUS AND SUBTLE, AS PEACE AND SECURITY, AS THE ULTIMATE, AS LIBERATION.\nMan is a very self-deceiving animal; he can manage to deceive himself. He can call his imprisonment his palace, he can call his handcuffs his ornaments, he can call borrowed\nknowledge his experience. It is not a great crime to deceive somebody else, but to deceive oneself is certainly the greatest crime.\nOne who cannot deceive himself cannot deceive anybody else, and one who can deceive even himself is bound to deceive everybody.\nFOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS, EVEN IF BUDDHA\nAPPEARED IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE TO NO AVAIL. Those who are infatuated, running after certain projections of their mind, even if they meet Buddha they will not recognize him, because to recognize Buddha one needs an innocent mind, non-ambitious. You can recognize him only if you also have something of the same quality. If you don't have anything of alertness in you, how can you recognize the ultimate of awareness? You will bypass it.\nThousands of buddhas have happened and millions of people have passed them, without even looking back. They are so infatuated, their eyes are so full of their own greed that they cannot see clearly. And a buddha can be seen only if your eyes have no dust, if your mirror is clean.\nWITH NOTHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, NATURALLY YOU'RE FULL OF RAWBONED POWER, WITHOUT DESIRE OR DEPENDENCE, AND MASTER OF THE DHARMA.\nWith a very simple statement he has made a great invitation to you. You are the most important thing in existence; never put anything above you, otherwise that will become your bondage, your nest. Remain always clear that the greatest thing is throbbing in your own heart. It has to be explored, inquired into, experienced, but the Kohinoor is within you.\nThe moment your eyes become fixed on something else, you have reduced yourself into something secondary -- and you are primary.\nIt happened that I had to be present in a court because I had made a statement and somebody's religious feelings were hurt. I cannot conceive how anybody's religious feelings can be hurt; they must be very weak, they must not have deep foundations. And what I have said he had not even understood.\nI had related a small incident in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi used to listen to the Hindu scripture, RAMAYANA -- the story of Rama -- and Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was a Sanskrit scholar, used to read it. There comes a point in the story where Sita, the wife of Rama, is stolen, abducted by his enemy. Finding no other way, Sita used a small strategy to leave some marks on the path, so that Rama could find where the enemy has taken her; she started dropping her ornaments. She was a queen -- Rama was a king -- so she had many ornaments, immensely valuable, and she went on dropping them on the way.\nRama found the way, but there was trouble. His brother, Lakshmana, was with him. Rama said, \"I cannot recognize these ornaments.\" His argument was very clear; he said, \"You see ornaments only when the person is not worth seeing. Sita is so beautiful that when I see her I forget completely to see anything else, so I don't recognize these ornaments. Lakshmana, perhaps you can recognize them; you have always been following behind Sita.\"\nLakshmana said, \"You will have to forgive me. I can recognize only the ornaments she used to wear on her feet.\"\nThis is the incident: Mahatma Gandhi asked Bhave Vinoba, \"What is the matter? Why can't he recognize ...?\" And Vinoba Bhave gave the explanation that because Lakshmana was a celibate he could not look at Sita's face. But because the elder brother's wife is equal to the mother, Lakshmana had to touch Sita's feet every day -- in the morning -- so he could recognize the ornaments which were worn on her feet.\nMahatma Gandhi was very much impressed -- so much so that before this moment the word 'acharya' was not used for Vinoba Bhave. It was conferred by Mahatma Gandhi because of this incident, meaning \"You are a great teacher\" -- acharya means a great teacher -- \"I could not have thought about it this way, but you have a very deep insight.\"\nI was speaking in Ahmedabad and I said, \"Vinoba Bhave himself is a repressed person, trying to be celibate, otherwise I don't see any problem. Why can't you see a beautiful woman if you can see a beautiful flower, if you can see a beautiful moon? Beauty is not the problem; the problem is your repressed sexuality. You are afraid to see the face because you know that if you see the face you will be infatuated.\"\nAnd I said, \"Vinoba Bhave was wrong, and Mahatma Gandhi was wrong in accepting the explanation. The explanation is sick.\"\nMahatma Gandhi was dead. I told the court, \"I have not made any statement on my own. I have simply said that the statement of Vinoba Bhave shows his own psychology; it does not say anything about the incident. And if it says anything about the incident, then Lakshmana was also sexually repressed. And I'M not saying it; it is a simple conclusion from what Vinoba said. Vinoba is alive, and -- if the court agrees -- he should be called. I am ready to dispute on the point.\"\nBut the court was convinced: it is simple -- unless you are repressed you cannot be so afraid of seeing a woman who is almost your mother. And the man whose religious feelings were hurt ... The case was dismissed, but there were thousands of people surrounding the court. The man was so much afraid to come out of the court -- because people would have given him a good beating -- that he asked the judge for police protection.\nI said to the judge, \"I need police protection because I am hurting the feelings of the Hindus, and the people surrounding the court are all Hindus. Why should this man be afraid? Certainly he knows that he has brought the case only to harass me -- and the people are outside to take revenge.\"\nBut I said to the judge, \"Give him protection.\" And I said to the man, \"Remember, never let your religious feelings get so easily hurt.\"\nA religious man cannot feel hurt. Even if something is said against his religion, he will give it consideration: it may be right. If it is right, he will change; he will have the courage to change himself. If it is not right, who bothers? -- he will ignore it.\nWhy do religious people get easily hurt? There have been dozens of cases against me all over India in different courts for the same simple reason: somebody's religious feeling is hurt. Why do you go on carrying such religious feelings that get hurt so easily? These are not religions; these are their securities, their consolations. And because I have said something which takes away the consolation, the security ... that's what hurts.\nIt is as if I have taken away the protection which was hiding their wound. I have not created the wound, I have simply made them aware of it. They should be grateful to me, not\nangry, because if the wound is opened to the sun, to the air, there is a possibility of its being healed. But the very recognition is lacking that they are living in an imaginary security.\nI used to go to my town and I heard that my old teacher, who taught me in school and who loved me very much, was on his deathbed. So I ran to see him, but his wife said, \"Please don't disturb him. You have disturbed him so much; whenever you come he cannot sleep for a few nights. And this is a very critical moment: he is just on his deathbed.\"\nI said, \"Then I cannot go back. Let me disturb him for the last time! Because there is still time for him to understand.\" His fear always had been that I would destroy his securities. He used to worship a Hindu statue of Ganesha, the elephant god. I had said to him, \"Your statue of Ganesha seems more like a cartoon than a god. And can't you see that this seems to be some joke?\" The body is of a man, the head is of an elephant, and the belly is so big that Ganesha cannot see his own feet, and on top of it he is riding on a mouse! I said, \"Some practical joker must have made this, and you go on worshipping every day ...\"\nHe said, \"Don't disturb me! I'm an old man, and when you say such things they enter in my mind, then my worshipping is half-hearted, because I can see that it is right. This heavy man should not sit on the mouse; he could have found any other kind of vehicle. And such a big belly ...\"\nBut lifelong security ... because it is thought by the Hindus that Ganesh is a very protective god; in your difficulties he will be your savior. So when I pushed past his wife I said, \"You get out of the way. I have to see him.\"\nAnd as he saw me he closed his eyes. He said, \"Just forgive me, don't say anything. Let me die peacefully.\"\nI said, \"For that very purpose I have come. If you can drop all your nonsense you can die peacefully.\"\nHe said, \"You have started again! All that I have got is nonsense according to you, and I don't have any rational support for it. But it is not the time to argue; let me die believing in things I have always believed in. You have been distracting me continuously my whole life. I love you, and I know your intention is right, but on a poor old man you should show a little compassion.\"\nI said, \"That's what I have come for. I even had to push your wife out of the way. There is still time. If you can abruptly, in a single blow, drop all your beliefs, and without believing in anything die silently and peacefully, perhaps the last moments of your life will be the crescendo, the highest peak of consciousness. Don't miss these moments.\"\nBut you will not believe it: he closed his eyes, he closed his ears also. He was not ready to listen to me, because this is the moment to invoke God's help -- death is standing by the side of the bed.\nPeople are living their whole lives in psychological prisons. The authentic religious revolution is an abrupt jump out of your prison cell. Nobody is blocking the way. You are the maker of it, and if you are courageous enough, you can jump out of it.\nTo know life in its insecurity is to know life in its immense beauty, is to know life in its authenticity. To know life in its insecurity, without any fear, is to transcend death, because life never dies.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5985","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part37/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">35 Discontinuity</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5985 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part37.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part36>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT
REQUIRES AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK: PICK OUT THE ONE INSIDE YOUR SKULL
THAT'S DOING THE FALSE THINKING, TAKE THE EIGHTH CONSCIOUSNESS, AND CUT
IT OFF WITH ONE BLOW.</p><p>HAVEN'T YOU READ MASTER YEN T'OU'S SAYING? "AS SOON AS THERE'S
SOMETHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, IT BECOMES A NEST."</p><p>ALL OF YOU PEOPLE HAVE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIVES INQUIRING AFTER THIS
MATTER -- WITHOUT ANY ATTAINMENT -- SITTING IN YOUR NESTS YOUR WHOLE
LIVES WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COME OUT, TOTALLY UNAWARE OF YOUR ERROR.
THOSE WHO'VE BECOME INFATUATED WITH THE WORDS AND PHRASES OF THE
ANCIENTS TAKE AMAZING WORDS AND SUBTLE PHRASES AS THEIR NEST. THOSE WHO
TAKE DELIGHT IN THE VERBAL MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURES TAKE THE SCRIPTURES
AS THEIR NEST.</p><p>ALL THE ABOVE HAVE THINGS THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT WHERE THEIR
INFATUATIONS LIE. LACKING THE QUALITIES OF GREAT MEN OF POWER TO STEP
BACK AND RECOGNIZE THEIR ERROR, THEY THINK OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER
IMPORTANT AS EXTRAORDINARY, AS WONDROUS AND SUBTLE, AS PEACE AND
SECURITY, AS THE ULTIMATE, AS LIBERATION.</p><p>FOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS, EVEN IF BUDDHA APPEARED IN THE
WORLD, IT WOULD BE TO NO AVAIL. WITH NOTHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT,
NATURALLY YOU'RE FULL OF RAWBONED POWER, WITHOUT DESIRE OR DEPENDENCE,
AND MASTER OF THE DHARMA.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man creates a certain psychological security, unaware of the
fact that his security is his prison. People are surrounded by all kinds
of insecurities; hence the natural desire is to create a protection.
This protection becomes bigger and bigger as you become more alert to
the dangers you are living through. Your prison cell becomes smaller;
you start living so much protected that life itself becomes
impossible.</p><p>Life is possible only in insecurity.</p><p>This is something very fundamental to be understood: life in its very
essence is insecurity. While you are protecting yourself, you are
destroying your very life. Protection is death, because only those who
are dead in their graves are absolutely protected. Nobody can harm them,
nothing can go wrong for them. There is no longer any death for them --
all that has happened. Now nothing more is going to happen.</p><p>Do you want the security of a graveyard? Unknowingly that's what
everybody is trying to do. Different are their ways, but the goal is the
same. By money, by power, by prestige, by social conformity, by
belonging to a herd -- religious, political -- by being part of a
family, a nation, what are you seeking? Just an unknown fear surrounds
you, and you start creating as many barriers as possible between you and
the fear. But those same barriers are going to prevent you from
living.</p><p>Once this is understood, you will know the meaning of sannyas. It is
accepting life as insecurity, dropping all defenses and allowing life to
take possession of you. This is a dangerous step, but those who are
capable of taking it are rewarded immensely, because only they live.
Others just survive.</p><p>There is a difference between survival and living. Survival is only a
dragging -- dragging from the cradle to the grave. When is the grave
going to come? In the space between the cradle and the grave, why be
afraid? Death is certain -- and you don't have anything to lose, you
come without anything. Your fears are just projections. You don't have
anything to lose, and one day what you have is bound to disappear.</p><p>If death was uncertain there would be some substance in creating
security. If you could avoid death, then naturally it would be perfectly
right to create barriers between you and death. But you cannot avoid it.
Ta Hui has said in his previous sutras, "Accepting the unavoidable is
one of the fundamentals of coming to illumination." Death is there; once
accepted it loses all fear, nothing can be done about it. When nothing
can be done about it, then why be bothered?</p><p>It is a well-known fact that soldiers going to the war field are
trembling. Deep down they know that all will not be returning back in
the evening. Who is going to return and who is not going to return is
not known, but it is possible that perhaps they themselves may not be
returning home. But psychologists have been observing a strange
phenomenon: as they reach the war front, all their fears disappear. They
start fighting very playfully.</p><p>Once death is accepted, then where is the sting in it? Once they know
that death is possible at any moment -- then they can forget all about
it.</p><p>I have been with many army people -- I had many friends -- and it was
strange to see that they are the most joyous people, the most relaxed.
Any day the call can come, "Join the forces" -- but they play cards,
they play golf, they drink, they dance, they enjoy life to the full.</p><p>One of the generals used to come to me. I asked him, "You are
prepared almost every day for death, and still ... how can you manage to
be happy?"</p><p>He said, "What else is there to do? Death is certain."</p><p>Once the certainty, unavoidability, inescapability is accepted, then
rather than crying and weeping and complaining and dragging yourself
towards the grave, why not dance? Why not make the most of the time that
you have between the cradle and the grave? Why not live every moment to
such totality that if the next moment never comes, there is no
complaint? You can die joyously because you have lived joyously.</p><p>But very few people have understood the inner working of their own
psychology. Rather than living, they start protecting. The same energy
that could have become a song and a dance becomes involved in creating
more money, more power, more ambition, more security. The same energy
that could have been a tremendously beautiful flower of love becomes
just an imprisonment in a marriage. Marriage is secure -- by law, by
social convention, by your own</p><p>idea of respectability and what people will say. Everybody is afraid
of everybody else ... so people go on pretending.</p><p>Love disappears; it is not in your hands. It comes just like the
breeze comes, and it goes just like the breeze goes. Those who are alert
and aware dance with the breeze, relish it to its deepest potential,
enjoy its coolness and fragrance, and when it is gone they are not sorry
and sad. It was a gift from the unknown, it may come again. They wait
... it comes again and again. They learn slowly a deep patience and
waiting.</p><p>But most human beings down the centuries have done the very opposite.
Afraid that the breeze may go out, they close all the doors, all the
windows, all possible cracks from where it can escape. This is their
arrangement for security. This is called marriage. But now they are
shocked. When all the windows and the doors are closed and they have
plugged even small cracks, instead of having a great, cool, fragrant
breeze they have only a stale dead air.</p><p>Everybody feels it -- but it needs courage to recognize that they
have destroyed the beauty of the breeze by capturing it. In life nothing
can be captured and imprisoned. One has to live in openness, allowing
all kinds of experiences to happen, being fully grateful as long as they
last, thankful -- but not afraid of tomorrow.</p><p>If today has brought a beautiful morning, a beautiful sunrise, songs
of birds, great flowers, why be worried about tomorrow? -- because
tomorrow will be another today. Maybe the sunrise will have different
colors, maybe the birds may change their songs a little, maybe there
will be rainclouds and the dance of the rain -- but that has its own
beauty, that has its own nourishment.</p><p>It is good that things go on changing, that every evening is not the
same, that every day is not exactly a repetition. Something new ... that
is the very excitement and ecstasy of life; otherwise man will be so
bored. And those who have made their life completely secure are bored.
They are bored with their wives, they are bored with their children,
they are bored with their friends. Boredom is the experience of millions
of people, although they smile to hide it.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche is right when he says, "Don't think I am a happy
man. I smile just to prevent my tears. I become busy in smiling so I can
prevent my tears. If I don't smile, tears are bound to come." Completely
wrong attitudes have been taught to people: hide your tears, remain
always at a distance, keep others at least at arm's length. Don't allow
others too close, because then they may know your inner misery, your
boredom, your anguish; they may know your sickness.</p><p>The whole humanity is sick for the simple reason that we have not
allowed life's insecurity to be our very religion. Our gods are our
security, our virtues are our security, our knowledge is our security,
our relationships are our securities. We are wasting our whole life in
accumulating security bonds. Our virtues, austerities, are nothing but
an effort to be secure even after death. It is creating a bank balance
in the other world.</p><p>But meanwhile a tremendously beautiful life is slipping out of your
hands. The trees are so beautiful because they don't know the fear of
insecurity. The wild animals have such grandeur because they don't know
that there is death, there is insecurity. The flowers can dance in the
sun and in the rain because they are not concerned about what is going
to happen in the evening. Their petals will fall, and just as they had
appeared from an unknown source, they will disappear back into the same
unknown source. But meanwhile, between these two points of appearance
and disappearance, you have the opportunity either to dance or to
despair.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying that people go to the churches and to the temples
and to the mosques, not because they are religious, but because they are
cowards. Because they cannot live, they are finding ways to protect
themselves.</p><p>I used to stay with a friend in a house in Surat. This friend belongs
to a strange Mohammedan sect, and Surat is their headquarters; their
high priest lives in Surat. I could not believe what intelligent people
can do ... the community is very rich and very intelligent; all are
educated people. Just talking to him I came to know that in their
society, when somebody dies, his friends and his family give money to
the high priest. Sometimes lakhs of rupees are given to the priest as a
representative of God; because the man is going on a pilgrimage, his
life after death should be taken care of.</p><p>The priest writes a letter to God, a letter of recommendation: "This
man has to be taken care of. A good place" -- according to the donations
-- "should be arranged for him in heaven." That letter is put in the
pocket of the dead man, the dead man is put in the grave, and the money
-- of course -- goes in the pocket of the priest.</p><p>I asked the friend, "Do you think that money in some strange way
reaches to God?" He said, "That's the belief."</p><p>I took him to their graveyard one night, to a new, fresh grave. We
opened it, and he said, "This is very sacrilegious."</p><p>I said, "I don't belong to your religion; don't be worried, all the
responsibility is mine." And I pulled out the letter from the pocket of
the dead man. I said, "The letter is here. The fellow has forgotten to
take the letter. Now what will he do?" A character certificate ... in
the twentieth century! We are still primitives.</p><p>And the priest himself I have met. He is a well-educated person, he
has a doctorate in literature. I told him, "At least it is your
responsibility, being an intelligent person, educated, not to lead
people into false securities. People are giving their whole life's money
to have a secure place in the other world, but they have not lived
HERE."</p><p>He could not deny it to me: "This is not good -- but I am just a
representative of a long heritage. My father was a priest, my
grandfather was a priest. It is our family profession."</p><p>I said, "It may be your family profession, but it is more of a crime
than a profession. You are an intelligent man, you should expose this
hypocrisy."</p><p>But he said, "I have thought about it many times. As far as I'm
concerned, I'm already too rich ... centuries of accumulation. I can
expose it -- that the whole money goes into the pocket of the priest --
but I stop myself because this gives people great consolation and
security. I don't want to disturb their consolation and their
security."</p><p>I can understand his concern and I don't think he was just trying to
defend himself. He was sincere. But such are our consolations given in
different ways by different religions, different priests, different
politicians. Everybody is making your life secure -- and everybody is
destroying you.</p><p>An authentic religious person simply drops the idea of security and
starts living in utter insecurity, because that is the nature of life.
You cannot change it. That which you cannot change, accept -- and accept
it with joy. Don't unnecessarily hit your head against the wall; just
pass through the door.</p><p>Ta Hui, in his last sutras, is giving you his standpoint. DO YOU WANT
TO ATTAIN TRUE ONE SUCHNESS OF MIND AND OBJECTS? IT REQUIRES AN
ABRUPT,</p><p>COMPLETE BREAK ... These are the words to be remembered: IT REQUIRES
AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK. It requires a discontinuity of the way you
have been living up to now. You have to stop living in ostrich
logic.</p><p>The ostrich is a very logical animal. Whenever the ostrich sees any
enemy, a hunter, he puts his head deep into the sand. Seeing no enemy,
he feels completely secure. In fact, he has become more insecure. If he
was looking at the enemy, then there would be possible ways to escape,
or at least an effort could be made. But when he is standing there, his
head in the sand, eyes closed, he is absolutely vulnerable.</p><p>This has become many people's lifestyle -- ostrich style. Whatever
seems to be dangerous, they ignore it; they don't look that way. They
believe that if they don't see it, it disappears.</p><p>Have you ever consciously looked at death? Have you ever gone to the
cemetery and sat there and thought about the people who are lying in
their graves? No ... you will go only one time and one way -- you will
not come back. Why are graveyards and cemeteries and funeral grounds
made outside the city, out of the way? -- so that you don't have to come
across them. In fact, the graveyards should be made exactly in the
middle of the city, so you have to come across them many times every
day, knowing perfectly well that the people who are sleeping in those
graves were also one day living just like you, and one day you also will
be lying in the same kind of grave.</p><p>The insecurity has to be made absolutely clear. In that clarity there
is a possibility of acceptance; there is no other way. You cannot
escape, so don't waste time in escaping.</p><p>The same time has to be used in coming to know a deeper life which
knows no death, a deeper love which is not ephemeral, a love that has
nothing to do with infatuation of any kind, a love that is just like a
heartbeat to you, not addressed to anybody in particular. It is not
loving someone, it is simply loving, it is being love -- that is
eternal.</p><p>But an abrupt and complete break is needed in our lifestyles. Our
lifestyles are based on cowardly, fearful attitudes towards life.</p><p>PICK OUT THE ONE INSIDE YOUR SKULL THAT'S DOING THE FALSE THINKING,
TAKE THE EIGHTH CONSCIOUSNESS, AND CUT IT OFF WITH ONE BLOW.</p><p>By AN ABRUPT, COMPLETE BREAK Tah Hui simply means that if you are
intelligent enough, you will change in a single blow. You will not say,
"I will change gradually, slowly, part by part;" you will not say,
"Change will take time." You will say, "I have seen it; now there is no
question of changing. I have changed."</p><p>There is a Buddhist story ... A woman is in deep love with Gautam
Buddha's philosophy. She is a princess, and Gautam Buddha is in the
town. She has just come from the discourse; she is full of the great
ideas that Gautam Buddha was talking about. In ancient days in India it
was customary ... it was a loving gesture but may have become, by and
by, part of women's slavery. She was giving a shower to her husband,
rubbing his body.</p><p>She said, "By the way" -- because her mind was still filled with
Gautam Buddha. She said, "My brother has been thinking to become a
follower of Gautam Buddha."</p><p>Her husband laughed. He said, "That's ridiculous. Thinking? -- how
many years has he been thinking?"</p><p>The woman said, "As far as I know, nearabout five years he has been
thinking."</p><p>The man said, "He will never become ... he will go on thinking. A
person who can think for five years can think for fifty years."</p><p>These are not matters to be thought about; either you understand or
you don't. These are abrupt quantum leaps. The moment you see the snake
on the road you don't think whether to move away or to jump, you do
something abruptly.</p><p>When you see the house is on fire, you don't sit there for five years
thinking about what to do. Once you have seen the house is on fire you
don't even bother to put on your dress properly. If you are taking a
shower, you will jump out of the bathroom window naked. This is not a
time to follow social etiquette. It does not matter whether it is Poona
or anywhere else -- when the house is on fire, you don't think of the
police commissioner! The idea simply does not come to your mind.</p><p>The man said, "Your brother is simply enjoying the idea that one day
he will become a follower and perhaps attain the blissful state of
buddhahood. But I can say to you it is not going to happen. These things
happen abruptly."</p><p>Naturally the wife was offended, because her brother has been
criticized. To defend her brother she said to her husband, "Can you do
what you are saying? Can you do it abruptly? -- because you are also
listening to Gautam Buddha."</p><p>The man did not answer; he simply jumped out of the bathroom window.
The woman said, "What are you doing?"</p><p>He said, "Forget all about it."</p><p>She said, "At least take the clothes ...!" He said, "Abrupt means
abrupt."</p><p>People on the street could not believe that the prince was naked.
They asked him, "What has happened?"</p><p>He said, "I have become discontinuous with my past life!"</p><p>He reached Gautam Buddha, naked. Gautam Buddha said, "At least you
could have put on some clothes."</p><p>He said, "The situation was such that I had to do it abruptly.
Initiate me this very moment!"</p><p>The wife came running behind, the family came running behind, saying
"What are you doing? It was just a playful argument."</p><p>The man said, "What I have done I cannot undo."</p><p>And this man, because of his courage and a sudden understanding,
became one of the enlightened disciples of Gautam Buddha. His name was
Sariputta. He is one of the most loved characters in the Buddhist
tradition. Certainly he was a man worthy to be loved and respected.</p><p>Ta Hui is suggesting to you also ... AN ABRUPT AND COMPLETE BREAK
with your lifestyle, which is nothing but consolation, protection,
security, safety, guarantee, insurance.</p><p>HAVEN'T YOU READ MASTER YEN T'OU'S SAYING? "AS SOON AS THERE'S
SOMETHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, IT BECOMES A NEST." The moment you</p><p>think something is important -- money, knowledge, power -- it becomes
a cozy nest, and you start living within that small nest. You become a
prisoner.</p><p>A man of ambition cannot be a free man. A man of desires cannot taste
the beauty of freedom. His desires are his chains. And whatever has
become important -- Yen T'ou is right</p><p>-- that very thing becomes your bondage.</p><p>Nothing should be more important to you than your own consciousness.
Anything more important than your consciousness makes a prison for you;
you become secondary. You humiliate yourself, you yourself fall in your
own eyes.</p><p>ALL OF YOU PEOPLE HAVE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIVES INQUIRING AFTER THIS
MATTER -- WITHOUT ANY ATTAINMENT -- SITTING IN YOUR NESTS YOUR WHOLE
LIVES WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COME OUT, TOTALLY UNAWARE OF YOUR ERROR.</p><p>The error is that you have made something more important than your
own being, you have put something higher than yourself. It may be a god
... Don't put anything as a goal, don't put anything higher than you.
You are the ultimate, nothing can be higher than you. You have to
explore yourself, because the moment anything becomes important to you,
you stop exploring yourself; you start running after that which is
important to you, whatever it is.</p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE BECOME INFATUATED WITH THE WORDS AND PHRASES OF THE
ANCIENTS TAKE AMAZING WORDS AND SUBTLE PHRASES AS THEIR</p><p>NEST. What are your so-called learned people? -- the pundits, the
rabbis, the great scholars. Words, beautiful words, have become so
important to them that they have forgotten themselves. Words have become
their whole life; they go on accumulating more and more beautiful
quotes, statements, but what they are? -- just imprisoned in
scriptures.</p><p>THOSE WHO TAKE DELIGHT IN THE VERBAL MEANING OF THE SCRIPTURES</p><p>TAKE THE SCRIPTURES AS THEIR NEST. It does not matter what it is --
it may be money, it may even be enlightenment -- if you make it a
distant goal, something to be achieved, you have missed the point.
Enlightenment is not something to be achieved; it is something that
happens to you when you are in a non-achieving mood, when there is
nothing important to you, when there is no greed, no desire, no ambition
-- not even the ambition for enlightenment. Then suddenly you settle
within yourself, not going anywhere, because every desire is going away
from you.</p><p>When there is no going anywhere, your consciousness concentrates at
the very center of your being ... and the explosion. This explosion is
enlightenment, but you cannot make it a goal. This explosion is
liberation, but you cannot make it a goal.</p><p>ALL THE ABOVE HAVE THINGS THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT WHERE THEIR
INFATUATIONS LIE. LACKING THE QUALITIES OF GREAT MEN OF POWER TO STEP
BACK AND RECOGNIZE THEIR ERROR, THEY THINK OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER
IMPORTANT AS EXTRAORDINARY, AS WONDROUS AND SUBTLE, AS PEACE AND
SECURITY, AS THE ULTIMATE, AS LIBERATION.</p><p>Man is a very self-deceiving animal; he can manage to deceive
himself. He can call his imprisonment his palace, he can call his
handcuffs his ornaments, he can call borrowed</p><p>knowledge his experience. It is not a great crime to deceive somebody
else, but to deceive oneself is certainly the greatest crime.</p><p>One who cannot deceive himself cannot deceive anybody else, and one
who can deceive even himself is bound to deceive everybody.</p><p>FOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS, EVEN IF BUDDHA</p><p>APPEARED IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE TO NO AVAIL. Those who are
infatuated, running after certain projections of their mind, even if
they meet Buddha they will not recognize him, because to recognize
Buddha one needs an innocent mind, non-ambitious. You can recognize him
only if you also have something of the same quality. If you don't have
anything of alertness in you, how can you recognize the ultimate of
awareness? You will bypass it.</p><p>Thousands of buddhas have happened and millions of people have passed
them, without even looking back. They are so infatuated, their eyes are
so full of their own greed that they cannot see clearly. And a buddha
can be seen only if your eyes have no dust, if your mirror is clean.</p><p>WITH NOTHING CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, NATURALLY YOU'RE FULL OF RAWBONED
POWER, WITHOUT DESIRE OR DEPENDENCE, AND MASTER OF THE DHARMA.</p><p>With a very simple statement he has made a great invitation to you.
You are the most important thing in existence; never put anything above
you, otherwise that will become your bondage, your nest. Remain always
clear that the greatest thing is throbbing in your own heart. It has to
be explored, inquired into, experienced, but the Kohinoor is within
you.</p><p>The moment your eyes become fixed on something else, you have reduced
yourself into something secondary -- and you are primary.</p><p>It happened that I had to be present in a court because I had made a
statement and somebody's religious feelings were hurt. I cannot conceive
how anybody's religious feelings can be hurt; they must be very weak,
they must not have deep foundations. And what I have said he had not
even understood.</p><p>I had related a small incident in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma
Gandhi used to listen to the Hindu scripture, RAMAYANA -- the story of
Rama -- and Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was a Sanskrit scholar, used to
read it. There comes a point in the story where Sita, the wife of Rama,
is stolen, abducted by his enemy. Finding no other way, Sita used a
small strategy to leave some marks on the path, so that Rama could find
where the enemy has taken her; she started dropping her ornaments. She
was a queen -- Rama was a king -- so she had many ornaments, immensely
valuable, and she went on dropping them on the way.</p><p>Rama found the way, but there was trouble. His brother, Lakshmana,
was with him. Rama said, "I cannot recognize these ornaments." His
argument was very clear; he said, "You see ornaments only when the
person is not worth seeing. Sita is so beautiful that when I see her I
forget completely to see anything else, so I don't recognize these
ornaments. Lakshmana, perhaps you can recognize them; you have always
been following behind Sita."</p><p>Lakshmana said, "You will have to forgive me. I can recognize only
the ornaments she used to wear on her feet."</p><p>This is the incident: Mahatma Gandhi asked Bhave Vinoba, "What is the
matter? Why can't he recognize ...?" And Vinoba Bhave gave the
explanation that because Lakshmana was a celibate he could not look at
Sita's face. But because the elder brother's wife is equal to the
mother, Lakshmana had to touch Sita's feet every day -- in the morning
-- so he could recognize the ornaments which were worn on her feet.</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi was very much impressed -- so much so that before this
moment the word 'acharya' was not used for Vinoba Bhave. It was
conferred by Mahatma Gandhi because of this incident, meaning "You are a
great teacher" -- acharya means a great teacher -- "I could not have
thought about it this way, but you have a very deep insight."</p><p>I was speaking in Ahmedabad and I said, "Vinoba Bhave himself is a
repressed person, trying to be celibate, otherwise I don't see any
problem. Why can't you see a beautiful woman if you can see a beautiful
flower, if you can see a beautiful moon? Beauty is not the problem; the
problem is your repressed sexuality. You are afraid to see the face
because you know that if you see the face you will be infatuated."</p><p>And I said, "Vinoba Bhave was wrong, and Mahatma Gandhi was wrong in
accepting the explanation. The explanation is sick."</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi was dead. I told the court, "I have not made any
statement on my own. I have simply said that the statement of Vinoba
Bhave shows his own psychology; it does not say anything about the
incident. And if it says anything about the incident, then Lakshmana was
also sexually repressed. And I'M not saying it; it is a simple
conclusion from what Vinoba said. Vinoba is alive, and -- if the court
agrees -- he should be called. I am ready to dispute on the point."</p><p>But the court was convinced: it is simple -- unless you are repressed
you cannot be so afraid of seeing a woman who is almost your mother. And
the man whose religious feelings were hurt ... The case was dismissed,
but there were thousands of people surrounding the court. The man was so
much afraid to come out of the court -- because people would have given
him a good beating -- that he asked the judge for police protection.</p><p>I said to the judge, "I need police protection because I am hurting
the feelings of the Hindus, and the people surrounding the court are all
Hindus. Why should this man be afraid? Certainly he knows that he has
brought the case only to harass me -- and the people are outside to take
revenge."</p><p>But I said to the judge, "Give him protection." And I said to the
man, "Remember, never let your religious feelings get so easily
hurt."</p><p>A religious man cannot feel hurt. Even if something is said against
his religion, he will give it consideration: it may be right. If it is
right, he will change; he will have the courage to change himself. If it
is not right, who bothers? -- he will ignore it.</p><p>Why do religious people get easily hurt? There have been dozens of
cases against me all over India in different courts for the same simple
reason: somebody's religious feeling is hurt. Why do you go on carrying
such religious feelings that get hurt so easily? These are not
religions; these are their securities, their consolations. And because I
have said something which takes away the consolation, the security ...
that's what hurts.</p><p>It is as if I have taken away the protection which was hiding their
wound. I have not created the wound, I have simply made them aware of
it. They should be grateful to me, not</p><p>angry, because if the wound is opened to the sun, to the air, there
is a possibility of its being healed. But the very recognition is
lacking that they are living in an imaginary security.</p><p>I used to go to my town and I heard that my old teacher, who taught
me in school and who loved me very much, was on his deathbed. So I ran
to see him, but his wife said, "Please don't disturb him. You have
disturbed him so much; whenever you come he cannot sleep for a few
nights. And this is a very critical moment: he is just on his
deathbed."</p><p>I said, "Then I cannot go back. Let me disturb him for the last time!
Because there is still time for him to understand." His fear always had
been that I would destroy his securities. He used to worship a Hindu
statue of Ganesha, the elephant god. I had said to him, "Your statue of
Ganesha seems more like a cartoon than a god. And can't you see that
this seems to be some joke?" The body is of a man, the head is of an
elephant, and the belly is so big that Ganesha cannot see his own feet,
and on top of it he is riding on a mouse! I said, "Some practical joker
must have made this, and you go on worshipping every day ..."</p><p>He said, "Don't disturb me! I'm an old man, and when you say such
things they enter in my mind, then my worshipping is half-hearted,
because I can see that it is right. This heavy man should not sit on the
mouse; he could have found any other kind of vehicle. And such a big
belly ..."</p><p>But lifelong security ... because it is thought by the Hindus that
Ganesh is a very protective god; in your difficulties he will be your
savior. So when I pushed past his wife I said, "You get out of the way.
I have to see him."</p><p>And as he saw me he closed his eyes. He said, "Just forgive me, don't
say anything. Let me die peacefully."</p><p>I said, "For that very purpose I have come. If you can drop all your
nonsense you can die peacefully."</p><p>He said, "You have started again! All that I have got is nonsense
according to you, and I don't have any rational support for it. But it
is not the time to argue; let me die believing in things I have always
believed in. You have been distracting me continuously my whole life. I
love you, and I know your intention is right, but on a poor old man you
should show a little compassion."</p><p>I said, "That's what I have come for. I even had to push your wife
out of the way. There is still time. If you can abruptly, in a single
blow, drop all your beliefs, and without believing in anything die
silently and peacefully, perhaps the last moments of your life will be
the crescendo, the highest peak of consciousness. Don't miss these
moments."</p><p>But you will not believe it: he closed his eyes, he closed his ears
also. He was not ready to listen to me, because this is the moment to
invoke God's help -- death is standing by the side of the bed.</p><p>People are living their whole lives in psychological prisons. The
authentic religious revolution is an abrupt jump out of your prison
cell. Nobody is blocking the way. You are the maker of it, and if you
are courageous enough, you can jump out of it.</p><p>To know life in its insecurity is to know life in its immense beauty,
is to know life in its authenticity. To know life in its insecurity,
without any fear, is to transcend death, because life never dies.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part36>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

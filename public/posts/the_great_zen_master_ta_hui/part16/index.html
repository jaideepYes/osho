Calling Buddha a barbarian, sooner or later he must have realized that that was going too far -- and it was too ugly.\nI hope that he will come back. Even if he can come back at the last moment of his death, everything else can be forgiven. It is human to forgive ... The ancient saying is, \"It is human to err and it is divine to forgive.\" I want a little change in it: \"It is human to err, it is more human to forgive.\" Why bring in the divine unnecessarily? The scientific mind always tries to have as few hypotheses as possible.\nManeesha had asked last night, seeing that Ta Hui has not proved a great treasure of enlightenment, \"We can finish the discourses on Ta Hui tonight ...\"\nI said; \"No, because that will be an injustice. I have hammered him. If he can come back home I would like to appreciate him also; so I will go through all the sutras.\nI don't know what is going to happen in them. But a man, even though he may be an intellectual ... if he continues, sooner or later he is going to recognize that he is going round and round in a circle. There is much more than this continuous circle, but that much more can be seen only if you stand out of the circle as a witness. And I think he is capable -- because everybody is capable. It is only a question of when you turn inwards, only a question of when you drop your pretensions and hypocrisies.\nSo I will wait for two weeks -- she says there will be sutras for two weeks more. If he goes astray, he will get hit. But my feeling is, a man who is interested may realize at some point that what he is doing is only intellectual gymnastics -- and that may prove a turning point in his life. If it happens, then this whole series on Ta Hui will be of immense significance, because it will be the story of any man -- wandering, going astray, coming back to the path and then falling again and again, but at the end, finally he becomes a light unto himself.\nI will also feel at ease, because I don't like to hit anybody. If I can see him coming back with the insight of enlightenment as his own experience, I will also feel good: 'The man was worth hitting. You were not hitting just an ordinary idiot -- he was extraordinary!\"\nI don't know what is going to happen in these two weeks. It all depends on Ta Hui -- how many times he is going to go astray, and whether he has the potential to realize, or he dies without realization.\nIt will be a sad affair if he dies without enlightenment. I would like it to be a celebration ... and my hope is that the man is capable.\nAny moment the turning point can come, and any moment his inner flame can burn bright.\nSo you will have to tolerate Ta Hui for at least two weeks more.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n14\nClarity\n21 July 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO, PROFOUND CLARITY\nI AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN, \"PROFOUND CLARITY\". A PATRIARCH SAID, \"AS LONG AS THERE IS MENTAL DISCRIMINATION, AND CALCULATING JUDGMENT, ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF ONE'S OWN MIND ARE DREAMS. IF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE QUIESCENT AND EXTINCT, WITHOUT A SINGLE THOUGHT STIRRING, THIS IS CALLED CORRECT AWARENESS.\"\nTHESE DAYS THERE'S A KIND OF PHONY, WHOSE OWN STANDPOINT IS NOT GENUINE: THEY JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR MINDS AND SIT QUIETLY, TO SIT TO THE POINT WHERE THE BREATH CEASES. I CALL THIS LOT PITIABLE. I'M ASKING YOU TO MEDITATE IN JUST THIS WAY, BUT THOUGH I INSTRUCT YOU LIKE THIS, IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE ...\nBEGINNERS' DISEASE\nBUDDHIST DISCIPLE CH'EN, YOU HAVE REALIZED THAT PERSONAL EXISTENCE IS FALSE, AND THAT THINGS ARE ILLUSORY. AMIDST ILLUSORY FALSEHOOD YOU WERE ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE THE SAYING \"A DOG HAS NO BUDDHA-NATURE\" -- YOU SENT ME A LETTER EXPRESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THOUGH IN THE MAIN YOUR BASIS IS ALREADY CORRECT, YOU ARE NOT YET CLEAR ABOUT THE GREAT DHARMA -- THIS IS A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH.\nOLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, \"THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT'S ALL ALL RIGHT.\" JUST GET THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES. OVER A LONG LONG TIME IT WILL SINK IN THOROUGHLY: DON'T WORRY THAT YOU WON'T ATTAIN ONENESS. WORK ON IT!\nI can see the difficulties Ta Hui is passing through. He can intellectually understand the path of awareness, he can also intellectually explain it to others -- but he himself still remains only a philosopher. He has not transformed himself into a mystic.\nThe philosopher talks about truth. The mystic is truth.\nAnd there is a profound difference between talking about it and being it.\nCertainly the people who have reached to the point of being truth itself also can talk, but their words vibrate on a totally different level, and it can be seen very clearly that they are not coming from the mind.\nThey are coming from an absolute nothingness. They carry something of nothingness with them.\nYou cannot grasp it but you can feel it ... a very subtle fragrance ... you cannot see it, but you can smell it. You may not be able to prove it, but you yourself know, it is absolutely certain.\nTa Hui's problem is that from the very beginning he has taken the standpoint of an intellectual. If he was just an ordinary intellectual, satisfied with his intellect and his conceptualizations, there would be no difficulty. But there is some part of him which does not simply want to live with borrowed knowledge. A part of him longs to realize and experience and know the mystery firsthand.\nThis is his dilemma, and he is continuously moving from one part to another part. As we are going further into his sutras, I feel a hope that his mystical part is winning ground. His intellect is lagging behind -- although it is not defeated yet. The first sutra:\nI AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN, \"PROFOUND CLARITY\". A PATRIARCH SAID, \"AS LONG AS THERE IS MENTAL DISCRIMINATION, AND CALCULATING JUDGMENT, ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF ONE'S OWN MIND ARE DREAMS. IF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE QUIESCENT AND EXTINCT, WITHOUT A SINGLE THOUGHT STIRRING, THIS IS CALLED CORRECT AWARENESS.\"\nThe first thing: clarity is always profound. There is no other way for clarity to be. Profound clarity does not make sense.\nIt is just like somebody telling you, \"I love you very, very much.\" In fact, you cannot love less, and you cannot love more. Love does not belong to the world of quantity; hence 'less' and 'more' are irrelevant. You can either love, or not love. How can you love less, and how can you love more?\nStill people go on saying, \"I love you very much,\" not seeing the tremendous fallacy that love is a quality and not a quantity. A quality is either present or not present. More and less belong to the world of quantities.\nThe English word 'matter' and the French word 'meter' come from the Sanskrit word matra, and matra means quantity. That which can be measured is matter -- matter simply means measurable -- and that which cannot be measured, that which is not within the territory of quantity, is consciousness.\nHe's saying, I AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN. He must be initiating somebody into sannyas and giving him the name Chan-Jan, which means profound clarity. But he does not understand that clarity is always profound; it is never less and never more. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken out of it.\nThis is the problem with intellectual understanding. You seem to understand, and still you go on somewhere missing the point. The intellectuals try in every way to be as profound as the mystics, but their profundity is hilarious.\nI am reminded of an ancient parable: A great archer -- he was also the king of his country\n-- was going through a village in his golden chariot, and he was amazed to see that on every tree there was a target, and an arrow or many arrows exactly hitting the bull's-eye. There was a circle, and the arrow was exactly in the middle; there was not a single miss, and on almost all the trees there were a few arrows. He could not believe that in this small village there was such a great archer.\nHe stopped his chariot, and he enquired about the archer. The person he enquired of started laughing. He said, \"He is an idiot! Don't be worried about him.\"\nBut the king said, \"You don't understand. He may be an idiot -- I'm not concerned with that\n-- but he is a greater archer than me, that is certain. I would like to see him.\"\nA crowd gathered, seeing the king, and they all laughed and said, \"It is pointless. He is really a fool.\"\nBut the king could not understand how an idiot can manage such good shots, absolutely perfect, impeccable. He said, \"Stop laughing and call the man!\" A young man was brought to him; he looked stupid, retarded. The king was also puzzled. He asked the young man, \"What is your secret?\"\nThe young man said, \"What secret?\"\nThe king showed him that every arrow is exactly in the middle of a circle.\nThe young man started laughing. He said, \"I cannot lie to you. The truth is, first I shoot the arrow and then I draw the circle. Naturally, one hundred percent ... It does not matter where the arrow goes; wherever it goes, I make the circle later on. Everybody who passes through this village is struck by the great art. I remain quiet, I never say the truth to anybody, but you are the king and I cannot lie to you.\"\nThis is really the situation of intellectuals. They are profound archers -- but first they shoot the arrow and then they draw the target! Their work appears, to those who don't know their way and their strategy, as perfect.\nNow, giving a disciple the name \"profound clarity,\" he cannot even think that he is doing something wrong. He does not know what clarity is, as an experience; otherwise he would never have given the name, \"profound clarity.\" Clarity is enough unto itself.\nA PATRIARCH SAID, \"AS LONG AS THERE IS MENTAL DISCRIMINATION, AND CALCULATING JUDGMENT, ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF ONE'S OWN MIND ARE DREAMS. IF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE QUIESCENT AND EXTINCT, WITHOUT A SINGLE THOUGHT STIRRING, THIS IS CALLED CORRECT AWARENESS.\"\nWhenever he quotes, almost always he is right, but only when it is a quotation. These are not his words. I am coming to his words, and then you will see how the intellectual falls far below the mystic and his experience. These are his words:\nTHESE DAYS THERE IS A KIND OF PHONY, WHOSE OWN STANDPOINT IS NOT GENUINE: THEY JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR MINDS AND SIT QUIETLY, TO SIT TO THE POINT WHERE THE BREATH CEASES. I CALL THIS LOT, PITIABLE. And, I AM ASKING YOU TO MEDITATE IN JUST THIS WAY -- which he calls PITIABLE -- BUT THOUGH I INSTRUCT YOU LIKE THIS, IT IS JUST THAT THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE ...\nCan you see the stupidity of our intellectual effort to understand that which is beyond? He is teaching the same kind of meditation to people -- then it is right. And when others are teaching the same kind of meditation it is \"pitiable\"; these people are \"phony.\"\nIt is so difficult to save him. In the first place, if this is the same meditation that he himself is giving to others, on what grounds is he calling others phony who are giving the same meditation? He has not made it clear in any way why they are phony, why they are not genuine -- because their teaching of meditation is the same as his own.\nAnd secondly, he says, \"I have to teach this way because IT IS JUST THAT THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.\" That too is absolutely wrong; there are hundreds of methods of meditation -- but he has never meditated. But there is always in intellectuals a kind of rivalry, a kind of competition, a kind of jealousy.\nYou must have seen dogs barking at each other for no reason at all; they just cannot resist the temptation. Once a dog sees another dog, then immediately they both start barking.\nI have heard a story about a dog ... He used to live in Varanasi, the holy place of the Hindus. But everybody was going towards New Delhi, so he enquired, \"What is the matter? Why is everybody going to New Delhi?\" And he found out that those who were representatives of the people were going to Delhi to be members of the parliament. So he collected a great crowd of dogs -- and he was a very big dog, and could bark better than anybody else -- and naturally he was chosen the leader. He informed the dogs of Delhi beforehand, \"I have been chosen from Varanasi, and I am coming. It will take almost one month because I will be walking from Varanasi to New Delhi\" -- but he reached in three days.\nThe dogs of New Delhi were simply amazed. They could not believe that a journey of one month ...\" How did you manage to do it in three days?\"\nHe said, \"You don't know our people! The dogs would not let me rest anywhere. These three days I have been running non-stop. The dogs from one village would follow me barking, and by the time I reached into another village, another group of dogs would follow me. There was no time for anything -- to rest or to sleep or to eat or to drink. All the way I have been running and running.\"\nThe dogs said, \"This is one of our great qualities. It is said in our holy scriptures that intellectuals are born as dogs.\" It is their old habit of barking at each other ... Everything they have forgotten, but the barking has been their very soul.\nNow, as you can see, this man is calling others phony. I don't know what word has been translated as phony. One thing is certain, at the time of Ta Hui China had no telephones ... The word 'phony' comes from telephone, because the voice on the telephone becomes unreal. It loses a living quality; hence the word phony. The word is not Chinese; the word is American\n-- and in America, everything is phony.\nWhat word has been translated as phony? It must have been something like inauthentic, insincere. But to call others inauthentic, insincere, phony, not genuine, without giving any reason, because they are TEACHING PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR MINDS, AND SIT QUIETLY. TO SIT TO THE POINT WHERE THE BREATH CEASES, I CALL THIS LOT PITIABLE. I AM ASKING YOU TO MEDITATE IN JUST THIS WAY, BUT THOUGH I INSTRUCT YOU LIKE THIS, IT IS JUST THAT THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE ...\nIf there is no other choice then why are you calling those poor people phony? They also don't have any other choice.\nSo the first thing: intellectuals have a very egoistic, quarrelsome attitude, always ready to start a battle of words. That is not right for a mystic.\nSecondly, the method that the people he calls phony are teaching is not a right method, but because he himself has never meditated, he does not understand what is right and what is wrong. The method these people are teaching -- and he himself is teaching -- is to control your mind.\nMeditation has nothing to do with controlling the mind -- because every control is a kind of repression and that which is repressed will take its revenge. Whenever you relax a little, the mind that was in control will immediately come up and start, with vengeance, to stir up everything within you.\nMeditation is not control, because control creates tension and meditation is based on relaxation. Meditation has a few essential things in it, whatever the method. But those few essentials are necessary in every method.\nThe first is a relaxed state: no fight with the mind, no control of the mind, no concentration.\nSecond, just watching with a relaxed awareness whatever is going on, without any interference ... just watching the mind, silently, without any judgment, any evaluation. These are the three things: relaxation, watching, no judgment.\nSlowly, slowly a great silence descends over you. All movement within you ceases. You are, but there is no sense of \"I am\" ... just a pure space.\nThere are one hundred and twelve methods of meditation; I have talked on all those methods. They differ in their constitution, but the fundamentals remain the same: relaxation, watchfulness, a non-judgmental attitude.\nSo in the first place the method is wrong. He is teaching the same method, he says, \"because there is no other choice.\" He is not aware of a tremendous choice: one hundred and twelve methods which are as ancient as ten thousand years, at least.\nThe first man to collect all those methods was Shiva, and his statues have been found in Harappa and Mohanjodaro. These cities flourished seven thousand years ago. They must have been the most cultured cities of those days, because their roads were so wide; they had attached bathrooms, they had hot and cold running water in their bathrooms, and they had swimming pools as big as olympic swimming pools.\nIn those cities the only thing that we can recognize which still persists is the statue of Shiva -- the Shivalinga, the phallic symbol of Shiva. That is the only thing that connects us with Harappa and Mohanjodaro. Because of this the historians have concluded that Shiva was not an Aryan, because those cities existed before Aryans came into India.\nBut Shiva has, in his book VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA, one hundred and twelve methods of meditation. More methods can be created -- I have created many more methods -- just the essential ingredients should be there. You can change the device according to the times, according to individuals, but you cannot leave out these three things -- relaxation, watchfulness and a non-judgmental attitude.\nSo, in fact, just these three things are the only method of meditation; all others are variations of the same theme. Whatever Ta Hui has been teaching is wrong. The others must have been other intellectuals, other teachers, whom he is calling phony, and he cannot see a\nsimple thing: how can you call them phony and pitiable if your teaching also is of the same method?\nAnd he is not aware that there are many alternatives -- he has never meditated. One does not have to know Shiva's VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA. If one meditates just with these three essentials, he can create as many methods for different situations, different people, as he likes. But one should have his own experience. And to condemn others who are doing the same thing, he must be utterly blind. He cannot see what he is saying.\nBUDDHIST DISCIPLE CH'EN, YOU HAVE REALIZED THAT PERSONAL EXISTENCE IS FALSE, AND THAT THINGS ARE ILLUSORY. AMIDST ILLUSORY FALSEHOOD YOU WERE ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE THE SAYING \"A DOG HAS NO BUDDHA-NATURE\" -- YOU SENT ME A LETTER EXPRESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THOUGH IN THE MAIN YOUR BASIS IS ALREADY CORRECT, YOU ARE NOT YET CLEAR ABOUT THE GREAT DHARMA -- THIS IS A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH.\nThis is an old statement of Lin Chi and of other Zen masters, and there is a possibility it may be from the times of Gautam Buddha himself. It has been asked down the ages by the disciples ... because Buddhism says that every living being has a buddha-nature; every living being can become a buddha. Naturally, the question arises, does a dog also have buddha-nature? All the great masters have said yes, and those who have said no, don't understand at all.\nIt is something to be pondered over. Why should a dog not have a buddha-nature? If every living being has buddha-nature, why should dogs be such exceptional beings? Just because in your minds the very word 'dog' is condemned, you cannot think that a dog can have a buddha-nature -- \"My God, then what is the point of having a buddha-nature? Even a dog can have it. It is not worth bothering! Years of meditation, long pilgrimages, and finally what you attain is just a dog's nature.\" Naturally those who don't understand have immediately said no -- and Ta Hui agrees with those people who say no.\nBut in fact a dog is just a god spelt wrongly. I for one am absolutely ready to say yes, a dog has as much potential to be a buddha as Gautam Buddha himself. There is no question why poor dogs should be left out, when all beings -- donkeys and monkeys and even Yankees -- all are included. The dog is a poor animal, innocent. There is nothing wrong in the dog. Perhaps he has to travel a long way to become a buddha, but it is only a question of time. Some day a dog is also going to become enlightened. In some birth, somewhere in the future ...\nYou should understand it clearly that in the eternity of time it does not matter whether you become enlightened today, or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, in this life or in another life. In the eternity of time it does not matter at all. In the eternity of time nobody is ahead and nobody is behind, because there is no beginning in time and there is no end in time.\nSo whenever you become enlightened you are always a contemporary of all the buddhas. They may have become enlightened thousands of years before. If you become enlightened today, suddenly you will find you are raised to a different scale of time, where you are a contemporary of all the buddhas, past, present, and future. So a man who has tasted awakening will not deny to dogs their intrinsic treasure. They are living beings.\nOLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, \"THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT IS ALL ALL RIGHT.\" JUST GET THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES. OVER A LONG\nLONG TIME IT WILL SINK IN THOROUGHLY: DON'T WORRY THAT YOU WON'T ATTAIN ONENESS. WORK ON IT!\nHe calls this kind of question -- whether a dog has buddha-nature or not -- A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH. It is natural human curiosity. But at least somebody has entered the path. Such questions don't mean anything to those who have not entered the path at all. It is not a disease; it is simply a curiosity.\nIf all living beings are intrinsically as capable of awakening as human, it simply makes existence truly communist. As far as I am concerned, I think communism is right only when it is concerned with the ultimate nature of beings. Only in that ultimate stage is there equality. Before that, communism is a utopia and is never going to be fulfilled.\nOnly two buddhas are equal, but ignorant people cannot be equal. Ignorant people are psychologically unequal; hence the whole idea of Karl Marx and his followers that man is equal is psychologically wrong.\nNo two men are equal. They have all the differences that you can conceive, and to force them into equality you will have to destroy democracy, you will have to destroy freedom, you will have to destroy freedom of expression, you will have to destroy people's individuality, their dignity of being human, their very pride. It is a very strange kind of equality. Everybody is bulldozed, and everybody becomes equal!\nThere was one king in Greece who was a little cuckoo. He had made a beautiful golden bed in a special guesthouse, a great palace. Only a few guests ever stayed in his guesthouse, and they never came out alive because the trouble with the king was that the guest had to fit with the bed. If he was a little long, then his legs or his head had to be cut to size. Or if he was a little short, then traction -- he had to be pulled from both ends; the king had four wrestlers practicing traction. But anyway he was going to be killed. In traction his head would be pulled out, because they were pulling his head to make him the size of the bed, or his legs may be pulled out.\nThe king believed in the holy scriptures of the whole world: they all suggest that man is made for them, not that they are made for man. His bed was not made for man, every guest has to fit with the bed. As the rumor reached to other friends, other kings, nobody accepted his invitation. He was continuously inviting guests, but nobody was ready to come because anybody who ever went never came back again: what happened to the guests? In fact the king was practicing a sort of communism, making everybody of equal size. And that's what has happened in the Soviet Union for seventy years.\nJust seventy years ago, before the revolution, the Soviet Union was one of the giant countries; it had given birth to a great line of geniuses. In seventy years they have not been able to create a single genius of the quality of Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, not a single man in seventy years. All these five men existed before the revolution, and Maxim Gorky even remained alive after the revolution for a few years.\nIf you want to choose the names of the ten great novelists of the whole world, of all languages, these five will be absolutely there. You cannot leave a single one of them out of a list of ten: the rest of the world will have only five places, and five places will be given to the Russians. Still those five from the rest of the world will not be really comparable to the greatness of the Russian novelists. What happened?\nAfter the revolution, everybody was cut to size. Mind is no longer free. You cannot say anything that is not approved by the government, you cannot write anything that is not approved by the government. There is no freedom of thought. There is no individual expression in anything. Everything has become uniform -- people have disappeared. Only a crowd exists, only numbers, not individuals.\nWhen Khrushchev came into power and was addressing his first meeting of the communist party, he exposed Joseph Stalin, saying that he had killed almost one million people after the revolution. Anybody who was trying to be himself and was not willing to become a cog in the wheel was immediately killed ...\nIn Russia you are not allowed to have any opinion of your own. For everything you have to depend on the government, and the whole country has become a concentration camp, no democracy. The press, the radio, the television, everything belongs to the government. You cannot get information which the government does not release. The Soviet Union lives almost in darkness about the whole world, what is going on in the world. And the Soviet Union is not a small country; it is one sixth of the land of the whole world.\nKhrushchev addressed the first meeting and exposed how brutal, murderous, Joseph Stalin had been. In the name of communism he had killed all the genius of the people, he had reduced everybody to equal poverty. Certainly there has come a certain equality: everybody is equally poor. Everybody is equally suppressed. Everybody is equally enslaved. Everybody is equally trembling with fear. Any moment and death can knock on the door ... In Russia, the name of death is KGB.\nWhen Khrushchev was telling this to the Communist party, one man from the back said, \"You have been a colleague of Joseph Stalin his whole life. Why did you not object?\"\nThere was a great silence. For a moment Khrushchev looked at the place from where the voice had come, and he said, \"Comrade, please just stand up so I can see you better.\" Nobody stood. He again said, \"Just stand up so I can see who is asking the question.\"\nThree times he asked. Nobody stood, and nobody asked the question again. He said, \"Now do you understand why I was silent? Why are you silent? -- because if you stand up, you are finished. I remained silent because I wanted to be alive.\" To create equality, all human values have been destroyed.\nNo ... as far as man is concerned, man needs freedom to be UNequal, equal opportunity to be UNequal. Opportunity should be given equally to all, but opportunities to grow in their uniqueness, in their own individuality: in short, opportunities to be unequal, but equal opportunities.\nOnly when people become enlightened, when there is nothing but a pure consciousness, is communism possible; otherwise that day is just a utopia.\nThe word 'utopia' is very beautiful. It means 'that which never comes'. Only in enlightenment is there a possibility of equality, and to the enlightened person all beings -- they may not be enlightened now -- are going to be enlightened someday. So intrinsically, every being -- every living being, the trees are included -- wherever there is life in any form, they are all on the way, moving, evolving, going higher. And the goal is the same: to become awakened, to become absolute purity, consciousness, blissfulness, ecstasy. So it is not a disease to ask such a question. It is absolutely natural curiosity.\nI am a communist as far as man's intrinsic potential is concerned, and I am not a communist as far as man's actuality is concerned. He should be given every support, every opportunity to grow in his own way. A forced equality is destructive, destructive of all that is valuable. There should be big trees, tall trees reaching to the stars, and there should be small bushes; they both enrich existence. There should be lotuses and there should be roses and there should be marigolds. The variety, the difference, the inequality makes life richer, makes life more livable, lovable.\nJust think, if everybody goes through plastic surgery and has the same kind of nose -- equal noses -- has the same kind of eyes, has the same kind of faces, it will be so boring that people will start walking with closed eyes, tired of seeing the same noses and same eyes and same faces. It will be the most hellish world possible. It is beautiful that there are long noses and short noses, and they come in all sizes and all shapes.\nInequality in humanity is a psychological truth. Equality is a spiritual truth.\nOne should not get mixed up.\nA dog has a buddha-nature, just as anybody else has. It is not the disease of a beginner entering the path. It is purely a human curiosity, whether all living beings have the same potential to blossom into the ultimate ecstasy that only very few people -- a Gautam Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Zarathustra -- have achieved. I consider it absolutely normal, not a disease.\nTa Hui quotes Gautam Buddha, which needs some explanation because you will not understand it. And I don't think Ta Hui understands it, because he gives no explanation about it. OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, \"THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT IS ALL ALL RIGHT.\"\nHe does not explain why he is quoting this statement. He is simply throwing names, quotations, which is one of the strategies of intellectuals to show their knowledgeability. But I don't think he understands even the meaning of it, because it is one of the most difficult things to understand.\nAristotle is said to be the father of Western logic. His logic is the simplest logic: Black is black, white is white; yes means yes, no means no -- a clearcut division. It is called twofold logic. Gautam Buddha believed -- and I think he has far greater insight than Aristotle -- in a threefold logic. And if you can understand his threefold logic, only then will this statement become clear to you.\nFor example, if somebody asked Gautam Buddha, \"Does God exist?\", according to his threefold logic he will answer, \"Yes, God exists. No, God does not exist. Yes and no both: God exists, God does not exist.\" Aristotle's logic is twofold: either God exists, or God does not exist. There is no question of the third possibility, that both may be right.\nIn a certain sense, from a certain angle, it may be said with absolute truthfulness that God exists, for example if you mean that existence is intelligent, that existence is not material, that existence is basically made of consciousness and even matter is only a form of sleeping consciousness -- consciousness in coma. If you can mean by God, \"universal consciousness,\" he exists. But you may mean by God, \"a person who created the world\"; then God does not exist.\nBut it is possible to conceive of God as consciousness, and also not as a creator, but as the very creativity of existence. It all depends on us and what we mean by God, because God is only a hypothesis, a word; the meaning has to be given by us. If God is not a creator and a person but the very phenomenon of creativity and consciousness, then both are right: God exists and God does not exist.\nThis was the threefold logic. And Gautam Buddha is going to win the future world over to threefold logic. Aristotle is already out of date. But Gautam Buddha's contemporary, Mahavira, has a sevenfold logic, and he is going to be the ultimate winner as far as logic is concerned because he has gone to all the possible alternatives. These three alternatives are not all the possibilities. For example, Mahavira's fourth alternative is: perhaps God is not. And the fifth: perhaps God exists and is indefinable; he brings indefinability as the fifth alternative. And the sixth: perhaps God is not, and is still indefinable. And the seventh: perhaps nothing can be said, only that it is indefinable. He has covered all the possibilities and interpretations. Even Gautam Buddha avoided going that far; he remained within comprehensible limits. Now, seeing his statement, you can understand it. OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, \"THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT IS ALL ALL RIGHT.\"\nThree statements ... it makes experience more mysterious. Aristotle demystifies existence. Just dividing it into life and death, into day and night, into right and wrong, into good and bad, into God and Devil is a little childish, a little retarded. Life is more complex than that. He is only taking the two extremes, and he is forgetting the middle point.\nBuddha has called his way the middle way, so he has to take into account the exact middle point where the opposites meet, where contradictions dissolve into each other and become complementaries. Then it becomes a threefold logic: two extremes and one where extremes merge and melt into oneness. His approach is not only more mystical, it is more scientific too.\nModern physics is coming closer to Gautam Buddha and completely abandoning Aristotle. And with Aristotle is also abandoned Euclidean geometry, because that was a by-product of Aristotelian logic. So Aristotle and Euclid have reigned for two thousand years in the West, but modern physics finds that things are more complicated than Aristotle and Euclid thought. Gautam Buddha perhaps is closer to reality because he is taking a more mysterious approach. He is broadening our perception of reality.\nMy own feeling is that ultimately modern physics will have to accept not only Gautam Buddha but Mahavira, because his sevenfold logic is absolutely complete. You cannot add anything more. There cannot be eightfold logic; with seven possibilities, all have been covered. Nothing has been left out, everything has been taken in; it is all-inclusive. Mahavira has been accepted -- without scientists even knowing that they are accepting a certain man who lived twenty-five centuries before, a contemporary of Gautam Buddha -- because he preached the theory of relativity. Mahavira was the first man to preach the theory of relativity.\nAlbert Einstein would have been immensely happy if somebody had introduced him to Mahavira's theory of relativity. It is not about physics, it is about human consciousness, but it is the same standpoint. And Albert Einstein would have danced if he had heard the sevenfold logic of Mahavira because he was finding so much difficulty with Aristotle. Reality was big, and logic was smaller; it was not able to help in any way to further research going deeper into matter and energy. It was good for day-to-day work in the marketplace, but it was not good enough for deeper realms.\nBut I think Ta Hui has not got any idea why he has quoted this statement ... perhaps just to mystify people, just to pretend that he understands this strange logic of threefoldness, because he does not say anything about it. It is out of context. Anything said must have some meaning, some relationship. It is neither related to the previous sutra, nor is it related to the succeeding sutra. He has just inserted it.\nMy feeling is: he simply wants to mystify people, pretending that he knows great things that they cannot understand. It is one of the significant things to understand about man that whatever he cannot understand he thinks must be right. Because of this, philosophers have been writing in such a way that you will go on reading big phrases, long phrases, long sentences, big paragraphs -- so big that by the time you come to the end of the paragraph, you have forgotten the beginning.\nFor example, the German philosopher Hegel was a master in mystifying absolutely nonsensical things, and his whole strategy was just to write big words, pompous, bombastic. A single sentence would run the whole page, and by the time you come to the end of the sentence you don't have any idea what was in the beginning, what was in the middle ...\nHegel was thought to be a great philosopher -- till he was understood! When he was understood, he was put aside as just a tricky fellow, who was only trying to mystify people. And he had succeeded. At least in his life, he enjoyed the idea of being a great philosopher. Only after his death slowly, slowly scholars looked into it and found that he says nothing. He says so much, but if you condense it, your hands are empty. There is nothing in it.\nWhenever I have thought about Hegel, I have always remembered a man in my village. He was almost a nutcase; he had crammed the whole Oxford dictionary, and he used to write letters to the president, to the prime minister, to the governor. He was living just near my house.\nOnce in a while he used to come to me to show me his letters -- twenty pages, thirty pages, fifty foolscap pages typed out, but not a single sentence making any sense. He knew nothing about language; he knew everything about the dictionary, and that was the trouble. He would simply go on writing big words; it made no sense at all.\nHe was torturing me, so I said, \"You do one thing. I don't have much time and your letters are too long, and it will be helpful also because this big letter the President is not going to read. So with the letter you should write a small summary, just ten lines, twelve lines at the most.\"\nHe said, \"That's a good idea. I will write the summary. That is not a problem.\"\nSo he went to write the summary, but he left the letter with me. I was surprised; this is something strange, how is he going to write the summary? There was no problem for him; the dictionary was with him ... so another ten lines of absolute absurdity. I said, \"This is perfectly good. This explains everything! And I can say to you that this much the president is going to read. Twenty pages is too much. You write such great philosophy.\"\nBut nobody was answering his letters. He would come to me saying, \"Now one month has passed and no answer, not even a receipt that they have received my letter! And I had been working so hard.\"\nI said to him, \"I don't think these politicians have intelligence enough to understand your great philosophy.\"\nHe said, \"That is right. You are the only man who understands me. Nobody seems to understand.\"\nEvery day he was going to the collectorate with a new letter and the collector was tired. One day the collector met me in the library and he said, \"Can't you stop this man? I never read any of his letters, but even to keep them on the table is a torture. One feels inside one's stomach some disturbance; just to read two or three lines is enough to drive anybody crazy.\"\nI said, \"It is very difficult to stop him, because I am the only man who understands him. If you have any difficulty, I can tell him, and he can explain.\"\nHe said, \"I don't want you to mention it to him at all! He will come with a bigger explanation.\"\nOnce in a while I used to go to my town, and he used to wait for me. I loved the man. He was crazy, but very nice and very sweet and absolutely harmless. I told him, \"You have done only one thing wrong.\"\nHe said, \"What?\"\nI said, \"You should have been born in Germany, and you would have been known in history as a great philosopher. I have studied all those great German philosophers; they are all nutcases!\"\nOne man who was thought to be one of the greatest German philosophers of this century, Martin Heidegger, started many books, but he never completed any because by the time he was halfway, he had forgotten what he had written. So the first volume would be published, and people would be waiting for the second volume; it never came.\nThis went on happening his whole life; he never completed any book. When asked, he said, \"The reality is, I myself forget what I have been writing. It is so complicated that it is better to start a new book rather than to read the old one. Let others read ... I don't want to get involved in it.\" It will be a great entertainment to you if you read something of Martin Heidegger.\nAnd this shows his great \"intelligence\": he was a follower of Adolf Hitler, who was certainly a madman! The greatest philosopher follows an idiot ... it does not show anything about Adolf Hitler, but it shows something about Martin Heidegger! I have gone through all his works. In the end your hands are empty. You don't get anything of what he wants to say, why he wants to say it. Why all this long process of gymnastics without any conclusion? But these people have been impressing the common masses.\nMy understanding is that whatever people cannot understand they think must be great. Because we cannot understand, naturally it has to be something very miraculous, very mysterious. But the truth is always simple: it is mysterious because it is simple.\nThe truth is always obvious.\nIt is miraculous because it is obvious, not because it is complex, not because it is far away.\nIt is so close that you tend to forget it. It is within you, so you don't even bother to look at it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7493","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Clarity</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7493 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Buddha and Jesus are equal, and immediately the restlessness
disappears.</p><p>Ta Hui is an intellectual. Calling Buddha a barbarian, sooner or
later he must have realized that that was going too far -- and it was
too ugly.</p><p>I hope that he will come back. Even if he can come back at the last
moment of his death, everything else can be forgiven. It is human to
forgive ... The ancient saying is, "It is human to err and it is divine
to forgive." I want a little change in it: "It is human to err, it is
more human to forgive." Why bring in the divine unnecessarily? The
scientific mind always tries to have as few hypotheses as possible.</p><p>Maneesha had asked last night, seeing that Ta Hui has not proved a
great treasure of enlightenment, "We can finish the discourses on Ta Hui
tonight ..."</p><p>I said; "No, because that will be an injustice. I have hammered him.
If he can come back home I would like to appreciate him also; so I will
go through all the sutras.</p><p>I don't know what is going to happen in them. But a man, even though
he may be an intellectual ... if he continues, sooner or later he is
going to recognize that he is going round and round in a circle. There
is much more than this continuous circle, but that much more can be seen
only if you stand out of the circle as a witness. And I think he is
capable -- because everybody is capable. It is only a question of when
you turn inwards, only a question of when you drop your pretensions and
hypocrisies.</p><p>So I will wait for two weeks -- she says there will be sutras for two
weeks more. If he goes astray, he will get hit. But my feeling is, a man
who is interested may realize at some point that what he is doing is
only intellectual gymnastics -- and that may prove a turning point in
his life. If it happens, then this whole series on Ta Hui will be of
immense significance, because it will be the story of any man --
wandering, going astray, coming back to the path and then falling again
and again, but at the end, finally he becomes a light unto himself.</p><p>I will also feel at ease, because I don't like to hit anybody. If I
can see him coming back with the insight of enlightenment as his own
experience, I will also feel good: 'The man was worth hitting. You were
not hitting just an ordinary idiot -- he was extraordinary!"</p><p>I don't know what is going to happen in these two weeks. It all
depends on Ta Hui -- how many times he is going to go astray, and
whether he has the potential to realize, or he dies without
realization.</p><p>It will be a sad affair if he dies without enlightenment. I would
like it to be a celebration ... and my hope is that the man is
capable.</p><p>Any moment the turning point can come, and any moment his inner flame
can burn bright.</p><p>So you will have to tolerate Ta Hui for at least two weeks more.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>14</p><p>Clarity</p><p>21 July 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, PROFOUND CLARITY</p><p>I AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN, "PROFOUND CLARITY".

FALSE, AND THAT THINGS ARE ILLUSORY. AMIDST ILLUSORY FALSEHOOD YOU WERE
ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE THE SAYING "A DOG HAS NO BUDDHA-NATURE" -- YOU SENT
ME A LETTER EXPRESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THOUGH IN THE MAIN YOUR BASIS
IS ALREADY CORRECT, YOU ARE NOT YET CLEAR ABOUT THE GREAT DHARMA -- THIS
IS A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH.</p><p>OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, "THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY
IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT'S ALL ALL RIGHT." JUST
GET THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES. OVER A LONG LONG TIME IT
WILL SINK IN THOROUGHLY: DON'T WORRY THAT YOU WON'T ATTAIN ONENESS. WORK
ON IT!</p><p><br></p><p>I can see the difficulties Ta Hui is passing through. He can
intellectually understand the path of awareness, he can also
intellectually explain it to others -- but he himself still remains only
a philosopher. He has not transformed himself into a mystic.</p><p>The philosopher talks about truth. The mystic is truth.</p><p>And there is a profound difference between talking about it and being
it.</p><p>Certainly the people who have reached to the point of being truth
itself also can talk, but their words vibrate on a totally different
level, and it can be seen very clearly that they are not coming from the
mind.</p><p>They are coming from an absolute nothingness. They carry something of
nothingness with them.</p><p>You cannot grasp it but you can feel it ... a very subtle fragrance
... you cannot see it, but you can smell it. You may not be able to
prove it, but you yourself know, it is absolutely certain.</p><p>Ta Hui's problem is that from the very beginning he has taken the
standpoint of an intellectual. If he was just an ordinary intellectual,
satisfied with his intellect and his conceptualizations, there would be
no difficulty. But there is some part of him which does not simply want
to live with borrowed knowledge. A part of him longs to realize and
experience and know the mystery firsthand.</p><p>This is his dilemma, and he is continuously moving from one part to
another part. As we are going further into his sutras, I feel a hope
that his mystical part is winning ground. His intellect is lagging
behind -- although it is not defeated yet. The first sutra:</p><p>I AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN, "PROFOUND CLARITY". A PATRIARCH
SAID, "AS LONG AS THERE IS MENTAL DISCRIMINATION, AND CALCULATING
JUDGMENT, ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF ONE'S OWN MIND ARE DREAMS. IF MIND AND
CONSCIOUSNESS ARE QUIESCENT AND EXTINCT, WITHOUT A SINGLE THOUGHT
STIRRING, THIS IS CALLED CORRECT AWARENESS."</p><p>The first thing: clarity is always profound. There is no other way
for clarity to be. Profound clarity does not make sense.</p><p>It is just like somebody telling you, "I love you very, very much."
In fact, you cannot love less, and you cannot love more. Love does not
belong to the world of quantity; hence 'less' and 'more' are irrelevant.
You can either love, or not love. How can you love less, and how can you
love more?</p><p>Still people go on saying, "I love you very much," not seeing the
tremendous fallacy that love is a quality and not a quantity. A quality
is either present or not present. More and less belong to the world of
quantities.</p><p>The English word 'matter' and the French word 'meter' come from the
Sanskrit word matra, and matra means quantity. That which can be
measured is matter -- matter simply means measurable -- and that which
cannot be measured, that which is not within the territory of quantity,
is consciousness.</p><p>He's saying, I AM GIVING YOU THE NAME CHAN-JAN. He must be initiating
somebody into sannyas and giving him the name Chan-Jan, which means
profound clarity. But he does not understand that clarity is always
profound; it is never less and never more. Nothing can be added to it,
and nothing can be taken out of it.</p><p>This is the problem with intellectual understanding. You seem to
understand, and still you go on somewhere missing the point. The
intellectuals try in every way to be as profound as the mystics, but
their profundity is hilarious.</p><p>I am reminded of an ancient parable: A great archer -- he was also
the king of his country</p><p>-- was going through a village in his golden chariot, and he was
amazed to see that on every tree there was a target, and an arrow or
many arrows exactly hitting the bull's-eye. There was a circle, and the
arrow was exactly in the middle; there was not a single miss, and on
almost all the trees there were a few arrows. He could not believe that
in this small village there was such a great archer.</p><p>He stopped his chariot, and he enquired about the archer. The person
he enquired of started laughing. He said, "He is an idiot! Don't be
worried about him."</p><p>But the king said, "You don't understand. He may be an idiot -- I'm
not concerned with that</p><p>-- but he is a greater archer than me, that is certain. I would like
to see him."</p><p>A crowd gathered, seeing the king, and they all laughed and said, "It
is pointless. He is really a fool."</p><p>But the king could not understand how an idiot can manage such good
shots, absolutely perfect, impeccable. He said, "Stop laughing and call
the man!" A young man was brought to him; he looked stupid, retarded.
The king was also puzzled. He asked the young man, "What is your
secret?"</p><p>The young man said, "What secret?"</p><p>The king showed him that every arrow is exactly in the middle of a
circle.</p><p>The young man started laughing. He said, "I cannot lie to you. The
truth is, first I shoot the arrow and then I draw the circle. Naturally,
one hundred percent ... It does not matter where the arrow goes;
wherever it goes, I make the circle later on. Everybody who passes
through this village is struck by the great art. I remain quiet, I never
say the truth to anybody, but you are the king and I cannot lie to
you."</p><p>This is really the situation of intellectuals. They are profound
archers -- but first they shoot the arrow and then they draw the target!
Their work appears, to those who don't know their way and their
strategy, as perfect.</p><p>Now, giving a disciple the name "profound clarity," he cannot even
think that he is doing something wrong. He does not know what clarity
is, as an experience; otherwise he would never have given the name,
"profound clarity." Clarity is enough unto itself.</p><p>A PATRIARCH SAID, "AS LONG AS THERE IS MENTAL DISCRIMINATION, AND
CALCULATING JUDGMENT, ALL THE PERCEPTIONS OF ONE'S OWN MIND ARE DREAMS.
IF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE QUIESCENT AND EXTINCT, WITHOUT A SINGLE
THOUGHT STIRRING, THIS IS CALLED CORRECT AWARENESS."</p><p>Whenever he quotes, almost always he is right, but only when it is a
quotation. These are not his words. I am coming to his words, and then
you will see how the intellectual falls far below the mystic and his
experience. These are his words:</p><p>THESE DAYS THERE IS A KIND OF PHONY, WHOSE OWN STANDPOINT IS NOT
GENUINE: THEY JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR MINDS AND SIT QUIETLY,
TO SIT TO THE POINT WHERE THE BREATH CEASES. I CALL THIS LOT, PITIABLE.
And, I AM ASKING YOU TO MEDITATE IN JUST THIS WAY -- which he calls
PITIABLE -- BUT THOUGH I INSTRUCT YOU LIKE THIS, IT IS JUST THAT THERE
IS NO OTHER CHOICE ...</p><p>Can you see the stupidity of our intellectual effort to understand
that which is beyond? He is teaching the same kind of meditation to
people -- then it is right. And when others are teaching the same kind
of meditation it is "pitiable"; these people are "phony."</p><p>It is so difficult to save him. In the first place, if this is the
same meditation that he himself is giving to others, on what grounds is
he calling others phony who are giving the same meditation? He has not
made it clear in any way why they are phony, why they are not genuine --
because their teaching of meditation is the same as his own.</p><p>And secondly, he says, "I have to teach this way because IT IS JUST
THAT THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE." That too is absolutely wrong; there are
hundreds of methods of meditation -- but he has never meditated. But
there is always in intellectuals a kind of rivalry, a kind of
competition, a kind of jealousy.</p><p>You must have seen dogs barking at each other for no reason at all;
they just cannot resist the temptation. Once a dog sees another dog,
then immediately they both start barking.</p><p>I have heard a story about a dog ... He used to live in Varanasi, the
holy place of the Hindus. But everybody was going towards New Delhi, so
he enquired, "What is the matter? Why is everybody going to New Delhi?"
And he found out that those who were representatives of the people were
going to Delhi to be members of the parliament. So he collected a great
crowd of dogs -- and he was a very big dog, and could bark better than
anybody else -- and naturally he was chosen the leader. He informed the
dogs of Delhi beforehand, "I have been chosen from Varanasi, and I am
coming. It will take almost one month because I will be walking from
Varanasi to New Delhi" -- but he reached in three days.</p><p>The dogs of New Delhi were simply amazed. They could not believe that
a journey of one month ..." How did you manage to do it in three
days?"</p><p>He said, "You don't know our people! The dogs would not let me rest
anywhere. These three days I have been running non-stop. The dogs from
one village would follow me barking, and by the time I reached into
another village, another group of dogs would follow me. There was no
time for anything -- to rest or to sleep or to eat or to drink. All the
way I have been running and running."</p><p>The dogs said, "This is one of our great qualities. It is said in our
holy scriptures that intellectuals are born as dogs." It is their old
habit of barking at each other ... Everything they have forgotten, but
the barking has been their very soul.</p><p>Now, as you can see, this man is calling others phony. I don't know
what word has been translated as phony. One thing is certain, at the
time of Ta Hui China had no telephones ... The word 'phony' comes from
telephone, because the voice on the telephone becomes unreal. It loses a
living quality; hence the word phony. The word is not Chinese; the word
is American</p><p>-- and in America, everything is phony.</p><p>What word has been translated as phony? It must have been something
like inauthentic, insincere. But to call others inauthentic, insincere,
phony, not genuine, without giving any reason, because they are TEACHING
PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR MINDS, AND SIT QUIETLY. TO SIT TO THE POINT
WHERE THE BREATH CEASES, I CALL THIS LOT PITIABLE. I AM ASKING YOU TO
MEDITATE IN JUST THIS WAY, BUT THOUGH I INSTRUCT YOU LIKE THIS, IT IS
JUST THAT THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE ...</p><p>If there is no other choice then why are you calling those poor
people phony? They also don't have any other choice.</p><p>So the first thing: intellectuals have a very egoistic, quarrelsome
attitude, always ready to start a battle of words. That is not right for
a mystic.</p><p>Secondly, the method that the people he calls phony are teaching is
not a right method, but because he himself has never meditated, he does
not understand what is right and what is wrong. The method these people
are teaching -- and he himself is teaching -- is to control your
mind.</p><p>Meditation has nothing to do with controlling the mind -- because
every control is a kind of repression and that which is repressed will
take its revenge. Whenever you relax a little, the mind that was in
control will immediately come up and start, with vengeance, to stir up
everything within you.</p><p>Meditation is not control, because control creates tension and
meditation is based on relaxation. Meditation has a few essential things
in it, whatever the method. But those few essentials are necessary in
every method.</p><p>The first is a relaxed state: no fight with the mind, no control of
the mind, no concentration.</p><p>Second, just watching with a relaxed awareness whatever is going on,
without any interference ... just watching the mind, silently, without
any judgment, any evaluation. These are the three things: relaxation,
watching, no judgment.</p><p>Slowly, slowly a great silence descends over you. All movement within
you ceases. You are, but there is no sense of "I am" ... just a pure
space.</p><p>There are one hundred and twelve methods of meditation; I have talked
on all those methods. They differ in their constitution, but the
fundamentals remain the same: relaxation, watchfulness, a non-judgmental
attitude.</p><p>So in the first place the method is wrong. He is teaching the same
method, he says, "because there is no other choice." He is not aware of
a tremendous choice: one hundred and twelve methods which are as ancient
as ten thousand years, at least.</p><p>The first man to collect all those methods was Shiva, and his statues
have been found in Harappa and Mohanjodaro. These cities flourished
seven thousand years ago. They must have been the most cultured cities
of those days, because their roads were so wide; they had attached
bathrooms, they had hot and cold running water in their bathrooms, and
they had swimming pools as big as olympic swimming pools.</p><p>In those cities the only thing that we can recognize which still
persists is the statue of Shiva -- the Shivalinga, the phallic symbol of
Shiva. That is the only thing that connects us with Harappa and
Mohanjodaro. Because of this the historians have concluded that Shiva
was not an Aryan, because those cities existed before Aryans came into
India.</p><p>But Shiva has, in his book VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA, one hundred and
twelve methods of meditation. More methods can be created -- I have
created many more methods -- just the essential ingredients should be
there. You can change the device according to the times, according to
individuals, but you cannot leave out these three things -- relaxation,
watchfulness and a non-judgmental attitude.</p><p>So, in fact, just these three things are the only method of
meditation; all others are variations of the same theme. Whatever Ta Hui
has been teaching is wrong. The others must have been other
intellectuals, other teachers, whom he is calling phony, and he cannot
see a</p><p>simple thing: how can you call them phony and pitiable if your
teaching also is of the same method?</p><p>And he is not aware that there are many alternatives -- he has never
meditated. One does not have to know Shiva's VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA. If
one meditates just with these three essentials, he can create as many
methods for different situations, different people, as he likes. But one
should have his own experience. And to condemn others who are doing the
same thing, he must be utterly blind. He cannot see what he is
saying.</p><p>BUDDHIST DISCIPLE CH'EN, YOU HAVE REALIZED THAT PERSONAL EXISTENCE IS
FALSE, AND THAT THINGS ARE ILLUSORY. AMIDST ILLUSORY FALSEHOOD YOU WERE
ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE THE SAYING "A DOG HAS NO BUDDHA-NATURE" -- YOU SENT
ME A LETTER EXPRESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THOUGH IN THE MAIN YOUR BASIS
IS ALREADY CORRECT, YOU ARE NOT YET CLEAR ABOUT THE GREAT DHARMA -- THIS
IS A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH.</p><p>This is an old statement of Lin Chi and of other Zen masters, and
there is a possibility it may be from the times of Gautam Buddha
himself. It has been asked down the ages by the disciples ... because
Buddhism says that every living being has a buddha-nature; every living
being can become a buddha. Naturally, the question arises, does a dog
also have buddha-nature? All the great masters have said yes, and those
who have said no, don't understand at all.</p><p>It is something to be pondered over. Why should a dog not have a
buddha-nature? If every living being has buddha-nature, why should dogs
be such exceptional beings? Just because in your minds the very word
'dog' is condemned, you cannot think that a dog can have a buddha-nature
-- "My God, then what is the point of having a buddha-nature? Even a dog
can have it. It is not worth bothering! Years of meditation, long
pilgrimages, and finally what you attain is just a dog's nature."
Naturally those who don't understand have immediately said no -- and Ta
Hui agrees with those people who say no.</p><p>But in fact a dog is just a god spelt wrongly. I for one am
absolutely ready to say yes, a dog has as much potential to be a buddha
as Gautam Buddha himself. There is no question why poor dogs should be
left out, when all beings -- donkeys and monkeys and even Yankees -- all
are included. The dog is a poor animal, innocent. There is nothing wrong
in the dog. Perhaps he has to travel a long way to become a buddha, but
it is only a question of time. Some day a dog is also going to become
enlightened. In some birth, somewhere in the future ...</p><p>You should understand it clearly that in the eternity of time it does
not matter whether you become enlightened today, or tomorrow, or the day
after tomorrow, in this life or in another life. In the eternity of time
it does not matter at all. In the eternity of time nobody is ahead and
nobody is behind, because there is no beginning in time and there is no
end in time.</p><p>So whenever you become enlightened you are always a contemporary of
all the buddhas. They may have become enlightened thousands of years
before. If you become enlightened today, suddenly you will find you are
raised to a different scale of time, where you are a contemporary of all
the buddhas, past, present, and future. So a man who has tasted
awakening will not deny to dogs their intrinsic treasure. They are
living beings.</p><p>OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, "THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY
IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT IS ALL ALL RIGHT." JUST
GET THE ROOT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BRANCHES. OVER A LONG</p><p>LONG TIME IT WILL SINK IN THOROUGHLY: DON'T WORRY THAT YOU WON'T
ATTAIN ONENESS. WORK ON IT!</p><p>He calls this kind of question -- whether a dog has buddha-nature or
not -- A COMMON DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH. It is natural
human curiosity. But at least somebody has entered the path. Such
questions don't mean anything to those who have not entered the path at
all. It is not a disease; it is simply a curiosity.</p><p>If all living beings are intrinsically as capable of awakening as
human, it simply makes existence truly communist. As far as I am
concerned, I think communism is right only when it is concerned with the
ultimate nature of beings. Only in that ultimate stage is there
equality. Before that, communism is a utopia and is never going to be
fulfilled.</p><p>Only two buddhas are equal, but ignorant people cannot be equal.
Ignorant people are psychologically unequal; hence the whole idea of
Karl Marx and his followers that man is equal is psychologically
wrong.</p><p>No two men are equal. They have all the differences that you can
conceive, and to force them into equality you will have to destroy
democracy, you will have to destroy freedom, you will have to destroy
freedom of expression, you will have to destroy people's individuality,
their dignity of being human, their very pride. It is a very strange
kind of equality. Everybody is bulldozed, and everybody becomes
equal!</p><p>There was one king in Greece who was a little cuckoo. He had made a
beautiful golden bed in a special guesthouse, a great palace. Only a few
guests ever stayed in his guesthouse, and they never came out alive
because the trouble with the king was that the guest had to fit with the
bed. If he was a little long, then his legs or his head had to be cut to
size. Or if he was a little short, then traction -- he had to be pulled
from both ends; the king had four wrestlers practicing traction. But
anyway he was going to be killed. In traction his head would be pulled
out, because they were pulling his head to make him the size of the bed,
or his legs may be pulled out.</p><p>The king believed in the holy scriptures of the whole world: they all
suggest that man is made for them, not that they are made for man. His
bed was not made for man, every guest has to fit with the bed. As the
rumor reached to other friends, other kings, nobody accepted his
invitation. He was continuously inviting guests, but nobody was ready to
come because anybody who ever went never came back again: what happened
to the guests? In fact the king was practicing a sort of communism,
making everybody of equal size. And that's what has happened in the
Soviet Union for seventy years.</p><p>Just seventy years ago, before the revolution, the Soviet Union was
one of the giant countries; it had given birth to a great line of
geniuses. In seventy years they have not been able to create a single
genius of the quality of Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Fyodor
Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, not a single man in seventy years. All these five
men existed before the revolution, and Maxim Gorky even remained alive
after the revolution for a few years.</p><p>If you want to choose the names of the ten great novelists of the
whole world, of all languages, these five will be absolutely there. You
cannot leave a single one of them out of a list of ten: the rest of the
world will have only five places, and five places will be given to the
Russians. Still those five from the rest of the world will not be really
comparable to the greatness of the Russian novelists. What happened?</p><p>After the revolution, everybody was cut to size. Mind is no longer
free. You cannot say anything that is not approved by the government,
you cannot write anything that is not approved by the government. There
is no freedom of thought. There is no individual expression in anything.
Everything has become uniform -- people have disappeared. Only a crowd
exists, only numbers, not individuals.</p><p>When Khrushchev came into power and was addressing his first meeting
of the communist party, he exposed Joseph Stalin, saying that he had
killed almost one million people after the revolution. Anybody who was
trying to be himself and was not willing to become a cog in the wheel
was immediately killed ...</p><p>In Russia you are not allowed to have any opinion of your own. For
everything you have to depend on the government, and the whole country
has become a concentration camp, no democracy. The press, the radio, the
television, everything belongs to the government. You cannot get
information which the government does not release. The Soviet Union
lives almost in darkness about the whole world, what is going on in the
world. And the Soviet Union is not a small country; it is one sixth of
the land of the whole world.</p><p>Khrushchev addressed the first meeting and exposed how brutal,
murderous, Joseph Stalin had been. In the name of communism he had
killed all the genius of the people, he had reduced everybody to equal
poverty. Certainly there has come a certain equality: everybody is
equally poor. Everybody is equally suppressed. Everybody is equally
enslaved. Everybody is equally trembling with fear. Any moment and death
can knock on the door ... In Russia, the name of death is KGB.</p><p>When Khrushchev was telling this to the Communist party, one man from
the back said, "You have been a colleague of Joseph Stalin his whole
life. Why did you not object?"</p><p>There was a great silence. For a moment Khrushchev looked at the
place from where the voice had come, and he said, "Comrade, please just
stand up so I can see you better." Nobody stood. He again said, "Just
stand up so I can see who is asking the question."</p><p>Three times he asked. Nobody stood, and nobody asked the question
again. He said, "Now do you understand why I was silent? Why are you
silent? -- because if you stand up, you are finished. I remained silent
because I wanted to be alive." To create equality, all human values have
been destroyed.</p><p>No ... as far as man is concerned, man needs freedom to be UNequal,
equal opportunity to be UNequal. Opportunity should be given equally to
all, but opportunities to grow in their uniqueness, in their own
individuality: in short, opportunities to be unequal, but equal
opportunities.</p><p>Only when people become enlightened, when there is nothing but a pure
consciousness, is communism possible; otherwise that day is just a
utopia.</p><p>The word 'utopia' is very beautiful. It means 'that which never
comes'. Only in enlightenment is there a possibility of equality, and to
the enlightened person all beings -- they may not be enlightened now --
are going to be enlightened someday. So intrinsically, every being --
every living being, the trees are included -- wherever there is life in
any form, they are all on the way, moving, evolving, going higher. And
the goal is the same: to become awakened, to become absolute purity,
consciousness, blissfulness, ecstasy. So it is not a disease to ask such
a question. It is absolutely natural curiosity.</p><p>I am a communist as far as man's intrinsic potential is concerned,
and I am not a communist as far as man's actuality is concerned. He
should be given every support, every opportunity to grow in his own way.
A forced equality is destructive, destructive of all that is valuable.
There should be big trees, tall trees reaching to the stars, and there
should be small bushes; they both enrich existence. There should be
lotuses and there should be roses and there should be marigolds. The
variety, the difference, the inequality makes life richer, makes life
more livable, lovable.</p><p>Just think, if everybody goes through plastic surgery and has the
same kind of nose -- equal noses -- has the same kind of eyes, has the
same kind of faces, it will be so boring that people will start walking
with closed eyes, tired of seeing the same noses and same eyes and same
faces. It will be the most hellish world possible. It is beautiful that
there are long noses and short noses, and they come in all sizes and all
shapes.</p><p>Inequality in humanity is a psychological truth. Equality is a
spiritual truth.</p><p>One should not get mixed up.</p><p>A dog has a buddha-nature, just as anybody else has. It is not the
disease of a beginner entering the path. It is purely a human curiosity,
whether all living beings have the same potential to blossom into the
ultimate ecstasy that only very few people -- a Gautam Buddha, a Lao
Tzu, a Zarathustra -- have achieved. I consider it absolutely normal,
not a disease.</p><p>Ta Hui quotes Gautam Buddha, which needs some explanation because you
will not understand it. And I don't think Ta Hui understands it, because
he gives no explanation about it. OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, "THIS WAY
IS ALL RIGHT, AND NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS
WAY, IT IS ALL ALL RIGHT."</p><p>He does not explain why he is quoting this statement. He is simply
throwing names, quotations, which is one of the strategies of
intellectuals to show their knowledgeability. But I don't think he
understands even the meaning of it, because it is one of the most
difficult things to understand.</p><p>Aristotle is said to be the father of Western logic. His logic is the
simplest logic: Black is black, white is white; yes means yes, no means
no -- a clearcut division. It is called twofold logic. Gautam Buddha
believed -- and I think he has far greater insight than Aristotle -- in
a threefold logic. And if you can understand his threefold logic, only
then will this statement become clear to you.</p><p>For example, if somebody asked Gautam Buddha, "Does God exist?",
according to his threefold logic he will answer, "Yes, God exists. No,
God does not exist. Yes and no both: God exists, God does not exist."
Aristotle's logic is twofold: either God exists, or God does not exist.
There is no question of the third possibility, that both may be
right.</p><p>In a certain sense, from a certain angle, it may be said with
absolute truthfulness that God exists, for example if you mean that
existence is intelligent, that existence is not material, that existence
is basically made of consciousness and even matter is only a form of
sleeping consciousness -- consciousness in coma. If you can mean by God,
"universal consciousness," he exists. But you may mean by God, "a person
who created the world"; then God does not exist.</p><p>But it is possible to conceive of God as consciousness, and also not
as a creator, but as the very creativity of existence. It all depends on
us and what we mean by God, because God is only a hypothesis, a word;
the meaning has to be given by us. If God is not a creator and a person
but the very phenomenon of creativity and consciousness, then both are
right: God exists and God does not exist.</p><p>This was the threefold logic. And Gautam Buddha is going to win the
future world over to threefold logic. Aristotle is already out of date.
But Gautam Buddha's contemporary, Mahavira, has a sevenfold logic, and
he is going to be the ultimate winner as far as logic is concerned
because he has gone to all the possible alternatives. These three
alternatives are not all the possibilities. For example, Mahavira's
fourth alternative is: perhaps God is not. And the fifth: perhaps God
exists and is indefinable; he brings indefinability as the fifth
alternative. And the sixth: perhaps God is not, and is still
indefinable. And the seventh: perhaps nothing can be said, only that it
is indefinable. He has covered all the possibilities and
interpretations. Even Gautam Buddha avoided going that far; he remained
within comprehensible limits. Now, seeing his statement, you can
understand it. OLD SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA SAID, "THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT, AND
NOT THIS WAY IS ALL RIGHT TOO; THIS WAY OR NOT THIS WAY, IT IS ALL ALL
RIGHT."</p><p>Three statements ... it makes experience more mysterious. Aristotle
demystifies existence. Just dividing it into life and death, into day
and night, into right and wrong, into good and bad, into God and Devil
is a little childish, a little retarded. Life is more complex than that.
He is only taking the two extremes, and he is forgetting the middle
point.</p><p>Buddha has called his way the middle way, so he has to take into
account the exact middle point where the opposites meet, where
contradictions dissolve into each other and become complementaries. Then
it becomes a threefold logic: two extremes and one where extremes merge
and melt into oneness. His approach is not only more mystical, it is
more scientific too.</p><p>Modern physics is coming closer to Gautam Buddha and completely
abandoning Aristotle. And with Aristotle is also abandoned Euclidean
geometry, because that was a by-product of Aristotelian logic. So
Aristotle and Euclid have reigned for two thousand years in the West,
but modern physics finds that things are more complicated than Aristotle
and Euclid thought. Gautam Buddha perhaps is closer to reality because
he is taking a more mysterious approach. He is broadening our perception
of reality.</p><p>My own feeling is that ultimately modern physics will have to accept
not only Gautam Buddha but Mahavira, because his sevenfold logic is
absolutely complete. You cannot add anything more. There cannot be
eightfold logic; with seven possibilities, all have been covered.
Nothing has been left out, everything has been taken in; it is
all-inclusive. Mahavira has been accepted -- without scientists even
knowing that they are accepting a certain man who lived twenty-five
centuries before, a contemporary of Gautam Buddha -- because he preached
the theory of relativity. Mahavira was the first man to preach the
theory of relativity.</p><p>Albert Einstein would have been immensely happy if somebody had
introduced him to Mahavira's theory of relativity. It is not about
physics, it is about human consciousness, but it is the same standpoint.
And Albert Einstein would have danced if he had heard the sevenfold
logic of Mahavira because he was finding so much difficulty with
Aristotle. Reality was big, and logic was smaller; it was not able to
help in any way to further research going deeper into matter and energy.
It was good for day-to-day work in the marketplace, but it was not good
enough for deeper realms.</p><p>But I think Ta Hui has not got any idea why he has quoted this
statement ... perhaps just to mystify people, just to pretend that he
understands this strange logic of threefoldness, because he does not say
anything about it. It is out of context. Anything said must have some
meaning, some relationship. It is neither related to the previous sutra,
nor is it related to the succeeding sutra. He has just inserted it.</p><p>My feeling is: he simply wants to mystify people, pretending that he
knows great things that they cannot understand. It is one of the
significant things to understand about man that whatever he cannot
understand he thinks must be right. Because of this, philosophers have
been writing in such a way that you will go on reading big phrases, long
phrases, long sentences, big paragraphs -- so big that by the time you
come to the end of the paragraph, you have forgotten the beginning.</p><p>For example, the German philosopher Hegel was a master in mystifying
absolutely nonsensical things, and his whole strategy was just to write
big words, pompous, bombastic. A single sentence would run the whole
page, and by the time you come to the end of the sentence you don't have
any idea what was in the beginning, what was in the middle ...</p><p>Hegel was thought to be a great philosopher -- till he was
understood! When he was understood, he was put aside as just a tricky
fellow, who was only trying to mystify people. And he had succeeded. At
least in his life, he enjoyed the idea of being a great philosopher.
Only after his death slowly, slowly scholars looked into it and found
that he says nothing. He says so much, but if you condense it, your
hands are empty. There is nothing in it.</p><p>Whenever I have thought about Hegel, I have always remembered a man
in my village. He was almost a nutcase; he had crammed the whole Oxford
dictionary, and he used to write letters to the president, to the prime
minister, to the governor. He was living just near my house.</p><p>Once in a while he used to come to me to show me his letters --
twenty pages, thirty pages, fifty foolscap pages typed out, but not a
single sentence making any sense. He knew nothing about language; he
knew everything about the dictionary, and that was the trouble. He would
simply go on writing big words; it made no sense at all.</p><p>He was torturing me, so I said, "You do one thing. I don't have much
time and your letters are too long, and it will be helpful also because
this big letter the President is not going to read. So with the letter
you should write a small summary, just ten lines, twelve lines at the
most."</p><p>He said, "That's a good idea. I will write the summary. That is not a
problem."</p><p>So he went to write the summary, but he left the letter with me. I
was surprised; this is something strange, how is he going to write the
summary? There was no problem for him; the dictionary was with him ...
so another ten lines of absolute absurdity. I said, "This is perfectly
good. This explains everything! And I can say to you that this much the
president is going to read. Twenty pages is too much. You write such
great philosophy."</p><p>But nobody was answering his letters. He would come to me saying,
"Now one month has passed and no answer, not even a receipt that they
have received my letter! And I had been working so hard."</p><p>I said to him, "I don't think these politicians have intelligence
enough to understand your great philosophy."</p><p>He said, "That is right. You are the only man who understands me.
Nobody seems to understand."</p><p>Every day he was going to the collectorate with a new letter and the
collector was tired. One day the collector met me in the library and he
said, "Can't you stop this man? I never read any of his letters, but
even to keep them on the table is a torture. One feels inside one's
stomach some disturbance; just to read two or three lines is enough to
drive anybody crazy."</p><p>I said, "It is very difficult to stop him, because I am the only man
who understands him. If you have any difficulty, I can tell him, and he
can explain."</p><p>He said, "I don't want you to mention it to him at all! He will come
with a bigger explanation."</p><p>Once in a while I used to go to my town, and he used to wait for me.
I loved the man. He was crazy, but very nice and very sweet and
absolutely harmless. I told him, "You have done only one thing
wrong."</p><p>He said, "What?"</p><p>I said, "You should have been born in Germany, and you would have
been known in history as a great philosopher. I have studied all those
great German philosophers; they are all nutcases!"</p><p>One man who was thought to be one of the greatest German philosophers
of this century, Martin Heidegger, started many books, but he never
completed any because by the time he was halfway, he had forgotten what
he had written. So the first volume would be published, and people would
be waiting for the second volume; it never came.</p><p>This went on happening his whole life; he never completed any book.
When asked, he said, "The reality is, I myself forget what I have been
writing. It is so complicated that it is better to start a new book
rather than to read the old one. Let others read ... I don't want to get
involved in it." It will be a great entertainment to you if you read
something of Martin Heidegger.</p><p>And this shows his great "intelligence": he was a follower of Adolf
Hitler, who was certainly a madman! The greatest philosopher follows an
idiot ... it does not show anything about Adolf Hitler, but it shows
something about Martin Heidegger! I have gone through all his works. In
the end your hands are empty. You don't get anything of what he wants to
say, why he wants to say it. Why all this long process of gymnastics
without any conclusion? But these people have been impressing the common
masses.</p><p>My understanding is that whatever people cannot understand they think
must be great. Because we cannot understand, naturally it has to be
something very miraculous, very mysterious. But the truth is always
simple: it is mysterious because it is simple.</p><p>The truth is always obvious.</p><p>It is miraculous because it is obvious, not because it is complex,
not because it is far away.</p><p>It is so close that you tend to forget it. It is within you, so you
don't even bother to look at it.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

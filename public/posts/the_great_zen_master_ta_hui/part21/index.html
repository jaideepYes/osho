But this has not happened yet, because people are too much past-oriented and too much afraid of changing anything. The reason is that they don't have the experience about which they are talking.\"\nI asked Bhadant Anand, \"Do you have the enlightenment that Gautam Buddha had? If you don't have it, then just listen to what I am saying, because I have it.\"\nTa Hui is suffering from his past faults, and he is afraid to say \"Yes,\" because that means he is saying that buddha-nature and the nature of a dog are just the same. It is because of his own guilt that he cannot say the truth.\nBut I don't have any guilt. In fact I don't have any past. Whatever I am saying is exactly the response in this moment, and I don't feel even a single part of me to be reluctant. I am saying it with my whole being. That puts my statements in a totally different category. They are not intellectual, they are not historical, they are not scriptural -- they are existential.\nI am saying it from the same space from where Buddha has spoken, from where Chao Chou has spoken, from where one day Ta Hui is going to speak.\nOkay Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n19\nRadiance\n24 July 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nBELOVED OSHO,\nPRESENT AWARENESS AND COMPARATIVE AWARENESS\nYEN T'OU SAID, \"IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING, IT MUST FLOW OUT POINT BY POINT FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH: ONLY THEN WILL IT BE THE ACTION OF A MAN OF POWER.\" THAT WHICH FLOWS OUT FROM ONE'S OWN BREAST, AS HE CALLS IT, IS ONE'S OWN BEGINNINGLESS PRESENT AWARENESS, FUNDAMENTALLY COMPLETE OF ITSELF. AS SOON AS YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT, YOU FALL INTO THINKING. AWARENESS IS SOMETHING FROM BEFORE YOUR PARENTS WERE BORN.\nTHIS AFFAIR IS NOT A MATTER OF INTELLIGENCE OR ACUITY. ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT THAT'S THE CRITERION. AS SOON AS YOU'VE ATTAINED THIS SCENE, THEN WHATEVER WORDS YOU HAVE, THEY'RE ESTABLISHED. WHEN WHERE THEY'RE ESTABLISHED IS REAL, THIS IS THE SO-CALLED \"FLOWING OUT FROM WITHIN ONE'S OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH.\"\nTruth can never be a missionary, but only a heart-to-heart message -- not to convert the other, but just to share your abundance of love, compassion, blissfulness.\nThis has to be remembered: a missionary is one of the ugliest persons in the world. He himself knows nothing; his heart is empty, but his head is full. He has read, he has studied ... but all the words which are written, howsoever significant, are dead corpses. The scholar is a gravedigger. He brings out skeletons, and he lives amongst skeletons.\nThere is a psychological problem: the man who has not known the truth wants to convince himself that he knows it, and the only way to convince himself that he knows it is to start converting people. It is a feedback system. As more and more people become impressed by his words, by his philosophy, the ultimate outcome is that he becomes convinced that he must have the truth, because so many people could not be idiots.\nI have heard ... Once it happened -- it very rarely happens, just once in a billion years -- that a journalist reached to the gate of heaven. A journalist, by his very profession, is already booked for hell, but there are always accidents ...\nA journalist knocked on the doors of heaven, and Saint Peter opened the door. But seeing the journalist he said, \"Forgive me, we have a quota of only twelve journalists, and it has been full since eternity. Even they are absolutely useless here, because nothing happens in heaven -- no murder, no rape, no robbing, no suicide. So only the first issue of our newspaper was ever published, and that remains relevant forever\" ... because good people don't have stories. To have stories you need bad people. It is unfortunate, but that is how it is.\nThe saints go on sitting in silence. Now, silence is not news; unless there is a riot, a massacre, a war, nuclear weapons, Ronald Reagan, there is no news. Bernard Shaw has defined news: when a dog bites a man it is not news, but when a man bites a dog, it is news. All politicians are news -- they are men biting the dog.\nBut in heaven there is no place for politicians. St. Peter said to the journalist, \"So forgive me, you will have to go to the other door, which is just opposite. There are only two places, not many alternatives to choose from ...\"\nBut you know, journalists are very stubborn people. He insisted, \"At least give me twenty-four hours, just to look around. And after twenty-four hours, if you have some place vacant, you can allow me to remain. Otherwise I will be gone.\"\nIt was not asking too much, so Saint Peter said, \"For twenty-four hours you can be in heaven.\" And immediately the journalist started a rumor that in hell a great new daily newspaper is going to start, and they need a chief editor, they need an editorial board, they need assistant editors, they need all kinds of journalists. Rumor for the journalist is just like water for a fish: he lives in rumors, in lies, in all kinds of things which are not in any way true, but have a quality of sensationalism.\nThere was great commotion, particularly among the twelve journalists. They were tired of heaven, they were tired of dead saints ... Saints can't have any life, because all religions have condemned life. To be a saint, you have to cut your roots from the earth, you have to become a dry bone with no juice in you. The more dead you are, the greater a saint. Any small fragment of life is enough for your fall.\nThose twelve journalists were roaming around for centuries amongst those dead people -- but they could not get any news, nothing was happening. When they heard the rumor, they all became so excited. After twenty-four hours, when our journalist reached the gate, Saint Peter did not open the gate. He said, \"Listen, fellow, now you cannot go out. All the twelve have gone.\"\n\"It seems that in hell they are going to start a very big newspaper on a great scale,\" the journalist said, \"and I don't want to stay here.\" Although he knows he has created the rumor, now the suspicion arises that if so many people believe it -- and even Saint Peter believes it -- there must be some truth in it.\nA missionary is in search of converts, so that he can be convinced that he has the truth. His search for converts is really a psychological need of his own. He is feeling empty and hollow, but if he can manage a few people ... which is always possible.\nThere are people who are in need of a father figure; they themselves feel afraid in life, helpless. Life seems to be too big, unmanageable, that's why they have created a father in God in heaven. But it is so far ... and still no phone connection is available, except to a few very cunning people like the pope, Ayatollah Khomeini, the Shankaracharya of India -- these people have direct lines, invisible. But for the common person, there is no way to communicate; he needs a more visible, more tangible person who can take the place of the father.\nOnly a very few people in the world grow and mature; most remain children, and they need a father to protect them. It is not coincidental that Catholic priests are called fathers. But they don't have wives, they don't have children -- I always wonder how they have become fathers.\nThese Catholics are strange people: they believe in the Virgin Mary, who gives birth to Jesus Christ without any contact with any human being, and becomes a mother without a father. There are these millions of Catholic fathers, and they don't have wives, they don't have children. Catholicism is really mysterious.\nBut to call them \"father\" indicates that inside you is a need for a protective figure. You have been brought up by your father: he was always a protection, a reservoir of knowledge and wisdom. In your eyes he was the greatest man in the world, and you could relax and depend on him. Now the father may be dead.\nPhysically you have grown older, but psychologically the average man is less than thirteen years of age, and that child is hankering for protection. Without protection in this vast universe -- unknown, unpredictable, full of all kinds of diseases, sicknesses, and finally death\n-- a man is bound to be deeply afraid.\nI used to stay in a house, and the woman of the house said to me, \"We have a problem with our child.\" They did not have a bathroom attached to their bedroom; they were old-fashioned people, and they had outhouses far away from the house, at the back. The child was absolutely insistent that when he went in the night to the toilet, the mother or father had to follow him, the doors had to be kept open, and they had to stand there, otherwise he would feel very much afraid.\nI said to him, \"Why don't you do one thing: you are harassing your mother and father, and a simple solution is possible.\"\nHe said, \"I am willing. Just tell me, what is the solution?\"\nI said, \"You can carry a lamp with you, or a torch.\" He laughed. I said, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nHe said, \"In the darkness somehow I can manage to escape from all the ghosts, but with a lamp they will immediately see where I am. You are suggesting a great idea, but I will be caught immediately. I cannot follow this idea. Even if I have to go in darkness, I am willing, because in the darkness I can dodge them. But with a lamp they all will be able to see where I am, and they all will jump on me.\"\nA father is needed. A missionary fulfills some psychologically sick needs of humanity. He is not interested in giving you the truth; he does not have it in the first place.\nIt is very much a mutual conspiracy: you are feeling happy that you have somebody to protect you, a mediator between you and the invisible god, and the missionary is feeling good that so many people believe in his truth -- \"They cannot be wrong. I alone can be wrong, but a multitude of people, the whole congregation of the church, cannot be wrong. It must be that I have the truth.\" So this is a mutual, unconscious arrangement.\nTa Hui is saying something tremendously important. If you want to give the message to people about the great truth, the truth of enlightenment, remember one thing: it should not come from your head, it should not be intellectual jargon. You will be so full of it in your heart that it starts overflowing.\nThen you are not the giver, and you don't have to brag that you have converted so many people. You are not the converter; it is truth itself which is creating the magic of transformation. You are simply a vehicle.\nBut the first thing for you is to be filled with truth, filled with light, filled with fragrance, so that you can share it. In fact, you have to become a rain cloud which becomes heavy with rain and wants to shower. You have to become so heavy with your ultimate experience of freedom, of joy, of blissfulness, of truth, that you want to rain, just like a rain cloud.\nThis is a very significant message and it must have come to Ta Hui as an experience. He was an intellectual, and we are watching a great transformation: an intellectual being transformed slowly, slowly into an enlightened human being. We are watching the birth of a great buddha, the great awakened one.\nThe first sutra: YEN T'OU SAID, \"IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING, IT MUST FLOW OUT POINT BY POINT FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH: ONLY THEN WILL IT BE THE ACTION OF A MAN OF POWER.\"\nYen T'ou is saying that not only is your heart full, it will be so full that it starts radiating in all directions; the whole sky becomes filled with your flavor, with your charisma, with your presence. Those who have eyes will see it, those who have ears will hear it, those who have hearts will feel it, those who have beings, alert and aware, will immediately experience it ... and be transformed, transmuted, into a totally new being -- beyond misery, beyond suffering, beyond agonies -- into a world of ecstasy.\nYou will be so full that the earth and the sky both become filled with your experience, filled with your light, filled with your energy, filled with your radiation.\nYen T'ou is right: In the future, if you want to propagate, don't become a missionary. It is a human weakness to pretend that you are knowledgeable. It is a subtle way of humiliating people: you know, and they don't know. So even if you have got only a little intellectual understanding, you immediately start propagating it because it gives great nourishment for your ego. You start becoming the knower, and everybody else is ignorant.\nIn fact, you are falling into a great ditch. It is better to be ignorant than to be an egoist, because ignorance is natural and can be transformed into innocence very easily. But ego is a perversion: it is very difficult for the egoistic person to understand anything that demands the demolition of ego. Ego is his only treasure; he knows nothing else in the world except his prestige, respectability, knowledgeability, honor.\nIF YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE ... it is not necessary that you propagate. There have been millions of mystics around the world, down the ages, who have decided not to propagate. I cannot say that they are absolutely wrong; they are ninety-nine percent right.\nThey have decided not to propagate because there is no way to explain to you something which you have not experienced. If you have experienced it, there is no need to explain it to you. Their logic is clear. In the East these mystics have been called arhatas. They attain to the ultimate enlightenment and remain silent. If somebody comes to drink out of their well he is welcome, but they do not make any effort on their own to reach people.\nOnly a few people have decided in favor of the one percent possibility: in Buddhism they are called bodhisattvas. They have decided ... It may not be possible to reach to the people's hearts; they are so closed, they have already chosen ... somebody is a Christian, somebody is a Hindu, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Buddhist. They have already chosen without knowing anything. Their minds are prejudiced and polluted, and these prejudices are functioning like walls around them. They don't allow anything new to enter in.\nBut perhaps once in a while you can find a small crack in the wall, and if a person is a seeker, a searcher, open to encounter any truth, then there is a possibility that if you have the truth, his heart will immediately start beating with your heart. It is a synchronicity. Suddenly he will become aware that the man has come for whom he has been waiting and waiting for many lives.\nIt will not be an intellectual conviction, because you have not even spoken. It will be a subtle, invisible transfer -- a transmission of the lamp. The other person just has to be open. You cannot force anybody to be open; the more you try to force, the more closed he will become. It is absolutely in his own hands to be open and vulnerable, to be available just like a womb and to give birth to himself into a new space, a new consciousness.\nThe man of truth can only be a triggering point. That's why Yen T'ou says, IF YOU WANT ... If you don't want, the question does not arise. IF YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING ... And why is he calling it THE GREAT TEACHING? Why not just teaching?\nThis is a difference made very clear by Gautam Buddha. Teaching is from the mind; it is a philosophy, a theology, a religion, but it is from the mind. Mind is immensely capable of fabricating systems of thought, very logical, very rational -- but missing the foundation, the foundation of experience.\nThe great teaching is that which has arisen out of your experience. Its greatness also is that you don't have to make any effort to propagate it. Its very presence starts ringing bells in the hearts of those who are worthy to receive it, who have earned some kind of meditativeness, who have earned some kind of silences of the heart ... whose ground is ready so that the seed of enlightenment can be sown.\nThe teaching is just a rational approach to existence, and the great teaching is an experiential approach to existence.\n\"... TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING, IT MUST FLOW OUT POINT BY POINT FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH: ONLY THEN WILL IT BE THE ACTION OF A MAN OF POWER.\"\nSo much is condensed in this small quotation from Yen T'ou. Scriptures can be made out of the commentary, and out of the implications of it.\nIT MUST FLOW OUT ... You should not make an effort, because your effort will be destroying its beauty, its purity. Your effort means you are not trusting existence and truth. And your hands are very small; your efforts cannot be great enough to transfer the truth.\nIt has to be a flow, point by point. You have just to be a witness, not an active agent; you have just to see the flow from your heart, and rejoice.\nAnd if it reaches to a few hearts, they become joined in a certain mystical union. That's what an authentic commune is -- where people are joined by an invisible flow of energy, from heart to heart. Then they are separate as individuals, and yet deeply connected with each other ... just like a garland of flowers -- each flower is individual, but a thin thread, invisible to the eyes, runs through all of them, and makes it a garland.\nA gathering of disciples has to be a garland. But it is possible not by any effort, not by any action, but only by a spontaneous flow, and it happens on its own. Just like when the rosebud\nopens ... do you think it makes any effort to spread its fragrance to the winds? It happens spontaneously. It is something absolutely natural.\nOnce your heart has become a roseflower and has opened its buds, then the fragrance starts reaching in all directions. This is the right way of sending messages to those who are worthy of receiving them, and only then will it be the action of a man of power. This has to be understood.\nOrdinarily you think a man of power must be a president of a country, or a prime minister, or a great general, or a man like Alexander the Great. Your idea of power is always power over others; it is inhuman and ugly from the very start.\nNobody has the right to have power over anybody else -- neither the husband over the wife, nor the parents over their children, nor any politician over the people. Freedom is our most fundamental right, so that kind of power has to disappear from the world.\nThat power has created thousands of wars, and that power has been our undoing. Man has not been able to use this time for his evolution, for a better earth, for a more human society, without demarcations of nations, religions, political ideologies.\nAll our energy goes into such stupidities! Killing each other seems to be the main purpose of man's being on the earth. In three thousand years there have been five thousand wars. Anybody watching from another planet will think that humanity has gone mad.\nThere is one great thinker of our age, Arthur Koestler, who thinks exactly that -- that something in the growth of man's mind has gone wrong: either the nuts and bolts are too tight or too loose. All our energies devoted to destruction ... what can be more insane? All these energies can make this earth a paradise, but they are making it only a battlefield.\nThis meaning of power is not the same meaning as when Yen T'ou uses the word 'power'. In the East we have used the word power -- not over others, but over oneself. Conquering your own unconquered areas of consciousness, bringing your potential to its total flowering, will make you immensely powerful -- not over anybody, but just a source of power on your own accord.\nPower over others is very impotent: just put the president of any country down from his seat, and all power disappears. What kind of world is this? -- where chairs are powerful, where chairs are more important than man, where chairs make man powerful, not vice-versa. What will Ronald Reagan be without being a president? -- just a senile fellow. What is Richard Nixon? Who cares whether he is alive or dead?\nIt happened before the Russian Revolution that a man named Kerensky was the prime minister of Russia -- a great power. While the revolution was happening he escaped from Russia, and people remained concerned about what happened to him. Perhaps he had been killed -- because no footprints could be found, no sign of where he had disappeared to. He simply disappeared into thin air. It was found in 1960 -- almost half a century after the revolution -- that he was running a grocery store in New York. Of course, under disguise; he was not telling anybody that he had been one of the most powerful men in the world.\nStrange ... but the mystics know of a different kind of power. Wherever the mystic sits, that place becomes holy, that place becomes full of power. The mystic's power is not dependent on any votes, it is not dependent on any chair, it is not dependent on any post. The mystic's power is his own, it is not borrowed.\nEvery president and every prime minister is just a beggar, begging for votes. I have heard about an American politician who was campaigning for his election. He knocked on a door, and he started kissing every child -- and there were at least twenty children with running noses, but one has to tolerate everything if one wants power. He was feeling very much disgusted with the whole affair, but he was smiling -- just like the Jimmy Carter smile.\nHave you heard anything about Jimmy Carter's smile? It has disappeared. I have seen his latest photographs, and only one thing is missing -- that smile. His smile was from ear to ear ... but it was not his smile, it was the chair. With the chair gone, the smile is gone too.\nThe poor politician kissed all the children and the woman who was standing there, then he said to her, \"You have beautiful children. I have come to tell you that your vote should go to me.\"\nHe gave her his card and the woman laughed, saying, \"I will think it over. But these are not all my children; I am just a caretaker. Because all the woman of the neighborhood are having a meeting, they have left their children here, and I am just looking after them.\"\nHe said, \"My God, why didn't you say this before? Now I feel even nauseous! ... these dirty children, with running noses. I have been kissing them, and their mucous was getting on my face.\"\nBut one has to tolerate ...! These beggars become very powerful once they are in the post, but their power is very ugly, inhuman, and brutal.\nThe power of a mystic has a totally different quality, and a different dimension. His power is not dependent on anybody else. His power is not the power of a beggar; his power is the power of an emperor. His power arises within his own being. He becomes a radiant star.\nAll mystics are men of great power. To be in contact with them is enough to be thrilled, to be thrilled about the unknown possibilities of your own being. Just to be in the presence of a man of truth is enough; no argument is needed to convince you -- his presence is the argument, and his power is the convincing force.\nOne great Christian missionary, Stanley Jones, used to stay with me whenever he was passing through the place where I was living. He has written beautiful books and he used to give beautiful sermons. Once I told him, \"You spoke so beautifully! You were using the same words as Jesus ... but I don't see the power behind them, they are just old gramophone records. The words are the same, but the man behind the words is not the same. You use every effort to make your message emphatic, but you don't have the power.\"\nHe was a very sincere man, and he said, \"Perhaps you are right.\"\nI said, \"Not perhaps, I am right. If you had that power, which Jesus had, you would already have been crucified. It is hilarious that you hang a golden cross around your neck. Jesus did not hang a golden cross around his neck; his neck hung on a wooden cross, a cross so heavy that although he was only thirty-three years old -- and the son of a carpenter who was accustomed to carrying big logs from the forest to his father's workshop -- he fell three times, the weight of the cross was so much. Whom are you trying to deceive? Your neck has to be on the cross -- not the cross dangling on your neck, a small cross that cannot kill even a mouse.\"\nThat was the crime of Jesus ... The whole land of the Jews was full of great scholars, intellectuals, great rabbis, and this single man offended them all. He was not speaking against them, he had not said a single word against any of them. But just his presence, his powerful\nindividuality, was enough to reduce them into pygmies -- and all the pygmies joined together to destroy this man.\nPygmies are in the majority in the world, and they have been doing the same down the ages. Socrates they poisoned, because he was a giant. Even today his arguments are so fresh, as fresh as this morning's roses blossoming in the sun and dancing in the air. They murdered al-Hillaj Mansoor, although what he was saying will remain eternally true. He has only declared a simple fact: \"I am God, and you are also God. I know it, you don't know it. Any moment you can recognize it ...\"\nBut the pygmies are feeling very comfortable and cozy in being pygmies. They don't want to take the risk of becoming giants, because they have seen what happens to giants -- crucifixion, poison, murder ... They freak out with these ideas. It is better to be a Christian, with one hour's religion every Sunday; it is better to be a Hindu, it is better to be a Mohammedan. Just belong to a crowd ... because you don't have power, and a man of power stands alone like a lion roaring. He does not need to mix with a crowd.\nTHAT WHICH FLOWS OUT FROM ONE'S OWN BREAST, AS HE CALLS IT, IS\nONE'S OWN BEGINNINGLESS PRESENT AWARENESS ... What starts flowing, the moment you become aware of your awareness, which is beginningless and endless, which is eternity -- as you become aware of your eternal sources of consciousness, inexhaustible, suddenly the flow comes to you without any effort.\nYou are not a missionary; your very being is the mission. You are not trying to convince anybody by your argument; your very being is the answer, self-evident, needing no proof, no argument ... FUNDAMENTALLY, COMPLETE OF ITSELF.\nThe enlightened being, the awakened soul, is complete in itself. It is not in need of anything from anywhere. This gives the awakened person the possibility to be absolutely free of all bondages, of all chains, of all handcuffs. You can put him in a jail, but you cannot enslave his consciousness. Now he no more identifies himself with the body. He has found his real identity. To identify with the body is to carry a false passport.\nBut Ta Hui wants you to be aware not to allow a second thought to arise. What is the second thought? When you first feel yourself in deep meditation, you say, \"Aha, this is it!\" -- and you have missed. This sentence you have to remember not to use at any point, because the moment you say, \"This is it,\" your mind has come in. Mind is the most corrupting force, more poisonous than any cobra. It simply spoils the silence and the meditativeness.\nThere is a tendency in every mind to try it, so one has to be very aware not to give rise to a second thought. Just be alert, just be aware, just be conscious, just be meditative ... but there is no need to reflect about it, or to make a statement about it, or even within yourself to say, \"I have arrived.\"\nAS SOON AS YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT, YOU FALL INTO THINKING. AWARENESS IS SOMETHING FROM BEFORE YOUR PARENTS WERE BORN.\nJesus was asked, \"Who do you think you are? You are just a young man, and the land of Judea has old learned rabbis who have devoted their whole life to looking into the scriptures. Who do you think you are? You don't even have any education, you can't read, you can't write, and you are too young to be wise.\"\nAnd the answer of Jesus is one of the most tremendous answers which has ever been given. He said, \"I have been before Abraham was.\" Abraham is the oldest name in the\ngenealogy of the Jews. \"I was before Abraham was.\" This is a statement of power and self-realization. He is saying, \"I am beginningless. Don't look at my body -- it may be young, but I am eternal.\"\nTHIS AFFAIR IS NOT A MATTER OF INTELLIGENCE OR ACUITY. ACTUALLY, IT IS JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT, THAT IS THE CRITERION.\nTa Hui has come a long, long way. In the beginning, when he was just an intellectual, he was laughing at sudden enlightenment. How can enlightenment be sudden? In existence everything is gradual ... A tree grows gradually, a man grows gradually. It is not that there was nothing and suddenly a rosebush appears -- complete, with the flowers and the fragrance. Existence does not believe in suddenness. It is a gradual process. Intellectually, it seems to be perfectly right.\nBut now he is saying that this is the criterion of whether your enlightenment is true or not: IT IS JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT, THAT IS THE CRITERION -- a sudden\nillumination, just like a bolt of lightning. Now he is speaking from his own experience. As far as mind is concerned, it can observe that everything everywhere grows gradually, so why should there be this exception -- that enlightenment is sudden?\nThe reason is clear: enlightenment is not something that is growing in you; it is something that is already complete, just waiting. It has been complete forever, from the very beginning. You have just to look at it -- a one hundred and eighty-degree turn.\nYou will not find a small plant of enlightenment growing slowly, leaf by leaf, branch by branch. No, you will see the whole complete illumination -- because it is your nature, because it is already there, because it has been there forever. It is just that you were not looking at it; you were standing with your back towards it.\nAnd it cannot grow -- it is complete, it is entire, it is as it should be. The only new thing that is going to happen is not to enlightenment, but to you. You were not aware of it; now you have seen it, now you are aware of it.\nAnd this awareness of yours, is also sudden. You cannot see the enlightenment of your being gradually, piece by piece -- one day you see a little enlightenment, then another day you see a little more, and so on it goes. Once you have seen just a little part of it, you will be pulled completely inwards to recognize its totality.\nIt is very easy, as far as awakening is concerned, to know when a man is only talking intellectually or is talking existentially. Now Ta Hui is talking existentially. It has not only been a great pilgrimage for him, it has been also a great pilgrimage for you all. Seeing how intellect is capable of turning into enlightenment, how an ordinary mind can change into no-mind, how a mortal can become immortal -- it is your story.\nTa Hui is coming to the very end of his pilgrimage. You may be far away from the destination, but Ta Hui's progress will give you tremendous encouragement, however far away you are. He was also very far away, and if he can manage, there is no reason why you cannot manage!\nAS SOON AS YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS SCENE ... Just look at the words, how they change. The intellectual cannot say this; it is just out of his possibilities. He can talk about concepts, he can talk about hypotheses, he can talk about ideologies, but Ta Hui is saying, AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS SCENE ... It is only a scene: it was already there -- you were just not seeing it. Now you have opened your eyes and seen it.\nI have heard about a small child who saw the Catholic priest coming by, and he ran to him and said, \"Father, my dog has given birth to six small kids. And why I am so excited is because they are all Catholics.\"\nThe father said, \"That's very good.\"\nAfter three weeks, the father was coming and he saw the boy sitting on his steps crying. He said, \"What happened? What happened to your six Catholics?\"\nHe said, \"That is why I am crying. Their eyes are now open, and they are no longer Catholics.\"\nTo be a Catholic or to be a Hindu or to be a Mohammedan, your eyes need to be closed, but to be enlightened your eyes need to be open. It is a scene ... the most beautiful scene that you can ever see, or can conceive.\nAS SOON AS YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS SCENE, THEN WHATEVER WORDS\nYOU HAVE, THEY ARE ESTABLISHED. Out of an awakened consciousness, each word is on fire, each word is alive, each word is established. It does not need any support of scriptures, and it does not need any support of anybody else in the world. It is its own authority -- that is the meaning of its being established.\nWHEN WHERE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED IS REAL, THIS IS THE SO-CALLED \"FLOWING OUT FROM WITHIN ONE'S OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND\nEARTH.\" When you are established in truth, you will fill the whole cosmos with your truth, with your ecstasy, with your fragrance. And wherever there are people who are sensitive, they will start searching for the man who has attained the power, and whose words have become established.\nNow, you are here from almost every country of the world. Every government is against me, every government is trying to prevent people reaching here. The government of India is trying to prevent journalists, scholars, professors, all kinds of other news media, from reaching here. They are asking every tourist, \"For what reason are you going to India?\" Just a little suspicion that they are going to meditate, and their application is rejected.\nIt should be counted as one of the most wonderful things ... because meditators have always come to India from all over the world, down the ages. It has been the land of the mystics and the buddhas and the Jainas. Its only contribution to the world is meditation. But this is not a small contribution; it is the greatest contribution possible.\nNow the people -- the so-called political leaders -- who don't know anything about meditation, are ready to give visas to visit the Taj Mahal, Khajuraho, Konarak, Ajanta, Ellora. But I have received letters from people saying that \"because we said we want to learn meditation, our applications were rejected.\" They are not allowing them to come.\nWhen all the governments of the world -- the Indian government included -- are trying to prevent them, still people are finding ways to come. Something is pulling them. Even if the whole world is against me, it does not matter. The people who have a little sensibility, sensitivity, towards higher states of consciousness are bound to come here.\nThis is the power Ta Hui is talking about.\nI don't have any power in the ordinary sense, but I have a power within myself. I am full of my own awakening, and I am willing to share it with anybody. I don't ask whether you are\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6375","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_zen_master_ta_hui/>The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">19 Radiance</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6375 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Zen_Master_Ta_Hui/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

and more valuable. But this has not happened yet, because people are too
much past-oriented and too much afraid of changing anything. The reason
is that they don't have the experience about which they are
talking."</p><p>I asked Bhadant Anand, "Do you have the enlightenment that Gautam
Buddha had? If you don't have it, then just listen to what I am saying,
because I have it."</p><p>Ta Hui is suffering from his past faults, and he is afraid to say
"Yes," because that means he is saying that buddha-nature and the nature
of a dog are just the same. It is because of his own guilt that he
cannot say the truth.</p><p>But I don't have any guilt. In fact I don't have any past. Whatever I
am saying is exactly the response in this moment, and I don't feel even
a single part of me to be reluctant. I am saying it with my whole being.
That puts my statements in a totally different category. They are not
intellectual, they are not historical, they are not scriptural -- they
are existential.</p><p>I am saying it from the same space from where Buddha has spoken, from

ONE'S OWN BEGINNINGLESS PRESENT AWARENESS, FUNDAMENTALLY COMPLETE OF
ITSELF. AS SOON AS YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT, YOU FALL INTO THINKING.
AWARENESS IS SOMETHING FROM BEFORE YOUR PARENTS WERE BORN.</p><p>THIS AFFAIR IS NOT A MATTER OF INTELLIGENCE OR ACUITY. ACTUALLY, IT'S
JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT THAT'S THE CRITERION. AS SOON AS YOU'VE
ATTAINED THIS SCENE, THEN WHATEVER WORDS YOU HAVE, THEY'RE ESTABLISHED.
WHEN WHERE THEY'RE ESTABLISHED IS REAL, THIS IS THE SO-CALLED "FLOWING
OUT FROM WITHIN ONE'S OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH."</p><p><br></p><p>Truth can never be a missionary, but only a heart-to-heart message --
not to convert the other, but just to share your abundance of love,
compassion, blissfulness.</p><p>This has to be remembered: a missionary is one of the ugliest persons
in the world. He himself knows nothing; his heart is empty, but his head
is full. He has read, he has studied ... but all the words which are
written, howsoever significant, are dead corpses. The scholar is a
gravedigger. He brings out skeletons, and he lives amongst
skeletons.</p><p>There is a psychological problem: the man who has not known the truth
wants to convince himself that he knows it, and the only way to convince
himself that he knows it is to start converting people. It is a feedback
system. As more and more people become impressed by his words, by his
philosophy, the ultimate outcome is that he becomes convinced that he
must have the truth, because so many people could not be idiots.</p><p>I have heard ... Once it happened -- it very rarely happens, just
once in a billion years -- that a journalist reached to the gate of
heaven. A journalist, by his very profession, is already booked for
hell, but there are always accidents ...</p><p>A journalist knocked on the doors of heaven, and Saint Peter opened
the door. But seeing the journalist he said, "Forgive me, we have a
quota of only twelve journalists, and it has been full since eternity.
Even they are absolutely useless here, because nothing happens in heaven
-- no murder, no rape, no robbing, no suicide. So only the first issue
of our newspaper was ever published, and that remains relevant forever"
... because good people don't have stories. To have stories you need bad
people. It is unfortunate, but that is how it is.</p><p>The saints go on sitting in silence. Now, silence is not news; unless
there is a riot, a massacre, a war, nuclear weapons, Ronald Reagan,
there is no news. Bernard Shaw has defined news: when a dog bites a man
it is not news, but when a man bites a dog, it is news. All politicians
are news -- they are men biting the dog.</p><p>But in heaven there is no place for politicians. St. Peter said to
the journalist, "So forgive me, you will have to go to the other door,
which is just opposite. There are only two places, not many alternatives
to choose from ..."</p><p>But you know, journalists are very stubborn people. He insisted, "At
least give me twenty-four hours, just to look around. And after
twenty-four hours, if you have some place vacant, you can allow me to
remain. Otherwise I will be gone."</p><p>It was not asking too much, so Saint Peter said, "For twenty-four
hours you can be in heaven." And immediately the journalist started a
rumor that in hell a great new daily newspaper is going to start, and
they need a chief editor, they need an editorial board, they need
assistant editors, they need all kinds of journalists. Rumor for the
journalist is just like water for a fish: he lives in rumors, in lies,
in all kinds of things which are not in any way true, but have a quality
of sensationalism.</p><p>There was great commotion, particularly among the twelve journalists.
They were tired of heaven, they were tired of dead saints ... Saints
can't have any life, because all religions have condemned life. To be a
saint, you have to cut your roots from the earth, you have to become a
dry bone with no juice in you. The more dead you are, the greater a
saint. Any small fragment of life is enough for your fall.</p><p>Those twelve journalists were roaming around for centuries amongst
those dead people -- but they could not get any news, nothing was
happening. When they heard the rumor, they all became so excited. After
twenty-four hours, when our journalist reached the gate, Saint Peter did
not open the gate. He said, "Listen, fellow, now you cannot go out. All
the twelve have gone."</p><p>"It seems that in hell they are going to start a very big newspaper
on a great scale," the journalist said, "and I don't want to stay here."
Although he knows he has created the rumor, now the suspicion arises
that if so many people believe it -- and even Saint Peter believes it --
there must be some truth in it.</p><p>A missionary is in search of converts, so that he can be convinced
that he has the truth. His search for converts is really a psychological
need of his own. He is feeling empty and hollow, but if he can manage a
few people ... which is always possible.</p><p>There are people who are in need of a father figure; they themselves
feel afraid in life, helpless. Life seems to be too big, unmanageable,
that's why they have created a father in God in heaven. But it is so far
... and still no phone connection is available, except to a few very
cunning people like the pope, Ayatollah Khomeini, the Shankaracharya of
India -- these people have direct lines, invisible. But for the common
person, there is no way to communicate; he needs a more visible, more
tangible person who can take the place of the father.</p><p>Only a very few people in the world grow and mature; most remain
children, and they need a father to protect them. It is not coincidental
that Catholic priests are called fathers. But they don't have wives,
they don't have children -- I always wonder how they have become
fathers.</p><p>These Catholics are strange people: they believe in the Virgin Mary,
who gives birth to Jesus Christ without any contact with any human
being, and becomes a mother without a father. There are these millions
of Catholic fathers, and they don't have wives, they don't have
children. Catholicism is really mysterious.</p><p>But to call them "father" indicates that inside you is a need for a
protective figure. You have been brought up by your father: he was
always a protection, a reservoir of knowledge and wisdom. In your eyes
he was the greatest man in the world, and you could relax and depend on
him. Now the father may be dead.</p><p>Physically you have grown older, but psychologically the average man
is less than thirteen years of age, and that child is hankering for
protection. Without protection in this vast universe -- unknown,
unpredictable, full of all kinds of diseases, sicknesses, and finally
death</p><p>-- a man is bound to be deeply afraid.</p><p>I used to stay in a house, and the woman of the house said to me, "We
have a problem with our child." They did not have a bathroom attached to
their bedroom; they were old-fashioned people, and they had outhouses
far away from the house, at the back. The child was absolutely insistent
that when he went in the night to the toilet, the mother or father had
to follow him, the doors had to be kept open, and they had to stand
there, otherwise he would feel very much afraid.</p><p>I said to him, "Why don't you do one thing: you are harassing your
mother and father, and a simple solution is possible."</p><p>He said, "I am willing. Just tell me, what is the solution?"</p><p>I said, "You can carry a lamp with you, or a torch." He laughed. I
said, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>He said, "In the darkness somehow I can manage to escape from all the
ghosts, but with a lamp they will immediately see where I am. You are
suggesting a great idea, but I will be caught immediately. I cannot
follow this idea. Even if I have to go in darkness, I am willing,
because in the darkness I can dodge them. But with a lamp they all will
be able to see where I am, and they all will jump on me."</p><p>A father is needed. A missionary fulfills some psychologically sick
needs of humanity. He is not interested in giving you the truth; he does
not have it in the first place.</p><p>It is very much a mutual conspiracy: you are feeling happy that you
have somebody to protect you, a mediator between you and the invisible
god, and the missionary is feeling good that so many people believe in
his truth -- "They cannot be wrong. I alone can be wrong, but a
multitude of people, the whole congregation of the church, cannot be
wrong. It must be that I have the truth." So this is a mutual,
unconscious arrangement.</p><p>Ta Hui is saying something tremendously important. If you want to
give the message to people about the great truth, the truth of
enlightenment, remember one thing: it should not come from your head, it
should not be intellectual jargon. You will be so full of it in your
heart that it starts overflowing.</p><p>Then you are not the giver, and you don't have to brag that you have
converted so many people. You are not the converter; it is truth itself
which is creating the magic of transformation. You are simply a
vehicle.</p><p>But the first thing for you is to be filled with truth, filled with
light, filled with fragrance, so that you can share it. In fact, you
have to become a rain cloud which becomes heavy with rain and wants to
shower. You have to become so heavy with your ultimate experience of
freedom, of joy, of blissfulness, of truth, that you want to rain, just
like a rain cloud.</p><p>This is a very significant message and it must have come to Ta Hui as
an experience. He was an intellectual, and we are watching a great
transformation: an intellectual being transformed slowly, slowly into an
enlightened human being. We are watching the birth of a great buddha,
the great awakened one.</p><p>The first sutra: YEN T'OU SAID, "IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU WANT TO
PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING, IT MUST FLOW OUT POINT BY POINT FROM
WITHIN YOUR OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH: ONLY THEN WILL IT BE
THE ACTION OF A MAN OF POWER."</p><p>Yen T'ou is saying that not only is your heart full, it will be so
full that it starts radiating in all directions; the whole sky becomes
filled with your flavor, with your charisma, with your presence. Those
who have eyes will see it, those who have ears will hear it, those who
have hearts will feel it, those who have beings, alert and aware, will
immediately experience it ... and be transformed, transmuted, into a
totally new being -- beyond misery, beyond suffering, beyond agonies --
into a world of ecstasy.</p><p>You will be so full that the earth and the sky both become filled
with your experience, filled with your light, filled with your energy,
filled with your radiation.</p><p>Yen T'ou is right: In the future, if you want to propagate, don't
become a missionary. It is a human weakness to pretend that you are
knowledgeable. It is a subtle way of humiliating people: you know, and
they don't know. So even if you have got only a little intellectual
understanding, you immediately start propagating it because it gives
great nourishment for your ego. You start becoming the knower, and
everybody else is ignorant.</p><p>In fact, you are falling into a great ditch. It is better to be
ignorant than to be an egoist, because ignorance is natural and can be
transformed into innocence very easily. But ego is a perversion: it is
very difficult for the egoistic person to understand anything that
demands the demolition of ego. Ego is his only treasure; he knows
nothing else in the world except his prestige, respectability,
knowledgeability, honor.</p><p>IF YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE ... it is not necessary that you propagate.
There have been millions of mystics around the world, down the ages, who
have decided not to propagate. I cannot say that they are absolutely
wrong; they are ninety-nine percent right.</p><p>They have decided not to propagate because there is no way to explain
to you something which you have not experienced. If you have experienced
it, there is no need to explain it to you. Their logic is clear. In the
East these mystics have been called arhatas. They attain to the ultimate
enlightenment and remain silent. If somebody comes to drink out of their
well he is welcome, but they do not make any effort on their own to
reach people.</p><p>Only a few people have decided in favor of the one percent
possibility: in Buddhism they are called bodhisattvas. They have decided
... It may not be possible to reach to the people's hearts; they are so
closed, they have already chosen ... somebody is a Christian, somebody
is a Hindu, somebody is a Mohammedan, somebody is a Buddhist. They have
already chosen without knowing anything. Their minds are prejudiced and
polluted, and these prejudices are functioning like walls around them.
They don't allow anything new to enter in.</p><p>But perhaps once in a while you can find a small crack in the wall,
and if a person is a seeker, a searcher, open to encounter any truth,
then there is a possibility that if you have the truth, his heart will
immediately start beating with your heart. It is a synchronicity.
Suddenly he will become aware that the man has come for whom he has been
waiting and waiting for many lives.</p><p>It will not be an intellectual conviction, because you have not even
spoken. It will be a subtle, invisible transfer -- a transmission of the
lamp. The other person just has to be open. You cannot force anybody to
be open; the more you try to force, the more closed he will become. It
is absolutely in his own hands to be open and vulnerable, to be
available just like a womb and to give birth to himself into a new
space, a new consciousness.</p><p>The man of truth can only be a triggering point. That's why Yen T'ou
says, IF YOU WANT ... If you don't want, the question does not arise. IF
YOU WANT TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING ... And why is he calling it
THE GREAT TEACHING? Why not just teaching?</p><p>This is a difference made very clear by Gautam Buddha. Teaching is
from the mind; it is a philosophy, a theology, a religion, but it is
from the mind. Mind is immensely capable of fabricating systems of
thought, very logical, very rational -- but missing the foundation, the
foundation of experience.</p><p>The great teaching is that which has arisen out of your experience.
Its greatness also is that you don't have to make any effort to
propagate it. Its very presence starts ringing bells in the hearts of
those who are worthy to receive it, who have earned some kind of
meditativeness, who have earned some kind of silences of the heart ...
whose ground is ready so that the seed of enlightenment can be sown.</p><p>The teaching is just a rational approach to existence, and the great
teaching is an experiential approach to existence.</p><p>"... TO PROPAGATE THE GREAT TEACHING, IT MUST FLOW OUT POINT BY POINT
FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND EARTH: ONLY THEN WILL IT
BE THE ACTION OF A MAN OF POWER."</p><p>So much is condensed in this small quotation from Yen T'ou.
Scriptures can be made out of the commentary, and out of the
implications of it.</p><p>IT MUST FLOW OUT ... You should not make an effort, because your
effort will be destroying its beauty, its purity. Your effort means you
are not trusting existence and truth. And your hands are very small;
your efforts cannot be great enough to transfer the truth.</p><p>It has to be a flow, point by point. You have just to be a witness,
not an active agent; you have just to see the flow from your heart, and
rejoice.</p><p>And if it reaches to a few hearts, they become joined in a certain
mystical union. That's what an authentic commune is -- where people are
joined by an invisible flow of energy, from heart to heart. Then they
are separate as individuals, and yet deeply connected with each other
... just like a garland of flowers -- each flower is individual, but a
thin thread, invisible to the eyes, runs through all of them, and makes
it a garland.</p><p>A gathering of disciples has to be a garland. But it is possible not
by any effort, not by any action, but only by a spontaneous flow, and it
happens on its own. Just like when the rosebud</p><p>opens ... do you think it makes any effort to spread its fragrance to
the winds? It happens spontaneously. It is something absolutely
natural.</p><p>Once your heart has become a roseflower and has opened its buds, then
the fragrance starts reaching in all directions. This is the right way
of sending messages to those who are worthy of receiving them, and only
then will it be the action of a man of power. This has to be
understood.</p><p>Ordinarily you think a man of power must be a president of a country,
or a prime minister, or a great general, or a man like Alexander the
Great. Your idea of power is always power over others; it is inhuman and
ugly from the very start.</p><p>Nobody has the right to have power over anybody else -- neither the
husband over the wife, nor the parents over their children, nor any
politician over the people. Freedom is our most fundamental right, so
that kind of power has to disappear from the world.</p><p>That power has created thousands of wars, and that power has been our
undoing. Man has not been able to use this time for his evolution, for a
better earth, for a more human society, without demarcations of nations,
religions, political ideologies.</p><p>All our energy goes into such stupidities! Killing each other seems
to be the main purpose of man's being on the earth. In three thousand
years there have been five thousand wars. Anybody watching from another
planet will think that humanity has gone mad.</p><p>There is one great thinker of our age, Arthur Koestler, who thinks
exactly that -- that something in the growth of man's mind has gone
wrong: either the nuts and bolts are too tight or too loose. All our
energies devoted to destruction ... what can be more insane? All these
energies can make this earth a paradise, but they are making it only a
battlefield.</p><p>This meaning of power is not the same meaning as when Yen T'ou uses
the word 'power'. In the East we have used the word power -- not over
others, but over oneself. Conquering your own unconquered areas of
consciousness, bringing your potential to its total flowering, will make
you immensely powerful -- not over anybody, but just a source of power
on your own accord.</p><p>Power over others is very impotent: just put the president of any
country down from his seat, and all power disappears. What kind of world
is this? -- where chairs are powerful, where chairs are more important
than man, where chairs make man powerful, not vice-versa. What will
Ronald Reagan be without being a president? -- just a senile fellow.
What is Richard Nixon? Who cares whether he is alive or dead?</p><p>It happened before the Russian Revolution that a man named Kerensky
was the prime minister of Russia -- a great power. While the revolution
was happening he escaped from Russia, and people remained concerned
about what happened to him. Perhaps he had been killed -- because no
footprints could be found, no sign of where he had disappeared to. He
simply disappeared into thin air. It was found in 1960 -- almost half a
century after the revolution -- that he was running a grocery store in
New York. Of course, under disguise; he was not telling anybody that he
had been one of the most powerful men in the world.</p><p>Strange ... but the mystics know of a different kind of power.
Wherever the mystic sits, that place becomes holy, that place becomes
full of power. The mystic's power is not dependent on any votes, it is
not dependent on any chair, it is not dependent on any post. The
mystic's power is his own, it is not borrowed.</p><p>Every president and every prime minister is just a beggar, begging
for votes. I have heard about an American politician who was campaigning
for his election. He knocked on a door, and he started kissing every
child -- and there were at least twenty children with running noses, but
one has to tolerate everything if one wants power. He was feeling very
much disgusted with the whole affair, but he was smiling -- just like
the Jimmy Carter smile.</p><p>Have you heard anything about Jimmy Carter's smile? It has
disappeared. I have seen his latest photographs, and only one thing is
missing -- that smile. His smile was from ear to ear ... but it was not
his smile, it was the chair. With the chair gone, the smile is gone
too.</p><p>The poor politician kissed all the children and the woman who was
standing there, then he said to her, "You have beautiful children. I
have come to tell you that your vote should go to me."</p><p>He gave her his card and the woman laughed, saying, "I will think it
over. But these are not all my children; I am just a caretaker. Because
all the woman of the neighborhood are having a meeting, they have left
their children here, and I am just looking after them."</p><p>He said, "My God, why didn't you say this before? Now I feel even
nauseous! ... these dirty children, with running noses. I have been
kissing them, and their mucous was getting on my face."</p><p>But one has to tolerate ...! These beggars become very powerful once
they are in the post, but their power is very ugly, inhuman, and
brutal.</p><p>The power of a mystic has a totally different quality, and a
different dimension. His power is not dependent on anybody else. His
power is not the power of a beggar; his power is the power of an
emperor. His power arises within his own being. He becomes a radiant
star.</p><p>All mystics are men of great power. To be in contact with them is
enough to be thrilled, to be thrilled about the unknown possibilities of
your own being. Just to be in the presence of a man of truth is enough;
no argument is needed to convince you -- his presence is the argument,
and his power is the convincing force.</p><p>One great Christian missionary, Stanley Jones, used to stay with me
whenever he was passing through the place where I was living. He has
written beautiful books and he used to give beautiful sermons. Once I
told him, "You spoke so beautifully! You were using the same words as
Jesus ... but I don't see the power behind them, they are just old
gramophone records. The words are the same, but the man behind the words
is not the same. You use every effort to make your message emphatic, but
you don't have the power."</p><p>He was a very sincere man, and he said, "Perhaps you are right."</p><p>I said, "Not perhaps, I am right. If you had that power, which Jesus
had, you would already have been crucified. It is hilarious that you
hang a golden cross around your neck. Jesus did not hang a golden cross
around his neck; his neck hung on a wooden cross, a cross so heavy that
although he was only thirty-three years old -- and the son of a
carpenter who was accustomed to carrying big logs from the forest to his
father's workshop -- he fell three times, the weight of the cross was so
much. Whom are you trying to deceive? Your neck has to be on the cross
-- not the cross dangling on your neck, a small cross that cannot kill
even a mouse."</p><p>That was the crime of Jesus ... The whole land of the Jews was full
of great scholars, intellectuals, great rabbis, and this single man
offended them all. He was not speaking against them, he had not said a
single word against any of them. But just his presence, his powerful</p><p>individuality, was enough to reduce them into pygmies -- and all the
pygmies joined together to destroy this man.</p><p>Pygmies are in the majority in the world, and they have been doing
the same down the ages. Socrates they poisoned, because he was a giant.
Even today his arguments are so fresh, as fresh as this morning's roses
blossoming in the sun and dancing in the air. They murdered al-Hillaj
Mansoor, although what he was saying will remain eternally true. He has
only declared a simple fact: "I am God, and you are also God. I know it,
you don't know it. Any moment you can recognize it ..."</p><p>But the pygmies are feeling very comfortable and cozy in being
pygmies. They don't want to take the risk of becoming giants, because
they have seen what happens to giants -- crucifixion, poison, murder ...
They freak out with these ideas. It is better to be a Christian, with
one hour's religion every Sunday; it is better to be a Hindu, it is
better to be a Mohammedan. Just belong to a crowd ... because you don't
have power, and a man of power stands alone like a lion roaring. He does
not need to mix with a crowd.</p><p>THAT WHICH FLOWS OUT FROM ONE'S OWN BREAST, AS HE CALLS IT, IS</p><p>ONE'S OWN BEGINNINGLESS PRESENT AWARENESS ... What starts flowing,
the moment you become aware of your awareness, which is beginningless
and endless, which is eternity -- as you become aware of your eternal
sources of consciousness, inexhaustible, suddenly the flow comes to you
without any effort.</p><p>You are not a missionary; your very being is the mission. You are not
trying to convince anybody by your argument; your very being is the
answer, self-evident, needing no proof, no argument ... FUNDAMENTALLY,
COMPLETE OF ITSELF.</p><p>The enlightened being, the awakened soul, is complete in itself. It
is not in need of anything from anywhere. This gives the awakened person
the possibility to be absolutely free of all bondages, of all chains, of
all handcuffs. You can put him in a jail, but you cannot enslave his
consciousness. Now he no more identifies himself with the body. He has
found his real identity. To identify with the body is to carry a false
passport.</p><p>But Ta Hui wants you to be aware not to allow a second thought to
arise. What is the second thought? When you first feel yourself in deep
meditation, you say, "Aha, this is it!" -- and you have missed. This
sentence you have to remember not to use at any point, because the
moment you say, "This is it," your mind has come in. Mind is the most
corrupting force, more poisonous than any cobra. It simply spoils the
silence and the meditativeness.</p><p>There is a tendency in every mind to try it, so one has to be very
aware not to give rise to a second thought. Just be alert, just be
aware, just be conscious, just be meditative ... but there is no need to
reflect about it, or to make a statement about it, or even within
yourself to say, "I have arrived."</p><p>AS SOON AS YOU AROUSE A SECOND THOUGHT, YOU FALL INTO THINKING.
AWARENESS IS SOMETHING FROM BEFORE YOUR PARENTS WERE BORN.</p><p>Jesus was asked, "Who do you think you are? You are just a young man,
and the land of Judea has old learned rabbis who have devoted their
whole life to looking into the scriptures. Who do you think you are? You
don't even have any education, you can't read, you can't write, and you
are too young to be wise."</p><p>And the answer of Jesus is one of the most tremendous answers which
has ever been given. He said, "I have been before Abraham was." Abraham
is the oldest name in the</p><p>genealogy of the Jews. "I was before Abraham was." This is a
statement of power and self-realization. He is saying, "I am
beginningless. Don't look at my body -- it may be young, but I am
eternal."</p><p>THIS AFFAIR IS NOT A MATTER OF INTELLIGENCE OR ACUITY. ACTUALLY, IT
IS JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT, THAT IS THE CRITERION.</p><p>Ta Hui has come a long, long way. In the beginning, when he was just
an intellectual, he was laughing at sudden enlightenment. How can
enlightenment be sudden? In existence everything is gradual ... A tree
grows gradually, a man grows gradually. It is not that there was nothing
and suddenly a rosebush appears -- complete, with the flowers and the
fragrance. Existence does not believe in suddenness. It is a gradual
process. Intellectually, it seems to be perfectly right.</p><p>But now he is saying that this is the criterion of whether your
enlightenment is true or not: IT IS JUST AN ABRUPT BURSTING OUT, THAT IS
THE CRITERION -- a sudden</p><p>illumination, just like a bolt of lightning. Now he is speaking from
his own experience. As far as mind is concerned, it can observe that
everything everywhere grows gradually, so why should there be this
exception -- that enlightenment is sudden?</p><p>The reason is clear: enlightenment is not something that is growing
in you; it is something that is already complete, just waiting. It has
been complete forever, from the very beginning. You have just to look at
it -- a one hundred and eighty-degree turn.</p><p>You will not find a small plant of enlightenment growing slowly, leaf
by leaf, branch by branch. No, you will see the whole complete
illumination -- because it is your nature, because it is already there,
because it has been there forever. It is just that you were not looking
at it; you were standing with your back towards it.</p><p>And it cannot grow -- it is complete, it is entire, it is as it
should be. The only new thing that is going to happen is not to
enlightenment, but to you. You were not aware of it; now you have seen
it, now you are aware of it.</p><p>And this awareness of yours, is also sudden. You cannot see the
enlightenment of your being gradually, piece by piece -- one day you see
a little enlightenment, then another day you see a little more, and so
on it goes. Once you have seen just a little part of it, you will be
pulled completely inwards to recognize its totality.</p><p>It is very easy, as far as awakening is concerned, to know when a man
is only talking intellectually or is talking existentially. Now Ta Hui
is talking existentially. It has not only been a great pilgrimage for
him, it has been also a great pilgrimage for you all. Seeing how
intellect is capable of turning into enlightenment, how an ordinary mind
can change into no-mind, how a mortal can become immortal -- it is your
story.</p><p>Ta Hui is coming to the very end of his pilgrimage. You may be far
away from the destination, but Ta Hui's progress will give you
tremendous encouragement, however far away you are. He was also very far
away, and if he can manage, there is no reason why you cannot
manage!</p><p>AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS SCENE ... Just look at the words,
how they change. The intellectual cannot say this; it is just out of his
possibilities. He can talk about concepts, he can talk about hypotheses,
he can talk about ideologies, but Ta Hui is saying, AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
ATTAINED THIS SCENE ... It is only a scene: it was already there -- you
were just not seeing it. Now you have opened your eyes and seen it.</p><p>I have heard about a small child who saw the Catholic priest coming
by, and he ran to him and said, "Father, my dog has given birth to six
small kids. And why I am so excited is because they are all
Catholics."</p><p>The father said, "That's very good."</p><p>After three weeks, the father was coming and he saw the boy sitting
on his steps crying. He said, "What happened? What happened to your six
Catholics?"</p><p>He said, "That is why I am crying. Their eyes are now open, and they
are no longer Catholics."</p><p>To be a Catholic or to be a Hindu or to be a Mohammedan, your eyes
need to be closed, but to be enlightened your eyes need to be open. It
is a scene ... the most beautiful scene that you can ever see, or can
conceive.</p><p>AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS SCENE, THEN WHATEVER WORDS</p><p>YOU HAVE, THEY ARE ESTABLISHED. Out of an awakened consciousness,
each word is on fire, each word is alive, each word is established. It
does not need any support of scriptures, and it does not need any
support of anybody else in the world. It is its own authority -- that is
the meaning of its being established.</p><p>WHEN WHERE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED IS REAL, THIS IS THE SO-CALLED
"FLOWING OUT FROM WITHIN ONE'S OWN BREAST TO COVER HEAVEN AND</p><p>EARTH." When you are established in truth, you will fill the whole
cosmos with your truth, with your ecstasy, with your fragrance. And
wherever there are people who are sensitive, they will start searching
for the man who has attained the power, and whose words have become
established.</p><p>Now, you are here from almost every country of the world. Every
government is against me, every government is trying to prevent people
reaching here. The government of India is trying to prevent journalists,
scholars, professors, all kinds of other news media, from reaching here.
They are asking every tourist, "For what reason are you going to India?"
Just a little suspicion that they are going to meditate, and their
application is rejected.</p><p>It should be counted as one of the most wonderful things ... because
meditators have always come to India from all over the world, down the
ages. It has been the land of the mystics and the buddhas and the
Jainas. Its only contribution to the world is meditation. But this is
not a small contribution; it is the greatest contribution possible.</p><p>Now the people -- the so-called political leaders -- who don't know
anything about meditation, are ready to give visas to visit the Taj
Mahal, Khajuraho, Konarak, Ajanta, Ellora. But I have received letters
from people saying that "because we said we want to learn meditation,
our applications were rejected." They are not allowing them to come.</p><p>When all the governments of the world -- the Indian government
included -- are trying to prevent them, still people are finding ways to
come. Something is pulling them. Even if the whole world is against me,
it does not matter. The people who have a little sensibility,
sensitivity, towards higher states of consciousness are bound to come
here.</p><p>This is the power Ta Hui is talking about.</p><p>I don't have any power in the ordinary sense, but I have a power
within myself. I am full of my own awakening, and I am willing to share
it with anybody. I don't ask whether you are</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

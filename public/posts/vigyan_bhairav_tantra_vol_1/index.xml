WHAT IS THIS LIFE BEYOND FORM PERVADING FORMS?
HOW MAY WE ENTER IT FULLY, ABOVE SPACE AND TIME, NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS? LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED!

Fulfillment through becoming centered
13 November 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
Question 1
IS SELF-ACTUALIZATION A BASIC NEED?
There are many questions. The first: IS SELF-ACTUALIZATION A BASIC NEED OF MAN? First, try to understand what is meant by self-actualization. A. H. Maslow has used this term “self- actualization.” Man is born as potentiality. He is not really actual – just potential.</description>

17. UNMINDING MIND, KEEP IN THE MIDDLE – UNTIL.

Beyond mind to the source
15 November 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
There are many questions. The first question:
Question 1
LAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT WITH THE DAWN OF ENLIGHTENMENT, THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO EYEBROWS, THE THIRD EYE, BECOMES ALL INCLUSIVE. THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT ALL ENLIGHTENED ONES ARE CENTERED IN THEIR NAVEL, AND ON STILL ANOTHER DAY YOU HAVE EXPLAINED ABOUT THE SILVER CORD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPINE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Entering the inner centering
16 November 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
18. LOOK LOVINGLY AT SOME OBJECT. DO NOT GO TO ANOTHER OBJECT. HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT – THE BLESSING.
19. WITHOUT SUPPORT FOR FEET OR HANDS, SIT ONLY ON THE BUTTOCKS. SUDDENLY, THE CENTERING.
20. IN A MOVING VEHICLE, BY RHYTHMICALLY SWAYING, EXPERIENCE. OR IN A STILL VEHICLE, BY LETTING YOURSELF SWING IN SLOWING INVISIBLE CIRCLES.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Changing the direction of energy
17 November 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
Question 1
IF ENLIGHTENMENT AND SAMADHI MEAN TOTAL CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, ALL-PERVADING CONSCIOUSNESS, THEN IT SEEMS VERY STRANGE TO CALL THIS STATE OF COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS CENTERING, AS THE WORD ‘CENTERING’ IMPLIES ONE-POINTEDNESS. WHY IS COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, OR SAMADHI, CALLED CENTERING?
Centering is the path, not the goal. Centering is the method, not the result.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
THE LAST TECHNIQUE YOU DISCUSSED YESTERDAY SAID THAT WHEN A MOOD AGAINST SOMEONE OR FOR SOMEONE ARISES, NOT TO PLACE IT ON THE PERSON IN QUESTION BUT TO REMAIN CENTERED. BUT WHEN WE EXPERIMENT WITH THIS TECHNIQUE ON OUR ANGER, HATRED, ETC., WE FEEL THAT WE ARE SUPPRESSING OUR EMOTION AND IT BECOMES A SUPPRESSED COMPLEX.</description>

1. JUST AS YOU HAVE THE IMPULSE TO DO SOMETHING, STOP.
2. WHEN SOME DESIRE COMES, CONSIDER IT. THEN, SUDDENLY, QUIT IT.
3. ROAM ABOUT UNTIL EXHAUSTED AND THEN, DROPPING TO THE GROUND, IN THIS DROPPING BE WHOLE.
Life has two balances: one is of being and the other of doing. Your being is your nature.</description>

A Technique for the intellectual and a technique for the feeling type
12 December 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
SUTRAS:
4. SUPPOSE YOU ARE GRADUALLY BEING DEPRIVED OF STRENGTH OR OF KNOWLEDGE. AT THE INSTANT OF DEPRIVATION, TRANSCEND.
5. DEVOTION FREES.
For tantra, man himself is the disease. It is not that your mind is disturbed – rather, your mind is the disturbance.</description>

The Path of Yoga and the Path of Tantra
2 October 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
Many questions are there. The first:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL YOGA AND TANTRA? ARE THEY THE SAME?
Tantra and yoga are basically different. They reach to the same goal; however, their paths are not only different, but contrary also. So this has to be understood very clearly.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO EYES WITH THE THIRD EYE. IN WHICH WAY DO THE TECHNIQUES CONCERNED WITH LOOKING AFFECT THE THIRD EYE?

23. ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS SOUND, ALL SOUNDS.

The first question:
Question 1
BELOVED MASTER, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHETHER THE TECHNIQUES YOU HAVE DISCUSSED SO FAR FROM VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA BELONG TO THE SCIENCE OF YOGA INSTEAD OF TO THE ACTUAL AND CENTRAL SUBJECT MATTER OF TANTRA. WHAT IS THE CENTRAL SUBJECT MATTER OF TANTRA?
This question arises to many.</description>

The spirituality of the tantric sex act
22 February 1973 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
AT THE START OF SEXUAL UNION KEEP ATTENTIVE ON THE FIRE IN THE BEGINNING, AND SO CONTINUING, AVOID THE EMBERS IN THE END.
WHEN IN SUCH EMBRACE YOUR SENSES ARE SHAKEN AS LEAVES, ENTER THIS SHAKING. EVEN REMEMBERING UNION, WITHOUT THE EMBRACE, TRANSFORMATION.
ON JOYOUSLY SEEING A LONG ABSENT FRIEND, PERMEATE THIS JOY.</description>

“Cosmic orgasm” through Tantra
23 February 1973 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
BEGIN.…
Before I take your questions some other points have to be clarified, because those points will help you understand more what tantra means. Tantra is not a moral concept. It is neither moral nor immoral. It is amoral. It is a science, and science is neither. Your moralities and concepts concerning moral behavior are irrelevant for tantra.</description>

24 February 1973 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
OH LOTUS-EYED ONE, SWEET OF TOUCH, WHEN SINGING, SEEING, TASTING, BE AWARE YOU ARE AND DISCOVER THE EVER-LIVING.
WHEREVER SATISFACTION IS FOUND, IN WHATEVER ACT, ACTUALIZE THIS.
AT THE POINT OF SLEEP, WHEN THE SLEEP HAS NOT YET COME AND THE EXTERNAL WAKEFULNESS VANISHES, AT THIS POINT BEING IS REVEALED.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
“IN WHICH WAY CAN THE PRACTICE OF SELF-REMEMBERING TRANSFORM THE HUMAN MIND?”
Man is not centered in himself. He is born centered, but the society, the family, the education, the culture, they push him off-center, and they put him off-center in a very cunning way, knowingly or unknowingly.</description>

IN MOODS OF EXTREME DESIRE, BE UNDISTURBED.
THIS SO-CALLED UNIVERSE APPEARS AS A JUGGLING, A PICTURE SHOW. TO BE HAPPY, LOOK UPON IT SO.
OH BELOVED, PUT ATTENTION NEITHER ON PLEASURE NOR ON PAIN, BUT BETWEEN THESE.

Toward the authentic being
27 February 1973 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
The first question:
Question 1
“IN WHICH WAY DOES THE MODERNIZED ORIGINAL MIND BECOME IDENTIFIED WITH THE DUST OF THE PAST KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE?”
Mind is pure, and no impurity can enter it. That is impossible. The mind is just the buddha-nature – the ultimate. And when I say “mind,” I don’t mean your mind, I simply mean the mind where no I and you exist.</description>

SUTRAS
AS WAVES COME WITH WATER AND FLAMES WITH FIRE, SO THE UNIVERSAL WAVES WITH US.
WHEREVER YOUR MIND IS WANDERING, INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY, AT THIS VERY PLACE, THIS.
WHEN VIVIDLY AWARE THROUGH SOME PARTICULAR SENSE, KEEP IN THE AWARENESS.
Sri Aurobindo says somewhere that the whole life is yoga – and it is so.</description>

The deceptions of the mind
4 October 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
Question 1
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT BY SIMPLY BECOMING AWARE AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE BREATHING PROCESS ONE CAN ATTAIN ENLIGHTENMENT? HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO BECOME FREE FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS BY JUST BEING AWARE OF SUCH A SMALL AND MOMENTARY GAP IN THE BREATHING?
This question is significant, and this question is likely to have occurred to many minds, so many things have to be understood.</description>

Five techniques of attentiveness
5 October 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
5. ATTENTION BETWEEN EYEBROWS, LET MIND BE BEFORE THOUGHT. LET FORM FILL WITH BREATH ESSENCE TO THE TOP OF THE HEAD AND THERE SHOWER AS LIGHT.
6. WHEN IN WORLDLY ACTIVITY, KEEP ATTENTION BETWEEN TWO BREATHS, AND SO PRACTICING, IN A FEW DAYS BE BORN ANEW.
7. WITH INTANGIBLE BREATH IN CENTER OF FOREHEAD, AS THIS REACHES HEART AT THE MOMENT OF SLEEP, HAVE DIRECTION OVER DREAMS AND OVER DEATH ITSELF.</description>

Devices to transcend dreaming
6 October 1972 pm in Woodlands, Bombay
One friend has asked, Question 1
WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS WHICH CAN MAKE ONE CONSCIOUS WHILE DREAMING?
This is a significant question for all those who are interested in meditation, because meditation is really a transcending of the process of dreaming. You are constantly dreaming – not only in the night, not only while you are asleep; you are dreaming the whole day.</description>

Question 1
WHAT DOES TANTRA MEAN BY PURITY?
One of the things being asked about is: WHAT DOES TANTRA MEAN BY PURIFICATION OF THE MIND, PURITY OF THE MIND, AS A BASIC CONDITION TO FURTHER PROGRESS? Whatsoever
is ordinarily meant by purity is not what is meant by tantra. Ordinarily, we divide everything into bad and good.</description>

13. OR, IMAGINE THE FIVE-COLORED CIRCLES OF THE PEACOCK TAIL TO BE YOUR FIVE SENSES IN ILLIMITABLE SPACE. NOW LET THEIR BEAUTY MELT WITHIN. SIMILARLY, AT ANY POINT IN SPACE OR ON A WALL – UNTIL THE POINT DISSOLVES. THEN YOUR WISH FOR ANOTHER COMES TRUE.
14. PLACE YOUR WHOLE ATTENTION IN THE NERVE, DELICATE AS THE LOTUS THREAD, IN THE CENTER OF YOUR SPINAL COLUMN.</description>

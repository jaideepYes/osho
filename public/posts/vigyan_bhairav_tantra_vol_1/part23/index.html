THEN.\nWe live on the surface of ourselves – just at the fringe, the boundary. The senses are just on the boundary and your consciousness is way deep down at the center. We live in the senses; that is natural. But that is not the ultimate flowering, it is just the beginning. And when we are living in the senses, we are basically concerned with objects, because senses are irrelevant unless there is concern with some object of enjoyment. For example, eyes are useless unless there is something to be seen, ears are useless unless there is something to be heard, and hands are useless unless there is something to be touched.\nWe live in the senses; therefore, we have to live in objects. The senses are just on the boundary of the being, in the body, and objects are not even on the boundary: they are beyond the boundary. So three points have to be understood before we enter the techniques.\nFirst, the consciousness is at the center. Second, the senses through which the consciousness moves out are at the boundary. And third, the objects in the world to which the consciousness\nmoves, through the senses, are beyond the boundary. These three things have to be remembered: consciousness at the center, senses at the boundary and objects beyond the boundary. Try to understand it clearly, because then the techniques will be very simple.\nLook at it from many directions. One: senses are just in between, just in the middle. At one side is consciousness, at another side is the world of objects. Senses are just in the middle – between the two. From the senses you can move either way: either you can go to the objects or you can go to the center. Either way the distance is the same. From the senses, doors open both ways – move to the objects or move to the center.\nYou are at the senses. That is why one of the most famous Zen Masters, Bokuju, has said that NIRVANA and the world are the same distance away. So do not think that the nirvana is very far away. The world and the nirvana, this world and that other world, are both at the same distance.\nThis saying has created much confusion because we feel that nirvana is very, very far away - that Moksha, liberation, the kingdom of God, is very, very far away. We feel that the world is just near, just here. But Bokuju says, and he says rightly, that both are at the same distance.\nThe world is here, and nirvana is also here. The world is near, and nirvana is also near, For nirvana you have to move inwards, for the objects you have to move outwards; the distance is the same. From my eyes, my center is just as near as you are near me. I can see you if I move outward, I can see myself if I move inward. And we are at the doors of the senses, but naturally, the bodily needs are such that consciousness moves outwards. You need food, you need water to drink, you need a house where to live. These are your bodily needs and these can only be found in the world, so quite naturally, consciousness moves through the senses toward the world. Unless you create a need which can only be fulfilled when you move inward, you will never move inward.\nFor example, if a child were born self-sufficient, if he didn’t need any food, he would not look at his mother at all. The mother would become irrelevant, meaningless, because for the child the mother is not the meaning: food is the meaning. The mother is his first food, and because the mother gives him food and satisfies a basic need, without which he will die, he starts loving the mother. That love comes secondly, as a shadow, because the mother is fulfilling a basic need.\nSo those mothers who are feeding their children through bottles should not expect much love because for the child food is the need, not the mother. The mother will come into his being, enter into his being only through food. That is why food and love are deeply related-very, very deeply related. If your love need is fulfilled, you will need less food. If your love need is not fulfilled, you will need more food. So those who love and who are loved will not gather much fat. There are other reasons also, but this is one of the most basic. They will not eat much. If love is not fulfilled, then food becomes a substitute. Then they will eat much.\nFor the child, food is the basic need. But if a child should be born who can be self-sufficient, who does not need any food, who does not need any outward help to be alive, he will not move in the world at all. Do you think he will move? There would be no need. And unless a need is there, the energy will never move. We move outwardly not because we are sinners. We move outwardly because we have needs which can be fulfilled only through objects-which can be gained if we move in the world of objects.\nWhy do you not move inward? Because you have not yet created the need to move inward. Once the need is there, it is as easy to move inward as to move outward. What is that need? That need is concerned with religion. You cannot be religious unless that need is there. How is that need created? By what process does one become aware of a deep need which helps you move inward?\nThree things are to be remembered. Firstly, death. Remember, all life-needs force you to move outward. If you want to move inward, death must become a basic concern; otherwise you cannot move inward. That is why it happened that persons like Buddha, who became deeply conscious of death, started moving inward. Only when you become aware of death will you create the need to look back.\nLife looks outward. Unless you become aware of death, religion is meaningless for you. That is why animals have no religion. They are alive, they are as much alive as man, or even more, but they cannot be conscious of death, they cannot conceive of death, they cannot see death in the future. They see that others are dying, but it never occurs to the animal mind that this death is an indication of his death also.\nFor the animal mind death always occurs to others. And if for you also death is just something which happens to others, you still live in the animal mind. If you are not aware of death, you have not yet become man. That is the basic difference between animal and man-because animal cannot be aware of death, only man can be. If you are not aware of death you are not a man yet, and only man creates the need to move inward.\nTo me, man means awareness of death. I am not saying become afraid of death; that is not awareness. Just be aware of the fact that death is coming nearer and nearer and you have to be prepared for it.\nLife has its own needs; death creates its own needs. That is why younger societies are irreligious – because younger societies are not yet aware of the phenomenon of death; it has not become a central concern for them. An older society – for example, India, one of the oldest societies in existence – is so much aware of death. Because of that awareness, deep down India is religious. So the first thing: become aware of death. Think about it, look at it, contemplate it. Do not be afraid, do not escape the fact. It is there and you cannot escape it! It has come into existence with you.\nYour death is born with you; now you cannot escape it. You have hidden it in yourself – become aware of it. The moment you become aware that you are going to die, that death is certain, your total mind will start looking in a different dimension. Then food is a basic need for the body, but not for the being, because even if you get food death will occur. Food cannot protect you from death, food can only postpone. Food can help you to postpone. If you get a good shelter, a good house, it will not protect you from death. it will only help you to die conveniently, comfortably. And death, whether it happens comfortably or uncomfortably, is the same.\nIn life you may be poor or rich, but death is the great equalizer. The greatest communism is in death. Howsoever you live, it makes no difference; death happens equally. In life, equality is impossible; in death, inequality is impossible. Become aware of it, contemplate it. And it is not only that death is certain somewhere in the future: with the idea that it is very far away, you will again not be able to contemplate it. The mind has a very small range; the focus of the mind is very small. You cannot\nthink beyond thirty years. After thirty years there will be death... it is as if you are not going to die. Thirty years is so long, the distance is so much, it is as if death is not going to occur.\nIf you want to contemplate death, know another fact about it: it can occur the next moment; it is possible the very next moment. You may not be able to hear my whole sentence, I may not be able to complete it. My mother’s father used to tell me that when I was born he consulted one astrologer, one of the best known astrologers of those days. The astrologer was to make my KUNDALI – birth chart. But the astrologer studied it and he said, “If this child survives after seven years, only then will I make the chart. It seems impossible that he can survive for more than seven years, so it is useless. If the child is going to die in seven years it is useless to make the kundali; it will be of no use. And it has been my habit,” the astrologer said, “that unless I am certain that the kundali will be useful I never make it.” So he didn’t make it.\nFortunately, or unfortunately, I survived. Then my mother’s father went to the astrologer, but he was dead, so he never could make my kundali. He was dead, and I have been constantly wondering about this. He was aware of the fact that this child may die, but he was not aware of the fact that he may die. He was not aware! It seems that he was absolutely unconcerned – and he was no ordinary man. But no one is concerned with his own death. Knowingly, cunningly, we are not concerned with it because it creates a fear. So I have always suspected that that astrologer might have never looked at his own kundali; otherwise he would have become aware.\nDeath is possible the very next moment, but the mind will not believe it. I say it and your mind will say, “No! How is it possible the next moment? It is far away.” But that is a trick. If you postpone, you cannot contemplate. It must be so near that you can focus on it. And when I say that the next moment it is possible, I mean it. It can happen, and whenever it will happen it will be the next moment. Just before it, you could not have conceived that it was going to happen.\nA person is dying: just a moment before he could never have thought that death is so near. It always happens in the next moment – remember. It has always happened that way, and this will be the way always. It always happens in the next moment. Bring it near so that you can focus on it, and that very focusing will help you to enter in, a new need will be created.\nSecondly, you go on living. You go on creating artificial meanings and purposes for this very moment. You never think of your life as a whole, whether it has any meaning or not. You go on creating new meanings, and you push yourself on with those meanings. That is why a poor man lives a more meaningful life than a rich man – because a poor man has many things to get, and that gives a meaning to his life. If you are really rich, it means you have everything that is possible and this world cannot offer anything to you. Then your life becomes meaningless. Now you cannot create any meaning for this moment, for this day, to help you live. That is why the richer a society, the more affluent a culture, the more meaninglessness is felt. Poorer societies never feel meaninglessness.\nA poor man is concerned with having a house. For years together he will work for it. His life has a meaning; something has to be achieved. And when he gets the house he will be happy for a few days at least, but then bigger houses are there... So he will go on moving, doing this and that, never thinking about his life as a whole, whether it has any meaning or not. He never takes life as a whole.\nJust imagine that you have everything – the house, the car that you long for, and all your dreams are fulfilled. So now what? Just imagine that whatsoever you need is there, you have it. Now what?\nSuddenly meaning disappears. You are standing on an abyss; nothing can be done. You become meaningless. You are already meaningless, just not aware. Even if you get the whole world, then what? What is fulfilled?\nAlexander was coming to India, and he met a great saint, Diogenes. Diogenes was one of the most penetrating minds ever born. He lived naked like Mahavir; he is the Mahavir of Greek civilization and culture. He left everything, renounced everything, not because through renouncing things he was going to get anything – that is not real renouncing, not authentic renunciation. If you renounce something to get something, that is a bargain. If you think that you are going to have some reservation in heaven and that is why you renounce, it is not renunciation. If you renounce the bodily pleasures to have spiritual pleasures, this is not renunciation.\nDiogenes renounced everything, not because out of it he was going to get something. He renounced just to see if when he has nothing, whether there is any meaning or not. He thought that if one possesses nothing, if even then one has a meaning, a purpose, a destiny, then death cannot annihilate anything, because death can annihilate only a possessions and the body is also possession. He left everything. He had only one thing: a wooden bowl out of which to drink water. He thought, “This is not much of a possession.” Then one day he saw a child drinking water with his hands. He immediately threw away the bowl. He said, “If a child can drink water with his hands, am I more weak than a child?”\nWhen Alexander was coming to India to conquer, to make a world empire, somebody informed him that just on the way, where he would be stopping, there lived a great sage who was just the opposite of him. He was told, “You are going to make a world empire, and he has even thrown away his bowl because he says that as he is happy without it, why carry this burden? And you say that unless the whole world becomes your empire, you cannot be happy. So he is just at the opposite pole, and it would be good if you meet him.”\nAlexander was fascinated. It happens that the opposite always fascinates. The opposite always fascinates; it has a deep sexual attraction. Just a man is attracted to woman or woman is attracted to man, there is the same attraction with the opposite. Alexander could not by-pass Diogenes, but it was not good for him to go to Diogenes, and it was impossible that Diogenes would come to him – there was no solution.\nDiogenes was informed. Many, many messengers came to inform him that “The Great Alexander is passing this way. It would be good if you meet him.” He said, “The Great Alexander? Who has said this to you! I think he himself has. So tell your Great Alexander that he has nothing to give to me, and there is no need for him to meet me – and I am a very small man.” He used to say, “Really, I am a dog, not a man at all – just a dog, so there is no need. It is below his dignity to meet this dog.”\nThen Alexander had to come. Diogenes is reported to have said, “I hear you are going to win the whole world, so I thought, I closed my eyes and thought, ‘Okay! If I have won the whole world, then what?’ This has been my problem constantly: if I have won the whole world, then what?” It is reported that Alexander, after hearing this, became very sad. “Then what?” he said to Diogenes. “Do not talk such things. You make me very sad.”\nDiogenes said, “But you will become very sad when you win the whole world. What can I do? I am\njust imagining, and I have come to conclude that this is useless. You are making a suicidal effort. You yourself are trying to win the whole world – so then what? If you succeed, then what? ”\nAlexander returned from Diogenes very disturbed, upset, sad. He said to his companions, “This man is very dangerous. He has shattered my dreams.” And he could never forget, could never forgive Diogenes. The day he died, he remembered him again, and he said, “It may be that that fellow was right: then what ?”\nSo the next thing is to remember always that whatsoever you are doing, whatsoever you are achieving, remember to ask, “If I succeed, then what?” Is there any meaning in it all, or is there just some artificial meaning given by you only to divide, to create an illusion around you so that you feel you are doing something worthwhile – and all the time you are really wasting life and energy, not doing anything worthwhile! There is only one thing worthwhile: if you can become happy without anything, without any dependence: if you can be blissful alone, totally alone. If nothing is needed for your bliss, only then can you be blissful; otherwise you will be in misery, always in misery.\nDependence is misery, and those who depend on possessions, those who depend on accumulated knowledge, those who depend on this or that, they are helping their own misery to become accumulated more and more. So the next point to remember is to ask whether you have any meaning, or whether you are just floating along without any meaning. Are you just making believe that this or that is the meaning of your existence?\nOne man used to come to me. He used to say that if his son gets into college, that would be all and he would be very happy. He was a poor man, a very ordinary clerk, and that was the only dream, that his son would get into college. Then the son got into college. Now the son has become a forest official. A few months back the son was here and he told me, “I am getting only six hundred rupees per month. I have two children and this is my only dream, that they can get a good education; that is all. I am working hard. If they can be well educated and if I can send one of my children to some foreign country to study, that is all I ask.”\nHis father is no more; he has died. This was his meaning in life, his purpose – to make his boy educated and well placed. Now the boy is well placed, and now the boy has the same purpose, to help his children become educated and well placed. And he will die, and those children will go on doing the same nonsense.\nWhat is the meaning of all this? What are you doing? Just passing time? Just destroying life? Or have you got some authentic meaning which you can say makes you happy, blissful? This is the second consideration which will turn you inward.\nAnd thirdly, man goes on forgetting. You go on forgetting things. You were angry yesterday, and you repented it. Now you have forgotten, and if the same stimulus is given again, you will be angry again. This has been so for your whole life: you go on repeating the same things.\nIt is said that it is very extraordinary to find a man who learns through life – very rare. Really, no one learns. If you learn, then you cannot commit the same mistake twice. But you go on committing the same thing again and again. Rather, the more you commit, the more you become prone to commit it. You are angry again and again, and again and again you repent it, and you have not learned\nanything. Given the stimulus, you will be angry, and you will do the same madness, and then you will repent again – that is also part of it. And then you will again be ready to be stimulated and to be angry.\nThe third thing: if you want to turn in, learn! Whatsoever you are doing, learn through it. Take the essential out of it. Look back at what have you been doing with your life and your energy and your time. The same mistakes, the same foolishnesses, the same stupidities, again and again.\nSo you move in a wheel. However, it is not good to say that you move the wheel: rather, the wheel moves you. Mechanically, you go on and on and on. That is why in India we have called the world SANSAR. SANSAR means the wheel which goes on, and you are just clinging to some spoke on it and you go on moving.\nUnless you learn something about this wheel, this vicious circle, this sansar, unless you learn something about it, you will not leave the spoke and jump out of it. So three words, three key words:\nDeath: make it a constant contemplation. Meaning: go on searching for it in your life.\nAnd learn: learn through your life, because there is no other learning. Scriptures won’t give you anything.\nIf your own life cannot give you something, nothing can give it to you. Learn through your own life, conclude through it. What have you been doing with yourself? If you are in a wheel, jump out of it. But to know that you are in a wheel, you will have to go deep into understanding and learning. These three things will help you to turn in.\nNow the techniques:\nSIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY.\nThat is why I have said so many things – because the techniques are very easy, and you can do them and nothing will result. Then you will say, “What type of techniques are these? We can do them, they are so simple. SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE SKY, THE BLUE SKY, BEYOND THE\nCLOUDS, THE SERENITY: one will become silent and serene, fulfilled.”\nYou can look at the blue sky beyond the clouds and nothing will happen. Then you will say, “What type of technique is this? Shiva is not talking rationally, reasonably. He is saying anything, whatsoever comes to his mind. What kind of technique is this – SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY. One will become serene!”\nBut if you remember: death, meaning, learning, this technique will help you immediately to turn in. LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS... Just looking, not thinking. The sky is infinite; it ends nowhere. Just look into it. There is no object; that is why the sky is chosen. The sky is not an object. Linguistically it is; existentially, the sky is not an object because an object begins and ends.\nYou can go around an object; you cannot go around the sky. You are in the sky, but you cannot go around it. So you may be the object for the sky, but the sky cannot be your object. You can look into it, but you cannot look at it, and that looking into it goes on and on... it never ends.\nSo look into the blue sky and go on looking. The object is infinite, there is no boundary to it. Do not think about it; do not say it is beautiful. Do not say, “How lovely!” Do not appreciate the color; do not start thinking. If you start thinking, you have stopped. Now your eyes are not moving into the blue, the infinite blue. Just move, just look – do not think. Do not create words; they will become barriers. Not even “blue sky” should be said. Do not verbalize.\nThere should be just a pure, innocent look into the blue sky. It never ends. You will go on and on and on and on, and suddenly, because there is no object, just a vacuum, suddenly you will become aware of yourself. Why? Because if there is any vacuum your senses become useless. Senses are only useful if there is an object.\nIf you are looking at a flower, then you are looking at something – the flower is there. The sky is not there. What do we mean by a sky? That which is not there. Sky means the space. All objects are in the sky, but the sky is not an object. It is just the vacuum, the space in which objects can exist. The sky itself is just pure emptiness. Look at this pure emptiness. That is why the sutra says: BEYOND THE CLOUDS. Because clouds are not the sky, they are objects floating in the sky. You can look at the clouds, but that will not help. Look into the blue sky – not at the stars, not at the moon, not at the clouds, but at objectlessness, emptiness. Look into it.\nWhat will happen? In emptiness, there is no object to be grasped by the senses. Because there is no object to be grasped, clung to, senses become futile. And if you are looking into the blue sky without thinking, without thinking, suddenly you will feel that everything has disappeared; there is nothing. In that disappearance you will become aware of yourself. Looking into this emptiness, you will become empty. Why? Because your eyes are like a mirror. Whatsoever is before them is reflected. I see you and you are sad – then a sudden sadness enters into me. If a sad person enters into your room, you become sad. What has happened? You have looked at sadness. You are like a mirror: the sadness is reflected in you.\nSomeone laughs heartily – suddenly you feel a laughter coming to you also. It has become infectious. What has happened? You are like a mirror, you are reflecting things. You look at a beautiful object – it is reflected in you. You look at an ugly object – it is reflected in you. Whatsoever you are seeing penetrates deep into you. It becomes part of your consciousness.\nIf you are looking into the emptiness, there is nothing to be reflected - or only the blue infinite sky. If it is reflected, if you feel the blue infinite sky within, you will become serene, you will find serenity. That is there. And if really you can conceive of emptiness - where sky, blue, everything disappears: just at emptiness - inside also emptiness will be reflected. And in emptiness, how can you be worried, how can you be tense?\nIn emptiness, how can the mind function? It stops; it disappears. In the disappearance of the mind - the mind that is tense, worried, filled with thoughts that are relevant, irrelevant - in that disappearance of the mind, THE SERENITY.\nOne thing more. Emptiness, if reflected in, becomes desirelessness. Desire is tension. You desire and you become worried. You look at a beautiful woman – a sudden desire arises. You look at a beautiful house – you want to possess it. You look at a beautiful car just passing by your side – you want to be in it, you want to drive it. A desire has come in, and with the desire mind becomes worried: “How to get it? What to do to get it?” The mind becomes frustrated or hopeless or hopeful, but it is all dreaming. Many things can happen.\nWhen desire is there, you are disturbed. The mind is shattered into fragments, and many plans, dreams, projections start; you become mad. Desire is the seed of madness.\nBut emptiness is not an object; it is just emptiness. When you look at emptiness, no desire arises; it cannot arise. You do not want to possess emptiness, you do not want to love emptiness, you do not want to make a house out of it. Emptiness? You cannot do anything with it! All movement of the mind stops, no desire arises, and with the non-arising of desire, THE SERENITY. You become silent, serene. A sudden peace explodes in you. You have become like the sky.\nAnother thing. Whatsoever you contemplate, you become like it, you become that, because mind can take infinite forms. Whatsoever you desire, your mind takes its form, you become it. That is why a person who is just after riches, gold, after money, his mind becomes just a treasure - nothing else. Shake him, and you will feel the rupees inside - the sound of rupees, nothing else. Whatsoever you desire, you become that. So be conscious of what you are desiring because you are becoming that.\nThe sky is the most empty thing. It is just near you and it costs nothing, and you do not have to go somewhere – to the Himalayas or to Tibet – to find the sky. They have destroyed everything, technology has destroyed everything, but the sky is still there; you can use it. Use it before they destroy it – any day they will destroy it. Look, penetrate into it. And the look must be a non-thinking one, remember this. Then you will feel the same sky within, the same dimension within, the same space and blueness and emptiness. That is why Shiva says, SIMPLY.\nSIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY.\nThe next technique:\nLISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. EYES STILL, WITHOUT WINKING, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.”\nLISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. This is a secret method. In\nthis esoteric tantra, the master gives you the teaching secretly, the doctrine secretly – or the mantra secretly. When the disciple is ready, then the mantra, or the supreme secret, will be imparted, communicated to him, privately. Just in his ear it will be whispered. This technique is concerned with that whispering. LISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED.\nWhen the master has decided that now you are ready and the secret of his own experience can be communicated, when the moment has come when he can say to you that which is unsayable, then this technique has to be used. EYES STILL, WITHOUT WINKING, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE. When master, is imparting his secret to you in your ear, whispering it, let your eyes be totally still: no movement of the eyes. That means the mind should be quiet, thoughtless.\nNo winking – not even a slight movement, because that will show a disturbance within. Just become an empty ear with no movement within. The consciousness is just waiting to be impregnated, just open, receptive, passive... no activity on its own part. And when this will happen, this moment when you are totally empty, not thinking anything but just waiting... not waiting for something, because then it will become thinking, not waiting for something but just waiting; when this static moment, this non-dynamic moment will happen; when everything has stopped, time is not flowing and mind is totally vacant – it becomes no-mind. Only into a no-mind can a master impart.\nAnd he is not going to give a very long discourse: he will give just one or two or three words. In that silence those one, two or three words will penetrate to your very core, to the very center, and they will become a seed there. In this passive awareness, in this silence, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.\nOne can become free only by becoming free of the mind; there is no other freedom. Freedom from the mind is the only freedom. Mind is the bondage, the slavery, the servitude. So a disciple has to wait with his master for the right moment when he will call him and impart. He is not to ask, because asking means desire. He is not to expect, because expectation means conditions, desire, mind. He is just to wait. And when he will be ready, when his waiting will become total, the master can do anything.\nSometimes the master can do very trivial things, and the thing will happen. And ordinarily, even if a Shiva goes on talking about one hundred and twelve methods, nothing will happen because the preparation is not there. You can throw seeds on stones, but nothing will happen. The fault is not of the seeds. You can throw a seed out of season, but nothing will happen. The fault is not of the seed. The right season is needed, the right moment is needed, the right soil is needed. Only then will the seed become alive and transform.\nSo sometimes very trivial things work. For example, Lin Chi became enlightened while he was just sitting on his master’s verandah - on the verandah of his master, and the Master came out and just laughed. He looked at Lin Chi - into his eyes - and laughed uproariously. Lin Chi started laughing, bowed down, and left. But he had been waiting there for six years: that verandah was his abode for six years.\nThe master would come day after day, month after month, and he would not even look at him. And Lin Chi was waiting there. Then after two years, for the first time he looked at him. Then two more years passed, and for the first time he patted him. Then Lin Chi waited and waited, and after six years, one day suddenly he came out, stared into Lin Chi’s eyes, and Lin Chi must have done this technique: LISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. EYES STILL, WITHOUT WINKING, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.\nThe master looked and used laughter as a medium. He was a great master. Really, words were not needed, just laughter. Suddenly there was that laughter, and something happened in Lin Chi. He bowed down, laughed, left, and told everyone that now he was no more, that he was liberated, free. He was no more: that is what liberation means. You are not liberated. You are liberated from yourself.\nLin Chi used to tell how it happened. For six years he was waiting. It was a long waiting, a patient waiting. He was just waiting on the verandah, and every day the master would come. And he would\nwait for the right moment – when he would become ready, then the master would do something. Just by waiting for six years, you will fall into meditation. What can you do? He might have thought for a few days about old things, but if you do not give new food every day to the mind, by and by it stops. How long can you chew again and again on the same thing?\nHe might have been thinking about past things, and by and by, because no new stimulus was given, thinking stopped. He was not allowed to read, he was not allowed to talk, he was not allowed to move and meet anyone. He was just allowed to fulfill the basic bodily needs and wait on the verandah.\nSilently he waited, day after day – day in, day out, day and night. Summer would come and pass away, and winter would come and pass away, and there would be rain and it would pass away: he must have forgotten time. He must have forgotten for how many days he had been there. And then one day suddenly the master appeared, and he looked deeply into his eyes. Lin Chi’s eyes must have suddenly become static, non-dynamic. This was the moment; six years were wasted for this. There was no movement of the eyes, because a single movement and he may miss. Everything must have become silent – and then suddenly, the uproarious laughter: the master began laughing madly. That laughter must have been heard deep down at the very core; it must have reached.\nSo when Lin Chi was asked, “What happened to you?” he said, “When my master laughed, suddenly I recognized that the whole world is just a joke. In his laughter, this was the message: The whole world is just a joke, just a drama. An seriousness disappeared. And if the whole world is just a joke, who is in bondage? And who needs to be free?” So Lin Chi said, “There was no bondage at all. I was thinking that I was bound, and that is why I was trying to be free, and then suddenly the master laughed and the bondage fell away.”\nSometimes it has happened with such things; you can never conceive of how it was possible. There are many Zen stories... One Zen master became aware when the gong was beaten. Just while he was hearing the gong being beaten, the sound, something shattered in him. One Zen nun became aware, enlightened, while she was carrying two pails of water. Suddenly the bamboo broke, and the earthen pots fell down. The sound, the breaking of the pots and the water flowing out of them, and she became enlightened.\nWhat happened? You can break many pots, but nothing will happen. A right moment had come. She was coming back. Her master had said, “This night I am going to give you the secret, so go and take a bath, and bring two pails of water for me. I will take a bath and impart to you the secret for which you have been waiting.” She must have felt ecstatic – the moment had come. She took a bath, filled the pots, and carried them back.\nIt was a full-moon night, and just when she was passing on the footpath from the river to the ashram, suddenly the bamboo broke. When she reached, the master was waiting, and he looked at her and he said, “Now there is no need, it has happened. Now I have nothing to convey. You have already received.”\nThat old nun used to say, “With that bamboo breaking, something broke in me – something broke in me also. Those pails falling down, those broken earthen pots, and I saw my body broken. I looked at the moon. Everything was silent, serene, and I became silent and serene. From that moment, I have not been, I am no more.” This is what liberation, freedom means.\nThe next technique:\nAT THE EDGE OF A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS DEPTHS UNTIL – THE WONDROUSNESS.\nThe techniques are similar, with a slight difference. AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS DEPTHS UNTIL – THE WONDROUSNESS. Look into a deep well. The well will be reflected in you. Forget thinking completely; stop thinking completely. Just go on looking into the depth. Now they say mind has its own depth, like a well. Now in the West, they are developing depth psychology. They say mind is not just a surface. It is just a beginning; there are depths – many depths, hidden depths.\nLook into a well without thinking. The depth will be reflected in you, the well will become just an outer symbol of the inner depth. And go on looking UNTIL - THE WONDROUSNESS, until you feel wonder-filled.\nDo not stop before this moment. Go on looking, go on looking, go on looking, day after day, month after month. Just go to a well, look deep, with no thoughts moving in the mind. Just meditate. Just meditate on the depth: meditate the depth, become one with it. Go on meditating; one day your thoughts will not be there. Any moment it can happen. Suddenly you will feel you have the same well within you, the same depth. And then a strange, very strange feeling will come to you: you will feel wonder-filled.\nChuang Tzu was passing over a bridge with his master, Lao Tsu. Lao Tsu is reported to have said to Chuang Tzu, “Remain here. Go on looking down from this bridge to the river until the river stops and the bridge starts flowing. Then come to me.” The river is flowing; the bridge never flows. But Chuang Tzu was given this meditation - to wait on this bridge. It is said he made a hut on the bridge and remained there. Months passed... he would just sit on the bridge, looking down for the moment when the river would stop and the bridge would flow. Then he would go to the master.\nOne day it happened: the river stopped and the bridge started flowing. How can it happen? If thought stops completely, then anything is possible, because really, it is fixedness of thought which says that the river is flowing and the bridge is static. This is just relative - just relative!\nEinstein says, and physics says, that everything is relative. You are traveling in a train, a fast train. What happens? The trees flow by, they run by. And if the train is really smooth and you do not feel that the train is running, you are just looking through the windows, the trees are moving, not the train.\nEinstein has said that if in space two trains are running, or two spaceships are running side by side with the same speed, you will not be able to feel that they are moving. You can feel a moving train because you see the static things by the side. If there is nothing - for example, if the trees are also moving in the same direction with the same speed - you will feel static. Or when a train passes in the opposite direction, your speed is doubled. You feel your train has become faster.\nIt has not become faster. It is the same train with the same speed, but a train going in the opposite direction gives you the feeling of double speed. If speed is relative, then it is just a fixedness of the mind to think that the river is flowing and the bridge is static.\nContinuously meditating, meditating, meditating, Chuang Tzu came to realize that everything is relative. The river is flowing because you take the bridge as static. The bridge is also flowing deep down. Nothing is static in this world. Atoms are moving, electrons are moving; the bridge is a constant movement within. Everything is flowing; the bridge is also flowing.\nChuang Tzu must have had a glimpse of the atomic structure of the bridge. Now they say this wall which looks static is not static. Movement is there, every electron is running, but the movement is so fast you cannot see it. That is why you feel it as static.\nIf this fan goes on with a faster movement, faster and faster, you will not be able to see its wings, the spaces between them. You will not be able to see this. And if it moves with the speed of light, you will see simply one circular disc that is static. Nothing will be moving in it because eyes cannot catch that fast movement.\nSo Chuang Tzu must have had a glimpse of the atomic structure of the bridge. He waited and waited, and the fixed mind dissolved. Then he saw that the bridge was flowing - and the movement was so fast that the river was just static in comparison to it. He came running to Lao Tsu and Lao Tsu said, “Okay! Now do not ask me. The thing has happened to you.” What had happened? No-mind had happened.\nIn this technique, AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS DEPTH UNTIL\n- THE WONDROUSNESS. When you feel wonder-filled, when the mystery descends upon you, when mind is no more but simply mystery - a milieu of mystery – then you will be capable of knowing yourself.\nAnother technique:\nLOOK UPON SOME OBJECT, THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM IT, THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR THOUGHT FROM IT. THEN.\nLook upon some object. Look at a flower, but remember what that LOOK means. Look! Do not think. I need not repeat it. Always remember that look means: look, do not think. If you think, it is not a look; then you have contaminated everything. It must be a pure look, a simple look.\nLOOK UPON SOME OBJECT. Look at a flower,- a roseflower. THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM IT - very slowly. The flower is there – first look at it. Drop thinking; go on looking. When you feel that now there is no thought, simply the flower is there in your mind, nothing else, now slightly move your eyes away. By and by the flower recedes, goes out of focus, but the image will remain with you. The object will have gone out of focus; you will have turned your look away. The image, the outer flower is no more there, but it is reflected - reflected in your mirror of consciousness. It will be there! THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM IT, THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR THOUGHT FROM IT.\nSo first, withdraw from the outer object. Then only the inner image remains - the thought of the roseflower. Now withdraw that thought also. This is very difficult, the second part, but if the first part is done exactly as it is said, it will not be so difficult. First withdraw your mind from the object, your sight. Then close your eyes, and just as you have removed your eyesight from the object, remove\nyourself from the image. Withdraw yourself; become indifferent. Do not look at it inside, just feel that you have gone away from it. Soon the image will also disappear.\nFirst the object disappears, then the image disappears. And when the image disappears, Shiva says, THEN. Then you are left alone. In that aloneness one realizes oneself, one comes to the center, one is thrown to the original source.\nThis is a very good meditation – you can do it. Take any object, but let the object remain the same every day so that the same image is created inside and you remove yourself from the same image. Images in the temples were used for this technique.Now images are there, but the technique is lost. You go to a temple – this is the technique to do. Look at the statue of Mahavir or Buddha or Ram or Krishna or any other. Look at the statue, concentrate on it; focus the whole mind so that the statue becomes an image inside. Then close your eyes. Remove your eyes from the statue, then close them. And then remove the image, wipe it out completely.\nThen you are there in your total aloneness, in your total purity, in your total innocence. Realizing that is freedom, realizing that is truth.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8176","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_1/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_1/>Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 Several more looking methods</h1><div class=post-meta>39 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8176 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Vigyan_Bhairav_Tantra_Vol_1/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR THOUGHT FROM IT. THEN.</p><p><br></p><p>We live on the surface of ourselves – just at the fringe, the
boundary. The senses are just on the boundary and your consciousness is
way deep down at the center. We live in the senses; that is natural. But
that is not the ultimate flowering, it is just the beginning. And when
we are living in the senses, we are basically concerned with objects,
because senses are irrelevant unless there is concern with some object
of enjoyment. For example, eyes are useless unless there is something to
be seen, ears are useless unless there is something to be heard, and
hands are useless unless there is something to be touched.</p><p>We live in the senses; therefore, we have to live in objects. The
senses are just on the boundary of the being, in the body, and objects
are not even on the boundary: they are beyond the boundary. So three
points have to be understood before we enter the techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the consciousness is at the center. Second, the senses through
which the consciousness moves out are at the boundary. And third, the
objects in the world to which the consciousness</p><p>moves, through the senses, are beyond the boundary. These three
things have to be remembered: consciousness at the center, senses at the
boundary and objects beyond the boundary. Try to understand it clearly,
because then the techniques will be very simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at it from many directions. One: senses are just in between,
just in the middle. At one side is consciousness, at another side is the
world of objects. Senses are just in the middle – between the two. From
the senses you can move either way: either you can go to the objects or
you can go to the center. Either way the distance is the same. From the
senses, doors open both ways – move to the objects or move to the
center.</p><p><br></p><p>You are at the senses. That is why one of the most famous Zen
Masters, Bokuju, has said that NIRVANA and the world are the same
distance away. So do not think that the nirvana is very far away. The
world and the nirvana, this world and that other world, are both at the
same distance.</p><p><br></p><p>This saying has created much confusion because we feel that nirvana
is very, very far away - that Moksha, liberation, the kingdom of God, is
very, very far away. We feel that the world is just near, just here. But
Bokuju says, and he says rightly, that both are at the same
distance.</p><p><br></p><p>The world is here, and nirvana is also here. The world is near, and
nirvana is also near, For nirvana you have to move inwards, for the
objects you have to move outwards; the distance is the same. From my
eyes, my center is just as near as you are near me. I can see you if I
move outward, I can see myself if I move inward. And we are at the doors
of the senses, but naturally, the bodily needs are such that
consciousness moves outwards. You need food, you need water to drink,
you need a house where to live. These are your bodily needs and these
can only be found in the world, so quite naturally, consciousness moves
through the senses toward the world. Unless you create a need which can
only be fulfilled when you move inward, you will never move inward.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if a child were born self-sufficient, if he didn’t need
any food, he would not look at his mother at all. The mother would
become irrelevant, meaningless, because for the child the mother is not
the meaning: food is the meaning. The mother is his first food, and
because the mother gives him food and satisfies a basic need, without
which he will die, he starts loving the mother. That love comes
secondly, as a shadow, because the mother is fulfilling a basic
need.</p><p><br></p><p>So those mothers who are feeding their children through bottles
should not expect much love because for the child food is the need, not
the mother. The mother will come into his being, enter into his being
only through food. That is why food and love are deeply related-very,
very deeply related. If your love need is fulfilled, you will need less
food. If your love need is not fulfilled, you will need more food. So
those who love and who are loved will not gather much fat. There are
other reasons also, but this is one of the most basic. They will not eat
much. If love is not fulfilled, then food becomes a substitute. Then
they will eat much.</p><p><br></p><p>For the child, food is the basic need. But if a child should be born
who can be self-sufficient, who does not need any food, who does not
need any outward help to be alive, he will not move in the world at all.
Do you think he will move? There would be no need. And unless a need is
there, the energy will never move. We move outwardly not because we are
sinners. We move outwardly because we have needs which can be fulfilled
only through objects-which can be gained if we move in the world of
objects.</p><p>Why do you not move inward? Because you have not yet created the need
to move inward. Once the need is there, it is as easy to move inward as
to move outward. What is that need? That need is concerned with
religion. You cannot be religious unless that need is there. How is that
need created? By what process does one become aware of a deep need which
helps you move inward?</p><p><br></p><p>Three things are to be remembered. Firstly, death. Remember, all
life-needs force you to move outward. If you want to move inward, death
must become a basic concern; otherwise you cannot move inward. That is
why it happened that persons like Buddha, who became deeply conscious of
death, started moving inward. Only when you become aware of death will
you create the need to look back.</p><p><br></p><p>Life looks outward. Unless you become aware of death, religion is
meaningless for you. That is why animals have no religion. They are
alive, they are as much alive as man, or even more, but they cannot be
conscious of death, they cannot conceive of death, they cannot see death
in the future. They see that others are dying, but it never occurs to
the animal mind that this death is an indication of his death also.</p><p><br></p><p>For the animal mind death always occurs to others. And if for you
also death is just something which happens to others, you still live in
the animal mind. If you are not aware of death, you have not yet become
man. That is the basic difference between animal and man-because animal
cannot be aware of death, only man can be. If you are not aware of death
you are not a man yet, and only man creates the need to move inward.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, man means awareness of death. I am not saying become afraid of
death; that is not awareness. Just be aware of the fact that death is
coming nearer and nearer and you have to be prepared for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has its own needs; death creates its own needs. That is why
younger societies are irreligious – because younger societies are not
yet aware of the phenomenon of death; it has not become a central
concern for them. An older society – for example, India, one of the
oldest societies in existence – is so much aware of death. Because of
that awareness, deep down India is religious. So the first thing: become
aware of death. Think about it, look at it, contemplate it. Do not be
afraid, do not escape the fact. It is there and you cannot escape it! It
has come into existence with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your death is born with you; now you cannot escape it. You have
hidden it in yourself – become aware of it. The moment you become aware
that you are going to die, that death is certain, your total mind will
start looking in a different dimension. Then food is a basic need for
the body, but not for the being, because even if you get food death will
occur. Food cannot protect you from death, food can only postpone. Food
can help you to postpone. If you get a good shelter, a good house, it
will not protect you from death. it will only help you to die
conveniently, comfortably. And death, whether it happens comfortably or
uncomfortably, is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>In life you may be poor or rich, but death is the great equalizer.
The greatest communism is in death. Howsoever you live, it makes no
difference; death happens equally. In life, equality is impossible; in
death, inequality is impossible. Become aware of it, contemplate it. And
it is not only that death is certain somewhere in the future: with the
idea that it is very far away, you will again not be able to contemplate
it. The mind has a very small range; the focus of the mind is very
small. You cannot</p><p>think beyond thirty years. After thirty years there will be death...
it is as if you are not going to die. Thirty years is so long, the
distance is so much, it is as if death is not going to occur.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to contemplate death, know another fact about it: it can
occur the next moment; it is possible the very next moment. You may not
be able to hear my whole sentence, I may not be able to complete it. My
mother’s father used to tell me that when I was born he consulted one
astrologer, one of the best known astrologers of those days. The
astrologer was to make my KUNDALI – birth chart. But the astrologer
studied it and he said, “If this child survives after seven years, only
then will I make the chart. It seems impossible that he can survive for
more than seven years, so it is useless. If the child is going to die in
seven years it is useless to make the kundali; it will be of no use. And
it has been my habit,” the astrologer said, “that unless I am certain
that the kundali will be useful I never make it.” So he didn’t make
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, I survived. Then my mother’s father
went to the astrologer, but he was dead, so he never could make my
kundali. He was dead, and I have been constantly wondering about this.
He was aware of the fact that this child may die, but he was not aware
of the fact that he may die. He was not aware! It seems that he was
absolutely unconcerned – and he was no ordinary man. But no one is
concerned with his own death. Knowingly, cunningly, we are not concerned
with it because it creates a fear. So I have always suspected that that
astrologer might have never looked at his own kundali; otherwise he
would have become aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is possible the very next moment, but the mind will not believe
it. I say it and your mind will say, “No! How is it possible the next
moment? It is far away.” But that is a trick. If you postpone, you
cannot contemplate. It must be so near that you can focus on it. And
when I say that the next moment it is possible, I mean it. It can
happen, and whenever it will happen it will be the next moment. Just
before it, you could not have conceived that it was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>A person is dying: just a moment before he could never have thought
that death is so near. It always happens in the next moment – remember.
It has always happened that way, and this will be the way always. It
always happens in the next moment. Bring it near so that you can focus
on it, and that very focusing will help you to enter in, a new need will
be created.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you go on living. You go on creating artificial meanings
and purposes for this very moment. You never think of your life as a
whole, whether it has any meaning or not. You go on creating new
meanings, and you push yourself on with those meanings. That is why a
poor man lives a more meaningful life than a rich man – because a poor
man has many things to get, and that gives a meaning to his life. If you
are really rich, it means you have everything that is possible and this
world cannot offer anything to you. Then your life becomes meaningless.
Now you cannot create any meaning for this moment, for this day, to help
you live. That is why the richer a society, the more affluent a culture,
the more meaninglessness is felt. Poorer societies never feel
meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>A poor man is concerned with having a house. For years together he
will work for it. His life has a meaning; something has to be achieved.
And when he gets the house he will be happy for a few days at least, but
then bigger houses are there... So he will go on moving, doing this and
that, never thinking about his life as a whole, whether it has any
meaning or not. He never takes life as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Just imagine that you have everything – the house, the car that you
long for, and all your dreams are fulfilled. So now what? Just imagine
that whatsoever you need is there, you have it. Now what?</p><p>Suddenly meaning disappears. You are standing on an abyss; nothing
can be done. You become meaningless. You are already meaningless, just
not aware. Even if you get the whole world, then what? What is
fulfilled?</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was coming to India, and he met a great saint, Diogenes.
Diogenes was one of the most penetrating minds ever born. He lived naked
like Mahavir; he is the Mahavir of Greek civilization and culture. He
left everything, renounced everything, not because through renouncing
things he was going to get anything – that is not real renouncing, not
authentic renunciation. If you renounce something to get something, that
is a bargain. If you think that you are going to have some reservation
in heaven and that is why you renounce, it is not renunciation. If you
renounce the bodily pleasures to have spiritual pleasures, this is not
renunciation.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes renounced everything, not because out of it he was going to
get something. He renounced just to see if when he has nothing, whether
there is any meaning or not. He thought that if one possesses nothing,
if even then one has a meaning, a purpose, a destiny, then death cannot
annihilate anything, because death can annihilate only a possessions and
the body is also possession. He left everything. He had only one thing:
a wooden bowl out of which to drink water. He thought, “This is not much
of a possession.” Then one day he saw a child drinking water with his
hands. He immediately threw away the bowl. He said, “If a child can
drink water with his hands, am I more weak than a child?”</p><p><br></p><p>When Alexander was coming to India to conquer, to make a world
empire, somebody informed him that just on the way, where he would be
stopping, there lived a great sage who was just the opposite of him. He
was told, “You are going to make a world empire, and he has even thrown
away his bowl because he says that as he is happy without it, why carry
this burden? And you say that unless the whole world becomes your
empire, you cannot be happy. So he is just at the opposite pole, and it
would be good if you meet him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was fascinated. It happens that the opposite always
fascinates. The opposite always fascinates; it has a deep sexual
attraction. Just a man is attracted to woman or woman is attracted to
man, there is the same attraction with the opposite. Alexander could not
by-pass Diogenes, but it was not good for him to go to Diogenes, and it
was impossible that Diogenes would come to him – there was no
solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes was informed. Many, many messengers came to inform him that
“The Great Alexander is passing this way. It would be good if you meet
him.” He said, “The Great Alexander? Who has said this to you! I think
he himself has. So tell your Great Alexander that he has nothing to give
to me, and there is no need for him to meet me – and I am a very small
man.” He used to say, “Really, I am a dog, not a man at all – just a
dog, so there is no need. It is below his dignity to meet this dog.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Alexander had to come. Diogenes is reported to have said, “I
hear you are going to win the whole world, so I thought, I closed my
eyes and thought, ‘Okay! If I have won the whole world, then what?’ This
has been my problem constantly: if I have won the whole world, then
what?” It is reported that Alexander, after hearing this, became very
sad. “Then what?” he said to Diogenes. “Do not talk such things. You
make me very sad.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “But you will become very sad when you win the whole
world. What can I do? I am</p><p>just imagining, and I have come to conclude that this is useless. You
are making a suicidal effort. You yourself are trying to win the whole
world – so then what? If you succeed, then what? ”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander returned from Diogenes very disturbed, upset, sad. He said
to his companions, “This man is very dangerous. He has shattered my
dreams.” And he could never forget, could never forgive Diogenes. The
day he died, he remembered him again, and he said, “It may be that that
fellow was right: then what ?”</p><p><br></p><p>So the next thing is to remember always that whatsoever you are
doing, whatsoever you are achieving, remember to ask, “If I succeed,
then what?” Is there any meaning in it all, or is there just some
artificial meaning given by you only to divide, to create an illusion
around you so that you feel you are doing something worthwhile – and all
the time you are really wasting life and energy, not doing anything
worthwhile! There is only one thing worthwhile: if you can become happy
without anything, without any dependence: if you can be blissful alone,
totally alone. If nothing is needed for your bliss, only then can you be
blissful; otherwise you will be in misery, always in misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Dependence is misery, and those who depend on possessions, those who
depend on accumulated knowledge, those who depend on this or that, they
are helping their own misery to become accumulated more and more. So the
next point to remember is to ask whether you have any meaning, or
whether you are just floating along without any meaning. Are you just
making believe that this or that is the meaning of your existence?</p><p><br></p><p>One man used to come to me. He used to say that if his son gets into
college, that would be all and he would be very happy. He was a poor
man, a very ordinary clerk, and that was the only dream, that his son
would get into college. Then the son got into college. Now the son has
become a forest official. A few months back the son was here and he told
me, “I am getting only six hundred rupees per month. I have two children
and this is my only dream, that they can get a good education; that is
all. I am working hard. If they can be well educated and if I can send
one of my children to some foreign country to study, that is all I
ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>His father is no more; he has died. This was his meaning in life, his
purpose – to make his boy educated and well placed. Now the boy is well
placed, and now the boy has the same purpose, to help his children
become educated and well placed. And he will die, and those children
will go on doing the same nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the meaning of all this? What are you doing? Just passing
time? Just destroying life? Or have you got some authentic meaning which
you can say makes you happy, blissful? This is the second consideration
which will turn you inward.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, man goes on forgetting. You go on forgetting things. You
were angry yesterday, and you repented it. Now you have forgotten, and
if the same stimulus is given again, you will be angry again. This has
been so for your whole life: you go on repeating the same things.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that it is very extraordinary to find a man who learns
through life – very rare. Really, no one learns. If you learn, then you
cannot commit the same mistake twice. But you go on committing the same
thing again and again. Rather, the more you commit, the more you become
prone to commit it. You are angry again and again, and again and again
you repent it, and you have not learned</p><p>anything. Given the stimulus, you will be angry, and you will do the
same madness, and then you will repent again – that is also part of it.
And then you will again be ready to be stimulated and to be angry.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing: if you want to turn in, learn! Whatsoever you are
doing, learn through it. Take the essential out of it. Look back at what
have you been doing with your life and your energy and your time. The
same mistakes, the same foolishnesses, the same stupidities, again and
again.</p><p><br></p><p>So you move in a wheel. However, it is not good to say that you move
the wheel: rather, the wheel moves you. Mechanically, you go on and on
and on. That is why in India we have called the world SANSAR. SANSAR
means the wheel which goes on, and you are just clinging to some spoke
on it and you go on moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you learn something about this wheel, this vicious circle,
this sansar, unless you learn something about it, you will not leave the
spoke and jump out of it. So three words, three key words:</p><p><br></p><p>Death: make it a constant contemplation. Meaning: go on searching for
it in your life.</p><p>And learn: learn through your life, because there is no other
learning. Scriptures won’t give you anything.</p><p><br></p><p>If your own life cannot give you something, nothing can give it to
you. Learn through your own life, conclude through it. What have you
been doing with yourself? If you are in a wheel, jump out of it. But to
know that you are in a wheel, you will have to go deep into
understanding and learning. These three things will help you to turn
in.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the techniques:</p><p><br></p><p>SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why I have said so many things – because the techniques are
very easy, and you can do them and nothing will result. Then you will
say, “What type of techniques are these? We can do them, they are so
simple. SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE SKY, THE BLUE SKY, BEYOND THE</p><p>CLOUDS, THE SERENITY: one will become silent and serene,
fulfilled.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can look at the blue sky beyond the clouds and nothing will
happen. Then you will say, “What type of technique is this? Shiva is not
talking rationally, reasonably. He is saying anything, whatsoever comes
to his mind. What kind of technique is this – SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE
BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY. One will become serene!”</p><p><br></p><p>But if you remember: death, meaning, learning, this technique will
help you immediately to turn in. LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND
CLOUDS... Just looking, not thinking. The sky is infinite; it ends
nowhere. Just look into it. There is no object; that is why the sky is
chosen. The sky is not an object. Linguistically it is; existentially,
the sky is not an object because an object begins and ends.</p><p>You can go around an object; you cannot go around the sky. You are in
the sky, but you cannot go around it. So you may be the object for the
sky, but the sky cannot be your object. You can look into it, but you
cannot look at it, and that looking into it goes on and on... it never
ends.</p><p><br></p><p>So look into the blue sky and go on looking. The object is infinite,
there is no boundary to it. Do not think about it; do not say it is
beautiful. Do not say, “How lovely!” Do not appreciate the color; do not
start thinking. If you start thinking, you have stopped. Now your eyes
are not moving into the blue, the infinite blue. Just move, just look –
do not think. Do not create words; they will become barriers. Not even
“blue sky” should be said. Do not verbalize.</p><p><br></p><p>There should be just a pure, innocent look into the blue sky. It
never ends. You will go on and on and on and on, and suddenly, because
there is no object, just a vacuum, suddenly you will become aware of
yourself. Why? Because if there is any vacuum your senses become
useless. Senses are only useful if there is an object.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are looking at a flower, then you are looking at something –
the flower is there. The sky is not there. What do we mean by a sky?
That which is not there. Sky means the space. All objects are in the
sky, but the sky is not an object. It is just the vacuum, the space in
which objects can exist. The sky itself is just pure emptiness. Look at
this pure emptiness. That is why the sutra says: BEYOND THE CLOUDS.
Because clouds are not the sky, they are objects floating in the sky.
You can look at the clouds, but that will not help. Look into the blue
sky – not at the stars, not at the moon, not at the clouds, but at
objectlessness, emptiness. Look into it.</p><p><br></p><p>What will happen? In emptiness, there is no object to be grasped by
the senses. Because there is no object to be grasped, clung to, senses
become futile. And if you are looking into the blue sky without
thinking, without thinking, suddenly you will feel that everything has
disappeared; there is nothing. In that disappearance you will become
aware of yourself. Looking into this emptiness, you will become empty.
Why? Because your eyes are like a mirror. Whatsoever is before them is
reflected. I see you and you are sad – then a sudden sadness enters into
me. If a sad person enters into your room, you become sad. What has
happened? You have looked at sadness. You are like a mirror: the sadness
is reflected in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone laughs heartily – suddenly you feel a laughter coming to you
also. It has become infectious. What has happened? You are like a
mirror, you are reflecting things. You look at a beautiful object – it
is reflected in you. You look at an ugly object – it is reflected in
you. Whatsoever you are seeing penetrates deep into you. It becomes part
of your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are looking into the emptiness, there is nothing to be
reflected - or only the blue infinite sky. If it is reflected, if you
feel the blue infinite sky within, you will become serene, you will find
serenity. That is there. And if really you can conceive of emptiness -
where sky, blue, everything disappears: just at emptiness - inside also
emptiness will be reflected. And in emptiness, how can you be worried,
how can you be tense?</p><p><br></p><p>In emptiness, how can the mind function? It stops; it disappears. In
the disappearance of the mind - the mind that is tense, worried, filled
with thoughts that are relevant, irrelevant - in that disappearance of
the mind, THE SERENITY.</p><p>One thing more. Emptiness, if reflected in, becomes desirelessness.
Desire is tension. You desire and you become worried. You look at a
beautiful woman – a sudden desire arises. You look at a beautiful house
– you want to possess it. You look at a beautiful car just passing by
your side – you want to be in it, you want to drive it. A desire has
come in, and with the desire mind becomes worried: “How to get it? What
to do to get it?” The mind becomes frustrated or hopeless or hopeful,
but it is all dreaming. Many things can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>When desire is there, you are disturbed. The mind is shattered into
fragments, and many plans, dreams, projections start; you become mad.
Desire is the seed of madness.</p><p><br></p><p>But emptiness is not an object; it is just emptiness. When you look
at emptiness, no desire arises; it cannot arise. You do not want to
possess emptiness, you do not want to love emptiness, you do not want to
make a house out of it. Emptiness? You cannot do anything with it! All
movement of the mind stops, no desire arises, and with the non-arising
of desire, THE SERENITY. You become silent, serene. A sudden peace
explodes in you. You have become like the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing. Whatsoever you contemplate, you become like it, you
become that, because mind can take infinite forms. Whatsoever you
desire, your mind takes its form, you become it. That is why a person
who is just after riches, gold, after money, his mind becomes just a
treasure - nothing else. Shake him, and you will feel the rupees inside
- the sound of rupees, nothing else. Whatsoever you desire, you become
that. So be conscious of what you are desiring because you are becoming
that.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky is the most empty thing. It is just near you and it costs
nothing, and you do not have to go somewhere – to the Himalayas or to
Tibet – to find the sky. They have destroyed everything, technology has
destroyed everything, but the sky is still there; you can use it. Use it
before they destroy it – any day they will destroy it. Look, penetrate
into it. And the look must be a non-thinking one, remember this. Then
you will feel the same sky within, the same dimension within, the same
space and blueness and emptiness. That is why Shiva says, SIMPLY.</p><p><br></p><p>SIMPLY BY LOOKING INTO THE BLUE SKY BEYOND CLOUDS, THE SERENITY.</p><p><br></p><p>The next technique:</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. EYES STILL,
WITHOUT WINKING, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.”</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. This is a
secret method. In</p><p>this esoteric tantra, the master gives you the teaching secretly, the
doctrine secretly – or the mantra secretly. When the disciple is ready,
then the mantra, or the supreme secret, will be imparted, communicated
to him, privately. Just in his ear it will be whispered. This technique
is concerned with that whispering. LISTEN WHILE THE ULTIMATE MYSTICAL
TEACHING IS IMPARTED.</p><p><br></p><p>When the master has decided that now you are ready and the secret of
his own experience can be communicated, when the moment has come when he
can say to you that which is unsayable, then this technique has to be
used. EYES STILL, WITHOUT WINKING, AT ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE. When
master, is imparting his secret to you in your ear, whispering it, let
your eyes be totally still: no movement of the eyes. That means the mind
should be quiet, thoughtless.</p><p>No winking – not even a slight movement, because that will show a
disturbance within. Just become an empty ear with no movement within.
The consciousness is just waiting to be impregnated, just open,
receptive, passive... no activity on its own part. And when this will
happen, this moment when you are totally empty, not thinking anything
but just waiting... not waiting for something, because then it will
become thinking, not waiting for something but just waiting; when this
static moment, this non-dynamic moment will happen; when everything has
stopped, time is not flowing and mind is totally vacant – it becomes
no-mind. Only into a no-mind can a master impart.</p><p><br></p><p>And he is not going to give a very long discourse: he will give just
one or two or three words. In that silence those one, two or three words
will penetrate to your very core, to the very center, and they will
become a seed there. In this passive awareness, in this silence, AT ONCE
BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.</p><p><br></p><p>One can become free only by becoming free of the mind; there is no
other freedom. Freedom from the mind is the only freedom. Mind is the
bondage, the slavery, the servitude. So a disciple has to wait with his
master for the right moment when he will call him and impart. He is not
to ask, because asking means desire. He is not to expect, because
expectation means conditions, desire, mind. He is just to wait. And when
he will be ready, when his waiting will become total, the master can do
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes the master can do very trivial things, and the thing will
happen. And ordinarily, even if a Shiva goes on talking about one
hundred and twelve methods, nothing will happen because the preparation
is not there. You can throw seeds on stones, but nothing will happen.
The fault is not of the seeds. You can throw a seed out of season, but
nothing will happen. The fault is not of the seed. The right season is
needed, the right moment is needed, the right soil is needed. Only then
will the seed become alive and transform.</p><p><br></p><p>So sometimes very trivial things work. For example, Lin Chi became
enlightened while he was just sitting on his master’s verandah - on the
verandah of his master, and the Master came out and just laughed. He
looked at Lin Chi - into his eyes - and laughed uproariously. Lin Chi
started laughing, bowed down, and left. But he had been waiting there
for six years: that verandah was his abode for six years.</p><p><br></p><p>The master would come day after day, month after month, and he would
not even look at him. And Lin Chi was waiting there. Then after two
years, for the first time he looked at him. Then two more years passed,
and for the first time he patted him. Then Lin Chi waited and waited,
and after six years, one day suddenly he came out, stared into Lin Chi’s
eyes, and Lin Chi must have done this technique: LISTEN WHILE THE
ULTIMATE MYSTICAL TEACHING IS IMPARTED. EYES STILL, WITHOUT WINKING, AT
ONCE BECOME ABSOLUTELY FREE.</p><p><br></p><p>The master looked and used laughter as a medium. He was a great
master. Really, words were not needed, just laughter. Suddenly there was
that laughter, and something happened in Lin Chi. He bowed down,
laughed, left, and told everyone that now he was no more, that he was
liberated, free. He was no more: that is what liberation means. You are
not liberated. You are liberated from yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Lin Chi used to tell how it happened. For six years he was waiting.
It was a long waiting, a patient waiting. He was just waiting on the
verandah, and every day the master would come. And he would</p><p>wait for the right moment – when he would become ready, then the
master would do something. Just by waiting for six years, you will fall
into meditation. What can you do? He might have thought for a few days
about old things, but if you do not give new food every day to the mind,
by and by it stops. How long can you chew again and again on the same
thing?</p><p><br></p><p>He might have been thinking about past things, and by and by, because
no new stimulus was given, thinking stopped. He was not allowed to read,
he was not allowed to talk, he was not allowed to move and meet anyone.
He was just allowed to fulfill the basic bodily needs and wait on the
verandah.</p><p><br></p><p>Silently he waited, day after day – day in, day out, day and night.
Summer would come and pass away, and winter would come and pass away,
and there would be rain and it would pass away: he must have forgotten
time. He must have forgotten for how many days he had been there. And
then one day suddenly the master appeared, and he looked deeply into his
eyes. Lin Chi’s eyes must have suddenly become static, non-dynamic. This
was the moment; six years were wasted for this. There was no movement of
the eyes, because a single movement and he may miss. Everything must
have become silent – and then suddenly, the uproarious laughter: the
master began laughing madly. That laughter must have been heard deep
down at the very core; it must have reached.</p><p><br></p><p>So when Lin Chi was asked, “What happened to you?” he said, “When my
master laughed, suddenly I recognized that the whole world is just a
joke. In his laughter, this was the message: The whole world is just a
joke, just a drama. An seriousness disappeared. And if the whole world
is just a joke, who is in bondage? And who needs to be free?” So Lin Chi
said, “There was no bondage at all. I was thinking that I was bound, and
that is why I was trying to be free, and then suddenly the master
laughed and the bondage fell away.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it has happened with such things; you can never conceive of
how it was possible. There are many Zen stories... One Zen master became
aware when the gong was beaten. Just while he was hearing the gong being
beaten, the sound, something shattered in him. One Zen nun became aware,
enlightened, while she was carrying two pails of water. Suddenly the
bamboo broke, and the earthen pots fell down. The sound, the breaking of
the pots and the water flowing out of them, and she became
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened? You can break many pots, but nothing will happen. A
right moment had come. She was coming back. Her master had said, “This
night I am going to give you the secret, so go and take a bath, and
bring two pails of water for me. I will take a bath and impart to you
the secret for which you have been waiting.” She must have felt ecstatic
– the moment had come. She took a bath, filled the pots, and carried
them back.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a full-moon night, and just when she was passing on the
footpath from the river to the ashram, suddenly the bamboo broke. When
she reached, the master was waiting, and he looked at her and he said,
“Now there is no need, it has happened. Now I have nothing to convey.
You have already received.”</p><p><br></p><p>That old nun used to say, “With that bamboo breaking, something broke
in me – something broke in me also. Those pails falling down, those
broken earthen pots, and I saw my body broken. I looked at the moon.
Everything was silent, serene, and I became silent and serene. From that
moment, I have not been, I am no more.” This is what liberation, freedom
means.</p><p>The next technique:</p><p><br></p><p>AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS DEPTHS UNTIL – THE
WONDROUSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>The techniques are similar, with a slight difference. AT THE EDGE OF
A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS DEPTHS UNTIL – THE WONDROUSNESS. Look
into a deep well. The well will be reflected in you. Forget thinking
completely; stop thinking completely. Just go on looking into the depth.
Now they say mind has its own depth, like a well. Now in the West, they
are developing depth psychology. They say mind is not just a surface. It
is just a beginning; there are depths – many depths, hidden depths.</p><p><br></p><p>Look into a well without thinking. The depth will be reflected in
you, the well will become just an outer symbol of the inner depth. And
go on looking UNTIL - THE WONDROUSNESS, until you feel
wonder-filled.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not stop before this moment. Go on looking, go on looking, go on
looking, day after day, month after month. Just go to a well, look deep,
with no thoughts moving in the mind. Just meditate. Just meditate on the
depth: meditate the depth, become one with it. Go on meditating; one day
your thoughts will not be there. Any moment it can happen. Suddenly you
will feel you have the same well within you, the same depth. And then a
strange, very strange feeling will come to you: you will feel
wonder-filled.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu was passing over a bridge with his master, Lao Tsu. Lao
Tsu is reported to have said to Chuang Tzu, “Remain here. Go on looking
down from this bridge to the river until the river stops and the bridge
starts flowing. Then come to me.” The river is flowing; the bridge never
flows. But Chuang Tzu was given this meditation - to wait on this
bridge. It is said he made a hut on the bridge and remained there.
Months passed... he would just sit on the bridge, looking down for the
moment when the river would stop and the bridge would flow. Then he
would go to the master.</p><p><br></p><p>One day it happened: the river stopped and the bridge started
flowing. How can it happen? If thought stops completely, then anything
is possible, because really, it is fixedness of thought which says that
the river is flowing and the bridge is static. This is just relative -
just relative!</p><p><br></p><p>Einstein says, and physics says, that everything is relative. You are
traveling in a train, a fast train. What happens? The trees flow by,
they run by. And if the train is really smooth and you do not feel that
the train is running, you are just looking through the windows, the
trees are moving, not the train.</p><p><br></p><p>Einstein has said that if in space two trains are running, or two
spaceships are running side by side with the same speed, you will not be
able to feel that they are moving. You can feel a moving train because
you see the static things by the side. If there is nothing - for
example, if the trees are also moving in the same direction with the
same speed - you will feel static. Or when a train passes in the
opposite direction, your speed is doubled. You feel your train has
become faster.</p><p><br></p><p>It has not become faster. It is the same train with the same speed,
but a train going in the opposite direction gives you the feeling of
double speed. If speed is relative, then it is just a fixedness of the
mind to think that the river is flowing and the bridge is static.</p><p>Continuously meditating, meditating, meditating, Chuang Tzu came to
realize that everything is relative. The river is flowing because you
take the bridge as static. The bridge is also flowing deep down. Nothing
is static in this world. Atoms are moving, electrons are moving; the
bridge is a constant movement within. Everything is flowing; the bridge
is also flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu must have had a glimpse of the atomic structure of the
bridge. Now they say this wall which looks static is not static.
Movement is there, every electron is running, but the movement is so
fast you cannot see it. That is why you feel it as static.</p><p><br></p><p>If this fan goes on with a faster movement, faster and faster, you
will not be able to see its wings, the spaces between them. You will not
be able to see this. And if it moves with the speed of light, you will
see simply one circular disc that is static. Nothing will be moving in
it because eyes cannot catch that fast movement.</p><p><br></p><p>So Chuang Tzu must have had a glimpse of the atomic structure of the
bridge. He waited and waited, and the fixed mind dissolved. Then he saw
that the bridge was flowing - and the movement was so fast that the
river was just static in comparison to it. He came running to Lao Tsu
and Lao Tsu said, “Okay! Now do not ask me. The thing has happened to
you.” What had happened? No-mind had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>In this technique, AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP WELL LOOK STEADILY INTO ITS
DEPTH UNTIL</p><p>- THE WONDROUSNESS. When you feel wonder-filled, when the mystery
descends upon you, when mind is no more but simply mystery - a milieu of
mystery – then you will be capable of knowing yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Another technique:</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK UPON SOME OBJECT, THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM IT, THEN
SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR THOUGHT FROM IT. THEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Look upon some object. Look at a flower, but remember what that LOOK
means. Look! Do not think. I need not repeat it. Always remember that
look means: look, do not think. If you think, it is not a look; then you
have contaminated everything. It must be a pure look, a simple look.</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK UPON SOME OBJECT. Look at a flower,- a roseflower. THEN SLOWLY
WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM IT - very slowly. The flower is there – first
look at it. Drop thinking; go on looking. When you feel that now there
is no thought, simply the flower is there in your mind, nothing else,
now slightly move your eyes away. By and by the flower recedes, goes out
of focus, but the image will remain with you. The object will have gone
out of focus; you will have turned your look away. The image, the outer
flower is no more there, but it is reflected - reflected in your mirror
of consciousness. It will be there! THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR SIGHT FROM
IT, THEN SLOWLY WITHDRAW YOUR THOUGHT FROM IT.</p><p><br></p><p>So first, withdraw from the outer object. Then only the inner image
remains - the thought of the roseflower. Now withdraw that thought also.
This is very difficult, the second part, but if the first part is done
exactly as it is said, it will not be so difficult. First withdraw your
mind from the object, your sight. Then close your eyes, and just as you
have removed your eyesight from the object, remove</p><p>yourself from the image. Withdraw yourself; become indifferent. Do
not look at it inside, just feel that you have gone away from it. Soon
the image will also disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>First the object disappears, then the image disappears. And when the
image disappears, Shiva says, THEN. Then you are left alone. In that
aloneness one realizes oneself, one comes to the center, one is thrown
to the original source.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very good meditation – you can do it. Take any object, but
let the object remain the same every day so that the same image is
created inside and you remove yourself from the same image. Images in
the temples were used for this technique.Now images are there, but the
technique is lost. You go to a temple – this is the technique to do.
Look at the statue of Mahavir or Buddha or Ram or Krishna or any other.
Look at the statue, concentrate on it; focus the whole mind so that the
statue becomes an image inside. Then close your eyes. Remove your eyes
from the statue, then close them. And then remove the image, wipe it out
completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are there in your total aloneness, in your total purity, in
your total innocence. Realizing that is freedom, realizing that is
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

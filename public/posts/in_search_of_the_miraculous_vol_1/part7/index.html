Know that as the sun has risen and flooded the earth with light, so your own light will flood you inside. As flowers have bloomed this morning, so will the flowers of bliss bloom within you. One who begins his pilgrimage with full hope reaches his goal, and one who calls with all his thirst attains to God.\nThose who can should meditate in a standing position. Friends sitting near those who stand up will do well to move away from them so they are not hurt by someone falling on them. The momentum of action is great when it is done standing; the whole body will begin to dance in ecstasy. Therefore friends sitting close to them should move away, leaving them enough space.\nAnd gather your courage and bring all your energy into today’s meditation. Spare nothing. THE FIRST STAGE\nClose your eyes and begin deep breathing. Inhale deeply and exhale deeply, and watch within that a breath came in and another breath went out. Draw a deep breath in and expel a deep breath out... Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply. Bring all your energy into it. For ten minutes breathe hard – in and out. Breathe deeply – in and out. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply. And exert yourself absolutely.\nBreathe deeply, breathe more deeply, breathe still more deeply. And keep watching within; remain a witness to each breath coming in and going out. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply,\nand keep observing, keep witnessing. See a breath is com ing in and another going out. And invest all your strength in deep breathing. Breathe deeply, breathe more deeply and breathe still more deeply.\nFor ten minutes bring all your might into play. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply. And keep watching within that a deep breath comes in and another deep breath goes out. And expend all your strength in breathing. Don’t save even an iota of it. Exert yourself to the maximum. Deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing. Let the body turn into a mass of energy. Let there be nothing but breathing. Let the body turn into electricity. Breathe deeply, more deeply, still more deeply... Deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing. No one should lag behind; so use up all your energy in breath ing. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply...\nNow only five minutes are left, so exert your maximum. We shall then enter the second stage. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply. Let the body become a machine, a breathing machine. Let there be nothing but breathing. So breathe deeply, breathe more deeply, breathe still more deeply. Bring into play your entire strength, spare nothing... only breathing remains, only breathing. Don’t shirk, don’t withhold, don’t slacken efforts; spare nothing, set in motion your entire power. Bring all your energy into play. Put all your strength into breathing. Bring all your might to deep breathing.\nDon’t shirk, don’t slacken efforts, don’t lag behind. Let the whole atmosphere be charged. Do your very best and it will happen. Invest all your energy and you will make it... Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply. And exert your maximum.. . See that you don’t slacken the momentum. I am now very close to you and asking you to do your very best so that you don’t have to say later that you could not make it. So bring all your energy into breathing fast and deep. Bring all your energy. Bring all your energy. And breathe deeply, breathe more deeply, breathe still more deeply, breathe fast and deep. The deeper you breathe the easier it will be to awaken the energy. Then the kundalini begins to rise up. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply. Kundalini will rise up, only you breathe fast and deep. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply... Energy will ascend, you just breathe fast and deep. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply.\nNow only two minutes are to go, so go at it with your total strength. Deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing. Breathe as deeply as you can. Only two minutes are left, so exert your maximum. Then we will go over to the second stage. Deep breathing, deep breathing... deep breathing... If something is rising within, let it rise... Now the last minute, bring your entire might into it. We then pass to the second stage... Breathe fast and deep... and do it with all your vigor. Breathe with all your strength. Energy is rising within, so don’t spare your self. Bring all your energy into play. Breathe deeply, more deeply, still more deeply. Put all your energy into breathing. Hammer your inside with fast and deep breathing, and energy will begin to wake up. Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath and deep breath. Now we are going to enter the second stage. So breathe deeply, breathe more deeply and breathe still more deeply. I am telling each one of you directly to invest your total energy into breathing. Deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing.\nNow on to the second stage.\nTHE SECOND STAGE\nContinue to breathe deeply, and let go of the body. Whatever happens to the body, let it happen. If it cries, let it cry. If it laughs, allow it. If it dances, leave it free to dance. Allow everything that happens to the body. Let go of it. Don’t resist. Don’t interfere. Leave the body alone... Leave the body alone. Allow everything that happens to the body. Let go of it completely. Allow whatever happens to the bodily limbs; let go of them. Let go of the body. Whatever happens to the body for these ten minutes, let it hap pen unimpeded..aet go of the body. Let go of the body utterly. It will dance. It will jump. Allow every thing that happens to it on its own. If the energy within will rise, the body will express it through dancing, jumping... allow it to do so. Let go of the body absolutely. Let go is the key word.\nLet go of the body, and continue to breathe deeply. When inner energy will rise, the body will dance, jump and tremble; allow everything that hap-pens to it. The body will roll on the ground, it will yell and scream; don’t resist. Let go. Let go of the body completely so that you see it separate from you. Let go of the body; let go of the body absolutely. Leave the body to itself. Let go of it utterly. Let it be just an instrument of electricity. It is dancing. It is jumping. It is trembling... Let go of it. The body is crying. The body is laughing. Leave it alone to do what it likes. You are separate from the body; let go of the body. Let what happens to it; don’t resist. Some friends are resisting, don’t do so. Let go. Don’t resist in the least. Let it happen what happens to it... The body has to be wholly tired out. Cooperate with the body. Allow everything that happens to it... The body has to tire itself completely..aet go. Let go totally. Let what happens..aet go. Let go. Don’t resist. See that you don’t resist. Don’t resist at all. Let go. Let go utterly.\nNow five minutes remain, so let go of the body wholly. Cooperate with it in whatever happens to it. Whatever the body does, you cooperate with it. Let it laugh if it chooses to. Let it cry if it wants to. Let it dance if it begins to dance. Don’t obstruct, don’t resist. If it hops let it. Let go. Let go entirely.\n(Microphone stops working for a while as the operator left his job and joined the meditation, and Osho had to lead meditation without the help of mike.)\nLet go of the body utterly. And allow fully whatever happens to it. Let go with y our whole might. Let go. Now only two minutes are left to go. So let go of the body absolutely... The body is separate from you and you are separate from the body. Allow everything that happens to the body... you are separate from the body. For two minutes leave the body to itself absolutely. Then we go over to the third stage. Let go, let go, let go of the body in every way... Breathe deeply and let go of the body. Let the body be tired out..aet go. Let go. Let go. Breathe deeply and let go of the body... If the body dances let it. Let go of it completely... Bring your entire might to it before we enter the third stage. Let go of the body; let go. Now only a minute remains, so let go of the body utterly. And allow everything that happens to it. For one minute let go absolutely. Let go. Let go. Let the body shout, cry and laugh. Let go completely..aet the body do what it wants to do... You will see clearly that you are separate and the body is separate. Let go of the body absolutely, and then we go over to the third stage..aet go. Let go... Cooperate with it. Let go of the body and enter the third stage.\nTHE THIRD STAGE\nAsk from within: “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” For full ten minutes let the body dance and whirl, let deep breath ing continue and continue asking inside, “Who\nam I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Exert yourself fully and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking with full strength, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking with full strength, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”\nAsk: “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Ask with your entire might, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Bring your entire energy to it and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Put into action your whole energy and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”\nNow five minutes are in hand, so give of yourself wholly to the question, and then we will relax and rest..aet go of the body and continue asking from within, “Who am I? Who am I?” Exercise your entire might, use your complete strength and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Bring your whole energy to it and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Exert yourself absolutely and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Apply yourself to the maximum and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?”\nNow only three minutes remain and then we will rest, so ask with all your vigor, “Who am I? Who am I?” Tire yourself out. Energy is rising within... “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Now only two minutes, so ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Last two minutes, and then we will rest, so put into action your whole strength and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Energy is awakening inside, so let the body dance with abandon. Let go and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Let the energy within awaken fully and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go utterly mad, and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”... Tire yourself out, after which you will relax and rest...”Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”\nNow the last minute, “Who am I?” Let the body dance with abandon, if it wants to...”Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Before we enter into relaxation, bring your maximum energy into it. Exert yourself to the maximum in this last minute, and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Don’t miss the opportunity; exert yourself to the very maximum...”Who am l? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Put in your last drop of energy, and then we enter relaxation, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”\nTHE FOURTH STAGE\nThat’s all, no more. Drop everything. Drop asking, drop deep breathing, stop all activity and keep lying wherever you are. Those who are standing should keep standing. But if someone wants to sit or lie down, he can... Let everything be still and quiet, quiet and empty... Neither ask nor do anything. Just keep lying as if you are dead, as if you are not... The storm has passed, leaving behind inner peace... Everything has been erased... Everything is silent. The storm is gone... so lie and relax, relax for these ten minutes. It is in this silence, in this emptiness that he comes whom we have been seeking... Just keep lying relaxed and quiet... No more deep breathing, no more asking “Who am I?” Doing nothing. Give up everything. If you are standing keep standing. If you have fallen on the ground, remain so. Keep lying if you are already in that position. Be dead for these ten minutes, as if you are no more... The storm is over and there is peace all around. There is silence all over...\nIt is in this emptiness, in this void that something will happen, some flower will bloom, some stream of peace will sprout forth, music of bliss will be heard. It is in this very void that God comes. Await him, await, await him... Keep lying, keep lying. Await, await, just await. Everything is exhausted. Everything is empty... Await, await. I am now going to be silent for ten minutes. And for these ten minutes you lie quiet.\nAs if you are dead, as if you have disappeared. Only emptiness remains. Everything is quiet. Every thing is peaceful. Everything is silent. It is in this silence that God comes... This emptiness is the gate through which he enters us. Await, just await... As if you are dead. As if you have disappeared. The storm is gone leaving behind only peace and tranquility. Await, await, just awaiting...\nIt is in this very moment that something hap pens. Await silently. Await silently. Everything is empty, void. Await. Await. Await... As if you are no more; but someone within is awake. Everything is empty, void; but inside a light is shining that sees, knows and understands. You are effaced, but some entity within is awake... It is all light inside. Streams of bliss flow within. God is very near. Await. Await... As if you are dead. As if you are no more. As if you have disappeared. As if you are wiped out. Lose yourself the way a drop loses itself in the ocean... Await quietly...\nIt is in this losing that one wins, one attains. Just await. A quiet and silent light shines within. Inside you a deep bliss shines forth. Within you a river of bliss is going to flow. Just await. Await... Bliss will flow within. Light will descend within. Awaiting, awaiting and awaiting. As if you are no more. As if you are dead. As if you have disappeared. Everything has turned void.\nAnd it is in this void that you have God’s darshan, his vision. It is in this void that you get his glimpse. And it is in this void that you attain to him. Await. Await. Await... See within, someone is arriving. See within, someone is awakened. See with in, some bliss has become manifest – a bliss that you have never known, that is utterly unfamiliar and un known. See, every fiber of your being is filled with something unearthly. Await. Await...\nNow bliss and bliss alone remains. Now light and light alone remains. Peace and peace alone re mains. Await. Just await. In such silent moments he comes. In such silent moments you meet him. Await. Await. Await... He whom you are seeking is very close by. He whom you are searching for is near at hand. Await. Just await. Await silently.\nNow slowly come back from the world of bliss. Now slowly, slowly come back from the world of light. Very gently leave the inner world. And open your eyes very slowly and gently. If your eyes don’t open then cover them with your palms and then open them gently. No one should hurry though. Those who have fallen down and find it difficult to rise should first breathe deeply and then rise very slowly. Rise up very silently. Without speaking, without any noise. And those standing should sit down very silently, and open their eyes gently. Come back from the world of meditation.\nThe morning session is over.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3031","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/in_search_of_the_miraculous_vol_1/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/in_search_of_the_miraculous_vol_1/>In Search of the Miraculous Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Osho Leads Dynamic</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3031 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/In_Search_of_the_Miraculous_Vol_1/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

hope and will, and know that you are going to make it. Know that as the
sun has risen and flooded the earth with light, so your own light will
flood you inside. As flowers have bloomed this morning, so will the
flowers of bliss bloom within you. One who begins his pilgrimage with
full hope reaches his goal, and one who calls with all his thirst
attains to God.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who can should meditate in a standing position. Friends sitting
near those who stand up will do well to move away from them so they are

. See that you don’t slacken the momentum. I am now very close to you
and asking you to do your very best so that you don’t have to say later
that you could not make it. So bring all your energy into breathing fast
and deep. Bring all your energy. Bring all your energy. And breathe
deeply, breathe more deeply, breathe still more deeply, breathe fast and
deep. The deeper you breathe the easier it will be to awaken the energy.
Then the kundalini begins to rise up. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply,
breathe deeply, breathe deeply. Kundalini will rise up, only you breathe
fast and deep. Breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe
deeply... Energy will ascend, you just breathe fast and deep. Breathe
deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>Now only two minutes are to go, so go at it with your total strength.
Deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing. Breathe
as deeply as you can. Only two minutes are left, so exert your maximum.
Then we will go over to the second stage. Deep breathing, deep
breathing... deep breathing... If something is rising within, let it
rise... Now the last minute, bring your entire might into it. We then
pass to the second stage... Breathe fast and deep... and do it with all
your vigor. Breathe with all your strength. Energy is rising within, so
don’t spare your self. Bring all your energy into play. Breathe deeply,
more deeply, still more deeply. Put all your energy into breathing.
Hammer your inside with fast and deep breathing, and energy will begin
to wake up. Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath and deep
breath. Now we are going to enter the second stage. So breathe deeply,
breathe more deeply and breathe still more deeply. I am telling each one
of you directly to invest your total energy into breathing. Deep
breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep breathing, deep
breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>Now on to the second stage.</p><p>THE SECOND STAGE</p><p><br></p><p>Continue to breathe deeply, and let go of the body. Whatever happens
to the body, let it happen. If it cries, let it cry. If it laughs, allow
it. If it dances, leave it free to dance. Allow everything that happens
to the body. Let go of it. Don’t resist. Don’t interfere. Leave the body
alone... Leave the body alone. Allow everything that happens to the
body. Let go of it completely. Allow whatever happens to the bodily
limbs; let go of them. Let go of the body. Whatever happens to the body
for these ten minutes, let it hap pen unimpeded..aet go of the body. Let
go of the body utterly. It will dance. It will jump. Allow every thing
that happens to it on its own. If the energy within will rise, the body
will express it through dancing, jumping... allow it to do so. Let go of
the body absolutely. Let go is the key word.</p><p><br></p><p>Let go of the body, and continue to breathe deeply. When inner energy
will rise, the body will dance, jump and tremble; allow everything that
hap-pens to it. The body will roll on the ground, it will yell and
scream; don’t resist. Let go. Let go of the body completely so that you
see it separate from you. Let go of the body; let go of the body
absolutely. Leave the body to itself. Let go of it utterly. Let it be
just an instrument of electricity. It is dancing. It is jumping. It is
trembling... Let go of it. The body is crying. The body is laughing.
Leave it alone to do what it likes. You are separate from the body; let
go of the body. Let what happens to it; don’t resist. Some friends are
resisting, don’t do so. Let go. Don’t resist in the least. Let it happen
what happens to it... The body has to be wholly tired out. Cooperate
with the body. Allow everything that happens to it... The body has to
tire itself completely..aet go. Let go totally. Let what happens..aet
go. Let go. Don’t resist. See that you don’t resist. Don’t resist at
all. Let go. Let go utterly.</p><p><br></p><p>Now five minutes remain, so let go of the body wholly. Cooperate with
it in whatever happens to it. Whatever the body does, you cooperate with
it. Let it laugh if it chooses to. Let it cry if it wants to. Let it
dance if it begins to dance. Don’t obstruct, don’t resist. If it hops
let it. Let go. Let go entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>(Microphone stops working for a while as the operator left his job
and joined the meditation, and Osho had to lead meditation without the
help of mike.)</p><p><br></p><p>Let go of the body utterly. And allow fully whatever happens to it.
Let go with y our whole might. Let go. Now only two minutes are left to
go. So let go of the body absolutely... The body is separate from you
and you are separate from the body. Allow everything that happens to the
body... you are separate from the body. For two minutes leave the body
to itself absolutely. Then we go over to the third stage. Let go, let
go, let go of the body in every way... Breathe deeply and let go of the
body. Let the body be tired out..aet go. Let go. Let go. Breathe deeply
and let go of the body... If the body dances let it. Let go of it
completely... Bring your entire might to it before we enter the third
stage. Let go of the body; let go. Now only a minute remains, so let go
of the body utterly. And allow everything that happens to it. For one
minute let go absolutely. Let go. Let go. Let the body shout, cry and
laugh. Let go completely..aet the body do what it wants to do... You
will see clearly that you are separate and the body is separate. Let go
of the body absolutely, and then we go over to the third stage..aet go.
Let go... Cooperate with it. Let go of the body and enter the third
stage.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THIRD STAGE</p><p><br></p><p>Ask from within: “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Who am I?” For full ten minutes let the body dance and whirl, let deep
breath ing continue and continue asking inside, “Who</p><p>am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Exert
yourself fully and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am
I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking with
full strength, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking with full
strength, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am
I?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ask: “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who
am I?” Ask with your entire might, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am
I? Who am I? Who am I?” Ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Bring your entire energy to it and ask,
“Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Put into action your whole
energy and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who
am I? Who am I? Who am I?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now five minutes are in hand, so give of yourself wholly to the
question, and then we will relax and rest..aet go of the body and
continue asking from within, “Who am I? Who am I?” Exercise your entire
might, use your complete strength and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Bring
your whole energy to it and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Exert yourself
absolutely and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?” Apply yourself to the maximum
and ask, “Who am I? Who am I?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now only three minutes remain and then we will rest, so ask with all
your vigor, “Who am I? Who am I?” Tire yourself out. Energy is rising
within... “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Now only two
minutes, so ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Go on asking, “Who am
I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Last two minutes, and then we will
rest, so put into action your whole strength and ask, “Who am I? Who am
I?” Energy is awakening inside, so let the body dance with abandon. Let
go and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Let the
energy within awaken fully and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who
am I? Who am I?” Go utterly mad, and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Who am I?”... Tire yourself out, after which you will relax and
rest...”Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the last minute, “Who am I?” Let the body dance with abandon, if
it wants to...”Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Before we enter
into relaxation, bring your maximum energy into it. Exert yourself to
the maximum in this last minute, and ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Who am I?” Don’t miss the opportunity; exert yourself to the very
maximum...”Who am l? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” Put in
your last drop of energy, and then we enter relaxation, “Who am I? Who
am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOURTH STAGE</p><p><br></p><p>That’s all, no more. Drop everything. Drop asking, drop deep
breathing, stop all activity and keep lying wherever you are. Those who
are standing should keep standing. But if someone wants to sit or lie
down, he can... Let everything be still and quiet, quiet and empty...
Neither ask nor do anything. Just keep lying as if you are dead, as if
you are not... The storm has passed, leaving behind inner peace...
Everything has been erased... Everything is silent. The storm is gone...
so lie and relax, relax for these ten minutes. It is in this silence, in
this emptiness that he comes whom we have been seeking... Just keep
lying relaxed and quiet... No more deep breathing, no more asking “Who
am I?” Doing nothing. Give up everything. If you are standing keep
standing. If you have fallen on the ground, remain so. Keep lying if you
are already in that position. Be dead for these ten minutes, as if you
are no more... The storm is over and there is peace all around. There is
silence all over...</p><p>It is in this emptiness, in this void that something will happen,
some flower will bloom, some stream of peace will sprout forth, music of
bliss will be heard. It is in this very void that God comes. Await him,
await, await him... Keep lying, keep lying. Await, await, just await.
Everything is exhausted. Everything is empty... Await, await. I am now
going to be silent for ten minutes. And for these ten minutes you lie
quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>As if you are dead, as if you have disappeared. Only emptiness
remains. Everything is quiet. Every thing is peaceful. Everything is
silent. It is in this silence that God comes... This emptiness is the
gate through which he enters us. Await, just await... As if you are
dead. As if you have disappeared. The storm is gone leaving behind only
peace and tranquility. Await, await, just awaiting...</p><p><br></p><p>It is in this very moment that something hap pens. Await silently.
Await silently. Everything is empty, void. Await. Await. Await... As if
you are no more; but someone within is awake. Everything is empty, void;
but inside a light is shining that sees, knows and understands. You are
effaced, but some entity within is awake... It is all light inside.
Streams of bliss flow within. God is very near. Await. Await... As if
you are dead. As if you are no more. As if you have disappeared. As if
you are wiped out. Lose yourself the way a drop loses itself in the
ocean... Await quietly...</p><p><br></p><p>It is in this losing that one wins, one attains. Just await. A quiet
and silent light shines within. Inside you a deep bliss shines forth.
Within you a river of bliss is going to flow. Just await. Await... Bliss
will flow within. Light will descend within. Awaiting, awaiting and
awaiting. As if you are no more. As if you are dead. As if you have
disappeared. Everything has turned void.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is in this void that you have God’s darshan, his vision. It is
in this void that you get his glimpse. And it is in this void that you
attain to him. Await. Await. Await... See within, someone is arriving.
See within, someone is awakened. See with in, some bliss has become
manifest – a bliss that you have never known, that is utterly unfamiliar
and un known. See, every fiber of your being is filled with something
unearthly. Await. Await...</p><p><br></p><p>Now bliss and bliss alone remains. Now light and light alone remains.
Peace and peace alone re mains. Await. Just await. In such silent
moments he comes. In such silent moments you meet him. Await. Await.
Await... He whom you are seeking is very close by. He whom you are
searching for is near at hand. Await. Just await. Await silently.</p><p><br></p><p>Now slowly come back from the world of bliss. Now slowly, slowly come
back from the world of light. Very gently leave the inner world. And
open your eyes very slowly and gently. If your eyes don’t open then
cover them with your palms and then open them gently. No one should
hurry though. Those who have fallen down and find it difficult to rise
should first breathe deeply and then rise very slowly. Rise up very
silently. Without speaking, without any noise. And those standing should
sit down very silently, and open their eyes gently. Come back from the
world of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>The morning session is over.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyan Sarjano.\nDhyan means meditation. Sarjano means creativity.\nMeditation opens many doors in life. It is a multidimensional phenomenon. The most important dimension is creativity. Those who think that they are creators without knowing anything of meditation are not really creators. At the most they will, can be called composers: they take fragments from here and there and put them together. Their creativity is not something original. It is more or less a collage. It is not original because mind cannot be original. That is intrinsically impossible, that is not the nature of the mind.\nMind is always borrowed, it is always old. It is never new, never fresh, because mind is nothing but a memory system. It accumulates the past, it is the record of the past.\nYes, you can find few things from that record and put them together -- call it poetry, painting, sculpture, but it is not creativity.\nCreativity, to be creativity, has to be fresh, young, of the present, of the now, of\nthe here. It has to be an 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\noverflowing ecstasy and it can come only from the depth of meditation, not from the surface of the mind.\nMind is just your superficial part and meditation takes us to your very core, to the innermost shrine, to our consciousness. Our of that consciousness whatsoever happens has something unique about it. It is for the first time, it is always for the first time. Then whether one writes poetry or paints does not matter.\nBuddha never wrote a single word, never painted, never made any sculpture, yet, his whole life is creative. Even if he sits silently doing nothing there is that aura of creativity around. Even in his non-doing immensities are happening, even his silence is a song. When he does not say something even by not saying he is saying, he is giving a message. The way he sits, the way he walks, the way he looks, it is all creative.\nEach single gesture of a man like Buddha or Jesus has the flavour of creativity in it.\nAnd it is possible only if one goes to the deepest core of one's being. One has to shift from the mind and dive deep. One has to stop clinging to the mind.\nThe clinging with the mind is our problem; the moment when we uncling, immediately meditation happens. Meditation can be defined as non-clinging to the mind, getting unidentified with the mind, entering an inner space where there is no thought, no desire, no memory, no imagination, where all the functioning of the mind has simply ceased.\nIn that absolute silence god starts flowing through you. That is creativity, the flow of the divine through you. You simply become a hollow bamboo flute and something from the beyond takes possession of you.\nReal creativity has not your signature on it; it has god's signature on it. This is your name: Swami Dhyan Anand.\nDhyan means meditation. Anand means bliss.\nMind is misery and cannot be otherwise, because mind lives in desires, ambitions, it is always hankering for the more -- and that hankering cannot be satisfied. It always goes on jumping ahead of you, wherever you would be, the mind will be asking for more. It is always ahead of you. The distance between you and the mind always remains the same. You have this much money, the distance is there. You can have that much money, the dame distance is there. Mind is just like the horizon: it looks you can reach, it seems just few miles away, but by the time you have reached there it has gone ahead of you. it is moving with you. The distance remains constant, not even a single inch less. The beggar is in the same misery as the emperor, because the distance is the same.\nAnd it is the distance that creates the misery because it is always frustration, always a wound. It hurts that \"I have not been able to fulfil myself,\" but nobody has ever been able to fulfil through the mind.\nMind's very texture consists of unfulfilment. Hence the people who teach peace of mind are doing simply something very absurd. Nothing like that has ever existed. It cannot exist. Peace of mind is a contradiction in terms.\nOne very famous Jewish thinker, Joshua Liebman has written a book. The title is PEACE OF MIND. It is a well-known book but from the very beginning it is absurd. Peace of mind is almost equivalent to saying\n\"healthy disease\". Either you are healthy or you are not healthy, but one cannot be healthily sick. It is impossible.\nMind is sick. It is very sickness. One can get out of the mind, and that is what meditation is. Meditation is not peace of mind, it is transcendence of mind, and that distinction has to be remembered. Because the Christian priests, the Jewish rabbis, the Mohammedan priests, the Hindu priests, they all talk about peace of mind, and this is not the way the awakened ones have said.\nThe awakened ones are all agreed about one thing, that you have to go beyond mind, only then there is peace. In mind there is no peace. Mind is the turmoil,\nthe noise. It is the very hell, but it can be transcended.\nBecause we are not our mind, we are something totally different, so we can step over it, we can go beyond it, we can use it as a stepping stone, as a ladder.\nThe hell of the mind can become a ladder to the heaven of meditation-and that's my whole work here: to use the mind in such a way that you can go beyond it. And once you have tasted even a single moment of that beyondness, of that transcendence, then everything becomes clear. Then one knows why there has been misery: it was the cause that was causing it.\nThe moment you are no more on the mind suddenly there is bliss. Not that you have to seek for it -- it is already there -- just we are so much engrossed in the mind that we cannot look at our own centre. At the centre there is absolute bliss and nothing else. It is waiting for us. All that is needed is a one-hundred-eighty- degree turn. Right now our back is towards our centre and our face is toward the world 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n-- this is the state of mind.\nJust the opposite is the state of meditation: when your back is towards the world and your face is towards your centre, suddenly you become aware of something that has always been there. You have not lost it even for a single moment. It is your very nature to be blissful. Meditation gives you only that which you have had always. It simply makes you aware of your reality. It does not bring anything new in. It simply reveals you the treasure that is lying there ignored and neglected, and you are running all over the world for it. You will not find it anywhere else because it is within you.\nMind is misery, meditation is bliss. Mind is misery because it takes you away from your nature and meditation is bliss because it brings you back to your nature, it brings you back home.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Nirmal.\nDhyan means meditation. Nirmal means innocence.\nMind is knowledge, meditation is innocence. It is childlike innocence; hence the significance of Jesus'\nstatement, \"Unless you are like small children you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.\" It is very pregnant.\nThis sentence defines the very essence of meditation.\nBecome again innocent. Unlearn all that has been imposed upon you. Be in a state of not-knowing and suddenly the kingdom of god is yours. You have not to wait for it. It is immediately yours.\nInnocence opens your heart to existence; knowledge keeps you closed. Knowledge is cunning, calculating. Knowledge is always like a wall between you and existence. Innocence is a bridge. In innocence nothing divides you from existence. You are part of the flowers and the stars, the animals, the birds, the rocks, the rivers, you are part and they are part of you. A certain communion starts happening.\nYou start having a rhythmic relationship with existence; then everything rejoices in you.\nJust a small flower, a grass flower and it opens doors to mysteries - it awakens great wonders in you.\nSmall things of life start turning into something extraordinary and sacred, once you have the mirror of innocence to reflect them.\nMeditation can be reduced to a single word: innocence, a state of not-knowing. Don't be a Hindu, don't be a Christian, don't be a Mohammedan, don't be a communist, a fascist, a socialist; just be innocent, childlike, someone who knows nothing.\nIn that not-knowing real knowing becomes possible. In that not-knowing wisdom happens. Wisdom is not information, it is transformation.\nYou become new, you are born anew. It is a resurrection. The old dies, and each moment the old goes on dying and each moment the new goes on being born,\nlife becomes such an alive phenomenon that each moment the dead simply is dropped, and the new asserts. The old leaves go on falling and the new leaves go on growing, the old flowers go on disappearing, new flowers go on opening. When life is such a continuum, a process, a riverlike phenomenon, then the ocean is yours. Then sooner or later you will become the ocean.\nIn my observation even sinners are far closer than the scholars - to god, to truth, to freedom. The pundits, the rabbis, the imams, the ayatollahs, the popes, these are the people who can never know what truth is.\nSwami Dhyan Chinmaya. Dhyan means meditation. Chinmaya means consciousness.\nMan ordinarily lives a very unconscious life, almost like a robot, a sleepwalker, a somnambulist. He goes on doing things but all is mechanical. He is not aware what he is doing, he is not watchful of his own acts, he is not alert about his own thoughts. He is so much identified with his feelings, emotions, moods, that he cannot watch. Watching needs a certain distance. And he is so closed that when he becomes angry he really becomes anger, not just angry. And when he is greedy he is not just greedy, he is greed.\nAnd the same is the case with all his emotions, feelings, thoughts, actions. The identification is a state of unconsciousness and this identification has to be broken, hammered, so a distance can be created, so you can see what you are doing.\nEating you can see, walking you can see. A moment comes when even while you are sleeping you can see. Something in you remains still alert and aware, just like a small flame inside. The body is fast asleep, you may be snoring, you can hear it yourself. It is a rare phenomenon but it happen, it happens: hearing yourself snoring is something like a miracle, but it is possible. As your awareness grows slowly slowly you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecome capable of watching your body in all its acts, then your mind in all its\nactivities, then your heart.\nOf course, the hardest to watch is the heart and the easiest to watch is the body, and between the two is the mind; hence begin with the body and end on the heart. Once you can watch all the three, these three concentric circles around your centre, meditation has started growing in you, the spring has come.\nWhen one is capable of watching all the three without any mistake, constantly, with no lapse, with no gaps, then the fourth happens. That fourth is called Chinmaya, the real consciousness, the enlightenment, the Buddhahood, the Christ-consciousness.\nIn the East we have only called it the fourth; we have not given it any name because names create trouble, words create trouble. Words are immediately caught by the scholars, philosophers, theologians, and they start spinning and weaving theories around them and they distort everything.\nHence we have decided in the East to call it only by a number, the fourth. Now you cannot do anything with the number, fourth. There is no possibility of interpretation, you cannot impose any idea on it -- the fourth is simply the fourth, it is only a number. It simply indicates only one thing, that you have passed the three concentric circles and has reached to the fourth, the centre. And that centre is the beginning of god or the experience of godliness, the beginning of eternity or the experience of timelessness, the beginning of true life which knows no death, which is beyond birth and death both. This is the search, the search of all the true seekers: to taste the eternal, the absolute, the immortal. And it is possible because it is part of us.\nWe are both, the world and the beyond. The world is those three concentric circles. Those are the three dimensions of the world and the fourth is the beyond, penetrating the world, a ray of light penetrating the layers of darkness.\nGetting unidentified and becoming aware -- that's the whole process of sannyas.\nSwami Dhyan Premda. Dhyan means meditation; Premda means one who is capable of giving love.\nMeditation makes you so blissful, so OVERflowingly blissful that after it there is only one thing left and that is sharing of your bliss -- and that's what love is all about.\nTrue love is not a beggar but an emperor. It is the untrue love which begs, which desires, which wants something should be given. And the strange thing that is happening in the world always is that all are beggars, beggars begging from other beggars. Nobody had anything to give and everybody wants everything to get. Naturally there is chaos, conflict, misery, and everybody feels cheated. In fact nobody is cheating; all are beggars. Everybody feels sooner or later disillusioned but the disillusionment is for wrong reasons.\nThey think that the people they loved deceived them. It is not so; nobody is deceiving you, except yourself. Unless one is full of bliss one cannot be loving. One can only desire love but one cannot share.\nDone has nothing to share.\nMeditation releases your love juices, it releases your loving fragrance, and then you can share, you can give. Of course when you give existence returns it thousandfold. Existence is not misery, but you have first to give. You have to fulfil that basic requirement -- then you get. It is like you sow few seeds and then things grow, and each tree brings millions of seeds.\nYou had grown only one seed and each single seed brings millions of seeds. You just give a little love and wait and see: love starts flowing towards you from all nooks and corners of existence, but for that you have to have first. Hence meditation comes first; love is its shadow, its by-product, its consequence.\nMeditation has to happen within you so your imprisoned splendour is released, then love comes on its own accord. And a life with meditation and love is a fulfilled life.\nSwami Dhyan Nartano. Dhyan means meditation; Nartano means a dance.\nMeditation has not to be taken seriously (laughter); take it sincerely but not seriously. Meditation has to be a playfulness, it has to be rejoiced in. One has to dance, to celebrate. Life is known only by those who are capable of celebrating it. And don't wait for miracles to happen, then you will not celebrate. Then you will never celebrate.\nMiracles certainly happen but they happen only to people who know how to celebrate! And there are millions of fools around the world who are waiting for some miracle to happen, then they will celebrate, but this is not possible. They\nare putting the horses behind the cart. The cart is never going to move. Even the horses will not be able to move because of the cart. Freed from the cart at least the horses could have 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmoved, and the owner will be stuck in the cart. Everything has become stagnant because some basic misunderstandings which have become very prevalent, deep- rooted.\nThere have been people who have made them established because they serve their vested interests. All the priests around the world have been trying to make man serious, sad, sombre, a long face. They are all afraid of laughter -- laughter is really dangerous, it is almost like a dynamite. If the world, even for twenty- four hours decides that \"We will laugh at everything\" (laughter) -- just twenty- four hours -- and all your politicians will commit suicide, and all your priests will jump into the ocean, and all your saints will hang themselves. Just within twenty-four hours there will be such a great revolution in the world. It will be such a deep cleansing phenomenon, it will clean all dirt. But people have completely forgotten low to laugh; in fact they think to laugh is profane: one has to be serious, when you enter the church even if you are laughing, you become serious, you become stiff, you become uptight.\nChurch should be a place of dancing and singing, rejoicing. One should invite Jesus also to participate, and call god the father also, but \"Have a little fun! Why you are hanging above the clouds so long? Come down!\" But all the religious places have become sad. They are in the hands of ill people, sick people.\nLaughter is tremendously healthy. Playfulness is as sacred as any prayer or maybe more sacred than any prayer, because playfulness, laughter, singing, dancing, will relax you. And only the truth is possible in a relaxed state of being. When you are totally relaxed, in a state of let-go, the impossible starts happening, the miracle starts happening. Let-go is the secret of meditation.\nNirvana now or never Chapter #16\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3116","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/>Nirvana Now Or Never</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3116 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nirvana_Now_Or_Never/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

non-clinging to the mind, getting unidentified with the mind, entering
an inner space where there is no thought, no desire, no memory, no
imagination, where all the functioning of the mind has simply
ceased.</p><p>In that absolute silence god starts flowing through you. That is
creativity, the flow of the divine through you. You simply become a
hollow bamboo flute and something from the beyond takes possession of
you.</p><p>Real <span class=p>creativity has not your signature on it; it has
god's signature on it. This is your name: Swami Dhyan Anand.</span></p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Anand means bliss.</p><p>Mind is misery and cannot be otherwise, because mind lives in
desires, ambitions, it is always hankering for the more -- and that
hankering cannot be satisfied. It always goes on jumping ahead of you,
wherever you would be, the mind will be asking for more. It is always
ahead of you. The distance between you and the mind always remains the
same. You have this much money, the distance is there. You can have that
much money, the dame distance is there. Mind is just like the horizon:
it looks you can reach, it seems just few miles away, but by the time
you have reached there it has gone ahead of you. it is moving with you.
The distance remains constant, not even a single inch less. The beggar
is in the same misery as the emperor, because the distance is the
same.</p><p>And it is the distance that creates the misery because it is always
frustration, always a wound. It hurts that "I have not been able to
fulfil myself," but nobody has ever been able to fulfil through the
mind.</p><p>Mind's very texture consists of unfulfilment. Hence the people who
teach peace of mind are doing simply something very absurd. Nothing like
that has ever existed. It <em>cannot</em> exist. Peace of mind is a
contradiction in terms.</p><p>One very famous Jewish thinker, Joshua Liebman has written a book.
The title is PEACE OF MIND. It is a well-known book but from the very
beginning it is absurd. Peace of mind is almost equivalent to saying</p><p>"healthy disease". Either you are healthy or you are not healthy, but
one cannot be healthily sick. It is impossible.</p><p>Mind is sick. It is very sickness. One can get out of the mind, and
that is what meditation is. Meditation is not peace of mind, it is
transcendence of mind, and that distinction has to be remembered.
Because the Christian priests, the Jewish rabbis, the Mohammedan
priests, the Hindu priests, they all talk about peace of mind, and this
is not the way the awakened ones have said.</p><p>The awakened ones are all agreed about one thing, that you have to go
beyond mind, only then there is peace. In mind there is no peace. Mind
is the turmoil,</p><p>the noise. It is the very hell, but it can be transcended.</p><p>Because we are <em>not</em> our mind, we are something totally
different, so we can step over it, we can go beyond it, we can use it as
a stepping stone, as a ladder.</p><p>The hell of the mind can become a ladder to the heaven of
meditation-and that's my whole work here: to use the mind in such a way
that you can go beyond it. And once you have tasted even a single moment
of that beyondness, of that transcendence, then everything becomes
clear. Then one knows why there has been misery: it was the cause that
was causing it.</p><p>The moment you are no more on the mind suddenly there is bliss. Not
that you have to seek for it -- it is already there -- just we are so
much engrossed in the mind that we cannot look at our own centre. At the
centre there is absolute bliss and nothing else. It is waiting for us.
All that is needed is a one-hundred-eighty- degree turn. Right now our
back is towards our centre and our face is toward the world 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>-- this is the state of mind.</p><p>Just the opposite is the state of meditation: when your back is
towards the world and your face is towards your centre, suddenly you
become aware of something that has always been there. You have not lost
it even for a single moment. It is your very nature to be blissful.
Meditation gives you only that which you have had always. It simply
makes you aware of your reality. It does not bring anything new in. It
simply reveals you the treasure that is lying there ignored and
neglected, and you are running all over the world for it. You will not
find it anywhere else because it is within you.</p><p>Mind is misery, meditation is bliss. Mind is misery because it takes
you away from your nature and meditation is bliss because it brings you
back to your nature, it brings you back home.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Nirmal.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Nirmal means innocence.</p><p>Mind is knowledge, meditation is innocence. It is childlike
innocence; hence the significance of Jesus'</p><p>statement, "Unless you are like small children you shall not enter
into my kingdom of god." It is very pregnant.</p><p>This sentence defines the very essence of meditation.</p><p>Become again innocent. Unlearn all that has been imposed upon you. Be
in a state of not-knowing and suddenly the kingdom of god is yours. You
have not to wait for it. It is immediately yours.</p><p>Innocence opens your heart to existence; knowledge keeps you closed.
Knowledge is cunning, calculating. Knowledge is always like a wall
between you and existence. Innocence is a bridge. In innocence nothing
divides you from existence. You are part of the flowers and the stars,
the animals, the birds, the rocks, the rivers, you are part and they are
part of you. A certain communion starts happening.</p><p>You start having a rhythmic relationship with existence; then
everything rejoices in you.</p><p>Just a small flower, a grass flower and it opens doors to mysteries -
it awakens great wonders in you.</p><p>Small things of life start turning into something extraordinary and
sacred, once you have the mirror of innocence to reflect them.</p><p>Meditation can be reduced to a single word: innocence, a state of
not-knowing. Don't be a Hindu, don't be a Christian, don't be a
Mohammedan, don't be a communist, a fascist, a socialist; just be
innocent, childlike, someone who knows nothing.</p><p>In that not-knowing real knowing becomes possible. In that
not-knowing wisdom happens. Wisdom is not information, it is
transformation.</p><p>You become new, you are born anew. It is a resurrection. The old
dies, and each moment the old goes on dying and each moment the new goes
on being born,</p><p>life becomes such an alive phenomenon that each moment the dead
simply is dropped, and the new asserts. The old leaves go on falling and
the new leaves go on growing, the old flowers go on disappearing, new
flowers go on opening. When life is such a continuum, a process, a
riverlike phenomenon, then the ocean is yours. Then sooner or later you
will become the ocean.</p><p>In my observation even sinners are far closer than the scholars - to
god, to truth, to freedom. The pundits, the rabbis, the imams, the
ayatollahs, the popes, these are the people who can never know what
truth is.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Chinmaya. Dhyan means meditation. Chinmaya means
consciousness.</p><p>Man ordinarily lives a very unconscious life, almost like a robot, a
sleepwalker, a somnambulist. He goes on doing things but all is
mechanical. He is not aware what he is doing, he is not watchful of his
own acts, he is not alert about his own thoughts. He is so much
identified with his feelings, emotions, moods, that he cannot watch.
Watching needs a certain distance. And he is so closed that when he
becomes angry he really becomes anger, not just angry. And when he is
greedy he is not just greedy, he is greed.</p><p>And the same is the case with all his emotions, feelings, thoughts,
actions. The identification is a state of unconsciousness and this
identification has to be broken, hammered, so a distance can be created,
so you can see what you are doing.</p><p>Eating you can see, walking you can see. A moment comes when even
while you are sleeping you can see. Something in you remains still alert
and aware, just like a small flame inside. The body is fast asleep, you
may be snoring, you can hear it yourself. It is a rare phenomenon but it
happen, it happens: hearing yourself snoring is something like a
miracle, but it is possible. As your awareness grows slowly slowly you

in all its</p><p>activities, then your heart.</p><p>Of course, the hardest to watch is the heart and the easiest to watch
is the body, and between the two is the mind; hence begin with the body
and end on the heart. Once you can watch all the three, these three
concentric circles around your centre, meditation has started growing in
you, the spring has come.</p><p>When one is capable of watching all the three without any mistake,
constantly, with no lapse, with no gaps, then the fourth happens. That
fourth is called Chinmaya, the <em>real</em> consciousness, the
enlightenment, the Buddhahood, the Christ-consciousness.</p><p>In the East we have only called it the fourth; we have not given it
any name because names create trouble, words create trouble. Words are
immediately caught by the scholars, philosophers, theologians, and they
start spinning and weaving theories around them and they distort
everything.</p><p>Hence we have decided in the East to call it only by a number, the
fourth. Now you cannot do anything with the number, fourth. There is no
possibility of interpretation, you cannot impose any idea on it -- the
fourth is simply the fourth, it is only a number. It simply indicates
only one thing, that you have passed the three concentric circles and
has reached to the fourth, the centre. And that centre is the beginning
of god or the experience of godliness, the beginning of eternity or the
experience of timelessness, the beginning of true life which knows no
death, which is beyond birth and death both. This is the search, the
search of all the true seekers: to taste the eternal, the absolute, the
immortal. And it is possible because it is part of us.</p><p>We are both, the world and the beyond. The world is those three
concentric circles. Those are the three dimensions of the world and the
fourth is the beyond, penetrating the world, a ray of light penetrating
the layers of darkness.</p><p>Getting unidentified and becoming aware -- that's the whole process
of sannyas.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Premda. Dhyan means meditation; Premda means one who is
capable of giving love.</p><p>Meditation makes you so blissful, so OVERflowingly blissful that
after it there is only one thing left and that is sharing of your bliss
-- and that's what love is all about.</p><p>True love is not a beggar but an emperor. It is the untrue love which
begs, which desires, which wants something should be given. And the
strange thing that is happening in the world always is that all are
beggars, beggars begging from other beggars. Nobody had anything to give
and everybody wants everything to get. Naturally there is chaos,
conflict, misery, and everybody feels cheated. In fact nobody is
cheating; <em>all</em> are beggars. Everybody feels sooner or later
disillusioned but the disillusionment is for wrong reasons.</p><p>They think that the people they loved deceived them. It is not so;
nobody is deceiving you, except yourself. Unless one is full of bliss
one cannot be loving. One can only desire love but one cannot share.</p><p>Done has nothing to share.</p><p>Meditation releases your love juices, it releases your loving
fragrance, and then you can share, you can give. Of course when you give
existence returns it thousandfold. Existence is not misery, but you have
first to give. You have to fulfil that basic requirement -- then you
get. It is like you sow few seeds and then things grow, and each tree
brings millions of seeds.</p><p>You had grown only one seed and each single seed brings millions of
seeds. You just give a little love and wait and see: love starts flowing
towards you from all nooks and corners of existence, but for that you
have to have first. Hence meditation comes first; love is its shadow,
its by-product, its consequence.</p><p>Meditation has to happen within you so your imprisoned splendour is
released, then love comes on its own accord. And a life with meditation
and love is a fulfilled life.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Nartano. Dhyan means meditation; Nartano means a
dance.</p><p>Meditation has not to be taken seriously (laughter); take it
sincerely but not seriously. Meditation has to be a playfulness, it has
to be rejoiced in. One has to dance, to celebrate. Life is known only by
those who are capable of celebrating it. And don't wait for miracles to
happen, then you will not celebrate. Then you will <em>never</em>
celebrate.</p><p>Miracles certainly happen but they happen only to people who know how
to celebrate! And there are millions of fools around the world who are
waiting for some miracle to happen, <em>then</em> they will celebrate,
but this is not possible. They</p><p>are putting the horses behind the cart. The cart is never going to
move. Even the horses will not be able to move because of the cart.

stagnant because some basic misunderstandings which have become very
prevalent, deep- rooted.</p><p>There have been people who have made them established because they
serve their vested interests. All the priests around the world have been
trying to make man serious, sad, sombre, a long face. They are all
afraid of laughter -- laughter is really dangerous, it is almost like a
dynamite. If the world, even for twenty- four hours decides that "We
will laugh at everything" (laughter) -- just twenty- four hours -- and
all your politicians will commit suicide, and all your priests will jump
into the ocean, and all your saints will hang themselves. Just within
twenty-four hours there will be such a great revolution in the world. It
will be such a deep cleansing phenomenon, it will clean all dirt. But
people have completely forgotten low to laugh; in fact they think to
laugh is profane: one has to be serious, when you enter the church even
if you are laughing, you become serious, you become stiff, you become
uptight.</p><p>Church should be a place of dancing and singing, rejoicing. One
should invite Jesus also to participate, and call god the father also,
but "Have a little fun! Why you are hanging above the clouds so long?
Come down!" But all the religious places have become sad. They are in
the hands of ill people, sick people.</p><p>Laughter is tremendously healthy. Playfulness is as sacred as any
prayer or maybe more sacred than any prayer, because playfulness,
laughter, singing, dancing, will relax you. And only the truth is
possible in a relaxed state of being. When you are totally relaxed, in a
state of let-go, the impossible starts happening, the miracle starts
happening. Let-go is the secret of meditation.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #16</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

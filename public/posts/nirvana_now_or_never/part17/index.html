It is for reference purposes only.]\nMa Dhyan Leslie. Dhyan means meditation, Leslie means calm spirit.\nMan has tried many ways to be calm, quiet, but all other efforts except meditation have failed, because all other efforts are basically of cultivation, of practice. One can cultivate a certain calmness, one can make it a discipline of life, but it will be only superficial. Behind the thin layer of calmness there will always be turmoil and any small accident, any small scratch on the surface and you will erupt like a volcano.\nIn fact the people who murder, the people who commit suicide are the people who are normally very calm. The people who are normally easily angered never commit murder, never commit suicide, for the simple reason because they never\naccumulate so much anger. They go on throwing their anger every day, they flush it out of their system. But the people who try to be calm, repress, and the repressed remains alive, not only alive, in it becomes more and more powerful as time passes by, because you are repressing every day. it goes on piling up within and there is a limit to everything. One day the balloon is bound to burst.\nBut meditation works in a totally different way: it is not cultivation, it is not a discipline from the outside, it has nothing to do directly with calmness, silence, equilibrium. On the contrary, meditation works in a totally different dimension, the dimension of awareness. One simply becomes more and more aware of one's acts, thoughts, feelings. As this awareness deepens, as a by-product calmness of spirit comes on its own accord. Then it comes from your innermost core.\nThe cultivated calmness remains on the circumference, the calmness that comes as a consequence of meditation grows from the centre and spreads towards the circumference; hence there is never any hypocrisy, never any split, never a schizophrenic state. You are not divided in two: the surface is one and your reality is just the opposite of it. Humanity has suffered too much from that cultivated calmness.\nIt is time that we should get rid of all the methods of cultivation and we should go for a direct approach, we should go to the very root of the matter and the root is in the centre, not on the circumference. on the circumference only flowers show. And if you want real flowers then you have to nourish the roots, you have to water the roots, you have to take care of the roots -- that's what meditation does -- and then roses come on the surface.\nIf you don't work on the roots, in the centre, if you don't get centred through meditation and grounded, then at the most that you can do is, you can buy plastic flowers and arrange them around your circumference. But that is missing the whole opportunity of life.\nLife is an opportunity to grow your centre, your potential, your very being, because only your being in its total flowering is god. There is no other god.\nHow long you will be here?\n(Probably about two months this time) Two?\n(About two months I think this time) You will be here?\nYes\nAnd then come back again for a longer period. I will need you here. Good. Swami Dhyan simon. Dhyan means meditation, Simon means gracious being.\nJesus says again and again 'If you have ears then hear, if you have eyes then see.' Certainly he was not talking to deaf and to the blinds; he was talking to ordinary people just like you and everybody else. They had ears and they had eyes. Then what he means by having ears and by having eyes? He means a totally different way of seeing and hearing.\nOne can hear in three ways. Either in a very indifferent attitude, as if one cannot care less -- that is ungracious hearing, that is not the way to commune with a Jesus or a Buddha, that is not the way to be in the presence of a master. That is not the way of a disciple.\nThe second way of hearing is antagonistic hearing. You are already full of prejudices, you have already concluded that what is right and what is not, not knowing at all what is right and what is wrong you have accepted certain assumptions given by others, by the society which has brought you up, by the education, by 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyour parents, by the church, certain a priori beliefs. Clinging to those beliefs one can hear but that is again ungracious hearing, because you are not hearing, you are fighting.| It is better than the first -- indifferent hearing -- because it is impossible to change any person who is indifferent.\nIt is possible to change the second person; even if though he is antagonistic, he is getting a certain negative kind of relationship. He is becoming an enemy and an\nenemy can be made a friend.\nThe indifferent is unapproachable. he is not even an enemy -- how can you expect him to be a friend?\nHe is not even ready to hate you -- how can he love you? That is the impossible case.\nBut the second can be converted, but it will take unnecessarily long time, because the fight will destroy the energy. And even if sometimes he comes to acceptance it will be very reluctantly and he will always go on watching for some flaw so that he can again go back to his old pattern. He will be always wavering. He will be not really surrendered. Even if he comes to surrender his surrender will be with strings attached to it.\nHe can withdraw any moment.\nA real master never takes any note of the first. he simply drops the idea of the first category. he takes a little bit notice of the second category but only for a short time, just to see whether it is possible or the case is too time-absorbing, too much unnecessary hassle -- then he drops the second also.\nHe accepts only the third -- the gracious person -- who can hear, simply hear, without any prejudice for or against. Remember, gracious-hearing does not mean what Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans have been telling to people. They are telling wrong things; they are telling gracious-hearing means hearing as a believer. That is not gracious.\nWhether you believe or disbelieve you have already taken a standpoint, you are already prejudiced, you have already got a certain mind and with the mind there is no grace.\nGracious hearing is with meditation, with no-mind. You don't have any prejudice, for or against. You are non-judgemental. You are simply available, open, vulnerable. You have not decided anything; you are just an enquirer. Then the hearing has tremendous grace.\nAnd truth has one intrinsic quality: if you hear it with unprejudiced consciousness it immediately reaches to your heart, it immediately triggers a process of transformation in you. An immediate contact with the master becomes\npossible if one can hear without any belief, disbelief, without any idea of what truth is, if one can hear just like a child, from a state of not-knowing. that state is meditation and it is only through meditation that the master becomes available, the truth becomes available, and ultimately, everything that is of value happens through it.\nI say to you that if you hear silently without any prejudice you will immediately know what is true.\nAnother thing has to be also added: you will also immediately know without any thought process what is not true. Truth is self-evident, it needs no proof. And because truth is self-evident, untruth is also self-evident.\nAll that is needed on your part is to be totally available and immediately you will know what is truth and what is not. And to know what is truth liberates! It is deliverance. It brings to your life the ultimate joy, the ultimate flowering, the ultimate fragrance of existence.\nMa Dhyan Sylvie. Dhyan means meditation. Sylvie comes from Sylvanus. Sylvanus is a mythological god of the woods an the forest. It symbolises profound solitude. A virgin solitude which prevails in a forest where nobody has gone. It is a beautiful name.\nMeditation takes you to your inner woods, inner forest, where nobody has ever gone. Only you can go and you have not gone yet. It is not possible for anybody else to go to your innermost core; it is absolutely private, categorically private. That is the only place which is private, everything else can be shared.\nSooner or later there will be ways to reach people's minds, mechanically. If it is possible to make a cardiogram it is not very far that it will be possible to read the mind waves, just like a cardiogram. You have to be attached to a machine and the machine immediately will start screening. Much will be just doodling because inside much is doodling but once in a while something relevant will turn up. Ninety per cent will be rubbish, but mind too cannot remain for long private.\nThere is only one place in you which will always remain private, and that which is intrinsically private is yours. Everything else belongs to the public. Even your mind belongs to the public because it is created by your parents, the priests, the politicians. Even your conscience belongs to the public because they have created it. What is wrong, what is not to be done, what should be done, all the\ncommandments, the idea of sin an virtue -- it is created by others. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy concern is to help you to discover your innermost solitude, the profound silence that prevails at the very centre of your being -- the centre of the cyclone.\nOnly then one knows what life is all about. Only then one knows the meaning, the significance, only then one knows the beauty, the truth, only then one knows all that is worth knowing.\nMeditation is a passage from the circumference. it is a bridge. Its another name is awareness. Learn to be aware.\nAs your awareness becomes more and more clear, more and more sharp, you will become aware that you are coming closer and closer to a place where immense silence has prevailed for eternity. That is the real temple of god. All other temples are man's creations and all other gods are creations of man in his own image. If one wants to discover the true god, then one has to go within oneself.\nYour own original face is the face of the true god.\nMa Dhyan Elisabeth. Dhyan means meditation, Elisabeth means consecrated to god, surrendered to god, totally devoted to god.\nOne cannot be surrendered to god just by believing in a certain god -- Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan. how can one be surrendered to a belief. Deep down, hidden behind the belief there is always doubt. They exist together, they are two sides of the same coin. On one side it is belief, on the other side it is doubt. In fact the belief is needed only to repress doubt. if there is no doubt there is no need for belief at all.\nSo all believers are bogus, all believers are phony they are simply repressing\ntheir doubt by making a great system of belief to repress it, creating a big structure of believe, repeating the Bible every day or the Gita or the Koran, chanting mantras of the Vedas and just making much fuss, creating much smoke so they can forget that there is doubt inside them. And the worm of the doubt goes on and on working and working inside, it goes on eating their very heart. And they go on befooling themselves and others by superficial beliefs.\nI don't teach belief because belief can never become a surrender. It is only love that becomes surrender.\nAnd love is not a question of belief, because love is not of the mind at all. Love is a question of experience.\nIn religious terms love can be called trust. That is the same word; there is no difference between love and trust. Love is always trusting, trust is always loving. That is only a religious way of saying that it is love that makes surrender possible. But how love will happen if you have not seen god? How can you love a god that you have not seen, that you have not heard, that you have not experienced not even in your dreams, not even a far away echo? -- it is impossible. It is asking for something superhuman from poor human beings; asking something so illogical, simply creates trouble for them. They are already in much trouble and religions create even more troubles for them.\nThat's why you will see religious people much more in anxiety than the so-called irreligious. You will find religious people much more sad and miserable than the so-called irreligious. The irreligious laugh too, dance too, sing too; the religious has no time. He is so guilt-ridden, so much worried, because what he wants to do he cannot do. Even a man like Saint Augustine says in his CONFESSIONS, 'God help me, because what I do is that which should not be done and what I do not do is that which should be done, and I have tried my best, but it seems impossible for me -- unless you help me I will not be able to make it.'\nIf this is the situation of Augustine, a so-called great Christian saint, then what about the poor Christians, how they can make it? When they cannot make it, when they fall short, they feel guilty, they feel that they are sinners. And the whole problem is absolutely unnecessary. it is fabricated by our stupidity; hence I wan you to be-pass all this nonsense.\nThe simple thing, the simplest is to be silent, to be aware, to be watchful, forget\nall about beliefs and religions and dogmas and philosophies and ideologies; just become silent, aware. And you will be surprised: in those moments of awareness and silence you start having glimpses of the divine. And those glimpses make it possible -- not that you have to surrender, the surrender happens, just as you fall in love. Not that you have to fall in love with somebody -- it is not a question of doing something.\nIf you are ordered that 'Elisabeth, go and fall in love with this man,' what you will do? You will be at a loss. How one can fall in love? One can pretend, one can act but one cannot fall in love and deep down one will know that it is all false, pseudo. And people have been told to fall in love with god, whom they have never seen, whom they don't know whether he exists at all. They have no idea about god or godliness. They are not even aware of their own selves, what they can say about god? And these poor human beings are tortured by the priests, continuously sermonised, 'Surrender to god and surrender totally and surrender 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- perfectly.'\nThis is not possible; only through meditation glimpses start happening and then you have to fall. Not that you have to do something, it simply happens. it is a happening. And when it happens on its own accord it has a tremendous beauty to it.\nSwami Dhyan Earle. Dhyan means meditation, Earle means a noble man, nobleness, nobility.\nMeditation certainly brings great nobility but not according to the ideas of people, not according to the traditional concept. For example, jesus will not look very gentlemanly, very noble, for many reasons. The first traditional idea about nobility is that it has to be from birth -- he is a son of a carpenter, poor carpenter, and that too is not the whole truth. he is the son of the Holy Ghost! Now who is this fellow, Holy Ghost?\nMust have been some playboy around. poor Joseph is deceived!\nNow the virgin birth cannot make anybody noble. Christians have tried hard to prove that he is god's son and the only begotten son. They have been creating much fuss about it for two thousand years and they have been even trying to prove that he belongs to the royal family of David -- that is all nonsense!\nThis poor Joseph, a carpenter, has nothing to do with David. Moreover, he is not a legitimate child. So the first idea of a noble man, of an aristocrat, of an earle is not there. He does not fulfil the first requirement and he does not fulfil other requirements either, because his way of behaving is outrageous.\nWith a whip in his hand he drove out all the moneychangers from the temple -- must have created chaos there! Now this is not a gentlemanly way of behaving. But I can see his nobleness still! It is really a noble act to throw the moneychangers out of the temple, forcibly, because the temple was not meant for these moneychangers; the temple was meant for something totally different, for something beyond, for something transcendental -- for god!\nIt is a noble act, but a noble act which will not fit with the ordinary idea of nobility.\nMeditation brings nobility to you, but it will be so new, unique, that it is not going to fit with any idea. it gives tremendous grace, but that grace will have its own unique expression. It will not be traditional. Even you will be surprised, even you will be in a awe -- what is happening? Even your own idea of nobility will be shattered into thousand pieces, because when real nobility happens it is always rebellious, always outrageous. It hit s hard on all that is nonsensical, superstitious.\nReal nobility is not to belong to the creed but to belong to the whole. Real nobility is not to be part of the mob psychology but to be an individual. The word 'individual' is beautiful. it means indivisible, to be one place, collected, together, integrated -- and this miracle happens through meditation.\nMeditation is a new birth and I call a person noble only if he has attained it, his birth, the second birth, through meditation.\nGautam Buddha loved the word 'noble' very much, so much so that he used to call his way the way of the noble man, the way of the Arya. He called the\nultimate truth also the Aryasatya, the noble truth.\nHis concept of Arya or noble is born out of meditation. Whosoever came to him and became a meditator became an Arya, a noble man. He may have been born to beggar parents, he may have been born to an emperor -- it makes no difference. The second birth is decisive and the second birth has nothing to do with the first birth. The second birth you have to give to yourself. The second birth is psychological; the first birth is physiological -- only your body is born out of your mother's womb. Your father and mother create your physical body you come out of the physical womb of the mother -- that is first birth.\nThe second birth will be -- and only you can do it, nobody else can do it on your behalf -- the second birth will be when you come out of your psychological womb, out of your mind. And that's what meditation is: a state of no-mind.\nSwami Dhyan Sampuro. Dhyan means meditation, Sampuro means perfect.\nMeditation makes one perfect -- not a perfectionist, remember. A perfectionist is a neurotic.\nMeditation makes you perfect, but not a perfectionist. Perfection comes just like a shadow to meditation: you need not bother about it, you need not care about it. it is simply there, it will follow you.\nThe perfectionist has an idea of a goal ahead of him and the meditator has no idea of perfection; perfection follows him from the beyond like a shadow. That is the difference between a perfectionist and a perfect man.\nPerfection is behind the perfect man and ahead of the perfectionist. Because it is ahead it drives him 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnuts. he is trying to become it, he is sacrificing his present for the future and once you become accustomed of sacrificing your present for the future your whole life will be rained; not only this but your future lives will be ruined.\nUnless some enlightened master really hits hard on your head and breaks your skull there is no other hope. And a real sledgehammer will be needed! It cannot be done by the goldsmith's hammer. That small hammer won't effect; people have grown thick skulls. people are really thick and dense, they have grown shock absorbers.\nThe perfectionist goes on sacrificing every moment for the future and that he will be doing in the future too, because future never comes -- that which comes is always present -- and he becomes addicted in sacrificing it.\nMeditation has nothing to do with perfectionism, but perfection comes as a by- product. As you become silent it follows you, wherever you go it is there -- and it is not something dead, hanging around you. It is growing. That is the most miraculous thing about it, because we always think of perfection as the dead end.\nWhat more there can be?\nLogically it seems right that perfection means the full-stop. It is not so. Existentially perfection is also a growing phenomenon, from perfection to more perfection to more perfection -- there is no end to it.\nBecome a meditator and see the miracle happening. Many miracles happen through meditation. It is the magic key. One of the greatest miracles is that it brings perfection for which you were not even thinking, for which you had no desire. you were not asking, you were not searching; it simply comes as a reward from the whole.\nSwami Dhyan Asango. Dhyan means meditation, Asango means one who knows that one is alone and not only knows that one is alone, but is tremendously happy, tremendously blissful about one's aloneness.\nIt is only through meditation that this alchemical change happens: loneliness becomes aloneness, solitariness becomes solitude. Loneliness is ugly, it is misery, it is a hankering for the other. It is like a wound which needs to be healed.\nAloneness is a tremendous joy. One is overflowing with his, one's own being, one needs nobody, one is enough unto oneself. That does not mean that one escapes to the mountains -- why one should escape to the mountains? Wherever one is, one is blissful. And bliss has an intrinsic quality, that is overflows, it\nreaches to others. It is like fragrance of the flowers: it rises in the winds towards the stars, it seeks and searches the others, whosoever is available. The blissful person shares his bliss with the other.\nThe other may be a tree, an animal, a man, a woman, a mountain, a river -- it makes no difference. There may be nobody, the person may be just sitting silently, alone, but he goes on radiating his blissfulness.\nThat is the meaning of Asango: one who has come from loneliness to aloneness, from solitariness to solitude, one who has known one's beauty and one who enjoys to be with oneself.\nMeditation makes it possible. Meditation is really the discovery of your aloneness and its beauty, and its eternity. Then you can be in the crowd but you are alone, you can be in love but you are alone. But it is no more a problem, in fact it is freedom, because when you feel lonely you have to be dependent on somebody who helps you to forget your loneliness.\nAnd remember one fundamental law of life: one can never forgive a person if one has to be dependent on the person. The person you depend upon is unforgivable, because he is the cause of your bondage.\nOnly meditation makes it possible that you can forgive all; in fact there is no question of forgiving because you are not more dependent.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>Ma Dhyan Leslie. Dhyan means meditation, Leslie means calm
spirit.</p><p>Man has tried many ways to be calm, quiet, but all other efforts
except meditation have failed, because all other efforts are basically
of cultivation, of practice. One can cultivate a certain calmness, one
can make it a discipline of life, but it will be only superficial.
Behind the thin layer of calmness there will always be turmoil and any
small accident, any small scratch on the surface and you will erupt like
a volcano.</p><p>In fact the people who murder, the people who commit suicide are the
people who are normally very calm. The people who are normally easily
angered never commit murder, never commit suicide, for the simple reason
because they never</p><p>accumulate so much anger. They go on throwing their anger every day,
they flush it out of their system. But the people who try to be calm,
repress, and the repressed remains alive, not only alive, in it becomes
more and more powerful as time passes by, because you are repressing
every day. it goes on piling up within and there is a limit to
everything. One day the balloon is bound to burst.</p><p>But meditation works in a totally different way: it is not
cultivation, it is not a discipline from the outside, it has nothing to
do directly with calmness, silence, equilibrium. On the contrary,
meditation works in a totally different dimension, the dimension of
awareness. One simply becomes more and more aware of one's acts,
thoughts, feelings. As this awareness deepens, as a by-product calmness
of spirit comes on its own accord. Then it comes from your innermost
core.</p><p>The cultivated calmness remains on the circumference, the calmness
that comes as a consequence of meditation grows from the centre and
spreads towards the circumference; hence there is never any hypocrisy,
never any split, never a schizophrenic state. You are not divided in
two: the surface is one and your reality is just the opposite of it.
Humanity has suffered too much from that cultivated calmness.</p><p>It is time that we should get rid of all the methods of cultivation
and we should go for a direct approach, we should go to the very root of
the matter and the root is in the centre, not on the circumference. on
the circumference only flowers show. And if you want real flowers then
you have to nourish the roots, you have to water the roots, you have to
take care of the roots -- that's what meditation does -- and then roses
come on the surface.</p><p>If you don't work on the roots, in the centre, if you don't get
centred through meditation and grounded, then at the most that you can
do is, you can buy plastic flowers and arrange them around your
circumference. But that is missing the whole opportunity of life.</p><p>Life is an opportunity to grow your centre, your potential, your very
being, because only your being in its total flowering is god. There is
no other god.</p><p>How long you will be here?</p><p>(Probably about two months this time) Two?</p><p>(About two months I think this time) You will be here?</p><p>Yes</p><p>And then come back again for a longer period. I will need you here.
Good. Swami Dhyan simon. Dhyan means meditation, Simon means gracious
being.</p><p>Jesus says again and again 'If you have ears then hear, if you have
eyes then see.' Certainly he was not talking to deaf and to the blinds;
he was talking to ordinary people just like you and everybody else. They
had ears and they had eyes. Then what he means by having ears and by
having eyes? He means a totally different way of seeing and hearing.</p><p>One can hear in three ways. Either in a very indifferent attitude, as
if one cannot care less -- that is ungracious hearing, that is not the
way to commune with a Jesus or a Buddha, that is not the way to be in
the presence of a master. That is not the way of a disciple.</p><p>The second way of hearing is antagonistic hearing. You are already
full of prejudices, you have already concluded that what is right and
what is not, not knowing at all what is right and what is wrong you have
accepted certain assumptions given by others, by the society which has
brought you up, by the education, by 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>your parents, by the church, certain a priori beliefs. Clinging to
those beliefs one can hear but that is again ungracious hearing, because
you are not hearing, you are fighting.| It is better than the first --
indifferent hearing -- because it is impossible to change any person who
is indifferent.</p><p>It is possible to change the second person; even if though he is
antagonistic, he is getting a certain negative kind of relationship. He
is becoming an enemy and an</p><p>enemy can be made a friend.</p><p>The indifferent is unapproachable. he is not even an enemy -- how can
you expect him to be a friend?</p><p>He is not even ready to hate you -- how can he love you? That is the
impossible case.</p><p>But the second can be converted, but it will take unnecessarily long
time, because the fight will destroy the energy. And even if sometimes
he comes to acceptance it will be very reluctantly and he will always go
on watching for some flaw so that he can again go back to his old
pattern. He will be always wavering. He will be not really surrendered.
Even if he comes to surrender his surrender will be with strings
attached to it.</p><p>He can withdraw any moment.</p><p>A real master never takes any note of the first. he simply drops the
idea of the first category. he takes a little bit notice of the second
category but only for a short time, just to see whether it is possible
or the case is too time-absorbing, too much unnecessary hassle -- then
he drops the second also.</p><p>He accepts only the third -- the gracious person -- who can hear,
simply hear, without any prejudice for or against. Remember,
gracious-hearing does not mean what Christians and Hindus and
Mohammedans have been telling to people. They are telling wrong things;
they are telling gracious-hearing means hearing as a believer. That is
not gracious.</p><p>Whether you believe or disbelieve you have already taken a
standpoint, you are already prejudiced, you have already got a certain
mind and with the mind there is no grace.</p><p>Gracious hearing is with meditation, with no-mind. You don't have any
prejudice, for or against. You are non-judgemental. You are simply
available, open, vulnerable. You have not decided anything; you are just
an enquirer. Then the hearing has tremendous grace.</p><p>And truth has one intrinsic quality: if you hear it with unprejudiced
consciousness it immediately reaches to your heart, it immediately
triggers a process of transformation in you. An immediate contact with
the master becomes</p><p>possible if one can hear without any belief, disbelief, without any
idea of what truth is, if one can hear just like a child, from a state
of not-knowing. that state is meditation and it is only through
meditation that the master becomes available, the truth becomes
available, and ultimately, everything that is of value happens through
it.</p><p>I say to you that if you hear silently without any prejudice you will
immediately know what is true.</p><p>Another thing has to be also added: you will also immediately know
without any thought process what is not true. Truth is self-evident, it
needs no proof. And because truth is self-evident, untruth is also
self-evident.</p><p>All that is needed on your part is to be <em>totally</em> available
and immediately you will know what is truth and what is not. And to know
what is truth liberates! It is deliverance. It brings to your life the
ultimate joy, the ultimate flowering, the ultimate fragrance of
existence.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Sylvie. Dhyan means meditation. Sylvie comes from Sylvanus.
Sylvanus is a mythological god of the woods an the forest. It symbolises
profound solitude. A virgin solitude which prevails in a forest where
nobody has gone. It is a beautiful name.</p><p>Meditation takes you to your inner woods, inner forest, where nobody
has ever gone. Only you can go and you have not gone yet. It is not
possible for anybody else to go to your innermost core; it is absolutely
private, categorically private. That is the only place which is private,
everything else can be shared.</p><p>Sooner or later there will be ways to reach people's minds,
mechanically. If it is possible to make a cardiogram it is not very far
that it will be possible to read the mind waves, just like a cardiogram.
You have to be attached to a machine and the machine immediately will
start screening. Much will be just doodling because inside much is
doodling but once in a while something relevant will turn up. Ninety per
cent will be rubbish, but mind too cannot remain for long private.</p><p>There is only one place in you which will always remain private, and
that which is intrinsically private is yours. Everything else belongs to
the public. Even your mind belongs to the public because it is created
by your parents, the priests, the politicians. Even your conscience
belongs to the public because they have created it. What is wrong, what
is not to be done, what should be done, all the</p><p>commandments, the idea of sin an virtue -- it is created by others.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>My concern is to help you to discover your innermost solitude, the
profound silence that prevails at the very centre of your being -- the
centre of the cyclone.</p><p>Only then one knows what life is all about. Only then one knows the
meaning, the significance, only then one knows the beauty, the truth,
only then one knows all that is worth knowing.</p><p>Meditation is a passage from the circumference. it is a bridge. Its
another name is awareness. Learn to be aware.</p><p>As your awareness becomes more and more clear, more and more sharp,
you will become aware that you are coming closer and closer to a place
where immense silence has prevailed for eternity. That is the real
temple of god. All other temples are man's creations and all other gods
are creations of man in his own image. If one wants to discover the true
god, then one has to go within oneself.</p><p>Your <em>own</em> original face is the face of the true god.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Elisabeth. Dhyan means meditation, Elisabeth means
consecrated to god, surrendered to god, totally devoted to god.</p><p>One cannot be surrendered to god just by believing in a certain god
-- Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan. how can one be surrendered to a
belief. Deep down, hidden behind the belief there is always doubt. They
exist together, they are two sides of the same coin. On one side it is
belief, on the other side it is doubt. In fact the belief is needed only
to repress doubt. if there is no doubt there is no need for belief at
all.</p><p>So all believers are bogus, all believers are phony they are simply
repressing</p><p>their doubt by making a great system of belief to repress it,
creating a big structure of believe, repeating the Bible every day or
the Gita or the Koran, chanting mantras of the Vedas and just making
much fuss, creating much smoke so they can forget that there is doubt
inside them. And the worm of the doubt goes on and on working and
working inside, it goes on eating their very heart. And they go on
befooling themselves and others by superficial beliefs.</p><p>I don't teach belief because belief can never become a surrender. It
is only love that becomes surrender.</p><p>And love is not a question of belief, because love is not of the mind
at all. Love is a question of experience.</p><p>In religious terms love can be called trust. That is the same word;
there is no difference between love and trust. Love is always trusting,
trust is always loving. That is only a religious way of saying that it
is love that makes surrender possible. But how love will happen if you
have not seen god? How can you love a god that you have not seen, that
you have not heard, that you have not experienced not even in your
dreams, not even a far away echo? -- it is impossible. It is asking for
something superhuman from poor human beings; asking something so
illogical, simply creates trouble for them. They are already in much
trouble and religions create even more troubles for them.</p><p>That's why you will see religious people much more in anxiety than
the so-called irreligious. You will find religious people much more sad
and miserable than the so-called irreligious. The irreligious laugh too,
dance too, sing too; the religious has no time. He is so guilt-ridden,
so much worried, because what he wants to do he cannot do. Even a man
like Saint Augustine says in his CONFESSIONS, 'God help me, because what
I do is that which should not be done and what I do not do is that which
should be done, and I have tried my best, but it seems impossible for me
-- unless <em>you</em> help me I will not be able to make it.'</p><p>If this is the situation of Augustine, a so-called great Christian
saint, then what about the poor Christians, how they can make it? When
they cannot make it, when they fall short, they feel guilty, they feel
that they are sinners. And the whole problem is absolutely unnecessary.
it is fabricated by our stupidity; hence I wan you to be-pass all this
nonsense.</p><p>The simple thing, the simplest is to be silent, to be aware, to be
watchful, forget</p><p>all about beliefs and religions and dogmas and philosophies and
ideologies; just become silent, aware. And you will be surprised: in
those moments of awareness and silence you start having glimpses of the
divine. And those glimpses make it possible -- not that you have
<em>to</em> surrender, the surrender happens, just as you fall in love.
Not that you have to fall in love with somebody -- it is not a question
of doing something.</p><p>If you are ordered that 'Elisabeth, go and fall in love with this
man,' what you will do? You will be at a loss. How one can fall in love?
One can pretend, one can act but one cannot fall in love and deep down
one will know that it is all false, pseudo. And people have been told to
fall in love with god, whom they have never seen, whom they don't know
whether he exists at all. They have no idea about god or godliness. They
are not even aware of their own selves, what they can say about god? And
these poor human beings are tortured by the priests, continuously
sermonised, 'Surrender to god and surrender totally and surrender

happening and then you have to fall. Not that you have to do something,
it simply happens. it is a happening. And when it happens on its own
accord it has a tremendous beauty to it.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Earle. Dhyan means meditation, Earle means a noble man,
nobleness, nobility.</p><p>Meditation certainly brings great nobility but not according to the
ideas of people, not according to the traditional concept. For example,
jesus will not look very gentlemanly, very noble, for many reasons. The
first traditional idea about nobility is that it has to be from birth --
he is a son of a carpenter, poor carpenter, and that too is not the
whole truth. he is the son of the Holy Ghost! Now who is this fellow,
Holy Ghost?</p><p>Must have been some playboy around. poor Joseph is deceived!</p><p>Now the virgin birth cannot make anybody noble. Christians have tried
hard to prove that he is god's son and the only begotten son. They have
been creating much fuss about it for two thousand years and they have
been even trying to prove that he belongs to the royal family of David
-- that is all nonsense!</p><p>This poor Joseph, a carpenter, has nothing to do with David.
Moreover, he is not a legitimate child. So the first idea of a noble
man, of an aristocrat, of an earle is not there. He does not fulfil the
first requirement and he does not fulfil other requirements either,
because his way of behaving is outrageous.</p><p>With a whip in his hand he drove out all the moneychangers from the
temple -- must have created chaos there! Now this is not a gentlemanly
way of behaving. But I can see his nobleness still! It is really a noble
act to throw the moneychangers out of the temple, forcibly, because the
temple was not meant for these moneychangers; the temple was meant for
something totally different, for something beyond, for something
transcendental -- for god!</p><p>It is a noble act, but a noble act which will not fit with the
ordinary idea of nobility.</p><p>Meditation brings nobility to you, but it will be so new, unique,
that it is not going to fit with any idea. it gives tremendous grace,
but that grace will have its own unique expression. It will not be
traditional. Even <em>you</em> will be surprised, even <em>you</em> will
be in a awe -- what is happening? Even your own idea of nobility will be
shattered into thousand pieces, because when real nobility happens it is
always rebellious, always outrageous. It hit s hard on all that is
nonsensical, superstitious.</p><p>Real nobility is not to belong to the creed but to belong to the
whole. Real nobility is not to be part of the mob psychology but to be
an individual. The word 'individual' is beautiful. it means indivisible,
to be one place, collected, together, integrated -- and this miracle
happens through meditation.</p><p>Meditation is a new birth and I call a person noble only if he has
attained it, his birth, the second birth, through meditation.</p><p>Gautam Buddha loved the word 'noble' very much, so much so that he
used to call his way the way of the noble man, the way of the Arya. He
called the</p><p>ultimate truth also the Aryasatya, the noble truth.</p><p>His concept of Arya or noble is born out of meditation. Whosoever
came to him and became a meditator became an Arya, a noble man. He may
have been born to beggar parents, he may have been born to an emperor --
it makes no difference. The second birth is decisive and the second
birth has nothing to do with the first birth. The second birth you have
to give to yourself. The second birth is psychological; the first birth
is physiological -- only your body is born out of your mother's womb.
Your father and mother create your physical body you come out of the
physical womb of the mother -- that is first birth.</p><p>The second birth will be -- and only you can do it, nobody else can
do it on your behalf -- the second birth will be when you come out of
your psychological womb, out of your mind. And that's what meditation
is: a state of no-mind.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Sampuro. Dhyan means meditation, Sampuro means
perfect.</p><p>Meditation makes one perfect -- not a perfectionist, remember. A
perfectionist is a neurotic.</p><p>Meditation makes you perfect, but not a perfectionist. Perfection
comes just like a shadow to meditation: you need not bother about it,
you need not care about it. it is simply there, it will follow you.</p><p>The perfectionist has an idea of a goal ahead of him and the
meditator has no idea of perfection; perfection follows him from the
beyond like a shadow. That is the difference between a perfectionist and
a perfect man.</p><p>Perfection is behind the perfect man and ahead of the perfectionist.
Because it is ahead it drives him 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

the future and once you become accustomed of sacrificing your present
for the future your whole life will be rained; not only this but your
future lives will be ruined.</p><p>Unless some enlightened master really hits hard on your head and
breaks your skull there is no other hope. And a real sledgehammer will
be needed! It cannot be done by the goldsmith's hammer. That small
hammer won't effect; people have grown thick skulls. people are really
thick and dense, they have grown shock absorbers.</p><p>The perfectionist goes on sacrificing every moment for the future and
that he will be doing in the future too, because future never comes --
that which comes is always present -- and he becomes addicted in
sacrificing it.</p><p>Meditation has nothing to do with perfectionism, but perfection comes
<em>as</em> a by- product. As you become silent it follows you, wherever
you go it is there -- and it is not something dead, hanging around you.
It is growing. That is the most miraculous thing about it, because we
always think of perfection as the dead end.</p><p>What more there can be?</p><p>Logically it seems right that perfection means the full-stop. It is
not so. Existentially perfection is also a growing phenomenon, from
perfection to more perfection to more perfection -- there is no end to
it.</p><p>Become a meditator and see the miracle happening. Many miracles
happen through meditation. It is the magic key. One of the greatest
miracles is that it brings perfection for which you were not even
thinking, for which you had no desire. you were not asking, you were not
searching; it simply comes as a reward from the whole.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Asango. Dhyan means meditation, Asango means one who
knows that one is alone and not only knows that one is alone, but is
tremendously happy, tremendously blissful about one's aloneness.</p><p>It is only through meditation that this alchemical change happens:
loneliness becomes aloneness, solitariness becomes solitude. Loneliness
is ugly, it is misery, it is a hankering for the other. It is like a
wound which needs to be healed.</p><p>Aloneness is a tremendous joy. One is overflowing with his, one's own
being, one needs nobody, one is enough unto oneself. That does not mean
that one escapes to the mountains -- why one should escape to the
mountains? Wherever one is, one is blissful. And bliss has an intrinsic
quality, that is overflows, it</p><p>reaches to others. It is like fragrance of the flowers: it rises in
the winds towards the stars, it seeks and searches the others, whosoever
is available. The blissful person shares his bliss with the other.</p><p>The other may be a tree, an animal, a man, a woman, a mountain, a
river -- it makes no difference. There may be nobody, the person may be
just sitting silently, alone, but he goes on radiating his
blissfulness.</p><p>That is the meaning of Asango: one who has come from loneliness to
aloneness, from solitariness to solitude, one who has known one's beauty
and one who enjoys to be with oneself.</p><p>Meditation makes it possible. Meditation is really the discovery of
your aloneness and its beauty, and its eternity. Then you can be in the
crowd but you are alone, you can be in love but you are alone. But it is
no more a problem, in fact it is freedom, because when you feel lonely
you have to be dependent on somebody who helps you to forget your
loneliness.</p><p>And remember one fundamental law of life: one can never forgive a
person if one has to be dependent on the person. The person you depend
upon is unforgivable, because he is the cause of your bondage.</p><p>Only meditation makes it possible that you can forgive all; in fact
there is no question of forgiving because you are not more dependent.
You are absolutely independent. You are <em>as</em> blissful alone as
you are in togetherness. There is no difference at all. You rejoice
<em>each</em> moment, whatsoever it is: in the marketplace, in the
mountains, with people or alone, it remains a constant phenomenon in

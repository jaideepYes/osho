It is for reference purposes only.]\nSwami Dhyan Leo. Dhyan means meditation, Leo means a lion.\nGautam the Buddha exactly has said that meditation is the lion's roar, because it is an explosion like atomic explosion. It is the explosion of your consciousness which is far more deeper, far more vaster, than any atomic explosion can ever be.\nYes, there is a difference between these two explosions. The atomic explosion is destructive. We have yet to find a creative use for it, but the explosion that happens in consciousness through meditation is inevitably creative. There is no possible way to use it in a destructive direction.\nThe atomic explosion sooner of later will be used for creativity but the basic\nrequirement for that use will be if many many people, particularly the scientists who are involved, become meditators. Only than the experience of meditation will bring creativity to their destructive energy that they have unconsciously released in the world.\nIt is a lion's roar because the moment a man knows the deepest experience of his being -- that's what meditation is all about -- he becomes fearless, because he knows there is no death any more; he was never born and he will never die -- he is eternal. It is a lion's roar because now nobody can enslave you. Yes, you can kill him but you cannot enslave him. And when you are killing him you are killing only the outer shell of his being, not his soul. You can imprison his body but not his being; now he knows freedom and a freedom that cannot be taken away. It releases immense courage. He can fight with the whole world. In fact all the great meditators have been fighting this stupid world, all alone, single- handedly. Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir -- down the ages the meditator has stood there fighting the collective stupidity of humanity. he has been butchered, crucified, killed, poisoned, but that makes no difference.\nWhenever a man again attains to meditation, the lion's roar again explodes. Again there is one real, authentic human being, who is ready to sacrifice everything for truth.\nMa Dhyan Radhay. Dhyan means meditation, Radhay is a form of Radha.\nMythologically the story is that Radha was the most devoted disciple and lover of Krishna. Her devotion was so total that she never said anything about it, because to say anything about something which is total disfigures it.\nWords are very inadequate. They can contain small things but not things like love, things like awareness, things like blessings, blissfulness, ecstasy. We have these words but they don't convey the reality of the experience.\nShe remained silent but she followed Krishna like a shadow; so silent she was that these are the actual words used in the scriptures 'She followed Krishna like a shadow, not making any noise.' The shadow follows you without making any declaration about itself, without in any way interfering with you, interrupting your work. It simply remains there.\nIf you go to the North it goes to the North if you go to the South it goes to the South. It does not even say that 'This is inconsistent. Just now you were going to\nthe North and now you start going to the South -- why?' Even there is no why.\nThe surrender is so total that in the old scriptures even her name is not mentioned only this is said 'A woman was in immense love with Krishna, who followed him like a shadow,' because to give her any name 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwill not be right.\nThere are experiences which are beyond name, beyond form; hence Radha or Radhay -- Radhay is only a loving way of calling Radha. It makes it more round, more loving, more intimate.\nThe name was given after thousands of years and the name was also given with a tremendous significance. In Sanskrit Dhara means the river that moves from the mountains, high above from the Himalayan peaks, and then goes towards the ocean. This is called Dhara; Dhara is exactly the opposite of Radha. If you read Dhara from backwards it becomes Radha. So Radha is a symbolic name. It simply means the river has started moving upstream, the miracle has happened, that the river is not going towards the ocean but is going towards the source, that it is rising high towards the peaks.\nIn all the languages of the world we use the expression 'falling in love' because our love is like Dhara: it falls from the peaks of the mountains, than comes to the valleys, then to the plains and then ultimately to the lowest place, the ocean.\nWater seeks the lowest place. The man who is trying to find god, truth, is not really trying to find the goal of life; he is in fact trying to find the source of life because the source and the goal are one.\nIf you cannot find the source, from where you have come, you can never find the goal, to where you are going, because life is a circle; we go to the same source from where we have come. it is easier to find the source than to find the goal. By\nfinding the source one finds the goal and there is a quality of love which cannot be implied by our phrase 'falling in love'. For that quality of love we have to invent a totally different phraseology, 'rising in love', and that's what happens between the disciple and the master, rising in love --\nand that is the meaning of Radhay.\nMeditation helps you to turn the whole tide. It changes the very direction of life. It changes the very law of life. Instead of reaching to the lowest you start reaching to the highest.\nSwami Dhyan Vestrohi. Dhyan means meditation, Vestrohi means a rebel.\nMeditation brings many flowers to life, it opens up many dimensions which were closed before. It makes you aware of many aspects of your own being of which you were never aware, not even in your dreams. And the most important aspect is that it releases your rebellious energy, it makes you a rebellious spirit. And only the rebel knows what life is; the orthodox never knows it, the conformist cannot know it.\nHe knows only the trodden path of the crowd, of the mob.\nAnd the mob is subhuman, the mob psychology is not yet human, what to say about superhuman? It is a far-away distant goal, just a fantasy as far as mob psychology is concerned. Sometimes it is lower than the animal psychology but it always remains subhuman and is always ready to fall from even that subhuman state towards animal.\nIt happens every day; in war you see it happening, in riots you see it happening. Mohammedans and Christians have been fighting and killing each other, Mohammedans and Hindus have been fighting and killing each other, Hindus and Buddhist and so on, so forth. Even the so-called religious mobs never become human: they remain subhuman, and just a small excuse and they even fall from there. Then they can do anything -- they can burn people alive, they have burned. And the people who burned people alive were not bad people. They were priests, popes, imams, very respectable, knowledgeable.\nThe people who crucified Jesus were not bad people. They were the greatest rabbis of the Jews. As far as their ordinary day-to-day life was concerned they were respectable citizens, but what happened? Why they crucified Jesus? Why\nso many people have been burned by the churches, alive, and with no shame, with no guilt? -- -because it is being done in the name of god, it is being done in the name of love, it is being done in the name of the truth, in the name of religion.\nThe mob psychology remains animalistic hidden behind a garbage of so-called religious jargon.\nTo become part of it is ugly. It is a betrayal to your own self. It is suicidal. To be part of a mob psychology simply means you have committed a spiritual suicide, you are no more an individual. You have lost your intelligence.\nI have observed it, I have asked people, because I have been witness to many things. Hindus burning a Mohammedan mosque, and I watched the whole process and the people who were burning were respectable people. Nobody could have ever thought that these people can burn, destroy. Than I asked them individually, later on, 'Could you have done it alone?', and they immediately said 'No. Even to think of doing such a thing alone is not possible. We cannot imagine ourselves doing it. We did it because everybody was doing it. We were just part of it, we are not responsible'.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI have seen Mohammedans killing HIndus and I have asked them, 'Can you do it individually?' And they have said 'No, we can do it only when we are part of a mob, when we are no more separate from the mob --\nthen there is no responsibility, then it is being already done. Whether we participate or not makes no difference.'\nMeditation brings you out of the mob psychology. First it makes you human and then it takes you towards the superhuman, which is divine in other words, but it is rebellion; hence the crowd has never been able to forgive meditators and it will never be able.\nI am not a pessimist; I am immensely optimist, for the simple reason because I see humanity growing, coming of age, but this is a fact -- even optimism cannot hide it -- that the mob psychology will never be able to rise to the levels of individual psychology. It may become a little better, but the difference between the individual and the crowd will remain constantly the same.\nWhen the crowd psychology will go a little higher, the individual rebellion will also go a little higher.\nThe distance will remain the same. And it is really a joy to rebel against all that is rotten, ugly, against all that is dead, stinking. It is a joy, it is a challenge, and it is a great opportunity to grow. Only individuals can grow into godliness. And I insist and emphasise that only individuals can be religious; religion can never be a cult, a creed, a church. The moment it becomes a church, cult, creed, it is not religion at all. it is just camouflaged politics.\nMa Dhyan Agni. Dhyan means meditation, Agni means fire.\nMeditation is a fire. It does two things: it burns your past totally, it consumes your mind absolutely without even leaving a trace behind it, and your past contains everything -- your religion, your politics, your nationality, your race, and all that. It contains all that is wrong. It is just junk which we have been loaded by others.\nThe fire of meditation consumes it totally and the moment it has consumed all that is not part of you but has been forced upon you, which is just a conditioning but not your being, the moment it is destroyed your being for the first time rises above because it is no more burdened, no more crushed under the weight of the past -- and the weight of the past is big, it is mountainous and your being is just like a rose flower, very delicate.\nThe moment rocks are removed the rose starts growing; hence the fire of meditation does two work.\nOne; it is a death and second, it is a resurrection, a new beginning, a rebirth.\nJesus says to Nicodemus 'Unless you are born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.' That's what exactly meditation does; it destroys you as you are and it resurrects you as you should be.\nSwami Dhyan Dheeren. Dhyan means meditation, Dheeren means the patient one.\nMeditation needs infinite patience. One cannot grow into meditation in a hurry. It can never be like instant coffee. It is not a seasonal flower. It is like the star touching big Cedars of Lebanon: it takes hundreds of years for those trees to rise above into the sky. And they live for thousands of years.\nMeditation is going to give you the whole eternity; hence it cannot be achieved in a hurry; One has to be really patient. And this is one of the qualities modern humanity has completely lost track of, it is one of the contributions of the western mind to the whole world; this hurry, this constant rush.\nThere is a basic reason for it. The Judaic religion and it offshoots -- Christianity and Islam -- these three religions are the root cause of it, because they have been talking about only one life. If this is the only life than naturally one is in a rush.\nJust seventy years, if you are fortunate, and if you calculate you will find that that is not much; one-third of it will be lost in sleep. Much of it will be lost in the schools, colleges, university, reading all kinds of stupid things -- geography, history, geology, zoology and what not!\nMuch of it will be lost in earning bread and butter, much of it will, will be lost by going to the factory or the office from the home and coming back -- almost there are people who are travelling two, three hours every day from the office to the home. The remaining little bit will be lost in seeing that idiot box, TV or going to a movie or shaving your beard every day or twice a day, taking bath and eating food and all kinds of things -- if you simply go on calculating it will be a miracle if you can save seven minutes out of seventy years life. Than it is too short: seven minutes between birth and death and all is finished and finished forever! It is bound to create panic -- and that\" what has happened in the West.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd the disease has become now contagious, all over the world. It has never been so in the East because we had a vast canvas, there was no hurry. Thousands of life -- actually India has been talking about eight-hundred-forty-million lives. That created its own trouble; it created lethargy, lousiness. You cannot rely on anybody. He will say 'I will come five o'clock' and he may not turn for seven days and still he will not feel guilty or ashamed. he will say 'What is there? If not that Sunday this Sunday I have come, if not five, then six, then seven -- it doesn't matter much.' All trains are running late...\nA man once asked the station master 'That whenever I come the train is late, than why do you publish the timetable?' The station master said 'We publish the timetable so we can know how much the train is late!\nOtherwise how we will know? It has nothing to do for the train to come in time; it is just to know that how much late it is.'\nEverything is lousy, everything is lazy -- that is a bad implication of it -- but one thing was great in it, that nobody was in a hurry. That helped immensely meditation. It is not an accident that meditation grew in the East. It is inevitable that it could have only grown in the East where people are ready to wait. There is no expectation in waiting; they simply enjoy waiting.\nI know that both the attitudes have their good points and bad points. The West has been able to bring things in order, it has been able to discipline things. Trains are in time, people are efficient, nobody is lazy or lousy-that's good about it -- but then it creates a certain tension inside.\nThe whole life you are running so when somebody says that meditation is just sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself, you listen it but you cannot understand it -- how the grass can grow by itself if you don't pull it up? And just sitting silently? I used to have this darshan in my lawn, I had to change, because people were continuously pulling the grass -- they were destroying the lawn!\nThey were simply trying to help the grass... nothing. How the grass is going to grow by itself? They were in a hurry.\nYou just watch people: they are in a hurry for no reason. Hurry has become their lifestyle.\nI want my sannyasins to understand this very clearly. I don't want them to be lazy and lousy, I don't want them to be in constant hurry and tension and always running, not exactly knowing why.\nTwo old man were talking with each other: 'Do you remember in our young days we used to chase women?' The other said 'Yes, I remember perfectly well. The only thing I don't remember is why we used to chase them'\nNobody exactly knows why you are running and nobody has time to ask you either. Everybody is saying\n'See you soon,' (can't get it??) they are on the way.\nMy sannyasins have to create a synthesis. As far as the outside world is concerned the western attitude is absolutely right; everything should be done as totally, as perfectly as possible, because there may be no other moment to improve upon, and don't leave this world with something incomplete. That will be your signature. Leave this world with something complete, perfected, to your heart's content -- that's perfectly beautiful as far as the outside world is concerned. The western approach is absolutely correct. For the outside existence I would like the whole world to become the West.\nAnd for the inside world I would like the whole world to become the East: there don't be in a hurry, there just sit and don't pull the grass. Just sit silently, wait, let things happen. You watch, you don't be a doer\n-- that watching is meditation, that non-doing is meditation, that waiting is meditation.\nUp to now we have been dividing the world in a geographical way, in East and West, in two hemispheres. I would like to divide in a totally different way: not the earth, not the globe, not geography, but each man,.. his outside is the West, his inside is the East. And each man has to be a total world. When he is working on the outside, work perfectly, efficiently and when you are inside, forget all about the outside world and its methods, than relax. Then just fall into a let-go -- that is the meaning of your name: falling into a deep let-go.\nAnd then it happens -- remember, it happens. It cannot be done. It is a happening!\nHow long you will be here? (at least a year)\nThat's good. This is what I mean by becoming eastern as far as the inner side is concerned. Perfectly good! Help him.\nHelp him. Come her. Good. I have been waiting for YOU ... and finally you have come.\nSwami Dhyan Sakshi. Dhyan means meditation, Sakshi means a witness. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is basically the process of witnessing: looking from your centre all that is happening. Many things are happening on the outside -- the noise of the train far away; something is happening in you body --\nyour knees are hurting -- right? Your mind is churning many thoughts, that 'What am I doing here?' Your heart is feeling many emotions, you have waited for this moment for so long. There is joy in the heart, a certain ecstasy, a mood, a receptivity. All those things have to be watched very minutely. Watching them opens your inner being. Just watching them opens your inner eye and that is the real eye; the outside eyes are of not much use. You are fortunate that you don't have them. You are blessed! Blessed are the blind for they shall not be forced to see this ugly world! And it is really ugly -- believe me!\nAnd you can put your total energy for the inner eye. The outside eyes are wasting eighty percent of energy -- it is the major part. Man has five senses, eighty per cent is taken away by the eyes and only twenty per cent is left for the other four senses. They are very poor people, those four. Eyes are very rich, they have monopolised the whole thing; hence it is good -- eighty per cent energy is saved -- and that can be immediately used for witnessing, for seeing your inner world. hence in the East we call a person who is blind 'pragyanshakshu' -- this\nword is untranslatable. It simply means one who has the inner eye: The outer eyes are not there but that is a great opportunity because eighty per cent of energy is available for the person and he can easily become a meditator, more easily then anybody else.\nIt is a well-known fact that blind people have better ears than anybody else. They become beautiful musicians, good singers, for the simple reason, for their eighty per cent energy is diverted towards the ears.\nEars are the closest to the eyes, so when the eyes are not using the energy the ears start using it.\nBut that is again a misuse because ears will again take it outside. It is better to use this available energy for your observation, inner observation.\nJust watch everything -- and it is good because you have nothing much to do. You have not to go here and there and visit people and become a member of the Rotary Club. You are saved from so much nonsense that I felt really jealous of you! Enjoy it! And feel sorry for everybody else! They are poorer and you can become immensely rich. And the art of that richness is witnessing.\nWitnessing is another name for meditation. How long you will be here?\n(Three weeks)\nThat's good. And when you are coming back again? (In November)\nThat's good. help him. Good!\nMa Dhyan Anutoshi. Dhyan means meditation, Anutoshi means absolutely contented.\nMeditation and contentment are like the flower and its fragrance; meditation is the flower and contentment is its fragrance; hence the people who try to cultivate contentment are starting on a wrong journey. A cultivated contentment is not contentment at all; it is like a spraying perfume on a plastic flower.\nyou can deceive others but how can you deceive yourself? And what is the point of deception? It is dangerous because time is lost, opportunity is lost.\nOne can cultivate contentment, there are millions of people who have cultivated contentment. Seeing that the grapes are too far way they have started consoling themselves that the grapes are sour -- that's what they mean by contentment: seeing that they cannot be rich they start saying 'Poverty is spiritual,' because to be rich one needs guts.\nEverybody is born poor- that is nothing much -- but to be rich it is a very competitive world, it is a cut-throat competition. Everybody is at everybody's throat. The cowards escape but they have also to invent some consolation for themselves. They start saying 'What is there in richness? Gold is nothing but dust and money is for the worldly people; it is not fort the spiritual ones.' They start greeting a new kind of ego. They are other-worldly, spiritual, religious; they are not interested in money, in power. They have renounced it all, as if they had it in the first place.\nThis is a very pseudo state. One has created a subtle wall of consolations around oneself to hide one's wounds.\nAnd people will respect such a person, they will call him a saint. And because people respect and honour and start thinking that he is religious, a very saintly person, holy, the ego feels even more satisfied, more nourished. It becomes just a ego-number -- and how ego can ever be contented? Hence a new 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndiscontent starts\\: how to be more spiritual, how to be more holy, how to be holier then other holier people?\nJust tell any saint that 'some other saint is higher then you.' and immediately you will see where his contentment is gone; immediately he is angry, immediately he is enraged, all his humbleness is lost, all his simplicity gone. It is a new kind of power struggle, a very subtle one; hence I don't tell to my sannyasins that cultivate anything -- contentment, joy, peace, compassion, service, duty --\nnothing should be cultivated.\nEverything cultivated remains phony. The true comes only through meditation.\nFirst become more aware, more alert, more watchful, more observant of life and all its workings, of mind and all its processes, of the heart and all its subtle undercurrents -- of feelings, moods -- become aware of the world and how you react to the world. Just go on becoming more and more like a mirror. To be a mirror is to be meditative. Reflect everything without any judgement, and then a moment comes when all the thoughts disappear, just by watching them -- nothing else is needed. All the feelings disappear, all the moods disappear. One becomes utterly empty, clean, clear, and in that clarity flowers start showering --\nflowers of contentment, of joy, of ecstasy. Then you are not doing anything to bring them. They are coming on their own accord. They come as a gift from the god.

diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>Swami Dhyan Leo. Dhyan means meditation, Leo means a lion.</p><p>Gautam the Buddha exactly has said that meditation is the lion's
roar, because it is an explosion like atomic explosion. It is the
explosion of your consciousness which is far more deeper, far more
vaster, than any atomic explosion can ever be.</p><p>Yes, there is a difference between these two explosions. The atomic
explosion is destructive. We have yet to find a creative use for it, but
the explosion that happens in consciousness through meditation is
inevitably creative. There is no possible way to use it in a destructive
direction.</p><p>The atomic explosion sooner of later will be used for creativity but
the basic</p><p>requirement for that use will be if many many people, particularly
the scientists who are involved, become meditators. Only than the
experience of meditation will bring creativity to their destructive
energy that they have unconsciously released in the world.</p><p>It is a lion's roar because the moment a man knows the deepest
experience of his being -- that's what meditation is all about -- he
becomes fearless, because he knows there is no death any more; he was
never born and he will never die -- he is eternal. It is a lion's roar
because now nobody can enslave you. Yes, you can kill him but you cannot
enslave him. And when you are killing him you are killing only the outer
shell of his being, not his soul. You can imprison his body but not his
being; now he knows freedom and a freedom that cannot be taken away. It
releases immense courage. He can fight with the whole world. In fact all
the great meditators have been fighting this stupid world, all alone,
single- handedly. Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir -- down the ages the
meditator has stood there fighting the collective stupidity of humanity.
he has been butchered, crucified, killed, poisoned, but that makes no
difference.</p><p>Whenever a man again attains to meditation, the lion's roar again
explodes. Again there is one <em>real</em>, authentic human being, who
is ready to sacrifice everything for truth.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Radhay. Dhyan means meditation, Radhay is a form of
Radha.</p><p>Mythologically the story is that Radha was the most devoted disciple
and lover of Krishna. Her devotion was so total that she never said
anything about it, because to say anything about something which is
total disfigures it.</p><p>Words are very inadequate. They can contain small things but not
things like love, things like awareness, things like blessings,
blissfulness, ecstasy. We <em>have</em> these words but they don't
convey the reality of the experience.</p><p>She remained silent but she followed Krishna like a shadow; so silent
she was that these are the actual words used in the scriptures 'She
followed Krishna like a shadow, not making any noise.' The shadow
follows you without making any declaration about itself, without in any
way interfering with you, interrupting your work. It simply remains
there.</p><p>If you go to the North it goes to the North if you go to the South it
goes to the South. It does not even say that 'This is inconsistent. Just
now you were going to</p><p>the North and now you start going to the South -- why?' Even there is
no why.</p><p>The surrender is so total that in the old scriptures even her name is
not mentioned only this is said 'A woman was in immense love with
Krishna, who followed him like a shadow,' because to give her any name

or Radhay -- Radhay is only a loving way of calling Radha. It makes it
more round, more loving, more intimate.</p><p>The name was given after thousands of years and the name was also
given with a tremendous significance. In Sanskrit Dhara means the river
that moves from the mountains, high above from the Himalayan peaks, and
then goes towards the ocean. This is called Dhara; Dhara is exactly the
opposite of Radha. If you read Dhara from backwards it becomes Radha. So
Radha is a symbolic name. It simply means the river has started moving
upstream, the miracle has happened, that the river is not going towards
the ocean but is going towards the source, that it is rising high
towards the peaks.</p><p>In all the languages of the world we use the expression 'falling in
love' because our love is like Dhara: it falls from the peaks of the
mountains, than comes to the valleys, then to the plains and then
ultimately to the lowest place, the ocean.</p><p>Water seeks the lowest place. The man who is trying to find god,
truth, is not really trying to find the goal of life; he is in fact
trying to find the source of life because the source and the goal are
one.</p><p>If you cannot find the source, from where you have come, you can
never find the goal, to where you are going, because life is a circle;
we go to the same source from where we have come. it is easier to find
the source than to find the goal. By</p><p>finding the source one finds the goal and there is a quality of love
which cannot be implied by our phrase 'falling in love'. For that
quality of love we have to invent a totally different phraseology,
'rising in love', and that's what happens between the disciple and the
master, rising in love --</p><p>and that is the meaning of Radhay.</p><p>Meditation helps you to turn the whole tide. It changes the very
direction of life. It changes the very law of life. Instead of reaching
to the lowest you start reaching to the highest.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Vestrohi. Dhyan means meditation, Vestrohi means a
rebel.</p><p>Meditation brings many flowers to life, it opens up many dimensions
which were closed before. It makes you aware of many aspects of your own
being of which you were <em>never</em> aware, not even in your dreams.
And the most important aspect is that it releases your rebellious
energy, it makes you a rebellious spirit. And only the rebel knows what
life is; the orthodox never knows it, the conformist cannot know it.</p><p>He knows only the trodden path of the crowd, of the mob.</p><p>And the mob is subhuman, the mob psychology is not yet human, what to
say about superhuman? It is a far-away distant goal, just a fantasy as
far as mob psychology is concerned. Sometimes it is lower than the
animal psychology but it always remains subhuman and is always ready to
fall from even that subhuman state towards animal.</p><p>It happens every day; in war you see it happening, in riots you see
it happening. Mohammedans and Christians have been fighting and killing
each other, Mohammedans and Hindus have been fighting and killing each
other, Hindus and Buddhist and so on, so forth. Even the so-called
religious mobs never become human: they remain subhuman, and just a
small excuse and they even fall from there. Then they can do anything --
they can burn people alive, they <em>have</em> burned. And the people
who burned people alive were not bad people. They were priests, popes,
imams, very respectable, knowledgeable.</p><p>The people who crucified Jesus were not bad people. They were the
greatest rabbis of the Jews. As far as their ordinary day-to-day life
was concerned they were respectable citizens, but what happened? Why
they crucified Jesus? Why</p><p>so many people have been burned by the churches, alive, and with no
shame, with no guilt? -- -because it is being done in the name of god,
it is being done in the name of love, it is being done in the name of
the truth, in the name of religion.</p><p>The mob psychology remains animalistic hidden behind a garbage of
so-called religious jargon.</p><p>To become part of it is ugly. It is a betrayal to your own self. It
is suicidal. To be part of a mob psychology simply means you have
committed a spiritual suicide, you are no more an individual. You have
lost your intelligence.</p><p>I have observed it, I have asked people, because I have been witness
to many things. Hindus burning a Mohammedan mosque, and I watched the
whole process and the people who were burning were respectable people.
Nobody could have ever thought that these people can burn, destroy. Than
I asked them individually, later on, 'Could you have done it alone?',
and they immediately said 'No. Even to think of doing such a thing alone
is not possible. We cannot imagine ourselves doing it. We did it because
everybody was doing it. We were just part of it, we are not
responsible'.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>I have seen Mohammedans killing HIndus and I have asked them, 'Can
you do it individually?' And they have said 'No, we can do it only when
we are part of a mob, when we are no more separate from the mob --</p><p>then there is no responsibility, then it is being already done.
Whether we participate or not makes no difference.'</p><p>Meditation brings you out of the mob psychology. First it makes you
human and then it takes you towards the superhuman, which is divine in
other words, but it is rebellion; hence the crowd has never been able to
forgive meditators and it will never be able.</p><p>I am not a pessimist; I am immensely optimist, for the simple reason
because I see humanity growing, coming of age, but this is a fact --
even optimism cannot hide it -- that the mob psychology will never be
able to rise to the levels of individual psychology. It may become a
little better, but the difference between the individual and the crowd
will remain constantly the same.</p><p>When the crowd psychology will go a little higher, the individual
rebellion will also go a little higher.</p><p>The distance will remain the same. And it is really a joy to rebel
against all that is rotten, ugly, against all that is dead, stinking. It
is a joy, it is a challenge, and it is a great opportunity to grow. Only
individuals can grow into godliness. And I insist and emphasise that
only individuals can be religious; religion can never be a cult, a
creed, a church. The moment it becomes a church, cult, creed, it is not
religion at all. it is just camouflaged politics.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Agni. Dhyan means meditation, Agni means fire.</p><p>Meditation is a fire. It does two things: it burns your past totally,
it consumes your mind absolutely without even leaving a trace behind it,
and your past contains everything -- your religion, your politics, your
nationality, your race, and all that. It contains all that is wrong. It
is just junk which we have been loaded by others.</p><p>The fire of meditation consumes it totally and the moment it has
consumed all that is not part of you but has been forced upon you, which
is just a conditioning but not your being, the moment it is destroyed
your being for the first time rises above because it is no more
burdened, no more crushed under the weight of the past -- and the weight
of the past is big, it is mountainous and your being is just like a rose
flower, very delicate.</p><p>The moment rocks are removed the rose starts growing; hence the fire
of meditation does two work.</p><p>One; it is a death and second, it is a resurrection, a new beginning,
a rebirth.</p><p>Jesus says to Nicodemus 'Unless you are born again you shall not
enter into my kingdom of god.' That's what exactly meditation does; it
destroys you as you are and it resurrects you as you should be.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Dheeren. Dhyan means meditation, Dheeren means the
patient one.</p><p>Meditation needs infinite patience. One cannot grow into meditation
in a hurry. It can never be like instant coffee. It is not a seasonal
flower. It is like the star touching big Cedars of Lebanon: it takes
hundreds of years for those trees to rise above into the sky. And they
live for thousands of years.</p><p>Meditation is going to give you the whole eternity; hence it cannot
be achieved in a hurry; One has to be really patient. And this is one of
the qualities modern humanity has completely lost track of, it is one of
the contributions of the western mind to the whole world; this hurry,
this constant rush.</p><p>There is a basic reason for it. The Judaic religion and it offshoots
-- Christianity and Islam -- these three religions are the root cause of
it, because they have been talking about only one life. If this is the
only life than naturally one is in a rush.</p><p>Just seventy years, if you are fortunate, and if you calculate you
will find that that is not much; one-third of it will be lost in sleep.
Much of it will be lost in the schools, colleges, university, reading
all kinds of stupid things -- geography, history, geology, zoology and
what not!</p><p>Much of it will be lost in earning bread and butter, much of it will,
will be lost by going to the factory or the office from the home and
coming back -- almost there are people who are travelling two, three
hours every day from the office to the home. The remaining little bit
will be lost in seeing that idiot box, TV or going to a movie or shaving
your beard every day or twice a day, taking bath and eating food and all
kinds of things -- if you simply go on calculating it will be a miracle
if you can save seven minutes out of seventy years life. Than it is too
short: seven minutes between birth and death and all is finished and
finished forever! It is bound to create panic -- and that" what has
happened in the West.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

never been so in the East because we had a vast canvas, there was no
hurry. Thousands of life -- actually India has been talking about
eight-hundred-forty-million lives. That created its own trouble; it
created lethargy, lousiness. You cannot rely on anybody. He will say 'I
will come five o'clock' and he may not turn for seven days and still he
will not feel guilty or ashamed. he will say 'What is there? If not that
Sunday this Sunday I have come, if not five, then six, then seven -- it
doesn't matter much.' All trains are running late...</p><p>A man once asked the station master 'That whenever I come the train
is late, than why do you publish the timetable?' The station master said
'We publish the timetable so we can know how much the train is late!</p><p>Otherwise how we will know? It has nothing to do for the train to
come in time; it is just to know that how much late it is.'</p><p>Everything is lousy, everything is lazy -- that is a bad implication
of it -- but one thing was great in it, that nobody was in a hurry. That
helped immensely meditation. It is not an accident that meditation grew
in the East. It is inevitable that it could have only grown in the East
where people are ready to wait. There is no expectation in waiting; they
simply enjoy waiting.</p><p>I know that both the attitudes have their good points and bad points.
The West has been able to bring things in order, it has been able to
discipline things. Trains are in time, people are efficient, nobody is
lazy or lousy-that's good about it -- but then it creates a certain
tension inside.</p><p>The whole life you are running so when somebody says that meditation
is just sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass
grows by itself, you listen it but you cannot understand it -- how the
grass can grow by itself if you don't pull it up? And just sitting
silently? I used to have this darshan in my lawn, I had to change,
because people were continuously pulling the grass -- they were
destroying the lawn!</p><p>They were simply trying to help the grass... nothing. How the grass
is going to grow by itself? They were in a hurry.</p><p>You just watch people: they are in a hurry for no reason. Hurry has
become their lifestyle.</p><p>I want my sannyasins to understand this very clearly. I don't want
them to be lazy and lousy, I don't want them to be in constant hurry and
tension and always running, not exactly knowing why.</p><p>Two old man were talking with each other: 'Do you remember in our
young days we used to chase women?' The other said 'Yes, I remember
perfectly well. The only thing I don't remember is <em>why</em> we used
to chase them'</p><p>Nobody exactly knows why you are running and nobody has time to ask
you either. Everybody is saying</p><p>'See you soon,' (can't get it??) they are on the way.</p><p>My sannyasins have to create a synthesis. As far as the outside world
is concerned the western attitude is absolutely right; everything should
be done as totally, as perfectly as possible, because there may be no
other moment to improve upon, and don't leave this world with something
incomplete. That will be your signature. Leave this world with something
complete, perfected, to your heart's content -- that's perfectly
beautiful as far as the outside world is concerned. The western approach
is absolutely correct. For the outside existence I would like the whole
world to become the West.</p><p>And for the inside world I would like the whole world to become the
East: there don't be in a hurry, there just sit and don't pull the
grass. Just sit silently, wait, let things happen. You watch, you don't
be a doer</p><p>-- that watching is meditation, that non-doing is meditation, that
waiting is meditation.</p><p>Up to now we have been dividing the world in a geographical way, in
East and West, in two hemispheres. I would like to divide in a totally
different way: not the earth, not the globe, not geography, but
<em>each</em> man,.. his outside is the West, his inside is the East.
And each man has to be a total world. When he is working on the outside,
work perfectly, efficiently and when you are inside, forget all about
the outside world and its methods, than relax. Then just fall into a
let-go -- that is the meaning of your name: falling into a deep
let-go.</p><p>And then it happens -- remember, it happens. It cannot be done. It is
a happening!</p><p>How long you will be here? (at least a year)</p><p>That's good. This is what I mean by becoming eastern as far as the
inner side is concerned. Perfectly good! Help him.</p><p>Help him. Come her. Good. I have been waiting for YOU ... and finally
you have come.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Sakshi. Dhyan means meditation, Sakshi means a witness.

centre all that is happening. Many things are happening on the outside
-- the noise of the train far away; something is happening in you body
--</p><p>your knees are hurting -- right? Your mind is churning many thoughts,
that 'What am I doing here?' Your heart is feeling many emotions, you
have waited for this moment for so long. There is joy in the heart, a
certain ecstasy, a mood, a receptivity. All those things have to be
watched very minutely. Watching them opens your inner being. Just
watching them opens your inner eye and that is the real eye; the outside
eyes are of not much use. You are fortunate that you don't have them.
You are blessed! Blessed are the blind for they shall not be forced to
see this ugly world! And it is really ugly -- believe me!</p><p>And you can put your total energy for the inner eye. The outside eyes
are wasting eighty percent of energy -- it is the major part. Man has
five senses, eighty per cent is taken away by the eyes and only twenty
per cent is left for the other four senses. They are very poor people,
those four. Eyes are very rich, they have monopolised the whole thing;
hence it is good -- eighty per cent energy is saved -- and that can be
immediately used for witnessing, for seeing your inner world. hence in
the East we call a person who is blind 'pragyanshakshu' -- this</p><p>word is untranslatable. It simply means one who has the inner eye:
The outer eyes are not there but that is a great opportunity because
eighty per cent of energy is available for the person and he can easily
become a meditator, more easily then anybody else.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that blind people have better ears than
anybody else. They become beautiful musicians, good singers, for the
simple reason, for their eighty per cent energy is diverted towards the
ears.</p><p>Ears are the closest to the eyes, so when the eyes are not using the
energy the ears start using it.</p><p>But that is again a misuse because ears will again take it outside.
It is better to use this available energy for your observation, inner
observation.</p><p>Just watch everything -- and it is good because you have nothing much
to do. You have not to go here and there and visit people and become a
member of the Rotary Club. You are saved from so much nonsense that I
felt really jealous of you! Enjoy it! And feel sorry for everybody else!
They are poorer and you can become immensely rich. And the art of that
richness is witnessing.</p><p>Witnessing is another name for meditation. How long you will be
here?</p><p>(Three weeks)</p><p>That's good. And when you are coming back again? (In November)</p><p>That's good. help him. Good!</p><p>Ma Dhyan Anutoshi. Dhyan means meditation, Anutoshi means absolutely
contented.</p><p>Meditation and contentment are like the flower and its fragrance;
meditation is the flower and contentment is its fragrance; hence the
people who try to cultivate contentment are starting on a wrong journey.
A cultivated contentment is not contentment at all; it is like a
spraying perfume on a plastic flower.</p><p>you can deceive others but how can you deceive yourself? And what is
the point of deception? It is dangerous because time is lost,
opportunity is lost.</p><p>One can cultivate contentment, there are millions of people who have
cultivated contentment. Seeing that the grapes are too far way they have
started consoling themselves that the grapes are sour -- that's what
they mean by contentment: seeing that they cannot be rich they start
saying 'Poverty is spiritual,' because to be rich one needs guts.</p><p>Everybody is born poor- that is nothing much -- but to be rich it is
a very competitive world, it is a cut-throat competition. Everybody is
at everybody's throat. The cowards escape but they have also to invent
some consolation for themselves. They start saying 'What is there in
richness? Gold is nothing but dust and money is for the worldly people;
it is not fort the spiritual ones.' They start greeting a new kind of
ego. They are other-worldly, spiritual, religious; they are not
interested in money, in power. They have renounced it all, as if they
had it in the first place.</p><p>This is a very pseudo state. One has created a subtle wall of
consolations around oneself to hide one's wounds.</p><p>And people will respect such a person, they will call him a saint.
And because people respect and honour and start thinking that he is
religious, a very saintly person, holy, the ego feels even more
satisfied, more nourished. It becomes just a ego-number -- and how ego
can ever be contented? Hence a new 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

how to be holier then other holier people?</p><p>Just tell any saint that 'some other saint is higher then you.' and
immediately you will see where his contentment is gone; immediately he
is angry, immediately he is enraged, all his humbleness is lost, all his
simplicity gone. It is a new kind of power struggle, a very subtle one;
hence I don't tell to my sannyasins that cultivate anything --
contentment, joy, peace, compassion, service, duty --</p><p>nothing should be cultivated.</p><p>Everything cultivated remains phony. The true comes only through
meditation.</p><p>First become more aware, more alert, more watchful, more observant of
life and all its workings, of mind and all its processes, of the heart
and all its subtle undercurrents -- of feelings, moods -- become aware
of the world and how you react to the world. Just go on becoming more
and more like a mirror. To be a mirror is to be meditative. Reflect
everything without any judgement, and then a moment comes when all the
thoughts disappear, just by watching them -- nothing else is needed. All
the feelings disappear, all the moods disappear. One becomes utterly
empty, clean, clear, and in that clarity flowers start showering --</p><p>flowers of contentment, of joy, of ecstasy. Then you are not doing
anything to bring them. They are coming on their own accord. They come
as a gift from the god. And when something comes as a gift it has a
beauty of its own.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #21</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

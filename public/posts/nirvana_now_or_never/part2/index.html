It is for reference purposes only.]\nSwami Dhyan Apurvo. Dhyan means meditation. Apurvo means unique.\nThe experience of meditation is only unique experience in life. Everything else is repetitive. Meditation is never repeated, because it is forever. Once it happens, it remains -- there is no way to fall out of it. One can fall on love, one can fall out of love; one can fall in meditation, but one cannot fall out of meditation.\nThe reason one cannot fall out of it is because the moment you fall in, you disappear -- there is nobody to fall out, nobody remains to fall out.\nMeditation means the disappearance of the mind and its centre, the ego; hence all other experiences, howsoever beautiful they may be, become repetitive. And\nanything that is repeated loses blissfulness, it loses newness, it loses youthfulness, aliveness -- slowly slowly it becomes flat. The peak that was once there in the beginning disappears. Then one can go on repeating it in the hope that the same thing will happen again, but it is not possible.\nRepetition is mechanical, and our whole life is mechanical. Your love, your hobbies, your work, your relationships, your friendships -- yes, they give a certain pleasure, a certain happiness, but the honeymoon is soon over. And then a great frustration sets in, a tremendous hopelessness, because one cannot see why the joy disappeared: \"I am doing the same thing, everything is the same, and yet nothing is the same.\"\nIn fact the moment you repeat something, even a second time, you are already losing ground because now you know what it is. When it happened for the first time you were in for a great surprise; that element of surprise was very essential in the joy. Now there is no surprise. It is like going to see the same movie again: now you know all the sequences -- from the very beginning, you know the end, you know what is going to happen next. There is no excitement, you cannot even pretend that you are excited.\nIt is like listening to the same joke: the first time it really triggers laughter. The reason is surprise. The whole art of a joke is that it takes a sudden turn, ;the punchline is a sudden turn. You were expecting a certain logical sequence and then it takes such an absurd turn that you could not have imagined it. That very shock releases your tension. You were becoming tense: \"What is going to happen? What is going to happen?\" You were coming to an inner climax and then, suddenly, what happens is so unexpected that you cannot do anything else but laugh -- laugh at the whole ridiculousness of logic -- because life always takes such turns. But listening to the same joke again cannot be the same. How can it be the same? -- you know the punchline already. In life everything turns out to be a repetition of the same joke; hence people live utterly bored.\nThis is unique about meditation: only the person who knows meditation is never bored. Then it is impossible for him to be bored, because meditation is the disappearance of your personality, of your mind, of your thinking process. It is falling into such an abyss that the deeper you fall, the less you are. A moment comes when you are no more -- and when you are no more you come home.\nThat state of nothingness, nobodiness, is meditation. Hence I don't know any\nother experience which can be called unique, except meditation. And the real seeker will search for this unique dimension because only this can be a fulfilment. Unless one finds a source of joy that is infinite, inexhaustible, one cannot be contented, one cannot be at ease with existence. And to be at ease with existence, to be utterly relaxed and at ease with existence, with no conflict, no anguish, no desire to be victorious or to be the first -- all that nonsense is gone, one is simply enjoying of being a sannyasin.\nWith nothingness inside, outside you gain the whole universe. The moment you are no more, the whole belongs to you.\nMa Dhyan Gandharvo. Dhyan means meditation. Gandharvo is an eastern metaphysical word -- part of religious mythology, but significant. The gandharvas are the celestial musicians, the musicians who play for god. Gandharvo means the ultimate musician, whom there is no surpassing.\nMeditation is the ultimate music. It is the music which is not created by any instrument, it is the music that arises in your silence. It is the sound of silence. It is the harmony that is hear when all noise has disappeared. When the mind with its thousands of voices is gone and your inner space is utterly empty, silent, still, that stillness itself has a tremendous music to it. And out of that music is all creativity, true 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- creativity.\nOrdinary creativity is out of the mind. Then one can compose a poem, one can paint a picture, one can do a thousand and one things; but because they are done by the mind, they are more or less compositions rather than creations. The mind always gathers things from everywhere and goes on trying new combinations. Certainly the new combination looks as if it is something original: it never is, it is only a new combination.\nBut there is another creativity that comes from the silence of meditation, that comes from the music of your inner space. It is not done by you, you are not the\ndoer. The mind is a doer; meditation is a state of non-doing, it is effortlessness, but out of that non-doing great things have come into the world. All that is truly beautiful -- if may be painting, it may be poetry, music or architecture, sculpture\n-- has come not from the mind but from meditation. Meditation is just the opposite of mind, it is the absence of the mind. And when something comes spontaneously out of you, without any effort on your part, it has a beauty of its own, a grace. It has the touch of the beyond, a ray of the divine is present in it.\nMy sannyasins have to be creators, not through the mind but through meditation. And it comes of its own accord, one need not even think about it. So I don't teach creativity, I only teach silence. And then out of that silence much creativity comes. One is surprised oneself at how much one was carrying in one's being, unexpressed, at how great was one's potential. When one comes across it one cannot believes it!\nMy observation is that everybody is a born genius, but very few people have been able to discover it.\nAnd the people who have discovered it are the people who have known moments of silence in some way, either accidentally, as with scientists, poets, musicians, painters; or deliberately, as with the mystics. For a poet it is just accidental to feel silence. He does not know how it comes, when it comes, why it comes and why it disappears. He has no understanding about it. It is something mysterious that visits him, overwhelms him, and in those moments of silence, poetry starts flowing, songs arise and he can see that they are not coming from him, they are coming from some other source. That's why Mohammed says that the Koran is not his creation, it has come from god. The Vedic seers say that god has created the Vedas, and the same is true about all the religious scriptures: they all say god has created them. That is just a way of seeing it.\nThe scientific fact is that it was coming from some unknown source, it was not coming from them; naturally they called that unknown source god. But I don't call it god. That unknown source is your real being, your authentic being. It is really coming from you. When something comes from the mind it is not from you because mind is all borrowed; it is information, knowledge, education. All that has been put together by others -- the parents, the teachers, the priests -- is implanted in you from the outside. So whatsoever comes out of mind is not yours, and whatsoever comes from your silence is truly yours. In that way Mohammed, Jesus, the Vedic mystics, are all saying something which is a little\nbit primitive.\nA far more refined version is to say that it was coming from their own innermost core of which they were not clearly aware. Somehow they were still identified with their mind. Some hangover, some small attachment with the mind, some illusory idea was still haunting them that they were the mind; hence that which came from somewhere else must have come from god -- that was their inference.\nBut my own experience is that the moment you are disidentified with the mind you suddenly become aware that now whatsoever is coming, is coming from your real source. Of course you cannot call it \"my\" or\n\"mine\", because those words belong to the mind, but this is your true being.\nA sannyasin has to learn only one thing: how to be silent and meditative, how to be separate from the mind, disidentified from the mind. And then everything else follows -- a great creativity, a great sensitivity.\nAnd whatsoever is you potential starts blossoming as if suddenly a spring has come to your inner world.\nSannyas is springtime. It is a new climate in which seeds sprout, buds open up and become flowers, in which the potential self becomes the actualised self.\nSwami Dhyan Yogesh. Dhyan means meditation. Yogesh means god of yoga.\nYoga means union, the science of union; hence your full name will mean: meditation is the suprememost phenomenon as far as union with reality is concerned, meditation is the god of yoga. But yoga has fallen into wrong hands, and not only recently -- for centuries it has been in the wrong hands.\nThe original fault must go to the founder, Patanjali himself. Patanjali has divided yoga into eight parts.\nHis division is clear-cut, very scientific, but he was not really aware of human stupidity.\nHe started with the body -- and that's the right way to start The first part of yoga must be physiological because man lives on the circumference, in the body, so the work has to start there, only then can it reach 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe mind. And when one has gone beyond the body and beyond the mind, then the third, meditation, happens.\nSo according to Patanjali the first part belongs to the body. But he was not clearly aware that millions of people would remain entangled with the first part. Hence yoga has become synonymous with yoga postures: people standing on their heads and doing all sorts of contortions -- that has become synonymous with yoga.\nIt is not a true yoga, it is just the preface, the introductory part; and the person who thinks the introduction is the whole book is idiotic. But Patanjali did not warn people. If he had warned people it would have been better.\nPeople like Patanjali believe in other's intelligence -- which is not there! (laughter) They trust. Their trust is immense, their trust is as immense as people's stupidity is!(more laughter) They respect people's intelligence. So he did not warn people, but the warning was absolutely necessary: \"Don't get entangled in the physiological part\".\nA few people, only very few -- if a hundred people become interested in yoga then only one person will get out of physiological entanglement. And that one person will become entangled in the psychological. If a hundred persons are entangled in the psychological then only one person gets out of it -- and only when you get out of the mind does the real yoga begin.\nThe physiological part of yoga will give you great physiological powers; it can make you live a really long, healthy life. But what are you going to do with a long life? If you are idiotic, instead of being idiotic for seventy years you will be idiotic for two hundred years. It is not going to help anybody, it will be a calamity.\nThere was a man called Nadir Shah -- one of the most notorious, murderous men in the whole history of humanity. He invaded India at least one hundred and eight times. He killed more people in India than anybody else. And he had his\nown ways of torturing: he would put the whole town on fire and surround the town with his army so nobody could escape -- and he would enjoy it!\nThis man asked an astrologer, because he had heard of his fame, \"What do you say? What is your advice? -- should a man live long, very long, or should one live only the average, seventy years?\" The astrologer must have really a wise man. He said, \"It all depends. If a man like you lives long, it is bad, it is unfortunate. In the first place a man like you should not be born; and in the second place, if he is born, then he should die immediately. And in the third place, if he manages to live somehow, then the sooner he dies, the better.\"\nNadir Shah was very angry. This was the first man who had not bothered about his murderous attitude, this was the first man who had said the truth as it was.\nNadir Shah said \"I will kill you.\" The astrologer said\n\"That doesn't matter, you can kill me, but I have to tell the truth. The truth is that if men like you do live, they should sleep twenty-four hours a day (laughter) and drink as much as they can!\"\nNadir Shah was so shocked but the man was so truthful that even Nadir Shah had to leave him alone.\nEven he could not gather courage to kill such a man. He felt shaken and he remembered him again and again:\"What a man! Almost a dragon! He made me tremble -- the way he looked at me and the way he said things. I had never expected anybody would have such courage.\" But he respected the astrologer.\nYoga can make a person live long, but what will you do? That physiological part should not be paid so much attention. Yes, a little bit is good to keep physically fit, but just a little bit; otherwise it is a vast jungle: one can be lost in its subtleties, in its complexities.\nAnd the second part is even vaster than the physiological. If you get into it you can have many psychic powers, you can read people's thoughts -- but what is the point? Your rubbish is so much (laughter), what is the point of reading somebody else's rubbish? He is tortured by his rubbish and you are reading his thoughts\n-- and you think you are doing something great!\nThe real thing is to get rid of thoughts, not to read them. One even has to get rid\nof one's own thoughts; what is the point of reading other people's thoughts? And what is there? You can stand by the side of the road and you can see a man is walking along and thinking of his dog -- so what? (laughter) Just this morning I was telling a story. A postmaster was being tortured by his wife. It was a usual phenomenon -- the poor postmaster. And his wife was a real amazon! (laughter) Once she started it was impossible to stop her unless some accident, some calamity happened -- earthquake or something like that --\notherwise she would go on and on.… And the poor postmaster was sitting there, listening. After half an hour the wife said \"What is the matter with you? I have been talking and talking and you have not said even a single word -- can't you hear me? Are you deaf or dumb? What is the matter with you?\"\nAnd the poor postmaster said \"I am hearing every single word -- not only hearing, in fact I am counting 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhow much it would have cost if you had sent a telegram (much laughter): eighty- four rupees and thirty paise. I have been counting!\" (much laughter)\nIf you listen to people's thoughts, what will you find? The postmaster is counting how much it will cost, somebody is thinking of his cow, somebody is thinking of his buffalo, somebody is thinking of his wife, somebody is thinking of somebody else's wife! (much laughter) And you are thinking what they are thinking! Maybe the other person is also a yogi and is reading somebody else's thoughts (laughter)... then things become very complicated!\nThe physiological part is ordinary, the psychological part is ordinary. Both can give power, but power is not the goal of meditation. Power is politics, all kinds of power is politics. And power corrupts -- all kinds of power -- it corrupts unconditionally and absolutely; it always corrupts. Hence I say the only essential thing, the real core of all religion, of all yoga, of all methods of search, is meditation.\nOne should put aside everything non-essential. You can use things as stepping\nstones, but not more than that -- just like jumping boards. You need not bother too much about them. Your whole concern should be one-pointed; you should move like an arrow towards meditation, only then in this small life, with so little time, power and energy available and with so many problems surrounding you, can you hope that the arrow will reach the target.\nAnd the moment you know something of meditation -- not about it, but the very taste of it -- a great release comes. a great relief comes. Suddenly all tensions disappear: anxieties, anguishes, are found no more. Even if you want them just for a change, you cannot find them. I have tried and failed! (laughter) Sometimes I try very hard to find some anxiety but I cannot, it simply does not work. I have tried all possible ways, from this side and that side, but I come to the same end: it does not work.\nOnce you have tasted meditation it is impossible for you to be in any misery. Bliss becomes inevitable, a natural showering, and it goes on showering like flowers showering from the sky.\nSwami Dhyan Manish. Dhyan means meditation. Manish means the wise one.\nMind can never impart wisdom to you. It can give you immense knowledge, it can make you very knowledgeable, it can make you a great thinker, a philosopher, a scientist, but it cannot make you wise --\nthat is beyond its capacity. And unless you are wise you remain a fool.\nThe philosopher is only a philosopher on the surface; deep down you will find a foolosopher. Just scratch him a little bit and you will find all kinds of foolishnesses in him.\nAristotle is one of the greatest philosophers of the world, but he says so many foolish things. For example, he writes that women have fewer teeth than men -- and he had two wifes, not only one but two so he could have counted them. And it is so easy to count women's teeth because their mouths are always open! (much laughter) The greatest problem is how to keep a woman's mouth shut! (more laughter) He could have counted any time! If not while they were awake -\n- if he was afraid -- then he could have counted while the women were asleep -- but he never bothered. Jest the idea that a woman cannot have anything equal to man, that man is a superior being, prevented him.\nThis is foolishness, utter stupidity. But there is a foundation in that foolishness: the foundation is that man is superior in every way, so how can he have the same number of teeth? The woman must have fewer teeth than a man -- it is a logical conclusion on his part. He could have done a small experiment but he never did.\nYou will find so many foolish things in philosophers, unbelievably foolish -- but to me the reason is clear: they are not wise. That is the difference between a Buddha and a Aristotle, the difference between a Bodhidharma and an Emmanuel Kant. The East has respected the mystic, not the philosopher. We have also produced many philosophers but nobody had taken any note of them. They have been ignored. Although they have written great treatises, interpretations, theologies, nobody has taken any note of them. In the West just the opposite has happened: the philosopher has been taken into much consideration and the mystic has been neglected, ignored.\nFor example, Dionysius or Pythagoras or Plotinus or Eckhart -- these people are not counted at all. You will not find their names mentioned even in the history of philosophy taught in the western universities.\nThey are not in the main current.\nMind seems to be more important in the West. And of course mind has given many things: great scholarship, knowledge, science. But if basically man remains foolish, then all knowledge and all science is going to turn against him. It is like giving a naked sword to a small child. And that's what is happening: two 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nworld wars, so much destruction, and the third is imminent, any moment. We are always on the verge of it: just any fool...\nMm, now this cowboy (laughter), Ronald Reagan... He has been a third-rate actor. In those films in which he was working it was his job to kill as many times as possible and to be killed as many times as possible. Now this man can just trigger a button and can involve the whole earth in total destruction. Just one\nsingle fool, and for some small reason.…\nMaybe he had a very tiring day and his wife says something and then he becomes angry and just pushes the button! (much laughter) \"Enough is enough!\" Or perhaps he has a migraine, or just like Maneesha he is suffering from stomach pain and amoebas, (Bhagwan's hand gestures towards me, sitting just by his right. I laugh and love the intimacy of the mention.) then he just... And the world is finished! (much laughter) Unless you kill humanity you cannot kill amoebas!\nThat power is possible through the mind but where will you find the wisdom to use it rightly? There is only one source, I call it meditation. Meditation does not make you more knowledgeable. It simply makes you more sensible, more sensitive, more alert, more intelligent, more aware -- not more informed, but more transformed, more illumined.\nA deep illumination -- that is the meaning of Manish. It means your inner world is no longer dark, it has become full of light.

diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>Swami Dhyan Apurvo. Dhyan means meditation. Apurvo means unique.</p><p>The experience of meditation is only unique experience in life.
Everything else is repetitive. Meditation is never repeated, because it
is forever. Once it happens, it remains -- there is no way to fall out
of it. One can fall on love, one can fall out of love; one can fall in
meditation, but one cannot fall out of meditation.</p><p>The reason one cannot fall out of it is because the moment you fall
in, you disappear -- there is nobody to fall out, nobody remains to fall
out.</p><p>Meditation means the disappearance of the mind and its centre, the
ego; hence all other experiences, howsoever beautiful they may be,
become repetitive. And</p><p>anything that is repeated loses blissfulness, it loses newness, it
loses youthfulness, aliveness -- slowly slowly it becomes flat. The peak
that was once there in the beginning disappears. Then one can go on
repeating it in the hope that the same thing will happen again, but it
is not possible.</p><p>Repetition is mechanical, and our whole life is mechanical. Your
love, your hobbies, your work, your relationships, your friendships --
yes, they give a certain pleasure, a certain happiness, but the
honeymoon is soon over. And then a great frustration sets in, a
tremendous hopelessness, because one cannot see why the joy disappeared:
"I am doing the same thing, everything is the same, and yet nothing is
the same."</p><p>In fact the moment you repeat something, even a second time, you are
already losing ground because now you know what it is. When it happened
for the first time you were in for a great surprise; that element of
surprise was very essential in the joy. Now there is no surprise. It is
like going to see the same movie again: now you know all the sequences
-- from the very beginning, you know the end, you know what is going to
happen next. There is no excitement, you cannot even pretend that you
are excited.</p><p>It is like listening to the same joke: the first time it really
triggers laughter. The reason is surprise. The whole art of a joke is
that it takes a sudden turn, ;the punchline is a sudden turn. You were
expecting a certain logical sequence and then it takes such an absurd
turn that you could not have imagined it. That very shock releases your
tension. You were becoming tense: "What is going to happen? What is
going to happen?" You were coming to an inner climax and then, suddenly,
what happens is so unexpected that you cannot do anything else but laugh
-- laugh at the whole ridiculousness of logic -- because life always
takes such turns. But listening to the same joke again cannot be the
same. How can it be the same? -- you know the punchline already. In life
everything turns out to be a repetition of the same joke; hence people
live utterly bored.</p><p>This is unique about meditation: only the person who knows meditation
is never bored. Then it is impossible for him to be bored, because
meditation is the disappearance of your personality, of your mind, of
your thinking process. It is falling into such an abyss that the deeper
you fall, the less you are. A moment comes when you are no more -- and
when you are no more you come home.</p><p>That state of nothingness, nobodiness, is meditation. Hence I don't
know any</p><p>other experience which can be called unique, <em>except</em>
meditation. And the real seeker will search for this unique dimension
because only this can be a fulfilment. Unless one finds a source of joy
that is infinite, inexhaustible, one cannot be contented, one cannot be
at ease with existence. And to be at ease with existence, to be utterly
relaxed and at ease with existence, with no conflict, no anguish, no
desire to be victorious or to be the first -- all that nonsense is gone,
one is simply enjoying of being a sannyasin.</p><p>With nothingness inside, outside you gain the whole universe. The
moment you are no more, the whole belongs to you.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Gandharvo. Dhyan means meditation. Gandharvo is an eastern
metaphysical word -- part of religious mythology, but significant. The
gandharvas are the celestial musicians, the musicians who play for god.
Gandharvo means the ultimate musician, whom there is no surpassing.</p><p>Meditation is the ultimate music. It is the music which is not
created by any instrument, it is the music that arises in your silence.
It is the sound of silence. It is the harmony that is hear when all
noise has disappeared. When the mind with its thousands of voices is
gone and your inner space is utterly empty, silent, still, that
stillness itself has a tremendous music to it. And out of that music is
all creativity, true 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- creativity.</p><p>Ordinary creativity is out of the mind. Then one can compose a poem,
one can paint a picture, one can do a thousand and one things; but
because they are done by the mind, they are more or less compositions
rather than creations. The mind always gathers things from everywhere
and goes on trying new combinations. Certainly the new combination looks
as if it is something original: it never is, it is only a new
combination.</p><p>But there is another creativity that comes from the silence of
meditation, that comes from the music of your inner space. It is not
done by you, you are not the</p><p>doer. The mind is a doer; meditation is a state of non-doing, it is
effortlessness, but out of that non-doing great things have come into
the world. All that is truly beautiful -- if may be painting, it may be
poetry, music or architecture, sculpture</p><p>-- has come not from the mind but from meditation. Meditation is just
the opposite of mind, it is the absence of the mind. And when something
comes spontaneously out of you, without any effort on your part, it has
a beauty of its own, a grace. It has the touch of the beyond, a ray of
the divine is present in it.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be creators, not through the mind but through
meditation. And it comes of its own accord, one need not even think
about it. So I don't teach creativity, I only teach silence. And then
out of that silence much creativity comes. One is surprised oneself at
how much one was carrying in one's being, unexpressed, at how great was
one's potential. When one comes across it one cannot believes it!</p><p>My observation is that everybody is a born genius, but very few
people have been able to discover it.</p><p>And the people who have discovered it are the people who have known
moments of silence in some way, either accidentally, as with scientists,
poets, musicians, painters; or deliberately, as with the mystics. For a
poet it is just accidental to feel silence. He does not know how it
comes, when it comes, why it comes and why it disappears. He has no
understanding about it. It is something mysterious that visits him,
overwhelms him, and in those moments of silence, poetry starts flowing,
songs arise and he can see that they are not coming from him, they are
coming from some other source. That's why Mohammed says that the Koran
is not <em>his</em> creation, it has come from god. The Vedic seers say
that god has created the Vedas, and the same is true about all the
religious scriptures: they all say god has created them. That is just a
way of seeing it.</p><p>The scientific fact is that it was coming from some unknown source,
it was not coming from them; naturally they called that unknown source
god. But I don't call it god. That unknown source is your real being,
your authentic being. It is <em>really</em> coming from you. When
something comes from the mind it is not from you because mind is all
borrowed; it is information, knowledge, education. All that has been put
together by others -- the parents, the teachers, the priests -- is
implanted in you from the outside. So whatsoever comes out of mind is
not yours, and whatsoever comes from your silence is truly yours. In
that way Mohammed, Jesus, the Vedic mystics, are all saying something
which is a little</p><p>bit primitive.</p><p>A far more refined version is to say that it was coming from their
own innermost core of which they were not clearly aware. Somehow they
were still identified with their mind. Some hangover, some small
attachment with the mind, some illusory idea was still haunting them
that they were the mind; hence that which came from somewhere else must
have come from god -- that was their inference.</p><p>But my own experience is that the moment you are disidentified with
the mind you suddenly become aware that now whatsoever is coming, is
coming from your real source. Of course you cannot call it "my" or</p><p>"mine", because those words belong to the mind, but this is your true
being.</p><p>A sannyasin has to learn only one thing: how to be silent and
meditative, how to be separate from the mind, disidentified from the
mind. And then everything else follows -- a great creativity, a great
sensitivity.</p><p>And whatsoever is you potential starts blossoming as if suddenly a
spring has come to your inner world.</p><p>Sannyas is springtime. It is a new climate in which seeds sprout,
buds open up and become flowers, in which the potential self becomes the
actualised self.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Yogesh. Dhyan means meditation. Yogesh means god of
yoga.</p><p>Yoga means union, the science of union; hence your full name will
mean: meditation is the suprememost phenomenon as far as union with
reality is concerned, meditation is the god of yoga. But yoga has fallen
into wrong hands, and not only recently -- for centuries it has been in
the wrong hands.</p><p>The original fault must go to the founder, Patanjali himself.
Patanjali has divided yoga into eight parts.</p><p>His division is clear-cut, very scientific, but he was not really
aware of human stupidity.</p><p>He started with the body -- and that's the right way to start The
first part of yoga must be physiological because man lives on the
circumference, in the body, so the work has to start there, only then
can it reach 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>the mind. And when one has gone beyond the body <em>and</em> beyond
the mind, then the third, meditation, happens.</p><p>So according to Patanjali the first part belongs to the body. But he
was not clearly aware that millions of people would remain entangled
with the first part. Hence yoga has become synonymous with yoga
postures: people standing on their heads and doing all sorts of
contortions -- that has become synonymous with yoga.</p><p>It is not a true yoga, it is just the preface, the introductory part;
and the person who thinks the introduction is the whole book is idiotic.
But Patanjali did not warn people. If he had warned people it would have
been better.</p><p>People like Patanjali believe in other's intelligence -- which is not
there! (laughter) They trust. Their trust is immense, their trust is as
immense as people's stupidity is!(more laughter) They respect people's
intelligence. So he did not warn people, but the warning was absolutely
necessary: "Don't get entangled in the physiological part".</p><p>A few people, only very few -- if a hundred people become interested
in yoga then only one person will get out of physiological entanglement.
And that one person will become entangled in the psychological. If a
hundred persons are entangled in the psychological then only one person
gets out of it -- and only when you get out of the mind does the
<em>real</em> yoga begin.</p><p>The physiological part of yoga will give you great physiological
powers; it can make you live a really long, healthy life. But what are
you going to do with a long life? If you are idiotic, instead of being
idiotic for seventy years you will be idiotic for two hundred years. It
is not going to help anybody, it will be a calamity.</p><p>There was a man called Nadir Shah -- one of the most notorious,
murderous men in the whole history of humanity. He invaded India at
least one hundred and eight times. He killed more people in India than
anybody else. And he had his</p><p>own ways of torturing: he would put the whole town on fire and
surround the town with his army so nobody could escape -- and he would
enjoy it!</p><p>This man asked an astrologer, because he had heard of his fame, "What
do you say? What is your advice? -- should a man live long, very long,
or should one live only the average, seventy years?" The astrologer must
have <em>really</em> a wise man. He said, "It all depends. If a man like
you lives long, it is bad, it is unfortunate. In the first place a man
like you should not be born; and in the second place, if he is born,
then he should die immediately. And in the third place, if he manages to
live somehow, then the sooner he dies, the better."</p><p>Nadir Shah was very angry. This was the first man who had
<em>not</em> bothered about his murderous attitude, this was the first
man who had said the truth as it was.</p><p>Nadir Shah said "I will kill you." The astrologer said</p><p>"That doesn't matter, you can kill me, but I have to tell the truth.
The truth is that if men like you do live, they should sleep twenty-four
hours a day (laughter) and drink as much as they can!"</p><p>Nadir Shah was so shocked but the man was so truthful that even Nadir
Shah had to leave him alone.</p><p>Even he could not gather courage to kill such a man. He felt shaken
and he remembered him again and again:"What a man! Almost a dragon! He
made me tremble -- the way he looked at me and the way he said things. I
had never expected anybody would have such courage." But he respected
the astrologer.</p><p>Yoga can make a person live long, but what will you do? That
physiological part should not be paid so much attention. Yes, a little
bit is good to keep physically fit, but just a little bit; otherwise it
is a vast jungle: one can be lost in its subtleties, in its
complexities.</p><p>And the second part is even vaster than the physiological. If you get
into it you can have many psychic powers, you can read people's thoughts
-- but what is the point? Your rubbish is so much (laughter), what is
the point of reading somebody else's rubbish? He is tortured by his
rubbish and you are reading his thoughts</p><p>-- and you think you are doing something great!</p><p>The real thing is to get rid of thoughts, not to read them. One even
has to get rid</p><p>of one's <em>own</em> thoughts; what is the point of reading other
people's thoughts? And what is there? You can stand by the side of the
road and you can see a man is walking along and thinking of his dog --
so what? (laughter) Just this morning I was telling a story. A
postmaster was being tortured by his wife. It was a usual phenomenon --
the poor postmaster. And his wife was a real amazon! (laughter) Once she
started it was impossible to stop her unless some accident, some
calamity happened -- earthquake or something like that --</p><p>otherwise she would go on and on.… And the poor postmaster was
sitting there, listening. After half an hour the wife said "What is the
matter with you? I have been talking and talking and you have not said
even a single word -- can't you hear me? Are you deaf or dumb? What is
the matter with you?"</p><p>And the poor postmaster said "I am hearing every single word -- not
only hearing, in fact I am counting 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>how much it would have cost if you had sent a telegram (much
laughter): eighty- four rupees and thirty paise. I have been counting!"
(much laughter)</p><p>If you listen to people's thoughts, what will you find? The
postmaster is counting how much it will cost, somebody is thinking of
his cow, somebody is thinking of his buffalo, somebody is thinking of
his wife, somebody is thinking of somebody else's wife! (much laughter)
And you are thinking what they are thinking! Maybe the other person is
also a yogi and is reading somebody else's thoughts (laughter)... then
things become very complicated!</p><p>The physiological part is ordinary, the psychological part is
ordinary. Both can give power, but power is not the goal of meditation.
Power is politics, all kinds of power is politics. And power corrupts --
all kinds of power -- it corrupts unconditionally and absolutely; it
always corrupts. Hence I say the only essential thing, the real core of
all religion, of all yoga, of all methods of search, is meditation.</p><p>One should put aside everything non-essential. You can use things as
stepping</p><p>stones, but not more than that -- just like jumping boards. You need
not bother too much about them. Your whole concern should be
one-pointed; you should move like an arrow towards meditation, only then
in this small life, with so little time, power and energy available and
with so many problems surrounding you, can you hope that the arrow will
reach the target.</p><p>And the moment you know something of meditation -- not about it, but
the very taste of it -- a great release comes. a great relief comes.
Suddenly all tensions disappear: anxieties, anguishes, are found no
more. Even if you want them just for a change, you cannot find them. I
have tried and failed! (laughter) Sometimes I try very hard to find some
anxiety but I cannot, it simply does not work. I have tried all possible
ways, from this side and that side, but I come to the same end: it does
not work.</p><p>Once you have tasted meditation it is impossible for you to be in any
misery. Bliss becomes inevitable, a natural showering, and it goes on
showering like flowers showering from the sky.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Manish. Dhyan means meditation. Manish means the wise
one.</p><p>Mind can never impart wisdom to you. It can give you immense
knowledge, it can make you very knowledgeable, it can make you a great
thinker, a philosopher, a scientist, but it cannot make you wise --</p><p>that is beyond its capacity. And unless you are wise you remain a
fool.</p><p>The philosopher is only a philosopher on the surface; deep down you
will find a foolosopher. Just scratch him a little bit and you will find
all kinds of foolishnesses in him.</p><p>Aristotle is one of the greatest philosophers of the world, but he
says so many foolish things. For example, he writes that women have
fewer teeth than men -- and he had <em>two</em> wifes, not only one but
two so he could have counted them. And it is so easy to count women's
teeth because their mouths are always open! (much laughter) The greatest
problem is how to keep a woman's mouth shut! (more laughter) He could
have counted <em>any</em> time! If not while they were awake -</p><p>- if he was afraid -- then he could have counted while the women were
asleep -- but he never bothered. Jest the idea that a woman cannot have
anything equal to man, that man is a superior being, prevented him.</p><p>This is foolishness, utter stupidity. But there is a foundation in
that foolishness: the foundation is that man is superior in every way,
so how can he have the same number of teeth? The woman must have fewer
teeth than a man -- it is a logical conclusion on his part. He could
have done a small experiment but he never did.</p><p>You will find so many foolish things in philosophers, unbelievably
foolish -- but to me the reason is clear: they are not wise. That is the
difference between a Buddha and a Aristotle, the difference between a
Bodhidharma and an Emmanuel Kant. The East has respected the mystic, not
the philosopher. We have also produced many philosophers but nobody had
taken any note of them. They have been ignored. Although they have
written great treatises, interpretations, theologies, nobody has taken
any note of them. In the West just the opposite has happened: the
philosopher has been taken into much consideration and the mystic has
been neglected, ignored.</p><p>For example, Dionysius or Pythagoras or Plotinus or Eckhart -- these
people are not counted at all. You will not find their names mentioned
even in the history of philosophy taught in the western
universities.</p><p>They are not in the main current.</p><p>Mind seems to be more important in the West. And of course mind has
given many things: great scholarship, knowledge, science. But if
basically man remains foolish, then all knowledge and all science is
going to turn against him. It is like giving a naked sword to a small
child. And that's what is happening: two 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

moment. We are always on the verge of it: just any fool...</p><p>Mm, now this cowboy (laughter), Ronald Reagan... He has been a
third-rate actor. In those films in which he was working it was his job
to kill as many times as possible and to be killed as many times as
possible. Now this man can just trigger a button and can involve the
whole earth in total destruction. Just one</p><p>single fool, and for some small reason.…</p><p>Maybe he had a very tiring day and his wife says something and then
he becomes angry and just pushes the button! (much laughter) "Enough is
enough!" Or perhaps he has a migraine, or just like Maneesha he is
suffering from stomach pain and amoebas, (Bhagwan's hand gestures
towards me, sitting just by his right. I laugh and love the intimacy of
the mention.) then he just... And the world is finished! (much laughter)
Unless you kill humanity you cannot kill amoebas!</p><p>That power is possible through the mind but where will you find the
wisdom to use it rightly? There is only one source, I call it
meditation. Meditation does not make you more knowledgeable. It simply
makes you more sensible, more sensitive, more alert, more intelligent,
more aware -- not more informed, but more transformed, more
illumined.</p><p>A deep illumination -- that is the meaning of Manish. It means your
inner world is no longer dark, it has become full of light. And when you
live out of your inner light all that you do is good -- good for you,
good for others, a blessing to you and also a blessing to the whole
universe.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #4</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

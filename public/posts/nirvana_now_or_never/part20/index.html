It is for reference purposes only.]\nSwami Dhyanmurti\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyanmurti. Dhyanmurti means image of meditation.\nThe image of Gautam the Buddha is exactly the image of meditation, carved into marble. It represents something of the inner. The statues of Buddha were the first statues ever made in the world. They don't represent the physiology of Buddha; it has nothing to do with his body. It represents in a symbolic way that had happened to his interiority -- the silence, the peace, the tranquillity, the purity, the innocence, the state of no-mind.\nIf you observe the statue of Buddha you will see many things. One is, it is made of white marble. White represents all the colors; it is the synthesis of all the colors. It has the whole spectrum of the rainbow hidden within it. It is the color of light, and it is light that can be divided into seven colors. Or if those seven colors are again synthesized you will have white. So the first thing is the color white -- it represents the synthesis.\nLife should be a totality, nothing should be rejected; everything should be absorbed, transformed.\nEverything has some significance, only you have to put it in the right place, in the right context.\nThe white color is the orchestra of all the colors. Many people have to work in an orchestra. They can work in discord, every player can go in his own way -- then there will be only noise, insanity, chaos, ugliness. But they all can join together, they can create a rhythm in which they all are participants. Then the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsame noise becomes music and the same energy that was turning into insanity becomes the peak of insanity, of health, of wholeness.\nThe second thing is that Buddha statues are carved out of marble. The marble is something on the earth but as if not belonging to the earth, as if part of the beyond. When you see the Taj Mahal in a full-moon night you will understand what I am saying. Then the Taj Mahal does not seem to be part of this world.\nSuddenly you are transported to a fairyland. It is so beautiful that it is almost unbelievable.\nI lived in one place, Jabalpur, for twenty years. Near Jabalpur there is one miracle of nature. I don't think there exists anywhere in the world anything comparable to it -- it is just unique. The river Narmada flows between two mountains of marble; for at least four or five miles it flows between two mountains of marble.\nIt is a rare thing. And in the full-moon night when you enter, in a boat, inside that world, suddenly another dimension of life... As if God is real and the world is unreal, as if dreams are real and matter is unreal.\nI took one of my teachers of philosophy -- he was a lover of nature so I invited him and took him; he was an old man. I took him to the marble rocks. When he saw them he said, \"Take the boat very close. I want to touch and feel whether they really exist or you are playing a trick.\" He said to me, \"I have heard that you\ncan hypnotize people. Don't do such tricks on an old man like me. And at least be respectful to me -- I have been your teacher in the university. Take me very close.\"\nI took him very close to the mountains; he had to touch them to believe them. Actually that is the case: unless you touch them you cannot believe. It seems so much a dreamland.\nThe statues of Buddha were carved in pure white marble in the beginning, just to show that this earth can have something of the beyond. And the shape of the Buddha statue is so symmetrical that one can see the balance, that everything is balanced. He talked about meditation as the middle way, majjhim nikaya..\nMeditation is really the golden mean, neither leaning to the right too much nor to the left too much, remaining exactly in the middle of all the extremes of life.\nThere is success and there is failure, and there is richness and there is poverty, and one day you are full of life and one day slips out of your hands. There is respect and there is insult. Life consists of polar opposites. The man of meditation walks exactly in the middle; neither success excites him nor failure depresses him. He remains absolutely untouched -- that is his symmetry, that is his balance, and that balance you will see in the statue of Buddha.\nBuddha's eyes in the statue are half-closed and half-open. The meditator should not close his eyes completely towards the outer, because that too is our reality. And he should not open his eyes too much so that he has nothing left for the inner world.\nHalf-closed eyes represent that one is standing just in between, available to both the worlds: the objective and the subjective, with no division, with no judgement. He will live in the world but will not be of the world.\nAnd this whole thing is the meaning of your name, Dhyanmurti. Create a golden mean in your life, create balance, symmetry, create a synthesis of all the conflicting elements within you so that they become pure white, the summum bonum, the highest combination, of all the opposites, so that they can become a cosmos instead of a chaos. Then one becomes an image of meditation itself.\nA sannyasin has to be an image, a living image of meditation, in his moment-to- moment life. In his relationship to the world, to people, in his relationship to\nhimself, while he is alone, when he is with people; in every kind of situation he has to remain still, silent, perceptive, clear, alert, aware, and then life becomes a celebration. So many flowers shower from the beyond that it is impossible to count them, as if the whole infinity starts failing upon you.\nKabir has a very beautiful statement. He says, \"When meditation happened for the first time, I thought,\n'The dewdrop has slipped into the ocean' -- that was my first contact with meditation, as if the dewdrop had slipped into the ocean. But as I became more and more accustomed to the experience, I had to change my statement. Finally I discovered that it is just vice versa: the ocean has slipped into the dewdrop.\"\nBoth are true. You can say the dewdrop has slipped into the ocean -- that is the experience of the beginner; you can say the ocean has slipped into the dewdrop -\n- that is the experience of the siddha, of one who has arrived.\nBut the beginning is the end, because the beginning contains the end. The first step is also the last step.\nMa Dhyana means meditation. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is a state of no-mind, of no-thought, of no-desire, of no-dream. Looked from the outside it is absolutely empty -- empty of all that you were clinging to, empty to all that you were full of -- but looked from the other side, from the other end, it is overflowing, over-full. But over-full and overflowing with things you have never even dreamt about: blissfulness, truthfulness, authenticity, freedom, love, godliness.\nThousand and one flowers go on blossoming and their fragrance is so much that one cannot contain it; it has to be shared. It starts reaching to others on its own accord. You have not even to share it, it shares itself.\nThe sannyasin has to do the first part, emptying, and existence does the second part, filling. You have to empty yourself of all junk that we are cluttered with. It is certainly junk, rubbish. Everybody is clinging to garbage. People love garbage! (Laughter). Because they don't know the real treasures so they accumulate colored stones, seashells on the seashore and they think they are collecting something immensely valuable.\nWhat is there in our thoughts, what is there in our desires? Everybody has those thoughts, everybody has those desires, everybody has those ambitions -- they are so ordinary. And not only today; since man has existed he has not changed. It seems evolution stopped the day monkeys turned into man. Since then there has been no evolution. Nothing has happened to prove that man has grown. Not only that but seeing man so stuck even monkeys have stopped becoming man; since then no monkey has tried to become man either.\nThat's very strange! (Laughter).\nThey get the idea that it is foolish to become man because everything stops. And I don't think they think that man has a higher status. It is impossible for them to think that. They must be giggling that man has fallen, and in a way literally he has fallen -- from the trees, on the ground. What kind of evolution is this?\nChristians may have got the idea from the monkeys: the original fall. Adam and Eve used to live in trees it seems -- in the Garden of Eden but in the trees. And expulsion from the Garden of Eden simply means they have been thrown from the trees and it seems multiple fractures happened, and they have not been able to go back to the trees, so they are consoling themselves that \"We are evolved beings,\" but just fight with a monkey and you will know who is more powerful.\nSince man has existed he has been carrying the same stupid desires, the same ugly ambitions, the same stinking ego. A sannyasin has to decide that enough is enough, that \"I will throw all this nonsense out.\"\nThe first part has to be done by you and the second part comes as a grace of god. It is the reward: you empty yourself, clean the place, make it ready for the gift and the gift inevitably comes! And once you know the gift then you understand how ridiculous you have been before, because whatsoever you were collecting was simply useless; not only useless but a positive hindrance for this immense gift; the gift of immortality, the gift of eternal life, the gift of a constant flow of\nblissfulness, the gift of consciousness. And when you are absolutely empty and your whole being becomes full of consciousness, that's what sannyas is all about: to help you to become so full of consciousness, so full of light, so full of love, that you start feeling that nothing is missing, that a tremendous contentment descends over you, that life becomes a relaxed, restful experience, as if one has come home -- a home that he has been searching for centuries.\nHow long you will be here?\n- It's open.\nThat's good. Keep it open forever! Right? Good! Never close it!\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Sunando. Dhyan means meditation, Sunando means blissfulness.\nEverybody is seeking bliss and only very few people have found it. Life is miserable for the simple reason because everybody seeks bliss and never finds it. That not finding it creates misery, frustration, failure, a sense of unworthiness, futility, meaninglessness. But the reason why we are not able to find bliss is not that we don't seek it, we seek it in wrong direction. In fact we go everything, we do everything which prevents bliss.\nWe always go against the current and sooner or later we become tired, exhausted. Why we go against the current? -- Because ego can exist only if we go against the current and ego is the enemy of bliss.\nBliss happens in a state of let-go, but let-go simply means the death of the ego. So one has to choose. if one chooses the ego then one chooses misery -- that is part of it, you cannot separate them. If you choose blissfulness you have to choose let-go -- They are two sides of the same coin -- but then ego cannot exist.\nAnd the problem that man has created for himself is that he wants to do the impossible: he want the ego and also blissfulness, he want to eat the cake and save it too, and then he is in a difficulty. If he eats he is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmiserable -- the cake is gone; if he saves he is continuously hungry... and the smell of the cake, and the so closeness of the cake, that the whole time he is oppressed, the whole time he is looking at the cake, but he knows if he eats it is gone and he wants to have both.\nIt is not possible, simply not possible; seeing this impossibility things become very clear: either have it then forget about eating it, or eat it and forget about having it. And my suggestion is eat it! Because what is the point of having it? If you are never going to eat it, somebody else will eat it. You will starve to death and somebody will enjoy your cake. So before somebody else snatches it away, eat it quickly -- don't waste time -- because who knows about the next moment? You may not be here. You may not be capable to eat, you may have some stomach trouble. All kinds of things are possible.\nSo I tell to my sannyasins whenever you have the cake to eat it; if you don't have, eat somebody else because the fools who are saving it, they are saving for you! Somebody else will eat it, so why not you?\nMeditation simply means the art of eating the cake! So start -- don't wait!\nHow long you will be here (Three days)\nSo eat your cake and if you can find somebody else saving, finish it. And back home you will find many people saving it. Here it may be difficult, almost impossible. People have eaten their own... and be careful!\nSomebody may eat it. Somebody may have already eaten it! That's the whole trick: they send you to take sannyas and they will be eating your cake! So be intelligent.\nThree days -- that's actually the whole life, just three days: childhood, youth, old age -- and the cake is gone! And come back again.\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyan Anugraha. Dhyan means meditation, Anugraha\nmeans gratitude.\nI know only one kind of prayer and that is the prayer of the heart, with no words\n-- because the heart knows no language -- but the heart can show its gratitude in absolute silence. Gratitude to the existence or to god or to truth, whatsoever name one prefers -- these are just names for the same reality., Hence all the prayers that go on in the temples and churches and synagogues are not true prayers; they are just desires of the mind, parading as prayers. Everybody is asking for somebody.\nNobody is grateful, nobody has gone there to say thank you. In fact if you want to say thank you there is no need to go to the church or wait for Sunday. You can do it every moment. it is only a question of undercurrent thankfulness; just like breathing: you don't wait for Sunday, even while asleep you are breathing.\nSo is the case with real gratitude: even while asleep one is grateful. But this gratefulness, this prayer comes only through meditation. It is the by-product of meditation. One has just to be silent, aware, relaxed, then all your perceptions become clear, all your senses become sensitive. Your eyes for the first time see and your ears for the first time hear: your hands for the first time touch.\nThere is immense difference... Bring a painter into the garden; he will see hundreds of green colours because each tree has a different shade of green, but only a painter has that sensitivity, that subtle sensitivity which can see the difference between two subtle shades of the green.\nOrdinarily people will come and they will see only green, all trees are green. Eyes can be so sensitive that you can start feeling god in everything. God is present in everything; god is not a person but only a presence -- in the flowers, in the stars, in the birds, in the rivers, in people, in you, in everything. Even in a rock god is fast asleep. If you have the capacity to feel the texture of the rock, the warmth of the rock, you will be surprised: it responds.\nBut to understand its response you have to be very sensitive. Meditation releases all your sensitivities. It makes you aware of god and all the gifts that god has given -- and then naturally there is gratitude.\nI call that gratitude the only authentic prayer. That gratitude is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan -- it cannot be. Gratitude is simply gratitude. One's whole being wants to shout to existence\n'Thank you!' And the moment this really happens, not just a parrotlike repetition of a prayer but when it comes out of your meditation, an explosion of you heart, it transforms not only you but the whole world in which you had lived up to now, because now you can see much more into it, deeper into it, to the very core of it, and you are surprised: everywhere god is, in millions of forms.\nAll are manifestations... then this very world is paradise then one has not to go anywhere else.\nThis is your name: swami Dhyan Lalit. Dhyan means meditation. Lalit means beautiful, graceful.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation brings immense beauty to the person, infinite grace, and a beauty which is not something painted on the surface, a beauty which has nothing to do with the body, a beauty that radiates from the very centre of your being.\nOf course the body is also transformed by it: it becomes luminous. The body also becomes surrounded by a light aura, but that is secondary. The most important thing is to reach to your centre. The moment you reach to your centre many things suddenly start happening, as if you touched the right spot and triggered a revolution.\nBeauty, bliss, benediction, love, compassion, service, freedom, truth, sincerity -- they all come rushing towards you. You need not cultivate them, because anything cultivated is always phony. They come naturally, spontaneously.\nLalit means that spontaneous grace, that natural beauty, that is known only by the meditators and by nobody else.\nNirvana now or never Chapter #22\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3190","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/>Nirvana Now Or Never</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3190 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nirvana_Now_Or_Never/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

seem to be part of this world.</p><p>Suddenly you are transported to a fairyland. It is so beautiful that
it is almost unbelievable.</p><p>I lived in one place, Jabalpur, for twenty years. Near Jabalpur there
is one miracle of nature. I don't think there exists anywhere in the
world anything comparable to it -- it is just unique. The river Narmada
flows between two mountains of marble; for at least four or five miles
it flows between two mountains of marble.</p><p>It is a rare thing. And in the full-moon night when you enter, in a
boat, inside that world, suddenly another dimension of life... As if God
is real and the world is unreal, as if dreams are real and matter is
unreal.</p><p>I took one of my teachers of philosophy -- he was a lover of nature
so I invited him and took him; he was an old man. I took him to the
marble rocks. When he saw them he said, "Take the boat very close. I
want to touch and feel whether they really exist or you are playing a
trick." He said to me, "I have heard that you</p><p>can hypnotize people. Don't do such tricks on an old man like me. And
at least be respectful to me -- I have been your teacher in the
university. Take me very close."</p><p>I took him very close to the mountains; he had to touch them to
believe them. Actually that is the case: unless you touch them you
cannot believe. It seems so much a dreamland.</p><p>The statues of Buddha were carved in pure white marble in the
beginning, just to show that this earth can have something of the
beyond. And the shape of the Buddha statue is so symmetrical that one
can see the balance, that everything is balanced. He talked about
meditation as the middle way, majjhim nikaya..</p><p>Meditation is really the golden mean, neither leaning to the right
too much nor to the left too much, remaining exactly in the middle of
all the extremes of life.</p><p>There is success and there is failure, and there is richness and
there is poverty, and one day you are full of life and one day slips out
of your hands. There is respect and there is insult. Life consists of
polar opposites. The man of meditation walks exactly in the middle;
neither success excites him nor failure depresses him. He remains
absolutely untouched -- that is his symmetry, that is his balance, and
that balance you will see in the statue of Buddha.</p><p>Buddha's eyes in the statue are half-closed and half-open. The
meditator should not close his eyes completely towards the outer,
because that too is our reality. And he should not open his eyes too
much so that he has nothing left for the inner world.</p><p>Half-closed eyes represent that one is standing just in between,
available to both the worlds: the objective and the subjective, with no
division, with no judgement. He will live in the world but will not be
of the world.</p><p>And this whole thing is the meaning of your name, Dhyanmurti. Create
a golden mean in your life, create balance, symmetry, create a synthesis
of all the conflicting elements within you so that they become pure
white, the summum bonum, the highest combination, of all the opposites,
so that they can become a cosmos instead of a chaos. Then one becomes an
image of meditation itself.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be an image, a living image of meditation, in his
moment-to- moment life. In his relationship to the world, to people, in
his relationship to</p><p>himself, while he is alone, when he is with people; in every kind of
situation he has to remain still, silent, perceptive, clear, alert,
aware, and then life becomes a celebration. So many flowers shower from
the beyond that it is impossible to count them, as if the whole infinity
starts failing upon you.</p><p>Kabir has a very beautiful statement. He says, "When meditation
happened for the first time, I thought,</p><p>'The dewdrop has slipped into the ocean' -- that was my first contact
with meditation, as if the dewdrop had slipped into the ocean. But as I
became more and more accustomed to the experience, I had to change my
statement. Finally I discovered that it is just vice versa: the ocean
has slipped into the dewdrop."</p><p>Both are true. You can say the dewdrop has slipped into the ocean --
that is the experience of the beginner; you can say the ocean has
slipped into the dewdrop -</p><p>- that is the experience of the siddha, of one who has arrived.</p><p>But the beginning is the end, because the beginning contains the end.
The first step is also the last step.</p><p>Ma Dhyana means meditation. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Meditation is a state of no-mind, of no-thought, of no-desire, of
no-dream. Looked from the outside it is absolutely empty -- empty of all
that you were clinging to, empty to all that you were full of -- but
looked from the other side, from the other end, it is overflowing,
over-full. But over-full and overflowing with things you have never even
dreamt about: blissfulness, truthfulness, authenticity, freedom, love,
godliness.</p><p>Thousand and one flowers go on blossoming and their fragrance is so
much that one cannot contain it; it has to be shared. It starts reaching
to others on its own accord. You have not even to share it, it shares
itself.</p><p>The sannyasin has to do the first part, emptying, and existence does
the second part, filling. You have to empty yourself of all junk that we
are cluttered with. It is certainly junk, rubbish. Everybody is clinging
to garbage. People love garbage! (Laughter). Because they don't know the
real treasures so they accumulate colored stones, seashells on the
seashore and they think they are collecting something immensely
valuable.</p><p>What is there in our thoughts, what is there in our desires?
Everybody has those thoughts, everybody has those desires, everybody has
those ambitions -- they are so ordinary. And not only today; since man
has existed he has not changed. It seems evolution stopped the day
monkeys turned into man. Since then there has been no evolution. Nothing
has happened to prove that man has grown. Not only that but seeing man
so stuck even monkeys have stopped becoming man; since then no monkey
has tried to become man either.</p><p>That's very strange! (Laughter).</p><p>They get the idea that it is foolish to become man because everything
stops. And I don't think they think that man has a higher status. It is
impossible for them to think that. They must be giggling that man has
fallen, and in a way literally he has fallen -- from the trees, on the
ground. What kind of evolution is this?</p><p>Christians may have got the idea from the monkeys: the original fall.
Adam and Eve used to live in trees it seems -- in the Garden of Eden but
in the trees. And expulsion from the Garden of Eden simply means they
have been thrown from the trees and it seems multiple fractures
happened, and they have not been able to go back to the trees, so they
are consoling themselves that "We are evolved beings," but just fight
with a monkey and you will know who is more powerful.</p><p>Since man has existed he has been carrying the same stupid desires,
the same ugly ambitions, the same stinking ego. A sannyasin has to
decide that enough is enough, that "I will throw all this nonsense
out."</p><p>The first part has to be done by you and the second part comes as a
grace of god. It is the reward: you empty yourself, clean the place,
make it ready for the gift and the gift inevitably comes! And once you
know the gift then you understand how ridiculous you have been before,
because whatsoever you were collecting was simply useless; not only
useless but a positive hindrance for this immense gift; the gift of
immortality, the gift of eternal life, the gift of a constant flow
of</p><p>blissfulness, the gift of consciousness. And when you are absolutely
empty and your whole being becomes full of consciousness, that's what
sannyas is all about: to help you to become so full of consciousness, so
full of light, so full of love, that you start feeling that nothing is
missing, that a tremendous contentment descends over you, that life
becomes a relaxed, restful experience, as if one has come home -- a home
that he has been searching for centuries.</p><p>How long you will be here?</p><p>- It's open.</p><p>That's good. Keep it open forever! Right? Good! Never close it!</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Sunando. Dhyan means meditation,
Sunando means blissfulness.</p><p>Everybody is seeking bliss and only very few people have found it.
Life is miserable for the simple reason because everybody seeks bliss
and never finds it. That not finding it creates misery, frustration,
failure, a sense of unworthiness, futility, meaninglessness. But the
reason why we are not able to find bliss is not that we don't seek it,
we seek it in wrong direction. In fact we go everything, we do
everything which prevents bliss.</p><p>We always go against the current and sooner or later we become tired,
exhausted. Why we go against the current? -- Because ego can exist only
if we go against the current and ego is the enemy of bliss.</p><p>Bliss happens in a state of let-go, but let-go simply means the death
of the ego. So one has to choose. if one chooses the ego then one
chooses misery -- that is part of it, you cannot separate them. If you
choose blissfulness you have to choose let-go -- They are two sides of
the same coin -- but then ego cannot exist.</p><p>And the problem that man has created for himself is that he wants to
do the impossible: he want the ego and also blissfulness, he want to eat
the cake and save it too, and then he is in a difficulty. If he eats he
is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

hungry... and the smell of the cake, and the so closeness of the cake,
that the whole time he is oppressed, the whole time he is looking at the
cake, but he knows if he eats it is gone and he wants to have both.</p><p>It is not possible, simply not possible; seeing this impossibility
things become very clear: either have it then forget about eating it, or
eat it and forget about having it. And my suggestion is eat it! Because
what is the point of having it? If you are never going to eat it,
somebody else will eat it. You will starve to death and somebody will
enjoy your cake. So before somebody else snatches it away, eat it
quickly -- don't waste time -- because who knows about the next moment?
You may not be here. You may not be capable to eat, you may have some
stomach trouble. All kinds of things are possible.</p><p>So I tell to my sannyasins whenever you have the cake to eat it; if
you don't have, eat somebody else because the fools who are saving it,
they are saving for you! Somebody else will eat it, so why not you?</p><p>Meditation simply means the art of eating the cake! So start -- don't
wait!</p><p>How long you will be here (Three days)</p><p>So eat your cake and if you can find somebody else saving, finish it.
And back home you will find many people saving it. Here it may be
difficult, almost impossible. People have eaten their own... and be
careful!</p><p>Somebody may eat it. Somebody may have already eaten it! That's the
whole trick: they send you to take sannyas and they will be eating your
cake! So be intelligent.</p><p>Three days -- that's actually the whole life, just three days:
childhood, youth, old age -- and the cake is gone! And come back
again.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Dhyan Anugraha. Dhyan means meditation,
Anugraha</p><p>means gratitude.</p><p>I know only one kind of prayer and that is the prayer of the heart,
with no words</p><p>-- because the heart knows no language -- but the heart can show its
gratitude in absolute silence. Gratitude to the existence or to god or
to truth, whatsoever name one prefers -- these are just names for the
same reality., Hence all the prayers that go on in the temples and
churches and synagogues are not true prayers; they are just desires of
the mind, parading as prayers. Everybody is asking for somebody.</p><p>Nobody is grateful, nobody has gone there to say thank you. In fact
if you want to say thank you there is no need to go to the church or
wait for Sunday. You can do it every moment. it is only a question of
undercurrent thankfulness; just like breathing: you don't wait for
Sunday, even while asleep you are breathing.</p><p>So is the case with real gratitude: even while asleep one is
grateful. But this gratefulness, this prayer comes only through
meditation. It is the by-product of meditation. One has just to be
silent, aware, relaxed, then all your perceptions become clear, all your
senses become sensitive. Your eyes for the first time see and your ears
for the first time hear: your hands for the first time touch.</p><p>There is immense difference... Bring a painter into the garden; he
will see hundreds of green colours because each tree has a different
shade of green, but only a painter has that sensitivity, that subtle
sensitivity which can see the difference between two subtle shades of
the green.</p><p>Ordinarily people will come and they will see only green, all trees
are green. Eyes can be so sensitive that you can start feeling god in
everything. God is present in everything; god is not a person but only a
presence -- in the flowers, in the stars, in the birds, in the rivers,
in people, in you, in everything. Even in a rock god is fast asleep. If
you have the capacity to feel the texture of the rock, the warmth of the
rock, you will be surprised: it responds.</p><p>But to understand its response you have to be very sensitive.
Meditation releases all your sensitivities. It makes you aware of god
and all the gifts that god has given -- and then naturally there is
gratitude.</p><p>I call that gratitude the only authentic prayer. That gratitude is
neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan -- it cannot be. Gratitude is
simply gratitude. One's whole being wants to shout to existence</p><p>'Thank you!' And the moment this <em>really</em> happens, not just a
parrotlike repetition of a prayer but when it comes out of your
meditation, an explosion of you heart, it transforms not only you but
the whole world in which you had lived up to now, because now you can
see much more into it, deeper into it, to the very core of it, and you
are surprised: everywhere god is, in millions of forms.</p><p>All are manifestations... then this very world is paradise then one
has not to go anywhere else.</p><p>This is your name: swami Dhyan Lalit. Dhyan means meditation. Lalit
means beautiful, graceful.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

beauty which is not something painted on the surface, a beauty which has
nothing to do with the body, a beauty that radiates from the very centre
of your being.</p><p>Of course the body is also transformed by it: it becomes luminous.
The body also becomes surrounded by a light aura, but that is secondary.
The most important thing is to reach to your centre. The moment you
reach to your centre many things suddenly start happening, as if you
touched the right spot and triggered a revolution.</p><p>Beauty, bliss, benediction, love, compassion, service, freedom,
truth, sincerity -- they all come rushing towards you. You need not
cultivate them, because anything cultivated is always phony. They come
naturally, spontaneously.</p><p>Lalit means that spontaneous grace, that natural beauty, that is
known only by the meditators and by nobody else.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #22</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

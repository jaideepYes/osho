It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Gloria.\nAnand means bliss. Gloria means glory, glorious.\nMan is born with a potential to be blissful but it is only a potential. Unless one works upon it, it never becomes actual. it is only a seed, with great possibilities, with many flowers, but they are not yet real. They exist in the invisible; they have to be brought into the world of visibility, tangibility.\nVery few people make any effort to transform their potential into reality. The reason is they think that this is what life is all about. They take it for granted that birth is the beginning of an opportunity in which life is possible but only if you work for it, if you make efforts towards it, if you dig deep into your being.\nThe seeds needs a soil, a certain climate. In the same way man deeds a certain soil, a certain climate, a certain methodology, a certain art, to blossom. And the moment one blossoms there is bliss, fulfillment, contentment, and simultaneously there is glory, otherwise people only live an undignified life with no glory, but only guilt. They live in darkness, they live closed, and nobody else is responsible except themselves.\nYou can carry a flute your whole life without playing upon it, you can have the most beautiful musical instrument with you, but you will have to learn the art to play it, otherwise it is an unnecessary burden. The same thing that can become a glory can also become just a burden -- and that's what is happening to millions of people: their potential is like a mountainous burden for them -- they would like to get rid of it, not knowing its hidden treasures. Sannyas means the beginning of the effort towards transformation, a commitment, an involvement, a decision, a resolution, that \"I will make every possible effort to know my hiddenmost core, to discover my kingdom of god.\"\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your name: Swami Satyabhakta. Satyabhakta means devoted only to the truth.\nPeople are living in lies. Of course those lies are beautiful, comfortable, convenient, they give a certain consolation. But lies are lies after all; they cannot help. They function like opium. They can help to forget the misery, they can be used as tranquilizers, but they are not really going to change the real disease. They only hide the symptoms.\nAnd millions of people in the world have lived according to convenient lies. They call them truths, they have to call them truth. If they know that it is a lie then it is impossible to live with it. They insist it is truth, but the basic quality of truth is that it has to be your own discovery.\nTruth is not transferable; nobody can give it to you. You have to discover it by your own effort. Hence whatsoever one gets from others can at the most a beautiful lie, a nice, sweet lie. And one can surround oneself with sweet nothings, but this is a dangerous game, because one is losing the opportunity, the time, the energy, which could have made the world of truth available to you.\nDevotion to truth means: \"Now, I will not belong to any tradition, I will not\nbelong to any cult, any creed; I will inquire. I will believe only when I know -- not before that.\"\nUnless you decide this, truth remains far away. The moment the decision settles in your heart, it is not far away; then you just have to remove a few cobwebs, that's all. It is a simple phenomenon: a little dust has to be removed from the mirror and it immediately reflects the real.\nA sannyasin does not belong to any religion, does not belong to any philosophy, does not belong to any dogma, any church. He simply belongs to the inquiry, to the only god -- the truth -- whatsoever the cost.\nEven if one has to lose one's life for it, it is worth it, because this life is going to be lost anyway. It is already going down the drain. Every moment death is coming closer and life is disappearing. Losing it is inevitable, so if you can lose it on the way to truth, it is worth it. Once you know the truth, you know eternal life, you know that which begins and ends never.\nAnd that should be the only devotion, the only surrender. So let your name become a reality. Good.\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Dhyan.\nAnand means bliss. Dhyan means meditation.\nMan has been concerned with meditation for thousands of years. Man has also been concerned about bliss, since the very beginning if there was any beginning ever, but somehow either a man has tried towards the goal of bliss or towards the goal of meditation. The reason is clear why it happened: they became either/or, they became alternatives. Somehow it became settled is human mind that both cannot be possible together. It did not happen accidentally, I can see the reason why it did happen: it is easier to be meditative if you forget about blissfulness; one can be silent, one can be calm and quiet, because blissfulness has a certain element of excitement.\nIt is a beautiful turmoil, it is a beautiful chaos. It has something passionate in it. It disturbs the so-called silence, the calmness, the quietness, the equilibrium.\nBliss brings dance in, it brings songs in, it brings celebration in, and the silent person feels distracted, He wants to go to the desert, to the monasteries, to the\nmountains so that there is no distraction -- and bliss seems to be one of the most powerful distractions, very magnetic, very tempting. So it was easier to drop the whole idea of bliss and just settle with the idea of silence. And the same was true for the other alternative: the people who decided to be blissful, who were not ready to drop the joys, the pleasures, the excitements, the sensations of life, who were not ready to renounce the beauty, love who were tremendously interested in creativity, in music, in poetry, they decides that it is better not to bother about silence, because silence becomes a distraction from the goal of bliss.\nIt was easier to follow one, so whichever one has chosen, one has chosen it against the other -- and this became a calamity, because bliss without silence is feverish. Yes, there is excitement but it is tiring, there is no real nourishment in it. Bliss without silence sooner or later exhausts one, makes one utterly fed up.\nThe man who has been seeking only bliss and avoiding meditativeness may end up in suicide, because sooner or later he has experienced all the joys and then they become repetitive and repetition brings boredom. Then there is no excitement and when you are enjoying many joys you start getting fed up, because from where you can find new sensations every day? And all those joys create stress, strain, tension; they keep you always in a state of fever, an inner trembling. It cannot be prolonged for long One starts 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthinking \"It is better to finish this whole game.\" One starts seeing the utter futility of it.\nAnd the people who have chosen to be silent without bliss start becoming more and more dull and dead, stale, stagnant. Their life juices are no more flowing, they are no more rivers; they have become muddy ponds, very limited, closed, afraid, always afraid -- afraid because they have renounced joys and whatsoever you have renounced becomes more attractive. they have repressed their desire for pleasure, and whatsoever is repressed comes again and again, asserts again and again. That's why the saints, the so-called saints are so much tempted by devil.\nThere is no devil at all. I have searched everywhere (laughter) -- I have not found any devil. Because I never did the basic thing in which you are bound to find the devil: I never repressed. It is repression that becomes devil. If you repress then the temptation, if you repress the desire for anything then that desire remains inside you. You can force it for a time-being but you cannot force it forever, because to keep it repressed energy is needed - you start getting tired. Sometimes you need rest and when you are resting the repressed desire starts uncoiling like a serpent. Hence the serpent became the symbol of the devil; it is significant that it was the serpent who seduced Adam and Eve in the beginning.\nSerpent represents the repressed, coiled energy. You have forced it, it is there in the unconscious. The moment you rest, relax-that's why the saints cannot go for a holiday, the saints cannot have a holiday. They have to be twenty-four hours, seven days a week, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year, on guard, because that serpent is there- they know -- they are keeping it down, holding it down. And it is wriggling and it wants to come up and they know, if they go to the Blue Diamond it will come! (much laughter) If they go to the swimming pool it will come. They have to remain hidden in a cave so no opportunity, but still it is there.\nWhether you allow it to come or not it is there, and this constant conflict makes the saint look miserable.\nThis is a wrestling with oneself, this too is tiring, this too is exhausting, this too is a strain; hence the silence that the saint achieves is not very valuable. It is the silence of the cemetery, silence of the dead person. Of course a dead corpse is silent, but corpse cannot laugh, cannot even smile, cannot do anything; they are utterly silent.\nThe saint is living in a grave. His whole life becomes his grave. The man who runs after pleasure comes to the same end, but a little late, to the state of suicide. The question arises sooner or later; now what is there left? I have experienced everything, I have known every joy -- now there is nothing else, it will be only repetition -- so why go on living? For what?\nAnd the man who is living the life of a meditator from the very beginning starts committing suicide, slow suicide. Withdrawal means slow suicide, renunciation means slow suicide. In separation, meditation and bliss both lead to a suicidal state. My sannyasins have not to choose between the two. It is not a question of\neither-or; both-and. Both have to be lived together.\nIt is hard, it is arduous, it is a challenge, but worth accepting. It is an adventure, in fact the greatest adventure there is: to live both, to be blissful silently, to be silently blissfully. Only then a human being knows what wholeness is, only then one comes to know life in its totality, only then you have both the wings and you can fly into the sky towards the stars. With one wing no bird can fly!\nYes, he can try, flutter a little bit, jog, jump (laughter), but he will fall back, he will hurt himself. One wing is not enough to fly. Two wings are needed, and remember, both the wings spread in opposite directions... but they are not contradictory, apparently they are, spreading into polar opposites as if they are against each other, but that is only appearance. Deep down they are complementary, helping each other.\nMy sannyasins have to achieve this synthesis between meditation and bliss. And this synthesis is going to become the foundation of a new religiousness in the whole world, in the coming future of humanity.\nAll old religions have lived with the religion -- they were split. Epicurus had chosen bliss but he is against meditation. Buddha has chosen meditation but he is against bliss. My effort here is to bring together both, because I see there is something beautiful in Epicurus which is missing in Buddha and there is something beautiful in Buddha which is missing in Epicurus. Both are complementary, not contradictory; both can become two wings, and they should be made two wings.\nYour name precisely defines my approach, my whole philosophia, my vision, how a man can be total: blissful silence, silent bliss!\nThis is your name: Ma Veet Nitam. Veet means transcendence, going beyond. Nitam means morality, puritanism.\nThese two words have to be understood deeply: One is 'conscience', and the other is 'consciousness'.\nConscience represents morality, consciousness represents religion. Conscience is a social strategy. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncreated by others, it is a trick to manipulate the person. Conscience means others have told you what is right and what is wrong; they have not given an opportunity to you to explore, to know, to experiment. They have not given you freedom to judge on your own. They have given you fixed ideas, ready-made answers, ten commandments.\nMorality is given by others from the outside. It is not an inner growth; because it is not an inner growth it remains like a plastic flower. You can hang the plastic flower on the rose bush -- maybe it can deceive a few fools, but it cannot deceive the rose bush. It cannot deceive the bees and the butterflies, and certainly it cannot deceive you, because you have planted those false, phony flowers on the rose bush.\nConscience is a plastic flower, planted by others -- the society, the church, the state. Consciousness is your inner growth; it is a real rose, alive, unfolding, fragrant, each moment growing, breathing. It has a beauty, because it has life, and it is yours, authentically yours. It is not borrowed. Everything borrowed is always ugly. The borrowed becomes a burden on your head; it cannot allow you freedom, it can only repress you, oppress you, exploit you. Morality is being used for psychological slavery. Other kinds of slavery have disappeared from the world, but the psychological slavery still exists, in fact more so than before, because before there were many other kinds of slaveries available; now there is only one kind of slavery available and that is psychological. So the people who want to exploit -- all their efforts have become concentrated on a single point and that is psychological exploitation.\nSo every child is being programmed by the society, given fixed ideas, what is right, what is wrong, and this is utterly absurd. Something may be right today and may not be right tomorrow, something may be wrong this moment and may not be wrong the next moment. Life continuously goes on changing, it is a flux, it is a constant movement, nothing is static; hence no static answers can be of any help. All static answers will prevent you in seeing the reality and responding spontaneously to that which is.\nConsciousness helps you to become responsible, and I am not using the word\n'responsible' in the sense of dutiful, etcetera. I use the word 'responsible' in the literal sense: the capacity to respond.\nThe man who is burdened with conscience has no capacity to respond, he only reacts. Before the question is there he already has an answer. His answer will never fit the question because the question is always new. Even if the question appears the same it cannot be the same because the context is different, the situation is different, the whole reference is different -- and you have to be very alive, unprejudiced, you have to be just like a mirror, reflecting whatsoever is the case and responding accordingly, not according to a preconceived idea.\nMorality is a phony lie, because the ideas are given by others and you are living them -- you are just an imitator. I am against all morality -- that does not mean that I am for immorality. In fact it is morality that creates immorality too. I am for transcendence, transcendence of the very idea of morality -- and of course, this implies immorality too.\nI am for consciousness, not for conscience. I don't want to give you any shoulds or should nots. I simply want you to become more aware, alert, watchful, clear, unclouded. When you are like a flame without smoke, whatsoever you do will be right. In a state of clarity the wrong is impossible, but then your character comes from your consciousness, not from your conscience, then it comes from yourself. Then it is a real rose, growing out of your being, and everything real has a beauty -- it has a fragrance.\nJesus was not moral, that's why he was crucified. He did not follow the old idea given by the society. He started living on his own, he was an individual, a rebel. Socrates was not moral, that was his crime. The society could not forgive him.\nNo authentic person has ever been moral in that sense; although in another sense only those few authentic people have been really moral, but then you have to write the word 'moral' with inverted commas.\nIt is a totally different thing, it is not the so-called 'morality'. Authentic people's morality comes from their consciousness; hence they never feel the puritan's ego. You can never see in their eyes the holier-than-thou look, you can never see in them any condemnation for anybody. They have immense respect, even for those who are fast asleep and snoring, because they know that once, they too were sleeping and they too were snoring, and if they can awake, others also can\nawake.\nThe moment a person becomes awakened, becomes a buddha, he knows that everybody has the potential of being a buddha, and he becomes tremendously respectful to the buddhahood of everybody -- awake or asleep it doesn't matter -- buddhahood is buddhahood!\nSo I teach you buddhahood, awareness, awakening, but I don't give you any discipline. And that is my revolution. Religions have given only conscience, and that's how they all have cheated human beings. They have created hypocrites, they have also created a very schizophrenic humanity, a mad world. The people 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwho are responsible for all this insanity are your so-called saints, sages, mahatmas.\nI am against all this nonsense. My approach is very simple and clear-cut. I give you a single key but it is a master key; it unlocks all the doors: Be aware! Be more and more aware. Bring that moment closer and closer when you can feel that your whole being is full of awareness. When there is not even a single spot inside you which is dark, unconscious -- then you have come home.\nThis is the goal of sannyas: to be enlightened, to be fully aware and full of light.\nNirvana now or never Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3241","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/>Nirvana Now Or Never</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3241 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nirvana_Now_Or_Never/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

to the truth.</p><p>People are living in lies. Of course those lies are beautiful,
comfortable, convenient, they give a certain consolation. But lies are
lies after all; they cannot help. They function like opium. They can
help to forget the misery, they can be used as tranquilizers, but they
are not really going to change the real disease. They only hide the
symptoms.</p><p>And millions of people in the world have lived according to
convenient lies. They call them truths, they have to call them truth. If
they know that it is a lie then it is impossible to live with it. They
insist it is truth, but the basic quality of truth is that it has to be
your own discovery.</p><p>Truth is not transferable; nobody can give it to you. You have to
discover it by your own effort. Hence whatsoever one gets from others
can at the most a beautiful lie, a nice, sweet lie. And one can surround
oneself with sweet nothings, but this is a dangerous game, because one
is losing the opportunity, the time, the energy, which could have made
the world of truth available to you.</p><p>Devotion to truth means: "Now, I will not belong to any tradition, I
will not</p><p>belong to any cult, any creed; I will inquire. I will believe only
when I know -- not before that."</p><p>Unless you decide this, truth remains far away. The moment the
decision settles in your heart, it is not far away; then you just have
to remove a few cobwebs, that's all. It is a simple phenomenon: a little
dust has to be removed from the mirror and it immediately reflects the
real.</p><p>A sannyasin does not belong to any religion, does not belong to any
philosophy, does not belong to any dogma, any church. He simply belongs
to the inquiry, to the only god -- the truth -- whatsoever the cost.</p><p>Even if one has to lose one's life for it, it is worth it, because
this life is going to be lost anyway. It is already going down the
drain. Every moment death is coming closer and life is disappearing.
Losing it is inevitable, so if you can lose it on the way to truth, it
is worth it. Once you know the truth, you know eternal life, you know
that which begins and ends never.</p><p>And that should be the only devotion, the only surrender. So let your
name become a reality. Good.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anand Dhyan.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Dhyan means meditation.</p><p>Man has been concerned with meditation for thousands of years. Man
has also been concerned about bliss, since the very beginning if there
was any beginning ever, but somehow either a man has tried towards the
goal of bliss or towards the goal of meditation. The reason is clear why
it happened: they became either/or, they became alternatives. Somehow it
became settled is human mind that both cannot be possible together. It
did not happen accidentally, I can see the reason why it did happen: it
is easier to be meditative if you forget about blissfulness; one can be
silent, one can be calm and quiet, because blissfulness has a certain
element of excitement.</p><p>It is a beautiful turmoil, it is a beautiful chaos. It has something
passionate in it. It disturbs the so-called silence, the calmness, the
quietness, the equilibrium.</p><p>Bliss brings dance in, it brings songs in, it brings celebration in,
and the silent person feels distracted, He wants to go to the desert, to
the monasteries, to the</p><p>mountains so that there is no distraction -- and bliss seems to be
one of the most powerful distractions, very magnetic, very tempting. So
it was easier to drop the whole idea of bliss and just settle with the
idea of silence. And the same was true for the other alternative: the
people who decided to be blissful, who were not ready to drop the joys,
the pleasures, the excitements, the sensations of life, who were not
ready to renounce the beauty, love who were tremendously interested in
creativity, in music, in poetry, they decides that it is better not to
bother about silence, because silence becomes a distraction from the
goal of bliss.</p><p>It was easier to follow one, so whichever one has chosen, one has
chosen it against the other -- and this became a calamity, because bliss
without silence is feverish. Yes, there is excitement but it is tiring,
there is no real nourishment in it. Bliss without silence sooner or
later exhausts one, makes one utterly fed up.</p><p>The man who has been seeking only bliss and avoiding meditativeness
may end up in suicide, because sooner or later he has experienced all
the joys and then they become repetitive and repetition brings boredom.
Then there is no excitement and when you are enjoying many joys you
start getting fed up, because from where you can find new sensations
every day? And all those joys create stress, strain, tension; they keep
you always in a state of fever, an inner trembling. It cannot be
prolonged for long One starts 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>thinking "It is better to finish this whole game." One starts seeing
the utter futility of it.</p><p>And the people who have chosen to be silent without bliss start
becoming more and more dull and dead, stale, stagnant. Their life juices
are no more flowing, they are no more rivers; they have become muddy
ponds, very limited, closed, afraid, always afraid -- afraid because
they have renounced joys and whatsoever you have renounced becomes more
attractive. they have repressed their desire for pleasure, and
whatsoever is repressed comes again and again, asserts again and again.
That's why the saints, the so-called saints are so much tempted by
devil.</p><p>There is no devil at all. I have searched everywhere (laughter) -- I
have not found any devil. Because I never did the basic thing in which
you are bound to find the devil: I never repressed. It is repression
that becomes devil. If you repress then the temptation, if you repress
the desire for anything then that desire remains inside you. You can
force it for a time-being but you cannot force it forever, because to
keep it repressed energy is needed - <em>you</em> start getting tired.
Sometimes you need rest and when you are resting the repressed desire
starts uncoiling like a serpent. Hence the serpent became the symbol of
the devil; it is significant that it was the serpent who seduced Adam
and Eve in the beginning.</p><p>Serpent represents the repressed, coiled energy. You have forced it,
it is there in the unconscious. The moment you rest, relax-that's why
the saints cannot go for a holiday, the saints cannot have a holiday.
They have to be twenty-four hours, seven days a week,
three-hundred-sixty-five days a year, on guard, because that serpent is
there- they know -- they are keeping it down, holding it down. And it is
wriggling and it wants to come up and they know, if they go to the Blue
Diamond it will come! (much laughter) If they go to the swimming pool it
will come. They have to remain hidden in a cave so no opportunity, but
still it is there.</p><p>Whether you allow it to come or not it is there, and this constant
conflict makes the saint look miserable.</p><p>This is a wrestling with oneself, this too is tiring, this too is
exhausting, this too is a strain; hence the silence that the saint
achieves is not very valuable. It is the silence of the cemetery,
silence of the dead person. Of course a dead corpse is silent, but
corpse cannot laugh, cannot even smile, cannot do anything; they are
utterly silent.</p><p>The saint is living in a grave. His whole life becomes his grave. The
man who runs after pleasure comes to the same end, but a little late, to
the state of suicide. The question arises sooner or later; now what is
there left? I have experienced everything, I have known every joy -- now
there is nothing else, it will be only repetition -- so why go on
living? For what?</p><p>And the man who is living the life of a meditator from the very
beginning starts committing suicide, <em>slow</em> suicide. Withdrawal
means slow suicide, renunciation means slow suicide. In separation,
meditation <em>and</em> bliss both lead to a suicidal state. My
sannyasins have not to choose between the two. It is not a question
of</p><p>either-or; both-and. Both have to be lived together.</p><p>It is hard, it is arduous, it is a challenge, but worth accepting. It
is an adventure, in fact the greatest adventure there is: to live both,
to be blissful silently, to be silently blissfully. Only then a human
being knows what wholeness is, only then one comes to know life in its
totality, only then you have both the wings and you can fly into the sky
towards the stars. With one wing no bird can fly!</p><p>Yes, he can try, flutter a little bit, jog, jump (laughter), but he
will fall back, he will hurt himself. One wing is not enough to fly. Two
wings are needed, and remember, both the wings spread in opposite
directions... but they are not contradictory, apparently they are,
spreading into polar opposites as if they are against each other, but
that is only appearance. Deep down they are complementary, helping each
other.</p><p>My sannyasins have to achieve this synthesis between meditation and
bliss. And this synthesis is going to become the foundation of a new
religiousness in the whole world, in the coming future of humanity.</p><p>All old religions have lived with the religion -- they were split.
Epicurus had chosen bliss but he is against meditation. Buddha has
chosen meditation but he is against bliss. My effort here is to bring
together both, because I see there is something beautiful in Epicurus
which is missing in Buddha and there is something beautiful in Buddha
which is missing in Epicurus. Both are complementary, not contradictory;
both can become two wings, and they <em>should</em> be made two
wings.</p><p>Your name precisely defines my approach, my whole philosophia, my
vision, how a man can be total: blissful silence, silent bliss!</p><p>This is your name: Ma Veet Nitam. Veet means transcendence, going
beyond. Nitam means morality, puritanism.</p><p>These two words have to be understood deeply: One is 'conscience',
and the other is 'consciousness'.</p><p>Conscience represents morality, consciousness represents religion.
Conscience is a social strategy. It is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>created by others, it is a trick to manipulate the person. Conscience
means others have told you what is right and what is wrong; they have
not given an opportunity to you to explore, to know, to experiment. They
have not given you freedom to judge on your own. They have given you
fixed ideas, ready-made answers, ten commandments.</p><p>Morality is given by others from the outside. It is not an inner
growth; because it is not an inner growth it remains like a plastic
flower. You can hang the plastic flower on the rose bush -- maybe it can
deceive a few fools, but it cannot deceive the rose bush. It cannot
deceive the bees and the butterflies, and certainly it cannot deceive
you, because you have planted those false, phony flowers on the rose
bush.</p><p>Conscience is a plastic flower, planted by others -- the society, the
church, the state. Consciousness is your inner growth; it is a real
rose, alive, unfolding, fragrant, each moment growing, breathing. It has
a beauty, because it has life, and it is yours, authentically yours. It
is not borrowed. Everything borrowed is always ugly. The borrowed
becomes a burden on your head; it cannot allow you freedom, it can only
repress you, oppress you, exploit you. Morality is being used for
psychological slavery. Other kinds of slavery have disappeared from the
world, but the psychological slavery still exists, in fact more so than
before, because before there were many other kinds of slaveries
available; now there is only one kind of slavery available and that is
psychological. So the people who want to exploit -- all their efforts
have become concentrated on a single point and that is psychological
exploitation.</p><p>So every child is being programmed by the society, given fixed ideas,
what is right, what is wrong, and this is utterly absurd. Something may
be right today and may not be right tomorrow, something may be wrong
this moment and may not be wrong the next moment. Life continuously goes
on changing, it is a flux, it is a constant movement, nothing is static;
hence no static answers can be of any help. All static answers will
prevent you in seeing the reality and responding spontaneously to that
which is.</p><p>Consciousness helps you to become responsible, and I am not using the
word</p><p>'responsible' in the sense of dutiful, etcetera. I use the word
'responsible' in the literal sense: the capacity to respond.</p><p>The man who is burdened with conscience has no capacity to respond,
he only reacts. Before the question is there he already has an answer.
His answer will never fit the question because the question is always
new. Even if the question appears the same it cannot be the same because
the context is different, the situation is different, the whole
reference is different -- and you have to be very alive, unprejudiced,
you have to be just like a mirror, reflecting whatsoever is the case and
responding accordingly, not according to a preconceived idea.</p><p>Morality is a phony lie, because the ideas are given by others and
you are living them -- you are just an imitator. I am against all
morality -- that does not mean that I am for immorality. In fact it is
morality that creates immorality too. I am for transcendence,
transcendence of the very idea of morality -- and of course, this
implies immorality too.</p><p>I am for consciousness, not for conscience. I don't want to give you
any shoulds or should nots. I simply want you to become more aware,
alert, watchful, clear, unclouded. When you are like a flame without
smoke, whatsoever you do will be right. In a state of clarity the wrong
is impossible, but then your character comes from your consciousness,
not from your conscience, then it comes from yourself. Then it is a real
rose, growing out of your being, and everything real has a beauty -- it
has a fragrance.</p><p>Jesus was not moral, that's why he was crucified. He did not follow
the old idea given by the society. He started living on his own, he was
an individual, a rebel. Socrates was not moral, that was his crime. The
society could not forgive him.</p><p>No authentic person has ever been moral in that sense; although in
another sense only those few authentic people have been really moral,
but then you have to write the word 'moral' with inverted commas.</p><p>It is a totally different thing, it is not the so-called 'morality'.
Authentic people's morality comes from their consciousness; hence they
never feel the puritan's ego. You can never see in their eyes the
holier-than-thou look, you can never see in them any condemnation for
anybody. They have immense respect, even for those who are fast asleep
and snoring, because they know that once, they too were sleeping and
they too were snoring, and if they can awake, others also can</p><p>awake.</p><p>The moment a person becomes awakened, becomes a buddha, he knows that
everybody has the potential of being a buddha, and he becomes
tremendously respectful to the buddhahood of everybody -- awake or
asleep it doesn't matter -- buddhahood is buddhahood!</p><p>So I teach you buddhahood, awareness, awakening, but I don't give you
any discipline. And that is my revolution. Religions have given only
conscience, and that's how they all have cheated human beings. They have
created hypocrites, they have also created a very schizophrenic
humanity, a mad world. The people 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

sages, mahatmas.</p><p>I am against all this nonsense. My approach is very simple and
clear-cut. I give you a single key but it is a master key; it unlocks
all the doors: Be aware! Be more and more aware. Bring that moment
closer and closer when you can feel that your whole being is full of
awareness. When there is not even a single spot inside you which is
dark, unconscious -- then you have come home.</p><p>This is the goal of sannyas: to be enlightened, to be fully aware and
full of light.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

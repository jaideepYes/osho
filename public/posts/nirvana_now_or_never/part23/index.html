It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Edvaldo. Dhyan means meditation, Edvaldo means rich.\nJesus says: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.' Now, it is a very paradoxical statement and has not been understood by the followers of Christ at all. It is the destiny of all paradoxical statements. But religion can only be expressed in paradoxes, there is no other way. It cannot be logical, it has to be supra-logical. Existence is not logical so nothing can be done about it. And religion is the purest expression, at least an effort, to come closest to the truth, hence it becomes paradoxical.\nThe statement that 'Blessed are the poor in spirit' really means 'Blessed are the rich in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.' One who has the kingdom of God cannot be poor. Then who else shall be rich if he is poor? Then what Jesus means is simply one thing: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit' means 'Blessed who have dropped their ego.'\nPeople think ego is their richness -- that is really their poverty. The moment you drop the ego you feel as 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nif you are becoming poor, because of your preconception of the ego as richness. Once you have dropped it, suddenly you discover a totally new kind of richness. Immediately, the whole kingdom of God is yours.\nSo I would like to say to you: Blessed are the rich in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of god. And the only way to be rich in spirit is meditation, because the only way to drop the ego is meditation. It is only through meditation that one an drop all egoistic ambitions, all egoistic trips and numbers -- which are utterly futile, lead nowhere, simply destroy your whole life opportunity and keep you poor.\nYou may accumulate wealth, power, prestige on the outside. but that is not going to help you to become rich. Richness is something of the inner. When your inner lotus blossoms and the fragrance is released, that's the kingdom of god, the true richness.\nThis is your name: swami Dhyan Sjaak. Dhyan means meditation, Sjaak means one who is protected by god.\nThe ego is an effort to protect yourself; meditation is a surrender to the whole. It is dropping the very idea of separation, hence no question of protection. It is living in tune with the whole, wherever it leads. It is living like a white cloud -- wherever the winds take it, it is available. That availability is meditation. Not even for a single moment any reluctance, resistance, just going with the wind, not pushing the river but going with the river.\nAnd then the miracle happens: the whole existence starts protecting you, in life, in death, in every situation. we belong to existence, existence belongs to us; there is no separation anywhere.\nHence all fear is our invention, like a nightmare. and when you are in a nightmare you believe in the nightmare, and you start running, protecting yourself. All that is needed is that you should wake up.\nProtection is not needed because there is nothing against you; there is no enemy.\nOnce you wake up suddenly you start laughing about the whole ridiculousness of the nightmare -- it never existed in the first place! And with the disappearance of the nightmare, life starts having a totally different colour, a new beauty, a new blissfulness.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Nehesh. Dhyan means meditation, Nehesh means god of love.\nMan can either live in fear or in love; these are the two alternatives, the only alternatives. One who lives in fear lives in hell; he creates his own hell, there is no other hell. Hell is not part of geography, part of existence, neither is heaven part of geography or part of existence. It is all up to you, it is your choice. It is your creativity what you create around yourself. If you live in fear you go on constantly creating hell; if you live in love you create heaven.\nAnd the only way to move from fear to love is meditation, because meditation gives you a quantum leap from mind to no-mind, from the head to the heart. The heart is your heaven and the head is your hell. The difference is not very big, just few inches, but the jump is really a quantum leap -- as if you are going from one existence into another existence, so close yet so far.\nBut it has been managed, it can be managed; it is everybody's birthright. Just a little courage... and a push of a loving master from the back! A kick in the pants, and before you have realized it has happened!\nYou be ready, and rest assured it will happen!\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Gyanesh. Dhyan means meditation, Gyanesh means god of wisdom.\nKnowledge is a pretender -- it pretends to be wise -- in fact it is just the otherwise! It is stupidity masquerading as intelligence. It is not wisdom because it is not yours own; it is borrowed, it is information.\nWisdom happens only through TRANSformation, not through information. It does not come from the outside, it springs within you. It is your intrinsic nature. The seed is there, the soil is needed. And that's what meditation is all about: giving a right soil to the seed of wisdom.\nIf you become silent, relaxed, unpossessed by the past and the future, you are providing the right soil, the right climate. Then the seed bursts on its own accord, and then suddenly you realize that all that you have been seeking on the outside you had contained it already always. The whole search was futile.\nMeditation means a new dimension of the search: not looking out but looking in, a hundred eighty degree turn.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyan Garimo. Dhyan means meditation, Garimo means the glory, the splendour.\nA man without meditation knows nothing of the splendour of existence, knows nothing of the glorious opportunity that has been given to him. He is fast asleep. The sky is full of stars, but he is fast asleep, unaware of the beauty of the sky. The birds are singing but he is fast asleep, unaware of the songs and the music. The flowers are blooming but he is fast asleep -- in the garden of Eden itself! The flowers are not for him, they are there.\nAll that is needed is an wakening so he can see the flowers, the stars, the birds, the trees, and this immense glory of existence. It is unbelievable, incredible!\nBut people are living as if there is nothing worth living. People are living meaninglessly, without any joy, without any dance, as if simply waiting for death to come and relive them from the burden. This is a very topsy-turvy state!\nWe have been given the most beautiful and the most perfect existence possible -- existence cannot be more perfect than it is -- but we have to discover it. That is a challenge! And it is good that there is a challenge in life, otherwise life will be dead; it is the challenge that makes it alive.\nAnd meditation is the greatest challenge in life: it is discovering your wakefulness; it is destroying your sleepiness, your somnambulism; it is a\ntremendous awakening of the soul. And the moment you are awake you simply cannot belive the story that Adam and Eve have been thrown out of heaven or out of the garden of Eden. They are still there, just fast asleep.\nThe fruit of the tree of knowledge has functioned as a very big dose of sleepiness, and they are asleep.\nNobody has driven them out of Eden -- because there is nowhere else to drive you out! And in fact, in those days even cars were not available, so even if God wanted to drive you out he could not! Even the Ford T-model was not available!\nEverybody is where we belong, just we are asleep. So meditation is only a challenge to wake up. Wake up in all your activities, thoughts, feelings. Make it a constant effort so that nothing goes in sleepiness, every moment is used as an opportunity to be more awake. It is an art; if you practise it it comes. It is just like practising music -- you have to practise continuously. Once Mozart was asked that 'If you don't practise three days, what will happen?' Because eight to twelve hours every day he was practising, even when he has become a world- known master.\nHe said, 'If I don't practise three days, I will notice the difference; if I don't practise for four days, critics will notice the difference; if I don't practise for six days, even a layman will know the difference; and if I don't practise for seven days, even those who are fast asleep, they will immediately notice the difference.'\nLife is a musical instrument, and awareness is its greatest music. One has to practise it continuously.\nAnd it is such a joy to enter more and more deeper into it that it is not tedious, tiring, exhausting; it is very fulfilling, nourishing, because it takes you every moment to higher peaks of ecstasies.\nThis is your name: swami Dhyan Virato. Dhyan means meditation, Virato means the infinite.\nMan's only misery is to be enclosed in a very finite existence: the bodymind structure. He is vast, his consciousness is vast, but he has become too much identified with the bodymind. Nothing is wrong with bodymind structure -- it is a beautiful structure -- but identification is wrong.\nIt is like you are standing on the window, nearby the window, looking outside towards the sky, and rather than looking at the sky you become attached to the window-frame -- then you will be in trouble.\nWindow-frame is not at fault, it is a blessing: it makes you available the whole sky beyond it, the sunrise, the moon, the trees, the people. But if you become attached with the window-frame and you forget all about that the window allows you to see, then it is your fault.\nBodymind is just a window-frame, and people have become identified with it; they think it is what they are.\nSannyas means getting unidentified with bodymind structure. use it to its fullest potential, but remember you are far greater than it. It is only a window to go beyond, to surpass, to transcend. It is a window from where you can fly towards the sky.\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyanpriya. Dhyanpriya means one who loves silence. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are very few people who love silence, although many people say they would like to be silent. But the moment they are silent they are not happy; they start immediately searching for some diversion, distraction, some occupation. They are afraid of being silent and there is a reason why they are afraid, because the more silent you become the more you disappear.\nYou are noise because you are your mind, you are noise because you are your ego. When the mind disappears, the mind and the ego both start evaporating. Then there is silence. Then you are really close to your authentic centre, but you are unaware of it so you don't know where you are going. It seems like you are falling into an abysmal depth, a bottomless phenomenon. Fear grips and one starts searching for some diversion, some occupation -- anything to cling to.\nAnd these are the people who hanker for immortality -- and they don't know what to do on their off day!\nJust think: if they are really allowed to be immortals, what they will do? People talk about beautiful things, not knowing what they are talking.\nBut if one loves silence then one loves god, then one loves existence, then one loves truth. Then one loves religion in its purest essence, because it is only through silence that one discovers the scriptures --\nscriptures that are hidden within you, sermons that are ready to explode within you, light that is waiting and waiting for you to come home, but you are roaming and groping in darkness. Everywhere people are going to the Everest, to the moon, to the Mars; nobody seems to be interested to go within.\nMeditation is the art of going within, and to love is what sannyas is all about. Sannyas can be defined as a tremendous love for silence. Your name precisely defines silence: Dhyanpriya, one who loves meditation, silence, peace.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Saritam. Dhyan means meditation, saritam means continuum, a riverlike continuity.\nThere is a beginning but there is no end. Meditation begins but never ends. How can silence end? How can blissful end..blissfulness end? How can lovingness end? They begin; if they end that simply shows they never had begun in the first place. You must have believed that they have started, but the very start was false. Everything that is true is eternal.\nAnd meditation is one of the most significant things in life, nothing is more significant than that, because it leads you to all that is our longest desire, deepest longing, for which we have been searching for lives together. It opens all the doors of existence -- freedom, love, awareness, beauty, truth -- everything suddenly becomes available.\nOnly one thing you have to do: you have to turn the key of meditation -- and it is within you hands! The key is there, the lock is there. But people are standing like fools, holding their key, not knowing that the lock is there, looking at the lock, not knowing that the key is there in their hands. A strange situation in the world!\nBuddha said the day he became enlightened that 'I am surprised why I had to\nwait so long, because all that was needed was always with me -- just a little combination. And now I am at a loss what to say to people, because they don't need anything! They have been already provided for.'\nExistence has taken every care that whatsoever you will need on the way has been given to you, even the ultimate key to reach to the goal. And that ultimate key is silence, becoming utterly silent, and then a riverlike undercurrent starts flowing in you. You will remain in the world, you will be in the marketplace, but nothing will disturb it. It will be there and it will affect everything that you will say, you will do, you will be.\nSo I am not for my sannyasins that they should escape to the mountains, monasteries -- no, they should be in the world, it is a beautiful world. All that you need to know is how to remain centered, grounded, silent, amidst all the noise and the turmoil, how to be a centre of the cyclone. That's the whole art of sannyas.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Bodhisattva. Dhyan means meditation.\nMeditation is a state of no-mind. We are born in a state of meditation: the nine months in the mother's womb are of immense meditation, deep meditation. But once we are out of the womb the society jumps upon us, starts creating a mind around meditation, because meditation cannot be used. It is not a commodity; it cannot be sold, cannot be purchased. It has no relevance with the world of politics, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\neconomics, etcetera. The society is not interested in it -- not only not interested, it is absolutely against it, because it is dangerous. A man who is meditative cannot be manipulated; he has such intelligence, you cannot manipulate him.\nIn the whole Bible not a single statement exists in praise of intelligence. Strange! Such a big scripture and not a single statement -- and full of all kinds of rubbish, but not a single statement in praise of intelligence. And the same is the truth about other scriptures of other religions too: they support superstition, they\nsupport belief, they support indirectly all kinds of ignorance, but they don't support intelligence. Intelligence is a danger to the whole establishment -- and meditation is pure intelligence, fresh intelligence.\nHence all the societies without any exception -- Eastern or Western, Hindu or Mohammedan, Christian or Buddhist -- they have all destroyed intelligence. Their structures may differ, their ideologies may differ, but about all thing they are all agreed -- the basic conspiracy against man -- that man should not be allowed to be meditative. He should be forced into a certain structure of the mind -- Hindu mind, Christian mind, Mohammedan mind, Indian mind, American mind, German mind -- some structure has to be imposed so that we can manipulate through the structure. That structure is just like electrodes which can be manipulated by remote control.\nThe moment somebody says something against Jesus, The Christian starts feeling disturbed -- a remote control; somebody says in praise of Jesus and the Christian is elated. it is a remote control system --\nprimitive type. Now we have better remote control systems, and sooner or later governments are going to use them.…\nIt is not far away when each child will be fixed with an electrode in the hospital when he is born -- a small electrode of which he will never be aware because inside the skull there is no sensation. You can put just a small electrode inside and he will never know. And from the Moscow or Washington or New Delhi, any fool -- any Nixon, any Adolf Hitler, any Morarji Desai -- can control the whole country, can make people violent, can make people silent, can make people very obedient, can manipulate without those people ever becoming aware that they are being used as machines.\nBut this is what has been done up to now. The priest and the politician both have been in deep conspiracy to create mind and destroy meditation.\nMy effort here is to undo what the society has done to you, to bring back to your primal innocence, to your innocence that you had before you were born, to bring you back that innocence which you had in your womb... in your mother's womb\n-- that clean slate; nothing was written on it. Once that is discovered you have discovered Buddha in you.\nThat is the meaning of bodhisattva: bodhi means awakening, sattva means the\nessence.\nMeditation is the essence of awakening. Once you have learned how to be innocent, silent, once you can put the mind aside -- that means all the society and all the establishment aside -- suddenly you discover your authentic individuality, your freedom, your beauty, your wings. Then the whole sky is yours ... or perhaps even the sky is not the limit!\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Sanatan. Dhyan means meditation, Sanatan means the eternal.\nThousands of sciences have existed in the world and disappeared. There was a day magic dominated, now it is no more so. There was a day when astrology dominated, now it is no more so. Many sciences have come into existence and gone out of existence..\nOnly one science has been eternally there and that is the science or meditation -- and it is going to be eternally there because it has nothing to do with anything else but your very essential core. And unless every man has discovered his consciousness meditation is going to remain of the supermost value. And it seems almost impossible that every man one day will attain -- or even if you attain your child will have to attain again -- so meditation is going to remain as the essential core that joins us with the whole humanity that will come afterwards.\nThat is the meaning of Sanatano: eternal. All other sciences are mundane: they make you capable of earning more, becoming respectable more, becoming more powerful. Meditation does not help you in the outside world, but it immensely enriches your inner being. It makes you divine! It gives you god himself.\nSo only fools are interested in outside things; the wiser ones sooner or later turn. And the more wise they are, sooner.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Puratan. Dhyan means meditation, Puratan means the ancient one.\nWe are not new in the world; we are not born with our birth and we don't die with our death. Birth and death are small events in the continuity of eternal life. We are the ancient ones: we have always been here, we will always be here.\nBut this revelation happens only through meditation. If you remain clinging to the mind then birth and death is your whole span of life, because mind starts after birth and dies in death. That is really the mind's life, not your life, but if you think you are the mind then naturally the corollary is that birth and death are the limits.\nThe moment you slip out of the mind like a snake slipping out of the old skin, suddenly you see that birth is not your beginning, neither death is your end. You are beginningless, endless. And that very experience transports you beyond time into the world of eternity. And that is our deepest desire: to be immortals, to go beyond death, to be deathless.\nAll sciences belong to the world, confined between birth and death; meditation belongs beyond birth and death. The real seeker is always searching for it; only the stupid ones are searching for money, power, prestige -- which all will be taken away. Only meditation cannot be taken away from you. It cannot be stolen, it cannot be burnt, it cannot be destroyed even by atom bombs or hydrogen bombs. To find it is to have found the rock-bottom of existence.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Sagaresh. Dhyan means meditation, Sagaresh means god of the ocean\n-- literally; metaphorically it means the oceanic.\nMan without meditation is just a dewdrop; with the meditation the dewdrop suddenly becomes the ocean. It is the greatest magic, the greatest miracle. It takes you beyond all confinement, all limitation, all bondage. And we are suffering in a prison; there are limitations everywhere. Even the riches has limitations.\nEven the greatest conqueror, Alexander the Great, has limitations.…\nAt the last moment of his life he recognized that he has wasted his life. he died\nvery early, he was only thirty-three, and he had promised to reach to his capital. Particularly to his mother he has promised that he will bring a gift to her no son has ever brought: the whole kingdom of the world! And he has conquered the then-known world, and he was just twenty-four hours away from the capital. Just twenty-four hours more and he would have fulfilled his promise, and he wanted to fulfil it at any cost. He told to his physicians, 'I am ready to give everything that you want.'\nThey said, 'Even if you give your whole kingdom nothing can be done -- only few minutes more and you will be gone.'\nThen he wept. For the first time people saw tears coming out of his eyes, and they asked, 'Why are you weeping? A man of such courage! We have never thought that you will be afraid of death!'\nHe said, 'I am not afraid of death, I am just weeping that I wasted my life for something absolutely useless -- which cannot even help me to live twenty-four hours more! I am ready to give the whole kingdom for which I have wasted thirty-three years -- because of that wastage I am dying. What is the point of gaining all this wisdom (?) this victory, this richness, this wealth? I am crying for it, not for death -- that this opportunity has gone down the drain.\n'Leave my hands hanging outside my coffin so that everybody can see that I am going empty-handed, that I was a fool!'\nThe only thing that you can take away with you is meditation, your inner experience of consciousness, joy, silence, and your inner experience of oceanic vastness. In other words, the religions call it god; that is just a word. There is no person like god. hence my insistence is always on godliness. God is not a person but a presence, not an ocean but oceanicness, not somebody who is infinite but something like infinity, not someone who is eternal but something like eternity.

Edvaldo means rich.</p><p>Jesus says: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of God.' Now, it is a very paradoxical statement and has not
been understood by the followers of Christ at all. It is the destiny of
all paradoxical statements. But religion can only be expressed in
paradoxes, there is no other way. It cannot be logical, it has to be
supra-logical. Existence is not logical so nothing can be done about it.
And religion is the purest expression, at least an effort, to come
closest to the truth, hence it becomes paradoxical.</p><p>The statement that 'Blessed are the poor in spirit' really means
'Blessed are the rich in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.' One
who has the kingdom of God cannot be poor. Then who else shall be rich
if he is poor? Then what Jesus means is simply one thing: 'Blessed are
the poor in spirit' means 'Blessed who have dropped their ego.'</p><p>People think ego is their richness -- that is really their poverty.
The moment you drop the ego you feel as 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>if you are becoming poor, because of your preconception of the ego as
richness. Once you have dropped it, suddenly you discover a totally new
kind of richness. Immediately, the whole kingdom of God is yours.</p><p>So I would like to say to you: Blessed are the rich in spirit, for
<em>theirs</em> is the kingdom of god. And the only way to be rich in
spirit is meditation, because the only way to drop the ego is
meditation. It is only through meditation that one an drop all egoistic
ambitions, all egoistic trips and numbers -- which are utterly futile,
lead nowhere, simply destroy your whole life opportunity and keep you
poor.</p><p>You may accumulate wealth, power, prestige on the outside. but that
is not going to help you to become rich. Richness is something of the
inner. When your inner lotus blossoms and the fragrance is released,
that's the kingdom of god, the true richness.</p><p>This is your name: swami Dhyan Sjaak. Dhyan means meditation, Sjaak
means one who is protected by god.</p><p>The ego is an effort to protect yourself; meditation is a surrender
to the whole. It is dropping the very idea of separation, hence no
question of protection. It is living in tune with the whole, wherever it
leads. It is living like a white cloud -- wherever the winds take it, it
is available. That availability is meditation. Not even for a single
moment any reluctance, resistance, just going with the wind, not pushing
the river but going with the river.</p><p>And then the miracle happens: the whole existence starts protecting
you, in life, in death, in every situation. we belong to existence,
existence belongs to us; there is no separation anywhere.</p><p>Hence all fear is our invention, like a nightmare. and when you are
in a nightmare you <em>believe</em> in the nightmare, and you start
running, protecting yourself. All that is needed is that you should wake
up.</p><p>Protection is not needed because there is nothing against you; there
is no enemy.</p><p>Once you wake up suddenly you start laughing about the whole
ridiculousness of the nightmare -- it never existed in the first place!
And with the disappearance of the nightmare, life starts having a
totally different colour, a new beauty, a new blissfulness.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Nehesh. Dhyan means meditation, Nehesh
means god of love.</p><p>Man can either live in fear or in love; these are the two
alternatives, the <em>only</em> alternatives. One who lives in fear
lives in hell; he creates his own hell, there is no other hell. Hell is
not part of geography, part of existence, neither is heaven part of
geography or part of existence. It is all up to you, it is your choice.
It is your creativity what you create around yourself. If you live in
fear you go on constantly creating hell; if you live in love you create
heaven.</p><p>And the only way to move from fear to love is meditation, because
meditation gives you a quantum leap from mind to no-mind, from the head
to the heart. The heart is your heaven and the head is your hell. The
difference is not very big, just few inches, but the jump is really a
quantum leap -- as if you are going from one existence into another
existence, so close yet so far.</p><p>But it has been managed, it can be managed; it is everybody's
birthright. Just a little courage... and a push of a loving master from
the back! A kick in the pants, and before you have realized it has
happened!</p><p>You be ready, and rest assured it will happen!</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Gyanesh. Dhyan means meditation,
Gyanesh means god of wisdom.</p><p>Knowledge is a pretender -- it pretends to be wise -- in fact it is
just the otherwise! It is stupidity masquerading as intelligence. It is
not wisdom because it is not yours own; it is borrowed, it is
information.</p><p>Wisdom happens only through TRANSformation, not through information.
It does not come from the outside, it springs within you. It is your
intrinsic nature. The seed is there, the soil is needed. And that's what
meditation is all about: giving a right soil to the seed of wisdom.</p><p>If you become silent, relaxed, unpossessed by the past and the
future, you are providing the right soil, the right climate. Then the
seed bursts on its own accord, and then suddenly you realize that all
that you have been seeking on the outside you had contained it already
always. The whole search was futile.</p><p>Meditation means a new dimension of the search: not looking out but
looking in, a hundred eighty degree turn.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your name: Ma Dhyan Garimo. Dhyan means meditation, Garimo
means the glory, the splendour.</p><p>A man without meditation knows nothing of the splendour of existence,
knows nothing of the glorious opportunity that has been given to him. He
is fast asleep. The sky is full of stars, but he is fast asleep, unaware
of the beauty of the sky. The birds are singing but he is fast asleep,
unaware of the songs and the music. The flowers are blooming but he is
fast asleep -- in the garden of Eden itself! The flowers are
<em>not</em> for him, they are there.</p><p>All that is needed is an wakening so he can see the flowers, the
stars, the birds, the trees, and this immense glory of existence. It is
unbelievable, incredible!</p><p>But people are living as if there is nothing <em>worth</em> living.
People are living meaninglessly, without any joy, without any dance, as
if simply waiting for death to come and relive them from the burden.
This is a very topsy-turvy state!</p><p>We have been given the most beautiful and the most perfect existence
possible -- existence cannot be more perfect than it is -- but we have
to discover it. That is a challenge! And it is good that there is a
challenge in life, otherwise life will be dead; it is the challenge that
makes it alive.</p><p>And meditation is the greatest challenge in life: it is discovering
your wakefulness; it is destroying your sleepiness, your somnambulism;
it is a</p><p>tremendous awakening of the soul. And the moment you are awake you
simply cannot belive the story that Adam and Eve have been thrown out of
heaven or out of the garden of Eden. They are still there, just fast
asleep.</p><p>The fruit of the tree of knowledge has functioned as a very big dose
of sleepiness, and they are asleep.</p><p>Nobody has driven them out of Eden -- because there is nowhere else
to drive you out! And in fact, in those days even cars were not
available, so even if God wanted to drive you out he could not! Even the
Ford T-model was not available!</p><p>Everybody is where we belong, just we are asleep. So meditation is
only a challenge to wake up. Wake up in all your activities, thoughts,
feelings. Make it a constant effort so that nothing goes in sleepiness,
every moment is used as an opportunity to be more awake. It is an art;
if you practise it it comes. It is just like practising music -- you
have to practise continuously. Once Mozart was asked that 'If you don't
practise three days, what will happen?' Because eight to twelve hours
every day he was practising, even when he has become a world- known
master.</p><p>He said, 'If I don't practise three days, I will notice the
difference; if I don't practise for four days, critics will notice the
difference; if I don't practise for six days, even a layman will know
the difference; and if I don't practise for seven days, even those who
are fast asleep, they will immediately notice the difference.'</p><p>Life is a musical instrument, and awareness is its greatest music.
One has to practise it continuously.</p><p>And it is such a joy to enter more and more deeper into it that it is
not tedious, tiring, exhausting; it is very fulfilling, nourishing,
because it takes you every moment to higher peaks of ecstasies.</p><p>This is your name: swami Dhyan Virato. Dhyan means meditation, Virato
means the infinite.</p><p>Man's only misery is to be enclosed in a very finite existence: the
bodymind structure. He is vast, his consciousness is vast, but he has
become too much identified with the bodymind. Nothing is wrong with
bodymind structure -- it is a beautiful structure -- but identification
is wrong.</p><p>It is like you are standing on the window, nearby the window, looking
outside towards the sky, and rather than looking at the sky you become
attached to the window-frame -- then you will be in trouble.</p><p>Window-frame is not at fault, it is a blessing: it makes you
available the whole sky beyond it, the sunrise, the moon, the trees, the
people. But if you become attached with the window-frame and you forget
all about that the window allows you to see, then it is your fault.</p><p>Bodymind is just a window-frame, and people have become identified
with it; they think it is what they are.</p><p>Sannyas means getting unidentified with bodymind structure. use it to
its fullest potential, but remember you are far greater than it. It is
only a window to go beyond, to surpass, to transcend. It is a window
from where you can fly towards the sky.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Dhyanpriya. Dhyanpriya means one who loves
silence. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>There are very few people who love silence, although many people say
they would <em>like</em> to be silent. But the moment they are silent
they are not happy; they start immediately searching for some diversion,
distraction, some occupation. They are afraid of being silent and there
is a reason why they are afraid, because the more silent you become the
more you disappear.</p><p>You are noise because you are your mind, you are noise because you
are your ego. When the mind disappears, the mind and the ego both start
evaporating. Then there is silence. Then you are really close to your
authentic centre, but you are unaware of it so you don't know where you
are going. It seems like you are falling into an abysmal depth, a
bottomless phenomenon. Fear grips and one starts searching for some
diversion, some occupation -- anything to cling to.</p><p>And these are the people who hanker for immortality -- and they don't
know what to do on their off day!</p><p>Just think: if they are really allowed to be immortals, what they
will do? People talk about beautiful things, not knowing what they are
talking.</p><p>But if one loves silence then one loves god, then one loves
existence, then one loves truth. Then one loves religion in its purest
essence, because it is only through silence that one discovers the
scriptures --</p><p>scriptures that are hidden within you, sermons that are ready to
explode within you, light that is waiting and waiting for you to come
home, but you are roaming and groping in darkness. Everywhere people are
going to the Everest, to the moon, to the Mars; nobody seems to be
interested to go within.</p><p>Meditation is the art of going within, and to love is what sannyas is
all about. Sannyas can be defined as a tremendous love for silence. Your
name precisely defines silence: Dhyanpriya, one who loves meditation,
silence, peace.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Saritam. Dhyan means meditation,
saritam means continuum, a riverlike continuity.</p><p>There is a beginning but there is no end. Meditation begins but never
ends. How can silence end? How can blissful end..blissfulness end? How
can lovingness end? They begin; if they end that simply shows they never
had begun in the first place. You must have believed that they have
started, but the very start was false. Everything that is true is
eternal.</p><p>And meditation is one of the most significant things in life, nothing
is more significant than that, because it leads you to all that is our
longest desire, deepest longing, for which we have been searching for
lives together. It opens all the doors of existence -- freedom, love,
awareness, beauty, truth -- everything suddenly becomes available.</p><p>Only one thing you have to do: you have to turn the key of meditation
-- and it is within you hands! The key is there, the lock is there. But
people are standing like fools, holding their key, not knowing that the
lock is there, looking at the lock, not knowing that the key is there in
their hands. A strange situation in the world!</p><p>Buddha said the day he became enlightened that 'I am surprised why I
had to</p><p>wait so long, because all that was needed was always with me -- just
a little combination. And now I am at a loss what to say to people,
because they don't need anything! They have been already provided
for.'</p><p>Existence has taken every care that whatsoever you will need on the
way has been given to you, even the ultimate key to reach to the goal.
And that ultimate key is silence, becoming utterly silent, and then a
riverlike undercurrent starts flowing in you. You will remain in the
world, you will be in the marketplace, but nothing will disturb it. It
will be there and it will affect everything that you will say, you will
do, you will be.</p><p>So I am not for my sannyasins that they should escape to the
mountains, monasteries -- no, they should be in the world, it is a
beautiful world. All that you need to know is how to remain centered,
grounded, silent, amidst all the noise and the turmoil, how to be a
centre of the cyclone. That's the whole art of sannyas.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Bodhisattva. Dhyan means
meditation.</p><p>Meditation is a state of no-mind. We are born in a state of
meditation: the nine months in the mother's womb are of immense
meditation, deep meditation. But once we are out of the womb the society
jumps upon us, starts creating a mind around meditation, because
meditation cannot be used. It is not a commodity; it cannot be sold,
cannot be purchased. It has no relevance with the world of politics,

not interested, it is absolutely against it, because it is dangerous. A
man who is meditative cannot be manipulated; he has such intelligence,
you cannot manipulate him.</p><p>In the whole Bible not a single statement exists in praise of
intelligence. Strange! Such a big scripture and not a single statement
-- and full of all kinds of rubbish, but not a single statement in
praise of intelligence. And the same is the truth about other scriptures
of other religions too: they support superstition, they</p><p>support belief, they support indirectly all kinds of ignorance, but
they don't support intelligence. Intelligence is a danger to the whole
establishment -- and meditation is pure intelligence, fresh
intelligence.</p><p>Hence all the societies without any exception -- Eastern or Western,
Hindu or Mohammedan, Christian or Buddhist -- they have all destroyed
intelligence. Their structures may differ, their ideologies may differ,
but about all thing they are all agreed -- the basic conspiracy against
man -- that man should not be allowed to be meditative. He should be
forced into a certain structure of the mind -- Hindu mind, Christian
mind, Mohammedan mind, Indian mind, American mind, German mind -- some
structure has to be imposed so that we can manipulate through the
structure. That structure is just like electrodes which can be
manipulated by remote control.</p><p>The moment somebody says something against Jesus, The Christian
starts feeling disturbed -- a remote control; somebody says in praise of
Jesus and the Christian is elated. it is a remote control system --</p><p>primitive type. Now we have better remote control systems, and sooner
or later governments are going to use them.…</p><p>It is not far away when each child will be fixed with an electrode in
the hospital when he is born -- a small electrode of which he will never
be aware because inside the skull there is no sensation. You can put
just a small electrode inside and he will never know. And from the
Moscow or Washington or New Delhi, any fool -- any Nixon, any Adolf
Hitler, any Morarji Desai -- can control the whole country, can make
people violent, can make people silent, can make people very obedient,
can manipulate without those people ever becoming aware that they are
being used as machines.</p><p>But this is what has been done up to now. The priest and the
politician both have been in deep conspiracy to create mind and destroy
meditation.</p><p>My effort here is to undo what the society has done to you, to bring
back to your primal innocence, to your innocence that you had before you
were born, to bring you back that innocence which you had in your
womb... in your mother's womb</p><p>-- that clean slate; nothing was written on it. Once that is
discovered you have discovered Buddha in you.</p><p>That is the meaning of bodhisattva: bodhi means awakening, sattva
means the</p><p>essence.</p><p>Meditation is the essence of awakening. Once you have learned how to
be innocent, silent, once you can put the mind aside -- that means all
the society and all the establishment aside -- suddenly you discover
your authentic individuality, your freedom, your beauty, <em>your
wings</em>. Then the whole sky is yours ... or perhaps even the sky is
not the limit!</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Sanatan. Dhyan means meditation,
Sanatan means the eternal.</p><p>Thousands of sciences have existed in the world and disappeared.
There was a day magic dominated, now it is no more so. There was a day
when astrology dominated, now it is no more so. Many sciences have come
into existence and gone out of existence..</p><p>Only one science has been eternally there and that is the science or
meditation -- and it is <em>going</em> to be eternally there because it
has nothing to do with anything else but your very essential core. And
unless every man has discovered his consciousness meditation is going to
remain of the supermost value. And it seems almost impossible that every
man one day will attain -- or even if <em>you</em> attain your child
will have to attain again -- so meditation is going to remain as the
essential core that joins us with the whole humanity that will come
afterwards.</p><p>That is the meaning of Sanatano: eternal. All other sciences are
mundane: they make you capable of earning more, becoming respectable
more, becoming more powerful. Meditation does not help you in the
outside world, but it immensely enriches your inner being. It makes you
divine! It gives you god himself.</p><p>So only fools are interested in outside things; the wiser ones sooner
or later turn. And the more wise they are, sooner.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Puratan. Dhyan means meditation,
Puratan means the ancient one.</p><p>We are not new in the world; we are not born with our birth and we
don't die with our death. Birth and death are small events in the
continuity of eternal life. We are the ancient ones: we have always been
here, we will always be here.</p><p>But this revelation happens only through meditation. If you remain
clinging to the mind then birth and death is your whole span of life,
because mind starts after birth and dies in death. That is really the
<em>mind's</em> life, not <em>your</em> life, but if you think you are
the mind then naturally the corollary is that birth and death are the
limits.</p><p>The moment you slip out of the mind like a snake slipping out of the
old skin, suddenly you see that birth is not <em>your</em> beginning,
neither death is your end. You are beginningless, endless. And that very
experience transports you beyond time into the world of eternity. And
that is our deepest desire: to be immortals, to go beyond death, to be
deathless.</p><p>All sciences belong to the world, confined between birth and death;
meditation belongs beyond birth and death. The real seeker is always
searching for it; only the stupid ones are searching for money, power,
prestige -- which all will be taken away. Only meditation cannot be
taken away from you. It cannot be stolen, it cannot be burnt, it cannot
be destroyed even by atom bombs or hydrogen bombs. To find it is to have
found the rock-bottom of existence.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Sagaresh. Dhyan means meditation,
Sagaresh means god of the ocean</p><p>-- literally; metaphorically it means the oceanic.</p><p>Man without meditation is just a dewdrop; with the meditation the
dewdrop suddenly becomes the ocean. It is the greatest magic, the
greatest miracle. It takes you beyond all confinement, all limitation,
all bondage. And we are suffering in a prison; there are limitations
everywhere. Even the riches has limitations.</p><p>Even the greatest conqueror, Alexander the Great, has
limitations.…</p><p>At the last moment of his life he recognized that he has wasted his
life. he died</p><p>very early, he was only thirty-three, and he had promised to reach to
his capital. Particularly to his mother he has promised that he will
bring a gift to her no son has ever brought: the whole kingdom of the
world! And he has conquered the then-known world, and he was just
twenty-four hours away from the capital. Just twenty-four hours more and
he would have fulfilled his promise, and he wanted to fulfil it at any
cost. He told to his physicians, 'I am ready to give everything that you
want.'</p><p>They said, 'Even if you give your whole kingdom nothing can be done
-- only few minutes more and you will be gone.'</p><p>Then he wept. For the first time people saw tears coming out of his
eyes, and they asked, 'Why are you weeping? A man of such courage! We
have never thought that you will be afraid of death!'</p><p>He said, 'I am not afraid of death, I am just weeping that I wasted
my life for something absolutely useless -- which cannot even help me to
live twenty-four hours more! I am ready to give the whole kingdom for
which I have wasted thirty-three years -- because of that wastage I am
dying. What is the point of gaining all this wisdom (?) this victory,
this richness, this wealth? I am crying for it, not for death -- that
this opportunity has gone down the drain.</p><p>'Leave my hands hanging outside my coffin so that everybody can see
that I am going empty-handed, that I was a fool!'</p><p>The only thing that you can take away with you is meditation, your
inner experience of consciousness, joy, silence, and your inner
experience of oceanic vastness. In other words, the religions call it
god; that is just a word. There is no person like god. hence my
insistence is always on godliness. God is not a person but a presence,
not an ocean but oceanicness, not somebody who is infinite but something
like infinity, not someone who is eternal but something like eternity.
And that is everybody's, just for the asking!</p><p>Jesus says: Knock and the doors shall be opened unto you. And I say
there is no need to knock -- just open your eyes, the doors are open.
Jesus says: Ask and it shall be given to you. I say to you there is no
need to ask, just see -- it is already given to you! Jesus says: Seek
and ye shall find, and I say there is no need to seek anywhere -- just
sit silently, you have found it.</p><p>Sitting silently,</p><p>Doing nothing, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

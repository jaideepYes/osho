It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Inger.\nAnand means bliss. Inger means inner beauty.\nIt is easy to be beautiful on the outside, it is difficult to be beautiful on the inside, because the outer beauty belongs to the physical existence. It is material, it is visible -- something can be done about it. It is an object: you can make it, unmake it, change it, give it a new shape -- everything is possible -- but the inner is invisible, intangible. It is not an object. It is your very subjectivity, it is your very being -- it is you! You cannot do anything about it, and that is the most important thing to understand: you cannot do anything about it, so one has to learn non-doing, one has to learn being still, silent, in a state of utter non-doing, no effort. And in that very state of non-doing bliss explodes.\nIt is not an achievement, because you have not done anything for it. You have just to be available for it.\nIt comes from the beyond, it is a grace, a gift. But once you have tasted bliss your inner world blossoms. It becomes fragrant, luminous, and when your inner world has a beauty it certainly affects your outer side too.\nThe outer can be painted in a beautiful way -- it will not change the inner because the inner is deeper.\nBut if you change the inner the outer is bound to be affected by it. The inner is the centre and the outer is the circumference. If the centre is transformed, the circumference follows like a shadow.\nBut you can go on changing the circumference: the centre will not come like a shadow following it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSannyas is the search for inner beauty. Your name exactly defines the very essence of sannyas. To me beauty is a far more significant word than truth.\nTruth is dry, desertlike, juiceless. It is a logical concept. Beauty is full of juice, life, love, warmth. It is an aesthetic experience.\nGod is more approximately defined by beauty than by truth, and to understand god as the ultimate beauty is to have a totally different kind of religion. Then it is not philosophical, it becomes poetic. Then it is not theological, then it is not unnecessarily splitting hairs, argument, systematising words and thoughts. it becomes creativity, it becomes more of a dance, more of a love, more of a song, more of a celebration.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Bill. Anand means bliss. Bill means resolution.\nMisery or bliss, both are our resolutions. We don't come in the world with a programme, we come totally free to decide our own destiny. We don't come with a fate, with a predetermined future. We come with an open future. And each act defines our being, but the action is our choice; hence nobody is responsible for your bliss or for your misery.\nThis is the first step of sannyas that \"I am responsible and totally responsible.\" Once this is understood that \"I am responsible for whatsoever I am,\" a great freedom becomes available. Then each moment you can choose to be miserable or to be blissful. Each moment both the paths are available, each moment both the doors open, but because we live with this idea -- and we have lived with this idea for thousand of years that everything is determined...\nFirst all the religions of the world gave the idea of fate, kismet, destiny, god determines -- then we become simply puppets. All the religions of the world have made man unfree, puppetlike. They have destroyed the most significant phenomenon, the phenomenon of responsibility. It is responsibility that makes you really human. All other animals have no such freedom. They have fate.\nA dog is bound to be a dog, a lion is bound to be a lion. Everything is programmed by nature or god or whatsoever name one wants to use, but one thing is certain: they come with a programme and they simply unfold the programme.\nIt is only man and his prerogative that he comes without a programme. This is to be the declaration of a sannyasin, this is going to be the basic foundation of a future religiousness: responsibility.\nReligions told man that it is fate, you cannot do anything about it; hence religious societies, for example, India, has lived in a misery, in a slavery, in poverty, in every kind of degradation, oppression, exploitation, with no complaint, thinking that it is all determined, you cannot do anything about it, it has to be so. This degrades man, it does not make man spiritual. it makes him mechanical, and even the people who area not religious in same way or other, have supported the idea.\nThey will not use the name of god and fate, then they will say nature, physiology, chemistry... but you are programmed still. Who programmes does not matter. Or even people who are anti-religious, deliberately against religion, for example, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and others, they are again talking the same thing in different words. Only the jargon changes.\nKarl Marx says it is the society, the economic structure, that determines. Individuality is completely destroyed, there is no individuality possible according to communism. Even consciousness is just a by-product of social\nconditions -- what can you do? You are born in a certain social structure and you have to follow; the way you are made, the way you are programmed, you have to unfold it. Hegel calls it History, with a capital H. It becomes the same: God, with a capital G. History determines. And Sigmund Freud says it is your unconscious, you cannot do anything about it -- what can you do? It is your unconscious. All your activity is confined to a small piece of consciousness that is one-tenth of your being; nine-tenth of your being is unconscious and everything is determined from the unconscious.\nGustav Jung goes a little even deeper: he says it is not only your unconscious but there is beneath your unconscious a collective unconscious that determines everything.\nThis has been up to now, the idea around which all the philosophies, religions, psychologies, have revolved. They are all in agreement about one basic thing that man is not responsible, and they were thinking this is helping man, this is taking away his burden. Yes, in a way man feels unburdened if he is not responsible, but at the same time he loses his freedom. The burden disappears but he become a slave.\nIt is better to be burdened and be a free man, than to be unburdened and be a slave.\nMy effort here is to make you totally free! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is a great risk to be totally free, to be responsible for each act, to be one's own creator, to be one's own god, in other words, but this is how a real being is born. And this is my own experience, because whatsoever I say, I say only if it is my experience.\nI am not an intellectual, I am not a philosopher. Whatsoever I say has its roots in my own experience.\nThis is how one day I dropped to be miserable, I decided not to be miserable, in a single moment (laughter) and since then I not been miserable!(more laughter) Every day there are opportunities, thousand and one opportunities (laughter)... Once you decide totally, once you resolve that from now on towards bliss is going to be your very lifestyle, you will be surprised: it starts happening! (more laughter) For few days one cannot believe one's own eyes that it is really happening, one cannot believe where all that misery has gone, and all those causes and psychoanalysts were going into dreams and unconscious and the collective unconscious --\nwhere all they have disappeared? (much laughter) Just like that: wipe the whole misery away, and let there be laughter and love and joy!\nHow long you will be here? How long you will be staying?\n-I'll be here two months.\n-And now ... you will be staying?\n-Two months.\n-More?\n-Yeah, I've been here three weeks. I'll be staying (much laughter) (lost in the visual and in the laughter...)\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Robert. Anand means bliss. Robert means bright.\nBliss is the brightest experience. There is nothing more luminous than bliss. One of the great mystics, Kabir, says \"When I felt bliss for the first time I thought as if thousands of suns have risen suddenly inside\n-- thousands of suns!\"\nOrdinarily man lives in darkness. Bliss brings the day, the dawn. The English word \"day\" and the word\n\"divine\" comes from the same Sanskrit root \"div\". Light is divine; hence the\nword \"day\", and hence the word \"divine\".\nLight is the most godly experience. There is no god to be seen, god is not a person, but only a quality.\nWhen you start feeling an inner brightness, when the inner darkness disappears, you know god is, because you are it. That's the only way to know. God cannot be proved in any other way. When you experience inner light you know. Seeing is knowing; it is not a question of belief, it is a question of seeing. The believers are deceiving others and themselves. No believer is religious, no believer can ever be religious. He is a hypocrite.\nMy sannyasins have not to be believers. they have to be enquirers, explorers. Sannyas begins in a certain state of agnosticism, neither atheist nor theist, just open and available, carrying no prejudice -- that is the meaning of agnostic: one who believes nothing. That does not mean that he disbelieves, he neither believes nor disbelieves. He simply says \"I don't know, so I am ready to explore.\" He starts with a state of not-knowing, and that is the most profound phenomenon -- to begin with a state of not-knowing. And then the day is not far away because you have taken the most intelligent step possible. The fools are either believers or disbelievers, either Catholics or communists, but they are the same. Their flags are different, their popes are different, their bibles are different, their gods are different, but their belief is the same.\nSomebody is carrying the Holy Bible and somebody is carrying Das Kapital, somebody believes in Moses, somebody believes in Marx, somebody believes in Kaaba and somebody believes in Kremlin -- it is the same stupidity because every disbelief is in some way or other a belief.\nSomebody believes god is without knowing and somebody believes god is not without knowing: both are travelling in the land of the fools.\nA sannyasin has to drop all belief, and belief includes disbelief too. He has to unburden himself from all prejudices so that his eyes are open, alert, ready to see whatsoever is the case. This is the beginning of intelligence. Intelligence is the seed of brightness, and when intelligence blossoms life becomes divine, the dark night of the soul is over. The day has begun!\nHow long you will be here?\n-One month.\n-That's good. Good. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Sankirtan.\nAnand means bliss. Sankirtan means a sacred song.\nLife can be lived either as a mundane affair or as a sacred phenomenon. It all depends on us. If one is running after money, power, prestige, then life remains mundane, then life remains in the marketplace --\nugly, violent, aggressive, inhuman -- because all those desires can be fulfilled only if you are cruel, competitive and violently competitive, because life is short and the competitors are millions. And they are all searching for the same goals: the same money, the same power, the same prestige. So it is going to be a cutthroat competition. Everybody is at everybody else neck.\nTo live a life in this way is to miss a great opportunity. Life can be a beautiful experience, but it becomes a nightmare instead. To live life as a sacred phenomenon one has to drop these constant ugly monsters which are implanted by the society in our head. They are almost like electrodes, implanted, and we think that we are desiring -- that's not true.\nNo child is interested in money. No child is interested in ego. No child is interested in power. But we drive them towards these goals. We educate them, we call this education. This whole process of corruption we call it education. We make them ambitious, egoistic, full of lust for power, and slowly slowly by the time they come home from the university their one-third life is already wasted in programming them, and it is a long process, twenty-five years; now to deprogramme it becomes difficult. And if the person himself is not willing to deprogramme it, it is impossible.\nSannyas simply means your willingness to be deprogrammed. If one is willing it can be done very quickly, if one is clinging to one's programme then it is very difficult; it cannot be done against you. It can be done only through your willing co-operation, only through your deep surrender, commitment, to have a new life.\nWhen a man is not searching toys, when he starts really involved in the inner search, of love, of bliss, of beauty, of truth, of freedom, then his life becomes a sacred song. Then thousands of songs arise in his being!\nThen it is something really precious. Even death cannot destroy this beauty. Death is incapable against it. Death will take away everything that you accumulate on the outside, but that which you have experienced in your inner consciousness is beyond death, it is beyond time itself. It is part of eternity. That's why I call it a sacred song.\nOne can sing a mundane song -- millions of people are doing that -- but those songs are not going to last.\nDeath will come and destroy! And when death is going to destroy all that we have done was futile, an exercise in utter futility. The only thing worth doing is that which cannot be destroyed by death -- that should be the criterion.\nLove cannot be destroyed, bliss cannot be destroyed, truth cannot be destroyed, beauty cannot be destroyed, consciousness cannot be destroyed, and these are the aspects of your inner diamond.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Dhyanesh.\nAnand means bliss. Dhyanesh means god of meditation.\nBliss is the god of meditation. We are not searching for any other god. We are not searching god as a person, because there is nobody like that. those are all just childish fantasies. The god of Christians and the Hindus and the Mohammedans and the Jews, is nothing but our projection. The Bible says god created man in his own image. The truth is just the contrary: man created god in his own image And it is so obvious.\nLook in the Old Testament and you will find all the Jewish qualities in god! Look in the Bhagavad Gita and you will find all the Hindu qualities in god. Look in the Koran and you will find all the qualities of Mohammedans in their concept\nof god.\nThese are not truths, these are just wish-fulfilments. We are creating our god according to our desires No such gods exits. The only god that truly exists is an experience of bliss. And to experience bliss the way is meditation, not prayer, but meditation. Prayer belongs to the idea of god as a person. When you think of god as a person somewhere there above the clouds then prayer becomes relevant, then it is an I-thou dialogue. You say something to god and hope that some day the answer will come -- it never comes, or if it comes that simply means you are hallucinating (laughter), that you are putting the question and you are answering it too. You are hearing voices which are not there, your own voices you are hearing.\nIn fact this whole attitude is insane, and religions have created a very insane humanity. Their words are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeautiful prayer. If you go into a mad asylum you will find mad people talking -- sitting alone -- and having great argument with somebody. You cannot see, but they must be seeing. They are not only saying things to the person who is not there. They are even answering from his side. And the very articulate madmen use different voices.\nIf you are listening from far away or not seeing the person actually, from a distance or behind a wall you are standing, you may really think there are two persons, but it is a monologue. The person is really a ventriloquist. But when you call it prayer suddenly it seems very great, nothing insanity in it, no madness in it.\nPrayer simply means you are talking to the sky. The answer is not going to come. There is nobody to answer it!\nMeditation is a totally different approach. It is not a dialogue, it is a silence. You are not saying anything to anybody, you are stopping the very process of thought, you are dispersing the crowd of words inside you.\nYou are emptying yourself, creating inner space. And when your inner space is totally free from all junk --\nwords, thoughts, memories, desires, dreams, imaginations -- when all are gone and you are simply there, silently there, experiencing this tremendous nothingness, that is the moment when bliss is felt for the first time. And to me bliss is the true god. It is better to call it godliness because it is a quality, an experience, not an object.\nMeditation means silence and bliss means the experience that happens in that silence. And once you have experienced bliss you have experienced everything worth experiencing, you have touched the very essential core of existence.\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Sudhiyo.\nAnand means bliss. Sudhiyo means remembrance.\nThe experience of bliss is not something that is unknown to us; we have known it. We came into the world full of bliss, but we have forgotten the experience, we have forgotten the way to it. We got lost into other things. It is just like a small child entering into a supermarket with the mother and he becomes so much interested in the thousands of things around him that he forgets all about the mother. He becomes so involved with the toys and this and that, that when he feels hungry or thirsty or some other need for the mother, he looks all around and he is in a panic. He does not know where he has lost the mother and where he can find her.\nActually, the same is the case with every human being. We come with bliss, but the world is so big and has so many things and they are all beautiful, attractive, enchanting.… It is a magic world, and every child is bound to get lost; it is natural, it is inevitable. The only thing that is unfortunate is that millions of people never remember that they came with a great experience in their being and they have lost track of it. They go on moving from one object to another object, from the cradle to the grave. They live and they die without ever becoming aware that this was not the real life. They got distracted.\nSannyas means remembrance of that innocence which was once ours, of that bliss which was once ours, of that love which was once ours.\nIt is natural to get lost, but it is not natural to remain lost. One day one has to\nrecollect, remember, search for a way back home. Sannyas is a home sickness. It is the deep feeling that something is missing, which was there in the first place, but it has been misplaced and it has to be rediscovered.\nSudhiyo means rediscovery, remembering, regaining, reclaiming. And it is there inside us. We have not lost it somewhere else, it is our very essence, our very being. So we have not lost it anywhere else, it is still inside us but we have forgotten how to go in. We know only how to go out, we know only how to do things.\nWe have forgotten how to relax and not to do. We know how to open the eyes, but we have forgotten how to close them. We know how to use the mind, but we have forgotten how to put it off.\nAnd this is the whole process of meditation: the art of looking in, the art of non- doing, the art of resting, relaxing into one's own being; the art of putting a stop to the constant noise of the mind. Then suddenly the music is heard -- our own music, our own humming sound, the sound of our own juices flowing, the sound of which we are made.\nIt is also a light, it is also a bliss, it is also a tremendous ecstasy, and once we have experienced it knowingly... The child had it without knowing it; when we rediscover it we have it knowingly. Then there is no way to forget it again. That's why I say it is natural for the child to lose it, but it is also natural to regain it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe intelligent person is one who regains it. The stupid person is one who remains miserable, searching everywhere else except within himself. He is ready to go to the moon in search of something which he has already inside him. He will not find it even on the moon, because he will be the same person. That's why I don't suggest to my people to go to the monasteries or to mountains or to the deserts.

beautiful on the inside, because the outer beauty belongs to the
physical existence. It is material, it is visible -- something can be
done about it. It is an object: you can make it, unmake it, change it,
give it a new shape -- everything is possible -- but the inner is
invisible, intangible. It is not an object. It is your very
subjectivity, it is your very being -- it is you! You cannot do anything
about it, and that is the most important thing to understand: you cannot
do anything about it, so one has to learn non-doing, one has to learn
being still, silent, in a state of utter non-doing, no effort. And in
that very state of non-doing bliss explodes.</p><p>It is not an achievement, because you have not done anything for it.
You have just to be available for it.</p><p>It comes from the beyond, it is a grace, a gift. But once you have
tasted bliss your inner world blossoms. It becomes fragrant, luminous,
and when your inner world has a beauty it certainly affects your outer
side too.</p><p>The outer can be painted in a beautiful way -- it will not change the
inner because the inner is deeper.</p><p>But if you change the inner the outer is bound to be affected by it.
The inner is the centre and the outer is the circumference. If the
centre is transformed, the circumference follows like a shadow.</p><p>But you can go on changing the circumference: the centre will not
come like a shadow following it.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Sannyas is the search for inner beauty. Your name exactly defines the
very essence of sannyas. To me beauty is a far more significant word
than truth.</p><p>Truth is dry, desertlike, juiceless. It is a logical concept. Beauty
is full of juice, life, love, warmth. It is an aesthetic experience.</p><p>God is more approximately defined by beauty than by truth, and to
understand god as the ultimate beauty is to have a totally different
kind of religion. Then it is not philosophical, it becomes poetic. Then
it is not theological, then it is not unnecessarily splitting hairs,
argument, systematising words and thoughts. it becomes creativity, it
becomes more of a dance, more of a love, more of a song, more of a
celebration.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Bill. Anand means bliss. Bill means
resolution.</p><p>Misery or bliss, both are our resolutions. We don't come in the world
with a programme, we come totally free to decide our own destiny. We
don't come with a fate, with a predetermined future. We come with an
open future. And each act defines our being, but the action is our
choice; hence nobody is responsible for your bliss or for your
misery.</p><p>This is the first step of sannyas that "I am responsible and totally
responsible." Once this is understood that "I am responsible for
whatsoever I am," a great freedom becomes available. Then each moment
you can choose to be miserable or to be blissful. Each moment both the
paths are available, each moment both the doors open, but because we
live with this idea -- and we have lived with this idea for thousand of
years that everything is determined...</p><p>First all the religions of the world gave the idea of fate, kismet,
destiny, god determines -- then we become simply puppets. All the
religions of the world have made man unfree, puppetlike. They have
destroyed the most significant phenomenon, the phenomenon of
responsibility. It is responsibility that makes you really human. All
other animals have no such freedom. They have fate.</p><p>A dog is bound to be a dog, a lion is bound to be a lion. Everything
is programmed by nature or god or whatsoever name one wants to use, but
one thing is certain: they come with a programme and they simply unfold
the programme.</p><p>It is only man and his prerogative that he comes without a programme.
This is to be the declaration of a sannyasin, this is going to be the
basic foundation of a future religiousness: responsibility.</p><p>Religions told man that it is fate, you cannot do anything about it;
hence religious societies, for example, India, has lived in a misery, in
a slavery, in poverty, in every kind of degradation, oppression,
exploitation, with no complaint, thinking that it is all determined, you
cannot do anything about it, it <em>has</em> to be so. This degrades
man, it does not make man spiritual. it makes him mechanical, and even
the people who area not religious in same way or other, have supported
the idea.</p><p>They will not use the name of god and fate, then they will say
nature, physiology, chemistry... but you are programmed still. Who
programmes does not matter. Or even people who are anti-religious,
deliberately against religion, for example, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and
others, they are again talking the same thing in different words. Only
the jargon changes.</p><p>Karl Marx says it is the society, the economic structure, that
determines. Individuality is completely destroyed, there is no
individuality possible according to communism. Even consciousness is
just a by-product of social</p><p>conditions -- what can you do? You are born in a certain social
structure and you have to follow; the way you are made, the way you are
programmed, you have to unfold it. Hegel calls it History, with a
capital H. It becomes the same: God, with a capital G. History
determines. And Sigmund Freud says it is your unconscious, you cannot do
anything about it -- what can you do? It is your unconscious. All your
activity is confined to a small piece of consciousness that is one-tenth
of your being; nine-tenth of your being is unconscious and everything is
determined from the unconscious.</p><p>Gustav Jung goes a little even deeper: he says it is not only your
unconscious but there is beneath your unconscious a collective
unconscious that determines everything.</p><p>This has been up to now, the idea around which all the philosophies,
religions, psychologies, have revolved. They are all in agreement about
one basic thing that man is not responsible, and they were thinking this
is helping man, this is taking away his burden. Yes, in a way man feels
unburdened if he is not responsible, but at the same time he loses his
freedom. The burden disappears but he become a slave.</p><p>It is better to be burdened <em>and</em> be a free man, than to be
unburdened and be a slave.</p><p>My effort here is to make you totally free! 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

act, to be one's own creator, to be one's own god, in other words, but
this is how a real being is born. And this is my own experience, because
whatsoever I say, I say only <em>if</em> it is my experience.</p><p>I am not an intellectual, I am not a philosopher. Whatsoever I say
has its roots in my own experience.</p><p>This is how one day I dropped to be miserable, I decided not to be
miserable, in a single moment (laughter) and since then I not been
miserable!(more laughter) Every day there are opportunities, thousand
and one opportunities (laughter)... Once you decide totally, once you
resolve that from now on towards bliss is going to be your very
lifestyle, you will be surprised: it starts happening! (more laughter)
For few days one cannot believe one's own eyes that it is really
happening, one cannot believe where all that misery has gone, and all
those causes and psychoanalysts were going into dreams and unconscious
and the collective unconscious --</p><p>where all they have disappeared? (much laughter) Just like that: wipe
the whole misery away, and let there be laughter and love and joy!</p><p>How long you will be here? How long you will be staying?</p><p>-I'll be here two months.</p><p>-And now ... you will be staying?</p><p>-Two months.</p><p>-More?</p><p>-Yeah, I've been here three weeks. I'll be staying (much laughter)
(lost in the visual and in the laughter...)</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Robert. Anand means bliss. Robert
means bright.</p><p>Bliss is the brightest experience. There is nothing more luminous
than bliss. One of the great mystics, Kabir, says "When I felt bliss for
the first time I thought as if thousands of suns have risen suddenly
inside</p><p>-- thousands of suns!"</p><p>Ordinarily man lives in darkness. Bliss brings the day, the dawn. The
English word "day" and the word</p><p>"divine" comes from the same Sanskrit root "div". Light is divine;
hence the</p><p>word "day", and hence the word "divine".</p><p>Light is the most godly experience. There is no god to be seen, god
is not a person, but only a quality.</p><p>When you start feeling an inner brightness, when the inner darkness
disappears, you know god is, because you <em>are</em> it. That's the
only way to know. God cannot be proved in any other way. When you
experience inner light you know. Seeing is knowing; it is not a question
of belief, it is a question of seeing. The believers are deceiving
others and themselves. No believer is religious, no believer can ever be
religious. He is a hypocrite.</p><p>My sannyasins have not to be believers. they have to be enquirers,
explorers. Sannyas begins in a certain state of agnosticism, neither
atheist nor theist, just open and available, carrying no prejudice --
that is the meaning of agnostic: one who believes nothing. That does not
mean that he disbelieves, he neither believes nor disbelieves. He simply
says "I don't know, so I am ready to explore." He starts with a state of
not-knowing, and that is the most profound phenomenon -- to begin with a
state of not-knowing. And then the day is not far away because you have
taken the most intelligent step possible. The fools are either believers
or disbelievers, either Catholics or communists, but they are the same.
Their flags are different, their popes are different, their bibles are
different, their gods are different, but their belief is the same.</p><p>Somebody is carrying the Holy Bible and somebody is carrying Das
Kapital, somebody believes in Moses, somebody believes in Marx, somebody
believes in Kaaba and somebody believes in Kremlin -- it is the same
stupidity because every disbelief is in some way or other a belief.</p><p>Somebody believes god is without knowing and somebody believes god is
not without knowing: both are travelling in the land of the fools.</p><p>A sannyasin has to drop all belief, and belief includes disbelief
too. He has to unburden himself from all prejudices so that his eyes are
open, alert, ready to see whatsoever is the case. This is the beginning
of intelligence. Intelligence is the seed of brightness, and when
intelligence blossoms life becomes divine, the dark night of the soul is
over. The day has begun!</p><p>How long you will be here?</p><p>-One month.</p><p>-That's good. Good. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anand Sankirtan.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Sankirtan means a sacred song.</p><p>Life can be lived either as a mundane affair or as a sacred
phenomenon. It all depends on us. If one is running after money, power,
prestige, then life remains mundane, then life remains in the
marketplace --</p><p>ugly, violent, aggressive, inhuman -- because all those desires can
be fulfilled only if you are cruel, competitive and violently
competitive, because life is short and the competitors are millions. And
they are all searching for the same goals: the same money, the same
power, the same prestige. So it is going to be a cutthroat competition.
Everybody is at everybody else neck.</p><p>To live a life in this way is to miss a great opportunity. Life can
be a beautiful experience, but it becomes a nightmare instead. To live
life as a sacred phenomenon one has to drop these constant ugly monsters
which are implanted by the society in our head. They are almost like
electrodes, implanted, and we think that <em>we</em> are desiring --
that's not true.</p><p>No child is interested in money. No child is interested in ego. No
child is interested in power. But we drive them towards these goals. We
educate them, we call this education. This whole process of corruption
we call it education. We make them ambitious, egoistic, full of lust for
power, and slowly slowly by the time they come home from the university
their one-third life is already wasted in programming them, and it is a
long process, twenty-five years; now to deprogramme it becomes
difficult. And if the person himself is not willing to deprogramme it,
it is impossible.</p><p>Sannyas simply means your willingness to be deprogrammed. If one is
willing it can be done very quickly, if one is clinging to one's
programme then it is very difficult; it cannot be done against you. It
can be done only through your willing co-operation, only through your
deep surrender, commitment, to have a new life.</p><p>When a man is not searching toys, when he starts really involved in
the inner search, of love, of bliss, of beauty, of truth, of freedom,
then his life becomes a sacred song. Then thousands of songs arise in
his being!</p><p>Then it is something <em>really</em> precious. Even death cannot
destroy this beauty. Death is incapable against it. Death will take away
everything that you accumulate on the outside, but that which you have
experienced in your inner consciousness is beyond death, it is beyond
time itself. It is part of eternity. That's why I call it a sacred
song.</p><p>One can sing a mundane song -- millions of people are doing that --
but those songs are not going to last.</p><p>Death will come and destroy! And when death is going to destroy all
that we have done was futile, an exercise in utter futility. The only
thing worth doing is that which cannot be destroyed by death -- that
should be the criterion.</p><p>Love cannot be destroyed, bliss cannot be destroyed, truth cannot be
destroyed, beauty cannot be destroyed, consciousness cannot be
destroyed, and these are the aspects of your <em>inner</em> diamond.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyanesh.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Dhyanesh means god of meditation.</p><p>Bliss is the god of meditation. We are not searching for any other
god. We are not searching god as a person, because there is nobody like
that. those are all just childish fantasies. The god of Christians and
the Hindus and the Mohammedans and the Jews, is nothing but our
projection. The Bible says god created man in his own image. The truth
is just the contrary: <em>man</em> created god in his own image And it
is so obvious.</p><p>Look in the Old Testament and you will find all the Jewish qualities
in god! Look in the Bhagavad Gita and you will find all the Hindu
qualities in god. Look in the Koran and you will find all the qualities
of Mohammedans in their concept</p><p>of god.</p><p>These are not truths, these are just wish-fulfilments. We are
creating our god according to our desires No such gods exits. The only
god that truly exists is an experience of bliss. And to experience bliss
the way is meditation, not prayer, but meditation. Prayer belongs to the
idea of god as a person. When you think of god as a person somewhere
there above the clouds then prayer becomes relevant, then it is an
I-thou dialogue. You say something to god and hope that some day the
answer will come -- it never comes, or if it comes that simply means you
are hallucinating (laughter), that you are putting the question and you
are answering it too. You are hearing voices which are not there, your
own voices you are hearing.</p><p>In fact this whole attitude is insane, and religions have created a
very insane humanity. Their words are 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

people talking -- sitting alone -- and having great argument with
somebody. You cannot see, but they must be seeing. They are not only
saying things to the person who is not there. They are even answering
from his side. And the very articulate madmen use different voices.</p><p>If you are listening from far away or not seeing the person actually,
from a distance or behind a wall you are standing, you may really think
there are two persons, but it is a monologue. The person is really a
ventriloquist. But when you call it prayer suddenly it seems very great,
nothing insanity in it, no madness in it.</p><p>Prayer simply means you are talking to the sky. The answer is not
going to come. There is nobody to answer it!</p><p>Meditation is a totally different approach. It is not a dialogue, it
is a silence. You are not saying anything to anybody, you are stopping
the very process of thought, you are dispersing the crowd of words
inside you.</p><p>You are emptying yourself, creating inner space. And when your inner
space is totally free from all junk --</p><p>words, thoughts, memories, desires, dreams, imaginations -- when all
are gone and you are simply there, silently there, experiencing this
tremendous nothingness, that is the moment when bliss is felt for the
first time. And to me bliss is the true god. It is better to call it
godliness because it is a quality, an experience, not an object.</p><p>Meditation means silence and bliss means the experience that happens
in that silence. And once you have experienced bliss you have
experienced everything worth experiencing, you have touched the very
essential core of existence.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anand Sudhiyo.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Sudhiyo means remembrance.</p><p>The experience of bliss is not something that is unknown to us; we
have known it. We came into the world full of bliss, but we have
forgotten the experience, we have forgotten the way to it. We got lost
into other things. It is just like a small child entering into a
supermarket with the mother and he becomes so much interested in the
thousands of things around him that he forgets all about the mother. He
becomes so involved with the toys and this and that, that when he feels
hungry or thirsty or some other need for the mother, he looks all around
and he is in a panic. He does not know where he has lost the mother and
where he can find her.</p><p>Actually, the same is the case with every human being. We come with
bliss, but the world is so big and has so many things and they are all
beautiful, attractive, enchanting.… It is a magic world, and every child
is bound to get lost; it is natural, it is inevitable. The only thing
that is unfortunate is that millions of people never remember that they
came with a great experience in their being and they have lost track of
it. They go on moving from one object to another object, from the cradle
to the grave. They live and they die without ever becoming aware that
this was not the real life. They got distracted.</p><p>Sannyas means remembrance of that innocence which was once ours, of
that bliss which was once ours, of that love which was once ours.</p><p>It is natural to get lost, but it is not natural to remain lost. One
day one has to</p><p>recollect, remember, search for a way back home. Sannyas is a home
sickness. It is the deep feeling that something is missing, which was
there in the first place, but it has been misplaced and it has to be
rediscovered.</p><p>Sudhiyo means rediscovery, remembering, regaining, reclaiming. And it
is there inside us. We have not lost it somewhere else, it is our very
essence, our very being. So we have not lost it anywhere else, it is
still inside us but we have forgotten how to go in. We know only how to
go out, we know only how to do things.</p><p>We have forgotten how to relax and not to do. We know how to open the
eyes, but we have forgotten how to close them. We know how to use the
mind, but we have forgotten how to put it off.</p><p>And this is the whole process of meditation: the art of looking in,
the art of non- doing, the art of resting, relaxing into one's own
being; the art of putting a stop to the constant noise of the mind. Then
suddenly the music is heard -- our own music, our own humming sound, the
sound of our own juices flowing, the sound of which we are made.</p><p>It is also a light, it is also a bliss, it is also a tremendous
ecstasy, and once we have experienced it knowingly... The child had it
without knowing it; when we rediscover it we have it knowingly. Then
there is no way to forget it again. That's why I say it is natural for
the child to lose it, but it is also natural to regain it.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

one who remains miserable, searching everywhere else except within
himself. He is ready to go to the moon in search of something which he
has already inside him. He will not find it even on the moon, because he
will be the same person. That's why I don't suggest to my people to go
to the monasteries or to mountains or to the deserts. I want them to
live in the world -- very much in the world, and yet going on searching

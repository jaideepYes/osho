It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Hans.\nDhyan means meditation. Hans means god's gracious gift.\nLife gives many gifts -- love, bliss, freedom, truth -- but no gift is more precious than meditation.\nMeditation functions almost like a master key: it unlocks all the doors, the doors of love, freedom, truth, awareness.\nIn the gift of meditation all the gifts are implied. It is the very essence; hence it i incomparable. Just to become interested in meditation is a great blessing. There is an old Egyptian saying that it is not the disciple that chooses the master, but the master who chooses the disciple.\nThe disciple thinks he is choosing -- on the surface it is obviously so -- but unless the master has chosen the disciple already, even the desire to choose the master will not arise.\nThere is another Egyptian saying from the same mystery school. There exited a\ngreat mystery school in Egypt. Pythagoras has visited that school and people travelled from all over the world. The pyramids were really created by the mystics for a certain process of meditation.\nThe shape of the pyramids is such that if you sit inside you can meditate for days together, you will not feel hungry, you will not feel thirsty. It has been recently discovered just by accident that few explorers were working excavating one pyramid. Their dog got lost inside and they forgot about the dog and went home. After many days they thought maybe the dog is lost. They were searching everywhere but nobody thought about the pyramid. Then they went there and they were surprised: the dog was dead (laughter). He must have died simply out of fear because he must rushed here and there and could not find the way, but his body was still warm, his body was not deteriorating at all.\nNo sign of death as far as the body was concerned. The body was protected by some mysterious 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- phenomenon.\nThen they discovered the shape; the shape of the inside of the pyramids was created for meditators.\nEven for many day or months they could live without food or water. This was the same school from which these sayings have come.\nThe second saying is that when the disciple is ready the master appears -- never before. And when the disciple is ready the master appears immediately. It is not coincidental. Just to be interested in truth is a sign that you are already blessed by existence. The basic and the fundamental step has already been taken. You will discover it only in the end, you will recapitulate only in the end, that the whole search that you were thinking you are doing, was being done through you. That's the meaning of god's gracious gift: it does not come directly, it comes in such indirect and subtle ways that the person who receives it never knows that he has been a recipient; in fact he goes on thinking he has earned it, he deserves it.\nThe people who start meditating think they are searching, enquiring. It is not so. It is existence through you or call it god or life or tao or whatsoever one wants to call it. It is something inexplicable, some energy, you can call it \"x\", which is searching through you. You are just a vehicle.\nAnd the moment this is understood tremendous growth happens, because the barrier of the ego is dissolved. Even the idea that \"I am the seeker, I am the searcher,\" is a hindrance. If we are just like hollow bamboo flutes and the song belongs to some unknown energy, and we are just passages to the song, then there is no point in carrying the unnecessary weight of the ego. It can be dropped.\nThink of meditation as a gift of god, and it becomes so easy then, because all the difficulties are created by the ego. Meditation is not difficult; the ego is the difficulty. So the tight beginning is think it as a gift. In the beginning it is only as if it is a gift; in the end you will discover that it was a gift, it was not a question of as if. But even thinking it as if it is a gift helps immensely: slowly slowly the ego gets out of the way, and meditation becomes more and more an effortless process.\nIt is no more aggressiveness on your part. You are just at the receiving end. And the very idea that it is a gift never makes you pious egoists -- that is one of the greatest dangers in spiritual search: people become pious egoists. And to be a pious egoist, holier-than-thou, is far more dangerous than to be an ordinary egoist, because the ordinary ego is very gross and on the surface, but the pious ego is very subtle and very deep inside you, hiding in the deepest realms of your unconscious.\nOnce we start with a basic assumption -- I call it assumption because it will be only an assumption right now, a hypothesis; although it is proved true in the end, but in the beginning it is only a hypothesis -- but it gives you a right direction, it makes you relaxed, receptive, available, and the most significant thing is: it makes you grateful. And gratitude helps greatly, thankfulness helps tremendously.\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyan Natascha.\nDhyan means meditation and Natascha is one of the most beautiful names possible: it means the birth of Christ. It does not mean the birth of Jesus,\nremember. It means the birth of Christ which is a totally different phenomenon.\nThe birth of Christ has happened many times before Jesus, has happened many times after Jesus, will go on happening in the future too.\nJesus' birth is a historical phenomenon. The birth of Christ is a spiritual phenomenon. The Buddha is a Christ, Krishna is a Christ, in fact the word \"Christ\" is only a form of Krishna. It has travelled long from Krishna to Christ. In one of the English languages, Bengali, Krishna is called Christo and from Christo to Christ it is very easy.\nThere is every possibility that the word \"Christ\" has its origin in the word \"Krishna\". Mohammed is a Christ, Zarathustra is a Christ, Lao Tzu is Christ. There have been many Christs but only one Jesus. You can never be a Jesus but you can be a Christ -- that is everybody's birthright.\nTo be a Christ simply means to reach to the ultimate peak of consciousness, to become crowned, to become an emperor of the inner kingdom. And sannyas is nothing but an inner journey, a beginning of a new dimension. In this dimension the ultimate happening is the birth of Christ, and all that one has to prepare for the birth -- in other words, all that one has to do to become pregnant -- is to meditate.\nMeditation is a kind of pregnancy. One becomes pregnant with the divine, one becomes pregnant with the ultimate. One carries the ultimate inside one's being just like a mother carries a child in the womb. And continuous meditation goes on nourishing the child inside: the child, Christ.\nAnd there comes a moment when the child simply transforms the very being of the person who was 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- carrying it.\nKabir has a very strange statement. He had many, he has made many strange\nstatements. He is one of the most significant mystics in the whole history, a very poor man, a very uneducated man -- he was just a poor weaver, abandoned by his parents, so nobody knows whether he was a Hindu or a Mohammedan, because these were the two religions there. His name seems to be Mohammedan.\nKabir is one of the names of god in Koran. Kabir means the great one, the vast one. His name is Mohammedan, the name certainly is not Hindu, but he was a disciple and was brought up by a Hindu mystic, Ramananda, so he was thought that he was a Hindu, and nobody knew about his parents.\nRamananda was not only his spiritual father; he was also his father in every way. He was his father, mother, master, everything.\nHindu claim that he is a Hindu, Mohammedans claim that he is a Mohammedan. His statements are tremendously significant for a single reason that they are the most absurd -- on the surface -- but if you go deep into them you will find precious treasures.\nTo explain your name, one of his statements is worth remembering; he says \"I have seen many wonders but the greatest wonder that I have seen is that the child has eaten the mother.\" Now this never happens, but it can be significant if you understand what I am saying about your name: the child grows so big, the child Christ grows so big that the mother disappears in it. First the child is small as is inside the mother, then the child is so big that the mother is inside the child. That's what he means that the child eats the mother; that is the birth of Christ when you innermost being overwhelms you, when you are absorbed and consumed by your innermost core, when your circumference is eaten up by your centre, when your circumference disappears into the centre, is absorbed into the centre, when you no more have any outside, when you are all and all just inside, just a deep interiority, with no outside corresponding to it.\nYes, that miracle happens. Kabir is right that he has seen a great miracle, the greatest of all: the child consuming the mother; eating the mother totally, not leaving even a little trace behind. This happens through the art of meditation or the magic of meditation. It is a magical art.\nMeditation simply means becoming so silent that there is no sound inside you, no word because words consist of sounds, no thoughts, because thoughts consist of words, no ideologies because ideologies consist of thoughts. If there is no\nsound, there is no philosophy, no religion, no dogma, no creed, no word at all. It is a wordlessness state. In that pure space one's consciousness starts rising, finding no hindrance anywhere it goes on rising, it reaches to its crescendo -- that is the birth of Christ. One becomes a Christ.\nI am against of anybody becoming a Christian or a Buddhist for that matter or a Mohammedan, but I am all for somebody becoming a Christ or a Buddha or a Mohammed. I am not creating here a religion or a church. It is impossible to create a religion or a church here, because somebody will blossom into a Buddha and somebody will blossom into a Christ and somebody will blossom into a Mahavira, and you cannot make a church out of these people. These people are bound to remain individuals. They cannot be part of any crowd psychology.\nThey are out of necessity, rebels. They have their original face, they never borrow anybody's face, anybody's mask. They don't live somebody else life; they live their own life. If they are roses they are roses, if they are marigolds they are marigolds, if they are lotuses they are lotuses. In my vision this is going to be the future of humanity. Religions will disappear but there will be a new kind of religiousness -- and that day when it will happen will be one of the greatest day in the history of humanity and consciousness, just a kind of religiousness, diffused religiousness.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Viram.\nDhyan means meditation. Viram means a full stop.\nMeditation is a full stop for the mind process. Mind is continuously working, day in and day out. You may be awake, you may be asleep, it goes on working. You may be doing this, your may be doing that, underneath it continues its activity. From the cradle to the grave, untiring the mind goes on and on. This is the cause of humanity's madness.\nEverybody is mad. Madness is not something that happens to few people; it is a very normal state. Yes, when somebody goes too far, beyond the limits of ordinary normal madness we call it mad, but the difference is only of degrees. Maybe the normal person is only ninety-nine degrees mad and the mad person is one hundred one degree -- just a little boundary to be crossed which can be crossed by any small thing.\nJust a push: your wife dies and wives are never reliable! (laughter) And they die\nat such a strange 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmoments... For example, they may die on Sunday and you were planning to go to the swimming pool or to the river and the wife dies! (laughter) She could have died any other day but she had chosen to die on Sunday -- now she had destroyed your (? can't get it)... and she will have a good giggle! (more laughter) Or your bank may fail -- they are meant to fail; your business may flop, anything can happen, thousand and one things are there. And any small thing can drive you mad. Just a little push, one degree more, just a little heat is needed.\nThe difference between the mad people in the madhouses and the mad people outside the madhouses is only of degrees, not much -- not of quality but only of quantity. And you can easily experiment with it: just put on the tape-recorder, close the doors and start talking to it. Whatsoever comes into your mind, don't edit it. Just whatsoever comes, even if a sentence comes only half, its okay, then another sentence comes and they start overlapping, don't be worried, don't start rationalising, putting things in a systematic way; let them come as they are to represent the sheer chaos within, then after half an hour listen to it, and you will not believe that this is you.\nIn fact nobody ever looks within oneself otherwise everybody will start freaking out. Maybe that is the reason why nobody looks in. Everybody is subconsciously aware that to look inside means to see one's madness. So they listen to Socrates telling again and again \"Know thyself,\" and they nod their heads but they never try to know. They know perfectly well that if we look within we are bound to encounter our madness.\nThey cannot argue with people like Socrates -- these people are very argumentative. Just to avoid the argument they say \"Yes, when the time comes we will look in. You are right: one has to know oneself, we absolutely agree,\" but they never try! Because once in a while even without making any effort they have come across their mind and what they have seen is enough. It is a maniac, Ayatollah Khomeiniac. It is jumping and jogging and doing all kinds of yoga postures and making faces, and it will drive you crazy if you look at it.\nSo it is better somehow to sit on top of it and pretend that everything is okay, everything is fine, everybody is saying to everybody else \"Everything is fine,\" and they are all sitting on volcanos (laughter), and everything is fine! And then somebody's volcano erupts and all others say \"Poor fellow,\" and they still go on telling to each other \"Everything is fine,\" and they know perfectly well they are sitting on the same kind of volcanos... but what else to do? Where else to sit?\nThis is the only place! You have to be yourself. Meditation simply means learning the art to putting the stop to this maniac mind -- and yes, there are ways. A full stop is possible.\nIt is just like putting the light on and off: you have to know where the button is; if you know the button it is so simple. Meditation is simple, just you have to learn where the button is. I call the button witnessing.\nIf you start witnessing your mind you will learn how to put it off or on. THen whenever you want to use it, put it on -- it has its uses. But when you don't want to use it put it off and remain in utter silence. That silence preserves energy, makes you a reservoir of energy. And William Blake is right when he says energy is delight. It is light also, it is delight too.\nWhen you are full of energy, more than you can contain, when the energy starts overflowing you it is bliss. When you have so much that you have to share it it is love. And when you come in contact with this infinite energy within you, you have come in contact with god. The only way to know that something beyond matter exists, something like godliness exists, is to put a full stop to the mind.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Anuprem.\nDhyan means meditation. Anuprem means love that follows meditation.\nThe only criterion that one's meditation is fulfilled is the shadow of love that follows it.\nMeditation we cannot see. It happens in the innermost core. Only you can go there; nobody can be invited there, nobody can be a guest there, not even you best friend, you beloved -- nobody can go there, it is absolutely private.\nBut when meditation happens inside something immediately happens on the outside too, simultaneously; what Karl Gustav Jung calls synchronicity. It is one\nof the greatest facts supporting his hypothesis.\nScience believes in cause and effect, it believes in causality -- that is its foundation: if you heat the water to a certain degree it will evaporate, hundred degrees and it evaporates. Heating water to hundred degrees is the cause. Hundred degree heat is the cause, evaporation is the effect. It is bound to follow. This is the law of causality. The whole science is rooted in the law of causality. If that is the only law then there is no 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npossibility of any love, any freedom, any awareness, any godliness. In short then there is no base for religion. Then religion simply becomes utterly meaningless.\nUnless some other law is also working -- that other law Jung calls synchronicity. It is tremendously significant. That is his one of the most important contributions.\nThe law of synchronicity says that it is not a causal relationship. Something happens and then something corresponding to it happens, but they are not related as cause and effect. It is a strange law, but it happens.\nFor example, if a husband and wife really love each other, deeply, intimately, then you will find few things happening between them which will prove the law of synchronicity: even before the husband has said anything the wife has heard it; she knows what he is going to say, she knows what he wants, she knows what is his need. Lovers start having a certain inner connectedness which is not causal, which is non-causal.\nIt happens between the master and the disciple even more deeply than it can happen between lovers, because the disciple-master relationship is the ultimate in a love affair.\nThe disciple sitting by the side of a master slowly slowly starts getting into the very tune of the master.\nHis heartbeat starts beating in the same rhythm, he starts breathing in the same rhythm. It is not causal, it cannot be causal. They start having some kind of relatedness which is not material at all.\nThere is a story in the life of a great musician of South India. He had become very old, one hundred years old and he had thousands of disciples. They all had gathered because it may be the last birthday. There was not much hope that he will survive one year more, so from far away corners of the country, all his disciples who have learned music from him -- and his life has been a long life and he had created many beautiful musicians -- they all came and they all brought many gifts, precious gifts. They were all well-known musicians, belonging to this king or that, they were all rich, respected, and when they were all offering their gifts a beggar came who was also a disciple of the master, but instead of becoming famous, instead of becoming somebody well-known in the county, he had remained a beggar. He must have been a man of different values and qualities, a rebel.\nWhen he came all other disciples who knew him they asked him, just jokingly, teasing him -- they knew that he is a beggar and he has remained a beggar, he had never accepted any post, he had never accepted any reward; he will just sing on the streets, play on his sitar on the streets, for anybody to hear. And he will never accept anything except food, and that too, only for today. So he had nothing to give to the master.\nThey just teased him -- and he was a rare musician, all other musicians were nothing compared to him, but he wanted to live a life of a vagabond, of a beggar, and he had lived that way and he was tremendously happy. He was not tethered to anything and he was not fulfilling somebody else desires; he was living according to his light. It was his joy, not his business to sing, to play, to create music.\nSo they asked \"What gift you have brought to the master?\" He said \"I don't have much, I don't have anything in fact, but still I can give something.\" They wondered what he can give so they all gathered, and when he went to the master he sat unto his feet and told the master that \"You are hundred years old, your life is more precious than my life, and I am only fifty years old, and I am certain that at least thirty years I can easily live, or maybe more: I want to give these thirty years or whatsoever is left to you. This is my gift\n-- what else can I give? I am a beggar -- you know, everybody knows.\"\nThen he bowed down in the feet of the master and died, then and there. Everybody was shocked, what has happened? And the master lived exactly thirty years more. This is synchronicity, this is a historical fact.\nIt is not a parable. The disciple must have been in deep synchronicity. This is not cause and effect. There cannot be any cause and effect in it.\nBut he must have been in such deep tune, in such deep attunement, at-onement, that the moment he said\n\"Accept my life,\" was enough! He surrendered his life and that very moment he died, instantly he died. He never breathed again.\nMeditation is not part of the world of cause and effect; it is part of the world of synchronicity. And the most significant thing that happens, simultaneously; as you go deeper in meditation inside, on your outside love starts blossoming. That is the only proof that meditation is growing, there is no other proof: those flowers of love.\nA meditator cannot be unloving and if a meditator tries to be unloving, he kills his meditation. The vice versa has also to be understood: a lover cannot be without meditation; if he tries his love is just a mask, a pretension -- it cannot be true.\nLove always follows meditation as a shadow, so wherever meditation is, love is and wherever love is meditation is. Hence my whole philosophia consists only of two words: meditation and love. This is my whole scripture, my whole Bible, my Koran. Nothing more is needed in fact. if you can materialise these 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntwo things in your life you would have known all that is worth knowing, all that is worth being.\nMa Dhyan Anugita\nThis is your name: Ma Dhyan Anugita.\nDhyan means meditation. Anugita means the song that follows it, the music that follows it, the celebration that follows it.\nMany things follow meditation. Meditation is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. It is the spring: not only one flower but thousands of flowers bloom, not only one tree but the whole forest blooms. In India we have a certain flower, palash is its name. When the palash flower opens its buds the whole forest appears as if on fire, because when palash blossoms all the leaves disappear; only flowers remain. It is really a total expression. Nothing is being held back; there is no division at all, otherwise the energy will be divided into leaves and flowers. Palash lives a total life, utterly intense. The leaves disappear, the whole energy is poured into flowers, the whole tree loaded with flowers, just flowers, and they are the color of sannyasins. This is the color that I have chosen - a very lively red, the color of the flames. And each tree has thousands of flowers, and palash always grows in forests, not one tree but thousands of trees together.\nSo when the time comes for it to blossom, its spring, then the whole forest is on fire. That's what happens in meditation : so many flowers - love is only one, awareness another, freedom still another, godliness, compassion, service, creativity, sensitivity. But all these can be put together in a single word and that is a certain quality of dance and song, a certain fragrance of celebration.\nThe person who is a meditator is in a state of dance. Not that he is dancing, only dance is there, he is not. He has disappeared into the dance. He sings but he is no more there, only the song. And when such totality and such intensity and such passion is there, life is ecstatic. And to me that is the goal of sannyas: ecstasy! Each moment a growing ecstasy, from perfection to more perfection, from totality to more totality, from one infinity to another infinity.\nNirvana now or never Chapter #13\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4470","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/>Nirvana Now Or Never</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4470 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nirvana_Now_Or_Never/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Hans.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Hans means god's gracious gift.</p><p>Life gives many gifts -- love, bliss, freedom, truth -- but no gift
is more precious than meditation.</p><p>Meditation functions almost like a master key: it unlocks all the
doors, the doors of love, freedom, truth, awareness.</p><p>In the gift of meditation all the gifts are implied. It is the very
essence; hence it i incomparable. Just to become interested in
meditation is a great blessing. There is an old Egyptian saying that it
is not the disciple that chooses the master, but the master who chooses
the disciple.</p><p>The disciple thinks <em>he</em> is choosing -- on the surface it is
obviously so -- but unless the master has chosen the disciple already,
even the desire to choose the master will not arise.</p><p>There is another Egyptian saying from the same mystery school. There
exited a</p><p>great mystery school in Egypt. Pythagoras has visited that school and
people travelled from all over the world. The pyramids were really
created by the mystics for a certain process of meditation.</p><p>The shape of the pyramids is such that if you sit inside you can
meditate for days together, you will not feel hungry, you will not feel
thirsty. It has been recently discovered just by accident that few
explorers were working excavating one pyramid. Their dog got lost inside
and they forgot about the dog and went home. After many days they
thought maybe the dog is lost. They were searching everywhere but nobody
thought about the pyramid. Then they went there and they were surprised:
the dog was dead (laughter). He must have died simply out of fear
because he must rushed here and there and could not find the way, but
his body was still warm, his body was not deteriorating at all.</p><p>No sign of death as far as the body was concerned. The body was
protected by some mysterious 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- phenomenon.</p><p>Then they discovered the shape; the shape of the inside of the
pyramids was created for meditators.</p><p>Even for many day or months they could live without food or water.
This was the same school from which these sayings have come.</p><p>The second saying is that when the disciple is ready the master
appears -- never before. And when the disciple is ready the master
appears immediately. It is not coincidental. Just to be interested in
truth is a sign that you are already blessed by existence. The basic and
the fundamental step has already been taken. You will discover it only
in the end, you will recapitulate only in the end, that the whole search
that you were thinking you are doing, was being done through you. That's
the meaning of god's gracious gift: it does not come directly, it comes
in such indirect and subtle ways that the person who receives it never
knows that he has been a recipient; in fact he goes on thinking he has
earned it, he deserves it.</p><p>The people who start meditating think they are searching, enquiring.
It is not so. It is existence through you or call it god or life or tao
or whatsoever one wants to call it. It is something inexplicable, some
energy, you can call it "x", which is searching through you. You are
just a vehicle.</p><p>And the moment this is understood tremendous growth happens, because
the barrier of the ego is dissolved. Even the idea that "I am the
seeker, I am the searcher," is a hindrance. If we are just like hollow
bamboo flutes and the song belongs to some unknown energy, and we are
just passages to the song, then there is no point in carrying the
unnecessary weight of the ego. It can be dropped.</p><p>Think of meditation as a gift of god, and it becomes so easy then,
because all the difficulties are created by the ego. Meditation is not
difficult; the ego is the difficulty. So the tight beginning is think it
as a gift. In the beginning it is only <em>as if</em> it is a gift; in
the end you will discover that it was a gift, it was not a question of
as if. But even thinking it as if it is a gift helps immensely: slowly
slowly the ego gets out of the way, and meditation becomes more and more
an effortless process.</p><p>It is no more aggressiveness on your part. You are just at the
receiving end. And the very idea that it is a gift never makes you pious
egoists -- that is one of the greatest dangers in spiritual search:
people become pious egoists. And to be a pious egoist, holier-than-thou,
is far more dangerous than to be an ordinary egoist, because the
ordinary ego is very gross and on the surface, but the pious ego is very
subtle and very deep inside you, hiding in the deepest realms of your
unconscious.</p><p>Once we start with a basic assumption -- I call it assumption because
it will be only an assumption right now, a hypothesis; although it is
proved true in the end, but in the beginning it is only a hypothesis --
but it gives you a right direction, it makes you relaxed, receptive,
available, and the most significant thing is: it makes you grateful. And
gratitude helps greatly, thankfulness helps tremendously.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Dhyan Natascha.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation and Natascha is one of the most beautiful
names possible: it means the birth of Christ. It does not mean the birth
of Jesus,</p><p>remember. It means the birth of Christ which is a totally different
phenomenon.</p><p>The birth of Christ has happened many times before Jesus, has
happened many times after Jesus, will go on happening in the future
too.</p><p>Jesus' birth is a historical phenomenon. The birth of Christ is a
spiritual phenomenon. The Buddha is a Christ, Krishna is a Christ, in
fact the word "Christ" is only a form of Krishna. It has travelled long
from Krishna to Christ. In one of the English languages, Bengali,
Krishna is called Christo and from Christo to Christ it is very
easy.</p><p>There is every possibility that the word "Christ" has its origin in
the word "Krishna". Mohammed is a Christ, Zarathustra is a Christ, Lao
Tzu is Christ. There have been many Christs but only one Jesus. You can
never be a Jesus but you can be a Christ -- that is everybody's
birthright.</p><p>To be a Christ simply means to reach to the ultimate peak of
consciousness, to become crowned, to become an emperor of the inner
kingdom. And sannyas is nothing but an inner journey, a beginning of a
new dimension. In <em>this</em> dimension the ultimate happening is the
birth of Christ, and all that one has to prepare for the birth -- in
other words, all that one has to do to become pregnant -- is to
meditate.</p><p>Meditation is a kind of pregnancy. One becomes pregnant with the
divine, one becomes pregnant with the ultimate. One carries the ultimate
inside one's being just like a mother carries a child in the womb. And
continuous meditation goes on nourishing the child inside: the child,
Christ.</p><p>And there comes a moment when the child simply transforms the very
being of the person who was 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

strange</p><p>statements. He is one of the most significant mystics in the whole
history, a very poor man, a very uneducated man -- he was just a poor
weaver, abandoned by his parents, so nobody knows whether he was a Hindu
or a Mohammedan, because these were the two religions there. His name
seems to be Mohammedan.</p><p>Kabir is one of the names of god in Koran. Kabir means the great one,
the vast one. His name is Mohammedan, the name certainly is not Hindu,
but he was a disciple and was brought up by a Hindu mystic, Ramananda,
so he was thought that he was a Hindu, and nobody knew about his
parents.</p><p>Ramananda was not only his spiritual father; he was also his father
in every way. He was his father, mother, master, everything.</p><p>Hindu claim that he is a Hindu, Mohammedans claim that he is a
Mohammedan. His statements are tremendously significant for a single
reason that they are the most absurd -- on the surface -- but if you go
deep into them you will find precious treasures.</p><p>To explain your name, one of his statements is worth remembering; he
says "I have seen many wonders but the greatest wonder that I have seen
is that the child has eaten the mother." Now this never happens, but it
can be significant if you understand what I am saying about your name:
the child grows so big, the child Christ grows so big that the mother
disappears in it. First the child is small as is inside the mother, then
the child is so big that the mother is inside the child. That's what he
means that the child eats the mother; that is the birth of Christ when
you innermost being overwhelms you, when you are absorbed and consumed
by your innermost core, when your circumference is eaten up by your
centre, when your circumference disappears into the centre, is absorbed
into the centre, when you no more have any outside, when you are all and
all just inside, just a deep interiority, with no outside corresponding
to it.</p><p>Yes, that miracle happens. Kabir is right that he has seen a great
miracle, the greatest of all: the child consuming the mother; eating the
mother totally, not leaving even a little trace behind. This happens
through the art of meditation or the magic of meditation. It is a
magical art.</p><p>Meditation simply means becoming so silent that there is no sound
inside you, no word because words consist of sounds, no thoughts,
because thoughts consist of words, no ideologies because ideologies
consist of thoughts. If there is no</p><p>sound, there is no philosophy, no religion, no dogma, no creed, no
word at all. It is a wordlessness state. In that pure space one's
consciousness starts rising, finding no hindrance anywhere it goes on
rising, it reaches to its crescendo -- that is the birth of Christ. One
becomes a Christ.</p><p>I am against of anybody becoming a Christian or a Buddhist for that
matter or a Mohammedan, but I am all for somebody becoming a Christ or a
Buddha or a Mohammed. I am not creating here a religion or a church. It
is impossible to create a religion or a church here, because somebody
will blossom into a Buddha and somebody will blossom into a Christ and
somebody will blossom into a Mahavira, and you cannot make a church out
of these people. These people are bound to remain individuals. They
cannot be part of any crowd psychology.</p><p>They are out of necessity, rebels. They have their original face,
they never borrow anybody's face, anybody's mask. They don't live
somebody else life; they live their own life. If they are roses they are
roses, if they are marigolds they are marigolds, if they are lotuses
they are lotuses. In <em>my</em> vision this is going to be the future
of humanity. Religions will disappear but there will be a new kind of
religiousness -- and that day when it will happen will be one of the
greatest day in the history of humanity <em>and</em> consciousness, just
a kind of religiousness, diffused religiousness.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Viram.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Viram means a full stop.</p><p>Meditation is a full stop for the mind process. Mind is continuously
working, day in and day out. You may be awake, you may be asleep, it
goes on working. You may be doing this, your may be doing that,
underneath it continues its activity. From the cradle to the grave,
untiring the mind goes on and on. This is the cause of humanity's
madness.</p><p>Everybody is mad. Madness is not something that happens to few
people; it is a very normal state. Yes, when somebody goes too far,
beyond the limits of ordinary normal madness we call it mad, but the
difference is only of degrees. Maybe the normal person is only
ninety-nine degrees mad and the mad person is one hundred one degree --
just a little boundary to be crossed which can be crossed by any small
thing.</p><p>Just a push: your wife dies and wives are never reliable! (laughter)
And they die</p><p>at such a strange 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>moments... For example, they may die on Sunday and you were planning
to go to the swimming pool or to the river and the wife dies! (laughter)
She could have died any other day but she had chosen to die on Sunday --
now she had destroyed your (? can't get it)... and she will have a good
giggle! (more laughter) Or your bank may fail -- they are meant to fail;
your business may flop, anything can happen, thousand and one things are
there. And any small thing can drive you mad. Just a little push, one
degree more, just a little heat is needed.</p><p>The difference between the mad people in the madhouses and the mad
people outside the madhouses is only of degrees, not much -- not of
quality but only of quantity. And you can easily experiment with it:
just put on the tape-recorder, close the doors and start talking to it.
Whatsoever comes into your mind, don't edit it. Just whatsoever comes,
even if a sentence comes only half, its okay, then another sentence
comes and they start overlapping, don't be worried, don't start
rationalising, putting things in a systematic way; let them come as they
are to represent the sheer chaos within, then after half an hour listen
to it, and you will not believe that this is you.</p><p>In fact nobody ever looks within oneself otherwise everybody will
start freaking out. Maybe that is the reason why nobody looks in.
Everybody is subconsciously aware that to look inside means to see one's
madness. So they listen to Socrates telling again and again "Know
thyself," and they nod their heads but they never try to know. They know
perfectly well that if we look within we are bound to encounter our
madness.</p><p>They cannot argue with people like Socrates -- these people are very
argumentative. Just to avoid the argument they say "Yes, when the time
comes we will look in. You are right: one has to know oneself, we
absolutely agree," but they never try! Because once in a while even
without making any effort they have come across their mind and what they
have seen is enough. It is a maniac, Ayatollah Khomeiniac. It is jumping
and jogging and doing all kinds of yoga postures and making faces, and
it will drive you crazy if you look at it.</p><p>So it is better somehow to sit on top of it and pretend that
everything is okay, everything is fine, everybody is saying to everybody
else "Everything is fine," and they are all sitting on volcanos
(laughter), and everything is fine! And then somebody's volcano erupts
and all others say "Poor fellow," and they still go on telling to each
other "Everything is fine," and they know perfectly well they are
sitting on the same kind of volcanos... but what else to do? Where else
to sit?</p><p>This is the only place! You have to be yourself. Meditation simply
means learning the art to putting the stop to this maniac mind -- and
yes, there are ways. A full stop <em>is</em> possible.</p><p>It is just like putting the light on and off: you have to know where
the button is; if you know the button it is so simple. Meditation is
simple, just you have to learn where the button is. I call the button
witnessing.</p><p>If you start witnessing your mind you will learn how to put it off or
on. THen whenever you want to use it, put it on -- it has its uses. But
when you don't want to use it put it off and remain in utter silence.
That silence preserves energy, makes you a reservoir of energy. And
William Blake is right when he says energy is delight. It is light also,
it is delight too.</p><p>When you are full of energy, <em>more</em> than you can contain, when
the energy starts overflowing you it is bliss. When you have so much
that you have to share it it is love. And when you come in contact with
this infinite energy within you, you have come in contact with god. The
only way to know that something beyond matter exists, something like
godliness exists, is to put a full stop to the mind.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Anuprem.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Anuprem means love that follows
meditation.</p><p>The only criterion that one's meditation <em>is</em> fulfilled is the
shadow of love that follows it.</p><p>Meditation we cannot see. It happens in the innermost core. Only you
can go there; nobody can be invited there, nobody can be a guest there,
not even you best friend, you beloved -- nobody can go there, it is
absolutely private.</p><p>But when meditation happens inside something immediately happens on
the outside too, simultaneously; what Karl Gustav Jung calls
synchronicity. It is one</p><p>of the greatest facts supporting his hypothesis.</p><p>Science believes in cause and effect, it believes in causality --
that is its foundation: if you heat the water to a certain degree it
will evaporate, hundred degrees and it evaporates. Heating water to
hundred degrees is the cause. Hundred degree heat is the cause,
evaporation is the effect. It is bound to follow. This is the law of
causality. The whole science is rooted in the law of causality. If that
is the only law then there is no 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>possibility of any love, any freedom, any awareness, any godliness.
In short then there is no base for religion. Then religion simply
becomes utterly meaningless.</p><p>Unless some other law is also working -- that other law Jung calls
synchronicity. It is tremendously significant. That is his one of the
most important contributions.</p><p>The law of synchronicity says that it is not a causal relationship.
Something happens and then something corresponding to it happens, but
they are not related as cause and effect. It is a strange law, but it
happens.</p><p>For example, if a husband and wife <em>really</em> love each other,
deeply, intimately, then you will find few things happening between them
which will prove the law of synchronicity: even before the husband has
said anything the wife has heard it; she knows what he is going to say,
she knows what he wants, she knows what is his need. Lovers start having
a certain inner connectedness which is not causal, which is
non-causal.</p><p>It happens between the master and the disciple even <em>more</em>
deeply than it can happen between lovers, because the disciple-master
relationship is the ultimate in a love affair.</p><p>The disciple sitting by the side of a master slowly slowly starts
getting into the very tune of the master.</p><p>His heartbeat starts beating in the same rhythm, he starts breathing
in the same rhythm. It is not causal, it cannot be causal. They start
having some kind of relatedness which is not material at all.</p><p>There is a story in the life of a great musician of South India. He
had become very old, one hundred years old and he had thousands of
disciples. They all had gathered because it may be the last birthday.
There was not much hope that he will survive one year more, so from far
away corners of the country, all his disciples who have learned music
from him -- and his life has been a long life and he had created many
beautiful musicians -- they all came and they all brought many gifts,
precious gifts. They were all well-known musicians, belonging to this
king or that, they were all rich, respected, and when they were all
offering their gifts a beggar came who was also a disciple of the
master, but instead of becoming famous, instead of becoming somebody
well-known in the county, he had remained a beggar. He must have been a
man of different values and qualities, a rebel.</p><p>When he came all other disciples who knew him they asked him, just
jokingly, teasing him -- they knew that he is a beggar and he has
remained a beggar, he had never accepted any post, he had never accepted
any reward; he will just sing on the streets, play on his sitar on the
streets, for anybody to hear. And he will never accept anything except
food, and that too, only for today. So he had nothing to give to the
master.</p><p>They just teased him -- and he was a <em>rare</em> musician, all
other musicians were nothing compared to him, but he wanted to live a
life of a vagabond, of a beggar, and he had lived that way and he was
tremendously happy. He was not tethered to anything and he was not
fulfilling somebody else desires; he was living according to his light.
It was his joy, not his business to sing, to play, to create music.</p><p>So they asked "What gift you have brought to the master?" He said "I
don't have much, I don't have anything in fact, but still I can give
something." They wondered what he can give so they all gathered, and
when he went to the master he sat unto his feet and told the master that
"You are hundred years old, your life is more precious than my life, and
I am only fifty years old, and I am certain that at least thirty years I
can easily live, or maybe more: I want to give these thirty years or
whatsoever is left to you. This is my gift</p><p>-- what else can I give? I am a beggar -- you know, everybody
knows."</p><p>Then he bowed down in the feet of the master and died, then and
there. Everybody was shocked, what has happened? And the master lived
exactly thirty years more. This is synchronicity, this is a historical
fact.</p><p>It is not a parable. The disciple must have been in deep
synchronicity. This is not cause and effect. There cannot be any cause
and effect in it.</p><p>But he must have been in such deep tune, in such deep attunement,
at-onement, that the moment he said</p><p>"Accept my life," was enough! He surrendered his life and
<em>that</em> very moment he died, instantly he died. He never breathed
again.</p><p>Meditation is not part of the world of cause and effect; it is part
of the world of synchronicity. And the most significant thing that
happens, simultaneously; as you go deeper in meditation inside, on your
outside love starts blossoming. That is the only proof that meditation
is growing, there is no other proof: those flowers of love.</p><p>A meditator cannot be unloving and if a meditator tries to be
unloving, he kills his meditation. The vice versa has also to be
understood: a lover cannot be without meditation; if he tries his love
is just a mask, a pretension -- it cannot be true.</p><p>Love always follows meditation as a shadow, so wherever meditation
is, love is and wherever love is meditation is. Hence my whole
philosophia consists only of two words: meditation and love. This is my
whole scripture, my whole Bible, my Koran. Nothing more is needed in
fact. if you can materialise these 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

knowing, all that is worth being.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Anugita</p><p>This is your name: Ma Dhyan Anugita.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Anugita means the song that follows it, the
music that follows it, the celebration that follows it.</p><p>Many things follow meditation. Meditation is a multi-dimensional
phenomenon. It is the spring: not only one flower but thousands of
flowers bloom, not only one tree but the whole forest blooms. In India
we have a certain flower, palash is its name. When the palash flower
opens its buds the whole forest appears as if on fire, because when
palash blossoms all the leaves disappear; only flowers remain. It is
really a total expression. Nothing is being held back; there is no
division at all, otherwise the energy will be divided into leaves and
flowers. Palash lives a total life, utterly intense. The leaves
disappear, the whole energy is poured into flowers, the whole tree
loaded with flowers, just flowers, and they are the color of sannyasins.
This is the color that I have chosen - a very lively red, the color of
the flames. And each tree has thousands of flowers, and palash always
grows in forests, not one tree but thousands of trees together.</p><p>So when the time comes for it to blossom, its spring, then the whole
forest is on fire. That's what happens in meditation : so many flowers -
love is only one, awareness another, freedom still another, godliness,
compassion, service, creativity, sensitivity. But all these can be put
together in a single word and that is a certain quality of dance and
song, a certain fragrance of celebration.</p><p>The person who is a meditator is in a state of dance. Not that he is
dancing, only dance is there, he is not. He has disappeared into the
dance. He sings but he is no more there, only the song. And when such
totality and such intensity and such passion is there, life is ecstatic.
And to me that is the goal of sannyas: ecstasy! Each moment a growing
ecstasy, from perfection to more perfection, from totality to more
totality, from one infinity to another infinity.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=nirvana-now-or-never>Nirvana now or never</h3><p>Chapter #13</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

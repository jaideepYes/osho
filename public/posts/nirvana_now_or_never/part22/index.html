It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Yoga Sudhiro. Yoga means the ultimate union. And Sudhiro means the wise one.\nWisdom is a by-product of the ultimate union with the whole. Remaining bounded by the ego is the only cause of our ignorance. Separate from existence nobody can be wise, but one with the existence everybody can be wise. The whole secret is in melting, merging, becoming one, but people are fighting with the whole; they are trying to save their egos in every possible way. They want to remain separate entities.\nThe very effort is doomed, doomed because of the nature of existence. We are part of it, we cannot be apart from it. We can only think, we can live in an illusion, but illusion is ignorance. The moment we drop the illusion, the notion of being separate, suddenly the discovery that 'I am one with the whole -- with the trees, with the clouds, with the sky, with the stars. And the moment that feeling arises in you it brings tremendous insight, wisdom,, enlightenment, Buddhahood.\nSannyas means getting ready to allow the dewdrop to disappear into the ocean so that the ocean can disappear into the dewdrop.\nThis is your name: Swami Yoga Ananto. Yoga means the ultimate union. Ananto means the experience of infinity.\nEgo is finite, it is very small. It is just a soap bubble; a small pinprick and it disappears. it has no real existence and because it has no real existence it constantly afraid of death.\nMan lives in the fear of death. Deep down there is a trembling, and all the so- called religions have been simply trying to console man that 'Don't be afraid; you are immortal. Only the body dies, your soul will always live.' To believe in these things does not mean that you are religious. It simply means that you are still carrying the ego and because the ego creates the fear of death; hence you are trying to cover up that fear. Because the ego is small it tries in every way to pretend to be big.\nHence the whole struggle to be superior than others. It arises out of a deep inferiority complex. The whole politics of being superior to others, the whole trip, whether through money or power or knowledge, is the same. it is the same number. Behind it all is the small ego which feels hurt because of its smallness; hence it wants to expand.\nBut you can become the richest man in the world, still, the wound will be there. No riches can make that wound disappear. You can become the president of a country, the wound will be there. In fact when one becomes the president or the richest man or the most knowledgeable man, then one can see the wound more clearly, in contrast. On the one side he can see the pile of wealth that he has accumulated, and compared to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthat wealth now he looks even more smaller than before. He looks just like an ant creeping by the side of a hill.\nThat is one of the problems every success, successful man has to face and encounter.\nI say again and again that nothing fails like success. at the pinnacle of success suddenly you realise that everything has failed, everything that you had hoped for. But there is an another route, there is an another dimension. There is no need to become bigger, richer, powerful. All that is needed is to remove the cause of this whole nonsense, to drop the idea of being finite. Disappear into the whole so that you can feel infinity, eternity.\nThen it is not a belief, then it is an experience, and it is only experience that liberates. Beliefs are all superstitious; I say all without any condition. All beliefs are blinding, destructive, immensely poisonous.\nThe only thing that releases one from all imprisonment, all misery, is experience, but for experience one needs the courage to jump into the whole.\nAnd that's what yoga is, that's what sannyas is. Sannyas is the very essence of yoga: the science of meeting with the whole.\nJust a little taste of it and all your past and its miseries and worries disappear, instantly, as if they had never existed before. it is just like waking up in the morning and the dreams simply disappear.\nSannyas is an awakening from the dream of the ego. And the moment you are awake you are not, the whole is.\nIn sleep you are, the whole is not; hence the whole science is very simple: if you want to be blissful, if you want to be eternal, infinite, deathless, then don't be, just learn not to be. Be a nothing, a nobody, and immediately you are all, you are the whole!\nThis is your name: Ma Yoga Nandita. Yoga means the ultimate union. Nandita means blissfulness.\nEgo is misery, egolessness is blissfulness. These two sutras are enough to transform the whole life. The first part is the part where we are and the second part is the part where we should be.\nWe are in misery, in darkness, in the world of the ego, but we can wake up The most fortunate thing is that it is only a nightmare. Howsoever horrible it may appear, but is only a dream. Of course when one is in a nightmare one suffers. If a tiger is chasing you there is suffering and you are running and the tiger is\ncoming closer and closer; you can start feeling his hot breath just on your back, and then you feel his hand on your back and you know you are finished, all is finished. But that is the moment when you wake up, that's the good thing, that's the good thing about nightmares: exactly at the right moment one wakes up and suddenly you find it is nobody but your husband! Who may be having his nightmare, so he is breathing hard and hot and it is nobody's hand but his hand.\nAnd then one can laugh at the whole thing. When Bodhidharma became enlightened he laughed, it is said, for seven days continuously... without even for a tea-break, without going to sleep, because he could not.\nHe will sleep and he will laugh and roll, and he would not allow even others to sleep. And they all thought that he has gone mad!\nAnd he will in every way, was simply showing that all his life that he has been thinking is a reality was just only a dream. It was so easy to wake up He is laughing at the whole ridiculousness of it all, at the whole absurdity, that how he suffered, how much he suffered, and there was nothing to suffer, but he imagined the whole thing. The whole scene was imaginary.\nAll those ghosts were created by him -- holy and unholy both -- all those dreams were nothing but his projections. his laughter is significant. He is not only laughing at himself; he is laughing at all those who are seeking and searching.\nThe person who becomes awakened has a very strange experience: he feels sorry for you and still, deep down, he giggles -- at the same time. He cannot giggle loudly because he sees your sadness, your misery, he knows that you are suffering but he also knows that your suffering is your creation and it is only the idea.But as far as you are concerned, there is no difference between the idea and the reality, so he feels sorry for you, but as far as he himself is concerned, now he knows perfectly well that he has suffered also and that was just in his own mind.\nIn fact the whole humanity is a mental case. And to come out of it is not difficult: just a little effort of tossing and turning in the bed and you will open your mind, you will open your eyes.\nAll these methods that are being used here are nothing but to bring your nightmare to a climax where 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou have to wake up. Mm? what is Dynamic mediation? Can anybody do Dynamic meditation in sleep? He will disturb even other's sleep. What is Kundalini meditation? If you toss and turn so much you are bound to wake up. You may fall from the bed, but that fall is of immense help, because suddenly you open your eyes and all those dreams of misery, anguish, hell, are gone, and a tremendous peace descends on you, an immense bliss surrounds you.\nAnd it is something that comes but never goes -- it abides!\nThis is your name: Swami Yoga Swatantro. Yoga means the ultimate union with reality, with existence, with the whole. And Swatantro means freedom.\nIt is a very paradoxical phenomenon that when we are separate from existence we are in bondage. Our very separation becomes our bondage. Of course every boundary is a bondage, every limit is a limitation.\nThe moment you withdraw your boundary, you dismantle your fence that you have created around yourself, you are free; then the whole sky is yours and all the stars. And with that freedom one can experience truth, love, god.\nWith the boundary of the ego we can live only in lies, in hatred, in evil, because we are rooted in a totally wrong conception. Our very existence is topsy-turvy. It is like a leaf of the tree which thinks it is separate from the tree. The very idea that it is separate from the tree will make it go pale, because the nourishment comes from the tree, the greenness comes from the tree, the juice comes from the tree; the very idea will become a barrier.\nThe juices will not be flowing, the greenness will not be coming to it, the leaf will start dying, shrinking.\nThe moment it drops that idea of being separate and understands that 'I am part of the tree and the tree is part of the earth, and the earth is part of the solar system, and the solar system is part of the cosmos,' then even the small leaf is as much essential part of the whole as the greatest sun. And in existence there is no\nhierarchy, because existence is one, so how can there be any hierarchy.\nHierarchy needs numbers -- somebody higher, somebody lower -- but it is all one! Hence the smallest blade of grass is as significant as the greatest star. There is no higher, no lower. This understanding releases your imprisoned splendour. Suddenly you start feeling so vast that you cannot do but rejoice, celebrate. You cannot do but sing and dance.\nMy sannyasins dancing and singing are not just dancing and singing. There is something deep in it, something tremendously significant in it. They have started feeling a deep attunement with the whole -- and that attunement, that very attunement, brings them dances, songs. And these flowers go on showering.\nOnce you are free from yourself, then everything is possible, even the impossible is possible.\nSo when I say 'Be free,' remember, I don't mean the ordinary kind of freedom, because the ordinary kind of freedom means freedom of the self. When I say 'Be free,'I mean be free from the self. Then only there is ecstasy and life abundant.\nThis is your name: Ma Yoga Premal. Yoga means the ultimate union. Premal means the loving one.\nOne cannot love if one thinks in terms of separation from the whole. If you cannot be one with the stars, one with the mountains, one with the trees, one with the rocks and the rivers, how can you be one with any other human being? It will be almost impossible.\nIf it is difficult to be one with the moon, it is going to be almost impossible to be one with any man or woman -- husband, wife, child, father, mother, brother, friend -- impossible. Because the stars, the moon, the sun, the rivers, won't create any trouble to you if you are loving towards them; if you are loving them you will find your love returning to you a thousandfold. They will function like mirrors.\nIf you can have a torch and you flash the light on the river, the mirror immediately reflects it back. It is not so about human beings, because they are not mirrors -- unless you find a buddha to love, then he will reflect because he will be a mirror. He will be just like a moon or the sun or the star or the rose\nflower: he will be simply a mirror. So if you pour love your love will be immediately, instantly returned and much more will be added to it.\nBut ordinary human beings are not mirrors; they are parasites, suckers. If you give them love they will suck it -- they are like vacuum cleaners! And not only that; they are like milking machines: they will go on milking you. And when there is a milking machine its capacity is infinite, because they are just like black-holes: you cannot fulfil their desire, the more will always be there. The more you give, the more they 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwill expect; they will never feel grateful for what you have done. They will always complain about what you have not done; hence it is really the most difficult experience in life to love a human being.\nGurdjieff used to say love starts with animals for the simple reason that if you love a dog he will respond. You can trust a dog. At least he will wag his tail! But you cannot trust human beings. You cannot even trust your self as a human being, because what they are doing to you, you are doing to them: milking machines milking each other, vacuum cleaners encountering each other -- and then you can see all kinds of calamities happening in the world. Every marriage is just a preface to a divorce. Soon the vacuum cleaners will be in the court!\nYes, human beings can also be loved but only when you have learned the art of loving -- and that art has to be learned with the whole. When you have been able to dissolve your ego in the whole, then, you can be a loving one, because now you are no more expecting anything -- not even a thank you! So you can go on giving. Of course the people you give will ask more and you can go on giving more too, because you will have now a deep connection with the whole which is infinite. You will have an inexhaustible source of energy, so you can give as much as possible. Nobody can ask more than you give; you can always give more than they can ask -- then begin with human beings, then it will not create trouble.\nTwo things more to be remembered.\nWhen you have known the union with the whole these two things happen; one, the more you give, the more you are one with the whole, the more you give, the more you have it, so giving is no more a problem but a joy. When you give your love to somebody there is no grudge, you are not waiting for any response, you are not at all interested what comes back. In fact you are not even feeling that the other is obliged to you; on the contrary, you feel obliged and thankful to the other because he accepted your love. He would have rejected it but he accepted it. He had shown such a beautiful gesture by accepting it.\nThis is one of the fundamental laws that once you are one with the whole, then whatsoever you have --\nlove, truth -- you can go on giving, you have an inexhaustible treasure. And the more you share, the more you become aware of hidden treasures behind treasures; hence it becomes a joy to give.\nThe second fundamental law is, if you give without any expectation, without any desire to get something back in return, you transform the other person. The way you are giving is bound to transform the other person because he has never met anybody like such. He has always met people who were just replicas of himself or herself.\nFor the first time the other is encountering somebody who belongs to a totally different dimension -- and that experience is going to transform the other too. The other will also become less miserly, less greedy, and will see how joyful it is to give and may start giving. In the beginning a little hesitantly, reluctantly, but soon he will learn the art that the more you give, the more you have it.\nTrue love transforms people. If Buddha transformed so many people it was because of his love. If Lao Tzu transformed many people it was because of his love. It is not a question of sermonizing great philosophies; what really transforms people is love.\nLove is my fundamental message. First know what love is and then share it, so that you can transform people into mirrors. And there is no greater joy than transforming people into mirrors.\nSwami Yoga Mangal\nThis is your name: Swami Yoga Mangal.\nYoga means the ultimate union with the whole.\nMangal means the crescendo of well-being, the highest point of fulfillment, contentment.\nOne can feel fulfilled only when one becomes part of this tremendously beautiful existence. Less than that won't do. Less than that and you will always feel something is missing. You have to be vast, so vast that the stars and clouds are within you; then there is contentment.\nWhen you contain the whole existence naturally nothing is missing. All is within you, so there cannot be anything missing. And when there is nothing missing that is the point of ultimate well-being.\nWell-being cannot go higher than that; you have reached to the very Everest of well-being. It is the pinnacle, the crescendo, and one cannot fall from it. The fall is impossible because one becomes it. You are no longer separate so you cannot fall. It is not a question that you are feeling well-being but that you are well- being itself, and that's the most significant thing to understand.\nAnything that you have can be lost, can be stolen, can be taken away. At least death will make you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nseparate from your possessions. Only that which you have become cannot be taken away. Even death cannot separate you from it.\nYou don't have it, you are it.\nHence the great sages of the Upanishads say, \"The moment one knows God, one becomes God.\"\nThe Bible, the Koran, the Talmud... don't have that much courage. Knowing God, one becomes God, because knowing God is not like having knowledge. That you can forget, that you have to remember, that you have to keep notes\nabout. Knowing God simply means that you have reached to a new quality of being.\nIt becomes part of your breathing, your very heartbeat.\nThe ultimate union with the whole simply means you have become the whole; hence that is the point when one feels, \"I have arrived. This was the goal that I have been seeking for thousands of lives. This is the home that I was searching for. I have made many many homes, but no home really proved to be a home.\nThey were only caravanserais and always I had to leave. Now I cannot leave this home because I am it!\"\nNirvana now or never Chapter #28\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3387","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nirvana_now_or_never/>Nirvana Now Or Never</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3387 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nirvana_Now_Or_Never/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

up that fear. Because the ego is small it tries in every way to pretend
to be big.</p><p>Hence the whole struggle to be superior than others. It arises out of
a deep inferiority complex. The whole politics of being superior to
others, the whole trip, whether through money or power or knowledge, is
the same. it is the same number. Behind it all is the small ego which
feels hurt because of its smallness; hence it wants to expand.</p><p>But you can become the richest man in the world, still, the wound
will be there. No riches can make that wound disappear. You can become
the president of a country, the wound will be there. In fact when one
becomes the president or the richest man or the most knowledgeable man,
then one can see the wound more clearly, in contrast. On the one side he
can see the pile of wealth that he has accumulated, and compared to

like an ant creeping by the side of a hill.</p><p>That is one of the problems every success, successful man has to face
and encounter.</p><p>I say again and again that nothing fails like success. at the
pinnacle of success suddenly you realise that everything has failed,
everything that you had hoped for. But there is an another route, there
is an another dimension. There is no need to become bigger, richer,
powerful. All that is needed is to remove the cause of this whole
nonsense, to drop the idea of being finite. Disappear into the whole so
that you can feel infinity, eternity.</p><p>Then it is not a belief, then it is an experience, and it is only
experience that liberates. Beliefs are <em>all</em> superstitious; I say
all without any condition. All beliefs are blinding, destructive,
immensely poisonous.</p><p>The only thing that releases one from all imprisonment, all misery,
is experience, but for experience one needs the courage to jump into the
whole.</p><p>And that's what yoga is, that's what sannyas is. Sannyas is the very
essence of yoga: the science of meeting with the whole.</p><p>Just a little taste of it and all your past and its miseries and
worries disappear, instantly, as if they had never existed before. it is
just like waking up in the morning and the dreams simply disappear.</p><p>Sannyas is an awakening from the dream of the ego. And the moment you
are awake you are not, the whole is.</p><p>In sleep you are, the whole is not; hence the whole science is very
simple: if you want to be blissful, if you want to be eternal, infinite,
deathless, then don't be, just learn not to be. Be a nothing, a nobody,
and immediately you are all, you are the whole!</p><p>This is your name: Ma Yoga Nandita. Yoga means the ultimate union.
Nandita means blissfulness.</p><p>Ego is misery, egolessness is blissfulness. These two sutras are
enough to transform the whole life. The first part is the part where we
are and the second part is the part where we should be.</p><p>We are in misery, in darkness, in the world of the ego, but we can
wake up The most fortunate thing is that it is only a nightmare.
Howsoever horrible it may appear, but is only a dream. Of course when
one is in a nightmare one suffers. If a tiger is chasing you there is
suffering and you are running and the tiger is</p><p>coming closer and closer; you can start feeling his hot breath just
on your back, and then you feel his hand on your back and you know you
are finished, all is finished. But that is the moment when you wake up,
that's the good thing, that's the good thing about nightmares: exactly
at the right moment one wakes up and suddenly you find it is nobody but
your husband! Who may be having his nightmare, so he is breathing hard
and hot and it is nobody's hand but his hand.</p><p>And then one can laugh at the whole thing. When Bodhidharma became
enlightened he laughed, it is said, for seven days continuously...
without even for a tea-break, without going to sleep, because he could
not.</p><p>He will sleep and he will laugh and roll, and he would not allow even
others to sleep. And they all thought that he has gone mad!</p><p>And he will in every way, was simply showing that all his life that
he has been thinking is a reality was just only a dream. It was so easy
to wake up He is laughing at the whole ridiculousness of it all, at the
whole absurdity, that how he suffered, how much he suffered, and there
was nothing to suffer, but he imagined the whole thing. The whole scene
was imaginary.</p><p>All those ghosts were created by him -- holy and unholy both -- all
those dreams were nothing but his projections. his laughter is
significant. He is not only laughing at himself; he is laughing at all
those who are seeking and searching.</p><p>The person who becomes awakened has a very strange experience: he
feels sorry for you and still, deep down, he giggles -- at the same
time. He cannot giggle loudly because he sees your sadness, your misery,
he knows that you are suffering but he also knows that your suffering is
your creation and it is only the idea.But as far as you are concerned,
there is no difference between the idea and the reality, so he feels
sorry for you, but as far as he himself is concerned, now he knows
perfectly well that he has suffered also and that was just in his own
mind.</p><p>In fact the whole humanity is a mental case. And to come out of it is
not difficult: just a little effort of tossing and turning in the bed
and you will open your mind, you will open your eyes.</p><p>All these methods that are being used here are nothing but to bring
your nightmare to a climax where 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

Dynamic meditation in sleep? He will disturb even other's sleep. What is
Kundalini meditation? If you toss and turn so much you are bound to wake
up. You may fall from the bed, but that fall is of immense help, because
suddenly you open your eyes and all those dreams of misery, anguish,
hell, are gone, and a tremendous peace descends on you, an immense bliss
surrounds you.</p><p>And it is something that comes but never goes -- it abides!</p><p>This is your name: Swami Yoga Swatantro. Yoga means the ultimate
union with reality, with existence, with the whole. And Swatantro means
freedom.</p><p>It is a very paradoxical phenomenon that when we are separate from
existence we are in bondage. Our very separation becomes our bondage. Of
course every boundary is a bondage, every limit is a limitation.</p><p>The moment you withdraw your boundary, you dismantle your fence that
you have created around yourself, you are free; then the whole sky is
yours and all the stars. And with that freedom one can experience truth,
love, god.</p><p>With the boundary of the ego we can live only in lies, in hatred, in
evil, because we are rooted in a totally wrong conception. Our very
existence is topsy-turvy. It is like a leaf of the tree which thinks it
is separate from the tree. The very idea that it is separate from the
tree will make it go pale, because the nourishment comes from the tree,
the greenness comes from the tree, the juice comes from the tree; the
very idea will become a barrier.</p><p>The juices will not be flowing, the greenness will not be coming to
it, the leaf will start dying, shrinking.</p><p>The moment it drops that idea of being separate and understands that
'I am part of the tree and the tree is part of the earth, and the earth
is part of the solar system, and the solar system is part of the
cosmos,' then even the small leaf is as much essential part of the whole
as the greatest sun. And in existence there is no</p><p>hierarchy, because existence is one, so how can there be any
hierarchy.</p><p>Hierarchy needs numbers -- somebody higher, somebody lower -- but it
is all one! Hence the smallest blade of grass is <em>as</em> significant
as the greatest star. There is no higher, no lower. This understanding
releases your imprisoned splendour. Suddenly you start feeling so vast
that you cannot do but rejoice, celebrate. You cannot do but sing and
dance.</p><p>My sannyasins dancing and singing are not just dancing and singing.
There is something deep in it, something tremendously significant in it.
They have started feeling a deep attunement with the whole -- and that
attunement, that very attunement, brings them dances, songs. And these
flowers go on showering.</p><p>Once you are free from yourself, then everything is possible, even
the impossible is possible.</p><p>So when I say 'Be free,' remember, I don't mean the ordinary kind of
freedom, because the ordinary kind of freedom means freedom of the self.
When I say 'Be free,'I mean be free <em>from</em> the self. Then only
there is ecstasy and life abundant.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Yoga Premal. Yoga means the ultimate union.
Premal means the loving one.</p><p>One cannot love if one thinks in terms of separation from the whole.
If you cannot be one with the stars, one with the mountains, one with
the trees, one with the rocks and the rivers, how can you be one with
any other human being? It will be almost impossible.</p><p>If it is difficult to be one with the moon, it is going to be almost
impossible to be one with any man or woman -- husband, wife, child,
father, mother, brother, friend -- impossible. Because the stars, the
moon, the sun, the rivers, won't create any trouble to you if you are
loving towards them; if you are loving them you will find your love
returning to you a thousandfold. They will function like mirrors.</p><p>If you can have a torch and you flash the light on the river, the
mirror immediately reflects it back. It is not so about human beings,
because they are not mirrors -- unless you find a buddha to love, then
he will reflect because he will be a mirror. He will be just like a moon
or the sun or the star or the rose</p><p>flower: he will be simply a mirror. So if you pour love your love
will be immediately, instantly returned and much more will be added to
it.</p><p>But ordinary human beings are not mirrors; they are parasites,
suckers. If you give them love they will suck it -- they are like vacuum
cleaners! And not only that; they are like milking machines: they will
go on milking you. And when there is a milking machine its capacity is
infinite, because they are just like black-holes: you cannot fulfil
their desire, the more will always be there. The more you give, the more
they 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

They will always complain about what you have not done; hence it is
really the most difficult experience in life to love a human being.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say love starts with animals for the simple reason
that if you love a dog he will respond. You can trust a dog. At least he
will wag his tail! But you cannot trust human beings. You cannot even
trust your self as a human being, because what they are doing to you,
you are doing to them: milking machines milking each other, vacuum
cleaners encountering each other -- and then you can see all kinds of
calamities happening in the world. Every marriage is just a preface to a
divorce. Soon the vacuum cleaners will be in the court!</p><p>Yes, human beings can also be loved but only when you have learned
the art of loving -- and that art has to be learned with the whole. When
you have been able to dissolve your ego in the whole, then, you can be a
loving one, because now you are no more expecting anything -- not even a
thank you! So you can go on giving. Of course the people you give will
ask more and you can go on giving more too, because you will have now a
deep connection with the whole which is infinite. You will have an
inexhaustible source of energy, so you can give as much as possible.
Nobody can ask more than you give; you can always give more than they
can ask -- then begin with human beings, then it will not create
trouble.</p><p>Two things more to be remembered.</p><p>When you have known the union with the whole these two things happen;
one, the more you give, the more you are one with the whole, the more
you give, the more you have it, so giving is no more a problem but a
joy. When you give your love to somebody there is no grudge, you are not
waiting for any response, you are not at all interested what comes back.
In fact you are not even feeling that the other is obliged to you; on
the contrary, you feel obliged and thankful to the other because he
accepted your love. He would have rejected it but he accepted it. He had
shown such a beautiful gesture by accepting it.</p><p>This is one of the fundamental laws that once you are one with the
whole, then whatsoever you have --</p><p>love, truth -- you can go on giving, you have an inexhaustible
treasure. And the more you share, the more you become aware of hidden
treasures behind treasures; hence it becomes a joy to give.</p><p>The second fundamental law is, if you give without any expectation,
without any desire to get something back in return, you transform the
other person. The way you are giving is bound to transform the other
person because he has never met anybody like such. He has always met
people who were just replicas of himself or herself.</p><p>For the first time the other is encountering somebody who belongs to
a totally different dimension -- and that experience is going to
transform the other too. The other will also become less miserly, less
greedy, and will see how joyful it is to give and may start giving. In
the beginning a little hesitantly, reluctantly, but soon he will learn
the art that the more you give, the more you have it.</p><p>True love transforms people. If Buddha transformed so many people it
was because of his love. If Lao Tzu transformed many people it was
because of his love. It is not a question of sermonizing great
philosophies; what really transforms people is love.</p><p>Love is my fundamental message. First know what love is and then
share it, so that you can transform people into mirrors. And there is no
greater joy than transforming people into mirrors.</p><p>Swami Yoga Mangal</p><p>This is your name: Swami Yoga Mangal.</p><p>Yoga means the ultimate union with the whole.</p><p>Mangal means the crescendo of well-being, the highest point of
fulfillment, contentment.</p><p>One can feel fulfilled only when one becomes part of this
tremendously beautiful existence. Less than that won't do. Less than
that and you will always feel something is missing. You have to be vast,
so vast that the stars and clouds are within you; then there is
contentment.</p><p>When you contain the whole existence naturally nothing is missing.
All is within you, so there cannot be anything missing. And when there
is nothing missing that is the point of ultimate well-being.</p><p>Well-being cannot go higher than that; you have reached to the very
Everest of well-being. It is the pinnacle, the crescendo, and one cannot
fall from it. The fall is impossible because one becomes it. You are no
longer separate so you cannot fall. It is not a question that you are
feeling well-being but that you are well- being itself, and that's the
most significant thing to understand.</p><p>Anything that you have can be lost, can be stolen, can be taken away.

cannot be taken away. Even death cannot separate you from it.</p><p>You don't have it, you are it.</p><p>Hence the great sages of the Upanishads say, "The moment one knows
God, one becomes God."</p><p>The Bible, the Koran, the Talmud... don't have that much courage.
Knowing God, one becomes God, because knowing God is not like having
knowledge. That you can forget, that you have to remember, that you have
to keep notes</p><p>about. Knowing God simply means that you have reached to a new
quality of being.</p><p>It becomes part of your breathing, your very heartbeat.</p><p>The ultimate union with the whole simply means you have become the
whole; hence that is the point when one feels, "I have arrived. This was
the goal that I have been seeking for thousands of lives. This is the
home that I was searching for. I have made many many homes, but no home
really proved to be a home.</p><p>They were only caravanserais and always I had to leave. Now I cannot

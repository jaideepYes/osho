It is for reference purposes only.]\nMa Dhyan Rabia. Dhyan means meditation; Rabia means the spring.\nMeditation is certainly the spring of the inner world, because it is only through meditation that the hidden flowers burst forth, that the seeds are no more seeds, the potential is actualised, you are no more only a possibility. You become a realised phenomenon. That's exactly what sannyas is all about: creating the right climate for the potential to become a realisation.\nIf the potential remains the potential life remains a misery, because deep down one knows -- one may recognise, may not recognise -- but somewhere deep down one continues to know that 'I am not being that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhich I am meant for. That something is missing.'\nThat missing thing keeps one miserable, unfulfilled, discontented. Meditation simply brings fulfilment because it brings flowering. The moment of inner silence, awareness, is what I mean by meditation.\nRabia also means a breeze. That too is significant. It is the breeze of the beyond. Once you are silent, absolutely silent, the world disappears, a fresh breeze, a totally new phenomenon starts happening inside you. You have transcended the material, the phenomenal. You have entered the nominal, you have entered the invisible.\nThis is what is called god-realisation. Actually it is nothing but your own potential becoming actualised.\nMa Dhyan Blair. Dhyan means meditation, Blair means a peaceful spirit.\nMeditation is just a simple art of becoming available to the mysterious that surrounds us, and the contact with the mysterious brings peace, bliss, love light, and thousand and one more things.\nPeace is not something that you can create, that you can cultivate. A cultivated peace is a false thing, just superficial. Scratch a little and it is gone, and suddenly the turmoil erupts. hence the so-called peaceful people are just peaceful if you don't scratch them, if you don't create anything that goes beyond their surface. If everything goes according to them then they are peaceful, otherwise they are sitting on volcanos, and just a small thing can trigger the whole eruption. But there is a totally different kind of peace too. It is not created, it comes; it comes as a gift from the beyond. What you have to create is a state of receptivity.\nMeditation makes you vulnerable, receptive, open, available. Meditation makes you a host. You are ready to welcome the guest from the beyond. The moment you open your doors the light comes in. You cannot create the light, you cannot create the sun, but you can open your doors or you can keep your doors closed, or even with open doors you can sit with closed eyes -- that is up to you.\nA man without meditation is a man sitting in the sun with closed eyes. A man with meditation is just a little bit different -- nothing much of a difference... He is sitting in the same sun, a same kind of person; the only difference is that his eyes are open. Because his eyes are open he is experiencing light and the splendour of light.\nMeditation is a simple art of opening the inner eye. All that you have to do is to start looking in. The only way to open the inner eye is to give it a little functioning. Anything not used goes out of functioning. If somebody never uses his hands they will go out of functioning, if somebody never uses one's eyes he will become blind, if somebody never uses his ears he will become deaf.\nAll these sensitivities have to be continuously used to keep fresh, and we have not used the inner eye for thousands of lives.\nThat's why it is not functioning; all that is needed is to start using it. So whenever you have time close your eyes and try to look in.\nIn the beginning you will find only darkness or absurd, irrelevant thoughts, dreams floating here and there. It will look like a chaos but go on watching, go on looking. We are not worried about what you are seeing. Our whole effort is to see. Remember, the emphasis is on seeing, not on the seen, so it does not matter what you see. Thoughts, desires, memories, dreams -- it doesn't matter what you are seeing.\nEverything is just an opportunity to make the inner eye function.\nSo remember the emphasis otherwise people become tired; they think 'What is the point? We don't see any light, we don't see god, we don't see the soul we don't see this, we don't see that. Just ordinary thoughts are there so what is the point? They have missed the whole message.'\nIt is not what you are seeing that is significant; the significant thing is that you are seeing, that you are trying to use the faculty of inner seeing, giving it some opportunity to function again, so the wheels can start moving -- they are jammed. so much dust has gathered they have gone rusty. Just a little use and the rust will disappear, and the dust will disappear, disappear and you will be able, slowly slowly, to penetrate the fog of the mind. As your seeing becomes more clear, sharper, your penetration becomes deeper.\nAnd once you can see deeply then thoughts are just a thin layer, just like a curtain: you can penetrate beyond the curtain, you can see behind the curtain and behind the curtain is the world of the Buddhas, the world of the awakened ones. Then a peace descends -- a peace which is unlimited, a peace which is unfathomable. And then nothing can disturb it, then there is no way to disturb it. It goes to the very core of your being, it transforms you.\nIt is a miracle, but it is possible only through meditation. There is no other way to it!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMa Dhyan Usha. Dhyan means meditation, Usha means the dawn.\nJust the end of the night and the beginning of the day -- that boundary line when the East horizon starts becoming red. Those beautiful moments when the whole earth awaits breathlessly for the rising sun: a great silence descends, everything seems to have come to a stop. That moment is very significant, not only on the outside but on the inside too, because it is the same. The outside and the inside are parallel lines.\nWhatsoever is on the outside is also on the inside too.\nIn the inner world we are living in a dark night. We have completely forgotten that the dawn is possible... but we have to work for it. We have to create the necessary situation in which it can happen. It cannot happen on its own. It is not a natural phenomenon like the outside dawn; it is something which goes beyond nature, which transcends nature.\nAnd that's what the function of religion is: to help you to go beyond the natural. Because the natural is the world of the science and the natural is the world of the inner, but for that each individual has to prepare.\nAnd the preparation is not so arduous as it has been told. It is really very simple. It is just the egoists who have been telling to people that the inner transformation is very arduous. It is not arduous at all. Yes, a little effort is needed, but just a little effort. Once you have been able to kindle just a little flame then the whole forest goes on fire.\nMeditation is the beginning of the inner dawn. Meditation simply means becoming more aware in all that you are doing -- small, ordinary activities,\ncleaning the floor or cooking the food or washing your clothes or drinking tea or going for a walk. Whatsoever you are doing just do it with a little more awareness and you will be immediately able to see the distinction.\nFor example, you can move this hand without awareness -- just as people do -- then move it slowly with awareness and feel the difference. When you are moving it with awareness there is a grace and there is a subtle joy even in the hand; even the hand feels the silence, the peace, the blissfulness of your awareness.\nAnd if all your activities of the body and the mind and the heart become full of awareness, you can imagine how much grace, how much beauty, how much bliss will be experienced. Just the movement of your hand which is nothing... You are moving your hand the whole day in thousands of ways -- just try once in a while to walk ten steps with awareness, with absolute awareness as if you have nothing else to do, just these ten steps, so concentratedly in the moment and see the difference.\nThose ten steps will give you more joy than any dance can ever give. And then slowly slowly let this awareness penetrate all your activities -- outer, inner, physical and mental, emotional.\nThe day you are twenty-four hours full of awareness, the dawn has come. And the experience of the sun rising is the experience of becoming a Buddha or a Christ.\nSwami Dhyan Aviram. Dhyan means meditation, Aviram means a continuum, a riverlike eternal process which goes on and on.\nMeditation begins but it never ends. Gautam the Buddha is reported to have said that misery has no beginning but there is an end to it, and bliss has a beginning but there is no end to it -- and he is perfectly right.\nYou can go on digging for the causes of misery; you will never succeed to find the ultimate cause.\nSigmund Freud was trying to dig and he discovered the unconscious. His disciple, Carl Gustav Jung, goes on digging and finds the collective unconscious. Now somebody is expected to dig a little more and find the cosmic unconscious, and so on and so forth you can go on digging.\nIt is like peeling an infinite onion, so layer upon layer and each layer gives you the idea as if you have come to the end. And each person who finds a new layer declares he has found the truth. But there is no beginning to the misery: you can go on digging.\nFor example, Janov has been digging and he came to the Primal Scream -- the first scream the child experiences while coming out of the womb of the mother. But dig a little more because in the East we have done much work on those lines and finally we got fed up of the whole nonsense.\nIf you dig a little more then that is not the first scream, because the child has lived nine months in the mother's womb and he had experienced all the moods of the mother. If the mother was crying he was affected by it, if the mother was rejoicing he was affected by it, because he was part of the mother's body, connected, so each mood, feeling, emotion, experience was filtering to him. He was just as much a part as your hand is part of yours.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf you are sad your hand is sad, if you are happy your hand is excited, if you are ecstatic your hand is also feeling a dance inside it. Each cell and fibre is in a dance, in a celebration -- but that too is not the end.\nIf you, even if you dig nine months in the mother's womb; the first scream happens when the soul enters in the mother's womb not when the child is born, because that is even more difficult a process.\nJanov thinks coming out of the mother's womb is painful because the passage is very narrow and the child feels tremendously crushed. He has lived in the womb\n-- it was spacious -- and then he has to pass through a very narrow tunnel. It certainly is painful but that is nothing compared to the soul entering into the mother's womb when the mother became pregnant. Then the cell in which the soul entered was so small that you cannot see it by naked eyes and entering into it must have been a hell.\nThat's what we have been working in the East and we have found that is the real hell.\nSo in the East all the mystics have been saying and praying to god 'Help us never to enter into the womb again' -- that is the prayer for thousands of years in the East: 'Help us not to enter in the womb again.'\nThey must have discovered the misery of entry. But that is not the end either, because before that you had died and death was not a very beautiful experience. And then starts another life and boxes within boxes, boxes within boxes, and there is no end to it!\nIn the East we say, before a soul becomes a human being it has to pass through eight-hundred-forty million lives. Maybe it is a little bit exaggerated... but there is some truth in it.\nEven if you have not lived eight-hundred-forty-million lives -- maybe eighty- four-million or even eight million or maybe only four million -- then too, four millions lives! It is not a, a small experience. You can go on digging. And when your human lives are finished then your monkey lives and donkey lives... and cockroaches and the mosquitoes and the bedbugs -- there is no end to it!\nIn the East we say one can go on digging: it is futile. We have tried it and found it there is no beginning to it, and Buddha is not saying without any reason. He says because he knows: there is no beginning to misery. Yes, but there is an end -\n- and that is a good news!\nAnd just the opposite is the experience of bliss: it begins but it never ends. Meditation is the beginning of an eternal pilgrimage.'\nThe first step you have to take, and then the journey continues. If you can take one step that's enough, because each time you will be taking only one step; nobody can take two steps together.\nAnd if you know how to take one single step, that's enough for the whole journey -- it may be infinite. It goes on growing bigger and bigger, vaster and vaster, but there is no end to it.\nThat is the meaning of Aviram: a continuum, endless continuum. Hence sannyas begins but never ends.\nMa Dhyan Archano Dhyan means meditation, Archano means prayer.\nI know only of one prayer and that is absolute silence. The moment you say something you have destroyed it; hence the prayers that go on in the churches and the temples and the mosques and the synagogues are not true prayers, because you are saying something.\nWhat is there to say to the whole? -- the whole knows it already. Before we know it the whole knows it.\nIt is just stupid to go on saying things to God. It is meaningless.\nOne can simply sit silently. As far as the whole is concerned, language is meaningless, language has to be put aside. And to put aside language means you have put everything aside -- your mind, your knowledge, your scriptures, your religion, your church -- because they all belong to the world of language.\nThe moment you are silent you are not a Christian, nor a Hindu nor a Mohammedan. The moment you are silent there is no Bible, no Koran, no Gita. The moment you are silent you are not an atheist, a theist, a communist, a socialist. Silence simply erases all that you have learned and accumulated. It makes you again a child, innocent, and innocence is prayer.\nIn that innocence something starts arising in your being with no effort on your part. Effortlessly a fragrance starts rising, the fragrance of gratitude.\nIt is not that you are doing it -- you are just a watcher, you see it happening. Just as perfume is rising above the rose flowers, going towards the stars, in that same way gratitude, gratefulness, thankfulness, wordlessly starts rising from your innermost core -- and that is the only prayer that is heard that reaches to God or to the whole.\nAnd once you know the prayer of silence, once you know the music of silence you have known all that is worth knowing!\nIt contains all the scriptures in it, it contains Christ and Buddha and Zarathustra and Lao Tzu. It contains 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe experience of all the awakened ones; hence I don't teach you any scripture and I don't give you any doctrine and I don't enforce any discipline. I simply persuade you to be silent because there is nothing more valuable than silence. Silence is the door to the divine.\nSwami Dhyan Vardhan. Dhyan means meditation, Vardhan means that which goes on growing, that which goes on expanding.\nPhysicists say, and only recently they have come to this understanding, that the universe is expanding every moment, with tremendous speed, with the same speed as the light moves -- and light really moves with a tremendous speed. It seems to be the ultimate speed, because up to now there has not been any indication of another speed which is more than the speed of light.\nThe light travels one-hundred-eighty-six-thousand miles per second. Multiplied by sixty that is the space it covers in one minute, then multiply that by sixty -- that is the space it covers in one hour. Multiply it by twenty-four then that is the space it covers in one day, and then multiply it by three-hundred-sixty-five days\n-- that is the speed it covers in one year -- and that is the smallest unit to measure the speed of light.\nIt is measured not in yards or metres; it is measured in light years. One light year means that much space that light will travel in one year. From the sun to the earth it takes ten minutes to travel and the closest star is four light years away. And there are stars whose light has not yet reached earth; it has been travelling and travelling and travelling.\nThe earth has been here for four-hundred million years, but the light has not reached yet. It will reach sometime. There are few stars whose light will never reach earth, because the earth was created at one point, the light started travelling, and at one point the earth will disappear, will die, and the light would not have reached yet.\nThis universe is vast! And the most amazing fact that has been discovered is that it is expanding with the same speed as light. Per second it is running farther\naway from it centre.\nThe same is true for the inner experience of meditation, for the inner universe: it is an expanding universe, it is not an static entity. Once you become silent you are amazed. You cannot believe that there can be more to it, but each second there is more and each second you think 'Now this is the end, there cannot be more to it,' and each second again, you are proved wrong: there is more and there is still more, and there is no end. It goes on expanding.\nVardhan means expanding. It is like you throw a stone in a silent lake. Just a small ripple arises, a small circle and then it goes on spreading towards the source, it goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. Of course the river has shores, the lake has shores, even the ocean has shores, so one day it will come to the shores, but the inner world has no shores, and the outer world also has no shores.. There is no boundary-line either on the outside or on the inside; hence there is no possibility of your experience stopping at a certain point. It will go on deepening, becoming more and more profound, vaster.\nThe word that we use in India for god is 'brahma', and the word 'brahma' means the expanding one.\nThe discovery of physics is very recent; just in this century, just fifty years before it was discovered by Albert Einstein that the universe is expanding. But in the East we have called god brahma, the expanding one for at least ten thousand years.\nAnd you will be surprised to know that the word in Sanskrit for god is 'brahma' and for the universe is\n'brahmand', the same word. Brahma means the inner universe which goes on expanding and brahmand means the outer universe which goes on expanding.\nThere is a possibility that what Albert Einstein has discovered is not a discovery but a REdiscovery.\nSources are lost, but the very word 'brahma' is an enough proof that the people who coined the word\n'brahma' must have known the expanding quality of the universe -- and they have called the same word for both, just with a little difference: for the outer\n'brahmand', for the inner 'brahma'. But they are made from the both, both words from the same root.\nRemember, initiation into sannyas is initiation into an expanding inner universe. You are going on a journey which will never end -- and that's the beauty of it, the ecstasy of it, the adventure of it.\nSwami Dhyan Kavyam. Dhyan means meditation, Kavyam means the poetry.\nMeditation is not a prose experience, it is a poetic experience. It is not mathematics, it is music, pure music. It is not logic, it is love.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAll this is covered by the word 'poetry'. It is an aesthetic experience of beauty, of love, of splendour. It is moving in a totally different world than the ordinary world of the marketplace where calculation is significant, arithmetic is dominant, where logic is the only god. Anything illogical is rejected, anything illogical is thought to be insane.\nBut in the world of poetry logic does not matter; what matters is love, what matters is transcendence of calculation, cunningness, cleverness. What matters is innocence, taking a jump, a plunge, uncalculatedly into the unknowable. It is not for the businesslike people, it is not for the logicians. It is only for the lovers.\nIt is only for the mad ones!\nSannyas is a jump into a certain different dimension which is not taught in any school, college, university, in fact which is prevented from growing by everybody -- the parents, the society, the church, the state. Everybody is against the heart, everybody is for the head, because head is useful and the heart is useless. The heart is as useless as the stars, use, as useless as the flowers, as useless as music. It is not a commodity. You cannot become a president of a country or a prime minister by being poetic, by being loving. You will be a loser.\nYou will not be able to become the richest man in the world. You may succeed in becoming a madman, but you cannot succeed in becoming powerful. You may succeed in being blissful but you will not succeed in any ego trip. And the whole world lives for the ego trip. Our whole education is nothing but a nourishment for the ego.\nSannyas is an effort to undo what the society has done to you. It is putting aside all the values that have been forced upon you and giving a new valuation, a re- evaluation of all the values. It is putting things in a totally different order where love is more significant than money, where dance is more significant than power, where to be nothing, just a zero, a nobody, is more significant than to be a prime minister or a president, where to be blissful is more significant than to be Alexander the Great.\nAll this is implied in the word 'poetry'. To me it is a very vast word. It does not end only by the so-called poetry. That is included in it but it is far more than that. It is a poetic way of living, of being, of existing, of relating -- and it happens through meditation. If you become silent, aware, poetry starts flowing through you. You become a vehicle of unknown forces, of mysterious experiences.\nSwami Dhyan Vikas. Dhyan means meditation, Vikas means evolution.\nNature has done its work. It has created the human being. And since it has created the human being all evolution has stopped. For thousands of years nature has not been doing anything as far as evolution is concerned. Monkeys have become man, but it seems a full-point has come, and certainly man is not contented by just being man; man is not fulfilled.\nSo this full-stop cannot be accepted. Nature has done all that it can do. It has been up to now an unconscious process of evolution. Now a different kind of evolution is needed that will be a conscious evolution. Now man has to do something to go beyond man, to surpass man. We cannot wait and rely on nature any more. That's where meditation comes in: meditation is the art of surpassing man, it is the art of becoming god.\nAnd unless one becomes god... And to know god is to become god -- there is no difference. Knowing is being!\nThe moment man experiences godliness he becomes it and suddenly there is fulfilment, absolute contentment. But this step has to be taken by man himself.\nNature cannot do it. And the reason is obvious: nature is unconscious so it has done the part that unconsciousness can do. And God means absolute consciousness: now the work has to be done by us. And unless man takes this work of creating himself, of transforming himself, he will remain stuck. And that stuckness is creating a boredom, a meaninglessness, but the ice can be broken.\nSannyas is the beginning of breaking the ice. The religions have not been able to do it. They have utterly failed.\nChrist attained it, Buddha attained it, but Christians and Buddhists have completely failed.\nNow sannyas has not to be the same mistake again; it has to become a global phenomenon and millions of sannyasins have to reach to the peak of their consciousness. It won't do that one person becomes enlightened. It has happened many times in the past and around the enlightened person a certain theology, a church arises -- and that's where everything stops -- and people start worshipping, imitating, and forget completely the real message that you have to become enlightened.\nNow no Christian thinks that he has to become Christ -- no, not at al. No Buddhist thinks that he has to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecome a Buddha. In fact if you tell the Christian that 'You have to become a Christ,' he will think that you are being profane, you are being sacrilegious: 'Jesus is the only begotten son of god, nobody else can be Christ again.' He will think that you are against Christ. In fact he is against Christ.\nSo this has not to happen with the sannyasins. It is not a church, it is not a dogma. It is a revolution.

only through meditation that the hidden flowers burst forth, that the
seeds are no more seeds, the potential is actualised, you are no more
only a possibility. You become a realised phenomenon. That's exactly
what sannyas is all about: creating the right climate for the potential
to become a realisation.</p><p>If the potential remains the potential life remains a misery, because

Meditation simply brings fulfilment because it brings flowering. The
moment of inner silence, awareness, is what I mean by meditation.</p><p>Rabia also means a breeze. That too is significant. It is the breeze
of the beyond. Once you are silent, absolutely silent, the world
disappears, a fresh breeze, a totally new phenomenon starts happening
inside you. You have transcended the material, the phenomenal. You have
entered the nominal, you have entered the invisible.</p><p>This is what is called god-realisation. Actually it is nothing but
your own potential becoming actualised.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Blair. Dhyan means meditation, Blair means a peaceful
spirit.</p><p>Meditation is just a simple art of becoming available to the
mysterious that surrounds us, and the contact with the mysterious brings
peace, bliss, love light, and thousand and one more things.</p><p>Peace is not something that you can create, that you can cultivate. A
cultivated peace is a false thing, just superficial. Scratch a little
and it is gone, and suddenly the turmoil erupts. hence the so-called
peaceful people are just peaceful if you don't scratch them, if you
don't create anything that goes beyond their surface. If everything goes
according to them then they are peaceful, otherwise they are sitting on
volcanos, and just a small thing can trigger the whole eruption. But
there is a totally different kind of peace too. It is not created, it
comes; it comes as a gift from the beyond. What you have to create is a
state of receptivity.</p><p>Meditation makes you vulnerable, receptive, open, available.
Meditation makes you a host. You are ready to welcome the guest from the
beyond. The moment you open your doors the light comes in. You cannot
create the light, you cannot create the sun, but you can open your doors
or you can keep your doors closed, or even with open doors you can sit
with closed eyes -- that is up to you.</p><p>A man without meditation is a man sitting in the sun with closed
eyes. A man with meditation is just a little bit different -- nothing
much of a difference... He is sitting in the same sun, a same kind of
person; the only difference is that his eyes are open. Because his eyes
are open he is experiencing light and the splendour of light.</p><p>Meditation is a simple art of opening the inner eye. All that you
have to do is to start looking in. The only way to open the inner eye is
to give it a little functioning. Anything not used goes out of
functioning. If somebody never uses his hands they will go out of
functioning, if somebody never uses one's eyes he will become blind, if
somebody never uses his ears he will become deaf.</p><p>All these sensitivities have to be continuously used to keep fresh,
and we have not used the inner eye for thousands of lives.</p><p>That's why it is not functioning; all that is needed is to start
using it. So whenever you have time close your eyes and try to look
in.</p><p>In the beginning you will find only darkness or absurd, irrelevant
thoughts, dreams floating here and there. It will look like a chaos but
go on watching, go on looking. We are not worried about what you are
seeing. Our whole effort is to see. Remember, the emphasis is on seeing,
not on the seen, so it does not matter what you see. Thoughts, desires,
memories, dreams -- it doesn't matter what you are seeing.</p><p>Everything is just an opportunity to make the inner eye function.</p><p>So remember the emphasis otherwise people become tired; they think
'What is the point? We don't see any light, we don't see god, we don't
see the soul we don't see this, we don't see that. Just ordinary
thoughts are there so what is the point? They have missed the whole
message.'</p><p>It is not what you are seeing that is significant; the significant
thing is that you are seeing, that you are trying to use the faculty of
inner seeing, giving it some opportunity to function again, so the
wheels can start moving -- they are jammed. so much dust has gathered
they have gone rusty. Just a little use and the rust will disappear, and
the dust will disappear, disappear and you will be able, slowly slowly,
to penetrate the fog of the mind. As your seeing becomes more clear,
sharper, your penetration becomes deeper.</p><p>And once you can see deeply then thoughts are just a thin layer, just
like a curtain: you can penetrate beyond the curtain, you can see behind
the curtain and behind the curtain is the world of the Buddhas, the
world of the awakened ones. Then a peace descends -- a peace which is
unlimited, a peace which is unfathomable. And then nothing can disturb
it, then there is no way to disturb it. It goes to the very core of your
being, it transforms you.</p><p>It is a miracle, but it is possible only through meditation. There is
no other way to it!</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Ma Dhyan Usha. Dhyan means meditation, Usha means the dawn.</p><p>Just the end of the night and the beginning of the day -- that
boundary line when the East horizon starts becoming red. Those beautiful
moments when the whole earth awaits breathlessly for the rising sun: a
great silence descends, everything seems to have come to a stop. That
moment is very significant, not only on the outside but on the inside
too, because it is the same. The outside and the inside are parallel
lines.</p><p>Whatsoever is on the outside is also on the inside too.</p><p>In the inner world we are living in a dark night. We have completely
forgotten that the dawn is possible... but we have to work for it. We
have to create the necessary situation in which it can happen. It cannot
happen on its own. It is not a natural phenomenon like the outside dawn;
it is something which goes beyond nature, which transcends nature.</p><p>And that's what the function of religion is: to help you to go beyond
the natural. Because the natural is the world of the science and the
natural is the world of the inner, but for that each individual has to
prepare.</p><p>And the preparation is not so arduous as it has been told. It is
really very simple. It is just the egoists who have been telling to
people that the inner transformation is very arduous. It is not arduous
at all. Yes, a little effort is needed, but just a little effort. Once
you have been able to kindle just a little flame then the whole forest
goes on fire.</p><p>Meditation is the beginning of the inner dawn. Meditation simply
means becoming more aware in <em>all</em> that you are doing -- small,
ordinary activities,</p><p>cleaning the floor or cooking the food or washing your clothes or
drinking tea or going for a walk. Whatsoever you are doing just do it
with a little more awareness and you will be immediately able to see the
distinction.</p><p>For example, you can move this hand without awareness -- just as
people do -- then move it slowly with awareness and feel the difference.
When you are moving it with awareness there is a grace and there is a
subtle joy even in the hand; even the hand feels the silence, the peace,
the blissfulness of your awareness.</p><p>And if all your activities of the body and the mind and the heart
become full of awareness, you can imagine how much grace, how much
beauty, how much bliss will be experienced. Just the movement of your
hand which is nothing... You are moving your hand the whole day in
thousands of ways -- just try once in a while to walk ten steps with
awareness, with absolute awareness as if you have nothing else to do,
just these ten steps, so concentratedly in the moment and see the
difference.</p><p>Those ten steps will give you more joy than any dance can ever give.
And then slowly slowly let this awareness penetrate all your activities
-- outer, inner, physical and mental, emotional.</p><p>The day you are twenty-four hours full of awareness, the dawn has
come. And the experience of the sun rising is the experience of becoming
a Buddha or a Christ.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Aviram. Dhyan means meditation, Aviram means a continuum,
a riverlike eternal process which goes on and on.</p><p>Meditation begins but it never ends. Gautam the Buddha is reported to
have said that misery has no beginning but there is an end to it, and
bliss has a beginning but there is no end to it -- and he is perfectly
right.</p><p>You can go on digging for the causes of misery; you will never
succeed to find the ultimate cause.</p><p>Sigmund Freud was trying to dig and he discovered the unconscious.
His disciple, Carl Gustav Jung, goes on digging and finds the collective
unconscious. Now somebody is expected to dig a little more and find the
cosmic unconscious, and so on and so forth you can go on digging.</p><p>It is like peeling an infinite onion, so layer upon layer and each
layer gives you the idea as if you have come to the end. And each person
who finds a new layer declares he has found the truth. But there is no
beginning to the misery: you can go on digging.</p><p>For example, Janov has been digging and he came to the Primal Scream
-- the first scream the child experiences while coming out of the womb
of the mother. But dig a little more because in the East we have done
much work on those lines and finally we got fed up of the whole
nonsense.</p><p>If you dig a little more then that is not the first scream, because
the child has lived nine months in the mother's womb and he had
experienced all the moods of the mother. If the mother was crying he was
affected by it, if the mother was rejoicing he was affected by it,
because he was part of the mother's body, connected, so each mood,
feeling, emotion, experience was filtering to him. He was just as much a
part as your hand is part of yours.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>If you are sad your hand is sad, if you are happy your hand is
excited, if you are ecstatic your hand is also feeling a dance inside
it. Each cell and fibre is in a dance, in a celebration -- but that too
is not the end.</p><p>If you, even if you dig nine months in the mother's womb; the first
scream happens when the soul enters in the mother's womb not when the
child is born, because that is even more difficult a process.</p><p>Janov thinks coming out of the mother's womb is painful because the
passage is very narrow and the child feels tremendously crushed. He has
lived in the womb</p><p>-- it was spacious -- and then he has to pass through a very narrow
tunnel. It certainly <em>is</em> painful but that is nothing compared to
the soul entering into the mother's womb when the mother became
pregnant. Then the cell in which the soul entered was so small that you
cannot see it by naked eyes and entering into it must have been a
hell.</p><p>That's what we have been working in the East and we have found that
is the real hell.</p><p>So in the East all the mystics have been saying and praying to god
'Help us <em>never</em> to enter into the womb again' -- that is the
prayer for thousands of years in the East: 'Help us not to enter in the
womb again.'</p><p>They must have discovered the misery of entry. But that is not the
end either, because before that you had died and death was not a very
beautiful experience. And then starts another life and boxes within
boxes, boxes within boxes, and there is no end to it!</p><p>In the East we say, before a soul becomes a human being it has to
pass through eight-hundred-forty million lives. Maybe it is a little bit
exaggerated... but there is some truth in it.</p><p>Even if you have not lived eight-hundred-forty-million lives -- maybe
eighty- four-million or even eight million or maybe only four million --
then too, four millions lives! It is not a, a small experience. You can
go on digging. And when your human lives are finished then your monkey
lives and donkey lives... and cockroaches and the mosquitoes and the
bedbugs -- there is no end to it!</p><p>In the East we say one can go on digging: it is futile. We have tried
it and found it there is no beginning to it, and Buddha is not saying
without any reason. He says because he knows: there is no beginning to
misery. Yes, but there is an end -</p><p>- and that is a good news!</p><p>And just the opposite is the experience of bliss: it begins but it
never ends. Meditation is the beginning of an eternal pilgrimage.'</p><p>The first step <em>you</em> have to take, and then the journey
continues. If you can take one step that's enough, because each time you
will be taking only one step; nobody can take two steps together.</p><p>And if you know how to take <em>one</em> single step, that's enough
for the whole journey -- it may be infinite. It goes on growing bigger
and bigger, vaster and vaster, but there is no end to it.</p><p>That is the meaning of Aviram: a continuum, endless continuum. Hence
sannyas begins but never ends.</p><p>Ma Dhyan Archano Dhyan means meditation, Archano means prayer.</p><p>I know only of one prayer and that is absolute silence. The moment
you say something you have destroyed it; hence the prayers that go on in
the churches and the temples and the mosques and the synagogues are not
true prayers, because you are saying something.</p><p>What is there to say to the whole? -- the whole knows it already.
Before we know it the whole knows it.</p><p>It is just stupid to go on saying things to God. It is
meaningless.</p><p>One can simply sit silently. As far as the whole is concerned,
language is meaningless, language has to be put aside. And to put aside
language means you have put everything aside -- your mind, your
knowledge, your scriptures, your religion, your church -- because they
all belong to the world of language.</p><p>The moment you are silent you are not a Christian, nor a Hindu nor a
Mohammedan. The moment you are silent there is no Bible, no Koran, no
Gita. The moment you are silent you are not an atheist, a theist, a
communist, a socialist. Silence simply erases all that you have learned
and accumulated. It makes you again a child, innocent, and innocence is
prayer.</p><p>In that innocence something starts arising in your being with no
effort on your part. Effortlessly a fragrance starts rising, the
fragrance of gratitude.</p><p>It is not that you are doing it -- you are just a watcher, you see it
happening. Just as perfume is rising above the rose flowers, going
towards the stars, in that same way gratitude, gratefulness,
thankfulness, wordlessly starts rising from your innermost core -- and
that is the only prayer that is heard that reaches to God or to the
whole.</p><p>And once you know the prayer of silence, once you know the music of
silence you have known all that is worth knowing!</p><p>It contains all the scriptures in it, it contains Christ and Buddha
and Zarathustra and Lao Tzu. It contains 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

scripture and I don't give you any doctrine and I don't enforce any
discipline. I simply persuade you to be silent because there is nothing
more valuable than silence. Silence is the door to the divine.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Vardhan. Dhyan means meditation, Vardhan means that which
goes on growing, that which goes on expanding.</p><p>Physicists say, and only recently they have come to this
understanding, that the universe is expanding every moment, with
tremendous speed, with the same speed as the light moves -- and light
really moves with a tremendous speed. It seems to be the ultimate speed,
because up to now there has not been any indication of another speed
which is more than the speed of light.</p><p>The light travels one-hundred-eighty-six-thousand miles per second.
Multiplied by sixty that is the space it covers in one minute, then
multiply that by sixty -- that is the space it covers in one hour.
Multiply it by twenty-four then that is the space it covers in one day,
and then multiply it by three-hundred-sixty-five days</p><p>-- that is the speed it covers in one year -- and that is the
smallest unit to measure the speed of light.</p><p>It is measured not in yards or metres; it is measured in light years.
One light year means that much space that light will travel in one year.
From the sun to the earth it takes ten minutes to travel and the closest
star is four light years away. And there are stars whose light has not
yet reached earth; it has been travelling and travelling and
travelling.</p><p>The earth has been here for four-hundred million years, but the light
has not reached yet. It will reach sometime. There are few stars whose
light will never reach earth, because the earth was created at one
point, the light started travelling, and at one point the earth will
disappear, will die, and the light would not have reached yet.</p><p>This universe is vast! And the most amazing fact that has been
discovered is that it is expanding with the same speed as light. Per
second it is running farther</p><p>away from it centre.</p><p>The same is true for the inner experience of meditation, for the
inner universe: it is an expanding universe, it is not an static entity.
Once you become silent you are amazed. You cannot believe that there can
be more to it, but each second there is more and each second you think
'Now this is the end, there cannot be more to it,' and each second
again, you are proved wrong: there is more and there is still more, and
there is no end. It goes on expanding.</p><p>Vardhan means expanding. It is like you throw a stone in a silent
lake. Just a small ripple arises, a small circle and then it goes on
spreading towards the source, it goes on becoming bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger. Of course the river has shores, the lake has shores,
even the ocean has shores, so one day it will come to the shores, but
the inner world has no shores, and the outer world also has no shores..
There is no boundary-line either on the outside or on the inside; hence
there is no possibility of your experience stopping at a certain point.
It will go on deepening, becoming more and more profound, vaster.</p><p>The word that we use in India for god is 'brahma', and the word
'brahma' means the expanding one.</p><p>The discovery of physics is very recent; just in this century, just
fifty years before it was discovered by Albert Einstein that the
universe is expanding. But in the East we have called god brahma, the
expanding one for at least ten thousand years.</p><p>And you will be surprised to know that the word in Sanskrit for god
is 'brahma' and for the universe is</p><p>'brahmand', the same word. Brahma means the inner universe which goes
on expanding and brahmand means the outer universe which goes on
expanding.</p><p>There is a possibility that what Albert Einstein has discovered is
not a discovery but a REdiscovery.</p><p>Sources are lost, but the very word 'brahma' is an enough proof that
the people who coined the word</p><p>'brahma' must have known the expanding quality of the universe -- and
they have called the same word for both, just with a little difference:
for the outer</p><p>'brahmand', for the inner 'brahma'. But they are made from the both,
both words from the same root.</p><p>Remember, initiation into sannyas is initiation into an expanding
inner universe. You are going on a journey which will never end -- and
that's the beauty of it, the ecstasy of it, the adventure of it.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Kavyam. Dhyan means meditation, Kavyam means the
poetry.</p><p>Meditation is not a prose experience, it is a poetic experience. It
is not mathematics, it is music, pure music. It is not logic, it is
love.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>All this is covered by the word 'poetry'. It is an aesthetic
experience of beauty, of love, of splendour. It is moving in a totally
different world than the ordinary world of the marketplace where
calculation is significant, arithmetic is dominant, where logic is the
only god. Anything illogical is rejected, anything illogical is thought
to be insane.</p><p>But in the world of poetry logic does not matter; what matters is
love, what matters is transcendence of calculation, cunningness,
cleverness. What matters is innocence, taking a jump, a plunge,
uncalculatedly into the unknowable. It is not for the businesslike
people, it is not for the logicians. It is only for the lovers.</p><p>It is only for the mad ones!</p><p>Sannyas is a jump into a certain different dimension which is not
taught in any school, college, university, in fact which is prevented
from growing by everybody -- the parents, the society, the church, the
state. Everybody is against the heart, everybody is for the head,
because head is useful and the heart is useless. The heart is as useless
as the stars, use, as useless as the flowers, as useless as music. It is
not a commodity. You cannot become a president of a country or a prime
minister by being poetic, by being loving. You will be a loser.</p><p>You will not be able to become the richest man in the world. You may
succeed in becoming a madman, but you cannot succeed in becoming
powerful. You may succeed in being blissful but you will not succeed in
any ego trip. And the whole world lives for the ego trip. Our whole
education is nothing but a nourishment for the ego.</p><p>Sannyas is an effort to undo what the society has done to you. It is
putting aside all the values that have been forced upon you and giving a
new valuation, a re- evaluation of all the values. It is putting things
in a totally different order where love is more significant than money,
where dance is more significant than power, where to be nothing, just a
zero, a nobody, is more significant than to be a prime minister or a
president, where to be blissful is more significant than to be Alexander
the Great.</p><p>All this is implied in the word 'poetry'. To me it is a very vast
word. It does not end only by the so-called poetry. That is included in
it but it is far more than that. It is a poetic way of living, of being,
of existing, of relating -- and it happens through meditation. If you
become silent, aware, poetry starts flowing through you. You become a
vehicle of unknown forces, of mysterious experiences.</p><p>Swami Dhyan Vikas. Dhyan means meditation, Vikas means evolution.</p><p>Nature has done its work. It has created the human being. And since
it has created the human being all evolution has stopped. For thousands
of years nature has not been doing anything as far as evolution is
concerned. Monkeys have become man, but it seems a full-point has come,
and certainly man is not contented by just being man; man is not
fulfilled.</p><p>So this full-stop cannot be accepted. Nature has done all that it can
do. It has been up to now an unconscious process of evolution. Now a
different kind of evolution is needed that will be a conscious
evolution. Now man has to do something to go beyond man, to surpass man.
We cannot wait and rely on nature any more. That's where meditation
comes in: meditation is the art of surpassing man, it is the art of
becoming god.</p><p>And unless one becomes god... And to know god is to become god --
there is no difference. Knowing is being!</p><p>The moment man experiences godliness he becomes it and suddenly there
is fulfilment, absolute contentment. But this step has to be taken by
man himself.</p><p>Nature cannot do it. And the reason is obvious: nature is unconscious
so it has done the part that unconsciousness can do. And God means
absolute consciousness: now the work has to be done by us. And unless
man takes this work of creating himself, of transforming himself, he
will remain stuck. And that stuckness is creating a boredom, a
meaninglessness, but the ice can be broken.</p><p>Sannyas is the beginning of breaking the ice. The religions have not
been able to do it. They have utterly failed.</p><p>Christ attained it, Buddha attained it, but Christians and Buddhists
have completely failed.</p><p>Now sannyas has not to be the same mistake again; it has to become a
global phenomenon and millions of sannyasins have to reach to the peak
of their consciousness. It won't do that one person becomes enlightened.
It has happened many times in the past and around the enlightened person
a certain theology, a church arises -- and that's where everything stops
-- and people start worshipping, imitating, and forget completely the
real message that <em>you</em> have to become enlightened.</p><p>Now no Christian thinks that he has to become Christ -- no, not at
al. No Buddhist thinks that he has to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

become a Christ,' he will think that you are being profane, you are
being sacrilegious: 'Jesus is the only begotten son of god, nobody else
can be Christ again.' He will think that you are against Christ. In fact
<em>he</em> is against Christ.</p><p>So this has not to happen with the sannyasins. It is not a church, it
is not a dogma. It is a revolution. And I am not giving you any
principles to live by; just an insight so that you can be conscious. And
out of your consciousness you have to live -- that has to be

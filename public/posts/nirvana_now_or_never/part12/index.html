Runa means mysterious.\nLife can be approached either through the mind or through a state of no-mind. These are the only two alternative approaches.\nScience approaches life through the mind, religion through the no-mind; hence science comes only to know the superficial, the factual, the mathematical, the measurable. Its very approach prohibits it to enter into the mysterious. Its very presupposition is against the mysterious.\nScience has been endeavouring to demystify existence. That's its aim. It is not\nsaid so obviously but if you look into scientific researches, discoveries, it is not difficult to find the essential core. Science is trying to find answers for every question possible. It divides existence into two categories: the known and the unknown. That which is known today was unkown yesterday. That which is unknown today will become known tomorrow. That's the only difference between the two. There is no basic difference, no qualitative difference; only a difference of quantity.\nA little more effort, a little more work, a little more research and a day is not far away when all will become known. The unknown is being reduced slowly into the known, the unknown is becoming less and less and the known is becoming bigger and bigger. Soon the whole territory will be known. That's the goal of science. In other words that's what I call demystification.\nBut we are moving towards a very dangerous state. If it is all becomes possible, that all is known, life will become absolutely futile. Life's meaning is in its mystery, but science prohibits it. Its very methodology debars it, makes it blind for the mysterious. The mysterious is a third category; it does not come under the category of the known nor under the category of the unknown; it belongs to the totally different category: the unknowable -- and that is the dimension of religion, the unknowable.\nIt cannot be known but it can be experienced. It cannot be known but it can be lived. You cannot reduce it into an answer, into a system of thought, into a logical proposition, into a philosophy. It is vast, it is infinite, it is eternal, but you can drink of it, you can become utterly drunk with it, you can dance it, you can sing it. You can love it, but knowing is not possible.\nAnd to move towards the unknowable you have to make a great change within yourself: you have to move you energy from the mind to a state of no-mind. That's what I call meditation. Meditation simply means putting the mind aside, looking into reality without any idea what it is, without any presupposition\n,without any a priori knowledge, looking into existence innocently like a small child. That very look becomes a transformation. That seeing with innocent heart, with wonder in your eyes, with a deep overwhelming awe, and you are falling in tune with the mysterious, you are moving beyond the known and the unknown, towards the unknowable.\nGod is another name for the unknowable; so is truth, so is love, so is beauty. Different names but indicating to the same moon. Different fingers pointing to the same moon.\nThis is your name: Ma Veet Cecile.\nVeet means transcendence, surpassing, going beyond. Cecile means blind.\nEverybody is born blind, but with the capacity to go beyond it, with the potential to transcend it. Very few people have transcended the blindness, for the simple reason because they take it for granted that this is what life is all about. They misunderstand birth with life. Birth is not life, neither birth is the beginning of life nor the death its end. Life is not something between birth and death; on the contrary, birth and death are just small episodes in the long journey of life. Many times birth has happened, many times death has happened: life continues unhindered, undistracted.\nSo those who take birth as if this is life will remain blind, and then they are bound to be continuously afraid and trembling about death, because if birth is life, then death is the end. One fallacy leads to another fallacy, and between these two fallacies -- birth and death -- the whole opportunity is lost. Between birth and death there is only an opportunity to realise your potential. But it is not given.\nThe seed is there but the seed is not the flower. The seed contains the flower. If you cut the seed you will not find the flower; you have to find right soil, right climate, right time, so that the seed can die and disappear into the soil and can become a plant.\nOnce the seed has started growing, the seed has lost its blindness. The seed is blind. It is completely closed from everywhere. It lives in a kind of grave, encapsulated, but the tree is not encapsulated. It has come out of the grave. It is alive, it is open -- open to the sun, open to the moon, open to the stars. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\navailable to the wind, to the rain, to the songs of the birds. It is vulnerable. It sways and dances and rejoices.\nIt has moods of sadness, of joy. Yes, there are moments of mourning and moments of festivity.\nNow these are scientific facts, even science has become aware about the living element in the trees which is very sensitive, ultimately of the same category as man; a different expression of consciousness, a different form of sensitivity, different kind of eyes, different kind of ears, but the tree hears, the tree sees, the tree feels. When you touch it with love it recognises your warmth, it responds. When you come with an axe to cut it, it shivers, trembles, it knows the enemy and the friend, it knows the lover, it knows just the bypasser. It has its own eyes.\nEvery man is born as a seed and every man has the capacity to become a rosebush with hundreds of roses available to existence, in communion with existence. That's what I call the eyes. When you are blossoming then you have many eyes, because existence is multidimensional.\nThese two eyes that we have are nothing. That is only one small dimension, the physiological, but there are many dimensions, many planes, many aspects of reality. And if a man works upon one's own energies, he starts growing many kinds of eyes. He starts becoming perceptive in thousand and one ways.\nWhen you have reached to the optimum of your potential, when you have realised all that was unrealised in you, then we call, one is enlightened, awakened, is a Christ or is a Buddha.\nYour name is significant; it is the situation -- everybody is born blind, but there is no need to stop there.\nIn fact it should become a challenge to go beyond it. If a person can know that \"I am blind,\" then he is bound to do something about it. The moment one knows \"I am ignorant,\" he has already taken a very significant step towards knowing, because nobody wants to be ignorant, nobody wants to be blind, nobody wants to be unconscious, mechanical, robotlike. That is not our nature, that is not our fulfilment. Everybody wants to grow in consciousness, awareness; only then slowly slowly bliss arises, love arises, freedom arises.\nThese are all the flowers, these are all different eyes.\nAnd when you are able to see all that is possible to be seen, then only there is contentment, immense contentment, and great gratitude for existence. To me that gratitude is prayer, and that contentment is the goal of all religion.\nThis is your name: Swami Purnam Seth.\nPurnam means the perfect, the ultimate, the absolute, the whole. Seth means the appointed.\nWe are all appointed by the whole; and life should not be thought as an accident. That's what science goes on telling to every child. It is unfortunate that the children from their very small age are being conditioned with a very wrong attitude which is going to darken their whole life. And from the Kg to the university this is the climate, that life is accidental, that there is no meaning in existence, that we are just by-products of accidental situations, that we are not needed really. If we disappear nothing is lost; if we are nothing is added.\nThe whole existence according to the scientific attitude is accidental. There is no intrinsic significance.\nIt is a chaos according to science, not a cosmos. Cosmos needs some meaning, some intrinsic truth. It is only through religious experience that this chaos is transformed into a cosmos.\nReligion gives meaning, significance, a sense of being needed. And remember: it is one of the greatest needs in life, to be needed. And if one can feel that \"The whole existence needs me,\" that \"I am here not by accident,\" that \"I am appointed to be here,\" that \"I have a certain message to deliver,\" that \"I have to fulfil a certain mission,\" that \"My life has to deliver, contribute, something beautiful to existence, only then I will feel fulfilled, only then I will feel I have done my work\" -- and the joy that comes when you have done any work to perfection; any work in which you have put your total heart.\nWhen you have done it well, finished it well, a great ecstasy arises. It is my observation that only creative people know what ecstasy is. And by creativity I mean fulfilling something hidden in you, discovering it and fulfilling it in your life. Then you have contributed, you have added some beauty to the existence, some joy.\nExistence is a little more enriched by you that it was before you. You will be\nleaving existence a little better, a little higher, a little more poetic, a little more magical, a little more golden than you have found it when you had arrived. That is fulfillment, that's ecstasy.\nThe experience comes as you become silent. The more silent you become, the more you start feeling the hands of the ultimate behind you. When you are totally silent you suddenly some to see that you are just a bamboo flute on the lips of the ultimate: the song is flowing through you. Your only work is not to hinder it, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnot to distort it; to allow it pass through you, in its purity. As it is, it should be delivered.\nSannyas means living a life of pure silence, living life through silence, and then this is the first experience that comes to oneself, that \"I am part of a great cosmic plan,\" that \"I belong to an organic universe,\" that \"I am not just a cog in a wheel, that any other cog can replace me.\" In fact nobody is replaceable, everybody is unique. The moment it is felt, life comes to its ultimate peak of rejoicing.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Henry. Anand means bliss. Henry means home.\nThe deepest desire in every heart is to find bliss; a bliss that is eternal, a bliss that comes but never goes, a bliss that is forever. But we all are groping, not knowing where to go, there to find it, not knowing what direction is the right direction, what path to follow. But in darkness, in blindness, still, we all are groping.\nThe drunkard is groping, the gambler is groping, the priest is groping, the philosopher is groping, the saint is groping -- they are all groping -- in different ways, in different corners.\nMy only teaching here is that before you start groping create some awareness. Don't waste your time in groping. First requirement is to be alert, aware, watchful, because awareness is a kind of light inside. Once you have the light, even if it is a small candle, you can find the way. You can find the door out of the mess you are, out of the misery you are, you can find the door to the temple of bliss. But the basic requirement is not groping. THe basic requirement is a small light within you.\nGroping is endless and there is more possibility that you will stumble with this wall and that wall, that you will have this fracture and that fracture, that you will fall upon this thing and upon that, and you will be continuously in a frustration and misery will be multiplied. And slowly slowly a desperation sets in.\nThe child trusts very much that he will be able to find; the young man is very enthusiastic, very romantic, a dreamer, and he feels that he will be able to do what nobody else has been ever able to do -- but look at the old man: he knows that it is all groping, he knows all the pains he has suffered, he has knows, known all the pitfalls, he has broken every limb, he has accumulated nothing but frustrations and failures, he has become utterly hopeless.\nIt is not accidental that old people are always angry. It is very difficult to live with old people; they are always irritated, angry. They are not angry with you in particular, they are simply angry at themselves.\nTheir whole life has gone down the drain. You have to forgive their anger.\nThe angry young man is a very latest arrival on the earth, but the angry old man is very ancient. Old people have always been angry, that's why it is so difficult for people to cope with their parents: the gap is big; they are enthusiastic, they are still hopeful, they are dreaming, they want to do this and that, and they feel they will be able to do it, and the old people, the parents know that it is all nonsense. \"It has never happened, it is never going to happen, we have lost our lives and you are going to lose your life,\" but the young man has to go through his experiences, he cannot borrow them from the old, and the old person becomes angry because he is not listened, and he is really saying a truth. He becomes angry because nobody pays any heed to him. He is discarded, ignored. Nobody wants to talk to him, nobody wants to sit at his bedside and listen to him attentively.\nWho wants to listen to a failure, to a desperate person, drowning? Who wants to listen to somebody who will give some taste of his hopelessness to you? -- Who will create some frustration in you, who will destroy your dreams which are so beautiful. So nobody wants to communicate: this is the generation gap. One generation cannot communicate with another generation, and the reason is that older you get, the more aware you become that all groping is futile, that the whole life is a sheer exercise of futility and nothing else.\nThere is a truth in it. The truth is that they have only been groping, they never create a light within themselves.\nWe call the old man wise who has the freshness of the young person and the innocence of the child, who is not feeling hopeless. Even encountering death he is in absolute bliss: he has arrived, he has found the home. And the only way to find the home is to create light. The energy should not be wasted in groping.\nThe whole energy should be concentratedly put into meditation, because meditation is the art of creating light. Once the light is there the path is simple. Sometimes it happens, the door may be just by the corner, maybe just you had to bypass some furniture and the door was there. Maybe you were just standing on the door, but the door needed to be opened. Maybe on the door was written \"pull\" and you were pushing.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMaybe just something simple; just a little light and you can read what is written on the door. If it is written\n\"pull\" and you are pushing, your whole life will be wasted. You can go on pushing and pushing and everybody is pushing hard.\nDon't waste you energy in groping. First settle down wherever you are, accumulate your energy. Don't waste it in any way; become a reservoir of energy. And be silent, silently aware. Just go on settling inside.\nWhen all turmoil has settled, when there is no noise within, in that very moment suddenly a flame bursts forth in you. And this is the greatest miracle there is, when you inner world becomes full of light.\nThe moment your inner world is full of light you can walk in that light anywhere you want. You can find everything that you want; you can find bliss, you can find truth, you can find beauty, you can find love.\nAll possibilities are suddenly open, and it is only a question of creating light.\nSo I don't say philosophise, think, study, grope, search, seek. I simply say sit silently, gather all you energies, become centred, still, and out of that centering and stillness is the beginning of a light and that light then goes on growing. One day you are just pure light and nothing else.\nThat is the day one has found the home, one had found the ultimate bliss which begins but never ends.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Neha.\nDhyan means meditation and Neha means love.\nMeditation is your inner experience, absolutely private. Love is its expression. Meditation is the inner side of the experience; love is its outer side. It is through love that your meditation shines forth, it is through love that your meditation flows and starts reaching to others.\nMeditation is the flower, invisible flower. Love is its fragrance.\nA man without love cannot really be a meditator; hence that is the criterion to judge whether a meditator is really a meditator: his lovingness will prove it. And out of hundred so-called saints, ninety-nine are absolutely unloving, not only unloving but full of hate: hate for the world, hate for the ordinary life, hate for this and hate for that. This is not possible to meditators. A meditator is simply a lover: he loves.\nIt is said of Rabiya el Adawiya, one of the Sufi mystic woman, that when she came across her copy of the Koran a small sentence which says \"Hate the devil,\" she crossed it, she corrected it. As far as Mohammedans are concerned it is sacrilegious, you cannot correct the Koran -- it is god's word!\nA mystic was staying with Rabiya. He saw this happening, he said \"What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Koran cannot be corrected -- it is god's message given by his final prophet, and this is the last message. Now no more message is going to come. You cannot correct it!\"\nRabiya said \"I don't care whose message it is. Something is wrong in it, something is wrong because my experience is something else. It says \"Hate the devil\", but I cannot hate! It is absolutely irrelevant to me. It is my copy. I am not correcting anybody else copy. It is my copy, it has to correspond to my experience.\nSince I have known silence, meditation, I know only love! If devil comes to me I will love in the same way as if god comes to me. There will be no distinction. In fact I will not be able to make a distinction at all, that who is the god and who is the devil. How I am going to distinguish? I will love both in the same way because now I am love.\"\nThis is the ultimate flowering of meditation: you simply become love. Hence I say a man without love is not a meditator. And the so-called saint of all the religions have been doing that: trying to meditate but avoiding love.\nAnd the worldly people are trying to do the opposite: trying to love, avoiding meditation. Now that too is not possible; you cannot love without meditation. They always go together. They are not even like two wheels of a bicycle, because some sunning fellow can use only one wheel.\nI have one sannyasin here (laughter)... he moves only on one-wheel bicycle; it is not a BIcycle, it is a monocycle. It is not even like two wheels of a bullock cart. It is like two sides of a coin: you cannot avoid the other side. You can hide it but you cannot avoid it; it is bound to be there. Either you have to have both or you have to throw the whole coin.\nSo anybody who chooses love or meditation is throwing both. It is not a question of either-or. You cannot choose. They come inseparably -- and that's what my sannyasins have to prove, that's how my sannyasins have to live. It has never been done. It is time that it should be done, and should be done on a very large scale so the whole world becomes aware that meditation and love are complementary to each other, that there is no need to renounce the world. In fact a real sannyasin will rejoice in the world. He will love and his love will strength\nhis meditation, and he will meditate and his meditation will nourish his love. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove and meditation are like two wings of a bird. This is your name: Swami Prasad Devama.\nPrasad means a gift. Devama means divine.\nLife is a divine gift, but we are very unthankful people. Love is a divine gift, but we have not thanked the whole for it. All that we have got is a gift. We have not earned it; we don't even deserve it, we are not worthy of it. It is given to us by the whole just because the whole is overflowing. It is out of the abundance of god that we get all that we are.\nA sannyasin has to become aware of all of this. The moment you start becoming aware all complaints disappear, all grumbling disappear. Instead of complaints a prayer arises in the heart. To me the prayer that is being done in the churches and the temples and the mosques is not true prayer, because people are asking and asking, desiring, demanding. Their prayers are nothing but applications for more. Deep down there is that complaining mind which is saying \"I have not got enough yet, others are having more. Be just, be fair to me. This is not justice.\" It is not said so, but actually it comes to it: \"Give me more!\" This is not prayer --\nbegging maybe, but not prayer.\nPrayer has a totally different flavour. It is thankfulness for all that has already been given to us. It is not a demand. And the miracle is the more you demand the less you will get, because you become a pain in the neck of god! (laughter) What you are doing in prayer is just nagging! God is being tortured by these religious people.\nFriedrich Nietzsche says god is dead and then he says \"Do you know how he\ndied? We have killed him!\"\nGod is dead -- that seems to be right -- but we have not killed him, that is not right: he has committed suicide! (laughter) Because of all these naggers -- and there are millions and this is only one earth. Scientists say there are at least fifty thousand planets which have life there. So just think of a poor god, one god, only one begotten son. (laughter)... a very small family, planned family. Whatsoever was discardable they have discarded: no mother, no wife -- just god and the begotten son, and the holy ghost! (laughter) Maybe just needed for doing small things for both, running here and there, doing errands (laughter), or cooking food or washing clothes!\nAnd ghosts are good for such things: they need constant occupation. They ask again and again \"Give us work.\" They are workoholics! (laughter) Just the smallest family possible, the most essential family... They must have become tired listening to all these prayers. If god is dead he must have committed suicide. There is no other explanation: if he is dead, then that is the only explanation.\nMy understanding of prayer is it has to be just a gratefulness. In fact there is no need to say anything; just a heart full of gratefulness is enough! Bowing down to the earth or to the trees or to the stars is enough!\nExistence understands only one language, the language of silence. It knows no other languages, neither Greek nor Latin, nor Hebrew nor Sanskrit nor Chinese -\n- it knows no other languages, not even English!

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Dhyan means meditation . Runa means mysterious.</p><p>Life can be approached either through the mind or through a state of
no-mind. These are the only two alternative approaches.</p><p>Science approaches life through the mind, religion through the
no-mind; hence science comes only to know the superficial, the factual,
the mathematical, the measurable. Its very approach prohibits it to
enter into the mysterious. Its very presupposition is against the
mysterious.</p><p>Science has been endeavouring to demystify existence. That's its aim.
It is not</p><p>said so obviously but if you look into scientific researches,
discoveries, it is not difficult to find the essential core. Science is
trying to find answers for every question possible. It divides existence
into two categories: the known and the unknown. That which is known
today was unkown yesterday. That which is unknown today will become
known tomorrow. That's the only difference between the two. There is no
basic difference, no qualitative difference; only a difference of
quantity.</p><p>A little more effort, a little more work, a little more research and
a day is not far away when all will become known. The unknown is being
reduced slowly into the known, the unknown is becoming less and less and
the known is becoming bigger and bigger. Soon the whole territory will
be known. That's the goal of science. In other words that's what I call
demystification.</p><p>But we are moving towards a very dangerous state. If it is all
becomes possible, that all is known, life will become absolutely futile.
Life's meaning is in its mystery, but science prohibits it. Its very
methodology debars it, makes it blind for the mysterious. The mysterious
is a third category; it does not come under the category of the known
nor under the category of the unknown; it belongs to the totally
different category: the unknowable -- and that is the dimension of
religion, the unknowable.</p><p>It cannot be known but it can be experienced. It cannot be known but
it can be lived. You cannot reduce it into an answer, into a system of
thought, into a logical proposition, into a philosophy. It is vast, it
is infinite, it is eternal, but you can drink of it, you can become
utterly drunk with it, you can dance it, you can sing it. You can love
it, but knowing is not possible.</p><p>And to move towards the unknowable you have to make a great change
within yourself: you have to move you energy from the mind to a state of
no-mind. That's what I call meditation. Meditation simply means putting
the mind aside, looking into reality without any idea what it is,
without any presupposition</p><p>,without any a priori knowledge, looking into existence innocently
like a small child. That very look becomes a transformation. That seeing
with innocent heart, with wonder in your eyes, with a deep overwhelming
awe, and you are falling in tune with the mysterious, you are moving
beyond the known and the unknown, towards the unknowable.</p><p>God is another name for the unknowable; so is truth, so is love, so
is beauty. Different names but indicating to the same moon. Different
fingers pointing to the same moon.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Veet Cecile.</p><p>Veet means transcendence, surpassing, going beyond. Cecile means
blind.</p><p>Everybody is born blind, but with the capacity to go beyond it, with
the potential to transcend it. Very few people have transcended the
blindness, for the simple reason because they take it for granted that
this is what life is all about. They misunderstand birth with life.
Birth is not life, neither birth is the beginning of life nor the death
its end. Life is not something between birth and death; on the contrary,
birth and death are just small episodes in the long journey of life.
Many times birth has happened, many times death has happened: life
continues unhindered, undistracted.</p><p>So those who take birth as if this is life will remain blind, and
then they are bound to be continuously afraid and trembling about death,
because if birth is life, then death is the end. One fallacy leads to
another fallacy, and between these two fallacies -- birth and death --
the whole opportunity is lost. Between birth and death there is only an
opportunity to realise your potential. But it is not given.</p><p>The seed is there but the seed is not the flower. The seed contains
the flower. If you cut the seed you will not find the flower; you have
to find right soil, right climate, right time, so that the seed can die
and disappear into the soil and can become a plant.</p><p>Once the seed has started growing, the seed has lost its blindness.
The seed is blind. It is completely closed from everywhere. It lives in
a kind of grave, encapsulated, but the tree is not encapsulated. It has
come out of the grave. It is alive, it is open -- open to the sun, open
to the moon, open to the stars. It is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

vulnerable. It sways and dances and rejoices.</p><p>It has moods of sadness, of joy. Yes, there are moments of mourning
and moments of festivity.</p><p>Now these are scientific facts, even science has become aware about
the living element in the trees which is <em>very</em> sensitive,
ultimately of the same category as man; a different expression of
consciousness, a different form of sensitivity, different kind of eyes,
different kind of ears, but the tree hears, the tree sees, the tree
feels. When you touch it with love it recognises your warmth, it
responds. When you come with an axe to cut it, it shivers, trembles, it
knows the enemy and the friend, it knows the lover, it knows just the
bypasser. It has its own eyes.</p><p>Every man is born as a seed and every man has the capacity to become
a rosebush with hundreds of roses available to existence, in communion
with existence. That's what I call <em>the</em> eyes. When you are
blossoming then you have many eyes, because existence is
multidimensional.</p><p>These two eyes that we have are nothing. That is only one small
dimension, the physiological, but there are many dimensions, many
planes, many aspects of reality. And if a man works upon one's own
energies, he starts growing many kinds of eyes. He starts becoming
perceptive in thousand and one ways.</p><p>When you have reached to the optimum of your potential, when you have
realised all that was unrealised in you, then we call, one is
enlightened, awakened, is a Christ or is a Buddha.</p><p>Your name is significant; it is the situation -- everybody is born
blind, but there is no need to stop there.</p><p>In fact it should become a challenge to go beyond it. If a person can
know that "I am blind," then he is bound to do something about it. The
moment one knows "I am ignorant," he has already taken a very
significant step towards knowing, because nobody wants to be ignorant,
nobody wants to be blind, nobody wants to be unconscious, mechanical,
robotlike. That is not our nature, that is not our fulfilment. Everybody
wants to grow in consciousness, awareness; only then slowly slowly bliss
arises, love arises, freedom arises.</p><p>These are all the flowers, these are all different eyes.</p><p>And when you are able to see all that is possible to be seen, then
only there is contentment, immense contentment, and great gratitude for
existence. To me that gratitude is prayer, and that contentment is the
goal of all religion.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Purnam Seth.</p><p>Purnam means the perfect, the ultimate, the absolute, the whole. Seth
means the appointed.</p><p>We are all appointed by the whole; and life should not be thought as
an accident. That's what science goes on telling to every child. It is
unfortunate that the children from their very small age are being
conditioned with a very wrong attitude which is going to darken their
whole life. And from the Kg to the university this is the climate, that
life is accidental, that there is no meaning in existence, that we are
just by-products of accidental situations, that we are not needed
really. If we disappear nothing is lost; if we are nothing is added.</p><p>The whole existence according to the scientific attitude is
accidental. There is no intrinsic significance.</p><p>It is a chaos according to science, not a cosmos. Cosmos needs some
meaning, some intrinsic truth. It is only through religious experience
that this chaos is transformed into a cosmos.</p><p>Religion gives meaning, significance, a sense of being needed. And
remember: it is one of the greatest needs in life, to be needed. And if
one can feel that "The whole existence needs me," that "I am here not by
accident," that "I am appointed to be here," that "I have a certain
message to deliver," that "I have to fulfil a certain mission," that "My
life has to deliver, contribute, something beautiful to existence, only
then I will feel fulfilled, only then I will feel I have done my work"
-- and the joy that comes when you have done any work to perfection; any
work in which you have put your total heart.</p><p>When you have done it well, finished it well, a great ecstasy arises.
It is my observation that only creative people know what ecstasy is. And
by creativity I mean fulfilling something hidden in you, discovering it
and fulfilling it in your life. Then you have contributed, you have
added some beauty to the existence, some joy.</p><p>Existence is a little more enriched by you that it was before you.
You will be</p><p>leaving existence a little better, a little higher, a little more
poetic, a little more magical, a little more golden than you have found
it when you had arrived. That is fulfillment, that's ecstasy.</p><p>The experience comes as you become silent. The more silent you
become, the more you start feeling the hands of the ultimate behind you.
When you are totally silent you suddenly some to see that you are just a
bamboo flute on the lips of the ultimate: the song is flowing through
you. Your only work is not to hinder it, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

is, it should be delivered.</p><p>Sannyas means living a life of pure silence, living life through
silence, and then this is the first experience that comes to oneself,
that "I am part of a great cosmic plan," that "I belong to an organic
universe," that "I am not just a cog in a wheel, that any other cog can
replace me." In fact nobody is replaceable, everybody is unique. The
moment it is felt, life comes to its ultimate peak of rejoicing.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Henry. Anand means bliss. Henry means
home.</p><p>The deepest desire in every heart is to find bliss; a bliss that is
eternal, a bliss that comes but never goes, a bliss that is forever. But
we all are groping, not knowing where to go, there to find it, not
knowing what direction is the right direction, what path to follow. But
in darkness, in blindness, still, we all are groping.</p><p>The drunkard is groping, the gambler is groping, the priest is
groping, the philosopher is groping, the saint is groping -- they are
all groping -- in different ways, in different corners.</p><p>My only teaching here is that before you start groping create some
awareness. Don't waste your time in groping. First requirement is to be
alert, aware, watchful, because awareness is a kind of light inside.
Once you have the light, even if it is a small candle, you can find the
way. You can find the door out of the mess you are, out of the misery
you are, you can find the door to the temple of bliss. But the basic
requirement is not groping. THe basic requirement is a small light
within you.</p><p>Groping is endless and there is more possibility that you will
stumble with this wall and that wall, that you will have this fracture
and that fracture, that you will fall upon this thing and upon that, and
you will be continuously in a frustration and misery will be multiplied.
And slowly slowly a desperation sets in.</p><p>The child trusts very much that he will be able to find; the young
man is very enthusiastic, very romantic, a dreamer, and he feels that he
will be able to do what nobody else has been ever able to do -- but look
at the old man: he knows that it is all groping, he knows all the pains
he has suffered, he has knows, known all the pitfalls, he has broken
every limb, he has accumulated nothing but frustrations and failures, he
has become utterly hopeless.</p><p>It is not accidental that old people are always angry. It is very
difficult to live with old people; they are always irritated, angry.
They are not angry with you in particular, they are simply angry at
themselves.</p><p>Their whole life has gone down the drain. You have to forgive their
anger.</p><p>The angry young man is a very latest arrival on the earth, but the
angry old man is very ancient. Old people have always been angry, that's
why it is so difficult for people to cope with their parents: the gap is
big; they are enthusiastic, they are still hopeful, they are dreaming,
they want to do this and that, and they feel they will be able to do it,
and the old people, the parents know that it is all nonsense. "It has
never happened, it is never going to happen, we have lost our lives and
<em>you</em> are going to lose your life," but the young man has to go
through his experiences, he cannot borrow them from the old, and the old
person becomes angry because he is not listened, and he is
<em>really</em> saying a truth. He becomes angry because nobody pays any
heed to him. He is discarded, ignored. Nobody wants to talk to him,
nobody wants to sit at his bedside and listen to him attentively.</p><p>Who wants to listen to a failure, to a desperate person, drowning?
Who wants to listen to somebody who will give some taste of his
hopelessness to you? -- Who will create some frustration in you, who
will destroy your dreams which are so beautiful. So nobody wants to
communicate: this is the generation gap. One generation cannot
communicate with another generation, and the reason is that older you
get, the more aware you become that all groping is futile, that the
whole life is a sheer exercise of futility and nothing else.</p><p>There is a truth in it. The truth is that they have only been
groping, they never create a light within themselves.</p><p>We call the old man wise who has the freshness of the young person
and the innocence of the child, who is not feeling hopeless. Even
encountering death he is in absolute bliss: he has arrived, he has found
the home. And the only way to find the home is to create light. The
energy should not be wasted in groping.</p><p>The whole energy should be concentratedly put into meditation,
because meditation is the art of creating light. Once the light is there
the path is simple. Sometimes it happens, the door may be just by the
corner, maybe just you had to bypass some furniture and the door was
there. Maybe you were just standing on the door, but the door needed to
be opened. Maybe on the door was written "pull" and you were
pushing.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Maybe just something simple; just a little light and you can read
what is written on the door. If it is written</p><p>"pull" and you are pushing, your whole life will be wasted. You can
go on pushing and pushing and everybody is pushing hard.</p><p>Don't waste you energy in groping. First settle down wherever you
are, accumulate your energy. Don't waste it in any way; become a
reservoir of energy. And be silent, silently aware. Just go on settling
inside.</p><p>When all turmoil has settled, when there is no noise within, in that
very moment suddenly a flame bursts forth in you. And this is the
greatest miracle there is, when you inner world becomes full of
light.</p><p>The moment your inner world is full of light you can walk in that
light anywhere you want. You can find everything that you want; you can
find bliss, you can find truth, you can find beauty, you can find
love.</p><p>All possibilities are suddenly open, and it is only a question of
creating light.</p><p>So I don't say philosophise, think, study, grope, search, seek. I
simply say sit silently, gather all you energies, become centred, still,
and out of that centering and stillness is the beginning of a light and
that light then goes on growing. One day you are just pure light and
nothing else.</p><p>That is the day one has found the home, one had found the ultimate
bliss which begins but never ends.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Neha.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation and Neha means love.</p><p>Meditation is your inner experience, absolutely private. Love is its
expression. Meditation is the inner side of the experience; love is its
outer side. It is through love that your meditation shines forth, it is
through love that your meditation flows and starts reaching to
others.</p><p>Meditation is the flower, invisible flower. Love is its
fragrance.</p><p>A man without love cannot really be a meditator; hence that is the
criterion to judge whether a meditator is really a meditator: his
lovingness will prove it. And out of hundred so-called saints,
ninety-nine are absolutely unloving, not only unloving but full of hate:
hate for the world, hate for the ordinary life, hate for this and hate
for that. This is not possible to meditators. A meditator is simply a
lover: he loves.</p><p>It is said of Rabiya el Adawiya, one of the Sufi mystic woman, that
when she came across her copy of the Koran a small sentence which says
"Hate the devil," she crossed it, she corrected it. As far as
Mohammedans are concerned it is sacrilegious, you cannot correct the
Koran -- it is god's word!</p><p>A mystic was staying with Rabiya. He saw this happening, he said
"What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Koran cannot be corrected -- it
is god's message given by his <em>final</em> prophet, and this is the
last message. Now no more message is going to come. You cannot correct
it!"</p><p>Rabiya said "I don't care whose message it is. Something is wrong in
it, something is wrong because my experience is something else. It says
"Hate the devil", but I cannot hate! It is absolutely irrelevant to me.
It is <em>my</em> copy. I am not correcting anybody else copy. It is
<em>my</em> copy, it has to correspond to <em>my</em> experience.</p><p>Since I have known silence, meditation, I know only love! If devil
comes to me I will love in the same way as if god comes to me. There
will be no distinction. In fact I will not be able to make a distinction
at all, that who is the god and who is the devil. How I am going to
distinguish? I will love both in the same way because now I am
love."</p><p>This is the ultimate flowering of meditation: you simply become love.
Hence I say a man without love is not a meditator. And the so-called
saint of all the religions have been doing that: trying to meditate but
avoiding love.</p><p>And the worldly people are trying to do the opposite: trying to love,
avoiding meditation. Now that too is not possible; you cannot love
without meditation. They always go together. They are not even like two
wheels of a bicycle, because some sunning fellow can use only one
wheel.</p><p>I have one sannyasin here (laughter)... he moves only on one-wheel
bicycle; it is not a BIcycle, it is a monocycle. It is not even like two
wheels of a bullock cart. It is like two sides of a coin: you cannot
avoid the other side. You can hide it but you cannot avoid it; it is
bound to be there. Either you have to have both or you have to throw the
whole coin.</p><p>So anybody who chooses love <em>or</em> meditation is throwing both.
It is not a question of either-or. You cannot choose. They come
inseparably -- and that's what my sannyasins have to prove, that's how
my sannyasins have to live. It has never been done. It is time that it
should be done, and should be done on a very large scale so the whole
world becomes aware that meditation and love are complementary to each
other, that there is no need to renounce the world. In fact a real
sannyasin will rejoice in the world. He will love and his love will
strength</p><p>his meditation, and he will meditate and his meditation will nourish
his love. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

Swami Prasad Devama.</p><p>Prasad means a gift. Devama means divine.</p><p>Life is a divine gift, but we are very unthankful people. Love is a
divine gift, but we have not thanked the whole for it. All that we have
got is a gift. We have not earned it; we don't even deserve it, we are
not worthy of it. It is given to us by the whole just because the whole
is overflowing. It is out of the abundance of god that we get all that
we are.</p><p>A sannyasin has to become aware of all of this. The moment you start
becoming aware all complaints disappear, all grumbling disappear.
Instead of complaints a prayer arises in the heart. To me the prayer
that is being done in the churches and the temples and the mosques is
not true prayer, because people are asking and asking, desiring,
demanding. Their prayers are nothing but applications for more. Deep
down there is that complaining mind which is saying "I have not got
enough yet, others are having more. Be just, be fair to me. This is not
justice." It is not said so, but actually it comes to it: "Give me
more!" This is not prayer --</p><p>begging maybe, but not prayer.</p><p>Prayer has a totally different flavour. It is thankfulness for all
that has already been given to us. It is not a demand. And the miracle
is the more you demand the less you will get, because you become a pain
in the neck of god! (laughter) What you are doing in prayer is just
nagging! God is being tortured by these religious people.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche says god is dead and then he says "Do you know
how he</p><p>died? <em>We</em> have killed him!"</p><p>God is dead -- that seems to be right -- but we have not killed him,
that is not right: he has committed suicide! (laughter) Because of all
these naggers -- and there are millions and this is only one earth.
Scientists say there are at least fifty thousand planets which have life
there. So just think of a poor god, one god, only one begotten son.
(laughter)... a very small family, planned family. Whatsoever was
discardable they have discarded: no mother, no wife -- just god and the
begotten son, and the holy ghost! (laughter) Maybe just needed for doing
small things for both, running here and there, doing errands (laughter),
or cooking food or washing clothes!</p><p>And ghosts are good for such things: they need constant occupation.
They ask again and again "Give us work." They are workoholics!
(laughter) Just the smallest family possible, the most essential
family... They must have become tired listening to all these prayers. If
god is dead he must have committed suicide. There is no other
explanation: if he is dead, then that is the only explanation.</p><p>My <span class=p>understanding of prayer is it has to be just a
gratefulness. In fact there is no need to say anything; just a heart
full of gratefulness is enough! Bowing down to the earth or to the trees
or to the stars is enough!</span></p><p>Existence understands only one language, the language of silence. It
knows no other languages, neither Greek nor Latin, nor Hebrew nor
Sanskrit nor Chinese -</p><p>- it knows no other languages, not even English! It knows no
languages at all.</p><p>The only possibility is to commune in silence, and a grateful heart
is enough. But that gratefulness i possible only if you start seeing all

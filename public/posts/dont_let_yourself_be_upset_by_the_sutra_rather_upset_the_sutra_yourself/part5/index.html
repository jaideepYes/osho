Anand Gitta. Anand means bliss; gitta comes from a root which means bridge.
Bliss is the bridge. Nobody ever has entered into God without being blissful. The doors are closed for miserable people. Those who cling to misery will remain without God, because misery disconnects you from existence, it isolates you.

Anand means bliss; gitta comes from a root which means bridge.\nBliss is the bridge. Nobody ever has entered into God without being blissful. The doors are closed for miserable people. Those who cling to misery will remain without God, because misery disconnects you from existence, it isolates you. Misery makes you an ego. The moment you are blissful the ego starts melting. When you are really blissful there is no ego to be found at all, and that’s how one becomes reconnected, bridged.\nThe ego is the barrier; bliss is the bridge. And they never exist together, they cannot: either you are blissful or you are an egoist. The egoist is bound to be miserable; misery follows the ego as a shadow. And the blissful person is followed by God.\nOne of the great Indian mystics, Kabir, has said: “There were days when I was searching and exploring and enquiring, and I was almost mad in my search and I was calling ‘God, God, where are you?’ And I was constantly crying and weeping, day in, day out, and there was no response – the skies remained silent. Then one day it happened: I was not crying, I was blissful, as blissful as a bird on the wing, as blissful as an opening lotus in the lake, as blissful as the rising sun, and suddenly God started calling me: ‘Kabir, Kabir, where are you?“’\nAnd Kabir says, “Since I know the secret I don’t bother at all about God; I remain blissful and he goes on following me, calling ‘Kabir, Kabir, where are you going? What are you doing?“’\nAnand Alfred. Anand means bliss; alfred means wise.\nIt is bliss that makes one wise – not knowledge, not information, but a dancing heart... not a memory crammed with information, but a heart that knows how to be cheerful, how to be singing. When your\nheart becomes a singing bird, then wisdom arrives. Wisdom arrives only when you are innocent, and bliss creates the space for innocence to happen. They go together, bliss and innocence; hence children look so blissful: they are so innocent. Knowledge has not yet corrupted them; they are not yet poisoned by the society.\nThe work of a Master consists in undoing what society has done to you. He has to make a clean sheet out of you again, he has to give you a new birth, a new childhood. That’s what sannyas is all about: initiation into a second childhood. And remember these two things, which are not really two but two aspects of one phenomenon: be blissful and you will be wise. Whatsoever is done out of bliss is always wise; whatsoever is done out of misery, anger, sadness, jealousy, hatred, is bound to be wrong.\nIn my vision, bliss is virtue. To be blissful is to be a saint, and to be miserable is to be a sinner.\n[The new sannyasin asked about a noise in his ears which is especially loud when there is silence. The noise changes.]\nIt changes... Do one thing: start listening to it very attentively. When it happens, don’t be worried about it. Rather, focus on it: let it be the object of meditation. Listen to it minutely, in detail, so nothing is missed, as if it is tremendously important and not a single note should be missed. Be very meditative about it, and you will be surprised: the noise will lose all its disturbance; it will become a melody, it will be come very musical. And it is something beautiful, nothing to be worried about. It has not to be stopped, it has to be transformed. This is the way to transform it.\nAnd I have given you one group, Vipassana, first to tenth September – that will help you to concentrate on it. In those ten days the thing will happen. So after that you remind me again. But nothing to be worried about; it is not a disease... and it can be a blessing. Just wait!\nBut you start. Whenever you feel it, whenever you find silence around you and it is there, sit silently, close your eyes and focus on it – as if the whole world had disappeared and only that noise is your world, as if that noise is the voice of God – and you will be able to transform it!\nAnand Gerrit. Anand means bliss; gerrit means brave, courageous.\nThe coward is bound to live in misery because the coward cannot go beyond his past; he clings to the past because the past feels familiar, safer, secure. But to live in the past is not to live at all, to live in the past is a kind of death. And out of that slow death arises misery. One’s whole life starts stinking of death. Life is always in the present, but for that one needs great courage: courage to detach oneself from the past, courage not to look back, courage to leave the familiar, courage to live in insecurity. In fact that is the definition of sannyas: the courage to live in insecurity, to live moment to moment, not knowing what is going to happen next... without any clinging to the past and without any projections for the future. When one lives in the present, life has a thrill, it becomes an adventure. Then it has ecstasy, and that ecstasy is anand, that ecstasy is bliss.\nCourage brings bliss. And because millions of people are cowards, the world remains in misery. It is very rarely that a courageous person steps out of the crowd, finds his own way, lives his own life, risks everything, becomes an individual, rebels against the crowd-mind, the mob-mind, and declares\nhis independence. In that freedom is bliss, and in that freedom is God. That freedom is bliss, that freedom is God.\nAnand Annelise. Anand means bliss; Anne means prayer; lise means God – a blissful prayer for God. That has to become your very existence: a blissful prayer to God.\nPrayer is blissful when it is an expression of gratitude, with no demands, with no complaints. Whenever one starts asking for something in prayer, it is no longer blissful; it is praying out of misery, out of demand, out of need. It loses its grandeur, its grace. It is nothing but desire disguised as prayer. And that’s what goes on in the churches, temples, mosques, in the name of prayer: people are not praying, people are asking, demanding, people are trying to exploit even God for their own purposes. They pray only when they are in need, they remember God when they are in misery. They completely forget God when they are happy. And the real prayer arises out of happiness, not Out of misery, so it is very rarely that real prayer happens in the world, because people pray when they are in pain and they forget completely when they are in pleasure. When everything is going well who bothers about God and who bothers about prayer? When something is not going right, you start remembering God.\nIt happened in the life of one of the very rare men of this century, Fyodor Dostoevsky, the Russian novelist. He was also a revolutionary, and he was condemned to death with eleven of his other comrades. All twelve were to be shot early in the morning at exactly six o’clock. They were made to stand in a line and they started looking at the church tower, at the clock, and minute by minute life was disappearing. And Dostoevsky says in his memoirs that in those four, five moments, he remembered his whole past.\nIt happens: when death approaches and you become aware that death is coming – when it takes you unawares – then it doesn’t happen; but when you know that at exactly six o’clock you will be shot dead and only five minutes are left, one starts having a review. The whole film of the past starts moving. And in those five minutes he remembered that he has not lived his life attentively. He had wasted his life, he had lived as a robot, as a machine, unconsciously, almost asleep. He could not remember a single moment of attentiveness, of awareness. He decided, “If another life is given to me, I will devote my whole life to awareness.” And by chance it happened that he was forgiven; exactly one minute before, the order from the Czar came that all those twelve had to be forgiven.\nThen somebody asked him after a few years: “What happened to your decision?” He said, “I tried, but it didn’t work out; I could not live attentively. I still try but... for a moment it is there and then it is gone.”\nPeople are living almost in a kind of sleep. But when pain comes, misery comes, they are disturbed in their sleep and they start praying, and they take great decisions that “Now, from now onwards, I will be good, I will be this, I will be that.” But that is not true prayer. If it comes out of pain, once the pain is gone the prayer will be gone. The true prayer has to arise out of bliss, it has to arise out of your gratitude to God, it has to arise out of a tremendous sense that you are part of this great, profound mystery, that such an infinitely beautiful universe has been given to you for no reason at all; you have not earned it. It is a sheer gift from God. Then there is prayer.\nAnd if prayer is there, God is there. Wherever prayer is, God is. People ask, “Where is God?” – their question is meaningless. They should ask, “What is prayer?” – because wherever prayer is, God is.\nPrayer is the way to see God. Prayer gives you the eyes, the perspective to see God. So Anand Annelise will mean: a blissful prayer to God. Let that become your existence too.\nPrem means love; janine means gift of God. Love can only be a gift from God. Man can create only commodities. Commodities have no values, they have prices but no values, and values have no price. Values are beyond price. And love is the greatest of all the values, the suprememost value; everything else can be sacrificed for it, but it cannot be sacrificed for anything else.\nJust to become aware that it comes from the beyond – that it descends and we just have to be empty to receive it, a womb that we have to be pregnant with it – that awareness and a door that has remained closed up to now starts opening. You become capable of seeing things which you had never suspected before. And then it pours, it simply pours. So much comes that you cannot contain it, you have to share it with others.\nAnd my sannyasin has to become a vehicle for love, a passage, just a pure passage with no hindrance... not standing in between. Just an emptiness, utterly empty, so that if God wants to flow through you, he can flow without any resistance from your side. To be in that non-resistant state is to be in meditation, and to allow God and his love to flow through you is to be a saint.\nA saint is one who has disappeared, who has become absent, whose presence is no more there, in whose presence God has become present himself, he has annihilated himself totally. That is the ultimate goal for a sannyasin. It can be achieved, it has to be achieved, because without it life remains unfulfilled, life remains nightmarish. With it, life becomes paradise.\nAnand Yusuf. Anand means blissful; I don’t know myself the meaning of yusuf, but that doesn’t matter. Whatsoever it means, be blissful! But suf means pure. From suf comes sufi... the purest of the heart. Yusuf may have something to do with it. And there is a tomb in Kashmir which is believed to be the tomb of Jesus, but the stone on it says “the tomb of Isa Yusuf”. It seems yusuf is a form of Jesus, the Arabic form of Jesus – the possibility is there, it is only a possibility.\nThen it becomes very significant. The word “jesus” means one who is beloved of God. And Jesus is one of the greatest Sufis of the world. The word “suf” also means clean, absolutely clean, with no dirt, a mirror without any dirt, so that it can reflect God. But I am not certain whether these meanings are really applicable to yusuf or not, hence I say: be blissful! My message is bliss, and bliss brings cleanliness, bliss brings clarity, bliss brings the kind of heart that becomes beloved of God. It creates Jesus in you.\nBut the whole alchemy depends on the process of being blissful, then all else follows. People have a very deep misunderstanding of bliss; they think it is a goal. It is not a goal, it is a discipline. If you think of bliss as a goal, then how can you be blissful right now? First you have to prepare yourself, you have to go through many austerities, fasts, prayers, rituals, then one day maybe sometime in the future – maybe in this life or in other lives – you will be capable of being blissful. To think of bliss as a goal helps you to postpone it. That’s not my idea of bliss. Bliss is not a goal but a discipline in itself. You can be blissful this very moment, it is only a decision on your part.\nIt is our choice to be miserable or to be blissful. If we choose to be blissful no power can make us miserable, and I say it through my own experience, and through the experience of thousands of my\nsannyasins that it is only a question of decisiveness. If you decide to be blissful nobody can make you miserable. Even if you are thrown into hell you will remain blissful. You will enjoy hell too; it will be really a fantastic trip and you will meet beautiful people there!\nHell and heaven are not something outside you; they exist in your eyes. The man who knows how to be miserable will be miserable even if he is with God; he will find ways and means of being miserable. Even in paradise he will count the thorns on the rosebushes, and the man who knows how to be blissful, even in hell, will count the roses.\nSo let it become a fundamental rule of your life, that at each moment you have to decide. The alternatives are always open, both alternatives, we are always on the crossroads. You can move in the direction of misery, you can move in the direction of bliss; always choose the direction of bliss. Slowly slowly, it becomes natural to you, then there is no need to choose it deliberately; you simply choose it. And to be blissful is to be ready for God. God is the goal, not bliss; bliss is the discipline to attain God.\nAnand Nirmohi. Anand means bliss, blissfulness; nirmohi means non-attached.\nBlissfulness is possible only if one remains non-attached to everything that happens, remains unclinging to everything that happens, does not become identified with anything. The mind immediately starts clinging, and particularly when something beautiful is happening, the mind naturally tends to cling more. But to cling is to miss it, to cling is to destroy it. If you love and your love becomes possessive, you have killed it. Now you can go on carrying a dead bird – you can put it in a beautiful golden cage – but it cannot sing any more and it cannot fly in the sky and it Cannot soar high in the winds, it cannot whisper with the clouds. All life is gone.\nNirmohi means not to be attached to anything, not to be possessive, not to be clinging... moving through life utterly detached. It does not mean indifference, it does not mean renunciation. Live in life, but don’t gather the dust of experience around yourself. Each moment die to the past so that you are again new, so that each moment you are born again, fresh, again with the wonder of life, again with the surprise of a child, again full of joy, intrigued with everything that is happening.\nThat’s the true way to be a sannyasin: being blissful and yet unattached. In the East we have a metaphor for it. We say that a sannyasin should be like a lotus leaf in the pond: the lotus leaf remains in the water, but it is so silky that the water cannot touch it. It remains in the water but utterly untouched by the water. So even when dewdrops collect on the lotus leaf... In the morning you can see them, separate. They are resting on the lotus leaf, but utterly separate like pearls; a wind will come and they will slip back into the lake and they will not leave a trace behind.\nThat is the way of a sannyasin: to live like a lotus leaf in the pond. Live in the world but remain absolutely unattached, non-possessive, non-clinging. Live as freedom, then God is yours, then truth is yours, then you are yours!\nAnand Sanatano. Anand means bliss; sanatano means eternal.\nHappiness is momentary, hence happiness is bound to be followed by unhappiness. They are like day and night: one is followed by the other inevitably. Hence even when you are happy, you cannot\nbe really happy, because deep down you know unhappiness is on the way. Bliss means something which is timeless, a happiness which is not followed by unhappiness. It comes and remains forever. It only happens once, then it is forever, that’s why it is called eternal: it has a beginning but no end. And that is the goal of life; sannyas is only a methodology to attain it.\nWhen one is finished with happiness, unhappiness, and the duality of it, when one has had enough of it, then the journey for bliss starts, then one starts seeking and searching for something eternal, something deathless. That’s what has created sannyas in the East. The East is far more ancient than the West. The West is still young, hence still interested in the happiness-unhappiness game. The East is too ancient for that, it has known all those games and the futility of it. Sannyas is the greatest contribution of eastern consciousness to humanity. But it has died in its old form. I am trying to revive it. Of course, it will have a new form now – a new body and a new spirit.\nThe old sannyas was more of renunciation. My new sannyas is more of rejoicing. Rejoice in life, rejoice in ordinary things, rejoice in everything possible, rejoice even when moments are almost too difficult to rejoice in... when sadness seems to be natural, when depression seems to be just the right thing, when defeat and defeatism surround you, when you are a failure, frustrated... But remember always that when the night is very dark, the dawn is very close by.\nSo learn to rejoice even in the darkness of the night, because it proclaims the dawn. [A sannyasin asks: How can I have more trust?]\nThat is really a difficult problem... Trust is not a commodity; you cannot have more or less. It is not a quantity. Either you have it or you don’t have it. More or less is not the question at all, it is utterly irrelevant. You cannot have less, you cannot have more. If you have it, you have it, don’t be worried. If you don’t have it, don’t be worried... What is there to be worried about?\nThis is trust! If you have it, good; if you don’t have it, good.\nHelp my people there! And you have it! – don’t be worried. I certify that you have it!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3373","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_let_yourself_be_upset_by_the_sutra_rather_upset_the_sutra_yourself/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_let_yourself_be_upset_by_the_sutra_rather_upset_the_sutra_yourself/>Don\'t Let Yourself Be Upset by the Sutra, rather Upset the Sutra Yourself</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3373 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Let_Yourself_Be_Upset_by_the_Sutra_rather_Upset_the_Sutra_Yourself/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

blissful: they are so innocent. Knowledge has not yet corrupted them;
they are not yet poisoned by the society.</p><p><br></p><p>The work of a Master consists in undoing what society has done to
you. He has to make a clean sheet out of you again, he has to give you a
new birth, a new childhood. That’s what sannyas is all about: initiation
into a second childhood. And remember these two things, which are not
really two but two aspects of one phenomenon: be blissful and you will
be wise. Whatsoever is done out of bliss is always wise; whatsoever is
done out of misery, anger, sadness, jealousy, hatred, is bound to be
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>In my vision, bliss is virtue. To be blissful is to be a saint, and
to be miserable is to be a sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin asked about a noise in his ears which is
especially loud when there is silence. The noise changes.]</p><p><br></p><p>It changes... Do one thing: start listening to it very attentively.
When it happens, don’t be worried about it. Rather, focus on it: let it
be the object of meditation. Listen to it minutely, in detail, so
nothing is missed, as if it is tremendously important and not a single
note should be missed. Be very meditative about it, and you will be
surprised: the noise will lose all its disturbance; it will become a
melody, it will be come very musical. And it is something beautiful,
nothing to be worried about. It has not to be stopped, it has to be
transformed. This is the way to transform it.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have given you one group, Vipassana, first to tenth September –
that will help you to concentrate on it. In those ten days the thing
will happen. So after that you remind me again. But nothing to be
worried about; it is not a disease... and it can be a blessing. Just
wait!</p><p><br></p><p>But you start. Whenever you feel it, whenever you find silence around
you and it is there, sit silently, close your eyes and focus on it – as
if the whole world had disappeared and only that noise is your world, as
if that noise is the voice of God – and you will be able to transform
it!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Gerrit. Anand means bliss; gerrit means brave, courageous.</p><p><br></p><p>The coward is bound to live in misery because the coward cannot go
beyond his past; he clings to the past because the past feels familiar,
safer, secure. But to live in the past is not to live at all, to live in
the past is a kind of death. And out of that slow death arises misery.
One’s whole life starts stinking of death. Life is always in the
present, but for that one needs great courage: courage to detach oneself
from the past, courage not to look back, courage to leave the familiar,
courage to live in insecurity. In fact that is the definition of
sannyas: the courage to live in insecurity, to live moment to moment,
not knowing what is going to happen next... without any clinging to the
past and without any projections for the future. When one lives in the
present, life has a thrill, it becomes an adventure. Then it has
ecstasy, and that ecstasy is anand, that ecstasy is bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Courage brings bliss. And because millions of people are cowards, the
world remains in misery. It is very rarely that a courageous person
steps out of the crowd, finds his own way, lives his own life, risks
everything, becomes an individual, rebels against the crowd-mind, the
mob-mind, and declares</p><p><br></p><p>his independence. In that freedom is bliss, and in that freedom is
God. That freedom is bliss, that freedom is God.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Annelise. Anand means bliss; Anne means prayer; lise means God
– a blissful prayer for God. That has to become your very existence: a
blissful prayer to God.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is blissful when it is an expression of gratitude, with no
demands, with no complaints. Whenever one starts asking for something in
prayer, it is no longer blissful; it is praying out of misery, out of
demand, out of need. It loses its grandeur, its grace. It is nothing but
desire disguised as prayer. And that’s what goes on in the churches,
temples, mosques, in the name of prayer: people are not praying, people
are asking, demanding, people are trying to exploit even God for their
own purposes. They pray only when they are in need, they remember God
when they are in misery. They completely forget God when they are happy.
And the real prayer arises out of happiness, not Out of misery, so it is
very rarely that real prayer happens in the world, because people pray
when they are in pain and they forget completely when they are in
pleasure. When everything is going well who bothers about God and who
bothers about prayer? When something is not going right, you start
remembering God.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the life of one of the very rare men of this century,
Fyodor Dostoevsky, the Russian novelist. He was also a revolutionary,
and he was condemned to death with eleven of his other comrades. All
twelve were to be shot early in the morning at exactly six o’clock. They
were made to stand in a line and they started looking at the church
tower, at the clock, and minute by minute life was disappearing. And
Dostoevsky says in his memoirs that in those four, five moments, he
remembered his whole past.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens: when death approaches and you become aware that death is
coming – when it takes you unawares – then it doesn’t happen; but when
you know that at exactly six o’clock you will be shot dead and only five
minutes are left, one starts having a review. The whole film of the past
starts moving. And in those five minutes he remembered that he has not
lived his life attentively. He had wasted his life, he had lived as a
robot, as a machine, unconsciously, almost asleep. He could not remember
a single moment of attentiveness, of awareness. He decided, “If another
life is given to me, I will devote my whole life to awareness.” And by
chance it happened that he was forgiven; exactly one minute before, the
order from the Czar came that all those twelve had to be forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>Then somebody asked him after a few years: “What happened to your
decision?” He said, “I tried, but it didn’t work out; I could not live
attentively. I still try but... for a moment it is there and then it is
gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>People are living almost in a kind of sleep. But when pain comes,
misery comes, they are disturbed in their sleep and they start praying,
and they take great decisions that “Now, from now onwards, I will be
good, I will be this, I will be that.” But that is not true prayer. If
it comes out of pain, once the pain is gone the prayer will be gone. The
true prayer has to arise out of bliss, it has to arise out of your
gratitude to God, it has to arise out of a tremendous sense that you are
part of this great, profound mystery, that such an infinitely beautiful
universe has been given to you for no reason at all; you have not earned
it. It is a sheer gift from God. Then there is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>And if prayer is there, God is there. Wherever prayer is, God is.
People ask, “Where is God?” – their question is meaningless. They should
ask, “What is prayer?” – because wherever prayer is, God is.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is the way to see God. Prayer gives you the eyes, the
perspective to see God. So Anand Annelise will mean: a blissful prayer
to God. Let that become your existence too.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love; janine means gift of God. Love can only be a gift
from God. Man can create only commodities. Commodities have no values,
they have prices but no values, and values have no price. Values are
beyond price. And love is the greatest of all the values, the
suprememost value; everything else can be sacrificed for it, but it
cannot be sacrificed for anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to become aware that it comes from the beyond – that it descends
and we just have to be empty to receive it, a womb that we have to be
pregnant with it – that awareness and a door that has remained closed up
to now starts opening. You become capable of seeing things which you had
never suspected before. And then it pours, it simply pours. So much
comes that you cannot contain it, you have to share it with others.</p><p><br></p><p>And my sannyasin has to become a vehicle for love, a passage, just a
pure passage with no hindrance... not standing in between. Just an
emptiness, utterly empty, so that if God wants to flow through you, he
can flow without any resistance from your side. To be in that
non-resistant state is to be in meditation, and to allow God and his
love to flow through you is to be a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>A saint is one who has disappeared, who has become absent, whose
presence is no more there, in whose presence God has become present
himself, he has annihilated himself totally. That is the ultimate goal
for a sannyasin. It can be achieved, it has to be achieved, because
without it life remains unfulfilled, life remains nightmarish. With it,
life becomes paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Yusuf. Anand means blissful; I don’t know myself the meaning of
yusuf, but that doesn’t matter. Whatsoever it means, be blissful! But
suf means pure. From suf comes sufi... the purest of the heart. Yusuf
may have something to do with it. And there is a tomb in Kashmir which
is believed to be the tomb of Jesus, but the stone on it says “the tomb
of Isa Yusuf”. It seems yusuf is a form of Jesus, the Arabic form of
Jesus – the possibility is there, it is only a possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it becomes very significant. The word “jesus” means one who is
beloved of God. And Jesus is one of the greatest Sufis of the world. The
word “suf” also means clean, absolutely clean, with no dirt, a mirror
without any dirt, so that it can reflect God. But I am not certain
whether these meanings are really applicable to yusuf or not, hence I
say: be blissful! My message is bliss, and bliss brings cleanliness,
bliss brings clarity, bliss brings the kind of heart that becomes
beloved of God. It creates Jesus in you.</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole alchemy depends on the process of being blissful, then
all else follows. People have a very deep misunderstanding of bliss;
they think it is a goal. It is not a goal, it is a discipline. If you
think of bliss as a goal, then how can you be blissful right now? First
you have to prepare yourself, you have to go through many austerities,
fasts, prayers, rituals, then one day maybe sometime in the future –
maybe in this life or in other lives – you will be capable of being
blissful. To think of bliss as a goal helps you to postpone it. That’s
not my idea of bliss. Bliss is not a goal but a discipline in itself.
You can be blissful this very moment, it is only a decision on your
part.</p><p><br></p><p>It is our choice to be miserable or to be blissful. If we choose to
be blissful no power can make us miserable, and I say it through my own
experience, and through the experience of thousands of my</p><p><br></p><p>sannyasins that it is only a question of decisiveness. If you decide
to be blissful nobody can make you miserable. Even if you are thrown
into hell you will remain blissful. You will enjoy hell too; it will be
really a fantastic trip and you will meet beautiful people there!</p><p><br></p><p>Hell and heaven are not something outside you; they exist in your
eyes. The man who knows how to be miserable will be miserable even if he
is with God; he will find ways and means of being miserable. Even in
paradise he will count the thorns on the rosebushes, and the man who
knows how to be blissful, even in hell, will count the roses.</p><p><br></p><p>So let it become a fundamental rule of your life, that at each moment
you have to decide. The alternatives are always open, both alternatives,
we are always on the crossroads. You can move in the direction of
misery, you can move in the direction of bliss; always choose the
direction of bliss. Slowly slowly, it becomes natural to you, then there
is no need to choose it deliberately; you simply choose it. And to be
blissful is to be ready for God. God is the goal, not bliss; bliss is
the discipline to attain God.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Nirmohi. Anand means bliss, blissfulness; nirmohi means
non-attached.</p><p><br></p><p>Blissfulness is possible only if one remains non-attached to
everything that happens, remains unclinging to everything that happens,
does not become identified with anything. The mind immediately starts
clinging, and particularly when something beautiful is happening, the
mind naturally tends to cling more. But to cling is to miss it, to cling
is to destroy it. If you love and your love becomes possessive, you have
killed it. Now you can go on carrying a dead bird – you can put it in a
beautiful golden cage – but it cannot sing any more and it cannot fly in
the sky and it Cannot soar high in the winds, it cannot whisper with the
clouds. All life is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Nirmohi means not to be attached to anything, not to be possessive,
not to be clinging... moving through life utterly detached. It does not
mean indifference, it does not mean renunciation. Live in life, but
don’t gather the dust of experience around yourself. Each moment die to
the past so that you are again new, so that each moment you are born
again, fresh, again with the wonder of life, again with the surprise of
a child, again full of joy, intrigued with everything that is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the true way to be a sannyasin: being blissful and yet
unattached. In the East we have a metaphor for it. We say that a
sannyasin should be like a lotus leaf in the pond: the lotus leaf
remains in the water, but it is so silky that the water cannot touch it.
It remains in the water but utterly untouched by the water. So even when
dewdrops collect on the lotus leaf... In the morning you can see them,
separate. They are resting on the lotus leaf, but utterly separate like
pearls; a wind will come and they will slip back into the lake and they
will not leave a trace behind.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the way of a sannyasin: to live like a lotus leaf in the
pond. Live in the world but remain absolutely unattached,
non-possessive, non-clinging. Live as freedom, then God is yours, then
truth is yours, then you are yours!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Sanatano. Anand means bliss; sanatano means eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness is momentary, hence happiness is bound to be followed by
unhappiness. They are like day and night: one is followed by the other
inevitably. Hence even when you are happy, you cannot</p><p><br></p><p>be really happy, because deep down you know unhappiness is on the
way. Bliss means something which is timeless, a happiness which is not
followed by unhappiness. It comes and remains forever. It only happens
once, then it is forever, that’s why it is called eternal: it has a
beginning but no end. And that is the goal of life; sannyas is only a
methodology to attain it.</p><p><br></p><p>When one is finished with happiness, unhappiness, and the duality of
it, when one has had enough of it, then the journey for bliss starts,
then one starts seeking and searching for something eternal, something
deathless. That’s what has created sannyas in the East. The East is far
more ancient than the West. The West is still young, hence still
interested in the happiness-unhappiness game. The East is too ancient
for that, it has known all those games and the futility of it. Sannyas
is the greatest contribution of eastern consciousness to humanity. But
it has died in its old form. I am trying to revive it. Of course, it
will have a new form now – a new body and a new spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>The old sannyas was more of renunciation. My new sannyas is more of
rejoicing. Rejoice in life, rejoice in ordinary things, rejoice in
everything possible, rejoice even when moments are almost too difficult
to rejoice in... when sadness seems to be natural, when depression seems
to be just the right thing, when defeat and defeatism surround you, when
you are a failure, frustrated... But remember always that when the night
is very dark, the dawn is very close by.</p><p><br></p><p>So learn to rejoice even in the darkness of the night, because it
proclaims the dawn. [A sannyasin asks: How can I have more trust?]</p><p>That is really a difficult problem... Trust is not a commodity; you
cannot have more or less. It is not a quantity. Either you have it or
you don’t have it. More or less is not the question at all, it is
utterly irrelevant. You cannot have less, you cannot have more. If you
have it, you have it, don’t be worried. If you don’t have it, don’t be
worried... What is there to be worried about?</p><p><br></p><p>This is trust! If you have it, good; if you don’t have it, good.</p><p><br></p><p>Help my people there! And you have it! – don’t be worried. I certify
that you have it!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

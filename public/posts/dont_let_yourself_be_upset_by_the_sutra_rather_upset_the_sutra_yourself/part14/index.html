Deva means divine; margaret means a pearl – a divine pearl.\nMan is oblivious of his own treasures because he never looks within; his eyes are focused on the outside. He goes on searching everywhere except into his own self. The search is bound to be futile because the treasure is within; it is not without. The kingdom of God is within you, it is not without. And there are only two types of people in the world: those who look outside and those who look in. Very rare are those who look in, but those are the people who attain, those are the people who arrive, those are the people who become fulfilled.\nNo other treasure can give you contentment, because all other treasures will be taken away by death. There is only one treasure which death cannot take away from you; it is hidden in the deep recesses of your own being. It is part of you; it cannot be taken away. It is intrinsically part of you. It is you. It cannot be taken away. It cannot be burned, it cannot be destroyed. It is an invisible energy. You can call it God, you can call it nirvana, enlightenment; any name will do, because it has no name of its own.\nTo look within is to become aware of the immense glory of man, the dignity of consciousness. With that dignity, great gratitude arises towards God. You have something to be grateful for only when you have something that transcends death, that surpasses time. Only when you have something eternal in your hands can you bow down to God in thankfulness.\nThat thankfulness is sannyas, that gratitude is sannyas.\nPrem Anita. Prem means love. Anita is Hebrew; it means prayer.\nLove is prayer. Anything else other than love and prayer dies; it becomes a ritual, a formality. When love is there prayer is not a formality, not a ritual: it is something of your heart.\nWhen a Christian prays it is dead; when Christ prays it is alive. Don’t repeat prayers that have been taught to you. Rather, find out your own spontaneous response to existence – in deep love, in deep gratitude – and you will come across something arising in you... a song, a humming, or maybe just silence, but that silence too is prayerful.\nLove is the space in which prayer arises. Live love and prayer follows you like a shadow. Then the prayer is never Christian, nor Hindu, nor Mohammedan; it is simply prayer. How can prayer be Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian? How can love be Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian?\nAnd to know love is to know God, because wherever love is, prayer arises, inevitably, and prayer becomes the bridge between you and God.\nAnand Ralph. Anand means bliss; ralph literally means the wolf, but symbolically the wolf stands for courage. Your name will mean a blissful courage. And these are the necessary qualities to be a sannyasin.\nTo be religious at all one needs tremendous courage, because one will be leaving all that is known behind, all that is familiar, the whole past, and one will be entering into something absolutely unknown. Unless there is great courage one cannot enter on this path. There is no shortcut and there is no way to reach to truth conveniently, comfortably. It is arduous.\nBut just courage won’t do. The courage has to be a dancing courage, otherwise it will become heavy and it will become an ego trip. The courage has to be cheerful, blissful, the courage has to be singing, whistling, playful, then courage is beautiful; it never becomes an ego trip.\nIf you can laugh, if you can be cheerful, if you can take life non-seriously, you have taken all care that is needed to prevent the ego from arising. In playfulness the ego disappears. It is found only in misery and seriousness.\nAnand Ingrid. Anand means bliss; ingrid literally means Ing’s garden. In Norse mythology Ing is the god of fertility, crops, prosperity, peace. Your name will mean a blissful garden, a blissful garden of prosperity, peace, fertility, creativity.\nMan has to become a gardener. Man can grow many many flowers in his being. Man need not be as poor as he remains; man can be infinitely rich. Man can have all the colors of the rainbow and all the notes of music, and all the fragrances possible. Man is born as an infinite capacity to grow. The potential is unlimited, but we never work on it. The land which could have become a great garden remains barren; it remains just a desert. Then we go on crying in frustration, in despair, in depression, that life has no meaning.\nMeaning has to be created.\nMeaning is not something already given and it is good that it is not given. If meaning were also given to you then there would be nothing to create. And life would have been unbearable if there were nothing to create. It is creativity that makes life a rejoicing.\nMeaning is not given, only the potential is given. The seeds are given, the flowers you have to work for.\nSvatmo Fritz. Svatmo means your true self, one’s true self – not the ego, but that which is found when the ego is gone.\nThe ego is our own invention. It is a false entity, it is not true. If you stop supporting it, it falls flat on the ground. It needs constant cooperation from you, constant identification with you, only then can it live. It lives through you; it exploits you. But it is your own nightmare, created by you. When this nightmare disappears, that which is left behind, uncreated by you, is svatmo; that is your true self.\nAnd fritz means a peaceful ruler. Become a peaceful ruler of your own self. To rule others is ugly; to rule oneself is beautiful. To rule others is politics; to rule oneself is religion.\nAnand Sylvia. Anand means bliss; sylvia means a goddess of the woods. It symbolizes the silence of the woods, the solitude of the woods. Your full name will mean a blissful solitude.\nThere are two kinds of bliss possible: one is when you relate in love; the other is when you simply rest in your being, alone. The first is a dialogue. It is getting in tune with the other. It is finding the other’s rhythm and falling en rapport with it. The second is being in tune with your own self, just being your own self.\nIn the past both have been taken as antagonistic to each other. That has been one of the greatest calamities that has befallen humanity. Because of that, humanity became divided into two parts: the worldly people and the so-called otherworldly people. The worldly are those who enjoy relationships, all kinds of relationships; and the otherworldly – the monks, the escapists, those who escape to the mountains and the monasteries – love solitude, aloneness. They avoid relationship; they are afraid of love.\nSo the worldly person loves, but he cannot love because he does not know who he is; and the so-called religious can love because he knows who he is, but he does not love. That’s why love has disappeared from the world. Those who can love won’t allow themselves to, and those who cannot love will go on pretending that they do.\nMy effort here is to create a totally different kind of man: one who is capable of love, and not only capable but ready to love too; one who knows what solitude is; one who knows what it is to be alone and one who enjoys that aloneness immensely and yet is ready to share that joy in relationship.\nLove and meditation should become two wings of the sannyasin. With these two wings the journey to God is far easier. But up to now people have been trying to reach to God only with one wing. It has been an almost impossible job. If a few have managed that simply means that miracles happen. Even those few should have missed.\nI am making religion available to the millions: to the worldly, to the otherworldly, to those who want to live in relationship and to those who want to live in solitude. A great synthesis is needed between love and meditation, and that synthesis will create the highest peak of your consciousness, the Everest.\nDeva Bashir. Deva means god; bashir means all-seeing. It is a Sufi device; the very name “bashir” is Sufi. It has a very significant device hidden in it.\nThe Sufis say that for a few people just the idea that God is constantly seeing them helps tremendously. Whatsoever you are doing, you are being watched. Not only your action is watched, your thoughts are also being watched. Not only when you are awake are you watched but when you are asleep your dreams are being watched. There is not a single moment when God is not watching you.\nRemember, this is a device; it is neither true nor untrue. If you can use it, it can take you to truth. It is a hypothesis, and Sufis are very clear about it. They don’t talk about truth; they only talk about hypotheses. They say there are devices which are useful. And certain devices are useful for certain people more than for others. This is a device.\nDon’t ask whether it is right or wrong. Don’t ask, “Is it so, that God is watching, or is it not so?” That is irrelevant. If you can visualize for twenty-four hours a day that God is watching you, your life will be transformed. Many things that you used to do Will simply wither away. How can you do them when God is watching? And many thoughts that you used to have will not be entertained any more. You will shrink away from them because God is watching. And not only in action and thought; you will be surprised: your dreams will start changing. You will not be having the same dreams as before. If the idea sinks into your heart that God is constantly watching... even while you are dreaming, he is there.\nAnd you are a person for whom this device can be helpful, hence the name. From this moment start remembering that God is watching. Just become full of the remembrance that God is watching and you Will see changes start happening of their own accord. Things that you have never done, you will start doing. Thoughts that have never occurred to you will start occurring. Silences, pauses, intervals, will come automatically. You will start entering into new spaces, unknown to you, never even dreamed about\nUse this device – this is one of the most important Sufi devices. Prem Amira. Prem means love; amira means rich.\nLove is the only phenomenon that makes one rich, otherwise one remains poor. One may have all the wealth of the world, and still, if love is missing all is missing because without love the heart is poor. And the heart cannot find any contentment in the bank balance. The heart cannot find any joy in name, in fame, in power, in prestige – those are all mind games, ego games. The heart remains immensely aloof from all that nonsense. The heart can be satisfied only by the real thing, and love is the real thing. Love is the only real richness there is.\nBecome more loving, allow more and more love to happen, and slowly slowly, a day comes when love is no more a relationship but your very being. Then you don’t love; you are love. That is the goal of sannyas: to become love.\nThen God will come searching and seeking for you; you need not go in search of him. One who has love has the key to all the mysteries of life and existence.\nPrem Hamido. Prem means love; hamido means praiseworthy. It is a Sufi name for God. Sufis have one hundred names for God. Ninety-nine names can be uttered; the last and the real one, the hundredth, is unutterable.\nHamido is one of those ninety-nine names. It means God, the praiseworthy. All praise has to move towards God; that’s what prayer is all about. And the moment love becomes praise of God you have created the greatest opportunity possible for God to enter you. Love means that you have opened the doors of your being; you have given the invitation. Now you are available to the sun and the wind and to the rain; and these are all ways for God to approach you. When the wind knocks on your door it is God knocking on your door. And when in the morning the sunrays enter your room and wake you up, It is God telling you “Wake up! The night is over.”\nA religious man slowly slowly becomes aware that only God is, so whatsoever happens, happens through him; whatsoever happens has a message. If the birds sing, they are singing in praise of God; if the trees bloom, they are blooming in meditation; if the mountains are silent, that silence is nothing but prayer.\nAnd now, forget the whole journey that you had to make. There is nowhere to go any more, nothing has to be found any more. You have done a hard, arduous job, but you persisted; that persistence pays. You persevered.\nSooner or later God starts showering – just the right moment is needed. Sometimes it takes lives to find the right moment and the right opportunity and the right Master. At the right time you may find the right Master, but you may not be ready. Many times you may come across the right message, but you may be deaf. You may not hear, or you may hear something else; you may misunderstand, misinterpret. You may come face to face with the right Master, but you may not be able to see; your eyes may be clouded, you may be too prejudiced. But I am happy that your whole journey has been long but you have not collected much dust. Your mirror is clean, that’s why you could recognize me so easily.\nNow rest, now learn how to rest. The days of work are over. Now rest is the key for you. Rest in immense joy. Rest in the joy that you have found the way. Rest in ecstasy, that now there is no more effort, no more search, no more seeking, that you have entered the temple.\nYour sannyas is only symbolic of the entry into the temple. Now things will start happening of their own accord. The real thing always happens – you cannot do it – but before the real can happen, you have to do many things. And before one can come to the right door, one has to knock on one thousand and one doors... but that you have done! I am happy that you have come!\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says she feels guilty and sad; as if she’s missed Osho.]\nNo, no. Nothing – you have not missed anything. Just go there and help my people. You are needed there in Brazil! Much work has to be done there. Drive Brazilians crazy! And only you can do that work, right?\n[A sannyasin says: I’ve come here for the second time. The first time I left Poona I was in a state of unconditional acceptance. But this time I feel rejected.]\nNothing to be worried – it happens, mm? This is something that has been in the unconscious and has started surfacing. It will evaporate, don’t be worried.\nWe have many many layers inside. When for the first time you become a sannyasin it simply touches your first layer. Everything seems to be absolutely good, positive, you have great trust, but then soon the hidden, the repressed negativities, the nos that you have wanted to say to your parents and you have not said, the nos that you wanted to say to the society and were not able to say – they are there, waiting. So when you accept something sooner or later those nos will start creating conflict in you.\nDon’t be worried; just watch them, don’t get identified with them. Simply watch that it is part of the mind, “I am not it,” and they will all go. When you go, you will go with deeper trust; don’t be worried.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2778","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_let_yourself_be_upset_by_the_sutra_rather_upset_the_sutra_yourself/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_let_yourself_be_upset_by_the_sutra_rather_upset_the_sutra_yourself/>Don\'t Let Yourself Be Upset by the Sutra, rather Upset the Sutra Yourself</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2778 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Let_Yourself_Be_Upset_by_the_Sutra_rather_Upset_the_Sutra_Yourself/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

given, the flowers you have to work for.</p><p><br></p><p>Svatmo Fritz. Svatmo means your true self, one’s true self – not the
ego, but that which is found when the ego is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is our own invention. It is a false entity, it is not true.
If you stop supporting it, it falls flat on the ground. It needs
constant cooperation from you, constant identification with you, only
then can it live. It lives through you; it exploits you. But it is your
own nightmare, created by you. When this nightmare disappears, that
which is left behind, uncreated by you, is svatmo; that is your true
self.</p><p><br></p><p>And fritz means a peaceful ruler. Become a peaceful ruler of your own
self. To rule others is ugly; to rule oneself is beautiful. To rule
others is politics; to rule oneself is religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Sylvia. Anand means bliss; sylvia means a goddess of the woods.
It symbolizes the silence of the woods, the solitude of the woods. Your
full name will mean a blissful solitude.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of bliss possible: one is when you relate in
love; the other is when you simply rest in your being, alone. The first
is a dialogue. It is getting in tune with the other. It is finding the
other’s rhythm and falling en rapport with it. The second is being in
tune with your own self, just being your own self.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past both have been taken as antagonistic to each other. That
has been one of the greatest calamities that has befallen humanity.
Because of that, humanity became divided into two parts: the worldly
people and the so-called otherworldly people. The worldly are those who
enjoy relationships, all kinds of relationships; and the otherworldly –
the monks, the escapists, those who escape to the mountains and the
monasteries – love solitude, aloneness. They avoid relationship; they
are afraid of love.</p><p><br></p><p>So the worldly person loves, but he cannot love because he does not
know who he is; and the so-called religious can love because he knows
who he is, but he does not love. That’s why love has disappeared from
the world. Those who can love won’t allow themselves to, and those who
cannot love will go on pretending that they do.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here is to create a totally different kind of man: one who
is capable of love, and not only capable but ready to love too; one who
knows what solitude is; one who knows what it is to be alone and one who
enjoys that aloneness immensely and yet is ready to share that joy in
relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Love and meditation should become two wings of the sannyasin. With
these two wings the journey to God is far easier. But up to now people
have been trying to reach to God only with one wing. It has been an
almost impossible job. If a few have managed that simply means that
miracles happen. Even those few should have missed.</p><p><br></p><p>I am making religion available to the millions: to the worldly, to
the otherworldly, to those who want to live in relationship and to those
who want to live in solitude. A great synthesis is needed between love
and meditation, and that synthesis will create the highest peak of your
consciousness, the Everest.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Bashir. Deva means god; bashir means all-seeing. It is a Sufi
device; the very name “bashir” is Sufi. It has a very significant device
hidden in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sufis say that for a few people just the idea that God is
constantly seeing them helps tremendously. Whatsoever you are doing, you
are being watched. Not only your action is watched, your thoughts are
also being watched. Not only when you are awake are you watched but when
you are asleep your dreams are being watched. There is not a single
moment when God is not watching you.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, this is a device; it is neither true nor untrue. If you can
use it, it can take you to truth. It is a hypothesis, and Sufis are very
clear about it. They don’t talk about truth; they only talk about
hypotheses. They say there are devices which are useful. And certain
devices are useful for certain people more than for others. This is a
device.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask whether it is right or wrong. Don’t ask, “Is it so, that
God is watching, or is it not so?” That is irrelevant. If you can
visualize for twenty-four hours a day that God is watching you, your
life will be transformed. Many things that you used to do Will simply
wither away. How can you do them when God is watching? And many thoughts
that you used to have will not be entertained any more. You will shrink
away from them because God is watching. And not only in action and
thought; you will be surprised: your dreams will start changing. You
will not be having the same dreams as before. If the idea sinks into
your heart that God is constantly watching... even while you are
dreaming, he is there.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are a person for whom this device can be helpful, hence the
name. From this moment start remembering that God is watching. Just
become full of the remembrance that God is watching and you Will see
changes start happening of their own accord. Things that you have never
done, you will start doing. Thoughts that have never occurred to you
will start occurring. Silences, pauses, intervals, will come
automatically. You will start entering into new spaces, unknown to you,
never even dreamed about</p><p><br></p><p>Use this device – this is one of the most important Sufi devices.
Prem Amira. Prem means love; amira means rich.</p><p>Love is the only phenomenon that makes one rich, otherwise one
remains poor. One may have all the wealth of the world, and still, if
love is missing all is missing because without love the heart is poor.
And the heart cannot find any contentment in the bank balance. The heart
cannot find any joy in name, in fame, in power, in prestige – those are
all mind games, ego games. The heart remains immensely aloof from all
that nonsense. The heart can be satisfied only by the real thing, and
love is the real thing. Love is the only real richness there is.</p><p><br></p><p>Become more loving, allow more and more love to happen, and slowly
slowly, a day comes when love is no more a relationship but your very
being. Then you don’t love; you are love. That is the goal of sannyas:
to become love.</p><p><br></p><p>Then God will come searching and seeking for you; you need not go in
search of him. One who has love has the key to all the mysteries of life
and existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Hamido. Prem means love; hamido means praiseworthy. It is a Sufi
name for God. Sufis have one hundred names for God. Ninety-nine names
can be uttered; the last and the real one, the hundredth, is
unutterable.</p><p><br></p><p>Hamido is one of those ninety-nine names. It means God, the
praiseworthy. All praise has to move towards God; that’s what prayer is
all about. And the moment love becomes praise of God you have created
the greatest opportunity possible for God to enter you. Love means that
you have opened the doors of your being; you have given the invitation.
Now you are available to the sun and the wind and to the rain; and these
are all ways for God to approach you. When the wind knocks on your door
it is God knocking on your door. And when in the morning the sunrays
enter your room and wake you up, It is God telling you “Wake up! The
night is over.”</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man slowly slowly becomes aware that only God is, so
whatsoever happens, happens through him; whatsoever happens has a
message. If the birds sing, they are singing in praise of God; if the
trees bloom, they are blooming in meditation; if the mountains are
silent, that silence is nothing but prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, forget the whole journey that you had to make. There is
nowhere to go any more, nothing has to be found any more. You have done
a hard, arduous job, but you persisted; that persistence pays. You
persevered.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later God starts showering – just the right moment is
needed. Sometimes it takes lives to find the right moment and the right
opportunity and the right Master. At the right time you may find the
right Master, but you may not be ready. Many times you may come across
the right message, but you may be deaf. You may not hear, or you may
hear something else; you may misunderstand, misinterpret. You may come
face to face with the right Master, but you may not be able to see; your
eyes may be clouded, you may be too prejudiced. But I am happy that your
whole journey has been long but you have not collected much dust. Your
mirror is clean, that’s why you could recognize me so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Now rest, now learn how to rest. The days of work are over. Now rest
is the key for you. Rest in immense joy. Rest in the joy that you have
found the way. Rest in ecstasy, that now there is no more effort, no
more search, no more seeking, that you have entered the temple.</p><p><br></p><p>Your sannyas is only symbolic of the entry into the temple. Now
things will start happening of their own accord. The real thing always
happens – you cannot do it – but before the real can happen, you have to
do many things. And before one can come to the right door, one has to
knock on one thousand and one doors... but that you have done! I am
happy that you have come!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, says she feels guilty and sad; as if she’s
missed Osho.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, no. Nothing – you have not missed anything. Just go there and
help my people. You are needed there in Brazil! Much work has to be done
there. Drive Brazilians crazy! And only you can do that work, right?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I’ve come here for the second time. The first time
I left Poona I was in a state of unconditional acceptance. But this time
I feel rejected.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to be worried – it happens, mm? This is something that has
been in the unconscious and has started surfacing. It will evaporate,
don’t be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>We have many many layers inside. When for the first time you become a
sannyasin it simply touches your first layer. Everything seems to be
absolutely good, positive, you have great trust, but then soon the
hidden, the repressed negativities, the nos that you have wanted to say
to your parents and you have not said, the nos that you wanted to say to
the society and were not able to say – they are there, waiting. So when
you accept something sooner or later those nos will start creating
conflict in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried; just watch them, don’t get identified with them.
Simply watch that it is part of the mind, “I am not it,” and they will
all go. When you go, you will go with deeper trust; don’t be
worried.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

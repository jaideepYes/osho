‌CHAPTER 10
The Original Signature
20 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
SURELY MEDITATION IS FOR MYSTICS. WHY DO YOU PROPOSE IT FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE AND THEIR CHILDREN?
First, I have never come across an ordinary person; they do not exist. They are only created by egoistic people. The egoist has to create the ordinary – that is the only way the ego can exist, persist.</description>

The People are Sleeping
21 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
HASAN ASKED AJAMI, ‘HOW DID YOU REACH YOUR PRESENT HEIGHTS OF SPIRITUAL ATTAINMENT?’
AJAMI SAID, ‘THROUGH MAKING THE HEART WHITE IN MEDITATION, NOT BY MAKING PAPER BLACK WITH WRITING.’
LITTLE boy was playing with his blocks when his father entered the room. ‘Quiet, Dad, I am building a church.’
The father, thinking that he would test his son along the lines of religious knowledge said, ‘Why do we want to be quiet in church?</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
The ‘Instant’ Pathology
22 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR INSTANT ENLIGHTENMENT THESE DAYS AND THERE ARE ALL THESE GURUS RUNNING AROUND SAYING ‘FOLLOW ME’ AND YET IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE ANSWER IS THERE. WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS TO?
Every age has its own special pathology. Too much time-consciousness is the special pathology of this age.</description>

23 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
HASAN OF BASRA RELATES:
’I HAD CONVINCED MYSELF THAT I WAS A MAN OF HUMILITY AND LESS THAN HUMBLE IN MY THOUGHTS AND CONDUCT TO OTHERS.

OSHO, I WANT TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED. WHY DON’T YOU HELP ME?
What do you think I am here for?
As far as my own work is concerned, it is finished. I am here just for you. And all that I can do, I am doing, and all that you can do to prevent it, you are doing.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
A Lotus on the Lake of Emptiness
26 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY DO WE FORGET OUR DIVINITY? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?
You have not forgotten it, you have never known it – so how can you forget it? Forgetfulness is possible only once you have known it – and once known, it is never forgotten.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
In Hiding
12 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
HAS SUFISM ARISEN AS A REBEL AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ISLAM? OR IS IT PRE- ISLAM?
It is both. Anything that is alive is both. It is very ancient and it is very new – together, simultaneously.
Sufism is pre-Islam and yet it is a unique new phenomenon too.</description>

SHAH FIROZ, WHO IS REMEMBERED AS THE TEACHER OF MANY VERY DISTINGUISHED SUFIS, WAS OFTEN ASKED WHY HE DID NOT TEACH THEM FASTER.
HE SAID, ‘BECAUSE EVEN THE MOST DEDICATED WILL, UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT OF UNDERSTANDING, NOT BE TEACHABLE AT ALL. HE IS HERE IN THE FLESH, BUT ABSENT IN EVERY OTHER WAY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Love Cannot Deliver the Goods
14 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHEN I FEEL DEEP LOVE I FEEL SAD AT THE SAME TIME. WHY?
Real love always brings sadness. It is inevitable – because love creates a space which opens new doors to your being. Love brings a twilight situation.
In the moment of love you can see what is unreal and what is real.</description>

A MAN CAME TO BAHAUDIN SHAH AND SAID, ‘FIRST I FOLLOWED THIS TEACHER AND THEN THAT ONE. NEXT I STUDIED THESE BOOKS, AND THEN THOSE. I FEEL THAT ALTHOUGH I KNOW NOTHING OF YOU AND YOUR TEACHINGS, THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SLOWLY PREPARING ME TO LEARN FROM YOU.’
THE SHAH ANSWERED, ‘NOTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED IN THE PAST WILL HELP YOU HERE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Passion for the Impossible
16 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I AM NOT CLEAR. IS BEING A SUFI A MATTER OF WILL? IS IT A BLESSING? OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?
The Sufis have a very beautiful saying. They say, ‘God is not found by seeking, and never found by those who don’t seek.’</description>

From Robopathology to Enlightenment
17 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
NAJRANI SAID, ‘IF YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN “NEARLY UNDERSTAND”, YOU ARE TALKING NONSENSE.’
A THEOLOGIAN WHO LIKED THIS PHRASE ASKED, ‘CAN YOU GIVE US AN EQUIVALENT OF THIS IN ORDINARY LIFE?’
‘CERTAINLY,’ SAID NAJRANI. ‘IT IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS “ALMOST A CIRCLE”.’
MAN is not yet man.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
A Certain Milieu
18 August 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY DO YOU GIVE SANNYAS TO BABIES AND CHILDREN?
Sannyas can be given only to babies and children. The very idea of being an adult is a barrier. The adult mind is an adulterated mind. It is already corrupt.
The physical age is irrelevant. Somebody may be seventy years old and yet a baby, and somebody may be young and may not be innocent.</description>

HASAN CAME UPON RABIA ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS SITTING AMONG A NUMBER OF CONTEMPLATORS, AND SAID, ‘I HAVE THE CAPACITY OF WALKING ON WATER. COME, LET US BOTH GO ON TO THAT WATER YONDER, AND SITTING UPON IT CARRY OUT A SPIRITUAL DISCUSSION.’
RABIA SAID, ‘IF YOU WISH TO SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THIS AUGUST COMPANY, WHY DO YOU NOT COME WITH ME SO THAT WE MAY FLY INTO THE AIR AND SIT THERE TALKING?</description>

Renunciation has become part of almost all religions, a foundational principle.\nThe rebel is renouncing the past. He is not going to repeat the past; he is bringing something new into the world. Those who have escaped from the world and society are escapists. They have really renounced responsibilities, but without understanding that the moment you renounce responsibilities you also renounce freedom. These are the complexities of life: freedom and responsibilities go away together or remain together.\nThe more you are a lover of freedom, the more you will be ready to accept responsibilities. But outside the world, outside the society, there is no possibility of any responsibility. And it has to be remembered that all that we learn, we learn through being responsible.\nThe past has destroyed the beauty of the word ‘responsibility’. They have made it almost equivalent to duty; it is not really so. A duty is something done reluctantly, as part of your spiritual slavery. Duty to your elders, duty to your husband, duty to your children – they are not responsibilities. To understand the word ‘responsibility’ is very significant. You have to break it in two: response and ability.\nYou can act in two ways – one is reaction, another is response. Reaction comes out of your past conditionings; it is mechanical. Response comes out of your presence, awareness, consciousness; it is non-mechanical. And the ability to respond is one of the greatest principles of growth. You are not following any order, any commandment, you are simply following your awareness. You are functioning like a mirror, reflecting the situation and responding to it – not out of your memory, from past experiences of similar situations; not repeating your reactions but acting fresh, new, in this very moment. Neither is the situation old, nor is your response – both are new. This ability is one of the qualities of the rebel.\nRenouncing the world, escaping to the forest and the mountains, you are simply escaping from a learning situation. In a cave in the Himalayas you won’t have any responsibility, but remember, without responsibility you cannot grow; your consciousness will remain stuck. For growth it needs to face, to encounter, to accept the challenges of responsibilities.\nEscapists are cowards, they are not rebels – although that’s what has been thought up to now, that they are rebellious spirits. They are not, they are simply cowards. They could not cope with life. They knew their weaknesses, their frailties, and they thought it was better to escape; because then you will never have to face your weakness, your frailty, you will never come to know any challenge. But without challenges how are you going to grow?\nNo, the rebel cannot renounce the world and the society, but he certainly renounces many other things. He renounces the so-called morality imposed upon him by the society; he renounces the so-called values imposed by the society; he renounces the knowledge given by the society. He does not renounce the society as such, but he renounces everything that the society has given to him. This is true renunciation.\nThe rebel lives in the society, fighting, struggling. To remain in the crowd and not to be obedient to the crowd but to be obedient to one’s own conscience, is a tremendous opportunity for growth. It makes you bring out your best; it gives you a dignity.\nA rebel is a fighter, a warrior. But how can you be a warrior in a cave in the Himalayas? With whom are you going to fight? The rebel remains in the society, but he is no longer part of the society – that is his renunciation and that is his rebelliousness. He is not stubborn, he is not adamant, he is not an egoist; he does not just go on fighting blindly.\nIf he finds something is right he obeys it, but he obeys his own feeling of rightness, not the commandment given by others. And if he sees that it is not right he disobeys it, whatsoever the cost may be. He may accept a crucifixion, but he will not accept any spiritual slavery.\nThe situation of the rebel is tremendously exciting: each moment he is faced with problems because the society has a fixed mode, a fixed pattern, fixed ideals. And the rebel cannot go with those fixed ideals – he has to follow his own still small voice. If his heart is saying no, there is no way, no power, to force him to say yes. You can kill him, but you cannot destroy his rebellious spirit.\nHis renunciation is far greater than the renunciation of Gautam Buddha, Mahavira and millions of others – they simply renounced the society, escaped into the forest, into the mountains. It was an easier way, but very dangerous because it goes against your growth.\nThe rebel renounces the society and still remains in it, fighting moment to moment. In this way he not only grows, he also allows the society to learn that there are many things which are not right, but have been thought to be right. There are many things which are immoral but have been thought moral; there are many things which have been thought very wise, but they are really OTHERwise.\nFor example, all the societies of the world have praised virginity in women. It is a universally accepted ideal that the woman should remain a virgin before marriage. Sometimes there is a small, thin barrier of skin in a woman’s vagina and if the woman makes love to somebody, that small barrier prevents the sperm from going to the egg.\nThe first thing the man is interested to know about is the small barrier, whether it is intact or not. If it is not intact then the girl is not a virgin. Sometimes riding on a horse or climbing a tree or in an accident, that small barrier can be broken, can have holes, although the girl is a virgin.\nIn the Middle Ages it was impossible to get a husband for her, so there were doctors who used to make an artificial skin barrier and fix it so that the woman looked virgin, whether she was virgin or not. Stupidity has no limits.\nIn fact, virginity should not be a part of a truly understanding society. Virginity means the woman remains unaware of what she is going to face after marriage. A more compassionate society will allow boys and girls to know sex before they get married so they know exactly what they are going for, whether they want to go for it or not. And a woman should be allowed to know as many people before marriage as possible – and the same applies to the man – because before deciding on a right partner, the only way to know is to have experiences with many partners, different types of people.\nBut ignorance has been propounded in the name of virginity, in the name of morality.\nIgnorance cannot be supported on any grounds. If in the world married people are so miserable, one of the major reasons is that they were not allowed to know many women, many men, before their marriage; otherwise they would have chosen, with more understanding, the right person who fits harmoniously with them.\nAstrologers are consulted – as if the stars are worried about whom you get married to, as if the stars are at all interested in you! Palmists are consulted, as if there are lines on your hand which can give indications for a right partner. Birth charts are consulted... all these things are absolutely irrelevant. When you were born and when the woman was born has no relationship to the life that you are going to live. But these were rationalizations. Man was trying to console himself that he has been trying every possible way to find the right partner.\nThere is only one way to find the right partner: that is, allow young boys and young girls to mix with as many partners as possible, so they can know the differences between women, the differences between men. Then they can come to know with whom they are polar opposites, with whom they are just lukewarm, with whom they are passionately in a harmony. Except that, there is no way of finding the right partner.\nA man of rebellious spirit will have to be aware about every ideal, howsoever ancient, and will respond according to his awareness and understanding – not according to the conditioning of the society. That is true renunciation.\nLao Tzu, an authentic rebel – more authentic than Gautam Buddha and Mahavira, because he remained in the world and fought in the world – lived according to his own light, struggling, not escaping. He became so wise that the emperor invited him to become his prime minister. He simply refused. He said, “It won’t work because it is improbable that we can come to the same conclusions about things. You live according to the ideals your forefathers have given to you; I live according to my own conscience.” But the emperor was insistent; he could not see that there was any problem.\nThe very first day in his court a thief was brought in; he had been caught red-handed, stealing from the richest man in the capital – and he confessed that he was stealing. Lao Tzu gave six months in jail to both the rich man and the thief. The rich man said, “What? I have been robbed, I am a victim and I am being punished? Are you mad or something? There is no precedent in history that a man whose money has been stolen should be punished.”\nLao Tzu said, “In fact, you should be given a longer term in jail than the thief – I am being much too compassionate – because you have gathered all the money of the city. Do you think money showers from the sky? Who has made these people so poor that they have to become thieves? You are responsible.\n“And this will be my judgment in every case of stealing; both persons will go to jail. Your crime is far deeper, his crime is nothing. He is poor and you are responsible for it. And if he was stealing a little bit of money from your treasures, it was not much of a crime. That money belongs to many of the poor people from whom you got it. You went on becoming richer and richer and many more people went on becoming poorer and poorer.”\nThe rich man thought, “This man seems to be crazy, utterly crazy.” He said, “I want one chance to see the emperor.” He was so rich that even the emperor used to borrow money from him. He told the emperor what had happened. He said to him, “If you don’t remove this man from the court you will be behind bars just like me – because from where have you got all your treasures? If I am a criminal, you are a far bigger criminal.”\nThe emperor saw the logic of the situation. He told Lao Tzu, “Perhaps you were right that it will be difficult for us to come to the same conclusions. You are relieved from your services.”\nThis man was a rebel; he lived in the society, he struggled in the society. A rebellious mind can only think the way he thought. He was not reacting – otherwise there were precedents and law books. He was not looking in the law books and the precedents; he was looking inside his own self, watching the situation. Why are so many people poor? Who is responsible for it? Certainly those who have become too rich are the real criminals.\nA rebel will renounce ideals, morals, religions, philosophies, rituals and superstitions of the society, but not the society itself. He is not a coward, he is a warrior. He has to fight his way and he has to make paths for other rebels to follow.\nAs far as the world is concerned... and the world and the society are not the same thing. In the past, the so-called religious people have renounced the society and the world, both. The rebel will fight against the society, renounce its ideals, and he will love the world – because the world, the existence, is our very source of life. To renounce it is to be anti-life. But all religions have been anti-life, life-negative.\nThe rebel should be life-affirmative. He will bring in all those values which make the world more beautiful, more lovable, which make the world more rich. It is our world – we are part of it, it is part of us – how can we renounce it? Where can we go to renounce it? The world is in the Himalayan cave as much as it is here in the marketplace.\nThe world has to be nourished because it is nourishing you. The world has to be respected because it is your very source of life. All the juice that flows in you, all the joys and celebrations that happen to you, come from existence itself. Rather than running away from it, you should dive deeper into it; you should send your roots to deeper sources of life and love and laughter. You should dance and celebrate.\nYour celebration will bring you closer to existence, because existence is in constant celebration. Your joy, your blissfulness, your silence, will bring the silences of the stars and the sky; your peace with existence will open the doors of all the mysteries it contains. There is no other way to become enlightened.\nThe world has not to be condemned, it has to be respected. The rebel will honor existence, he will have immense reverence for life in whatsoever form it exists – for men, for women, for trees, for mountains, for stars. In whatever form life exists, the rebel will have a deep reverence. That will be his gratitude, that will be his prayer, that will be his religion, that will be his revolution.\nTo be a rebel is the beginning of a totally new kind of life, a totally new style of life; it is the beginning of a new humanity, of a new man.\nI would like the whole world to be rebellious, because only in that rebelliousness will we blossom to our full potential, will we release our fragrances. We will not be repressed individuals, as man has remained for centuries... the most repressed animal. Even birds are far more free, far more natural, far more in tune with nature.\nWhen the sun rises, it does not knock on every tree, “Wake up, the night is over.” It does not go to every nest of birds, “Start singing, it is time for song.” No, just as the sun rises, the flowers start opening on their own accord. And the birds start singing – not by an order from above, but from an intrinsic inevitability, from a joy, from a blissfulness.\nOnce I used to be a professor in a Sanskrit college. Since there were no professors’ quarters immediately available and I was alone, they made arrangements for me to live in the hostel with the students. It was a Sanskrit college, following the old traditional way: each morning every student had to wake up at four o’clock, had to take a cold shower and line up by five for prayer.\nFor many years I used to wake up on my own in the darkness of the very early morning... and they were not even aware that I had come as a professor, because I had not started teaching yet.\nIt was a mistake on the part of the government to send me to that college, because I had no qualifications to teach Sanskrit. It took six months for the government to correct their mistake. Bureaucracy moves slowest, just as light moves fastest. They are the two polar opposites: light and bureaucracy.\nSo I had no business there and the students had no idea that I was a professor... and instead of prayer they were all abusing God, abusing the principal, abusing the whole ritual; in the cold of winter taking a cold shower – it was absolutely compulsory.\nI heard this situation. I said, “This is strange... instead of being in prayer, they are doing just the opposite. Perhaps these six years in this college will be enough for them: they will never pray again in their whole lives. They will never wake up early, never again. These six years of torture will be enough of an experience.”\nI told the principal, “It is not right to make prayer compulsory. Prayer cannot be made compulsory; love cannot be made compulsory.”\nHe said, “No, it is not a question of compulsion. Even if I remove the order that it is compulsory, they will still pray.”\nI said, “You try it”\nHe removed the order. Except for me, nobody woke up at four o’clock. I went and knocked on the principal’s door at four o’clock. He himself was asleep – he was always asleep, he never participated in the prayer himself. I said, “Now come on and see; not a single student out of five hundred has woken up, and not a single student is praying.”\nThe birds do not sing out of compulsion. This cuckoo is not singing because of any presidential order, because of an emergency – it is simply rejoicing with the sun, with the trees.\nExistence is a constant celebration. The flowers have opened their petals not because of any order – it is not a duty. It is a response – a response to the sun, a respect, a prayer, a gratitude.\nA rebel lives naturally, responds naturally, becomes at home and at ease with existence. He is an existential being. That defines the rebel correctly: the existential being. Existence is his temple, existence is his holy scripture, existence is his whole philosophy. He is not an existentialist, he is existential; it is his experience.\nHe is at ease with the trees, with the rivers, with the mountains. He does not renounce, he has no condemnation; he has only great honor in his heart, and gratitude. To me, this gratitude is the only prayer.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nCAN WE HELP EACH OTHER? CAN I BE HELPFUL TO SOMEONE, CAN SOMEONE HELP ME?\nIS BECOMING AFLAME THE ONLY WAY TO BE REALLY HELPFUL? PLEASE, THROW SOME LIGHT.\nSarjano, the blind cannot help the blind. Those who are groping in darkness cannot lead others to light. Those who don’t know immortality cannot help others to drop the fear of death. Those who are\nnot living totally and intensely, whose song is not yet of the heart, whose smile is only a painted smile on the lips, cannot help others to be authentic and sincere. Those who are hypocrites, pretenders, cannot help others to be honest.\nThose who are not yet themselves, know nothing about themselves, have no idea of their individuality, who are still lost in their personality which is fake and created by the society, cannot help anybody else to attain individuality. Even with all good intentions, it is simply not possible.\nIf your flame of life is not burning, how can you make the unlit lamps of others aflame? You have to be aflame, Sarjano; only then can you put others on fire.\nThis is what I mean by being a rebel: you have to be rebellious, then you can spread rebellion all around you. If you are on fire, aflame, you can create a wildfire which goes faraway beyond your vision. But first you have to be aflame.\nThe blind man leading another blind man... Kabir says both fall into the well. His original words are: ANDHA ANDHAM THELIA DONO KOOP PADANT. “The blind led the blind and both have fallen into the well.”\nYou have to have eyes to lead the blind to a physician – there is no other way. You can only share with others that which you have got: if you are miserable, you will share your misery. When two miserable persons are together the misery is not only doubled, it is multiplied. The same is true about your blissfulness, the same is true about your rebelliousness, the same is true about all experiences.\nWhatever you want the world to be, you will have to be a model first. You have to pass through a fire test to prove your philosophy of life by your example. You cannot just go on arguing about it. Reasoning and argument will not help; only your experience can give to others the taste of love, of meditation, of silence, of rebelliousness, of religion.\nBefore you have experienced, never try to help anybody – because you will simply mess up the other person more. They are messed up already. Centuries of heritage have been messing up everybody. It will be very kind of you not to help, because it is going to be dangerous; your help will be very risky for the other person.\nFirst travel the path, know perfectly well where it leads – only then can you hold the hands of others and take them on the path.\nAn American Jewish visitor in Russia says to his guide, “In America I can say that Ronald Reagan is an idiot and nothing would happen to me.”\nThe guide says, “You can say that in Russia and they will give you a medal.”\nIt is very difficult in this world to communicate. You have to learn how to communicate your experiences so that what reaches others is exactly what you want to say; otherwise you may be thinking of sharing nectar and it may turn into poison in their lives. They are poisoned enough already!\nIt is better to first cleanse yourself, make your eyes more transparent so that you can see better. Perhaps – then too, perhaps – you may be able to help others. The desire is good, but good does not happen just from good desires.\nThe ancient saying is that the way to hell is paved with good intentions. There are millions of people who are helping with good intentions, advising others – not even bothering about the simple fact that they don’t follow their own advice. But just the joy of advising is so much... who cares whether I follow my own advice or not?\nThe joy of advising others is a very subtle, egoistic joy. The person you are advising becomes ignorant; you become knowledgeable. Advice is the only thing in the world which everybody gives and nobody takes; and it is good that nobody takes it because it is given by people who know nothing – although there is no bad intention behind it.\nYou are asking a very compassionate question – but in the very nature of things, if you want to change the world, you have to change yourself first. The revolution must come to you first. Only then can you radiate it into others’ hearts.

renounced the world and society. Renunciation has become part of almost
all religions, a foundational principle.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel is renouncing the past. He is not going to repeat the past;
he is bringing something new into the world. Those who have escaped from
the world and society are escapists. They have really renounced
responsibilities, but without understanding that the moment you renounce
responsibilities you also renounce freedom. These are the complexities
of life: freedom and responsibilities go away together or remain
together.</p><p><br></p><p>The more you are a lover of freedom, the more you will be ready to
accept responsibilities. But outside the world, outside the society,
there is no possibility of any responsibility. And it has to be
remembered that all that we learn, we learn through being
responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>The past has destroyed the beauty of the word ‘responsibility’. They
have made it almost equivalent to duty; it is not really so. A duty is
something done reluctantly, as part of your spiritual slavery. Duty to
your elders, duty to your husband, duty to your children – they are not
responsibilities. To understand the word ‘responsibility’ is very
significant. You have to break it in two: response and ability.</p><p>You can act in two ways – one is reaction, another is response.
Reaction comes out of your past conditionings; it is mechanical.
Response comes out of your presence, awareness, consciousness; it is
non-mechanical. And the ability to respond is one of the greatest
principles of growth. You are not following any order, any commandment,
you are simply following your awareness. You are functioning like a
mirror, reflecting the situation and responding to it – not out of your
memory, from past experiences of similar situations; not repeating your
reactions but acting fresh, new, in this very moment. Neither is the
situation old, nor is your response – both are new. This ability is one
of the qualities of the rebel.</p><p><br></p><p>Renouncing the world, escaping to the forest and the mountains, you
are simply escaping from a learning situation. In a cave in the
Himalayas you won’t have any responsibility, but remember, without
responsibility you cannot grow; your consciousness will remain stuck.
For growth it needs to face, to encounter, to accept the challenges of
responsibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Escapists are cowards, they are not rebels – although that’s what has
been thought up to now, that they are rebellious spirits. They are not,
they are simply cowards. They could not cope with life. They knew their
weaknesses, their frailties, and they thought it was better to escape;
because then you will never have to face your weakness, your frailty,
you will never come to know any challenge. But without challenges how
are you going to grow?</p><p><br></p><p>No, the rebel cannot renounce the world and the society, but he
certainly renounces many other things. He renounces the so-called
morality imposed upon him by the society; he renounces the so-called
values imposed by the society; he renounces the knowledge given by the
society. He does not renounce the society as such, but he renounces
everything that the society has given to him. This is true
renunciation.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel lives in the society, fighting, struggling. To remain in
the crowd and not to be obedient to the crowd but to be obedient to
one’s own conscience, is a tremendous opportunity for growth. It makes
you bring out your best; it gives you a dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>A rebel is a fighter, a warrior. But how can you be a warrior in a
cave in the Himalayas? With whom are you going to fight? The rebel
remains in the society, but he is no longer part of the society – that
is his renunciation and that is his rebelliousness. He is not stubborn,
he is not adamant, he is not an egoist; he does not just go on fighting
blindly.</p><p><br></p><p>If he finds something is right he obeys it, but he obeys his own
feeling of rightness, not the commandment given by others. And if he
sees that it is not right he disobeys it, whatsoever the cost may be. He
may accept a crucifixion, but he will not accept any spiritual
slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>The situation of the rebel is tremendously exciting: each moment he
is faced with problems because the society has a fixed mode, a fixed
pattern, fixed ideals. And the rebel cannot go with those fixed ideals –
he has to follow his own still small voice. If his heart is saying no,
there is no way, no power, to force him to say yes. You can kill him,
but you cannot destroy his rebellious spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>His renunciation is far greater than the renunciation of Gautam
Buddha, Mahavira and millions of others – they simply renounced the
society, escaped into the forest, into the mountains. It was an easier
way, but very dangerous because it goes against your growth.</p><p>The rebel renounces the society and still remains in it, fighting
moment to moment. In this way he not only grows, he also allows the
society to learn that there are many things which are not right, but
have been thought to be right. There are many things which are immoral
but have been thought moral; there are many things which have been
thought very wise, but they are really OTHERwise.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, all the societies of the world have praised virginity in
women. It is a universally accepted ideal that the woman should remain a
virgin before marriage. Sometimes there is a small, thin barrier of skin
in a woman’s vagina and if the woman makes love to somebody, that small
barrier prevents the sperm from going to the egg.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing the man is interested to know about is the small
barrier, whether it is intact or not. If it is not intact then the girl
is not a virgin. Sometimes riding on a horse or climbing a tree or in an
accident, that small barrier can be broken, can have holes, although the
girl is a virgin.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Middle Ages it was impossible to get a husband for her, so
there were doctors who used to make an artificial skin barrier and fix
it so that the woman looked virgin, whether she was virgin or not.
Stupidity has no limits.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, virginity should not be a part of a truly understanding
society. Virginity means the woman remains unaware of what she is going
to face after marriage. A more compassionate society will allow boys and
girls to know sex before they get married so they know exactly what they
are going for, whether they want to go for it or not. And a woman should
be allowed to know as many people before marriage as possible – and the
same applies to the man – because before deciding on a right partner,
the only way to know is to have experiences with many partners,
different types of people.</p><p><br></p><p>But ignorance has been propounded in the name of virginity, in the
name of morality.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignorance cannot be supported on any grounds. If in the world married
people are so miserable, one of the major reasons is that they were not
allowed to know many women, many men, before their marriage; otherwise
they would have chosen, with more understanding, the right person who
fits harmoniously with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrologers are consulted – as if the stars are worried about whom
you get married to, as if the stars are at all interested in you!
Palmists are consulted, as if there are lines on your hand which can
give indications for a right partner. Birth charts are consulted... all
these things are absolutely irrelevant. When you were born and when the
woman was born has no relationship to the life that you are going to
live. But these were rationalizations. Man was trying to console himself
that he has been trying every possible way to find the right
partner.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one way to find the right partner: that is, allow young
boys and young girls to mix with as many partners as possible, so they
can know the differences between women, the differences between men.
Then they can come to know with whom they are polar opposites, with whom
they are just lukewarm, with whom they are passionately in a harmony.
Except that, there is no way of finding the right partner.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of rebellious spirit will have to be aware about every ideal,
howsoever ancient, and will respond according to his awareness and
understanding – not according to the conditioning of the society. That
is true renunciation.</p><p>Lao Tzu, an authentic rebel – more authentic than Gautam Buddha and
Mahavira, because he remained in the world and fought in the world –
lived according to his own light, struggling, not escaping. He became so
wise that the emperor invited him to become his prime minister. He
simply refused. He said, “It won’t work because it is improbable that we
can come to the same conclusions about things. You live according to the
ideals your forefathers have given to you; I live according to my own
conscience.” But the emperor was insistent; he could not see that there
was any problem.</p><p><br></p><p>The very first day in his court a thief was brought in; he had been
caught red-handed, stealing from the richest man in the capital – and he
confessed that he was stealing. Lao Tzu gave six months in jail to both
the rich man and the thief. The rich man said, “What? I have been
robbed, I am a victim and I am being punished? Are you mad or something?
There is no precedent in history that a man whose money has been stolen
should be punished.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu said, “In fact, you should be given a longer term in jail
than the thief – I am being much too compassionate – because you have
gathered all the money of the city. Do you think money showers from the
sky? Who has made these people so poor that they have to become thieves?
You are responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this will be my judgment in every case of stealing; both persons
will go to jail. Your crime is far deeper, his crime is nothing. He is
poor and you are responsible for it. And if he was stealing a little bit
of money from your treasures, it was not much of a crime. That money
belongs to many of the poor people from whom you got it. You went on
becoming richer and richer and many more people went on becoming poorer
and poorer.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man thought, “This man seems to be crazy, utterly crazy.” He
said, “I want one chance to see the emperor.” He was so rich that even
the emperor used to borrow money from him. He told the emperor what had
happened. He said to him, “If you don’t remove this man from the court
you will be behind bars just like me – because from where have you got
all your treasures? If I am a criminal, you are a far bigger
criminal.”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor saw the logic of the situation. He told Lao Tzu, “Perhaps
you were right that it will be difficult for us to come to the same
conclusions. You are relieved from your services.”</p><p><br></p><p>This man was a rebel; he lived in the society, he struggled in the
society. A rebellious mind can only think the way he thought. He was not
reacting – otherwise there were precedents and law books. He was not
looking in the law books and the precedents; he was looking inside his
own self, watching the situation. Why are so many people poor? Who is
responsible for it? Certainly those who have become too rich are the
real criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>A rebel will renounce ideals, morals, religions, philosophies,
rituals and superstitions of the society, but not the society itself. He
is not a coward, he is a warrior. He has to fight his way and he has to
make paths for other rebels to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as the world is concerned... and the world and the society are
not the same thing. In the past, the so-called religious people have
renounced the society and the world, both. The rebel will fight against
the society, renounce its ideals, and he will love the world – because
the world, the existence, is our very source of life. To renounce it is
to be anti-life. But all religions have been anti-life,
life-negative.</p><p>The rebel should be life-affirmative. He will bring in all those
values which make the world more beautiful, more lovable, which make the
world more rich. It is our world – we are part of it, it is part of us –
how can we renounce it? Where can we go to renounce it? The world is in
the Himalayan cave as much as it is here in the marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>The world has to be nourished because it is nourishing you. The world
has to be respected because it is your very source of life. All the
juice that flows in you, all the joys and celebrations that happen to
you, come from existence itself. Rather than running away from it, you
should dive deeper into it; you should send your roots to deeper sources
of life and love and laughter. You should dance and celebrate.</p><p><br></p><p>Your celebration will bring you closer to existence, because
existence is in constant celebration. Your joy, your blissfulness, your
silence, will bring the silences of the stars and the sky; your peace
with existence will open the doors of all the mysteries it contains.
There is no other way to become enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The world has not to be condemned, it has to be respected. The rebel
will honor existence, he will have immense reverence for life in
whatsoever form it exists – for men, for women, for trees, for
mountains, for stars. In whatever form life exists, the rebel will have
a deep reverence. That will be his gratitude, that will be his prayer,
that will be his religion, that will be his revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a rebel is the beginning of a totally new kind of life, a
totally new style of life; it is the beginning of a new humanity, of a
new man.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like the whole world to be rebellious, because only in that
rebelliousness will we blossom to our full potential, will we release
our fragrances. We will not be repressed individuals, as man has
remained for centuries... the most repressed animal. Even birds are far
more free, far more natural, far more in tune with nature.</p><p><br></p><p>When the sun rises, it does not knock on every tree, “Wake up, the
night is over.” It does not go to every nest of birds, “Start singing,
it is time for song.” No, just as the sun rises, the flowers start
opening on their own accord. And the birds start singing – not by an
order from above, but from an intrinsic inevitability, from a joy, from
a blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I used to be a professor in a Sanskrit college. Since there were
no professors’ quarters immediately available and I was alone, they made
arrangements for me to live in the hostel with the students. It was a
Sanskrit college, following the old traditional way: each morning every
student had to wake up at four o’clock, had to take a cold shower and
line up by five for prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>For many years I used to wake up on my own in the darkness of the
very early morning... and they were not even aware that I had come as a
professor, because I had not started teaching yet.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a mistake on the part of the government to send me to that
college, because I had no qualifications to teach Sanskrit. It took six
months for the government to correct their mistake. Bureaucracy moves
slowest, just as light moves fastest. They are the two polar opposites:
light and bureaucracy.</p><p>So I had no business there and the students had no idea that I was a
professor... and instead of prayer they were all abusing God, abusing
the principal, abusing the whole ritual; in the cold of winter taking a
cold shower – it was absolutely compulsory.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard this situation. I said, “This is strange... instead of being
in prayer, they are doing just the opposite. Perhaps these six years in
this college will be enough for them: they will never pray again in
their whole lives. They will never wake up early, never again. These six
years of torture will be enough of an experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told the principal, “It is not right to make prayer compulsory.
Prayer cannot be made compulsory; love cannot be made compulsory.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, it is not a question of compulsion. Even if I remove
the order that it is compulsory, they will still pray.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You try it”</p><p><br></p><p>He removed the order. Except for me, nobody woke up at four o’clock.
I went and knocked on the principal’s door at four o’clock. He himself
was asleep – he was always asleep, he never participated in the prayer
himself. I said, “Now come on and see; not a single student out of five
hundred has woken up, and not a single student is praying.”</p><p><br></p><p>The birds do not sing out of compulsion. This cuckoo is not singing
because of any presidential order, because of an emergency – it is
simply rejoicing with the sun, with the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is a constant celebration. The flowers have opened their
petals not because of any order – it is not a duty. It is a response – a
response to the sun, a respect, a prayer, a gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>A rebel lives naturally, responds naturally, becomes at home and at
ease with existence. He is an existential being. That defines the rebel
correctly: the existential being. Existence is his temple, existence is
his holy scripture, existence is his whole philosophy. He is not an
existentialist, he is existential; it is his experience.</p><p><br></p><p>He is at ease with the trees, with the rivers, with the mountains. He
does not renounce, he has no condemnation; he has only great honor in
his heart, and gratitude. To me, this gratitude is the only prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>CAN WE HELP EACH OTHER? CAN I BE HELPFUL TO SOMEONE, CAN SOMEONE HELP
ME?</p><p><br></p><p>IS BECOMING AFLAME THE ONLY WAY TO BE REALLY HELPFUL? PLEASE, THROW
SOME LIGHT.</p><p><br></p><p>Sarjano, the blind cannot help the blind. Those who are groping in
darkness cannot lead others to light. Those who don’t know immortality
cannot help others to drop the fear of death. Those who are</p><p>not living totally and intensely, whose song is not yet of the heart,
whose smile is only a painted smile on the lips, cannot help others to
be authentic and sincere. Those who are hypocrites, pretenders, cannot
help others to be honest.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are not yet themselves, know nothing about themselves, have
no idea of their individuality, who are still lost in their personality
which is fake and created by the society, cannot help anybody else to
attain individuality. Even with all good intentions, it is simply not
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>If your flame of life is not burning, how can you make the unlit
lamps of others aflame? You have to be aflame, Sarjano; only then can
you put others on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I mean by being a rebel: you have to be rebellious, then
you can spread rebellion all around you. If you are on fire, aflame, you
can create a wildfire which goes faraway beyond your vision. But first
you have to be aflame.</p><p><br></p><p>The blind man leading another blind man... Kabir says both fall into
the well. His original words are: ANDHA ANDHAM THELIA DONO KOOP PADANT.
“The blind led the blind and both have fallen into the well.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to have eyes to lead the blind to a physician – there is no
other way. You can only share with others that which you have got: if
you are miserable, you will share your misery. When two miserable
persons are together the misery is not only doubled, it is multiplied.
The same is true about your blissfulness, the same is true about your
rebelliousness, the same is true about all experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you want the world to be, you will have to be a model first.
You have to pass through a fire test to prove your philosophy of life by
your example. You cannot just go on arguing about it. Reasoning and
argument will not help; only your experience can give to others the
taste of love, of meditation, of silence, of rebelliousness, of
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you have experienced, never try to help anybody – because you
will simply mess up the other person more. They are messed up already.
Centuries of heritage have been messing up everybody. It will be very
kind of you not to help, because it is going to be dangerous; your help
will be very risky for the other person.</p><p><br></p><p>First travel the path, know perfectly well where it leads – only then
can you hold the hands of others and take them on the path.</p><p><br></p><p>An American Jewish visitor in Russia says to his guide, “In America I
can say that Ronald Reagan is an idiot and nothing would happen to
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guide says, “You can say that in Russia and they will give you a
medal.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult in this world to communicate. You have to learn
how to communicate your experiences so that what reaches others is
exactly what you want to say; otherwise you may be thinking of sharing
nectar and it may turn into poison in their lives. They are poisoned
enough already!</p><p>It is better to first cleanse yourself, make your eyes more
transparent so that you can see better. Perhaps – then too, perhaps –
you may be able to help others. The desire is good, but good does not
happen just from good desires.</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient saying is that the way to hell is paved with good
intentions. There are millions of people who are helping with good
intentions, advising others – not even bothering about the simple fact
that they don’t follow their own advice. But just the joy of advising is
so much... who cares whether I follow my own advice or not?</p><p><br></p><p>The joy of advising others is a very subtle, egoistic joy. The person
you are advising becomes ignorant; you become knowledgeable. Advice is
the only thing in the world which everybody gives and nobody takes; and
it is good that nobody takes it because it is given by people who know
nothing – although there is no bad intention behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking a very compassionate question – but in the very nature
of things, if you want to change the world, you have to change yourself
first. The revolution must come to you first. Only then can you radiate
it into others’ hearts. First the dance must happen to you, and then you
will see a miracle: that others have started dancing too.</p><p><br></p><p>The dance is catching; so is love, so is gratitude, so is
religiousness, so is rebellion – they are all contagious. But first you
must have the flame that you want to see in others’ eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

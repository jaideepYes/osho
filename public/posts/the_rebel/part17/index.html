ACTUALLY, I DON’T REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.\nJUST, PLEASE, DON’T STOP DOING IT.\nManeesha, every crowd is a motley crowd, but no individual is motley. Every individual is an authentic consciousness. The moment he becomes a part of the crowd, he loses his consciousness; then he is dominated by the collective, mechanical mind.\nYou are asking me what I am doing? I am doing a simple thing – bringing out individuals from the motley crowds, giving them their individuality and dignity.\nI don’t want any crowds in the world. Whether they have gathered in the name of religion, or in the name of nationality, or in the name of race, it does not matter. The crowd as such is ugly, and the crowd has committed the greatest crimes in the world, because the crowd has no consciousness. It is a collective unconsciousness.\nConsciousness makes one an individual – a solitary pine tree dancing in the wind, a solitary sunlit mountain peak in its utter glory and beauty, a solitary lion and his tremendously beautiful roar that goes on echoing for miles in the valleys.\n161\nThe crowd is always of sheep; and all the efforts of the past have been to convert every individual into a cog in the wheel, into a dead part of a dead crowd. The more unconscious he is and the more his behavior is dominated by the collectivity, the less dangerous he is. In fact, he becomes almost harmless. He cannot destroy even his own slavery.\nOn the contrary, he starts glorifying his own slavery – his religion, his nation, his race, his color. These are his slaveries, but he starts glorifying them. As an individual he belongs to no crowd. Every child is born as an individual, but rarely does a man die as an individual.\nMy work is to help you meet your death with the same innocence, with the same integrity, with the same individuality as you have met your birth.\nBetween your birth and your death your dance should remain a conscious, solitary reaching to the stars; alone, uncompromising – a rebellious spirit. Unless you have a rebellious spirit, you don’t have a spirit at all. There is no other kind of spirit available.\nAnd you can rest assured that I am not going to stop! That’s my only joy – to make as many people as possible free from their bondages, dark cells, their handcuffs, their chains; to bring them into light, so they can also know the beauties of this planet, the beauty of this sky, the beauties of this existence. Other than that, there is no God, and no God’s temple.\nIn freedom you can enter the temple. In a collectivity, in a crowd, you simply go on clinging to the corpses of the past. A man living according to the crowd has stopped living. He is simply following like a robot.\nPerhaps robots are also a little bit more individual than the so-called individual in the crowd... because just now in Japan there are one hundred thousand robots – mechanical men – working in the factories. Suddenly, within these two months, a strange phenomenon is happening. The government is worried, the scientists are worried, and they have not been able to find any explanation. Up to now the robots have been working silently; nobody had ever thought that they would suddenly start a rebellion. But ten people have been killed within two months.\nA robot is working – and a robot works according to a computer, according to a pre-programmed plan; he cannot go in any way that is different from the program that has been fed into it. But, strangely enough, these ten robots suddenly stopped working, got hold of some man who was around, and just killed him. The figure of ten men being killed is from the government – it cannot be true. No government speaks the truth.\nMy own experience is that it is always good to multiply all the figures given by the government by at least ten. If they are saying ten persons have died, one hundred persons must have died, or more. They are trying to pacify the masses – “Don’t be worried, we will find what went wrong.” But they have no idea.\nIn fact, any act that is not programmed into the computer, the robot is not capable of doing – and these were not the programs. The robots showed some sign of freedom, they showed some sign of individuality, some indication of rebellion.\nComputers cannot answer any new questions. They can answer only questions for which information has already been given to them. Naturally they don’t have any intelligence, they have only a memory system, a filing system which records. Of course, they are perfect in their efficiency. No man can be that perfect, once in a while you forget. And it is absolutely necessary, for life to go on, to forget most of the unnecessary things that are happening every day – otherwise your memory system will be too loaded. But the computer is a mechanism. You cannot load it too much, it has no life.\nI have heard... a man was asking a computer, “Can you tell me where my father is?” He was just joking with the scientist who was working on that great computer, and the computer said, “Your father? He went fishing just three hours ago.”\nThe man laughed and said to the scientist, “You are creating a stupid computer. My father has been dead for three years.”\nAnd he was shocked that the computer laughed – for which it was never programmed – and said, “Don’t be gullible. It was not your father who died three years ago, it was only the husband of your mother. Your father has gone fishing three hours ago; you can go to the beach and you will meet him.”\nRight now this is only a story, but looking at the actual facts happening in Japan, the story takes on a certain reality.\nBut man in the crowd has always behaved blindly. If you pull the same man out of the crowd and ask him, “What were you doing? Can you do it alone, on your own?” he will feel embarrassed. And you will be surprised to hear his answer: “On my own I cannot do such a stupid thing, but when I am in a crowd something strange happens.”\nFor twenty years I lived in a city which was proportionately divided, half and half, into Hindus and Mohammedans. They were equally powerful, and almost every year riots happened. I used to know a professor in the university where I was teaching. I could never have dreamed that this man could put fire to a Hindu temple; he was such a gentleman – nice, well educated, well cultured. When there was a riot between the Hindus and the Mohammedans I was watching, standing by the roadside. Mohammedans were burning a Hindu temple, Hindus were burning a Mohammedan mosque.\nI saw this professor engaged in burning the Hindu temple. I pulled him out and I asked, “Professor Farid, what are you doing?”.\nHe became very embarrassed. He said, “I’m sorry, I got lost in the crowd. Because everybody else was doing it, I forgot my own responsibility – everybody else was responsible. I felt for the first time a tremendous freedom from responsibility. Nobody can blame me. It was a Mohammedan crowd, and I was just part of it.”\nOn another occasion, a Mohammedan’s watch shop was being looted. It was the most precious collection of watches. An old Hindu priest... The people who were taking away those watches and destroying the shop – they had killed the shop owner – were all Hindus. An old priest I was acquainted with was standing on the steps and shouting very angrily at the people, “What are you doing? This is against our religion, against our morality, against our culture. This is not right.”\nI was seeing the whole scene from a bookstore, on the first story in a building just in front of the shop on the other side of the road. The greatest surprise was yet to come. When people had taken every valuable article from the shop... there was only an old grandfather clock left – very big, very antique. Seeing that people were leaving, the old man took that clock on his shoulders. It was difficult for him to carry because it was too heavy. I could not believe my eyes! He had been preventing people, and this was the last item in the shop.\nI had to come down from the bookstore and stop the priest. I said to him, “This is strange. The whole time you were shouting, ‘This is against our morality! This is against our religion, don’t do it!’ And now you are taking the biggest clock in the shop.”\nHe said, “I shouted enough, but nobody listened. And then finally the idea arose in me that I am simply shouting and wasting my time, and everybody else is getting something. So it is better to take this clock before somebody else gets it, because it was the only item left.”\nI asked, “But what happened to religion, morality, culture?”\nHe said this with an ashamed face – but he said it: “When nobody bothers about religion, culture and morality, why should I be the only victim? I am also part of the same crowd. I tried my best to convince them, but if nobody is going to follow the religious and the moral and the right way, then I am not going to be just a loser and look stupid standing there. Nobody even listened to me, nobody took any notice of me.” He carried that clock away.\nI have seen at least a dozen riots in that city, and I have asked individuals who have participated in arson, in murder, in rape, “Can you do it alone, on your own?” And they all said, without any exception, “On our own we could not do it. It was because so many people were doing it, and there was no responsibility left. We were not answerable, the crowd was answerable.”\nMan loses his small consciousness so easily into the collective ocean of unconsciousness. That is the cause of all wars, all riots, all crusades, all murders.\nIndividuals have committed very few crimes compared to the crowd. And the individuals who have committed crimes, their reasons are totally different – they are born with a criminal mind, they are born with a criminal chemistry, they need treatment. But the man who commits a crime because he is part of a crowd has nothing that needs to be treated.All that is needed is that he should be\ntaken out of the crowd. He should be cleaned – he should be cleaned from all bondages, from any kind of collectivity. He should be made an individual again – just as he had come into the world.\nThe crowds must disappear from the world. Only individuals should be left. Then individuals can have meetings, individuals can have communions, individuals can have dialogues. Right now, being part of a crowd, they are not free, not even conscious enough to have a dialogue or a communion.\nMy work is to take individuals out from any crowd, Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu, Jew; any political crowd, any racial crowd, any national crowd, Indian, Chinese, Japanese. I am against the crowd and absolutely for the individual, because only the individual can save the world. Only the individual can be the rebel and the new man, the foundation for the future humanity.\nThe teacher is asking three boys in her class, “What was your mother doing when you left for school this morning?”\n“Doing the washing,” says Tom. “Cleaning the bedroom,” says Dick.\n“Getting ready to go out and shoot ducks,” says Harry.\n“What! What are you talking about, Harry?” asked the teacher.\n“Well miss,” says Harry, “my dad has left home, and she threw her knickers on the fire and said she was going back to the game.”\nPeople are imitators. People are not acting on their own grounds; they are reacting. The husband has left her; that brings a reaction in her, a revenge – she is going back to the game. It is not an action out of consciousness, it is not an indication of individuality.\nThis is how the collective mind functions – always according to somebody else. Either for or against, it does not matter; either conformist or nonconformist, it does not matter. But it always is directed, motivated, dictated by others. Left to himself, he will find himself utterly lost – what to do?\nI am teaching my people to be meditators, to be people who can enjoy aloneness, to be people who can respect themselves without belonging to any crowd; who are not going to sell their souls for any awards and honors and respectability or prestige that the society can give to them. Their honor, their prestige and their power is within their own being – in their freedom, in their silence, in their love, in their creative action – not in their reaction. What others do is not determinative of their life.\nTheir life springs from within themselves. It has its own roots in the earth and its own branches in the sky. It has its own longing to reach to the stars.\nOnly such a man has beauty, grace. Only such a man has fulfilled the desire of existence to give him birth, to give him an opportunity. Those who remain part of the crowd have missed the train.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nTHE OTHER NIGHT DURING DARSHAN, LISTENING TO YOUR ANSWER TO NIVEDANO’S QUESTION, I HAD TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SEVEN YEARS I’VE BEEN WITH YOU, I COULD NOT ONLY INTELLECTUALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT REALLY FEEL THAT TO LOOK INSIDE ONESELF IS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THE REAL TREASURES OF LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I AM FEELING THIS SO STRONGLY, IT DOESN’T MAKE IT EASIER TO MEDITATE, TO LOOK INSIDE.\nIN THE PAST MY FAVORITE SUBJECT FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT HAS ALWAYS BEEN LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS. NOW, I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF HEARING YOU TALK\nABOUT MEDITATION. BELOVED MASTER, COULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK ABOUT VIPASSANA MEDITATION?\nPrem Sampurna, there are hundreds of methods of meditation, but perhaps vipassana has a unique status; just the same way as there have been thousands of mystics, but Gautam Buddha has a uniqueness of his own. In many ways he is incomparable, in many ways he has done more for humanity than anybody else. In many ways his search for truth was more sincere, more authentic than anybody else’s.\nWhy am I reminded of Gautam Buddha? I am reminded of Gautam Buddha because you have asked a question about vipassana meditation. That is the meditation through which Gautam Buddha became enlightened.\nThe very word vipassana in Pali, the language in which Gautam Buddha spoke... he was perfectly acquainted with Sanskrit; as a prince he was well educated in the highest literature of those days. But when he started speaking he never used Sanskrit because Sanskrit was the language of the intellectuals, of the brahmins, of the priests, not of the people.\nIt has never been a living language. It has a uniqueness among all the languages of the world – it has been spoken only by the learned, by the scholarly amongst themselves; and because of its unknowability, the masses have been mystified by it. Translated, it contains nothing special, and sometimes it contains nothing but bullshit, but it has a very musical sound.\nIts construction is the most perfect of any language in the world. It is very exhaustive – fifty-two letters in the alphabet, English has only twenty-six; it means the other twenty-six sounds are unavailable in English. Sanskrit is twice as rich because it can express all possible sounds, it has not left a single sound out of its alphabet. Subtle nuances have also been taken into account – sounds which are very difficult to pronounce, sounds which are rarely used by anyone, but which are possible to use, have been included.\nBut Gautam Buddha decided to speak in the language of the masses. It was a revolutionary step, because the languages of the masses are not grammatically right. Just by use, by ordinary people changing their tone, their sound, the words become easier; they are not complicated.\nWe have seen this happen to English in India. English was the language of the bureaucracy, of the people who were in power, of the British Empire. But a few words were bound to enter into the local people’s languages. And the transformation is worth seeing; it will explain to you the difference between a language which is really living, alive, because rough people use it... it has the quality of a wildflower, the quality of a forest, not of a well-clipped British garden.\nPeople have an uncanny sense to change words into their simplest form; for example, the English word ‘report’. Even the faraway villagers who don’t come in contact with educated people have to use that word – once in a while they have to go to the police station. But in the villages of India the word ‘report’ has become ‘rapat’. Report is a little difficult, rapat is more alive.\n‘Station’ is a word that is bound to be used by the people of the lowest education or no education. In Punjab it has become ‘satation’; in other parts it has become ‘teshan’, but nowhere is it ‘station’.\nPali is a language of the simple and in a way, innocent and ignorant people. Vipassana is their word. In Sanskrit it has its parallel, which the public has changed according to their convenience. In Sanskrit it is ‘vipashyana’ – that is a little difficult. But in Pali it is simply vipassana. The meaning is the same. The meaning – the literal meaning – of the word is ‘to look’, and the metaphorical meaning is ‘to watch, to witness’.\nGautam Buddha has chosen a meditation which can be called the essential meditation. All other meditations are different forms of witnessing, but witnessing is present in every kind of meditation as an essential part; it cannot be avoided. Buddha has deleted everything else and kept only the essential part – to witness.\nThere are three steps of witnessing – Buddha is a very scientific thinker. He begins with the body, because that is the easiest to witness. It is easy to witness my hand moving, my hand being raised. I can witness myself walking on the road, I can witness each step as I walk. I can witness while I am eating my food.\nSo the first step in vipassana is witnessing the actions of the body, which is the simplest step. Any scientific method will always begin from the simplest.\nAnd while witnessing the body, you will be amazed at the new experiences. When you move your hand with witnessing, watchfulness, alertness, consciousness, you will feel a certain grace and a certain silence in the hand. You can do the movement without witnessing; it will be quicker, but it will lose the grace.\nThe Buddha used to walk so slowly that many times he was asked why he was walking so slowly. He said, “This is part of my meditation: always to walk as if you are walking in winter into a cold stream... slowly, alert, because the stream is very cold; aware because the current is very strong; witnessing each of your steps because you can slip on the stones in the stream.”\nThe method remains the same, only the object changes with each step. The second step is watching the mind. Now you move into a more subtle world – watching your thoughts. If you have been successful in watching your body, there is not going to be any difficulty. Thoughts are subtle waves – electronic waves, radio waves – but they are as material as your body. They are not visible, just as the air is not visible, but the air is as material as the stones; so are your thoughts, material but invisible.\nThat is the second step, the middle step. You are moving towards invisibility, but still it is material... watching your thoughts. The only condition is, don’t judge. Don’t judge, because the moment you start judging you will forget watching.\nThere is no antagonism against judging. The reason it is prohibited is that the moment you start judging – “This is a good thought” – for that much space you were not witnessing. You started thinking, you became involved. You could not remain aloof, standing by the side of the road and just seeing the traffic.\nDon’t become a participant, either by appraising, valuing, condemning; no attitude should be taken about what is passing in your mind. You should watch your thoughts just as if clouds are passing in\nthe sky. You don’t make judgments about them – this black cloud is very evil, this white cloud looks like a sage. Clouds are clouds, they are neither evil nor good.\nSo are thoughts – just a small wavelength passing through your mind. Watch without any judgment and you are again in for a great surprise. As your watching becomes settled, thoughts will come less and less. The proportion is exactly the same: if you are fifty percent settled in your witnessing, then fifty percent of your thoughts will disappear. If you are sixty percent settled in your witnessing, then only forty percent of thoughts will be there. When you are ninety-nine percent a pure witness, only once in a while will there be a lonely thought – one percent, passing on the road – otherwise the traffic is gone. That rush-hour traffic is no longer there.\nWhen you are one hundred percent non-judgmental, just a witness, it means you have become just a mirror, because a mirror never makes any judgments. An ugly woman looks into it – the mirror has no judgment. A beautiful woman looks into the mirror, it makes no difference. Nobody looks into it... the mirror is as pure as when somebody is being reflected in it. Neither reflection stirs it, nor no-reflection. Witnessing becomes a mirror.\nThis is a great achievement in meditation. You have moved halfway, and this was the hardest part. Now you know the secret, and the same secret has just to be applied to different objects.\nFrom thoughts you have to move to more subtle experiences – emotions, feelings, moods... from the mind to the heart, with the same condition: no judgment, just witnessing. And the surprise will be that most of your emotions, feelings and moods which possess you...\nNow, when you are feeling sad, you become really sad, you are possessed by sadness. When you are feeling angry, it is not something partial. You become full of anger; every fiber of your being is throbbing with anger.\nWatching the heart, the experience will be that now nothing possesses you. Sadness comes and goes; you don’t become sad. Happiness comes and goes; you don’t become happy either. Whatever moves in the deep layers of your heart does not affect you at all. For the first time you taste something of mastery. You are no longer a slave to be pushed and pulled this way and that way, where any emotion, any feeling, anybody can disturb you for any trivia.\nIn my village, in my childhood, I had a doctor, Doctor Hiralal Gotrey. Nothing was wrong with the fellow; there was only one thing just a little strange, but it cannot be said to be wrong: his wife was very tall and he was very small. The difference must have been at least one foot. The whole village laughed; people enjoyed Doctor Gotrey going out with his wife. And, by chance, he had a compounder of medicines who was far more beautiful than him – younger, taller. He looked more like a doctor, and Gotrey looked like a compounder, as far as looks were concerned.\nI had an idea and it worked. I went to the compounder and said, “Doctor Sahib, where is your compounder?”\nThe compounder said, “What?”\nAnd the doctor became very angry: “What do you mean by addressing my compounder as doctor and asking him about the compounder?”\nI said, “I can’t do anything about it. The whole village thinks him to be the doctor. He looks like the doctor. You must be kidding.”\nHe said, “I am being very serious, and if you don’t listen I am going to come to meet your father.”\nI said, “You can come but please bring the doctor also, because then I can prove who is right.” At that very moment his wife came out. The wife and husband may have quarreled about something, because she supported me.\nShe said, “He is right; the compounder looks better than you. You are just a pygmy.” I said, “Listen, you were coming to see my father, and the doctor’s wife herself...” He said, “Stop! This is going too far. She is my wife!”\nI said, “You cannot befool the whole world.” Although the whole village had been a little curious, nobody had made it clear. I spread the news around the village that we had been in a misunderstanding: the little man who we used to think was the doctor is not the doctor, he is the compounder; and the big man who we used to think was the compounder is the doctor. And the wife belongs to the doctor not to the compounder.\nWhomsoever I said this to told me that this solved the whole problem. They said, “How do you know this?”\nI said, “I am coming directly from his dispensary.”\nFrom that day it became so troublesome that everybody would come to his dispensary and ask the doctor, “Compounder Sahib, where is the doctor?” And slowly slowly, he started becoming very angry. He started keeping a stick by his side, he started running behind people asking, “Why do you call me compounder?”\nThey said, “This is strange. You are the compounder – the whole village knows it.”\nAnd the compounder was also enjoying the whole game, so he used to remain quiet. He would not say anything – to say anything was dangerous. The doctor used to follow you with his stick, you had to run – although I knew all the small streets of the town, so I would give him a good run.\nHe would be shouting that I had to stop this: “This boy is destroying my practice. The whole day, rather than doing the practice, I am just chasing after people who are calling me compounder. And I have all the degrees of a doctor! And this boy is strange – he has even convinced my wife; even she laughs at me and says, ‘You are a compounder.’”\nRather than saying anything, I created a small symbol. But even that symbol used to work exactly. I would just keep two fingers up – one finger half, one full – and just pass on the street, not saying a single word. The moment he would see one finger down, one finger up, he would rush out with his stick, shouting, “I am coming!” Then even the other people in the neighborhood began saying, “Mr. Compounder, this is too much. That boy has not said anything. He is passing by in the street\ninnocently. And these are his fingers – whatever he wants to do, in whatever position he wants to keep them, he can keep them. It is no concern of yours.”\nAnd he would say, “It does concern me. It is not only a question of his fingers. Why should he always pass by with one finger up, another finger down, just in front of my door?”\nIt became known to all the boys of the city. His house was just in the middle of the city, so almost half of the schoolboys, nearly five hundred, used to pass in front of his house to the school; the school was on the other side. Five hundred boys in a line with one finger up and another finger down – and he would become mad. But he could not do anything.\nWe reported to the police station, “This man seems to be insane. He is a compounder and he thinks that he is a doctor, and it is none of his concern in what position we keep our fingers.”\nThe police inspector said, “Of course, it is nobody’s concern. And I was suspecting that guy is a compounder; he looks like a compounder. The other person looks like a doctor, well-dressed, young.” But his practice was completely finished.\nOne day he called me; I was passing by with my fingers up. He said, “Please come in.” I said, “Such a great difference, compounder Sahib?”\nHe somehow swallowed the anger, told me to sit on the chair. I said, “This is great. What is the matter?”\nHe said, “Listen, I am a poor man and you have destroyed my whole practice. Now no patient comes to me, and even if they come, they come to the compounder. It is so insulting that I cannot tolerate it.”\nI said, “I have not done anything. You have destroyed your practice yourself by being involved in a trivial thing. You could have remained unruffled. One fact is true – that you are small. Perhaps you are the doctor, but if you had not created so much fuss, things would have cooled down.”\nHe said, “Now you have to do something.”\nI said, “It is now almost impossible to convince the whole village that the compounder is really the doctor and to contradict myself – I cannot do that.”\nPeople become disturbed with absolute trivia, meaningless things. Somebody just passes by you, twitching his eye. He has not done anything. It is his eye; he has every right to twitch it. It is his constitutional right. Nobody can prevent anybody from twitching his eyes – but why do you get disturbed? And if he makes it a practice that whenever he sees you he twitches his eyes, you will start becoming enraged. Our consciousness is so small, it gets overpowered and possessed by anything – any mood, any feeling, any emotion.\nWhen you become a witness of the third step, you will become, for the first time, a master: nothing disturbs you, nothing overpowers you, everything remains far away, deep below, and you are on a hilltop.\nThese are the three steps of vipassana. Vipassana has many kinds of methods – this is only one method. Because Buddhism spread all over Eastern Asia, the Far East vipassana has a different structure. In Japan, it is watching the belly as you breathe in and out. That’s why the Japanese statues of Buddha have big bellies. No Indian statue of Buddha will have a big belly; that is unathletic, does not look beautiful.\nBut the Japanese Buddha has to have it, because the whole method of vipassana is to practice the belly coming up, not the chest. The chest remains silent, unmoving; only the belly goes up as you breathe in and the belly goes in as you breathe out. Watching it is a single-step vipassana prevalent in Japan.\nIn Ceylon there are two steps: first watching the same breathing, not at the belly point, but at the nose point. When you breathe in, the air touches your nostrils; be aware of it. And when the hot air goes out, be watchful. This is the first step.\nAnd the second step: when you breathe in, there is a gap before the breath returns – just a rest period, a few seconds. Watch those few seconds when the breath is not moving. If you become capable of watching those moments, you will be able to watch them outside also. When the breath goes out, before it comes in, there is a small interval – the same interval as inside. Watch that too, just be aware of it.\nIn Tibet they have a different way, in Korea another way, in China another way, but the essential point is to be a witness. And my feeling is that what I have described as three steps is the most easy, most simple – everybody can do it. It needs no scholarship, no austerity, no great understanding. And after these three steps comes the real experience. These three steps take you to the door of the temple, which is open.\nWhen you have become perfectly watchful of your body, mind and heart, then you cannot do anything more, then you have to wait. When perfection is complete on these three steps, the fourth step happens on its own accord as a reward. It is a quantum leap from the heart to the being, to the very center of your existence. You cannot do it; it happens – you have to remember that.\nDon’t try to do it, because if you try to do it your failure is absolutely certain. It is a happening. You prepare three steps, the fourth step is a reward from existence itself; it is a quantum leap. Suddenly your life force, your witnessing, enters into the very center of your being. You have come home.\nYou can call it self-realization, you can call it enlightenment, you can call it ultimate liberation, but there is nothing more than that. You have come to the very end in your search, you have found the very truth of existence and the great ecstasy that it brings as a shadow, by and around itself.\nThe Jew and the Irishman are arguing about sex. The Irishman says that, according to his priest, sex is work and solely for the purpose of procreation.\n“No,” says the Jew, “my rabbi says sex is pleasure. If it was work we would let the Irish do it.” Meditation is not work.\nMeditation is purest blissfulness.\nAs you go deeper, you come across more and more beautiful spaces, more and more luminous spots. They are your treasure... deeper and deeper silences, which are not only the absence of noise, but the presence of a soundless song – musical, alive and dancing.\nAs you reach to the ultimate point of your being, the center of the cyclone, you have found god; not as a person, but as light, as consciousness, as truth, as beauty – as all that man has been dreaming of for centuries. And those dreamed-of treasures are hidden within himself.\nIt is not a troublesome, torturous, ascetic practice; it is very pleasant, musical, poetic, and it goes on becoming more and more of a sheer joy. It is not work, it is prayer – the only prayer I know of. To me prayer means: when you have achieved your being, you feel a tremendous gratitude towards existence. That gratitude is the only real, authentic prayer; all other prayers are fake, pseudo, manufactured. This gratitude will arise within you just like a fragrance arising out of roses.\nIt is good that you are dropping your childish questions about boyfriend, girlfriend, your so-called relationships; you don’t know yourself and you have started relating with another!\nIt is good that you are asking about meditation. That will not only bring transformation to you, it will also bring transformation to your relationships. It will also bring an authentic overflow of love, and only then will you be able to see that what you used to call love was not love; it was simply lust, biological lust, based on your hormones. Only a meditator knows a love that is not biological, that comes as a spiritual abundance, with a great urge to share – because the more you share it, the more you have it.\nA Jewish swami, Goldstein, takes a gorgeous ma out to dinner. They go to the most expensive restaurant in Poona and feast on Italian spaghetti, Japanese sushi and French wine. For dessert they choose German chocolate cake and finish with Brazilian coffee.\nWhen the waiter brings them the bill, Goldstein finds he has left his wallet at home. So he takes out his picture of Rajneesh and hands it to the waiter.\n“What is this?” demands the waiter. “My mastercard,” replies Goldstein. Meditation is your mastercard!\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6165","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebel/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebel/>The Rebel</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 The solitary lion and his tremendously beautiful roar</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6165 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Rebel/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

CREW SUCH AS WE? ACTUALLY, I DON’T REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>JUST, PLEASE, DON’T STOP DOING IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, every crowd is a motley crowd, but no individual is motley.
Every individual is an authentic consciousness. The moment he becomes a
part of the crowd, he loses his consciousness; then he is dominated by
the collective, mechanical mind.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me what I am doing? I am doing a simple thing –
bringing out individuals from the motley crowds, giving them their
individuality and dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want any crowds in the world. Whether they have gathered in
the name of religion, or in the name of nationality, or in the name of
race, it does not matter. The crowd as such is ugly, and the crowd has
committed the greatest crimes in the world, because the crowd has no
consciousness. It is a collective unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciousness makes one an individual – a solitary pine tree dancing
in the wind, a solitary sunlit mountain peak in its utter glory and
beauty, a solitary lion and his tremendously beautiful roar that goes on
echoing for miles in the valleys.</p><p><br></p><p>161</p><p>The crowd is always of sheep; and all the efforts of the past have
been to convert every individual into a cog in the wheel, into a dead
part of a dead crowd. The more unconscious he is and the more his
behavior is dominated by the collectivity, the less dangerous he is. In
fact, he becomes almost harmless. He cannot destroy even his own
slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, he starts glorifying his own slavery – his religion,
his nation, his race, his color. These are his slaveries, but he starts
glorifying them. As an individual he belongs to no crowd. Every child is
born as an individual, but rarely does a man die as an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>My work is to help you meet your death with the same innocence, with
the same integrity, with the same individuality as you have met your
birth.</p><p><br></p><p>Between your birth and your death your dance should remain a
conscious, solitary reaching to the stars; alone, uncompromising – a
rebellious spirit. Unless you have a rebellious spirit, you don’t have a
spirit at all. There is no other kind of spirit available.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can rest assured that I am not going to stop! That’s my only
joy – to make as many people as possible free from their bondages, dark
cells, their handcuffs, their chains; to bring them into light, so they
can also know the beauties of this planet, the beauty of this sky, the
beauties of this existence. Other than that, there is no God, and no
God’s temple.</p><p><br></p><p>In freedom you can enter the temple. In a collectivity, in a crowd,
you simply go on clinging to the corpses of the past. A man living
according to the crowd has stopped living. He is simply following like a
robot.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps robots are also a little bit more individual than the
so-called individual in the crowd... because just now in Japan there are
one hundred thousand robots – mechanical men – working in the factories.
Suddenly, within these two months, a strange phenomenon is happening.
The government is worried, the scientists are worried, and they have not
been able to find any explanation. Up to now the robots have been
working silently; nobody had ever thought that they would suddenly start
a rebellion. But ten people have been killed within two months.</p><p><br></p><p>A robot is working – and a robot works according to a computer,
according to a pre-programmed plan; he cannot go in any way that is
different from the program that has been fed into it. But, strangely
enough, these ten robots suddenly stopped working, got hold of some man
who was around, and just killed him. The figure of ten men being killed
is from the government – it cannot be true. No government speaks the
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>My own experience is that it is always good to multiply all the
figures given by the government by at least ten. If they are saying ten
persons have died, one hundred persons must have died, or more. They are
trying to pacify the masses – “Don’t be worried, we will find what went
wrong.” But they have no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, any act that is not programmed into the computer, the robot
is not capable of doing – and these were not the programs. The robots
showed some sign of freedom, they showed some sign of individuality,
some indication of rebellion.</p><p>Computers cannot answer any new questions. They can answer only
questions for which information has already been given to them.
Naturally they don’t have any intelligence, they have only a memory
system, a filing system which records. Of course, they are perfect in
their efficiency. No man can be that perfect, once in a while you
forget. And it is absolutely necessary, for life to go on, to forget
most of the unnecessary things that are happening every day – otherwise
your memory system will be too loaded. But the computer is a mechanism.
You cannot load it too much, it has no life.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard... a man was asking a computer, “Can you tell me where
my father is?” He was just joking with the scientist who was working on
that great computer, and the computer said, “Your father? He went
fishing just three hours ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed and said to the scientist, “You are creating a stupid
computer. My father has been dead for three years.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was shocked that the computer laughed – for which it was never
programmed – and said, “Don’t be gullible. It was not your father who
died three years ago, it was only the husband of your mother. Your
father has gone fishing three hours ago; you can go to the beach and you
will meet him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right now this is only a story, but looking at the actual facts
happening in Japan, the story takes on a certain reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But man in the crowd has always behaved blindly. If you pull the same
man out of the crowd and ask him, “What were you doing? Can you do it
alone, on your own?” he will feel embarrassed. And you will be surprised
to hear his answer: “On my own I cannot do such a stupid thing, but when
I am in a crowd something strange happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>For twenty years I lived in a city which was proportionately divided,
half and half, into Hindus and Mohammedans. They were equally powerful,
and almost every year riots happened. I used to know a professor in the
university where I was teaching. I could never have dreamed that this
man could put fire to a Hindu temple; he was such a gentleman – nice,
well educated, well cultured. When there was a riot between the Hindus
and the Mohammedans I was watching, standing by the roadside.
Mohammedans were burning a Hindu temple, Hindus were burning a
Mohammedan mosque.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw this professor engaged in burning the Hindu temple. I pulled
him out and I asked, “Professor Farid, what are you doing?”.</p><p><br></p><p>He became very embarrassed. He said, “I’m sorry, I got lost in the
crowd. Because everybody else was doing it, I forgot my own
responsibility – everybody else was responsible. I felt for the first
time a tremendous freedom from responsibility. Nobody can blame me. It
was a Mohammedan crowd, and I was just part of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>On another occasion, a Mohammedan’s watch shop was being looted. It
was the most precious collection of watches. An old Hindu priest... The
people who were taking away those watches and destroying the shop – they
had killed the shop owner – were all Hindus. An old priest I was
acquainted with was standing on the steps and shouting very angrily at
the people, “What are you doing? This is against our religion, against
our morality, against our culture. This is not right.”</p><p>I was seeing the whole scene from a bookstore, on the first story in
a building just in front of the shop on the other side of the road. The
greatest surprise was yet to come. When people had taken every valuable
article from the shop... there was only an old grandfather clock left –
very big, very antique. Seeing that people were leaving, the old man
took that clock on his shoulders. It was difficult for him to carry
because it was too heavy. I could not believe my eyes! He had been
preventing people, and this was the last item in the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to come down from the bookstore and stop the priest. I said to
him, “This is strange. The whole time you were shouting, ‘This is
against our morality! This is against our religion, don’t do it!’ And
now you are taking the biggest clock in the shop.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I shouted enough, but nobody listened. And then finally the
idea arose in me that I am simply shouting and wasting my time, and
everybody else is getting something. So it is better to take this clock
before somebody else gets it, because it was the only item left.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked, “But what happened to religion, morality, culture?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said this with an ashamed face – but he said it: “When nobody
bothers about religion, culture and morality, why should I be the only
victim? I am also part of the same crowd. I tried my best to convince
them, but if nobody is going to follow the religious and the moral and
the right way, then I am not going to be just a loser and look stupid
standing there. Nobody even listened to me, nobody took any notice of
me.” He carried that clock away.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen at least a dozen riots in that city, and I have asked
individuals who have participated in arson, in murder, in rape, “Can you
do it alone, on your own?” And they all said, without any exception, “On
our own we could not do it. It was because so many people were doing it,
and there was no responsibility left. We were not answerable, the crowd
was answerable.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man loses his small consciousness so easily into the collective ocean
of unconsciousness. That is the cause of all wars, all riots, all
crusades, all murders.</p><p><br></p><p>Individuals have committed very few crimes compared to the crowd. And
the individuals who have committed crimes, their reasons are totally
different – they are born with a criminal mind, they are born with a
criminal chemistry, they need treatment. But the man who commits a crime
because he is part of a crowd has nothing that needs to be treated.<span class=s4></span>All that is needed is that he should be</p><p>taken out of the crowd. He should be cleaned – he should be cleaned
from all bondages, from any kind of collectivity. He should be made an
individual again – just as he had come into the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowds must disappear from the world. Only individuals should be
left. Then individuals can have meetings, individuals can have
communions, individuals can have dialogues. Right now, being part of a
crowd, they are not free, not even conscious enough to have a dialogue
or a communion.</p><p><br></p><p>My work is to take individuals out from any crowd, Christian,
Mohammedan, Hindu, Jew; any political crowd, any racial crowd, any
national crowd, Indian, Chinese, Japanese. I am against the crowd and
absolutely for the individual, because only the individual can save the
world. Only the individual can be the rebel and the new man, the
foundation for the future humanity.</p><p>The teacher is asking three boys in her class, “What was your mother
doing when you left for school this morning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Doing the washing,” says Tom. “Cleaning the bedroom,” says Dick.</p><p>“Getting ready to go out and shoot ducks,” says Harry.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What are you talking about, Harry?” asked the teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well miss,” says Harry, “my dad has left home, and she threw her
knickers on the fire and said she was going back to the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>People are imitators. People are not acting on their own grounds;
they are reacting. The husband has left her; that brings a reaction in
her, a revenge – she is going back to the game. It is not an action out
of consciousness, it is not an indication of individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how the collective mind functions – always according to
somebody else. Either for or against, it does not matter; either
conformist or nonconformist, it does not matter. But it always is
directed, motivated, dictated by others. Left to himself, he will find
himself utterly lost – what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>I am teaching my people to be meditators, to be people who can enjoy
aloneness, to be people who can respect themselves without belonging to
any crowd; who are not going to sell their souls for any awards and
honors and respectability or prestige that the society can give to them.
Their honor, their prestige and their power is within their own being –
in their freedom, in their silence, in their love, in their creative
action – not in their reaction. What others do is not determinative of
their life.</p><p><br></p><p>Their life springs from within themselves. It has its own roots in
the earth and its own branches in the sky. It has its own longing to
reach to the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Only such a man has beauty, grace. Only such a man has fulfilled the
desire of existence to give him birth, to give him an opportunity. Those
who remain part of the crowd have missed the train.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT DURING DARSHAN, LISTENING TO YOUR ANSWER TO
NIVEDANO’S QUESTION, I HAD TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE. FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN THE SEVEN YEARS I’VE BEEN WITH YOU, I COULD NOT ONLY
INTELLECTUALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT REALLY FEEL THAT TO LOOK INSIDE ONESELF
IS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THE REAL TREASURES OF LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I AM
FEELING THIS SO STRONGLY, IT DOESN’T MAKE IT EASIER TO MEDITATE, TO LOOK
INSIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE PAST MY FAVORITE SUBJECT FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS. NOW, I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF HEARING YOU TALK</p><p>ABOUT MEDITATION. BELOVED MASTER, COULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK ABOUT
VIPASSANA MEDITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Sampurna, there are hundreds of methods of meditation, but
perhaps vipassana has a unique status; just the same way as there have
been thousands of mystics, but Gautam Buddha has a uniqueness of his
own. In many ways he is incomparable, in many ways he has done more for
humanity than anybody else. In many ways his search for truth was more
sincere, more authentic than anybody else’s.</p><p><br></p><p>Why am I reminded of Gautam Buddha? I am reminded of Gautam Buddha
because you have asked a question about vipassana meditation. That is
the meditation through which Gautam Buddha became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word vipassana in Pali, the language in which Gautam Buddha
spoke... he was perfectly acquainted with Sanskrit; as a prince he was
well educated in the highest literature of those days. But when he
started speaking he never used Sanskrit because Sanskrit was the
language of the intellectuals, of the brahmins, of the priests, not of
the people.</p><p><br></p><p>It has never been a living language. It has a uniqueness among all
the languages of the world – it has been spoken only by the learned, by
the scholarly amongst themselves; and because of its unknowability, the
masses have been mystified by it. Translated, it contains nothing
special, and sometimes it contains nothing but bullshit, but it has a
very musical sound.</p><p><br></p><p>Its construction is the most perfect of any language in the world. It
is very exhaustive – fifty-two letters in the alphabet, English has only
twenty-six; it means the other twenty-six sounds are unavailable in
English. Sanskrit is twice as rich because it can express all possible
sounds, it has not left a single sound out of its alphabet. Subtle
nuances have also been taken into account – sounds which are very
difficult to pronounce, sounds which are rarely used by anyone, but
which are possible to use, have been included.</p><p><br></p><p>But Gautam Buddha decided to speak in the language of the masses. It
was a revolutionary step, because the languages of the masses are not
grammatically right. Just by use, by ordinary people changing their
tone, their sound, the words become easier; they are not
complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>We have seen this happen to English in India. English was the
language of the bureaucracy, of the people who were in power, of the
British Empire. But a few words were bound to enter into the local
people’s languages. And the transformation is worth seeing; it will
explain to you the difference between a language which is really living,
alive, because rough people use it... it has the quality of a
wildflower, the quality of a forest, not of a well-clipped British
garden.</p><p><br></p><p>People have an uncanny sense to change words into their simplest
form; for example, the English word ‘report’. Even the faraway villagers
who don’t come in contact with educated people have to use that word –
once in a while they have to go to the police station. But in the
villages of India the word ‘report’ has become ‘rapat’. Report is a
little difficult, rapat is more alive.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Station’ is a word that is bound to be used by the people of the
lowest education or no education. In Punjab it has become ‘satation’; in
other parts it has become ‘teshan’, but nowhere is it ‘station’.</p><p>Pali is a language of the simple and in a way, innocent and ignorant
people. Vipassana is their word. In Sanskrit it has its parallel, which
the public has changed according to their convenience. In Sanskrit it is
‘vipashyana’ – that is a little difficult. But in Pali it is simply
vipassana. The meaning is the same. The meaning – the literal meaning –
of the word is ‘to look’, and the metaphorical meaning is ‘to watch, to
witness’.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha has chosen a meditation which can be called the
essential meditation. All other meditations are different forms of
witnessing, but witnessing is present in every kind of meditation as an
essential part; it cannot be avoided. Buddha has deleted everything else
and kept only the essential part – to witness.</p><p><br></p><p>There are three steps of witnessing – Buddha is a very scientific
thinker. He begins with the body, because that is the easiest to
witness. It is easy to witness my hand moving, my hand being raised. I
can witness myself walking on the road, I can witness each step as I
walk. I can witness while I am eating my food.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first step in vipassana is witnessing the actions of the body,
which is the simplest step. Any scientific method will always begin from
the simplest.</p><p><br></p><p>And while witnessing the body, you will be amazed at the new
experiences. When you move your hand with witnessing, watchfulness,
alertness, consciousness, you will feel a certain grace and a certain
silence in the hand. You can do the movement without witnessing; it will
be quicker, but it will lose the grace.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buddha used to walk so slowly that many times he was asked why he
was walking so slowly. He said, “This is part of my meditation: always
to walk as if you are walking in winter into a cold stream... slowly,
alert, because the stream is very cold; aware because the current is
very strong; witnessing each of your steps because you can slip on the
stones in the stream.”</p><p><br></p><p>The method remains the same, only the object changes with each step.
The second step is watching the mind. Now you move into a more subtle
world – watching your thoughts. If you have been successful in watching
your body, there is not going to be any difficulty. Thoughts are subtle
waves – electronic waves, radio waves – but they are as material as your
body. They are not visible, just as the air is not visible, but the air
is as material as the stones; so are your thoughts, material but
invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the second step, the middle step. You are moving towards
invisibility, but still it is material... watching your thoughts. The
only condition is, don’t judge. Don’t judge, because the moment you
start judging you will forget watching.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no antagonism against judging. The reason it is prohibited
is that the moment you start judging – “This is a good thought” – for
that much space you were not witnessing. You started thinking, you
became involved. You could not remain aloof, standing by the side of the
road and just seeing the traffic.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t become a participant, either by appraising, valuing,
condemning; no attitude should be taken about what is passing in your
mind. You should watch your thoughts just as if clouds are passing
in</p><p>the sky. You don’t make judgments about them – this black cloud is
very evil, this white cloud looks like a sage. Clouds are clouds, they
are neither evil nor good.</p><p><br></p><p>So are thoughts – just a small wavelength passing through your mind.
Watch without any judgment and you are again in for a great surprise. As
your watching becomes settled, thoughts will come less and less. The
proportion is exactly the same: if you are fifty percent settled in your
witnessing, then fifty percent of your thoughts will disappear. If you
are sixty percent settled in your witnessing, then only forty percent of
thoughts will be there. When you are ninety-nine percent a pure witness,
only once in a while will there be a lonely thought – one percent,
passing on the road – otherwise the traffic is gone. That rush-hour
traffic is no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are one hundred percent non-judgmental, just a witness, it
means you have become just a mirror, because a mirror never makes any
judgments. An ugly woman looks into it – the mirror has no judgment. A
beautiful woman looks into the mirror, it makes no difference. Nobody
looks into it... the mirror is as pure as when somebody is being
reflected in it. Neither reflection stirs it, nor no-reflection.
Witnessing becomes a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a great achievement in meditation. You have moved halfway,
and this was the hardest part. Now you know the secret, and the same
secret has just to be applied to different objects.</p><p><br></p><p>From thoughts you have to move to more subtle experiences – emotions,
feelings, moods... from the mind to the heart, with the same condition:
no judgment, just witnessing. And the surprise will be that most of your
emotions, feelings and moods which possess you...</p><p><br></p><p>Now, when you are feeling sad, you become really sad, you are
possessed by sadness. When you are feeling angry, it is not something
partial. You become full of anger; every fiber of your being is
throbbing with anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Watching the heart, the experience will be that now nothing possesses
you. Sadness comes and goes; you don’t become sad. Happiness comes and
goes; you don’t become happy either. Whatever moves in the deep layers
of your heart does not affect you at all. For the first time you taste
something of mastery. You are no longer a slave to be pushed and pulled
this way and that way, where any emotion, any feeling, anybody can
disturb you for any trivia.</p><p><br></p><p>In my village, in my childhood, I had a doctor, Doctor Hiralal
Gotrey. Nothing was wrong with the fellow; there was only one thing just
a little strange, but it cannot be said to be wrong: his wife was very
tall and he was very small. The difference must have been at least one
foot. The whole village laughed; people enjoyed Doctor Gotrey going out
with his wife. And, by chance, he had a compounder of medicines who was
far more beautiful than him – younger, taller. He looked more like a
doctor, and Gotrey looked like a compounder, as far as looks were
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>I had an idea and it worked. I went to the compounder and said,
“Doctor Sahib, where is your compounder?”</p><p><br></p><p>The compounder said, “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the doctor became very angry: “What do you mean by addressing my
compounder as doctor and asking him about the compounder?”</p><p>I said, “I can’t do anything about it. The whole village thinks him
to be the doctor. He looks like the doctor. You must be kidding.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am being very serious, and if you don’t listen I am going
to come to meet your father.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can come but please bring the doctor also, because then
I can prove who is right.” At that very moment his wife came out. The
wife and husband may have quarreled about something, because she
supported me.</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “He is right; the compounder looks better than you. You are
just a pygmy.” I said, “Listen, you were coming to see my father, and
the doctor’s wife herself...” He said, “Stop! This is going too far. She
is my wife!”</p><p>I said, “You cannot befool the whole world.” Although the whole
village had been a little curious, nobody had made it clear. I spread
the news around the village that we had been in a misunderstanding: the
little man who we used to think was the doctor is not the doctor, he is
the compounder; and the big man who we used to think was the compounder
is the doctor. And the wife belongs to the doctor not to the
compounder.</p><p><br></p><p>Whomsoever I said this to told me that this solved the whole problem.
They said, “How do you know this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am coming directly from his dispensary.”</p><p><br></p><p>From that day it became so troublesome that everybody would come to
his dispensary and ask the doctor, “Compounder Sahib, where is the
doctor?” And slowly slowly, he started becoming very angry. He started
keeping a stick by his side, he started running behind people asking,
“Why do you call me compounder?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is strange. You are the compounder – the whole
village knows it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the compounder was also enjoying the whole game, so he used to
remain quiet. He would not say anything – to say anything was dangerous.
The doctor used to follow you with his stick, you had to run – although
I knew all the small streets of the town, so I would give him a good
run.</p><p><br></p><p>He would be shouting that I had to stop this: “This boy is destroying
my practice. The whole day, rather than doing the practice, I am just
chasing after people who are calling me compounder. And I have all the
degrees of a doctor! And this boy is strange – he has even convinced my
wife; even she laughs at me and says, ‘You are a compounder.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than saying anything, I created a small symbol. But even that
symbol used to work exactly. I would just keep two fingers up – one
finger half, one full – and just pass on the street, not saying a single
word. The moment he would see one finger down, one finger up, he would
rush out with his stick, shouting, “I am coming!” Then even the other
people in the neighborhood began saying, “Mr. Compounder, this is too
much. That boy has not said anything. He is passing by in the street</p><p>innocently. And these are his fingers – whatever he wants to do, in
whatever position he wants to keep them, he can keep them. It is no
concern of yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would say, “It does concern me. It is not only a question of
his fingers. Why should he always pass by with one finger up, another
finger down, just in front of my door?”</p><p><br></p><p>It became known to all the boys of the city. His house was just in
the middle of the city, so almost half of the schoolboys, nearly five
hundred, used to pass in front of his house to the school; the school
was on the other side. Five hundred boys in a line with one finger up
and another finger down – and he would become mad. But he could not do
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>We reported to the police station, “This man seems to be insane. He
is a compounder and he thinks that he is a doctor, and it is none of his
concern in what position we keep our fingers.”</p><p><br></p><p>The police inspector said, “Of course, it is nobody’s concern. And I
was suspecting that guy is a compounder; he looks like a compounder. The
other person looks like a doctor, well-dressed, young.” But his practice
was completely finished.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he called me; I was passing by with my fingers up. He said,
“Please come in.” I said, “Such a great difference, compounder
Sahib?”</p><p>He somehow swallowed the anger, told me to sit on the chair. I said,
“This is great. What is the matter?”</p><p>He said, “Listen, I am a poor man and you have destroyed my whole
practice. Now no patient comes to me, and even if they come, they come
to the compounder. It is so insulting that I cannot tolerate it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have not done anything. You have destroyed your practice
yourself by being involved in a trivial thing. You could have remained
unruffled. One fact is true – that you are small. Perhaps you are the
doctor, but if you had not created so much fuss, things would have
cooled down.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Now you have to do something.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is now almost impossible to convince the whole village
that the compounder is really the doctor and to contradict myself – I
cannot do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>People become disturbed with absolute trivia, meaningless things.
Somebody just passes by you, twitching his eye. He has not done
anything. It is his eye; he has every right to twitch it. It is his
constitutional right. Nobody can prevent anybody from twitching his eyes
– but why do you get disturbed? And if he makes it a practice that
whenever he sees you he twitches his eyes, you will start becoming
enraged. Our consciousness is so small, it gets overpowered and
possessed by anything – any mood, any feeling, any emotion.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become a witness of the third step, you will become, for the
first time, a master: nothing disturbs you, nothing overpowers you,
everything remains far away, deep below, and you are on a hilltop.</p><p>These are the three steps of vipassana. Vipassana has many kinds of
methods – this is only one method. Because Buddhism spread all over
Eastern Asia, the Far East vipassana has a different structure. In
Japan, it is watching the belly as you breathe in and out. That’s why
the Japanese statues of Buddha have big bellies. No Indian statue of
Buddha will have a big belly; that is unathletic, does not look
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Japanese Buddha has to have it, because the whole method of
vipassana is to practice the belly coming up, not the chest. The chest
remains silent, unmoving; only the belly goes up as you breathe in and
the belly goes in as you breathe out. Watching it is a single-step
vipassana prevalent in Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>In Ceylon there are two steps: first watching the same breathing, not
at the belly point, but at the nose point. When you breathe in, the air
touches your nostrils; be aware of it. And when the hot air goes out, be
watchful. This is the first step.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second step: when you breathe in, there is a gap before the
breath returns – just a rest period, a few seconds. Watch those few
seconds when the breath is not moving. If you become capable of watching
those moments, you will be able to watch them outside also. When the
breath goes out, before it comes in, there is a small interval – the
same interval as inside. Watch that too, just be aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>In Tibet they have a different way, in Korea another way, in China
another way, but the essential point is to be a witness. And my feeling
is that what I have described as three steps is the most easy, most
simple – everybody can do it. It needs no scholarship, no austerity, no
great understanding. And after these three steps comes the real
experience. These three steps take you to the door of the temple, which
is open.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have become perfectly watchful of your body, mind and heart,
then you cannot do anything more, then you have to wait. When perfection
is complete on these three steps, the fourth step happens on its own
accord as a reward. It is a quantum leap from the heart to the being, to
the very center of your existence. You cannot do it; it happens – you
have to remember that.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t try to do it, because if you try to do it your failure is
absolutely certain. It is a happening. You prepare three steps, the
fourth step is a reward from existence itself; it is a quantum leap.
Suddenly your life force, your witnessing, enters into the very center
of your being. You have come home.</p><p><br></p><p>You can call it self-realization, you can call it enlightenment, you
can call it ultimate liberation, but there is nothing more than that.
You have come to the very end in your search, you have found the very
truth of existence and the great ecstasy that it brings as a shadow, by
and around itself.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jew and the Irishman are arguing about sex. The Irishman says
that, according to his priest, sex is work and solely for the purpose of
procreation.</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” says the Jew, “my rabbi says sex is pleasure. If it was work we
would let the Irish do it.” Meditation is not work.</p><p>Meditation is purest blissfulness.</p><p>As you go deeper, you come across more and more beautiful spaces,
more and more luminous spots. They are your treasure... deeper and
deeper silences, which are not only the absence of noise, but the
presence of a soundless song – musical, alive and dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>As you reach to the ultimate point of your being, the center of the
cyclone, you have found god; not as a person, but as light, as
consciousness, as truth, as beauty – as all that man has been dreaming
of for centuries. And those dreamed-of treasures are hidden within
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a troublesome, torturous, ascetic practice; it is very
pleasant, musical, poetic, and it goes on becoming more and more of a
sheer joy. It is not work, it is prayer – the only prayer I know of. To
me prayer means: when you have achieved your being, you feel a
tremendous gratitude towards existence. That gratitude is the only real,
authentic prayer; all other prayers are fake, pseudo, manufactured. This
gratitude will arise within you just like a fragrance arising out of
roses.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you are dropping your childish questions about
boyfriend, girlfriend, your so-called relationships; you don’t know
yourself and you have started relating with another!</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you are asking about meditation. That will not only
bring transformation to you, it will also bring transformation to your
relationships. It will also bring an authentic overflow of love, and
only then will you be able to see that what you used to call love was
not love; it was simply lust, biological lust, based on your hormones.
Only a meditator knows a love that is not biological, that comes as a
spiritual abundance, with a great urge to share – because the more you
share it, the more you have it.</p><p><br></p><p>A Jewish swami, Goldstein, takes a gorgeous ma out to dinner. They go

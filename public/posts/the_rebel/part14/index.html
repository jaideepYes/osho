FOR YEARS I HAVE LOVED STORIES OF GURDJIEFF AND ZEN MASTERS WHO HIT THEIR DISCIPLES SO HARD THAT THEY GET IT.\nTHE OTHER NIGHT YOU STRUCK YOUR SCALPEL SHARP – NO ANESTHETIC – REMOVING A CANCER THAT’S BEEN THERE FOR LIVES. IT HURT, BUT THE PATIENT FEELS HEALTHIER AND EVEN LONGS WITH A PASSION TO EXPOSE MORE AND MORE. PART OF ME SAYS, “NO, THIS IS JUST GREED AND EXHIBITIONISM.” IS THERE A RIGHT WAY TO EXPOSE ONESELF TO A MASTER?\nIndivar, learn not to listen to your mind, it always leads you astray. Its advice is always categorically poisonous. Rise above your mind; only from that height can you see clearly. To be in the mind is to be in the clouds. Just a little higher and the sky is clean; you can see the farthest stars.\nYour heart was understanding absolutely and exactly what the situation was. Immediately your mind started interfering and saying, “No, this is just greed and exhibitionism.” It is neither greed nor exhibitionism, because both are part of the ego. And I have not hit you, but the ego which is pretending to be you. It will try to protect itself in every way. But once you start understanding the language of the heart, the subtle nuances of your innermost being, the ego becomes powerless, loses its domination over you.\nYou are asking, “Is there a right way to expose oneself to a master?” Every way is right as far as exposing yourself is concerned. Expose in any way – but expose! Open your windows and doors, become vulnerable. All ways of opening are right, and all ways of closing yourself are wrong. There is no right way of closing, and there is no wrong way of exposing.\nI have heard that you went to every person who had been bowing down his head in love, in trust and gratitude, and offered your apology. That makes you an authentic sannyasin. Any pseudo-sannyasin would have escaped and started creating lies and rumors and allegations against me. But instead of doing that, you went to sannyasins to offer your apology.\nYou proved your mettle, you proved your dignity, you proved your understanding; and you proved that you are courageous enough to be humble, courageous enough to put your ego aside. Now let this incident not become just a memory, a faraway remembrance. Let this become your moment to moment understanding, becoming deeper, becoming clearer. And it will bring you immense blessings.\nJust a little bit of understanding can bring a tremendous revolution in your life. All seeds are small – the trees may grow high, almost touching the stars, but the seeds are very small. This is just a seed that has fallen into your heart; now allow it to grow. Give nourishment to it, support it, remove all hindrances in its path; and a small seed, which seems to be nothing special in this moment, may bring thousands of flowers.\nJust a little waiting, just a little patience for the spring to come... it always comes. We miss it if we don’t have any seeds in our heart – spring comes and goes, nothing blossoms in us. If we have seeds in our heart, then the coming of the spring is understood by every cell and fiber of our being, and the blossoming of our potential becomes a reality forever. The inner spring only comes – it never goes.\n“Dear Mother,” wrote Paddy to his old, old mother. “I am sending some pills that a witch doctor gave me, and if you take one it will take years off your life.”\nPaddy came home a few weeks later, and there was a beautiful young woman outside his house, rocking a pram in which a baby lay sucking a bottle. “Where is my mother?” asked Paddy.\n“Don’t be silly,” said the woman, “I am your mother. And those pills were marvelous.” “Imagine that,” said Paddy. “Only one pill – and what is more, you were able to have a baby.” “Are you crazy?” cried the woman. “That is not a baby. That is your father. He took two.”\nGreed can be dangerous; but there has been no greed, only a misunderstanding. There has not really been greed or exhibitionism. But mind will always use that strategy: whenever you are moving in the right way, the mind will suggest that something is wrong. And the strangest thing about mind is, when you are going wrong it will remain silent; it will not say anything at all. Take it as a criterion: when mind says that something is wrong, do it. When mind says something is right, don’t do it. That’s how one gets free from the fetters of the mind.\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED MASTER,\nPLEASE EXPOSE ME. IS THIS WHAT ZARATHUSTRA CALLS “THE CRUEL HONESTY”? IS SINCERITY A HIGH VALUE IN LIFE? BELOVED MASTER, DID I GET THE JOKE? CAN YOU GIVE ME THE RIGHT NUMBER TO PHONE? DO I NEED TO BE SENT TO GOA, OR CAN YOU AND THIS BEAUTIFUL COMMUNE FORGIVE ME, SO I CAN START AFRESH?\nDhyan Om, it is not what Zarathustra calls “The cruel honesty,” it is a very mild form. But if you insist on being a nut, I may have to use cruel honesty too. But your nut has to be broken.\nYou are asking, “Is sincerity a high value in life?” It is the highest value in life. A life which is not sincere is not worth living at all. A life which is not sincere is fake – it is pseudo; you are playing a role in which your heart is absent, you are saying things which you don’t mean. You are living as if on somebody else’s behalf. And you call it life! Sincerity and life are synonymous.\nYou are also asking me, “Did I get the joke? Can you give me the right number to phone? Do I need to be sent to Goa, or can you and this beautiful commune forgive me, so I can start afresh?”\nThe first thing – you could not get the joke, neither could Latifa get it. You were both discussing it and you could not come to a conclusion about what it means.\nI had told you beforehand that Latifa will not get it – that is her German heritage. If she were capable of getting the joke she would not be with you either. The very fact that she is with you is enough proof that she is also a hard German – you may be a hard coconut, it does not matter.\nThere is no need to be worried about the joke. Just start listening more attentively. One misses a joke only when one is not listening attentively, because the moment of understanding a joke is a very small moment. You may have heard the whole joke, but just before the punch line there is a small turning. The turning is so small, delicate and subtle, that if you miss it you cannot connect the punch line with the rest of the joke that you have heard – and then you are at a loss.\nA joke is a beautiful method to check on your awareness – whether you are simply hearing, or listening too. There is no need to have a phone number. I can give you the right phone number – even to God – but there is no need to bother anybody.\nJust listen to the tape again or see the video again. However hard a coconut you may be, there must be some juice inside. You will get it. And it is one of the mysteries of jokes that they cannot be explained – once you explain a joke, it is no longer a joke. Its whole beauty lies in simple and immediate understanding. No explanation can help; an explanation can only destroy the whole joke. And I am here; I will tell you as many jokes as you want till you learn to get it.\nThere is no need either to go to Goa. Why harass people in Goa? Harass my people; they are accustomed to all kinds of nuts. And anyway, in India, the coconut is thought to be a very religious, sacred fruit. It is offered to God; there is no other offering which is better than a coconut.\nSo be here, harass my people – particularly Latifa, because she has to learn how to go beyond love and how to go beyond relationships. Unless you are related to nuts, it is very difficult to go\nbeyond. It is only the great nuts who have helped people to go beyond all relationships, renounce all relationships, learn to meditate, and just be alone.\nYou are absolutely needed here. First help Latifa. When you see that she has gone beyond, then there are other people waiting in a queue. And the more people you enlighten, the more is your virtue. You may not become enlightened yourself, but you are a great public servant. And as far as forgiving you is concerned, there is no need to mention it. You are already forgiven.\nAnd you are asking, “... so I can start afresh” – that sounds a little dangerous. What do you mean by starting afresh? Simply drop being a coconut! There is no need to start the same thing afresh. A fresh coconut or an old coconut, they are not much different; there is no generation gap. At least in coconuts there is no conflict, they are very traditional fellows. So please, don’t start afresh, just stop being a coconut. And don’t go anywhere else. Remain here so that I can go on hitting you. Sooner or later the understanding will dawn upon you that you are a human being, not a coconut.\nA very simple joke for you, so simple that if you miss it, then be ready for a great hit that will break your skull completely.\nA lion is walking down a jungle path and comes across a monkey. “Who is the king of the jungle?” he asks.\n“You are,” replies the monkey.\n“That’s right,” says the lion and walks on.\nHe soon encounters a giraffe. “Who is the king of the jungle?” he asks. “You are,” says the giraffe, bowing down his head.\nFinally the lion approaches an elephant. “Who is the king of the jungle?” he asks.\nThe elephant wraps his trunk around the lion, lifts him up, and hurls him against a coconut tree. After a few moments, the lion recovers, gets up, shakes the dust off, staggers back to the elephant and says, “Just because you don’t know the answer, there is no need to get pissed off!”\nQuestion 3 DEAR FRIEND,\nARE DACOITS AND VIKINGS REBELS? IF SO, ARE THEY BORN THAT WAY OR MADE, TURNED INTO REBELS? WHICH HALF OF THE DEFINITION DO THEY FULFILL, THE NEGATIVE SIDE OR THE POSITIVE ONE?\nBhai Mehta, the dacoits and the Vikings are not rebels at all, they are part of a criminal society. Your so-called kings and emperors are great dacoits; the dacoits operate on a smaller scale, but they belong to the same category.\nThe society depends on exploitation, oppression. A few people do it in an orderly way, a few people do it in a disorderly way, but their basic act is not different. A few people do it legally because they are intelligent and clever enough to use the law in their favor; and a few people who are not so clever and not so intelligent simply do the same thing but without using the law in their favor. They are condemned, but they are not rebels. They are part of this whole criminal situation that has remained prevalent from the very beginning of humanity till today.\nHence the question whether they are negative or positive does not arise – they are not rebels in the first place. They accept the society, they accept its so-called justice, they accept its law. When they are caught they themselves feel that they are criminals, that they have done something against the rules of the game.\nBut who makes the rules of the game? – bigger dacoits and bigger Vikings. Who are these people: Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah, Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Ronald Reagan... Do you call them dacoits, Vikings, or not? Just because they are clever enough to befool the masses, clever enough to dominate nationsNapoleon Bonaparte used to say, “My word is the law.” All these people, whether they say\nit or not, know perfectly well that they decide the rules of the game.\nAnybody who does not play the game according to their rules becomes a criminal. But he is not a rebel; he is simply not well-educated, he is simply not well-cultured. He does not know how to be a successful hypocrite. He may be a simple human being, but he also has ambitions. And he does not know that he can fulfill his ambitions by the ordinary pathways to success – he is not that intelligent. He finds a shortcut: he becomes a dacoit, he becomes a thief, he becomes a Viking. These are shortcuts to power, to fulfill ambitions, to be successful, to be rich, to be powerful.\nThe descendants of these dacoits – if these dacoits were big enough, great enough – became kings, queens and royal families. All the royal blood around the world belongs to the dacoits and the Vikings. You just have to go back to their forefathers, and you will find that in the beginning they were criminals who managed to be successful in controlling money, land, people.\nThe rebel is simply against the whole game, not against the rules. He is rebelling against the game itself. He is saying that the game itself is criminal, that this society is not yet civilized, not yet cultured – it is still barbarous.\nYou are also asking, “Are they born that way or made, turned into rebels?” The first thing I have cancelled – they are not rebels. But whoever they are, they are born that way. They bring the seeds with their birth.\nThe latest research in biochemistry is immensely revealing. It says that to punish a criminal is simply unscientific, inhuman. The criminal is the way he is, not because of his own will, it is his chemistry – he has inherited it. It is his hormones, his biology; it is his physiology, about which he cannot do anything. He is simply a victim of unconscious forces of nature. The more research that is being done about murderers, about rapists, about dacoits, the more it is becoming clear that they are born that way and punishment is not going to change them.\nHistory is a witness that all our systems of punishment have utterly failed; they have never reformed any individual. On the contrary, our jails have become universities of crime where novices enter,\namateurs enter, and come out seasoned criminals – well-qualified graduates under great criminal teachers inside the jail. You are sending amateurs to live with very experienced criminals.\nIn the jails, the whole atmosphere says one thing: to commit a crime is not crime, but to be caught is a crime. So learn the art of how to commit a crime without being caught, and then there is no question of your being a criminal.\nThe research categorically proves that our whole system of justice is a system of injustice, and that our whole idea of reforming people through punishment is absurd and stupid. It is not well founded on either reason or science.\nWhat is needed is that the man who is found committing some act against humanity has to be hospitalized or sent to the psychiatrist. He needs compassion and he needs treatment, not punishment. Punishment is a revenge by the society because he is not following your rules, because he is going against the crowd, because he is creating his own law.\nAll law enforcement authorities continuously insist, “Don’t take the law into your own hands.” And who has given them the authority to take the law into their own hands? Just because the crowd is with them... and the crowd consists of cowards, weaklings. The crowd wants to protect itself against the strong people; it joins hands and then it becomes a tremendous force.\nThe dacoits are really strong people, men with great pride. Your judges, your generals cannot face them individually. They are powerful because the crowd of cowards is behind them, because the armies are with them, because all the weapons and arms, jails, police forces and national guards are with them. So even cowardly judges are capable of sentencing a strong, proud man, who had the guts not to play the game according to your rules. He wanted to play according to his own rules. But he is not against the game; that has to be remembered.\nThe rebel is against the very game itself – this game of exploitation, this operation of reducing millions of people into slavery, millions of people into poverty; collecting all the money into a few hands.\nJust the other day somebody was telling me that there are only fifteen rich people in the whole of India. And the population of India right now is nine hundred million. In nine hundred million people, only fifteen people are rich! These are the real dacoits! These are the Vikings, these are the criminals!\nBut they are respectable. They will be awarded prizes from the president, because whatever they have done, they have done according to the rules. They are clever enough to find loopholes in the law; they can hire the best legal experts to find the loopholes and to use those loopholes. They have enough money to purchase the politicians; they have money to purchase the judges. Particularly in this country, every government official is for sale – you just have to find the right price.\nIn my childhood I used to hear that slavery had ended. Later on I discovered that this is a fiction. Slavery is absolutely in existence because you can purchase any man – even the president of the country or the prime minister of the country. You just have to know the right price and the right agent. Everybody is for sale in the marketplace, if not openly, then from the back door.\nThe rebel is one who simply sees the ugliness of this whole game. He wants to disconnect himself from the whole human past. He longs to create a new way of life where there will be no exploitation, where there will be no poor and no rich, where there will be no money as a means of exchange. He wants a world where there will be nobody superior and nobody inferior; where finally there will be no need of any government, no need of any judges, any courts, armies, and nations.\nIf a person is sick – somebody is a thief and is caught stealing – he needs the compassion of all. He has to be taken to the right person who can help change his chemistry, to give an injection of the right hormones to bring him into balance. All the rapists around the world will know, all the murderers will know, that if they are feeling a desire to murder – before that desire becomes too much and they become possessed by it, they have to go to the right experts: “Just please examine me. What is wrong with my chemistry, what is wrong with my body, what is wrong with my mind? I am feeling a tremendous urge to murder.”\nRapists have been found to have more male hormones than other human beings. Those hormones possess them, and whatever they do is done almost in madness. It is not their crime, they are born with it.\nIn fact, in a right kind of civilized society, every child should be checked from the very beginning, to see if he is balanced in every possible way. As he moves from class to class each year, he should be checked to see that everything is in balance. By the time he comes out of the university, he will have a balanced style of life. That will be true culture. You can expect him to always behave in a human way. The idea of murder or dacoity or suicide or rape will simply not arise in his mind. Now these are established scientific facts – I am not proposing a philosophy.\nAbhay Mehta, I am sorry I could not agree with anything that you have asked, because your whole question is based on misunderstanding.\nWhen George Moore, the Irish author, was eighty, he was asked how he managed to have lived such a long life. “I believe,” he said, “that it is due to the fact that I never smoked, drank or touched a girl until I was ten years of age.”\nThe doctor told Hymie Goldberg that he would need a slight operation. “Would you like a local anesthetic?” he asked.\n“Hang the expense,” said Goldberg. “Get the best, use imported... what do you mean by local anesthetic?”\nIt is very easy to misunderstand in many, many ways, particularly my idea about the rebel, because my rebel is not a revolutionary in the old sense. He is not a political being. He is against all ugly politics and there is no other kind in existence – there has never been.\nMy rebel is not a political being, because all revolutions have failed. To change society by changing its government has not been a successful idea because people who reach to power, rather than changing the society, are changed by power. It has happened so often that you cannot simply ignore it as an exception; it is the rule.\nHere in India, we have seen this country struggle for freedom and sacrifice its best people – like Bhagat Singh and Subhash Bose – thousands, with a great dream that freedom would bring happiness to the people. The hope could not be denied because the revolution was led by Mahatma Gandhi, a man who was thought to be a saint, worshipped almost like a god.\nThe freedom came, and the people whom Gandhi had trained, who looked so innocent, so pure, so simple... It created great hope in the masses that if power came to these people it would not corrupt them – these people who pray every day, these people who live in poverty, these people whose lives are an example for millions to follow.\nThe freedom came, and the power came into the hands of Mahatma Gandhi’s followers, who were all mini-saints – and power corrupted them all.\nInstead of freedom, there has only been a frustration. And the frustration has deepened every day; the night has become darker and darker. The question is being raised in every heart: “Is this the freedom for which thousands of people fought and died? Is this the freedom for which we all dreamed, and hoped would bring joy and celebration to the people?”\nIt has not brought anything. It has simply made more misery, more poverty, more immorality, more corrupt bureaucracy, more ugly politicians. It is a strange kind of revolution, but all the revolutions have done the same.\nThe rebel is not a revolutionary; he doesn’t believe in changing the society by changing the government. He believes in changing individuals, in changing himself, and spreading the flame from individual to individual. It seems to be a long way, but perhaps there is no shortcut.\nUnless individuals change, they cannot change the government and they cannot change the society. We have tried many times – in the Soviet Union, in France, in China, in India – to bring the change from above; it does not come.\nThe rebel believes in changing from the very roots.\nHis fight is not only political, his fight is multidimensional. He has to fight all rotten traditions, he has to fight all superstitious religions, he has to fight all dirty politics, he has to fight ugly systems of education.\nHe has to create a new man: meditative, silent, loving, understanding, intelligent, and spread it like a wildfire. He has hope and trust that people have lived for such a long, long time in misery, that it is time to bring the transformation. It will not come from above, it will come from below.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED MASTER,\nAFTER SCRIBBLING AND SCRATCHING, I ATTEMPT TO ASK A QUESTION ON WHAT UNDERSTANDING IS, BUT ONLY FIND MYSELF CAUGHT IN MY MIND. HOW IS IT THAT WE KNOW AND HAVE NAMES FOR FEELINGS, EMOTIONS, MOODS AND MIND SPACES,\nAND HOW IS IT THAT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO PHRASE A QUESTION, EVERYTHING FALLS SHORT?\nWHAT IS UNDERSTANDING? ARE MIND AND UNDERSTANDING HELPFUL TO A REBELLIOUS SPIRIT? CAN THE MIND AND THE HEART REALLY WORK TOGETHER?\nPrem Ratna, first, understanding is never of the mind; understanding is always from the beyond. Mind is only a mechanism. It is, in fact, in scientific terms, a biocomputer. A computer can function very efficiently, but first you have to feed it with all the information that you want; then you can ask any question concerning the information that you have already implanted in it. But you cannot ask a new question; the computer will be absolutely at a loss. It is only a memory, it is not intelligence.\nMind is a biocomputer – and very complicated. In fact, scientists say that the greatest computers that exist today in the world are not comparable to the biocomputer in an ordinary, average human being.\nAn intelligent man’s mind is capable of containing all the information that is in all the libraries of the world – it is almost infinite. But it has no intelligence of its own; it is a memory system. You feed it certain information, it will keep it on record. Whenever you want, it will supply it.\nIntelligence is of the being. Hence, a man of meditation becomes a man of understanding. He may not be very informative, he may not be very knowledgeable, but his responses will show great intelligence and great understanding in small but new situations.\nI have heard about a Zen master... The emperor of Japan had gone to see him. He always wanted to ask a question to a man who is thought to be enlightened, and this master was well known as an enlightened man. The emperor, with great courtesy, bowed down and asked the master, “I have come with a question: Is there a hell? Is there a heaven? – or are they simply fictions created by the priests?”\nThe Zen master looked into the eyes of the emperor and said, “You idiot! You doubt the wisdom of the ages? You should first learn how to behave with an enlightened man. This is not the way of asking a question!”\nThe emperor could not believe... nobody in his life had ever called him an idiot; and he had not done anything he could even rationalize as supporting the absurd outburst of the Zen master. He was a great samurai, a warrior, and he could not tolerate this abusive language and this insult. And he was no ordinary man, he was the emperor of the whole country. He pulled out his sword – and the master sat there. He was just going to hit and cut off his head, when the master laughed and said, “Here opens the doors of hell!”\nSuddenly he stopped, seeing the meaning of the master – he has answered his question. But the master is not a knowledgeable man, he believes more in actual situations. He has created the situation to show him the way to hell.\nThe emperor started putting his sword back into its sheath, and the master said, “Here opens the door to heaven!”\nThere was great silence for a moment and the master said, “Have you another question? Have I answered you rightly?”\nThe emperor touched his feet and said, “I have asked the same question to many great scholars, learned professors, and they have tried to explain – they quoted ancient scriptures, they gave arguments in support of, or against. But nobody convinced me. You have not said a single word in support of heaven or hell, and you have dissolved my question.”\nThe master said, “No question can be answered, only understanding can be provoked, and I provoked your understanding. For a moment you were not in your mind. Remember that space. Bring that space again and again, because that is the space from where understanding flows.”\nMeditation is the source of understanding. Mind is a collection of information and knowledge.\nSecondly, Prem Ratna, you are asking, “How is it that when attempting to phrase a question, everything falls short?”... Because all questions can be framed only through the mind, by the mind, in language.\nBut the authentic questions arise in your being, in silence, like whisperings without words; and the mind is incapable of translating them into words. So when you are feeling a question, you know what you want to ask; but the moment you start writing it, you suddenly feel that what you have written falls very short – it is not the same question that you were feeling.\nIt is not only with you, it is with everyone; it is not only today, it has always been so and will always remain so. No question can be justified by your inner consciousness because whatever arises there is beyond language, beyond mind, beyond their capacities.\nNaturally you will ask, “Then what to do?” You will have to learn to ask in silence, and you will have to learn to listen in silence. Neither have you to ask it, nor have I to answer it.\nAnd you will receive the answer. And the question will disappear.\nSo all that you have to do is to deepen the silences of your heart, to go more and more towards meditation; away from mind, away from language, away from words. And if in deep silence there is a quivering of question, I am here. You need not ask it – I will answer it.\nI may not answer through words, but I will find a way... perhaps through a gesture, or perhaps just looking into your eyes, or perhaps just being silent for a moment. But I will answer it. You just have to ask it in silence, without words.\nHow will you know that I have answered? You will know because it will no longer be there – the question will disappear. You won’t get any answer as such, but the question will be gone.\nThe function of the master is not to go on answering you, the function of the master is to create a situation in which all your questions dissolve and you are left without questions.\nThat beautiful space without questions is the answer. I’m saying the answer for all your millions of questions.\nAnd thirdly, you are asking, “Can the mind and the heart really work together?” They can work together, but it is one of the greatest arts – you will have to learn a certain discipline. As they are, they are far away from each other; they speak different languages. Mind speaks in words, in thoughts; heart speaks in feelings, moods, but no words. But there is a certain art in bringing them together, in making a bridge – and then they can function in harmony.\nWhat I am calling the silences of your heart will create the bridge. Meditation will be the bridge between your mind and your heart. On the one side it will be able to communicate with the mind, on the other side it will be able to communicate with the heart. It will be a translator between two centers within you which don’t speak the same language.\nBut it is a very subtle art, and very few people have been able to attain to it: a few poets, a few musicians, a few mystics. Musicians have been the closest because they use music instead of language. It can express the language; it can also express the feeling and the mood. It can join the heart and the mind. The poet speaks through language, but what he says comes from the heart; he speaks his heart through the mind.\nThese are great disciplines, but the easiest way – because that will open other doors too – is meditation. Just becoming silent, utterly silent, you will find mind and heart coming closer. In the silence, there is a communion. The mind speaks not, the heart says nothing, but they are both overwhelmed by the understanding of meditation and they start functioning in a harmony. But remember, whether through music or poetry or dance or meditation, the art is very subtle.\nI’m reminded of a storyThree of Japan’s greatest swordsmen stand poised for a competition to\nbegin. An enormous crowd has gathered for the event. Emperor Wu nods his head and an attendant releases a fly from a small container. Whoosh! Quicker than the human eye, the sword of the first samurai neatly splits the fly into two parts. The crowd roars its approval. Another nod from the emperor and a second fly is released. Whoosh! Whoosh! The second samurai has hardly moved, but before him lies the fly, cut cleanly into four pieces. The crowd gasps in disbelief.\nWu studies the third samurai for a long moment, then nods to the attendant who releases another fly. The third samurai makes an impressive flourish with his sword, but the fly can still be heard buzzing around. He resumes his stance as the fly buzzes off into the morning sky. Laughter and giggling ripple through the crowd.\nEmperor Wu thinks he’s being mocked and made into a laughingstock. He’s furious. “I will have your head for this, you insolent samurai. That fly got away.”\n“I know,” smiles the samurai wiping his sword, “but he will never make love again.” Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5761","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebel/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebel/>The Rebel</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 As below, so above</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5761 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Rebel/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

FOR YEARS I HAVE LOVED STORIES OF
GURDJIEFF AND ZEN MASTERS WHO HIT THEIR DISCIPLES SO HARD THAT THEY GET
IT.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT YOU STRUCK YOUR SCALPEL SHARP – NO ANESTHETIC –
REMOVING A CANCER THAT’S BEEN THERE FOR LIVES. IT HURT, BUT THE PATIENT
FEELS HEALTHIER AND EVEN LONGS WITH A PASSION TO EXPOSE MORE AND MORE.
PART OF ME SAYS, “NO, THIS IS JUST GREED AND EXHIBITIONISM.” IS THERE A
RIGHT WAY TO EXPOSE ONESELF TO A MASTER?</p><p><br></p><p>Indivar, learn not to listen to your mind, it always leads you
astray. Its advice is always categorically poisonous. Rise above your
mind; only from that height can you see clearly. To be in the mind is to
be in the clouds. Just a little higher and the sky is clean; you can see
the farthest stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Your heart was understanding absolutely and exactly what the
situation was. Immediately your mind started interfering and saying,
“No, this is just greed and exhibitionism.” It is neither greed nor
exhibitionism, because both are part of the ego. And I have not hit you,
but the ego which is pretending to be you. It will try to protect itself
in every way. But once you start understanding the language of the
heart, the subtle nuances of your innermost being, the ego becomes
powerless, loses its domination over you.</p><p>You are asking, “Is there a right way to expose oneself to a master?”
Every way is right as far as exposing yourself is concerned. Expose in
any way – but expose! Open your windows and doors, become vulnerable.
All ways of opening are right, and all ways of closing yourself are
wrong. There is no right way of closing, and there is no wrong way of
exposing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that you went to every person who had been bowing down
his head in love, in trust and gratitude, and offered your apology. That
makes you an authentic sannyasin. Any pseudo-sannyasin would have
escaped and started creating lies and rumors and allegations against me.
But instead of doing that, you went to sannyasins to offer your
apology.</p><p><br></p><p>You proved your mettle, you proved your dignity, you proved your
understanding; and you proved that you are courageous enough to be
humble, courageous enough to put your ego aside. Now let this incident
not become just a memory, a faraway remembrance. Let this become your
moment to moment understanding, becoming deeper, becoming clearer. And
it will bring you immense blessings.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little bit of understanding can bring a tremendous revolution
in your life. All seeds are small – the trees may grow high, almost
touching the stars, but the seeds are very small. This is just a seed
that has fallen into your heart; now allow it to grow. Give nourishment
to it, support it, remove all hindrances in its path; and a small seed,
which seems to be nothing special in this moment, may bring thousands of
flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little waiting, just a little patience for the spring to
come... it always comes. We miss it if we don’t have any seeds in our
heart – spring comes and goes, nothing blossoms in us. If we have seeds
in our heart, then the coming of the spring is understood by every cell
and fiber of our being, and the blossoming of our potential becomes a
reality forever. The inner spring only comes – it never goes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear Mother,” wrote Paddy to his old, old mother. “I am sending some
pills that a witch doctor gave me, and if you take one it will take
years off your life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy came home a few weeks later, and there was a beautiful young
woman outside his house, rocking a pram in which a baby lay sucking a
bottle. “Where is my mother?” asked Paddy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be silly,” said the woman, “I am your mother. And those pills
were marvelous.” “Imagine that,” said Paddy. “Only one pill – and what
is more, you were able to have a baby.” “Are you crazy?” cried the
woman. “That is not a baby. That is your father. He took two.”</p><p>Greed can be dangerous; but there has been no greed, only a
misunderstanding. There has not really been greed or exhibitionism. But
mind will always use that strategy: whenever you are moving in the right
way, the mind will suggest that something is wrong. And the strangest
thing about mind is, when you are going wrong it will remain silent; it
will not say anything at all. Take it as a criterion: when mind says
that something is wrong, do it. When mind says something is right, don’t
do it. That’s how one gets free from the fetters of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE EXPOSE ME. IS THIS WHAT ZARATHUSTRA CALLS “THE CRUEL HONESTY”?
IS SINCERITY A HIGH VALUE IN LIFE? BELOVED MASTER, DID I GET THE JOKE?
CAN YOU GIVE ME THE RIGHT NUMBER TO PHONE? DO I NEED TO BE SENT TO GOA,
OR CAN YOU AND THIS BEAUTIFUL COMMUNE FORGIVE ME, SO I CAN START
AFRESH?</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyan Om, it is not what Zarathustra calls “The cruel honesty,” it is
a very mild form. But if you insist on being a nut, I may have to use
cruel honesty too. But your nut has to be broken.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “Is sincerity a high value in life?” It is the
highest value in life. A life which is not sincere is not worth living
at all. A life which is not sincere is fake – it is pseudo; you are
playing a role in which your heart is absent, you are saying things
which you don’t mean. You are living as if on somebody else’s behalf.
And you call it life! Sincerity and life are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also asking me, “Did I get the joke? Can you give me the
right number to phone? Do I need to be sent to Goa, or can you and this
beautiful commune forgive me, so I can start afresh?”</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing – you could not get the joke, neither could Latifa
get it. You were both discussing it and you could not come to a
conclusion about what it means.</p><p><br></p><p>I had told you beforehand that Latifa will not get it – that is her
German heritage. If she were capable of getting the joke she would not
be with you either. The very fact that she is with you is enough proof
that she is also a hard German – you may be a hard coconut, it does not
matter.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to be worried about the joke. Just start listening
more attentively. One misses a joke only when one is not listening
attentively, because the moment of understanding a joke is a very small
moment. You may have heard the whole joke, but just before the punch
line there is a small turning. The turning is so small, delicate and
subtle, that if you miss it you cannot connect the punch line with the
rest of the joke that you have heard – and then you are at a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>A joke is a beautiful method to check on your awareness – whether you
are simply hearing, or listening too. There is no need to have a phone
number. I can give you the right phone number – even to God – but there
is no need to bother anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Just listen to the tape again or see the video again. However hard a
coconut you may be, there must be some juice inside. You will get it.
And it is one of the mysteries of jokes that they cannot be explained –
once you explain a joke, it is no longer a joke. Its whole beauty lies
in simple and immediate understanding. No explanation can help; an
explanation can only destroy the whole joke. And I am here; I will tell
you as many jokes as you want till you learn to get it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need either to go to Goa. Why harass people in Goa?
Harass my people; they are accustomed to all kinds of nuts. And anyway,
in India, the coconut is thought to be a very religious, sacred fruit.
It is offered to God; there is no other offering which is better than a
coconut.</p><p><br></p><p>So be here, harass my people – particularly Latifa, because she has
to learn how to go beyond love and how to go beyond relationships.
Unless you are related to nuts, it is very difficult to go</p><p>beyond. It is only the great nuts who have helped people to go beyond
all relationships, renounce all relationships, learn to meditate, and
just be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>You are absolutely needed here. First help Latifa. When you see that
she has gone beyond, then there are other people waiting in a queue. And
the more people you enlighten, the more is your virtue. You may not
become enlightened yourself, but you are a great public servant. And as
far as forgiving you is concerned, there is no need to mention it. You
are already forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are asking, “... so I can start afresh” – that sounds a
little dangerous. What do you mean by starting afresh? Simply drop being
a coconut! There is no need to start the same thing afresh. A fresh
coconut or an old coconut, they are not much different; there is no
generation gap. At least in coconuts there is no conflict, they are very
traditional fellows. So please, don’t start afresh, just stop being a
coconut. And don’t go anywhere else. Remain here so that I can go on
hitting you. Sooner or later the understanding will dawn upon you that
you are a human being, not a coconut.</p><p><br></p><p>A very simple joke for you, so simple that if you miss it, then be
ready for a great hit that will break your skull completely.</p><p><br></p><p>A lion is walking down a jungle path and comes across a monkey. “Who
is the king of the jungle?” he asks.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are,” replies the monkey.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s right,” says the lion and walks on.</p><p><br></p><p>He soon encounters a giraffe. “Who is the king of the jungle?” he
asks. “You are,” says the giraffe, bowing down his head.</p><p>Finally the lion approaches an elephant. “Who is the king of the
jungle?” he asks.</p><p><br></p><p>The elephant wraps his trunk around the lion, lifts him up, and hurls
him against a coconut tree. After a few moments, the lion recovers, gets
up, shakes the dust off, staggers back to the elephant and says, “Just
because you don’t know the answer, there is no need to get pissed
off!”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 DEAR FRIEND,</p><p>ARE DACOITS AND VIKINGS REBELS? IF SO, ARE THEY BORN THAT WAY OR
MADE, TURNED INTO REBELS? WHICH HALF OF THE DEFINITION DO THEY FULFILL,
THE NEGATIVE SIDE OR THE POSITIVE ONE?</p><p><br></p><p>Bhai Mehta, the dacoits and the Vikings are not rebels at all, they
are part of a criminal society. Your so-called kings and emperors are
great dacoits; the dacoits operate on a smaller scale, but they belong
to the same category.</p><p>The society depends on exploitation, oppression. A few people do it
in an orderly way, a few people do it in a disorderly way, but their
basic act is not different. A few people do it legally because they are
intelligent and clever enough to use the law in their favor; and a few
people who are not so clever and not so intelligent simply do the same
thing but without using the law in their favor. They are condemned, but
they are not rebels. They are part of this whole criminal situation that
has remained prevalent from the very beginning of humanity till
today.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence the question whether they are negative or positive does not
arise – they are not rebels in the first place. They accept the society,
they accept its so-called justice, they accept its law. When they are
caught they themselves feel that they are criminals, that they have done
something against the rules of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>But who makes the rules of the game? – bigger dacoits and bigger
Vikings. Who are these people: Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah,
Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, Adolf
Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Ronald Reagan... Do you call
them dacoits, Vikings, or not? Just because they are clever enough to
befool the masses, clever enough to dominate nations<span class=s4></span>Napoleon Bonaparte used to say, “My word is the law.”
All these people, whether they say</p><p>it or not, know perfectly well that they decide the rules of the
game.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody who does not play the game according to their rules becomes a
criminal. But he is not a rebel; he is simply not well-educated, he is
simply not well-cultured. He does not know how to be a successful
hypocrite. He may be a simple human being, but he also has ambitions.
And he does not know that he can fulfill his ambitions by the ordinary
pathways to success – he is not that intelligent. He finds a shortcut:
he becomes a dacoit, he becomes a thief, he becomes a Viking. These are
shortcuts to power, to fulfill ambitions, to be successful, to be rich,
to be powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>The descendants of these dacoits – if these dacoits were big enough,
great enough – became kings, queens and royal families. All the royal
blood around the world belongs to the dacoits and the Vikings. You just
have to go back to their forefathers, and you will find that in the
beginning they were criminals who managed to be successful in
controlling money, land, people.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel is simply against the whole game, not against the rules. He
is rebelling against the game itself. He is saying that the game itself
is criminal, that this society is not yet civilized, not yet cultured –
it is still barbarous.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also asking, “Are they born that way or made, turned into
rebels?” The first thing I have cancelled – they are not rebels. But
whoever they are, they are born that way. They bring the seeds with
their birth.</p><p><br></p><p>The latest research in biochemistry is immensely revealing. It says
that to punish a criminal is simply unscientific, inhuman. The criminal
is the way he is, not because of his own will, it is his chemistry – he
has inherited it. It is his hormones, his biology; it is his physiology,
about which he cannot do anything. He is simply a victim of unconscious
forces of nature. The more research that is being done about murderers,
about rapists, about dacoits, the more it is becoming clear that they
are born that way and punishment is not going to change them.</p><p><br></p><p>History is a witness that all our systems of punishment have utterly
failed; they have never reformed any individual. On the contrary, our
jails have become universities of crime where novices enter,</p><p>amateurs enter, and come out seasoned criminals – well-qualified
graduates under great criminal teachers inside the jail. You are sending
amateurs to live with very experienced criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>In the jails, the whole atmosphere says one thing: to commit a crime
is not crime, but to be caught is a crime. So learn the art of how to
commit a crime without being caught, and then there is no question of
your being a criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>The research categorically proves that our whole system of justice is
a system of injustice, and that our whole idea of reforming people
through punishment is absurd and stupid. It is not well founded on
either reason or science.</p><p><br></p><p>What is needed is that the man who is found committing some act
against humanity has to be hospitalized or sent to the psychiatrist. He
needs compassion and he needs treatment, not punishment. Punishment is a
revenge by the society because he is not following your rules, because
he is going against the crowd, because he is creating his own law.</p><p><br></p><p>All law enforcement authorities continuously insist, “Don’t take the
law into your own hands.” And who has given them the authority to take
the law into their own hands? Just because the crowd is with them... and
the crowd consists of cowards, weaklings. The crowd wants to protect
itself against the strong people; it joins hands and then it becomes a
tremendous force.</p><p><br></p><p>The dacoits are really strong people, men with great pride. Your
judges, your generals cannot face them individually. They are powerful
because the crowd of cowards is behind them, because the armies are with
them, because all the weapons and arms, jails, police forces and
national guards are with them. So even cowardly judges are capable of
sentencing a strong, proud man, who had the guts not to play the game
according to your rules. He wanted to play according to his own rules.
But he is not against the game; that has to be remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel is against the very game itself – this game of
exploitation, this operation of reducing millions of people into
slavery, millions of people into poverty; collecting all the money into
a few hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day somebody was telling me that there are only
fifteen rich people in the whole of India. And the population of India
right now is nine hundred million. In nine hundred million people, only
fifteen people are rich! These are the real dacoits! These are the
Vikings, these are the criminals!</p><p><br></p><p>But they are respectable. They will be awarded prizes from the
president, because whatever they have done, they have done according to
the rules. They are clever enough to find loopholes in the law; they can
hire the best legal experts to find the loopholes and to use those
loopholes. They have enough money to purchase the politicians; they have
money to purchase the judges. Particularly in this country, every
government official is for sale – you just have to find the right
price.</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood I used to hear that slavery had ended. Later on I
discovered that this is a fiction. Slavery is absolutely in existence
because you can purchase any man – even the president of the country or
the prime minister of the country. You just have to know the right price
and the right agent. Everybody is for sale in the marketplace, if not
openly, then from the back door.</p><p>The rebel is one who simply sees the ugliness of this whole game. He
wants to disconnect himself from the whole human past. He longs to
create a new way of life where there will be no exploitation, where
there will be no poor and no rich, where there will be no money as a
means of exchange. He wants a world where there will be nobody superior
and nobody inferior; where finally there will be no need of any
government, no need of any judges, any courts, armies, and nations.</p><p><br></p><p>If a person is sick – somebody is a thief and is caught stealing – he
needs the compassion of all. He has to be taken to the right person who
can help change his chemistry, to give an injection of the right
hormones to bring him into balance. All the rapists around the world
will know, all the murderers will know, that if they are feeling a
desire to murder – before that desire becomes too much and they become
possessed by it, they have to go to the right experts: “Just please
examine me. What is wrong with my chemistry, what is wrong with my body,
what is wrong with my mind? I am feeling a tremendous urge to
murder.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rapists have been found to have more male hormones than other human
beings. Those hormones possess them, and whatever they do is done almost
in madness. It is not their crime, they are born with it.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, in a right kind of civilized society, every child should be
checked from the very beginning, to see if he is balanced in every
possible way. As he moves from class to class each year, he should be
checked to see that everything is in balance. By the time he comes out
of the university, he will have a balanced style of life. That will be
true culture. You can expect him to always behave in a human way. The
idea of murder or dacoity or suicide or rape will simply not arise in
his mind. Now these are established scientific facts – I am not
proposing a philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>Abhay Mehta, I am sorry I could not agree with anything that you have
asked, because your whole question is based on misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>When George Moore, the Irish author, was eighty, he was asked how he
managed to have lived such a long life. “I believe,” he said, “that it
is due to the fact that I never smoked, drank or touched a girl until I
was ten years of age.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor told Hymie Goldberg that he would need a slight operation.
“Would you like a local anesthetic?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hang the expense,” said Goldberg. “Get the best, use imported...
what do you mean by local anesthetic?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to misunderstand in many, many ways, particularly my
idea about the rebel, because my rebel is not a revolutionary in the old
sense. He is not a political being. He is against all ugly politics and
there is no other kind in existence – there has never been.</p><p><br></p><p>My rebel is not a political being, because all revolutions have
failed. To change society by changing its government has not been a
successful idea because people who reach to power, rather than changing
the society, are changed by power. It has happened so often that you
cannot simply ignore it as an exception; it is the rule.</p><p>Here in India, we have seen this country struggle for freedom and
sacrifice its best people – like Bhagat Singh and Subhash Bose –
thousands, with a great dream that freedom would bring happiness to the
people. The hope could not be denied because the revolution was led by
Mahatma Gandhi, a man who was thought to be a saint, worshipped almost
like a god.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom came, and the people whom Gandhi had trained, who looked
so innocent, so pure, so simple... It created great hope in the masses
that if power came to these people it would not corrupt them – these
people who pray every day, these people who live in poverty, these
people whose lives are an example for millions to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom came, and the power came into the hands of Mahatma
Gandhi’s followers, who were all mini-saints – and power corrupted them
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of freedom, there has only been a frustration. And the
frustration has deepened every day; the night has become darker and
darker. The question is being raised in every heart: “Is this the
freedom for which thousands of people fought and died? Is this the
freedom for which we all dreamed, and hoped would bring joy and
celebration to the people?”</p><p><br></p><p>It has not brought anything. It has simply made more misery, more
poverty, more immorality, more corrupt bureaucracy, more ugly
politicians. It is a strange kind of revolution, but all the revolutions
have done the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel is not a revolutionary; he doesn’t believe in changing the
society by changing the government. He believes in changing individuals,
in changing himself, and spreading the flame from individual to
individual. It seems to be a long way, but perhaps there is no
shortcut.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless individuals change, they cannot change the government and they
cannot change the society. We have tried many times – in the Soviet
Union, in France, in China, in India – to bring the change from above;
it does not come.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebel believes in changing from the very roots.</p><p><br></p><p>His fight is not only political, his fight is multidimensional. He
has to fight all rotten traditions, he has to fight all superstitious
religions, he has to fight all dirty politics, he has to fight ugly
systems of education.</p><p><br></p><p>He has to create a new man: meditative, silent, loving,
understanding, intelligent, and spread it like a wildfire. He has hope
and trust that people have lived for such a long, long time in misery,
that it is time to bring the transformation. It will not come from
above, it will come from below.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>AFTER SCRIBBLING AND SCRATCHING, I ATTEMPT TO ASK A QUESTION ON WHAT
UNDERSTANDING IS, BUT ONLY FIND MYSELF CAUGHT IN MY MIND. HOW IS IT THAT
WE KNOW AND HAVE NAMES FOR FEELINGS, EMOTIONS, MOODS AND MIND
SPACES,</p><p>AND HOW IS IT THAT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO PHRASE A QUESTION, EVERYTHING
FALLS SHORT?</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING? ARE MIND AND UNDERSTANDING HELPFUL TO A
REBELLIOUS SPIRIT? CAN THE MIND AND THE HEART REALLY WORK TOGETHER?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Ratna, first, understanding is never of the mind; understanding
is always from the beyond. Mind is only a mechanism. It is, in fact, in
scientific terms, a biocomputer. A computer can function very
efficiently, but first you have to feed it with all the information that
you want; then you can ask any question concerning the information that
you have already implanted in it. But you cannot ask a new question; the
computer will be absolutely at a loss. It is only a memory, it is not
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is a biocomputer – and very complicated. In fact, scientists say
that the greatest computers that exist today in the world are not
comparable to the biocomputer in an ordinary, average human being.</p><p><br></p><p>An intelligent man’s mind is capable of containing all the
information that is in all the libraries of the world – it is almost
infinite. But it has no intelligence of its own; it is a memory system.
You feed it certain information, it will keep it on record. Whenever you
want, it will supply it.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is of the being. Hence, a man of meditation becomes a
man of understanding. He may not be very informative, he may not be very
knowledgeable, but his responses will show great intelligence and great
understanding in small but new situations.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a Zen master... The emperor of Japan had gone to
see him. He always wanted to ask a question to a man who is thought to
be enlightened, and this master was well known as an enlightened man.
The emperor, with great courtesy, bowed down and asked the master, “I
have come with a question: Is there a hell? Is there a heaven? – or are
they simply fictions created by the priests?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen master looked into the eyes of the emperor and said, “You
idiot! You doubt the wisdom of the ages? You should first learn how to
behave with an enlightened man. This is not the way of asking a
question!”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor could not believe... nobody in his life had ever called
him an idiot; and he had not done anything he could even rationalize as
supporting the absurd outburst of the Zen master. He was a great
samurai, a warrior, and he could not tolerate this abusive language and
this insult. And he was no ordinary man, he was the emperor of the whole
country. He pulled out his sword – and the master sat there. He was just
going to hit and cut off his head, when the master laughed and said,
“Here opens the doors of hell!”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he stopped, seeing the meaning of the master – he has
answered his question. But the master is not a knowledgeable man, he
believes more in actual situations. He has created the situation to show
him the way to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor started putting his sword back into its sheath, and the
master said, “Here opens the door to heaven!”</p><p>There was great silence for a moment and the master said, “Have you
another question? Have I answered you rightly?”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor touched his feet and said, “I have asked the same
question to many great scholars, learned professors, and they have tried
to explain – they quoted ancient scriptures, they gave arguments in
support of, or against. But nobody convinced me. You have not said a
single word in support of heaven or hell, and you have dissolved my
question.”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “No question can be answered, only understanding can
be provoked, and I provoked your understanding. For a moment you were
not in your mind. Remember that space. Bring that space again and again,
because that is the space from where understanding flows.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the source of understanding. Mind is a collection of
information and knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, Prem Ratna, you are asking, “How is it that when attempting
to phrase a question, everything falls short?”... Because all questions
can be framed only through the mind, by the mind, in language.</p><p><br></p><p>But the authentic questions arise in your being, in silence, like
whisperings without words; and the mind is incapable of translating them
into words. So when you are feeling a question, you know what you want
to ask; but the moment you start writing it, you suddenly feel that what
you have written falls very short – it is not the same question that you
were feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only with you, it is with everyone; it is not only today,
it has always been so and will always remain so. No question can be
justified by your inner consciousness because whatever arises there is
beyond language, beyond mind, beyond their capacities.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally you will ask, “Then what to do?” You will have to learn to
ask in silence, and you will have to learn to listen in silence. Neither
have you to ask it, nor have I to answer it.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will receive the answer. And the question will disappear.</p><p>So all that you have to do is to deepen the silences of your heart,
to go more and more towards meditation; away from mind, away from
language, away from words. And if in deep silence there is a quivering
of question, I am here. You need not ask it – I will answer it.</p><p><br></p><p>I may not answer through words, but I will find a way... perhaps
through a gesture, or perhaps just looking into your eyes, or perhaps
just being silent for a moment. But I will answer it. You just have to
ask it in silence, without words.</p><p><br></p><p>How will you know that I have answered? You will know because it will
no longer be there – the question will disappear. You won’t get any
answer as such, but the question will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the master is not to go on answering you, the
function of the master is to create a situation in which all your
questions dissolve and you are left without questions.</p><p>That beautiful space without questions is the answer. I’m saying the
answer for all your millions of questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, you are asking, “Can the mind and the heart really work
together?” They can work together, but it is one of the greatest arts –
you will have to learn a certain discipline. As they are, they are far
away from each other; they speak different languages. Mind speaks in
words, in thoughts; heart speaks in feelings, moods, but no words. But
there is a certain art in bringing them together, in making a bridge –
and then they can function in harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am calling the silences of your heart will create the bridge.
Meditation will be the bridge between your mind and your heart. On the
one side it will be able to communicate with the mind, on the other side
it will be able to communicate with the heart. It will be a translator
between two centers within you which don’t speak the same language.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is a very subtle art, and very few people have been able to
attain to it: a few poets, a few musicians, a few mystics. Musicians
have been the closest because they use music instead of language. It can
express the language; it can also express the feeling and the mood. It
can join the heart and the mind. The poet speaks through language, but
what he says comes from the heart; he speaks his heart through the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>These are great disciplines, but the easiest way – because that will
open other doors too – is meditation. Just becoming silent, utterly
silent, you will find mind and heart coming closer. In the silence,
there is a communion. The mind speaks not, the heart says nothing, but
they are both overwhelmed by the understanding of meditation and they
start functioning in a harmony. But remember, whether through music or
poetry or dance or meditation, the art is very subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m reminded of a story<span class=s4></span>Three of Japan’s
greatest swordsmen stand poised for a competition to</p><p>begin. An enormous crowd has gathered for the event. Emperor Wu nods
his head and an attendant releases a fly from a small container. Whoosh!
Quicker than the human eye, the sword of the first samurai neatly splits
the fly into two parts. The crowd roars its approval. Another nod from
the emperor and a second fly is released. Whoosh! Whoosh! The second
samurai has hardly moved, but before him lies the fly, cut cleanly into
four pieces. The crowd gasps in disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>Wu studies the third samurai for a long moment, then nods to the
attendant who releases another fly. The third samurai makes an
impressive flourish with his sword, but the fly can still be heard
buzzing around. He resumes his stance as the fly buzzes off into the
morning sky. Laughter and giggling ripple through the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Emperor Wu thinks he’s being mocked and made into a laughingstock.
He’s furious. “I will have your head for this, you insolent samurai.
That fly got away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know,” smiles the samurai wiping his sword, “but he will never
make love again.” Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

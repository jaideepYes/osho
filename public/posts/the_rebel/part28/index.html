NOT THAT I DON’T WANT SEX AND THAT I AM NOT COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO APPROACH WOMEN, BUT IT JUST DOESN’T HAPPEN.\nWHEN I APPROACH A WOMAN LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL ENERGY IS FLOWING, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SEX, THE ENERGY CHANGES. IT ALMOST FEELS AS IF FALLING ASLEEP. WHEN I THEN TRY TO GET IT GOING AGAIN, THE WOMAN FEELS OFFENDED; SHE DOESN’T FEEL CONNECTED ANY MORE, AND FEELS THAT I AM NOT ACCEPTING HER SPACE. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?\nBELOVED MASTER, CAN YOU HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND?\nGyan Atito, what is happening to you is not a curse; it is a blessing. It is just your old mind that is interpreting it as if something is going wrong. Everything is going right, the way it should go. Sex has to disappear into a peaceful, playful rejoicing – into a harmony of two silent beings; not meeting in their bodies, but meeting in their very souls.\nIt is going to happen to every sannyasin. Don’t force yourself to do anything against what is happening on its own accord. Any forcing on your part will be a hindrance in your spiritual growth.\nThis is something very important to remember, and this will explain to you why all the religions have gone against sex. It was a misunderstanding – but a very natural misunderstanding. Everybody\nwho has been in meditation goes through the transformation of the energies – the energies that are going downward start moving upward, opening your higher centers of consciousness, bringing new skies to your being. But you are unacquainted with them, they are unknown to you; hence, one may get frightened. And if it is happening only to one partner, then there is going to be trouble. Both the partners in meditation have to be transforming simultaneously – only then can they keep pace with each other. Otherwise they are going to fall apart.\nThis created the idea of celibacy. Because in marriage it was found continuously that if one partner became interested in meditation, the marriage was jeopardized. It was better not to get involved, not to hurt somebody else’s feelings, and remain alone. But this was a wrong decision.\nThe right decision would have been that if one partner in a marriage or in a friendship is growing, he should help the other also to move into the new spaces. He should not leave the other partner behind. This would have been a tremendous revolution in human consciousness; but because religions had chosen celibacy, the whole world remained without meditation.\nAnd those who had chosen celibacy – it was a chosen thing, it had not happened to them – became perverted sexually. They were not beyond sex, hence celibacy. They tried the other way: celibacy first, thinking that then would come the transformation. It does not work that way. Transformation has to be first. Then, without any inhibition, without fighting with sex, without condemning sex, a transformation comes on its own. But it does not come by celibacy, it comes by meditation. And it does not come by repression, it comes by a loving atmosphere. The celibate lives in an atmosphere of repression, inhibition, perversion; his whole atmosphere is psychologically sick. This was one fundamental point where all religions went wrong.\nSecondly, every meditator has found that sex starts disappearing into something tremendously different – from biology into something spiritual. Rather than creating a bondage, a possessiveness, it opens up doors of freedom. All relationships disappear and one feels, in his aloneness, absolute contentment; a fulfillment that one could not even have dreamed of.\nBut because meditators found this happening, without any exception, the people who wanted to meditate inferred wrongly that perhaps repressing sex is going to help them in transforming their energies. Hence all organized religions started teaching a life of condemnation, renunciation; a life which is basically negative. This was a misunderstanding.\nThrough repressing sex you can pervert the energy but you cannot convert it. Conversion comes as you become more silent, as your heart becomes more harmonious, as your mind becomes more and more peaceful. As you start coming closer and closer to your being, to your very center, a transformation that is not your doing happens on its own accord. The energy that you had known as sexual becomes your very spirituality. It is the same energy, just the direction has changed. It is not going downward, it is moving upward.\nWhat is happening to you, Gyan Atito, is going to happen to every sannyasin – without exception. Hence your question is going to be everybody’s question sooner or later. And whenever it happens, the partner who is left behind should not feel offended but on the contrary, should feel blissful and happy that at least to his beloved, or to his friend, a beautiful experience is happening, “And I hope to join him or her as soon as possible.”\nYour effort should be to go deeper into meditation so you can keep company with your partner, and you can go on dancing together towards the ultimate goal of life. But remember, as you will grow in your spirituality your sexuality is going to disappear. There will be a new kind of love – a purity, a deep innocence, with no possessiveness, with no jealousy; but with all the compassion in the world, to help each other in the inner growth.\nSo you should not feel that something has gone wrong with you; something has suddenly gone right with you. You were not alert; you have been caught unawares.\nLittle Hymie was walking along the street with little Betty, aged four. As they were about to cross the street, little Hymie remembered his mother’s teaching.\n“Let me hold your hand,” he offered gallantly.\n“Okay,” replied Betty. “But I want you to know you are playing with fire.”\nAny relationship between man and woman is playing with fire – and particularly if you also start being a meditator. Then you are surrounded by a wildfire, because so many changes are going to happen – for which you are not prepared, and cannot be prepared. You are going to travel in an unknown territory every moment, every day. And there will be many times when either you will be left behind, or your partner will be left behind – and this will be a deep anguish to both.\nIn the beginning, when it starts, the natural inference will be that the relationship is finished, that you are no more in love. Certainly you are no more in the love that you were before – that old love is no longer possible. That was animal love, it is good that it is gone. Now a higher quality, something more divine, is going to take place. But you have to help each other.\nThese are the real difficult times – when you come to know whether you love your partner, and whether your partner loves you – when these great gaps arise between you and you feel you are going far away from each other. These are the crucial moments, a fire test, when you should try to bring the other person, who is left behind, closer to you. You should help the other person to be meditative.\nThe natural idea will be to bring yourself down so the other is not offended. That’s an absolutely wrong attitude. You are not helping the other, you are hurting yourself. A good opportunity is being lost. When you could have pulled the other towards heights, you have descended yourself.\nDon’t be worried that the other will be offended. You make every effort to bring the other also to the same space, to the same meditative mind, and the other will be grateful, not offended. But these are not the moments when you should depart from each other. These are the moments when you should keep – with every effort – the contact with the other, with as much compassion as possible. Because if love cannot help the other in transforming the animal energies into higher spiritual energies, then your love is not love – not worth calling love.\nGyan Atito, this is the situation many are passing through. But very few have the courage to ask the question, because it seems asking such a question is exposing yourself unnecessarily, becoming a laughingstock. But this gathering is to expose yourself. This gathering is not to hide and keep secrets to yourself. Nobody is your enemy here. Everybody is a fellow traveler.\nAnd the same problems are going to be faced and encountered by everyone. So when a problem arises, never think twice. Ask it fearlessly, howsoever stupid you look in asking it. Because it is going to help not only you; it is going to help many others who are also struggling in the same situation, but have not been courageous enough to bring it forth. They are trying on their own, somehow, to settle the situation.\nIt is not a question of settling. It is good that it has lost its old, settled state. It is good that it is unsettled, that trouble has arisen. Now it depends on you and on your intelligence, how you use the opportunity – in favor of your growth, or against it. Asking the question may help you.\nSo two things... first, remember you are fortunate that sex seems to be going away from your life. Secondly, don’t think that the other person is feeling offended. Expose your heart to the other person. Don’t try to bring yourself to the position of the other, but try in every possible way to hold the hand of the other, and take her, or him, to the higher stage, where you are suddenly finding yourself.\nOnly in the beginning will it be difficult; soon it will become very easy. When there are two persons growing together, many times gaps will arise because people cannot keep pace with each other; everybody has his own speed, everybody has his own unique growth pattern. But if you love, you can wait a little till the other arrives, and then, hand in hand, you can move further.\nI want my people particularly not to think ever of celibacy. If celibacy comes by itself, that’s another matter; you are not responsible for it. And then it will never bring any perversion, then it will bring a great conversion of energies.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nCAN INNOCENCE BE AWARE OF ITSELF?\nManeesha, innocence cannot be aware of itself. The moment it is aware of itself, it is no longer innocent; corruption has already entered in, the ego has started forming itself. Innocence does not know that it is innocent. Innocence simply knows, “I don’t know.” But it is not aware that this is called “innocence”; the moment it becomes aware, suddenly it is lost. Hence those who are aware of their innocence are the greatest egoists in the world.\nThe ego has such subtle ways, that it goes on coming from the back door... you may throw it out from the front door, and it will come from the back door again. And each time it will come in such a way that you cannot hear its footsteps. It can come and hide itself in humbleness, it can come and hide itself in innocence, it can come and hide itself in love. Basically, these are not the spaces where ego should be found. But ego can manage to live in places where ordinarily it is not suspected. Hence one has to be very alert.\nYou simply become more silent. Your so-called knowledge goes on disappearing – and a moment comes: you know nothing. This state of knowing nothing is enough. You don’t make it a great spiritual achievement; you don’t start bragging about your innocence, that “I know nothing.” Before,\nyou used to know all, that was your bragging. Now your bragging is the same, but you brag that you know nothing at all. Just the object of bragging has changed, but the ego remains the same. There has been no transformation at all.\nLittle Hymie was caught out telling a lie. “How do you expect to get to heaven?” his mother asked.\nLittle Hymie thought for a moment, and then said, “Well, I will just run in and out, and in and out, and in and out, and keep slamming the door, till they say, ‘For goodness sake, come in or stay out’ – and then I will go in.”\nThis is innocence – not aware about itself, but simple purity. Innocence has to be just like a small child who is not aware that not knowing anything is a great achievement.\nMrs. Ronald Reagan had won a raffle at her women’s club. Up till now she never had enough left over from the housekeeping budget to take herself off to a smart hairdresser. So now she lost no time in making an appointment for a complete hair treatment. When she arrived home that evening, she presented herself to Ronald Reagan for his admiration. “Honey,” he said, “now you look like a million.”\n“Really?” she asked quietly. “You mean I look like a million dollars?” “No,” he said disgustedly, “like a million other women.”\nA politician’s mind cannot be loving and compassionate, humble and innocent – even with those with whom he is intimately connected. There too it goes on playing the cunning role – now he was speaking in a diplomatic way when he said, “Honey, now you look like a million.” This sentence is cunning, political, diplomatic; it is tricky.\nNaturally, his wife thinks, “You mean I look like a million dollars?” And then his cunning mind comes into the open:\n“No,” he said disgustedly, “like a million other women.”\nYou would not have thought about it just listening to his statement, “Honey, now you look like a million.”\nThe innocent person is neither cunning nor egoistic; not bragging about himself nor trying to put down the other. He simply knows nothing. And without any fear, and without any guilt, he accepts his ignorance.\nThere are two possibilities: either he can feel guilty that he is ignorant – because innocence is ignorance – and if he feels guilty, that too is part of a hurt ego, offended ego. Or if he has heard saints and sages declaring, “Blessed are the innocent, for they shall inherit the kingdom of God,” and he feels tremendously proud of his innocence, again he is in the clutches of the same ego. And these are the only two ways he can be aware of his innocence.\nThe third space is, he simply knows that he knows nothing. This is pure innocence, and this is what Socrates calls wisdom; this is what Upanishads call the ultimate state of a seer, of a knower. This is\nwhat Gautam Buddha calls the space of enlightenment, of absolute freedom and utter silence... not even a ripple of disturbance.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nTHE TIMES I FEEL CLOSEST TO YOU, AND THROUGH YOU, THE TIMES THAT I FEEL THIS EXISTENCE, COME TO ME IN AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF GRATITUDE. FOR THOSE PRECIOUS MOMENTS, ALL MY NEUROSES JUST EVAPORATE.\nCAN YOU SPEAK ON THE ALCHEMY OF GRATEFULNESS?\nDeva Abhiyana, gratefulness is certainly the most precious alchemical process. If it takes possession of you, then naturally all kinds of neuroses, psychoses, or any other psychopathology will evaporate – for the simple reason that gratefulness consists of a few fundamentals of spiritual awakening.\nThe first: that you are needed by existence. Man’s greatest need is to be needed. And if you can feel that even trees, the moon, the sun and the stars all need you... without you this existence will miss something, will not be complete – although you are so small, almost nothing. But unless you were needed, you would not have been here. There must be some essential need which you are fulfilling; without you there would be a gap which nobody else could fill.\nYou are not replaceable. No man is, no rosebush is, no blade of grass is – nothing in the world is replaceable. Such unique individuality has been conferred on you. This is the first element which brings gratefulness to your heart.\nThe second... that you are so unworthy, so undeserving, you have done nothing to have this dignity to be part of this beautiful existence. The feeling of your nothingness, the feeling of your being almost a nobody... still, the existence goes on showering its love. Not that you deserve, not that you have earned it in any way – but it is simply the nature of existence, its overflowing joy, its overflowing love, its overflowing nourishment, its playfulness. And it goes on giving without asking anything in return. Its greatness, its vastness... our smallness, our nothingness. Its abundance and our nobodiness immediately create a deep, heartfelt feeling of gratitude.\nThis feeling brings immense grace to you; it brings beauty, it brings a certain song to your being. It suddenly gives you wings to fly in the sky. Just the sheer miracle of it – that you are nothing and the whole existence is available with all its treasures to you. It is unbelievable – what can you do? You don’t have anything of your own except to be in deep gratitude.\nTo me, this is the only prayer. All other prayers are manufactured by man. This is the only prayer – that arises out of you as a fragrance arises from flowers; a prayer that is not said, not expressed in words, but is lived. It is expressed in each of your actions, in each of your gestures. You have a tremendous reverence for life; out of this reverence nonviolence arises. Out of this reverence a love for peace and a rebelliousness against all war and all destruction arises. This prayer is nothing but a silent “thank you.” But its alchemical impact on your being is immeasurable.\nAbhiyana, you are asking: “The times I feel closest to you, and through you, the times that I feel this existence, come to me in an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. For those precious moments, all my neuroses just evaporate.”\nEverybody is suffering from some kind of neurosis. Until one is enlightened, one should remember that he cannot be totally sane. Some insanity, in some corner of his being, is bound to be there. But if you feel a deep gratitude towards existence, in that gratitude you are cleaned and washed away – you are no more. And when you are no more, where can your neurosis remain? You are absolutely needed if you want your neurosis to exist. Your neurosis is nothing but the shadow of your ego. And in gratitude the ego disappears and its shadow disappears automatically.\nThe crowded elevator in an old New York building refused to budge. The operator opened and closed the gates and pressed the buttons several times, but still the lift refused to budge. Then he again opened the lift, and a very little, old lady got out.\nPresto! the elevator began to ascend, but not before the passengers heard the little old lady exclaim: “It is not that I weigh so much, but it is that I have so much on my mind today.”\nThat mind is your neurosis. And everybody has so much – that is your weight. That old woman was right. In gratitude your mind is no more... because the mind can exist with doubt, the mind can exist with anger, the mind can exist with hate, the mind can exist with any kind of neurosis. But the mind cannot exist with innocence, with humbleness, with gratitude, with love, with meditation. And wherever mind is absent, you are sane. Mind is your insanity.\nAnd the alchemy of gratefulness is that it dissolves your mind, it evaporates your ego, it makes you absent in a sense and present in another sense... absent as a personality, and present as an individuality; absent as somebody, and present as nobody.\nHymie Goldberg was talking to a friend: “It is not easy to get ahead in this world,” he said. “As a boy I started out at the bottom. I struggled, worked, sweated, climbing the ladder of life hand over hand, rung by rung.”\n“And now?” asked his friend, “you are a great success?”\n“Well, no,” admitted Goldberg, “but I’m mighty good at climbing ladders.”\nWhat is your success, anyway? It makes you mighty good at climbing ladders. What else can it be? You can be a president of a country, or a prime minister of a country, but what is it? In actuality it is nothing but an exercise in climbing a ladder – hand over hand, rung by rung. But where do you reach? – at the top of the ladder. And there is nothing, there comes the end of the street. You cannot go back because that is embarrassing; you cannot go forward because there is no further.\nI was very close to a chief minister. His sons had been my colleagues in the university, and because of them I had become acquainted with the old man. He was an old freedom fighter and he told me one day... he was very sick, and there was a danger that he might die. Doctors were not certain whether he would survive or not.\nBut the old man said, “Make sure that whether I am sick or healthy, that I remain the chief minister. I want to die as chief minister. It will be too hard for me to die if my chief ministership is gone.”\nI said, “What does it matter to a man who is going to die whether he is chief minister or not?”\nHe said, “It matters, it matters much. My whole life I have struggled to reach this post, and I want to die at the highest peak of my success, with government honors, seven-day holidays, national flags down everywhere in respect. I don’t want to die just like any ordinary man. I am not afraid of death,” that old man said to me, “but I am afraid that while I am sick, my colleagues – who deep down are all my enemies – must be trying to pull my legs; and while I am not able to fight with them, somebody may try to take over the chief ministership.”\nHis deputy chief minister was also known to me, because when I was a student he was vice- chancellor of that university. I said, “Don’t be worried. I will go to the deputy chief minister, who is the real danger to you, and who is trying not to miss the opportunity while you are sick. He wants to be declared by the president of the country to be the acting chief minister. That will be the first step.\n“Then the second step will be that because you are too old and too sick, you are not able to function, you are not in a state to function... then he will manage to be declared not only as acting chief minister but really as chief minister. I will go to him, you don’t be worried.”\nAnd that’s what was going on in the house of the deputy chief minister. The whole cabinet was there – they were all trying to manipulate the situation. How to convince the president of the country that the old chief minister is too old and too sick, and the deputy chief minister is a far more intelligent politician, a better organizer, and he should be given the chance immediately.\nI told the deputy chief minister, “That old man is almost on the verge of death, and I want you just to wait at least one week – not more than that. I have talked to his doctor; he says, ‘I cannot say it to them, but I don’t think he will survive more than a week.’ And his only desire, his last desire, is to die as the chief minister. So what? And you have always been a colleague, a friend, a follower of that old man. He has appointed you as the deputy chief minister. Just wait for seven days. You will not lose anything, but his last wish will be fulfilled.”\nHe thought for a moment, and said, “Okay. Then seven days – exactly.”\nI said, “Do you mean I have to kill him in seven days? I will try. But you should not be so ugly and so harsh with your own boss. Just one day more or one day less, but he is going to die – that much is certain. Now don’t force me to kill him to stay just within the seven days exactly. If he dies in eight days, just one day of waiting will not disturb anything.”\nHe said, “I have told you seven days means seven days. And just because you have come, I cannot refuse. I have always loved you as my student.” Fortunately, the old man died on the fourth day. It was such a relief! Otherwise I would have had to do something, because his last wish had to be fulfilled.…\nBut how poor these people are! And what is their ultimate achievement? They have just learned how to climb ladders, and then they are sitting on the ladders which lead nowhere. And they don’t want to come down because they don’t want to be nobodies.\nThese are the most irreligious people in the world. That’s why I’m so much against politicians. I am against the priests and the politicians because these two are the most irreligious people in the world. And they have a deep conspiracy, they support each other – for centuries they have been supporting each other. One has political power, the other has the power of numbers. And both together can manage to keep the whole of mankind in slavery; they have kept it up to now. The authentic religious man has to rebel against these two, and their conspiracy against humanity.\nAbhiyana, if you can remember as much as possible this state of gratitude, slowly slowly it will penetrate into your blood, into your bones, into your marrow. Then there will be no need to remember; then it will simply be there – like breathing, like heartbeats. Then you can be certain that you have arrived home. Now there is nowhere to go; you have achieved the unachievable, you have found the ultimate secret of life. Now you are not just a part of existence, but the whole of it.\nThe day one understands that “I am spread all over the existence, and when trees dance I am dancing, and when the wind blows and sings songs amongst the trees it is my song, and when the ocean rolls in the full-moon night I am not separate from it...” This is the moment mystics have been calling: when the observer becomes the observed, when the knower becomes the known, when the seer becomes the seen, when the duality between subject and object disappears, when you are the world.\nThe Upanishads say: aham brahmasmi – I am the whole. This is not a declaration of ego, it is a declaration of absolute egolessness. This is the path – the pathless path; or the gate – the gateless gate. You don’t have to go anywhere, you don’t have to move even a single inch. You can relax right now and it is yours. It has always been yours, you have just been asleep.\nAwake and claim your birthright. Religion is not anybody’s monopoly, it is everybody’s birthright. It has no name, no church, no organization. It is a sheer rebellion against all churches, all organizations, all scriptures. It is meeting existence directly and immediately, in innocence, in gratitude, in love, in a deep communion.\nThis is the prayer I would like to spread all over the earth.

NOT THAT I DON’T WANT SEX
AND THAT I AM NOT COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO APPROACH WOMEN, BUT IT JUST
DOESN’T HAPPEN.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I APPROACH A WOMAN LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL ENERGY IS FLOWING, BUT WHEN
IT COMES TO SEX, THE ENERGY CHANGES. IT ALMOST FEELS AS IF FALLING
ASLEEP. WHEN I THEN TRY TO GET IT GOING AGAIN, THE WOMAN FEELS OFFENDED;
SHE DOESN’T FEEL CONNECTED ANY MORE, AND FEELS THAT I AM NOT ACCEPTING
HER SPACE. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, CAN YOU HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND?</p><p><br></p><p>Gyan Atito, what is happening to you is not a curse; it is a
blessing. It is just your old mind that is interpreting it as if
something is going wrong. Everything is going right, the way it should
go. Sex has to disappear into a peaceful, playful rejoicing – into a
harmony of two silent beings; not meeting in their bodies, but meeting
in their very souls.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to happen to every sannyasin. Don’t force yourself to do
anything against what is happening on its own accord. Any forcing on
your part will be a hindrance in your spiritual growth.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something very important to remember, and this will explain
to you why all the religions have gone against sex. It was a
misunderstanding – but a very natural misunderstanding. Everybody</p><p>who has been in meditation goes through the transformation of the
energies – the energies that are going downward start moving upward,
opening your higher centers of consciousness, bringing new skies to your
being. But you are unacquainted with them, they are unknown to you;
hence, one may get frightened. And if it is happening only to one
partner, then there is going to be trouble. Both the partners in
meditation have to be transforming simultaneously – only then can they
keep pace with each other. Otherwise they are going to fall apart.</p><p><br></p><p>This created the idea of celibacy. Because in marriage it was found
continuously that if one partner became interested in meditation, the
marriage was jeopardized. It was better not to get involved, not to hurt
somebody else’s feelings, and remain alone. But this was a wrong
decision.</p><p><br></p><p>The right decision would have been that if one partner in a marriage
or in a friendship is growing, he should help the other also to move
into the new spaces. He should not leave the other partner behind. This
would have been a tremendous revolution in human consciousness; but
because religions had chosen celibacy, the whole world remained without
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And those who had chosen celibacy – it was a chosen thing, it had not
happened to them – became perverted sexually. They were not beyond sex,
hence celibacy. They tried the other way: celibacy first, thinking that
then would come the transformation. It does not work that way.
Transformation has to be first. Then, without any inhibition, without
fighting with sex, without condemning sex, a transformation comes on its
own. But it does not come by celibacy, it comes by meditation. And it
does not come by repression, it comes by a loving atmosphere. The
celibate lives in an atmosphere of repression, inhibition, perversion;
his whole atmosphere is psychologically sick. This was one fundamental
point where all religions went wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, every meditator has found that sex starts disappearing into
something tremendously different – from biology into something
spiritual. Rather than creating a bondage, a possessiveness, it opens up
doors of freedom. All relationships disappear and one feels, in his
aloneness, absolute contentment; a fulfillment that one could not even
have dreamed of.</p><p><br></p><p>But because meditators found this happening, without any exception,
the people who wanted to meditate inferred wrongly that perhaps
repressing sex is going to help them in transforming their energies.
Hence all organized religions started teaching a life of condemnation,
renunciation; a life which is basically negative. This was a
misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Through repressing sex you can pervert the energy but you cannot
convert it. Conversion comes as you become more silent, as your heart
becomes more harmonious, as your mind becomes more and more peaceful. As
you start coming closer and closer to your being, to your very center, a
transformation that is not your doing happens on its own accord. The
energy that you had known as sexual becomes your very spirituality. It
is the same energy, just the direction has changed. It is not going
downward, it is moving upward.</p><p><br></p><p>What is happening to you, Gyan Atito, is going to happen to every
sannyasin – without exception. Hence your question is going to be
everybody’s question sooner or later. And whenever it happens, the
partner who is left behind should not feel offended but on the contrary,
should feel blissful and happy that at least to his beloved, or to his
friend, a beautiful experience is happening, “And I hope to join him or
her as soon as possible.”</p><p>Your effort should be to go deeper into meditation so you can keep
company with your partner, and you can go on dancing together towards
the ultimate goal of life. But remember, as you will grow in your
spirituality your sexuality is going to disappear. There will be a new
kind of love – a purity, a deep innocence, with no possessiveness, with
no jealousy; but with all the compassion in the world, to help each
other in the inner growth.</p><p><br></p><p>So you should not feel that something has gone wrong with you;
something has suddenly gone right with you. You were not alert; you have
been caught unawares.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Hymie was walking along the street with little Betty, aged
four. As they were about to cross the street, little Hymie remembered
his mother’s teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me hold your hand,” he offered gallantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” replied Betty. “But I want you to know you are playing with
fire.”</p><p><br></p><p>Any relationship between man and woman is playing with fire – and
particularly if you also start being a meditator. Then you are
surrounded by a wildfire, because so many changes are going to happen –
for which you are not prepared, and cannot be prepared. You are going to
travel in an unknown territory every moment, every day. And there will
be many times when either you will be left behind, or your partner will
be left behind – and this will be a deep anguish to both.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning, when it starts, the natural inference will be that
the relationship is finished, that you are no more in love. Certainly
you are no more in the love that you were before – that old love is no
longer possible. That was animal love, it is good that it is gone. Now a
higher quality, something more divine, is going to take place. But you
have to help each other.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the real difficult times – when you come to know whether
you love your partner, and whether your partner loves you – when these
great gaps arise between you and you feel you are going far away from
each other. These are the crucial moments, a fire test, when you should
try to bring the other person, who is left behind, closer to you. You
should help the other person to be meditative.</p><p><br></p><p>The natural idea will be to bring yourself down so the other is not
offended. That’s an absolutely wrong attitude. You are not helping the
other, you are hurting yourself. A good opportunity is being lost. When
you could have pulled the other towards heights, you have descended
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried that the other will be offended. You make every
effort to bring the other also to the same space, to the same meditative
mind, and the other will be grateful, not offended. But these are not
the moments when you should depart from each other. These are the
moments when you should keep – with every effort – the contact with the
other, with as much compassion as possible. Because if love cannot help
the other in transforming the animal energies into higher spiritual
energies, then your love is not love – not worth calling love.</p><p><br></p><p>Gyan Atito, this is the situation many are passing through. But very
few have the courage to ask the question, because it seems asking such a
question is exposing yourself unnecessarily, becoming a laughingstock.
But this gathering is to expose yourself. This gathering is not to hide
and keep secrets to yourself. Nobody is your enemy here. Everybody is a
fellow traveler.</p><p>And the same problems are going to be faced and encountered by
everyone. So when a problem arises, never think twice. Ask it
fearlessly, howsoever stupid you look in asking it. Because it is going
to help not only you; it is going to help many others who are also
struggling in the same situation, but have not been courageous enough to
bring it forth. They are trying on their own, somehow, to settle the
situation.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of settling. It is good that it has lost its
old, settled state. It is good that it is unsettled, that trouble has
arisen. Now it depends on you and on your intelligence, how you use the
opportunity – in favor of your growth, or against it. Asking the
question may help you.</p><p><br></p><p>So two things... first, remember you are fortunate that sex seems to
be going away from your life. Secondly, don’t think that the other
person is feeling offended. Expose your heart to the other person. Don’t
try to bring yourself to the position of the other, but try in every
possible way to hold the hand of the other, and take her, or him, to the
higher stage, where you are suddenly finding yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Only in the beginning will it be difficult; soon it will become very
easy. When there are two persons growing together, many times gaps will
arise because people cannot keep pace with each other; everybody has his
own speed, everybody has his own unique growth pattern. But if you love,
you can wait a little till the other arrives, and then, hand in hand,
you can move further.</p><p><br></p><p>I want my people particularly not to think ever of celibacy. If
celibacy comes by itself, that’s another matter; you are not responsible
for it. And then it will never bring any perversion, then it will bring
a great conversion of energies.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>CAN INNOCENCE BE AWARE OF ITSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, innocence cannot be aware of itself. The moment it is aware
of itself, it is no longer innocent; corruption has already entered in,
the ego has started forming itself. Innocence does not know that it is
innocent. Innocence simply knows, “I don’t know.” But it is not aware
that this is called “innocence”; the moment it becomes aware, suddenly
it is lost. Hence those who are aware of their innocence are the
greatest egoists in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego has such subtle ways, that it goes on coming from the back
door... you may throw it out from the front door, and it will come from
the back door again. And each time it will come in such a way that you
cannot hear its footsteps. It can come and hide itself in humbleness, it
can come and hide itself in innocence, it can come and hide itself in
love. Basically, these are not the spaces where ego should be found. But
ego can manage to live in places where ordinarily it is not suspected.
Hence one has to be very alert.</p><p><br></p><p>You simply become more silent. Your so-called knowledge goes on
disappearing – and a moment comes: you know nothing. This state of
knowing nothing is enough. You don’t make it a great spiritual
achievement; you don’t start bragging about your innocence, that “I know
nothing.” Before,</p><p>you used to know all, that was your bragging. Now your bragging is
the same, but you brag that you know nothing at all. Just the object of
bragging has changed, but the ego remains the same. There has been no
transformation at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Hymie was caught out telling a lie. “How do you expect to get
to heaven?” his mother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Hymie thought for a moment, and then said, “Well, I will just
run in and out, and in and out, and in and out, and keep slamming the
door, till they say, ‘For goodness sake, come in or stay out’ – and then
I will go in.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is innocence – not aware about itself, but simple purity.
Innocence has to be just like a small child who is not aware that not
knowing anything is a great achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Ronald Reagan had won a raffle at her women’s club. Up till now
she never had enough left over from the housekeeping budget to take
herself off to a smart hairdresser. So now she lost no time in making an
appointment for a complete hair treatment. When she arrived home that
evening, she presented herself to Ronald Reagan for his admiration.
“Honey,” he said, “now you look like a million.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” she asked quietly. “You mean I look like a million
dollars?” “No,” he said disgustedly, “like a million other women.”</p><p>A politician’s mind cannot be loving and compassionate, humble and
innocent – even with those with whom he is intimately connected. There
too it goes on playing the cunning role – now he was speaking in a
diplomatic way when he said, “Honey, now you look like a million.” This
sentence is cunning, political, diplomatic; it is tricky.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, his wife thinks, “You mean I look like a million dollars?”
And then his cunning mind comes into the open:</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” he said disgustedly, “like a million other women.”</p><p><br></p><p>You would not have thought about it just listening to his statement,
“Honey, now you look like a million.”</p><p><br></p><p>The innocent person is neither cunning nor egoistic; not bragging
about himself nor trying to put down the other. He simply knows nothing.
And without any fear, and without any guilt, he accepts his
ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two possibilities: either he can feel guilty that he is
ignorant – because innocence is ignorance – and if he feels guilty, that
too is part of a hurt ego, offended ego. Or if he has heard saints and
sages declaring, “Blessed are the innocent, for they shall inherit the
kingdom of God,” and he feels tremendously proud of his innocence, again
he is in the clutches of the same ego. And these are the only two ways
he can be aware of his innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>The third space is, he simply knows that he knows nothing. This is
pure innocence, and this is what Socrates calls wisdom; this is what
Upanishads call the ultimate state of a seer, of a knower. This is</p><p>what Gautam Buddha calls the space of enlightenment, of absolute
freedom and utter silence... not even a ripple of disturbance.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>THE TIMES I FEEL CLOSEST TO YOU, AND THROUGH YOU, THE TIMES THAT I
FEEL THIS EXISTENCE, COME TO ME IN AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF GRATITUDE.
FOR THOSE PRECIOUS MOMENTS, ALL MY NEUROSES JUST EVAPORATE.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU SPEAK ON THE ALCHEMY OF GRATEFULNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Abhiyana, gratefulness is certainly the most precious alchemical
process. If it takes possession of you, then naturally all kinds of
neuroses, psychoses, or any other psychopathology will evaporate – for
the simple reason that gratefulness consists of a few fundamentals of
spiritual awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>The first: that you are needed by existence. Man’s greatest need is
to be needed. And if you can feel that even trees, the moon, the sun and
the stars all need you... without you this existence will miss
something, will not be complete – although you are so small, almost
nothing. But unless you were needed, you would not have been here. There
must be some essential need which you are fulfilling; without you there
would be a gap which nobody else could fill.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not replaceable. No man is, no rosebush is, no blade of grass
is – nothing in the world is replaceable. Such unique individuality has
been conferred on you. This is the first element which brings
gratefulness to your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>The second... that you are so unworthy, so undeserving, you have done
nothing to have this dignity to be part of this beautiful existence. The
feeling of your nothingness, the feeling of your being almost a
nobody... still, the existence goes on showering its love. Not that you
deserve, not that you have earned it in any way – but it is simply the
nature of existence, its overflowing joy, its overflowing love, its
overflowing nourishment, its playfulness. And it goes on giving without
asking anything in return. Its greatness, its vastness... our smallness,
our nothingness. Its abundance and our nobodiness immediately create a
deep, heartfelt feeling of gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>This feeling brings immense grace to you; it brings beauty, it brings
a certain song to your being. It suddenly gives you wings to fly in the
sky. Just the sheer miracle of it – that you are nothing and the whole
existence is available with all its treasures to you. It is unbelievable
– what can you do? You don’t have anything of your own except to be in
deep gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, this is the only prayer. All other prayers are manufactured by
man. This is the only prayer – that arises out of you as a fragrance
arises from flowers; a prayer that is not said, not expressed in words,
but is lived. It is expressed in each of your actions, in each of your
gestures. You have a tremendous reverence for life; out of this
reverence nonviolence arises. Out of this reverence a love for peace and
a rebelliousness against all war and all destruction arises. This prayer
is nothing but a silent “thank you.” But its alchemical impact on your
being is immeasurable.</p><p>Abhiyana, you are asking: “The times I feel closest to you, and
through you, the times that I feel this existence, come to me in an
overwhelming feeling of gratitude. For those precious moments, all my
neuroses just evaporate.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is suffering from some kind of neurosis. Until one is
enlightened, one should remember that he cannot be totally sane. Some
insanity, in some corner of his being, is bound to be there. But if you
feel a deep gratitude towards existence, in that gratitude you are
cleaned and washed away – you are no more. And when you are no more,
where can your neurosis remain? You are absolutely needed if you want
your neurosis to exist. Your neurosis is nothing but the shadow of your
ego. And in gratitude the ego disappears and its shadow disappears
automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowded elevator in an old New York building refused to budge.
The operator opened and closed the gates and pressed the buttons several
times, but still the lift refused to budge. Then he again opened the
lift, and a very little, old lady got out.</p><p><br></p><p>Presto! the elevator began to ascend, but not before the passengers
heard the little old lady exclaim: “It is not that I weigh so much, but
it is that I have so much on my mind today.”</p><p><br></p><p>That mind is your neurosis. And everybody has so much – that is your
weight. That old woman was right. In gratitude your mind is no more...
because the mind can exist with doubt, the mind can exist with anger,
the mind can exist with hate, the mind can exist with any kind of
neurosis. But the mind cannot exist with innocence, with humbleness,
with gratitude, with love, with meditation. And wherever mind is absent,
you are sane. Mind is your insanity.</p><p><br></p><p>And the alchemy of gratefulness is that it dissolves your mind, it
evaporates your ego, it makes you absent in a sense and present in
another sense... absent as a personality, and present as an
individuality; absent as somebody, and present as nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Hymie Goldberg was talking to a friend: “It is not easy to get ahead
in this world,” he said. “As a boy I started out at the bottom. I
struggled, worked, sweated, climbing the ladder of life hand over hand,
rung by rung.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And now?” asked his friend, “you are a great success?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, no,” admitted Goldberg, “but I’m mighty good at climbing
ladders.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is your success, anyway? It makes you mighty good at climbing
ladders. What else can it be? You can be a president of a country, or a
prime minister of a country, but what is it? In actuality it is nothing
but an exercise in climbing a ladder – hand over hand, rung by rung. But
where do you reach? – at the top of the ladder. And there is nothing,
there comes the end of the street. You cannot go back because that is
embarrassing; you cannot go forward because there is no further.</p><p><br></p><p>I was very close to a chief minister. His sons had been my colleagues
in the university, and because of them I had become acquainted with the
old man. He was an old freedom fighter and he told me one day... he was
very sick, and there was a danger that he might die. Doctors were not
certain whether he would survive or not.</p><p>But the old man said, “Make sure that whether I am sick or healthy,
that I remain the chief minister. I want to die as chief minister. It
will be too hard for me to die if my chief ministership is gone.”</p><p>I said, “What does it matter to a man who is going to die whether he
is chief minister or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It matters, it matters much. My whole life I have struggled
to reach this post, and I want to die at the highest peak of my success,
with government honors, seven-day holidays, national flags down
everywhere in respect. I don’t want to die just like any ordinary man. I
am not afraid of death,” that old man said to me, “but I am afraid that
while I am sick, my colleagues – who deep down are all my enemies – must
be trying to pull my legs; and while I am not able to fight with them,
somebody may try to take over the chief ministership.”</p><p>His deputy chief minister was also known to me, because when I was a
student he was vice- chancellor of that university. I said, “Don’t be
worried. I will go to the deputy chief minister, who is the real danger
to you, and who is trying not to miss the opportunity while you are
sick. He wants to be declared by the president of the country to be the
acting chief minister. That will be the first step.</p><p>“Then the second step will be that because you are too old and too
sick, you are not able to function, you are not in a state to
function... then he will manage to be declared not only as acting chief
minister but really as chief minister. I will go to him, you don’t be
worried.”</p><p>And that’s what was going on in the house of the deputy chief
minister. The whole cabinet was there – they were all trying to
manipulate the situation. How to convince the president of the country
that the old chief minister is too old and too sick, and the deputy
chief minister is a far more intelligent politician, a better organizer,
and he should be given the chance immediately.</p><p>I told the deputy chief minister, “That old man is almost on the
verge of death, and I want you just to wait at least one week – not more
than that. I have talked to his doctor; he says, ‘I cannot say it to
them, but I don’t think he will survive more than a week.’ And his only
desire, his last desire, is to die as the chief minister. So what? And
you have always been a colleague, a friend, a follower of that old man.
He has appointed you as the deputy chief minister. Just wait for seven
days. You will not lose anything, but his last wish will be
fulfilled.”</p><p>He thought for a moment, and said, “Okay. Then seven days –
exactly.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Do you mean I have to kill him in seven days? I will try.
But you should not be so ugly and so harsh with your own boss. Just one
day more or one day less, but he is going to die – that much is certain.
Now don’t force me to kill him to stay just within the seven days
exactly. If he dies in eight days, just one day of waiting will not
disturb anything.”</p><p>He said, “I have told you seven days means seven days. And just
because you have come, I cannot refuse. I have always loved you as my
student.” Fortunately, the old man died on the fourth day. It was such a
relief! Otherwise I would have had to do something, because his last
wish had to be fulfilled.…</p><p>But how poor these people are! And what is their ultimate
achievement? They have just learned how to climb ladders, and then they
are sitting on the ladders which lead nowhere. And they don’t want to
come down because they don’t want to be nobodies.</p><p>These are the most irreligious people in the world. That’s why I’m so
much against politicians. I am against the priests and the politicians
because these two are the most irreligious people in the world. And they
have a deep conspiracy, they support each other – for centuries they
have been supporting each other. One has political power, the other has
the power of numbers. And both together can manage to keep the whole of
mankind in slavery; they have kept it up to now. The authentic religious
man has to rebel against these two, and their conspiracy against
humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Abhiyana, if you can remember as much as possible this state of
gratitude, slowly slowly it will penetrate into your blood, into your
bones, into your marrow. Then there will be no need to remember; then it
will simply be there – like breathing, like heartbeats. Then you can be
certain that you have arrived home. Now there is nowhere to go; you have
achieved the unachievable, you have found the ultimate secret of life.
Now you are not just a part of existence, but the whole of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The day one understands that “I am spread all over the existence, and
when trees dance I am dancing, and when the wind blows and sings songs
amongst the trees it is my song, and when the ocean rolls in the
full-moon night I am not separate from it...” This is the moment mystics
have been calling: when the observer becomes the observed, when the
knower becomes the known, when the seer becomes the seen, when the
duality between subject and object disappears, when you are the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say: aham brahmasmi – I am the whole. This is not a
declaration of ego, it is a declaration of absolute egolessness. This is
the path – the pathless path; or the gate – the gateless gate. You don’t
have to go anywhere, you don’t have to move even a single inch. You can
relax right now and it is yours. It has always been yours, you have just
been asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Awake and claim your birthright. Religion is not anybody’s monopoly,
it is everybody’s birthright. It has no name, no church, no
organization. It is a sheer rebellion against all churches, all
organizations, all scriptures. It is meeting existence directly and
immediately, in innocence, in gratitude, in love, in a deep
communion.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the prayer I would like to spread all over the earth. Because
this is the only prayer that can save it.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

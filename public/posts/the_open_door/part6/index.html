In the days of the Vedas they used to have that drug; it is a kind of lsd. Aldous Huxley has imagined that in the future when the ultimate lsd has been discovered it will be called soma. The word comes from moon. Som means moon and soma means the juice that comes from the moon and which is caught by certain herbs. Those herbs have been lost. Much research has been done but nobody has been able to find them.\nMy own understanding is this, that it was not a herb to be found outside in the Himalayas; it was just symbolic of the inner possibility. It was not an lsd outside; it was to be created in the lab of the body itself, that’s why it has not been found anywhere. And why the word has been derived from’moon’ is not accidental.\nMan’s intuitive energies are very deeply connected with the moon. Man’s reason is connected with the sun; man’s intuition is connected with the moon. And it is not only the ocean that is affected by the moon; all beings on the earth, trees and animals and birds and man are affected. The moon creates a kind of pulsation.\nMany more people go mad on the full-moon night than on any other night. Many more people commit suicide on the full moon than any other night. Many more people have become enlightened on the full-moon night than on any other night. The English word ‘lunatic’ is good; it comes from the moon, the lunar. In all the languages of the world there are words for the mad which are derived from the moon.\nIf the moon can drive you mad then it can also drive you enlightened. The mad person is one who didn’t know what to do with that juice. The enlightened is one who knew the art to transform his madness into a new vision. And all enlightened people are mad in that sense. They are not ordinary, run of the mill, normal; they are abnormal. And all mad people have some quality which\nis lacking in the ordinary normal people. All mad people are happy people and they have a certain approach to their intuitive faculty.\nSo my understanding is that soma is not to be found somewhere in the Himalayas. It is not a herb; it is not like marijuana, it is not even like LSD. It is the ultimate state of samadhi. It is the explosion of your moon energy. And you have great possibilities for that happening. The energy is just waiting. It just needs a small push and you will explode in dance, in song.\nSo while you are here remember that: the soma has to be created inside, the soma has to be released inside. Meditate more and more on the moon. Whenever there is a moon, dance under it. Have a dialogue with the moon, a little chitchat. Go mad with the moon and that will help you immensely. You belong to the moon.…\n[A sannyasin says he is in a relationship with the girl who has just taken sannyas.]\nThat’s very good! Go into her deeper and let her go deep into you. People love but they don’t go deep. With depth there arises fear. One goes only so far. Watch! If you go only so far something will remain unfinished, incomplete and will create irritation, will create anger. That’s why lovers go on fighting. The fight arises because something remains incomplete and that incomplete thing is a constant pressure. In nature everything wants to become complete; once it is complete the tension dissolves. Unless it is complete the tension cannot dissolve. The tension exists only so it can become complete. It is a kind of goading, it is a whip.\nPeople who are in love are continuously fighting; that simply shows that they are angry at each other, as if the other is not allowing it to happen. But it is not the other, it is you, it is always you. You must be stopping somewhere. When you stop the other stops, and it is a vicious circle. One should go wholeheartedly, utterly, like a madman, like a fool. If you remain wise and yet loving, your love will never become a fulfillment. Only fools can afford to love, but love brings a new kind of wisdom which is higher than the so-called wisdom. Love brings a new kind of knowledge and a new kind of knowing.\nYes, the heart has its own reasons that the head is completely unaware of, but one should go to the very end. So go deep – she is a beautiful woman – and allow her to go deep into you. Something is possible.…\nWhen two persons can really go into love, something is always possible. Nothing is impossible for love!\n[A sannyasin says: There’s a pressure in me of needs, as if there are desires there that have never been fulfilled... really right through my body.\nOsho checks her energy.]\nTell me a few things: first, how is your orgasm?\n[She answers: Some of the time it’s there but it’s not very total.]\nIt cannot be total, and when it is there then too I don’t think it is very intense. It is just lukewarm, it is not wild. You need a wild orgasm to release all the blocks. There is nothing else that will be of help except a good orgasmic flow that simply comes like a flood and takes all the blocks and all the rubbish away. One of the greatest problems facing humanity is orgasm.\nAlmost ninety-five percent of people are non-orgasmic. Their energy has gone into the head, has become split, fragmentary and they have lost the way to find an orgasmic state. And once you are lost to the orgasmic state, your state is that of a person who cannot sleep. Then problems are bound to arise, because that deep sleep every day is a must to have contact again with yoUr source of energy.\nSleep brings you to the source of your biological energy, to the physiological sleep. Sleep is more a need of the body. Orgasm is more a need of the mind. Just as sleep is needed for a healthy body, orgasm is needed for a healthy mind. As sleep takes you deep into your source, orgasm takes you even deeper. And the third state is samadhi; that is the need of the soul. That also takes you, that takes you the deepest. Sleep takes you to a point where the body feels rejuvenated. Orgasm takes you to a point where the mind feels rejuvenated and fresh and young and flowing again. Samadhi takes you to the very centre of existence where resurrection is not only rejuvenation, from where you are reborn again.\nYou need a good orgasmic flow, so just a few things have to be remembered. One: before making love, dance. you can dance with your friend, good, have a good dance. Become as pulsating as possible, and dance pulsates. It need not be formal, it should not be really formal: it should be just a wild dance. To fulfill that need a few people have become masochistic or sadistic, because that too gives a pulsation.\nThere are people who would like to beat the woman before they can make love, or would like to be beaten by the woman before they can love. That beating, whipping, gives them a pulsation, a radiation; the energy starts moving. Then they can go deeper into orgasm, otherwise they cannot. And it is almost a universal phenomenon that a husband and wife fight before they make love a pillow fight or something. That gives a good flow. But these are foolish things, ugly things, and destructive.\n[Osho suggests that she dance or do Dynamic meditation before entering into sex. He tells her to let the body pulsate and throb with energy, not to be passive or shy. Lose control, moan, groan, cry, laugh, allow it and that will make your body capable of having a total orgasm. That will remove your blocks, your tensions and pressures.]\nPrem means love, avida means knowing. Love knows, knowledge only pretends. The mind goes round and round, love goes direct to the very core of the matter. Intellect moves around and around and always goes on missing the real. Love never worries about the periphery, it simply goes to the centre. These are the two ways of knowing – the way of the head and the way of the heart, the way of logic and the way of love. Logic is perfectly adequate as far as matter is concerned. The moment consciousness arises, logic is simply inadequate. Only love is adequate to know that which goes beyond matter.\nIntellect creates science, feeling creates religion. And the problem encountering humanity is that we have become too obsessed with intellect. It is good as far as it goes, I am not against it, but it does\nnot go far enough. It touches only the insignificant; the significant remains beyond it. And without the significant, life has no meaning.\nScience will give us better houses, better cars, better technologies, better standards of living, but it cannot give us a significant life. It cannot give meaning to us. It cannot give us ecstasy. That is beyond it, that is just absurd for it; nothing like that exists.\nBut what is a better house and a better car and a better machine if the better man is missing? So we have to discover again, have to rediscover really, what love means and how love can become an authentic source of knowing. A totally different knowledge is utterly needed, urgently needed. If that knowledge is not released into the world we are going to commit suicide, a global suicide, because science has come to the very end of its possibilities, potentialities and man has lost all balance.\nThat is the meaning of... Prem Avida: a knowing that happens through love, that only happens through love, a kind of intimate knowing. Two lovers know each other. They may not be able to express what they know, but they know. They feel deep in their hearts that they know.\nKnowledge that comes through love is self-evident, it needs no other proof. Sannyas is an effort to know life through love, to know existence through love. Once you have your love functioning, existence starts having a new quality.\nThat quality is what divineness or godliness is. There is no God as such but everything is divine. That is possible only when the eyes of love open.\n[A sannyasin had previously written Osho a letter to say that during a group he was doing an exercise with a girl and he felt like strangling her.\nOsho checks his energy.] It is there, mm?\nYou must have hated your mother tremendously.\nSo it is there in the unconscious that you always wanted to kill your mother. You have been repressing, repressing, repressing, so now the desire is ready to kill any woman.\nBut it is good that you have come across it, otherwise there is a possibility that in a certain moment you can kill a woman.\nIt will be almost unconscious; you will not even be thinking about it. And you may even forget about it once you have done it because your conscious mind cannot believe that you can do such a thing. It will come from the unconscious, surround you, do its work and go back into the unconscious.\nIt is very good that now you are aware of it. Start doing one small thing. You can get a doll and start talking to it the way you used to talk to your mother. For seven days make communication with the doll so that it becomes invested with the idea of your mother. But for seven days don’t hit the doll, don’t do anything nasty. First you have to become en rapport with it; call it Mum, or whatsoever\nyou used to call your mother. Be very respectful, as you used to be to your mother on the surface. Be very afraid of the doll and when it is in the room, enter the room in the same way as you used to when your mother was there. For seven days create this psychological atmosphere. After seven days, when yoU start feeling the presence of the mother, have a good fight.\nOn the eighth day say all those things that you always wanted to say and you never said. Get into a rage! And there is no hurry: go slowly so that the rage becomes really deep. Shout and scream! And then when the rage takes possession.… You are not to do it; it will happen when the rage takes possession.… You will strangle the doll, and that very moment it will be released from the unconscious. This is a kind of psychodrama that has to be enacted. Then only will women be safe from you, otherwise it is dangerous!\nAnd you will not kill any woman; you will kill only the woman who loves you really deeply. If this remains you will be afraid of love also. Because of this lingering idea you will be afraid of being alone with a woman in an intimate corner. You know this can happen so you will keep women away, distant. You can have a casual relationship but you will not go into a deep relationship.\nBut you can get rid of it. Find a really beautiful doll and first invest it with life for seven days, take every care. And this desire will be gone. When you have killed your mother, come back. I would like to look into your eyes again and see whether it is there or gone.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2351","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_door/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_door/>The Open Door</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2351 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Open_Door/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

to know that which goes beyond matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Intellect creates science, feeling creates religion. And the problem
encountering humanity is that we have become too obsessed with
intellect. It is good as far as it goes, I am not against it, but it
does</p><p><br></p><p>not go far enough. It touches only the insignificant; the significant
remains beyond it. And without the significant, life has no meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Science will give us better houses, better cars, better technologies,
better standards of living, but it cannot give us a significant life. It
cannot give meaning to us. It cannot give us ecstasy. That is beyond it,
that is just absurd for it; nothing like that exists.</p><p><br></p><p>But what is a better house and a better car and a better machine if
the better man is missing? So we have to discover again, have to
rediscover really, what love means and how love can become an authentic
source of knowing. A totally different knowledge is utterly needed,
urgently needed. If that knowledge is not released into the world we are
going to commit suicide, a global suicide, because science has come to
the very end of its possibilities, potentialities and man has lost all
balance.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of... Prem Avida: a knowing that happens through
love, that only happens through love, a kind of intimate knowing. Two
lovers know each other. They may not be able to express what they know,
but they know. They feel deep in their hearts that they know.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge that comes through love is self-evident, it needs no other
proof. Sannyas is an effort to know life through love, to know existence
through love. Once you have your love functioning, existence starts
having a new quality.</p><p><br></p><p>That quality is what divineness or godliness is. There is no God as
such but everything is divine. That is possible only when the eyes of
love open.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin had previously written Osho a letter to say that during
a group he was doing an exercise with a girl and he felt like strangling
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks his energy.] It is there, mm?</p><p>You must have hated your mother tremendously.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is there in the unconscious that you always wanted to kill your
mother. You have been repressing, repressing, repressing, so now the
desire is ready to kill any woman.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is good that you have come across it, otherwise there is a
possibility that in a certain moment you can kill a woman.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be almost unconscious; you will not even be thinking about
it. And you may even forget about it once you have done it because your
conscious mind cannot believe that you can do such a thing. It will come
from the unconscious, surround you, do its work and go back into the
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very good that now you are aware of it. Start doing one small
thing. You can get a doll and start talking to it the way you used to
talk to your mother. For seven days make communication with the doll so
that it becomes invested with the idea of your mother. But for seven
days don’t hit the doll, don’t do anything nasty. First you have to
become en rapport with it; call it Mum, or whatsoever</p><p><br></p><p>you used to call your mother. Be very respectful, as you used to be
to your mother on the surface. Be very afraid of the doll and when it is
in the room, enter the room in the same way as you used to when your
mother was there. For seven days create this psychological atmosphere.
After seven days, when yoU start feeling the presence of the mother,
have a good fight.</p><p><br></p><p>On the eighth day say all those things that you always wanted to say
and you never said. Get into a rage! And there is no hurry: go slowly so
that the rage becomes really deep. Shout and scream! And then when the
rage takes possession.… You are not to do it; it will happen when the
rage takes possession.… You will strangle the doll, and that very moment
it will be released from the unconscious. This is a kind of psychodrama
that has to be enacted. Then only will women be safe from you, otherwise
it is dangerous!</p><p><br></p><p>And you will not kill any woman; you will kill only the woman who
loves you really deeply. If this remains you will be afraid of love
also. Because of this lingering idea you will be afraid of being alone
with a woman in an intimate corner. You know this can happen so you will
keep women away, distant. You can have a casual relationship but you
will not go into a deep relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can get rid of it. Find a really beautiful doll and first
invest it with life for seven days, take every care. And this desire
will be gone. When you have killed your mother, come back. I would like
to look into your eyes again and see whether it is there or gone.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

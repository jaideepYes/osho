‌CHAPTER 1
1 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A visitor says she lives at Esalen Institute, a pioneer growth centre in california.] Mm mm, good! That is going to become my institute!
It will become! Become a sannyasin – that will help you to come close to me, because to come close something has to change inside you. Something that is a kind of no has to become yes; only then can you come to me.</description>

12 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[On 10th and 11th December there were no speaking darshans. The 11th was the birthday celebration, and the book contains a description of this.]
Anand means bliss, apta means one who has achieve – done who has achieved bliss. And this is the paradox – that the goal is already achieved before the journey has even started.</description>

[Osho gives sannyas to a woman.]
Raise your hands, close your eyes and feel like a tree, become a treeIt is sunny and windy and
the tree is delighted. whatsoever the tree feels to do, allow: if the tree sways in the wind it is okay.… Let me give sannyas to the tree! Just look at me as if you are a tree.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
14 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love and samadhan is the state where all questions and problems disappear. It is the state of mind where no question arises, a non-questioning state. It comes through love. It is only love that we never question, it is beyond question. We never ask, ‘Why am I in love? What is the purpose of love?</description>

15 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[Osho tells an initiate to raise his hands in a gesture of receptivity, to feel that great energy is pouring on him, showering on him in torrents. Be utterly absorbed by the energy, Osho continues, with no resistance, no control. If the energy starts moving, be moved.]
You have been seeking for many lives, now don’t miss the opportunity.</description>

16 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
[A sannyasin, returning to the West, says he has felt exhausted for years; here it seemed to become more intense.
Osho checks his energy.]
It is there and it must have been there for many years – maybe from your very birth. But you were not aware of it, that’s all. Tell me a few thingsOne is: how is your love relationship?</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
17 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Veet means beyond, dhamma means religion. I teach a religion which is beyond religions. I teach a religion which is religionless, because religions – Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism – have not helped. They have, on the contrary, been very great disasters to humanity. Now something is urgently needed which will not have any adjective to it, just pure religion.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
18 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, indu means splendour – divine splendour. And always think in that dimension – the dimension of splendour, beauty, blessing, benediction, the dimension of grace. If one can be full of the sense of beauty, one is full of God.
Aesthetics should be the only religion; poetry and dance should be the only prayer.</description>

[Osho gives a seeker sannyas:]
Come here. Close your eyes and feel as if you are dying. Lose control. Let me contact you at the moment of death, and whatsoever happens if death is coming, you have to allow it. If you fall to the floor, you fall to the.. whatsoever happens.
... Good!</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
20 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, ashu means quick – quick in love. And love is possible only if you are quick; life is possible only if you are quick. If you hesitate, you miss; if you brood, you miss, because time goes on flowing out of your hands – it does not wait.
If you are too much of a thinker you will go on missing all opportunities.</description>

‌CHAPTER 19
21 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, ragen means the king of the harmony or god of the harmony. Bliss is a harmony. When all your being, all parts of your being are functioning in tune, when there is no conflict, when you are not at war with yourself in any sense, when your mind, your body, your heart, are all together, on one wavelength, that is the state of bliss, that is harmony.</description>

[A couple are present. The man, known for his crazy behaviour, says that he’s been feeling crazier than ever, that he feels he’s been trying to prove something, that he’s consciously trying for something way out to happen.
Osho talks at length to him about only doing that which is true to his nature.</description>

[A sannyasin says she is continually making plans, having dreams, and how to stop?]
I will stop it; you just go on making, mm? They were there in the unconscious. That’s why I have given you the name, so that you become conscious about them. Once you become conscious about something which has been unconscious, it starts surfacing, and by surfacing it is released from your being.</description>

24 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, malik means god, lord – god of bliss, lord of bliss. Malik is a sufi name for God. ‘Ya Malik’ means ‘oh, Lord’. Sufis have ninety-nine names for God and one wonders why not one hundred; the list seems to be incomplete. The hundredth is the real name which cannot be uttered.</description>

‌CHAPTER 22
25 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Love knows how to forgive. Not only does one have to forgive others, one has to forgive oneself too, and that is the harder thing because we have been taught to feel guilty; we are burdened by guilt. A burdened man cannot grow and one who feels guilty feels always sick; he does not allow his wounds to heal.</description>

‌CHAPTER 23
26 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, giri means mountain – a bliss mountain.
And bliss has something to do with height, with plenitude. It takes you to the peaks, it takes you to the ultimate plenitude, beyond which one cannot go.
Bliss is the omega point, and everybody is seeking that peak. Sometimes one may be seeking a wrong way, may be moving in a cul-de-sac or may be thinking that one is going up and is actually going down, but still the unconscious desire is for the peak.</description>

‌CHAPTER 24
27 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Deva means divine, rashid means unerring quality. God is unerring, that is the meaning, and whatever mistakes happen in life, they happen because of us, not because of God. So never complain, and whenever you see something is going wrong, remember: it must be going wrong because of you.
Everything goes right if we surrender to God; everything settles, becomes harmonious.</description>

28 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, gaffar is a Sufi name for God. It means: one who forgives, love-forgiveness, that will be the whole meaning, or love-forgiveness. And that is one of the very fundamental secrets: if you can love and forgive, then nothing else is needed. If you cannot forgive, you cannot love; if you cannot love, you cannot forgive.</description>

30 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Anand means bliss, blissfulness, wahhab means one who can bestow bliss on others too. And bliss is true only when you can shower it on others, when you can share it. If it is something that you can’t share then you have imagined it, it is not true. Truth is always something that has to be shared, that can always be shared.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
3 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Veet means beyond, arthen means meaning – beyond meaning. Life is beyond meaning, being is beyond meaning. Meaning is a manufactured thing; it does not exist anywhere except in the mind. The whole of life is blissfully meaningless.It knows no purpose, no goal, no end. It is a perpetual play... just a play. Allow this seed to sink in your heart, that life is a play, not even a game; because in the game you start being serious.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
4 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, and avibha means burning from all sides, kindled from all sides.
People are very miserly in loving and living, and that’s why they are miserable. A miser is bound to remain miserable. Life is only for the quick and the spendthrift. Life is only for the extravagant... for those who can overflow, for those who are caring yet careless.</description>

Antar means inner, ayan means dimension – inner dimension. An evolution is nothing but evolution in the inner, in the interior. Evolution is a kind of interiority. The rock is there; it has no interior. It is all outside, it has no inside. There is no depth in it. It has no centre within it, the centre is missing.</description>

Deva means divine and soma is one of the most ancient drugs. In the days of the Vedas they used to have that drug; it is a kind of lsd. Aldous Huxley has imagined that in the future when the ultimate lsd has been discovered it will be called soma. The word comes from moon.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
7 December 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Prem means love, samveta means a chorus – a chorus of love. And love has to be a chorus; only then does it reach to its ultimate. It has to be a chorus of body, mind, soul. When all the three are involved, utterly involved, then only does one know what love is. Before that knowing, all is dreaming.</description>

But it is getting ready there; I can feel it in your heart, it is already there. There is no need to wait and see... be and see! That will be more relevant. How can you see from the outside?</description>

[A new sannyasin says: When I do Dynamic I always faint. The last time I had a hysterical fit and now I’m scared to death to do it.During the catharsis, during the fit, I saw myself falling over the
balcony. When I was a child I fell over the balcony, and I saw myself just falling over again, and I guess that’s what scared me.</description>

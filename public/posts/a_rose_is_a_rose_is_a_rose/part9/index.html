Something changes in the mind and, parallel to it, the body has to readjust, or if something changes in the body, the mind has to readjust. They both keep a very subtle harmony. So if you are in a certain state of mind, the body has a certain structure. When the mind changes, the body needs a new structure.\nAnd Rolfing is nothing but restructuring. It tries to melt the old musculature and helps the body to create new musculature. For example if a man is very angry, he has a certain musculature in the hands, in the arms, in the shoulders, in the teeth. An angry person is bound to have a very deep and subtle layer of tension in the jaw, in the teeth, in the hands. When you drop anger, or you release it, cathart it, suddenly there is no need for the old structure. So if you don’t do Rolfing, that old structure can exist for months, even for years. That old structure can force you into old ways, into old habits, even though the mind has changed, because the body has its own weight.\nMany times you do things and later on you say, ‘I did it in spite of myself.’ How can a person do something in spite of himself? But it happens. It happens because the body has its own way and sometimes it is too much. The mind knows it is wrong. The mind doesn’t want to do it, but the old habit is such that the body forces you and you are just pulled into the old habit.\nSo when the mind is really changing through meditation, Rolfing is a great support and it changes the structure very easily. But if the mind is not undergoing changes, then Rolfing is very painful because the mind is not ready and you are forcing the structure to change, and that structure has an existential necessity. Even if you do Rolfing, the body will accumulate the same tension again.\nFor a few days you will feel very good, but again, because the mind is still there, it will create its own field.\n[A visitor from the States said that she had done EST and had found it quite helpful.]\nIt can be very helpful. It is one of the most powerful things going in the West and very meaningful. Though it is not yet a complete system, it is a beginning and a good beginning...\nIt is just technology and a sort of brainwashing, but it is good if you can use it and you are not stuck in it; then it is very beneficial. If you get stuck in it, it can just be a wastage because the real thing is how to go beyond techniques and how to reach to love.\nAll techniques are good if they help you to go beyond, beyond them. Everything is good but basically it should make you capable of living your life from your innermost core. For example, a person is ill and you give him medicine. But medicine is not health, and if he becomes dependent on medicine, it is a new sort of illness. Sooner or later he has to drop the medicine. It is just to help his own healing powers. Once that healing power starts functioning, the medicine has to be reduced and dropped. But the real thing is to go beyond it and to find your own source.\nAll the techniques that are very prevalent in the West are just techniques. Techniques are good if they lead you to the heart, to love, to a flowering of your own innermost being. But one can get stuck in them, and there is every possibility for the modern mind to get stuck because the modern mind is technological. Mind as such is technological. So do a few meditations here.…\n[Another visitor said he had been with spiritual master who seemed to ‘possess’ him – he could feel his presence when he was alone meditating. He was still very confused about this.\nOsho checked his energy.]\nNothing was wrong in it. You simply became afraid. There is nothing like evil, but because you became afraid you interpreted it as if something was wrong. It always happens that if you become possessed by somebody’s presence – even if the presence is good – you feel very frightened because you are losing your own space. One feels good on the one hand because one’s being is being nourished. On the other hand one feels very much deprived because one’s freedom is lost..\nBut nothing was wrong in it. It happened naturally and it has helped you. Even the disconnecting was good, because if it was not disconnected, it may have killed your freedom. So it is good that you moved at the right time. This is a very subtle problem and the West is still not acquainted with it.\nA master has to work on the disciple in a very skillful way. He has to possess him but he has not to destroy his freedom. He has to nourish him but he has not to make him dependent. On one hand he has to help him to surrender and on the other he has to give him more will. The function of the master is very paradoxical. And this is the paradox: on one hand he says ‘Surrender’, and on the other hand he says ‘Beware of me’.\nIn Friedrich Nietzsche’s ‘Zarathustra’, the last thing that Zarathustra says to his disciples is, ’Now I am going to leave you, but even when I am gone, beware of me. I have to leave you because I have\nto make you completely free, totally free.’ So in the beginning the master helps you, persuades you to surrender. Once you have surrendered, his functioning completely changes. He starts helping you to stand on your own.\nI think that is missing somewhere. The surrender is there but the other part is not there. Then the possession can be almost destructive. Up to a certain extent it will be nourishing and then you will start feeling that now it is too late because you are losing your own roots. You will become a zombie.\nHe [the visitor’s guru] wants to come here; maybe he will come sometime.\nJust a few days ago he wrote that he wants to come. So sometime in October, November, somewhere, if he comes I will talk with him also. It is good but only half good. The other half is missing.\nBut you have not been in any way harmed by it. You escaped in the right moment. And of course when the connection was disconnected, you started feeling a little empty because that presence was gone. But good; there is nothing to be worried about. Finally you have to attain to your own presence. Nobody else’s presence is going to help you. It can indicate the way, just the beginning. It can be a support, a supportive climate at the most. But the journey is long and one has to go alone. It is the flight of the alone to the alone.\nThe master can give you courage, he can give you the confidence that it does happen. You can feel that it has happened in him. That very feeling is enough to keep you on the way, because the goal is very distant and hazards are a thousand and one. Each step can lead you astray, and on each step there will be frustration and hopelessness. Many times you will decide to go back and many times you will feel that you have gone into an imaginary world – illusions, dreams. Many times you will feel that it was better to remain worldly and not to have chosen this path, because where is the goal? The goal is behind many layers of clouds.\nIf you have been with a master, that will help you. When hope-lessness surrounds you, his love, his presence, experiences with him, will give you hope. It will hold you to the path. But finally you have to attain to your own being. That’s where things have gone a little wrong.\n[The visitor answers:... now I’m coming to you and I’m running the same pattern and it’s depressing me because I’m still not standing on my own.]\nThat will come. You just have to get a little further away from the experience that has happened. It will happen. Just a little time will heal the wound. And nothing has been lost. It has been good; on the whole, a good experience. But it was dangerous. If you had remained in it, it would have sucked you of your very potentiality.\n[The visitor continues: The thing that’s confusing me is this. If there was love between us, then how could it have been destructive?]\nLove can be destructive in many ways, because love is not necessarily enlightened, not necessarily. A mother loves the child and the whole world is suffering because mothers love their children. Ask\nthe psychiatrists, the psychologists. They say that every neurosis can be reduced to the mother- child relationship. Many people in the mad asylums are suffering from nothing but love. Fathers love their sons, priests love, politicians love. Everybody is loving but love is not necessarily enlightened.\nWhen love is enlightened, it is compassion. Then it is of a totally different quality. It gives you freedom. Its whole function is to give freedom, absolutely. And not only that it talks about freedom – it makes every effort to make you free and it makes every effort to destroy all the hindrances that come on the path of freedom.\nSo love can be, but it may not be very alert. Then it is destructive. Love plus awareness is equal to compassion. Love alone is not enough, otherwise the world would already have become a paradise. You love your woman, your woman loves you, but what happens finally? Nothing but destruction. Your love is okay but you are not okay. Something is there deep down in the unconscious which goes on creating things that you are not aware of. So one can be very loving – and that’s the danger of love.\nA person need not be a Buddha to love; that’s the problem. One can love, and sometimes love is more harmful than hate because you cannot defend yourself against love. If I love you, how will you defend yourself? Even the idea to defend yourself will make you feel guilty. You will become vulnerable and because I love you, I will be dominant. Love can become a very subtle politics, and it does. It becomes very dictatorial.\nSo love is not necessarily freedom. It should be – that is the ideal. So always remember, if you love somebody with awareness, only then is it going to be a blessing. Otherwise, nobody knows – you may talk, you may even desire, you may intend it to be a blessing, but that doesn’t matter. The total result is going to be wrong because somewhere you are wrong.\nOnce you understand that it is very easy to become powerful through love, once you have understood the politics of love and you have become efficient in it, there is a great technique in your hands and people will just be victims. They will not know how to escape because even the idea will make them feel guilty. The man loves you so much – where are you going?\nYou cannot find a worse mother than a good mother, can you? It is impossible. A good mother is so good that she kills you completely. Even a bad mother is better because at least with a bad mother you can fight and through fight you can become yourself. With a good mother there is no chance; with good parents there is no chance. You are doomed.\nSo love is not necessarily a blessing. Out of one hundred cases, in ninety-nine cases, love is a curse... sweet poison. And when the poison is sweet, one tends to forget that it is poison.\nAwareness is the most important thing. The presence of an aware person, even if he is not loving, is going to be a blessing. He may not bother about love at all. He may not be loving at all; he may be very very hard. A zen master will be very hard, almost cruel. He can beat you. He can throw you out of the window. He will not show any love whatsoever, but he will show awareness and his awareness is going to be a blessing.\nI don’t say that love should be denied, but love should not be the first. Awareness should be the first. Love has to follow like a shadow.\nWhenever you are eating something, nourishment should be the first thing, taste, second. If it has good flavour and good taste, very good, but one should not think that taste is enough to make anything nourishing or that good flavour is essential. That’s how synthetic food, false food, is becoming more and more prevalent in the world, because now people understand what taste is liked, what flavour is liked and what colour is liked. These are not essential things.\nYou don’t eat colour, you don’t eat flavour, you don’t eat taste. They are good if they are there, but if you eat something which has nothing to do with them and that something has vitality, the aliveness of the food, the organicness of it, that is the most essential thing.\nSo awareness is first and love is second. Good, if a master can manage to be loving and his lovingness does not become a substitute for his awareness. Otherwise it is better to drop love and just be aware because then you will not harm anybody.\nNow, in the West, people are missing love. You have to understand that. Family life is almost gone. The old days of a loving atmosphere are no more there. Everywhere is conflict and violence, struggle between the children and parents, between husband and wife, man and woman, this class and that, between white and black. Everywhere there is conflict, struggle, violence, aggression, anger. Love has disappeared – and love is a basic need of humanity.\nSo anybody who shows a little love, people become mad after him. Now there will arise many people who will show love and will dominate you. Love is now going to be the politics of the future, because people are missing love so much that anybody can put his hand on your head and you feel tremendously thrilled. That’s how gurus have become so dominant and prominent in the West. It has almost become a great traffic from the East. People who were of no value here have become great masters there, like M...juststupidpeople.Buttheyaregreatmastersbecausetheyjustshowyoulove.\nThe West is in a great turmoil and some basic ingredient is missing. Somebody has to fulfill it, and many people are fulfilling it. I have seen many people who have no value in the East becoming great masters there. They are nothing, but your need is very much.\nWhen one is hungry, one starts eating anything. When one is thirsty, one can drink dirty water. In deserts it happens sometimes that a person has to drink his own urine. No water – what to do? It is unthinkable ordinarily; but when you are dying, one doesn’t bother whether it is urine or water. Anything will do. People kill their animals, their horses or camels, and drink their blood.\nThat’s what is happening: love is missing and people are in search of love. Whomsoever can patronise you, whomsoever has known your need and can just give you an idea of a father and mother.… You have missed your mother, you have missed your father, so anybody can come and say, ‘I am your father.’ So, father-figures will arise, mother-figures will arise – and they’re all substitutes. They’re not going to help very much. They are temporary arrangements and can be destructive if one clings to them for very long.\nSo even when you see the facticity of one person, you start moving to another guru. From there you will go somewhere else, but look deeply into what you are searching for. If you are searching for love, then love has to arise in your heart. Whatsoever is your need has to come out of your being.\nAnd find a man, find a community, where love is not given to you but ways and methods are given to you so that you can grow into love yourself. Consolations are not given to you. These are very simple. I can be loving to you and can console you, but this is not going to help. The only thing that can help is something to help your growth.\nSomewhere you are stuck and you have not been yet able to find your heart. So how to help to find your heart ? That cannot be done by becoming dependent. Surrender is good to learn, very good to trust, but one should always remember that surrender is just the beginning. Freedom is the end. Be here, meditate, do a few groups, and let us see what can be done, mm?\n[An older sannyasin reports back on the advice Osho had given her (on June 28) to be like a child again.\nShe said on the third day she was teasing someone who became angry with her: I started to watch how I became conditioned again, watching how it happened. The result was that by and by I lost the childhood and now I’m back in the same boat.]\nNo, no, you are not in the same boat. You can never be in the same boat. The boat may be the same but you are not the same. A few more things have to be done. I was aware that it would be difficult. It is bound to be difficult, because it is not only a question of you; others get involved in it.\nSo now do one thing: with others, just play a game of being adult. Don’t get identified with it... as if you are just playing a role of being adult but in fact you are a child and are playing a game of being adult because adults think that you are old. So with others just go on playing the game of being adult, and continue your friendship with small children. With them become a small child, and whenever you are alone, think in terms of your being a child. Sometimes just sing small songs that children sing or just talk to the wall or play with words, say gibberish as small children do; sitting alone, be a child. In your room, in your bathroom, be a child.\nWhen somebody else comes in, just change your role. And do it consciously and deliberately so that deep down you remain a child. On the surface you play the role because others expect certain things. So, good – we are not to disturb anybody. If they expect, then their expectations can be fulfilled easily – but do it deliberately.\nWhen for the first time you started feeling like a child, you were identified with your old age and you were going into childhood. Now reverse it. You are a child, and whenever you need to be old, you have to deliberately, consciously, be old. Nobody will be offended then and nobody will be angry and your work will not be disturbed. You will find this more convenient and helpful.\nWith adults just play a role, because they are identified with their bodies and they think of you also as your body. They cannot see that something deep down has changed, is changing. They cannot see, so it is not to be forced on them; there is no need. So for this camp, for ten days, just move between these two roles. Try, and see how it works. It you have any difficulty, come back and tell me.\n[A sannyasin asked about her relationship problems. Osho said she should not do anything but allow things to settle by themselves. If she made a decision to leave her boyfriend or to stay with him, the part in her that was resistant would create trouble.]\n... so it is always good to let things settle on their own accord. Whatsoever we do creates more trouble than it solves. And there is no hurry. Why bother that it is not going anywhere? What is going anywhere? Who is going anywhere? Nobody has ever heard of any relationship going anywhere. Nothing goes anywhere. Everything is here.\nWhen you feel good, be together. When you don’t feel good it is better to be frank. And there is no need to feel guilty that you are using him, because you can tell him that if he does not feel like being with you, perfectly good. When you both agree to be together and both agree to move into some space, good. When even one is not willing, then don’t force it. Then nobody is using anybody. The relationship remains free. You come close, you go away, but nothing is being forced.\n[Osho said if one started trying to settle things, the venture was doomed from the start, because the mind is a great planner but it knows nothing of the future. Rather, Osho said, it was better to live moment by moment.]\nWhen loving, then be really loving. When non-loving, forget all about it. One day or other the world is going to accept this fact – that lovers should not live together. They should live separately, and whenever they want to be together, they can be together. Whenever they don’t want to be together, there is no need for them to be.\nMarriage and divorce should both disappear. They are both together; divorce exists because of marriage. Once marriage disappears, divorce will also disappear. People should be free to be together or not and each moment should decide its own truth. Why should we decide ahead? why decide for tomorrow? Tomorrow will come and decide. Let tomorrow have its own say and then you will always be happy and you will never be fighting against the current. You will always be relaxed, moving with the current, floating with it.\nAnd existence is not going anywhere; that you should remember. It is just being here. Nothing is going anywhere. All coming and going, all arrival and departure is just a dream world. All that is, is simply here. Nothing is going anywhere. It has never gone anywhere and it will never go anywhere.\nSo simply relax, and don’t feel guilty.

changes, the body needs a new structure.</p><p><br></p><p>And Rolfing is nothing but restructuring. It tries to melt the old
musculature and helps the body to create new musculature. For example if
a man is very angry, he has a certain musculature in the hands, in the
arms, in the shoulders, in the teeth. An angry person is bound to have a
very deep and subtle layer of tension in the jaw, in the teeth, in the
hands. When you drop anger, or you release it, cathart it, suddenly
there is no need for the old structure. So if you don’t do Rolfing, that
old structure can exist for months, even for years. That old structure
can force you into old ways, into old habits, even though the mind has
changed, because the body has its own weight.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times you do things and later on you say, ‘I did it in spite of
myself.’ How can a person do something in spite of himself? But it
happens. It happens because the body has its own way and sometimes it is
too much. The mind knows it is wrong. The mind doesn’t want to do it,
but the old habit is such that the body forces you and you are just
pulled into the old habit.</p><p><br></p><p>So when the mind is really changing through meditation, Rolfing is a
great support and it changes the structure very easily. But if the mind
is not undergoing changes, then Rolfing is very painful because the mind
is not ready and you are forcing the structure to change, and that
structure has an existential necessity. Even if you do Rolfing, the body
will accumulate the same tension again.</p><p><br></p><p>For a few days you will feel very good, but again, because the mind
is still there, it will create its own field.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor from the States said that she had done EST and had found
it quite helpful.]</p><p><br></p><p>It can be very helpful. It is one of the most powerful things going
in the West and very meaningful. Though it is not yet a complete system,
it is a beginning and a good beginning...</p><p><br></p><p>It is just technology and a sort of brainwashing, but it is good if
you can use it and you are not stuck in it; then it is very beneficial.
If you get stuck in it, it can just be a wastage because the real thing
is how to go beyond techniques and how to reach to love.</p><p><br></p><p>All techniques are good if they help you to go beyond, beyond them.
Everything is good but basically it should make you capable of living
your life from your innermost core. For example, a person is ill and you
give him medicine. But medicine is not health, and if he becomes
dependent on medicine, it is a new sort of illness. Sooner or later he
has to drop the medicine. It is just to help his own healing powers.
Once that healing power starts functioning, the medicine has to be
reduced and dropped. But the real thing is to go beyond it and to find
your own source.</p><p><br></p><p>All the techniques that are very prevalent in the West are just
techniques. Techniques are good if they lead you to the heart, to love,
to a flowering of your own innermost being. But one can get stuck in
them, and there is every possibility for the modern mind to get stuck
because the modern mind is technological. Mind as such is technological.
So do a few meditations here.…</p><p><br></p><p>[Another visitor said he had been with spiritual master who seemed to
‘possess’ him – he could feel his presence when he was alone meditating.
He was still very confused about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checked his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing was wrong in it. You simply became afraid. There is nothing
like evil, but because you became afraid you interpreted it as if
something was wrong. It always happens that if you become possessed by
somebody’s presence – even if the presence is good – you feel very
frightened because you are losing your own space. One feels good on the
one hand because one’s being is being nourished. On the other hand one
feels very much deprived because one’s freedom is lost..</p><p><br></p><p>But nothing was wrong in it. It happened naturally and it has helped
you. Even the disconnecting was good, because if it was not
disconnected, it may have killed your freedom. So it is good that you
moved at the right time. This is a very subtle problem and the West is
still not acquainted with it.</p><p><br></p><p>A master has to work on the disciple in a very skillful way. He has
to possess him but he has not to destroy his freedom. He has to nourish
him but he has not to make him dependent. On one hand he has to help him
to surrender and on the other he has to give him more will. The function
of the master is very paradoxical. And this is the paradox: on one hand
he says ‘Surrender’, and on the other hand he says ‘Beware of me’.</p><p><br></p><p>In Friedrich Nietzsche’s ‘Zarathustra’, the last thing that
Zarathustra says to his disciples is, ’Now I am going to leave you, but
even when I am gone, beware of me. I have to leave you because I
have</p><p><br></p><p>to make you completely free, totally free.’ So in the beginning the
master helps you, persuades you to surrender. Once you have surrendered,
his functioning completely changes. He starts helping you to stand on
your own.</p><p><br></p><p>I think that is missing somewhere. The surrender is there but the
other part is not there. Then the possession can be almost destructive.
Up to a certain extent it will be nourishing and then you will start
feeling that now it is too late because you are losing your own roots.
You will become a zombie.</p><p><br></p><p>He [the visitor’s guru] wants to come here; maybe he will come
sometime.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago he wrote that he wants to come. So sometime in
October, November, somewhere, if he comes I will talk with him also. It
is good but only half good. The other half is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have not been in any way harmed by it. You escaped in the
right moment. And of course when the connection was disconnected, you
started feeling a little empty because that presence was gone. But good;
there is nothing to be worried about. Finally you have to attain to your
own presence. Nobody else’s presence is going to help you. It can
indicate the way, just the beginning. It can be a support, a supportive
climate at the most. But the journey is long and one has to go alone. It
is the flight of the alone to the alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The master can give you courage, he can give you the confidence that
it does happen. You can feel that it has happened in him. That very
feeling is enough to keep you on the way, because the goal is very
distant and hazards are a thousand and one. Each step can lead you
astray, and on each step there will be frustration and hopelessness.
Many times you will decide to go back and many times you will feel that
you have gone into an imaginary world – illusions, dreams. Many times
you will feel that it was better to remain worldly and not to have
chosen this path, because where is the goal? The goal is behind many
layers of clouds.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have been with a master, that will help you. When
hope-lessness surrounds you, his love, his presence, experiences with
him, will give you hope. It will hold you to the path. But finally you
have to attain to your own being. That’s where things have gone a little
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor answers:... now I’m coming to you and I’m running the
same pattern and it’s depressing me because I’m still not standing on my
own.]</p><p><br></p><p>That will come. You just have to get a little further away from the
experience that has happened. It will happen. Just a little time will
heal the wound. And nothing has been lost. It has been good; on the
whole, a good experience. But it was dangerous. If you had remained in
it, it would have sucked you of your very potentiality.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor continues: The thing that’s confusing me is this. If
there was love between us, then how could it have been destructive?]</p><p><br></p><p>Love can be destructive in many ways, because love is not necessarily
enlightened, not necessarily. A mother loves the child and the whole
world is suffering because mothers love their children. Ask</p><p><br></p><p>the psychiatrists, the psychologists. They say that every neurosis
can be reduced to the mother- child relationship. Many people in the mad
asylums are suffering from nothing but love. Fathers love their sons,
priests love, politicians love. Everybody is loving but love is not
necessarily enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>When love is enlightened, it is compassion. Then it is of a totally
different quality. It gives you freedom. Its whole function is to give
freedom, absolutely. And not only that it talks about freedom – it makes
every effort to make you free and it makes every effort to destroy all
the hindrances that come on the path of freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>So love can be, but it may not be very alert. Then it is destructive.
Love plus awareness is equal to compassion. Love alone is not enough,
otherwise the world would already have become a paradise. You love your
woman, your woman loves you, but what happens finally? Nothing but
destruction. Your love is okay but you are not okay. Something is there
deep down in the unconscious which goes on creating things that you are
not aware of. So one can be very loving – and that’s the danger of
love.</p><p><br></p><p>A person need not be a Buddha to love; that’s the problem. One can
love, and sometimes love is more harmful than hate because you cannot
defend yourself against love. If I love you, how will you defend
yourself? Even the idea to defend yourself will make you feel guilty.
You will become vulnerable and because I love you, I will be dominant.
Love can become a very subtle politics, and it does. It becomes very
dictatorial.</p><p><br></p><p>So love is not necessarily freedom. It should be – that is the ideal.
So always remember, if you love somebody with awareness, only then is it
going to be a blessing. Otherwise, nobody knows – you may talk, you may
even desire, you may intend it to be a blessing, but that doesn’t
matter. The total result is going to be wrong because somewhere you are
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand that it is very easy to become powerful through
love, once you have understood the politics of love and you have become
efficient in it, there is a great technique in your hands and people
will just be victims. They will not know how to escape because even the
idea will make them feel guilty. The man loves you so much – where are
you going?</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find a worse mother than a good mother, can you? It is
impossible. A good mother is so good that she kills you completely. Even
a bad mother is better because at least with a bad mother you can fight
and through fight you can become yourself. With a good mother there is
no chance; with good parents there is no chance. You are doomed.</p><p><br></p><p>So love is not necessarily a blessing. Out of one hundred cases, in
ninety-nine cases, love is a curse... sweet poison. And when the poison
is sweet, one tends to forget that it is poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness is the most important thing. The presence of an aware
person, even if he is not loving, is going to be a blessing. He may not
bother about love at all. He may not be loving at all; he may be very
very hard. A zen master will be very hard, almost cruel. He can beat
you. He can throw you out of the window. He will not show any love
whatsoever, but he will show awareness and his awareness is going to be
a blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say that love should be denied, but love should not be the
first. Awareness should be the first. Love has to follow like a
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are eating something, nourishment should be the first
thing, taste, second. If it has good flavour and good taste, very good,
but one should not think that taste is enough to make anything
nourishing or that good flavour is essential. That’s how synthetic food,
false food, is becoming more and more prevalent in the world, because
now people understand what taste is liked, what flavour is liked and
what colour is liked. These are not essential things.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t eat colour, you don’t eat flavour, you don’t eat taste.
They are good if they are there, but if you eat something which has
nothing to do with them and that something has vitality, the aliveness
of the food, the organicness of it, that is the most essential
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>So awareness is first and love is second. Good, if a master can
manage to be loving and his lovingness does not become a substitute for
his awareness. Otherwise it is better to drop love and just be aware
because then you will not harm anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, in the West, people are missing love. You have to understand
that. Family life is almost gone. The old days of a loving atmosphere
are no more there. Everywhere is conflict and violence, struggle between
the children and parents, between husband and wife, man and woman, this
class and that, between white and black. Everywhere there is conflict,
struggle, violence, aggression, anger. Love has disappeared – and love
is a basic need of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>So anybody who shows a little love, people become mad after him. Now
there will arise many people who will show love and will dominate you.
Love is now going to be the politics of the future, because people are
missing love so much that anybody can put his hand on your head and you
feel tremendously thrilled. That’s how gurus have become so dominant and
prominent in the West. It has almost become a great traffic from the
East. People who were of no value here have become <span class=s5>great masters there, like M</span><span class=s6>.</span><span class=s7>..juststupidpeople.Buttheyaregreatmastersbecausetheyjustshowyoulove.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The West is in a great turmoil and some basic ingredient is missing.
Somebody has to fulfill it, and many people are fulfilling it. I have
seen many people who have no value in the East becoming great masters
there. They are nothing, but your need is very much.</p><p><br></p><p>When one is hungry, one starts eating anything. When one is thirsty,
one can drink dirty water. In deserts it happens sometimes that a person
has to drink his own urine. No water – what to do? It is unthinkable
ordinarily; but when you are dying, one doesn’t bother whether it is
urine or water. Anything will do. People kill their animals, their
horses or camels, and drink their blood.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what is happening: love is missing and people are in search of
love. Whomsoever can patronise you, whomsoever has known your need and
can just give you an idea of a father and mother.… You have missed your
mother, you have missed your father, so anybody can come and say, ‘I am
your father.’ So, father-figures will arise, mother-figures will arise –
and they’re all substitutes. They’re not going to help very much. They
are temporary arrangements and can be destructive if one clings to them
for very long.</p><p><br></p><p>So even when you see the facticity of one person, you start moving to
another guru. From there you will go somewhere else, but look deeply
into what you are searching for. If you are searching for love, then
love has to arise in your heart. Whatsoever is your need has to come out
of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>And find a man, find a community, where love is not given to you but
ways and methods are given to you so that you can grow into love
yourself. Consolations are not given to you. These are very simple. I
can be loving to you and can console you, but this is not going to help.
The only thing that can help is something to help your growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhere you are stuck and you have not been yet able to find your
heart. So how to help to find your heart ? That cannot be done by
becoming dependent. Surrender is good to learn, very good to trust, but
one should always remember that surrender is just the beginning. Freedom
is the end. Be here, meditate, do a few groups, and let us see what can
be done, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[An older sannyasin reports back on the advice Osho had given her (on
June 28) to be like a child again.</p><p><br></p><p>She said on the third day she was teasing someone who became angry
with her: I started to watch how I became conditioned again, watching
how it happened. The result was that by and by I lost the childhood and
now I’m back in the same boat.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, no, you are not in the same boat. You can never be in the same
boat. The boat may be the same but you are not the same. A few more
things have to be done. I was aware that it would be difficult. It is
bound to be difficult, because it is not only a question of you; others
get involved in it.</p><p><br></p><p>So now do one thing: with others, just play a game of being adult.
Don’t get identified with it... as if you are just playing a role of
being adult but in fact you are a child and are playing a game of being
adult because adults think that you are old. So with others just go on
playing the game of being adult, and continue your friendship with small
children. With them become a small child, and whenever you are alone,
think in terms of your being a child. Sometimes just sing small songs
that children sing or just talk to the wall or play with words, say
gibberish as small children do; sitting alone, be a child. In your room,
in your bathroom, be a child.</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody else comes in, just change your role. And do it
consciously and deliberately so that deep down you remain a child. On
the surface you play the role because others expect certain things. So,
good – we are not to disturb anybody. If they expect, then their
expectations can be fulfilled easily – but do it deliberately.</p><p><br></p><p>When for the first time you started feeling like a child, you were
identified with your old age and you were going into childhood. Now
reverse it. You are a child, and whenever you need to be old, you have
to deliberately, consciously, be old. Nobody will be offended then and
nobody will be angry and your work will not be disturbed. You will find
this more convenient and helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>With adults just play a role, because they are identified with their
bodies and they think of you also as your body. They cannot see that
something deep down has changed, is changing. They cannot see, so it is
not to be forced on them; there is no need. So for this camp, for ten
days, just move between these two roles. Try, and see how it works. It
you have any difficulty, come back and tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asked about her relationship problems. Osho said she
should not do anything but allow things to settle by themselves. If she
made a decision to leave her boyfriend or to stay with him, the part in
her that was resistant would create trouble.]</p><p><br></p><p>... so it is always good to let things settle on their own accord.
Whatsoever we do creates more trouble than it solves. And there is no
hurry. Why bother that it is not going anywhere? What is going anywhere?
Who is going anywhere? Nobody has ever heard of any relationship going
anywhere. Nothing goes anywhere. Everything is here.</p><p><br></p><p>When you feel good, be together. When you don’t feel good it is
better to be frank. And there is no need to feel guilty that you are
using him, because you can tell him that if he does not feel like being
with you, perfectly good. When you both agree to be together and both
agree to move into some space, good. When even one is not willing, then
don’t force it. Then nobody is using anybody. The relationship remains
free. You come close, you go away, but nothing is being forced.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho said if one started trying to settle things, the venture was
doomed from the start, because the mind is a great planner but it knows
nothing of the future. Rather, Osho said, it was better to live moment
by moment.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>When loving, then be really loving. When non-loving, forget all about
it. One day or other the world is going to accept this fact – that
lovers should not live together. They should live separately, and
whenever they want to be together, they can be together. Whenever they
don’t want to be together, there is no need for them to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage and divorce should both disappear. They are both together;
divorce exists because of marriage. Once marriage disappears, divorce
will also disappear. People should be free to be together or not and
each moment should decide its own truth. Why should we decide ahead? why
decide for tomorrow? Tomorrow will come and decide. Let tomorrow have
its own say and then you will always be happy and you will never be
fighting against the current. You will always be relaxed, moving with
the current, floating with it.</p><p><br></p><p>And existence is not going anywhere; that you should remember. It is
just being here. Nothing is going anywhere. All coming and going, all
arrival and departure is just a dream world. All that is, is simply
here. Nothing is going anywhere. It has never gone anywhere and it will
never go anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply relax, and don’t feel guilty. Enjoy...</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

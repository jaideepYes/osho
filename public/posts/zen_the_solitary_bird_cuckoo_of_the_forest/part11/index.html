It is a miracle that in such small dialogues, the greatest of experiences, which are inexpressible, are expressed. Look at this small anecdote:\nKINZAN, GANTO AND SEPPO – all masters – WERE DOING ZAZEN WHEN TOZAN CAME IN WITH THE TEA.\nZazen, as you know, means simply sitting and doing nothing. Not even thinking, because thinking is also doing. Simply not doing anything – physical, mental, or spiritual – just being like a flame, unwavering, without any wind around.\nTOZAN CAME IN WITH THE TEA. KINZAN SHUT HIS EYES. TOZAN ASKED, “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?”\nDo you see the point? By closing your eyes, certainly you are going inwards, but exactly where? Because just the word ‘inward’ is not indicative of any destination. The inwardness is as vast as outwardness. “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?”\nKINZAN REPLIED,\n“I AM ENTERING DHYANA” – meditation. In an ordinary way, his answer is perfect. But Zen is not ordinary – never for a single moment. It is always and always extraordinary. Because Tozan immediately said:\n“DHYANA – meditation – HAS NO GATE; HOW CAN YOU ENTER INTO IT?”\nNow ... great masters, just at tea time, talking of great things ... Tea time becomes absolutely sacred. Tozan’s point is that dhyana has no gate; it is all openness, it is the whole sky inside – how are you going to enter? From what gate? It has no gate.\nOut of the remaining three, nobody said anything. It is true; there is no gate inside. And this is also true, that just by sitting silently, doing nothing, without any gate, you enter in. The gate is not a necessity. Can’t you enter this Buddha Hall without a gate? Inside there is no wall, no question of a gate; hence the remaining three masters did not say a single word. Tozan has uttered an ultimate question; only silence can be the answer.\nA MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS THE WAY WITHOUT MISTAKES?”\nJOSHU SAID, “KNOWING ONE’S MIND, SEEING INTO ONE’S NATURE, IS THE WAY WITHOUT MISTAKES.”\nMind can commit mistakes but once you are beyond mind, there is no one to commit mistakes. Mind can go wrong, but beyond mind there is no way of going wrong. Beyond mind, you are simply drowned into your own nature.\nA MONK ASKED GANTO, “WHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT SHALL WE DO?”\nBy the Three Worlds is meant heaven, earth, and hell. And they are all attacking us, throwing us this way or that way, pulling this way or that way.\nWHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT SHALL WE DO? GANTO SAID, “SIT STILL!”\nTHE MONK WAS SURPRISED AND SAID, “PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE.”\nA little more is not possible. SIT STILL is more than enough already. Sit still and there is no hell, no heaven, no earth. Just one single universe, all boundaries dissolved, all divisions disappeared. Now what more can be said? But the poor monk could not understand. He asked, PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE. Ganto said, BRING ME MOUNT RO ...\nRO is Japanese for Mount Sumeru – I have explained it to you, the gold mountain in heaven, a thousand times bigger than the Himalayas. Nobody knows its end and nobody knows its beginning.\nGanto said, “Bring me Sumeru and I will tell you.” He is saying to the monk, “Don’t ask stupid questions; otherwise I have to answer stupidly. Don’t be idiotic; otherwise out of compassion I have to be idiotic with you, just so you have companionship.”\nNobody can bring Mount Sumeru. It is just a mythology, it exists nowhere. And even if it exists, how can you bring it?\nAsking a question that assumes something more can be said about meditation than “Sit still” is asking something absolutely impossible.\nSit still and all three worlds disappear. In this moment, listening to the cuckoo, all has disappeared. There is only a deep silence, in, deepening within your being.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, ZUIGAN ASKED GANTO, “WHAT IS THE ETERNAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?”\nGANTO REPLIED, “MOVEMENT” – change. ZUIGAN ASKED, “WHAT IS THIS MOVEMENT?”\nGANTO SAID, “WHEN YOU SEE THINGS MOVE, CAN’T YOU SEE THIS ETERNAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?”\nA rosebush growing, bringing roses ... a cuckoo suddenly starts singing, and each moment everything is growing that is living. The bamboos are becoming bigger, and even the Himalayas are becoming bigger. Howsoever slow the change ... the Himalaya becomes one foot higher every year. But in this eternity that is too much. Finally, you can imagine, if it does not stop growing it will become absolutely impossible for another Edmund Hillary to reach Mount Everest.\nBut existence is growing. Trees are growing, you are growing, your consciousness is growing. Nothing is static. Movement is the fundamental question, and Ganto has put it correctly: When you see things move, can’t you see this eternal principle of things? Life is growth, in short. The moment you stop growing, you are dead.\nLife has to be a river, always moving. The moment you become frozen somewhere, the movement is stopped, life disappears.\nEven your going in is growing every day, deeper and deeper and deeper. You have to find the eternal source of your being. It is a great dive inside. And every day, every moment, you can go on growing in it. There is no end to it. You don’t simply become a buddha and stop. If you stop, then you become just a stone statue.\nI sometimes wonder ... all these stone statues of Buddha around the world – are these real people who have stopped growing and become stones? Will they ever understand and start growing again, and talking and walking?\nEven Gautam Buddha has accepted that there is something still beyond him. He is not the end, he is only the beginning. A true understanding, an honest expression – Buddha says, “I am only born, now the growth begins.”\nZUIGAN WAS LOST IN THOUGHT – listening to Ganto – AND GANTO SAID, “IF YOU AGREE TO THIS, YOU ARE STILL IN THE DUST OF THIS WORLD.”\nThis is a very beautiful point to be remembered. If you agree to this, to what I have said, remember: agreement means movement has stopped. You have already agreed. If you agree to this, you are still in the world.\nAND IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SUNK IN LIFE AND DEATH.\nWhat a great insight, that even agreement or disagreement are not allowed. You are to grow beyond all dualities, it does not matter what the duality is. Because every duality means choosing one against the other, and growth stops.\nLife is a choicelessness. Never choose. Just be, and allow your being to grow to unknown skies, to unknown spaces. And you will find your buddhahood bringing more and more flowers, showering more and more blessings, bringing greater and greater ecstasies. And there is no end to it.\nManzan wrote a poem:\nONE MINUTE OF SITTING, ONE INCH OF BUDDHA. LIKE LIGHTNING, ALL THOUGHTS COME AND PASS. JUST ONCE LOOK INTO YOUR MIND DEPTHS:\nNOTHING ELSE HAS EVER BEEN.\nTwo points he is making in his small poem. ONE MINUTE OF SITTING – even one minute of sitting without doing anything, no thought is stirred inside you, all is utterly silent – ONE INCH OF BUDDHA. You have found at least one inch of buddhahood. And you don’t need much more. Each moment, go on. And whatever you have found will also go on growing. From one inch to one yard, and from one yard to one mile, and from one mile to one light year, and it will go on and on. Buddhahood is a pilgrimage which ends nowhere.\nAnd what is the meaning of sitting?\nLike lightning, all thoughts come and pass; you just remain watchful. Don’t make any judgment or identification.\nJust like lightning, let them come and go. You remain in your depths, just silent and witnessing, and you will be surprised: nothing else has ever been, except your inner depth. Your innermost silence is the stuff existence is made of.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha is asking:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE STORY OF ZUIGAN SEEMS TO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD, DOESN’T IT?\nIS IT NOT SO, THAT WE ARE LITERALLY “LOST IN THOUGHT” AND FOUND AGAIN IN MEDITATION?\nManeesha, ordinarily what you are saying is absolutely right. In thought, you are lost, in meditation you are found. But if you want to listen to the answer in Zen language, there is no losing and no finding.\nThere is simply silence. You are not.\nThese songs of cuckoos pass through you just as through a hollow bamboo.\nIn thoughts, you start imagining that you are. When thoughts are not there, don’t start imagining that now you are really. Once thoughts are gone, you are also simply a thought; you are also gone. Then what remains is only a pure consciousness, without any “I” attached to it.\nYou don’t find yourself, you simply lose yourself, both the ways: either you lose yourself in thoughts or you lose yourself in no-thought. But losing yourself in thought is very ordinary; losing yourself in no-thought has a splendor and an eternity of joy and bliss. You are not there, but there is a dance of pure consciousness. It is not your dance – you are gone with your thoughts. You were nothing but the combination of your thoughts. As one by one your thoughts disappear, part by part you melt away. Finally, you are no more.\nAnd this is the moment – when you are no more – that the ultimate is in your hands. It is a strange situation:\nWhen you are, your hands are empty. When you are not, your hands are full.\nWhen you are, you are simply misery, anguish. When you are not, there is bliss. You cannot say, “I am blissful”; there is only bliss.\nThere is only silence. There is only truth.\nThe cuckoos have become silent, waiting for a few laughs from you. Remember, laughter is one of the ways in which you can disappear. Only laughter remainsThe cuckoo has started again,\ncalling forth.\nDoctor Lech, the school physician, is examining the young, shapely co-ed. He picks up his stethoscope and placing it very carefully near the sweet young thing’s heart, he says, “Big breaths.”\nThe young girl smiles coyly and replies, “Yeth, and I am not even thickthteen yet!”\nA Protestant minister goes to a barber for a haircut. When the barber has finished, the minister says, “How much do I owe you, my good man?”\nThe barber replies, “That’s okay, Reverend. No charge for a man of the cloth.”\nThe minister is very pleased and the next day a bunch of flowers from the minister arrives for the barber’s wife.\nNext week a Catholic priest goes in for a haircut. When it is done he says, “How much do I owe you, my good man?”\n“Nothing, Father,” replies the barber. “No charge for a man of the cloth.” The next day a big box of chocolates for the barber’s wife is delivered to the shop.\nTwo days later a Jewish rabbi has a haircut and when it is done he is told the same thing. “That’s very kind of you,” says the rabbi, and he leaves the shop.\nHalf an hour later, eight rabbis come in for a haircut.\nMolly O’Brien goes to visit the parish priest, Father Hogan, for confession. “Father,” she says, “I feel so bad. Last night I called a man a dirty bastard.”\n“Now, why,” says Father Hogan, “would you want to say a thing like that, my child?” “Well, Father, you see,” says Molly, “he put his arm around me.”\n“What, like this?” says Hogan. “Yes,” says Molly, “just like that.”\n“Well,” says Hogan, “that is no reason to call him a dirty bastard.” “Yes, but then, Father, he kissed me!”\n“What, like this?” asks the priest. “Yes,” says Molly.\n“Well,” replies Hogan, “that is no reason to call him a dirty bastard.”\n“I know, Father. But then you see, he put me down on the sofa and lifted my dress.” “You mean, like this?”\n“Yes, Father.”\n“Well,” says Hogan, “still no reason to call him a bastard.” “Yes, but then he pulled his pants down!” cries Molly. “Like this?” asks the priest.\n“Yes,” says Molly.\n“Well, that is still no reason to call him a dirty bastard.” “But Father ... then he made love to me!”\n“Like this?” gasps Hogan. “Yes, Father,” moans Molly.\n“And you called him a dirty bastard for that?”\n“But, Father, you see, then he told me that he had gonorrhea!” “Jesus Christ!” cries Hogan, “the dirty bastard!”\nHamish MacTavish picks up a girl in a bar. After a few drinks, they go to a hotel room and make love. In the middle of the night, Hamish wakes up to go to the bathroom. When he gets out of bed, he notices that the woman has taken off a wooden leg, and has leaned it against the wall.\nHamish is fascinated by it, and as the girl is asleep, he starts fiddling with its springs and braces. But finally he finds that he has taken the wooden leg apart and can’t put it back together again.\nHe goes out into the hall and stops the first person that comes along, who happens to be Paddy, very drunk. “Can you help me?” says Hamish. “I have got a woman in my room with one leg apart, and I can’t seem to get it back together.”\n“Hell!” replies Paddy. “That’s nothing. I have got a woman in my room with both legs apart, and I can’t even find the goddam door!”\nNow, Nivedano, give the first beat to the drum and everybody goes crazy. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes.\nNo movement ... just be a stone statue and let your consciousness deepen inwards, just like an arrow going in ... in ... in.\nThis is one inch of Buddha.\nIf you can keep it all the day long underneath your activities, it does not matter what you do, you remain a buddha.\nAnd to be a buddha is the only richness there is, and the only life there is.\nOnly in this silence flowers have blossomed, songs have arisen, poetry without words, and dance without movements.\nThis is the ultimate mystery of you and of the whole existence. To make it deeper ...\nNivedano ...\n(Drumbeat)\nAnd everybody dies.\nRelax so deeply, as if you are dead, so that only an inner consciousness becomes a concentrated, crystallized center.\nThis is it.\nNeither you nor me, but simply the isness of existence, the unbounded sky of your inner world. You can open your wings and fly in the inner world without any bondage, without any weight. This has been called by the buddhas and the siddhas, the only freedom.\nGreat is this blissfulness, this suchness, this life in death, this silence in relaxation, this peace beyond mind, this dance which is the only sacred experience in the world.\nPoor are those who have never entered in. Nivedano ...\n(Drumbeat) Come back.\nNot as you have gone in, come back alive, fresh, come back as buddhas. At least sit for a few moments.\nA few inches of buddha within you, and they will start growing. They are like seeds. You are the soil.\nYou can become a garden. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate all the buddhas? Yes!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2831","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_solitary_bird_cuckoo_of_the_forest/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_solitary_bird_cuckoo_of_the_forest/>Zen.

“WHERE ARE YOU GOING?”</p><p><br></p><p>KINZAN REPLIED,</p><p><br></p><p>“I AM ENTERING DHYANA” – meditation. In an ordinary way, his answer
is perfect. But Zen is not ordinary – never for a single moment. It is
always and always extraordinary. Because Tozan immediately said:</p><p><br></p><p>“DHYANA – meditation – HAS NO GATE; HOW CAN YOU ENTER INTO IT?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now ... great masters, just at tea time, talking of great things ...
Tea time becomes absolutely sacred. Tozan’s point is that dhyana has no
gate; it is all openness, it is the whole sky inside – how are you going
to enter? From what gate? It has no gate.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of the remaining three, nobody said anything. It is true; there
is no gate inside. And this is also true, that just by sitting silently,
doing nothing, without any gate, you enter in. The gate is not a
necessity. Can’t you enter this Buddha Hall without a gate? Inside there
is no wall, no question of a gate; hence the remaining three masters did
not say a single word. Tozan has uttered an ultimate question; only
silence can be the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS THE WAY WITHOUT MISTAKES?”</p><p>JOSHU SAID, “KNOWING ONE’S MIND, SEEING INTO ONE’S NATURE, IS THE WAY
WITHOUT MISTAKES.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mind can commit mistakes but once you are beyond mind, there is no
one to commit mistakes. Mind can go wrong, but beyond mind there is no
way of going wrong. Beyond mind, you are simply drowned into your own
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED GANTO, “WHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT
SHALL WE DO?”</p><p><br></p><p>By the Three Worlds is meant heaven, earth, and hell. And they are
all attacking us, throwing us this way or that way, pulling this way or
that way.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE THREE WORLDS ARE ATTACKING US, WHAT SHALL WE DO? GANTO SAID,
“SIT STILL!”</p><p>THE MONK WAS SURPRISED AND SAID, “PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE.”</p><p><br></p><p>A little more is not possible. SIT STILL is more than enough already.
Sit still and there is no hell, no heaven, no earth. Just one single
universe, all boundaries dissolved, all divisions disappeared. Now what
more can be said? But the poor monk could not understand. He asked,
PLEASE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE. Ganto said, BRING ME MOUNT RO ...</p><p><br></p><p>RO is Japanese for Mount Sumeru – I have explained it to you, the
gold mountain in heaven, a thousand times bigger than the Himalayas.
Nobody knows its end and nobody knows its beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Ganto said, “Bring me Sumeru and I will tell you.” He is saying to
the monk, “Don’t ask stupid questions; otherwise I have to answer
stupidly. Don’t be idiotic; otherwise out of compassion I have to be
idiotic with you, just so you have companionship.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can bring Mount Sumeru. It is just a mythology, it exists
nowhere. And even if it exists, how can you bring it?</p><p><br></p><p>Asking a question that assumes something more can be said about
meditation than “Sit still” is asking something absolutely
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit still and all three worlds disappear. In this moment, listening
to the cuckoo, all has disappeared. There is only a deep silence, in,
deepening within your being.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, ZUIGAN ASKED GANTO, “WHAT IS THE ETERNAL AND
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?”</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO REPLIED, “MOVEMENT” – change. ZUIGAN ASKED, “WHAT IS THIS
MOVEMENT?”</p><p>GANTO SAID, “WHEN YOU SEE THINGS MOVE, CAN’T YOU SEE THIS ETERNAL AND
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THINGS?”</p><p><br></p><p>A rosebush growing, bringing roses ... a cuckoo suddenly starts
singing, and each moment everything is growing that is living. The
bamboos are becoming bigger, and even the Himalayas are becoming bigger.
Howsoever slow the change ... the Himalaya becomes one foot higher every
year. But in this eternity that is too much. Finally, you can imagine,
if it does not stop growing it will become absolutely impossible for
another Edmund Hillary to reach Mount Everest.</p><p><br></p><p>But existence is growing. Trees are growing, you are growing, your
consciousness is growing. Nothing is static. Movement is the fundamental
question, and Ganto has put it correctly: When you see things move,
can’t you see this eternal principle of things? Life is growth, in
short. The moment you stop growing, you are dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has to be a river, always moving. The moment you become frozen
somewhere, the movement is stopped, life disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Even your going in is growing every day, deeper and deeper and
deeper. You have to find the eternal source of your being. It is a great
dive inside. And every day, every moment, you can go on growing in it.
There is no end to it. You don’t simply become a buddha and stop. If you
stop, then you become just a stone statue.</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes wonder ... all these stone statues of Buddha around the
world – are these real people who have stopped growing and become
stones? Will they ever understand and start growing again, and talking
and walking?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Gautam Buddha has accepted that there is something still beyond
him. He is not the end, he is only the beginning. A true understanding,
an honest expression – Buddha says, “I am only born, now the growth
begins.”</p><p><br></p><p>ZUIGAN WAS LOST IN THOUGHT – listening to Ganto – AND GANTO SAID, “IF
YOU AGREE TO THIS, YOU ARE STILL IN THE DUST OF THIS WORLD.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very beautiful point to be remembered. If you agree to
this, to what I have said, remember: agreement means movement has
stopped. You have already agreed. If you agree to this, you are still in
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>AND IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SUNK IN LIFE AND DEATH.</p><p><br></p><p>What a great insight, that even agreement or disagreement are not
allowed. You are to grow beyond all dualities, it does not matter what
the duality is. Because every duality means choosing one against the
other, and growth stops.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a choicelessness. Never choose. Just be, and allow your being
to grow to unknown skies, to unknown spaces. And you will find your
buddhahood bringing more and more flowers, showering more and more
blessings, bringing greater and greater ecstasies. And there is no end
to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Manzan wrote a poem:</p><p>ONE MINUTE OF SITTING, ONE INCH OF BUDDHA. LIKE LIGHTNING, ALL
THOUGHTS COME AND PASS. JUST ONCE LOOK INTO YOUR MIND DEPTHS:</p><p>NOTHING ELSE HAS EVER BEEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Two points he is making in his small poem. ONE MINUTE OF SITTING –
even one minute of sitting without doing anything, no thought is stirred
inside you, all is utterly silent – ONE INCH OF BUDDHA. You have found
at least one inch of buddhahood. And you don’t need much more. Each
moment, go on. And whatever you have found will also go on growing. From
one inch to one yard, and from one yard to one mile, and from one mile
to one light year, and it will go on and on. Buddhahood is a pilgrimage
which ends nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the meaning of sitting?</p><p><br></p><p>Like lightning, all thoughts come and pass; you just remain watchful.
Don’t make any judgment or identification.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like lightning, let them come and go. You remain in your depths,
just silent and witnessing, and you will be surprised: nothing else has
ever been, except your inner depth. Your innermost silence is the stuff
existence is made of.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha is asking:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE STORY OF ZUIGAN SEEMS TO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD, DOESN’T
IT?</p><p><br></p><p>IS IT NOT SO, THAT WE ARE LITERALLY “LOST IN THOUGHT” AND FOUND AGAIN
IN MEDITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, ordinarily what you are saying is absolutely right. In
thought, you are lost, in meditation you are found. But if you want to
listen to the answer in Zen language, there is no losing and no
finding.</p><p><br></p><p>There is simply silence. You are not.</p><p>These songs of cuckoos pass through you just as through a hollow
bamboo.</p><p><br></p><p>In thoughts, you start imagining that you are. When thoughts are not
there, don’t start imagining that now you are really. Once thoughts are
gone, you are also simply a thought; you are also gone. Then what
remains is only a pure consciousness, without any “I” attached to
it.</p><p>You don’t find yourself, you simply lose yourself, both the ways:
either you lose yourself in thoughts or you lose yourself in no-thought.
But losing yourself in thought is very ordinary; losing yourself in
no-thought has a splendor and an eternity of joy and bliss. You are not
there, but there is a dance of pure consciousness. It is not your dance
– you are gone with your thoughts. You were nothing but the combination
of your thoughts. As one by one your thoughts disappear, part by part
you melt away. Finally, you are no more.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the moment – when you are no more – that the ultimate is
in your hands. It is a strange situation:</p><p>When you are, your hands are empty. When you are not, your hands are
full.</p><p>When you are, you are simply misery, anguish. When you are not, there
is bliss. You cannot say, “I am blissful”; there is only bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only silence. There is only truth.</p><p>The cuckoos have become silent, waiting for a few laughs from you.
Remember, laughter is one of the ways in which you can disappear. Only
laughter remains<span class=s4></span>The cuckoo has started

but then he pulled his pants down!” cries Molly. “Like this?” asks the
priest.</p><p>“Yes,” says Molly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that is still no reason to call him a dirty bastard.” “But
Father ... then he made love to me!”</p><p>“Like this?” gasps Hogan. “Yes, Father,” moans Molly.</p><p>“And you called him a dirty bastard for that?”</p><p>“But, Father, you see, then he told me that he had gonorrhea!” “Jesus

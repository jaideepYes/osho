IF IT DOESN’T I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!”\nHE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, “HAVE YOU COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?”\nIN RESPONSE, KANKEI SAID, “FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM,” SO MASSAN SAT UPON HER SEAT, AND KANKEI APPROACHED HER.\nSHE SAID, “WHERE DID YOU COME FROM TODAY, MAY I ASK?” KANKEI REPLIED, “FROM ROKO.”\nMASSAN THEN SAID TO KANKEI, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?” KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND, MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?” SHE ANSWERED, “IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PEAK.”\nHE ASKED, “WHO IS MASSAN’S HUSBAND?”\nSHE ANSWERED, “THERE IS NOT REAL FORM OF MEN AND WOMEN.”\nHE SAID, “KWATZ!” AND ASKED, “WHY THEN DON’T YOU CHANGE AND DISAPPEAR?” SHE SAID, “I AM NOT A GOD, I AM NOT A DEMON. WHAT COULD I CHANGE?”\nAT THIS, KANKEI KNELT DOWN, AND BECAME THE GARDENER OF MASSAN’S TEMPLE FOR THREE YEARS.\nAT ANOTHER TIME, GOEI WENT TO SEKITO AND SAID, “IF YOU CAN SAY A WORD, I WILL REMAIN HERE; OTHERWISE I WILL GO AWAY.”\nSEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, AND GOEI WENT OFF. FROM THE BACK, SEKITO CALLED HIM, “JARI! JARI!” GOEI TURNED HIS HEAD.\nSEKITO SAID, “FROM BIRTH TO DEATH, IT IS JUST LIKE THIS – TURNING THE HEAD, TURNING THE BRAIN. HOW ABOUT IT?”\nGOEI WAS SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED, SO HE BROKE HIS STAFF.\nManeesha, entering into the world of Zen is not like any other entering; it is entering in yourself. There is no door, and there is no possibility of doing anything. You have simply to relax so totally that you sink deep within yourself.\nRemember, relaxation is not an activity. It is absence of all activity. And only in the absence of all activity, when you are relaxed to your very being, the door opens to all the mysteries of the world, all the miracles of existence.\nIt fills your being with great dance, although you cannot utter a single word. You hear the music that you have never heard, although there is no way to translate it to anyone else. You see flowers blossoming ... their colors are absolutely unknown to you. Your whole being becomes a fragrant luminosity. There is nothing to say about it; you can just be it. And the rays of your silence will start creating and weaving a field around you.\nThat’s why a master in Zen is not simply a teacher. In all the religions there are only teachers. They teach you about subjects which you don’t know, and they ask you to believe, because there is no way to bring those experiences into objective reality. Neither has the teacher known them – he has believed them; he transfers his belief to somebody else. Zen is not a believer’s world. It is not for the faithful ones; it is for those daring souls who can drop all belief, unbelief, doubt, reason, mind, and simply enter into their pure existence without boundaries.\nBut it brings a tremendous transformation. Hence, let me say that while others are involved in philosophies, Zen is involved in a metamorphosis, in a transformation. It is authentic alchemy: it changes you from base metal into gold. But its language has to be understood, not with your\nreasoning and intellectual mind but with your loving heart. Or even just listening, not bothering whether it is true or not. And a moment comes suddenly that you see it, which has been eluding you your whole life. Suddenly, what Gautam Buddha called “eighty-four thousand doors” open.\nThese anecdotes, when first translated by Christian missionaries, were translated to show the world that “Christianity is the only civilized religion, and as a proof look at these stupid dialogues, with no reason and no rhyme!” But everything backfired. They wanted to prove Zen to be a very primitive religion. But to those who were real seekers, it proved that on the contrary, every other religion may be primitive; at least Zen is not.\nIn the first place, it is not a religion at all. It is not in competition with Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism or Mohammedanism; it does not belong to that category at all. It has its own category, its own language, its own world, and there is no competitor to it. Its uniqueness is absolute and categorical.\nBut you will have to be very loving, very careful in understanding these strange dialogues, because the language seems to be the same as we use but hidden between the words and between the lines there is a different poetry, a different song, which we are not accustomed to.\nBut my people will understand it, because we are entering into the same space which Zen has been pointing towards. These dialogues can be understood only by meditators; otherwise they look stupid.\nTHE MONK, KANKEI, ONCE VISITED THE NUN, MASSAN RYONEN. HE SAID TO HIMSELF, “IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT, I WILL REMAIN THERE. IF IT DOES NOT, I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!”\nHe was a seeker in search of a master, and when he came to see Massan Ryonen, a woman Zen master, he thought in his own mind, IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT ... it is not a question of reasonability. Not that what she is saying is very wise, but if it hits the spot, my own being – if the arrow of what she says reaches to my being, I will stay; otherwise I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT.\nWhen a disciple comes, a seat is offered by the master for him to sit. And if the disciple rejects the master, he overturns the seat gracefully – showing that “this is not my place” – and leaves. That overturning of the Zen seat is symbolic that “I don’t accept you as a master, but I will not say it. Saying is so crude. I will just give you the hint, that you could not hit the spot of my being, for which I am searching; I will have to go to another master.”\nHE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, “HAVE YOU COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?”\nIN RESPONSE, KANKEI SAID, “FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM,” SO MASSAN SAT UPON HER SEAT, AND KANKEI APPROACHED HER.\nSHE SAID, “WHERE DID YOU COME FROM TODAY, MAY I ASK?” KANKEI REPLIED, “FROM ROKO.”\nMASSAN THEN SAID TO KANKEI, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?” KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND, MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?”\nThe bamboo hat has to be removed in grace and gratitude when you encounter a master. The removing of the hat is simply signifying that “I am available, in humbleness, open; I’m not covered or defensive. Even if you want to cut my head, I am ready.”\nIn the first court in America where my case was presented after I was illegally arrested, the woman magistrate was in a puzzle – because in America, you cannot wear your hat in the court. Wearing your hat in the court is insulting the court. Such are the different attitudes of East and West.\nI could see that she was a little bit puzzled what to do. She sent an attendant to tell me, “Perhaps you don’t know that in the court you have to remove your hat. To keep your hat on is to insult the court.”\nI said to him, “Go back to the magistrate and tell her that if she has courage, she should ask the question herself. Because according to me, to remove the hat is insulting and I will not insult the court.”\nThe man thought for a moment, went back to the magistrate. The woman was even more puzzled! She simply thought it was better not to get into an argument. Because it is not written in the constitution; it is just a formal tradition. I am not legally bound to remove my hat. I will remove my hat only when I see a buddha – not for a magistrate. Seeing the situation, the woman behaved sanely. She said to the attendant, “There is no need, just don’t raise the question again.” Different worlds, different symbols .…\nWhen Massan asked, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?” she was saying that if you have come for the sake of Buddhism – and that means for the search of the buddha within you – then be graceful. Remove the hat, be humble and be receptive.\nKANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?” Massan was\nthe woman master’s name.\nSHE ANSWERED, “IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PEAK.”\nThe woman got the name Massan because of the Massan Mountain where she had her monastery. The peaks are so high that they are almost always covered with snow and clouds; they rarely show. And that is exactly the situation of consciousness. It is so much covered with thoughts – the past, the conditionings ... so much smoke – that it rarely shows.\nThis is the beauty of Zen, that ordinary questions are suddenly turned to immense significance. HE ASKED, “WHO IS MASSAN’S HUSBAND?”\nSHE ANSWERED, “THERE IS NOT REAL FORM OF MEN AND WOMEN.”\nThe difference and discrimination between men and women is only phenomenal, it is not authentic. It does not have a spirituality to it.\nAnd now we know that science can convert men into women, women into men, and there are thousands of people around the world who have changed their sex – just bored! One gets bored: a woman every day, a woman again, and again. A man ... in the morning again you wake up a man. And one starts thinking, is there some way to change?\nPeople change clothes, people change shoes, people change ties. Up to now it was not possible, but now it is possible – many, many more people are going to change their sex. For the first time, a man will be standing behind a woman’s body, or a woman may be standing behind a man’s body. And then they will understand what mystics have always been saying, that the inside is the same; only the window and its frame is different.\nYour inner being is neither male nor female.\nListening to this, the monk said, or rather shouted, the Zen shout “KWATZ!” AND ASKED, “WHY THEN DON’T YOU CHANGE AND DISAPPEAR?”\nIf men and women have no form ... he is only a disciple, talking on a very much lower level, not understanding the higher standpoint of Massan.\nSHE SAID, “I AM NOT A GOD, I AM NOT A DEMON. WHAT COULD I CHANGE?” I have come\nto the point which never changes. That which changes, I have left behind. Man changes, woman changes. Everything that changes I have left behind.\nAT THIS, KANKEI KNELT DOWN, AND BECAME THE GARDENER OF MASSAN’S TEMPLE FOR THREE YEARS.\nAT ANOTHER TIME, GOEI WENT TO SEKITO AND SAID, “IF YOU CAN SAY A WORD, I WILL REMAIN HERE; OTHERWISE I WILL GO AWAY.”\nSEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, not saying a single word. Because silence is the only answer; it cannot be confined into a word. Sekito is answering, but the questioner is not able to understand that silence can also be an answer, that there are things which cannot be brought to the lower level of language, of words.\nThere are experiences for which you have to look in the eyes of the master. Perhaps you may see the moon reflected there. Perhaps in that silence when you are looking into the eyes of your master, something may transpire. You may become aware of your own inner flame.\nSEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, AND GOEI WENT OFF.\nHe did not understand the silent answer.\nFROM THE BACK SEKITO CALLED HIM – “WHERE! WHERE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” GOEI TURNED HIS HEAD.\nSEKITO SAID, “FROM BIRTH TO DEATH, IT IS JUST LIKE THIS – TURNING THE HEAD, TURNING THE BRAIN.\nHOW ABOUT IT?”\nGOEI WAS SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED, SO HE BROKE HIS STAFF.\nGoei used to carry a staff, and used to think that he had come to know – that he had become a master; the staff in Zen is carried only by the master. For the first time he looked into himself when Sekito asked him, “Where?” because it is here, so where are you going? It is within.\nIn a single moment of sudden awakening, he understood that up to now he has unnecessarily carried the staff; he was just a teacher, not a master. He broke his staff.\nThese are all symbolic things in Zen. Breaking the staff means, “Now you are the master and I’m the disciple. I will not say it in words, because words are very polluted; I will make the symbol that I’m no more a master. I was living in a false identity – I break that identity and throw it away. Now you are the master and I will live in your presence, drinking as much as possible the waters of life.”\nA poem of Chikusan reads:\nHE IS PART OF ALL, YET ALL IS TRANSCENDED; SOLELY FOR CONVENIENCE HE IS KNOWN AS MASTER. WHO DARES SAY HE HAS FOUND HIM?\nIN THIS RACKETY TOWN I TRAIN DISCIPLES.\nThese last lines are particularly important: IN THIS RACKETY TOWN I TRAIN DISCIPLES. He must have been in Poona! You cannot find a more rackety town. But strangely, masters have chosen rackety towns in search of a few intelligent people. The rackety town has a good quality: in the beginning it becomes a little disturbed, but slowly slowly it accepts that these people are a little different, and it does not bother.\nNow we are here, and in this rackety town, people will not be aware at all that five thousand people are in search of themselves, and sometimes they touch the very buddhahood, the pinnacle of consciousness. But they will go on standing in queues before movie houses, shopping in the marketplaces, never being aware ... It is a strange unconsciousness, that five thousand people from all over the world are gathered here – they must be doing something – but they won’t even look inside the gate. Such unconcern about the grandeur of man, such unconcern about the splendor of your innermost being.\nChosha wrote:\nEVERYTHING, EVERY PLACE IS REAL.\nEACH PARTICLE MAKES UP ORIGINAL MAN. STILL, THE ABSOLUTELY REAL IS VOICELESS,\nTHE TRUE BODY IS MAJESTICALLY OUT OF SIGHT.\nNeither can you say anything about the beauty, the majesty, nor can you see it with your ordinary eyes. When you turn inwards these eyes are closed; they can’t turn inwards. A third eye opens up – you have a new vision, a new clarity, which is not part of your two eyes. It is straightforward, it knows nothing as right or wrong; it simply knows what is.\nIt is voiceless, it cannot say ... it cannot tell you that you are carrying a great kingdom of God within you and you are behaving like a beggar, for small and petty things.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nRECENTLY I REALIZED THAT EXPECTATIONS VIOLATE THE FREEDOM, NOT OF THE ONE ON WHOM EXPECTATIONS ARE BEING PROJECTED, BUT ON ME – THE ONE HAVING THE EXPECTATIONS. WHEN I DROPPED MY EXPECTATIONS I FELT A BURDEN LIFTED, A SENSE OF BEING FREED.\nManeesha, drop that sense too, and then you will know pure freedom. Now you are ready to go inwards ... just a cup of tea.\n(A HEARTY LAUGH FROM SARDARJI ...)\nSardar Gurudayal Singh gets the joke before I tell it! He is really a miracle. And he is sitting just in the first row, with all his grandeur. It is very unique to get the joke before it is told. Most people don’t get it even when it is told. They laugh because others are laughing; very few people get it. But Sardar Gurudayal Singh is ahead .…\nNurdski is drunk, standing before the judge. “You are accused by your landlord of being drunk and setting fire to the bed,” says the judge.\n“Thash absolute nonshense,” slobbers Nurdski indignantly. “The bed was already on fire when I got into it!”\nYoung Maria Spumoni is getting married tomorrow. So, she comes to her mother as all good Catholic virgin girls are expected. “Mama,” says Maria, “I have-a to ask-a you something ...”\n“Yes-a,” interrupts her mother. “I know-a, my little tesoro. That’s-a why-a your mama is here. So let-a me tell you from my experience. Now that-a you have-a a man, treat-a him nice. On-a your first-a night, Oh blessed Virgin Mary! the things you will-a do. It will-a change your whole life-a ...”\n“No, no, mama,” cries Maria quickly. “I already know-a how-a to fuck-a, I just want-a to know how to make-a spaghetti!”\nTwo cannibals are sitting around the evening fire admiring a new Maytag refrigerator beside them. “What is the capacity of that fridge?” asks the first cannibal.\n“I’m not sure,” says the second cannibal. “I guess just a little more than those two guys who brought it!”\nGrandma Piebaker is out walking her dog, Queenie, when she decides to go into the local supermarket. She ties up Queenie outside, and then goes in to do some shopping. Almost immediately, every stray dog in the area is sniffing around the defenseless Queenie.\nThe local cop sees what is happening and goes to get Grandma Piebaker. “You can’t leave your dog alone there, lady,” says the cop.\n“Why not?” asks Grandma.\n“Lady,” says the cop, “your dog is in heat!” “Eat?” replies Grandma. “She will eat anything.”\n“No, lady,” says the cop, “your dog should be bred.”\n“Sure,” says Grandma, “she will eat bread, she will eat cake, she will eat anything.” In complete frustration, the cop shouts, “The dog should be laid!”\nGrandma stares angrily at the cop and says, “So lay her. I always wanted a police dog!”\nBefore Nivedano gives his beat for you to go completely crazy, you have to understand the meaning of throwing out your gibberish that is inside your mind, continuously movingYou are not even\naware of it. When you start throwing it out, then you become aware, “My god, all this bullshit I am carrying in my head!”\nAnd this is the best place to do it, because everybody else is engaged in throwing his bullshit. Nobody is listening to you. You won’t get this chance anywhere else in the world, so you can be absolutely at ease in exposing yourself. Just don’t sit silently, because anybody who is sitting silently – all this gibberish coming from everybody else will enter into his head! I am making you aware, it is a warning: don’t be stupid and don’t sit silently. Defeat all those who are around you. This is just a great chance!\nNivedano, give the first beat to the drum, and everybody goes crazy throwing his gibberish ... (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish)\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nBecome silent ... no movement, as if you are a frozen statue. You have thrown your dust out – don’t miss the moment.\nGo in.\nDeeper ... deeper.\nYour being is depthless; you can go as deep as you have courage and guts to go. The deeper you go, more you are.\nTo make this inwardness total ... Nivedano ...\n(Drumbeat) Everybody dies.\nFeel the body left behind.\nFeel the mind left behind and just enter into the unknown space. Just being ...\nTo be is the whole purpose of meditation.\nIn this moment there is no difference between you and the Buddha. Keep this moment alive twenty-four hours.\nDo whatever is needed to do, but don’t forget your immortal, eternal self, your universal being. Let it become your heartbeat, your very breathing.\nYou don’t have to do anything. Just a little remembrance.\nGreat and blessed is this space.\nGreat and blessed are you, to have found the essential religion, the very core of your nature.\nLive according to your nature and you will live in a dance. Your life will blossom many flowers.\nYou will come across much love, much compassion. You will share joy.\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nBring all the buddhas back to the body .…\nSit down, for a moment remembering the experience. This experiencing is Zen.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan all the buddhas celebrate now?

HE SAID TO
HIMSELF, “IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT, I WILL REMAIN THERE. IF IT
DOESN’T I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!”</p><p><br></p><p>HE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, “HAVE YOU
COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?”</p><p><br></p><p>IN RESPONSE, KANKEI SAID, “FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM,” SO MASSAN SAT
UPON HER SEAT, AND KANKEI APPROACHED HER.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE SAID, “WHERE DID YOU COME FROM TODAY, MAY I ASK?” KANKEI REPLIED,
“FROM ROKO.”</p><p>MASSAN THEN SAID TO KANKEI, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?”
KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND, MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?” SHE
ANSWERED, “IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PEAK.”</p><p>HE ASKED, “WHO IS MASSAN’S HUSBAND?”</p><p>SHE ANSWERED, “THERE IS NOT REAL FORM OF MEN AND WOMEN.”</p><p><br></p><p>HE SAID, “KWATZ!” AND ASKED, “WHY THEN DON’T YOU CHANGE AND
DISAPPEAR?” SHE SAID, “I AM NOT A GOD, I AM NOT A DEMON. WHAT COULD I
CHANGE?”</p><p>AT THIS, KANKEI KNELT DOWN, AND BECAME THE GARDENER OF MASSAN’S
TEMPLE FOR THREE YEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>AT ANOTHER TIME, GOEI WENT TO SEKITO AND SAID, “IF YOU CAN SAY A
WORD, I WILL REMAIN HERE; OTHERWISE I WILL GO AWAY.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, AND GOEI WENT OFF. FROM THE BACK, SEKITO
CALLED HIM, “JARI! JARI!” GOEI TURNED HIS HEAD.</p><p>SEKITO SAID, “FROM BIRTH TO DEATH, IT IS JUST LIKE THIS – TURNING THE
HEAD, TURNING THE BRAIN. HOW ABOUT IT?”</p><p><br></p><p>GOEI WAS SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED, SO HE BROKE HIS STAFF.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, entering into the world of Zen is not like any other
entering; it is entering in yourself. There is no door, and there is no
possibility of doing anything. You have simply to relax so totally that
you sink deep within yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, relaxation is not an activity. It is absence of all
activity. And only in the absence of all activity, when you are relaxed
to your very being, the door opens to all the mysteries of the world,
all the miracles of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It fills your being with great dance, although you cannot utter a
single word. You hear the music that you have never heard, although
there is no way to translate it to anyone else. You see flowers
blossoming ... their colors are absolutely unknown to you. Your whole
being becomes a fragrant luminosity. There is nothing to say about it;
you can just be it. And the rays of your silence will start creating and
weaving a field around you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why a master in Zen is not simply a teacher. In all the
religions there are only teachers. They teach you about subjects which
you don’t know, and they ask you to believe, because there is no way to
bring those experiences into objective reality. Neither has the teacher
known them – he has believed them; he transfers his belief to somebody
else. Zen is not a believer’s world. It is not for the faithful ones; it
is for those daring souls who can drop all belief, unbelief, doubt,
reason, mind, and simply enter into their pure existence without
boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>But it brings a tremendous transformation. Hence, let me say that
while others are involved in philosophies, Zen is involved in a
metamorphosis, in a transformation. It is authentic alchemy: it changes
you from base metal into gold. But its language has to be understood,
not with your</p><p>reasoning and intellectual mind but with your loving heart. Or even
just listening, not bothering whether it is true or not. And a moment
comes suddenly that you see it, which has been eluding you your whole
life. Suddenly, what Gautam Buddha called “eighty-four thousand doors”
open.</p><p><br></p><p>These anecdotes, when first translated by Christian missionaries,
were translated to show the world that “Christianity is the only
civilized religion, and as a proof look at these stupid dialogues, with
no reason and no rhyme!” But everything backfired. They wanted to prove
Zen to be a very primitive religion. But to those who were real seekers,
it proved that on the contrary, every other religion may be primitive;
at least Zen is not.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place, it is not a religion at all. It is not in
competition with Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism or Mohammedanism;
it does not belong to that category at all. It has its own category, its
own language, its own world, and there is no competitor to it. Its
uniqueness is absolute and categorical.</p><p><br></p><p>But you will have to be very loving, very careful in understanding
these strange dialogues, because the language seems to be the same as we
use but hidden between the words and between the lines there is a
different poetry, a different song, which we are not accustomed to.</p><p><br></p><p>But my people will understand it, because we are entering into the
same space which Zen has been pointing towards. These dialogues can be
understood only by meditators; otherwise they look stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK, KANKEI, ONCE VISITED THE NUN, MASSAN RYONEN. HE SAID TO
HIMSELF, “IF WHAT SHE SAYS HITS THE SPOT, I WILL REMAIN THERE. IF IT
DOES NOT, I WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT!”</p><p><br></p><p>He was a seeker in search of a master, and when he came to see Massan
Ryonen, a woman Zen master, he thought in his own mind, IF WHAT SHE SAYS
HITS THE SPOT ... it is not a question of reasonability. Not that what
she is saying is very wise, but if it hits the spot, my own being – if
the arrow of what she says reaches to my being, I will stay; otherwise I
WILL OVERTURN THE ZEN SEAT.</p><p><br></p><p>When a disciple comes, a seat is offered by the master for him to
sit. And if the disciple rejects the master, he overturns the seat
gracefully – showing that “this is not my place” – and leaves. That
overturning of the Zen seat is symbolic that “I don’t accept you as a
master, but I will not say it. Saying is so crude. I will just give you
the hint, that you could not hit the spot of my being, for which I am
searching; I will have to go to another master.”</p><p><br></p><p>HE ENTERED THE HALL, AND MASSAN SENT A MESSENGER TO ASK, “HAVE YOU
COME ON A MOUNTAIN-VIEWING JOURNEY, OR FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM?”</p><p><br></p><p>IN RESPONSE, KANKEI SAID, “FOR THE SAKE OF BUDDHISM,” SO MASSAN SAT
UPON HER SEAT, AND KANKEI APPROACHED HER.</p><p>SHE SAID, “WHERE DID YOU COME FROM TODAY, MAY I ASK?” KANKEI REPLIED,
“FROM ROKO.”</p><p>MASSAN THEN SAID TO KANKEI, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?”
KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND, MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?”</p><p>The bamboo hat has to be removed in grace and gratitude when you
encounter a master. The removing of the hat is simply signifying that “I
am available, in humbleness, open; I’m not covered or defensive. Even if
you want to cut my head, I am ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the first court in America where my case was presented after I was
illegally arrested, the woman magistrate was in a puzzle – because in
America, you cannot wear your hat in the court. Wearing your hat in the
court is insulting the court. Such are the different attitudes of East
and West.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see that she was a little bit puzzled what to do. She sent an
attendant to tell me, “Perhaps you don’t know that in the court you have
to remove your hat. To keep your hat on is to insult the court.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “Go back to the magistrate and tell her that if she
has courage, she should ask the question herself. Because according to
me, to remove the hat is insulting and I will not insult the court.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man thought for a moment, went back to the magistrate. The woman
was even more puzzled! She simply thought it was better not to get into
an argument. Because it is not written in the constitution; it is just a
formal tradition. I am not legally bound to remove my hat. I will remove
my hat only when I see a buddha – not for a magistrate. Seeing the
situation, the woman behaved sanely. She said to the attendant, “There
is no need, just don’t raise the question again.” Different worlds,
different symbols .…</p><p><br></p><p>When Massan asked, “WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE YOUR BAMBOO HAT?” she was
saying that if you have come for the sake of Buddhism – and that means
for the search of the buddha within you – then be graceful. Remove the
hat, be humble and be receptive.</p><p><br></p><p>KANKEI HAD NO REPLY, AND MAKING HIS BOWS, ASKED, “WHAT IS MASSAN?”
Massan was</p><p>the woman master’s name.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE ANSWERED, “IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PEAK.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman got the name Massan because of the Massan Mountain where
she had her monastery. The peaks are so high that they are almost always
covered with snow and clouds; they rarely show. And that is exactly the
situation of consciousness. It is so much covered with thoughts – the
past, the conditionings ... so much smoke – that it rarely shows.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the beauty of Zen, that ordinary questions are suddenly
turned to immense significance. HE ASKED, “WHO IS MASSAN’S HUSBAND?”</p><p>SHE ANSWERED, “THERE IS NOT REAL FORM OF MEN AND WOMEN.”</p><p>The difference and discrimination between men and women is only
phenomenal, it is not authentic. It does not have a spirituality to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And now we know that science can convert men into women, women into
men, and there are thousands of people around the world who have changed
their sex – just bored! One gets bored: a woman every day, a woman
again, and again. A man ... in the morning again you wake up a man. And
one starts thinking, is there some way to change?</p><p><br></p><p>People change clothes, people change shoes, people change ties. Up to
now it was not possible, but now it is possible – many, many more people
are going to change their sex. For the first time, a man will be
standing behind a woman’s body, or a woman may be standing behind a
man’s body. And then they will understand what mystics have always been
saying, that the inside is the same; only the window and its frame is
different.</p><p><br></p><p>Your inner being is neither male nor female.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to this, the monk said, or rather shouted, the Zen shout
“KWATZ!” AND ASKED, “WHY THEN DON’T YOU CHANGE AND DISAPPEAR?”</p><p><br></p><p>If men and women have no form ... he is only a disciple, talking on a
very much lower level, not understanding the higher standpoint of
Massan.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE SAID, “I AM NOT A GOD, I AM NOT A DEMON. WHAT COULD I CHANGE?” I
have come</p><p>to the point which never changes. That which changes, I have left
behind. Man changes, woman changes. Everything that changes I have left
behind.</p><p><br></p><p>AT THIS, KANKEI KNELT DOWN, AND BECAME THE GARDENER OF MASSAN’S
TEMPLE FOR THREE YEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>AT ANOTHER TIME, GOEI WENT TO SEKITO AND SAID, “IF YOU CAN SAY A
WORD, I WILL REMAIN HERE; OTHERWISE I WILL GO AWAY.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, not saying a single word. Because silence is
the only answer; it cannot be confined into a word. Sekito is answering,
but the questioner is not able to understand that silence can also be an
answer, that there are things which cannot be brought to the lower level
of language, of words.</p><p><br></p><p>There are experiences for which you have to look in the eyes of the
master. Perhaps you may see the moon reflected there. Perhaps in that
silence when you are looking into the eyes of your master, something may
transpire. You may become aware of your own inner flame.</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO SIMPLY SAT THERE, AND GOEI WENT OFF.</p><p><br></p><p>He did not understand the silent answer.</p><p>FROM THE BACK SEKITO CALLED HIM – “WHERE! WHERE! WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?” GOEI TURNED HIS HEAD.</p><p>SEKITO SAID, “FROM BIRTH TO DEATH, IT IS JUST LIKE THIS – TURNING THE
HEAD, TURNING THE BRAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW ABOUT IT?”</p><p><br></p><p>GOEI WAS SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED, SO HE BROKE HIS STAFF.</p><p><br></p><p>Goei used to carry a staff, and used to think that he had come to
know – that he had become a master; the staff in Zen is carried only by
the master. For the first time he looked into himself when Sekito asked
him, “Where?” because it is here, so where are you going? It is
within.</p><p><br></p><p>In a single moment of sudden awakening, he understood that up to now
he has unnecessarily carried the staff; he was just a teacher, not a
master. He broke his staff.</p><p><br></p><p>These are all symbolic things in Zen. Breaking the staff means, “Now
you are the master and I’m the disciple. I will not say it in words,
because words are very polluted; I will make the symbol that I’m no more
a master. I was living in a false identity – I break that identity and
throw it away. Now you are the master and I will live in your presence,
drinking as much as possible the waters of life.”</p><p><br></p><p>A poem of Chikusan reads:</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS PART OF ALL, YET ALL IS TRANSCENDED; SOLELY FOR CONVENIENCE HE
IS KNOWN AS MASTER. WHO DARES SAY HE HAS FOUND HIM?</p><p>IN THIS RACKETY TOWN I TRAIN DISCIPLES.</p><p>These last lines are particularly important: IN THIS RACKETY TOWN I
TRAIN DISCIPLES. He must have been in Poona! You cannot find a more
rackety town. But strangely, masters have chosen rackety towns in search
of a few intelligent people. The rackety town has a good quality: in the
beginning it becomes a little disturbed, but slowly slowly it accepts
that these people are a little different, and it does not bother.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we are here, and in this rackety town, people will not be aware
at all that five thousand people are in search of themselves, and
sometimes they touch the very buddhahood, the pinnacle of consciousness.
But they will go on standing in queues before movie houses, shopping in
the marketplaces, never being aware ... It is a strange unconsciousness,
that five thousand people from all over the world are gathered here –
they must be doing something – but they won’t even look inside the gate.
Such unconcern about the grandeur of man, such unconcern about the
splendor of your innermost being.</p><p><br></p><p>Chosha wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>EVERYTHING, EVERY PLACE IS REAL.</p><p>EACH PARTICLE MAKES UP ORIGINAL MAN. STILL, THE ABSOLUTELY REAL IS
VOICELESS,</p><p>THE TRUE BODY IS MAJESTICALLY OUT OF SIGHT.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither can you say anything about the beauty, the majesty, nor can
you see it with your ordinary eyes. When you turn inwards these eyes are
closed; they can’t turn inwards. A third eye opens up – you have a new
vision, a new clarity, which is not part of your two eyes. It is
straightforward, it knows nothing as right or wrong; it simply knows
what is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is voiceless, it cannot say ... it cannot tell you that you are
carrying a great kingdom of God within you and you are behaving like a
beggar, for small and petty things.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>RECENTLY I REALIZED THAT EXPECTATIONS VIOLATE THE FREEDOM, NOT OF THE
ONE ON WHOM EXPECTATIONS ARE BEING PROJECTED, BUT ON ME – THE ONE HAVING
THE EXPECTATIONS. WHEN I DROPPED MY EXPECTATIONS I FELT A BURDEN LIFTED,
A SENSE OF BEING FREED.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, drop that sense too, and then you will know pure freedom.
Now you are ready to go inwards ... just a cup of tea.</p><p>(A HEARTY LAUGH FROM SARDARJI ...)</p><p><br></p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh gets the joke before I tell it! He is really a
miracle. And he is sitting just in the first row, with all his grandeur.
It is very unique to get the joke before it is told. Most people don’t
get it even when it is told. They laugh because others are laughing;
very few people get it. But Sardar Gurudayal Singh is ahead .…</p><p><br></p><p>Nurdski is drunk, standing before the judge. “You are accused by your
landlord of being drunk and setting fire to the bed,” says the
judge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thash absolute nonshense,” slobbers Nurdski indignantly. “The bed
was already on fire when I got into it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Young Maria Spumoni is getting married tomorrow. So, she comes to her
mother as all good Catholic virgin girls are expected. “Mama,” says
Maria, “I have-a to ask-a you something ...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes-a,” interrupts her mother. “I know-a, my little tesoro. That’s-a
why-a your mama is here. So let-a me tell you from my experience. Now
that-a you have-a a man, treat-a him nice. On-a your first-a night, Oh
blessed Virgin Mary! the things you will-a do. It will-a change your
whole life-a ...”</p><p>“No, no, mama,” cries Maria quickly. “I already know-a how-a to
fuck-a, I just want-a to know how to make-a spaghetti!”</p><p><br></p><p>Two cannibals are sitting around the evening fire admiring a new
Maytag refrigerator beside them. “What is the capacity of that fridge?”
asks the first cannibal.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” says the second cannibal. “I guess just a little more
than those two guys who brought it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma Piebaker is out walking her dog, Queenie, when she decides to
go into the local supermarket. She ties up Queenie outside, and then
goes in to do some shopping. Almost immediately, every stray dog in the
area is sniffing around the defenseless Queenie.</p><p><br></p><p>The local cop sees what is happening and goes to get Grandma
Piebaker. “You can’t leave your dog alone there, lady,” says the
cop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not?” asks Grandma.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lady,” says the cop, “your dog is in heat!” “Eat?” replies Grandma.
“She will eat anything.”</p><p>“No, lady,” says the cop, “your dog should be bred.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” says Grandma, “she will eat bread, she will eat cake, she
will eat anything.” In complete frustration, the cop shouts, “The dog
should be laid!”</p><p>Grandma stares angrily at the cop and says, “So lay her. I always
wanted a police dog!”</p><p><br></p><p>Before Nivedano gives his beat for you to go completely crazy, you
have to understand the meaning of throwing out your gibberish that is
inside your mind, continuously moving<span class=s4></span>You are not
even</p><p>aware of it. When you start throwing it out, then you become aware,
“My god, all this bullshit I am carrying in my head!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the best place to do it, because everybody else is
engaged in throwing his bullshit. Nobody is listening to you. You won’t
get this chance anywhere else in the world, so you can be absolutely at
ease in exposing yourself. Just don’t sit silently, because anybody who
is sitting silently – all this gibberish coming from everybody else will
enter into his head! I am making you aware, it is a warning: don’t be
stupid and don’t sit silently. Defeat all those who are around you. This
is just a great chance!</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano, give the first beat to the drum, and everybody goes crazy
throwing his gibberish ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish)</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Become silent ... no movement, as if you are a frozen statue. You
have thrown your dust out – don’t miss the moment.</p><p>Go in.</p><p><br></p><p>Deeper ... deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>Your being is depthless; you can go as deep as you have courage and
guts to go. The deeper you go, more you are.</p><p>To make this inwardness total ... Nivedano ...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Everybody dies.</p><p>Feel the body left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel the mind left behind and just enter into the unknown space. Just
being ...</p><p>To be is the whole purpose of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>In this moment there is no difference between you and the Buddha.
Keep this moment alive twenty-four hours.</p><p>Do whatever is needed to do, but don’t forget your immortal, eternal
self, your universal being. Let it become your heartbeat, your very
breathing.</p><p>You don’t have to do anything. Just a little remembrance.</p><p>Great and blessed is this space.</p><p><br></p><p>Great and blessed are you, to have found the essential religion, the
very core of your nature.</p><p>Live according to your nature and you will live in a dance. Your life
will blossom many flowers.</p><p>You will come across much love, much compassion. You will share
joy.</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Bring all the buddhas back to the body .…</p><p><br></p><p>Sit down, for a moment remembering the experience. This experiencing
is Zen.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can all the buddhas celebrate now? Yes!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

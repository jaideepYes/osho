Tomorrow will be too late, so I have to deal with it today.\nI used to think that idiots don’t grow, they always remain idiots. Today I found that they do grow – they become more idiotic. The whole credit goes to that old goat of Puri, the Shankaracharya. For almost two weeks he had been insisting that no untouchable, no sudra can enter into the temple of Nath Dwara. It will destroy the purity of thousands of years; no sudra has ever entered it.\nHe has even challenged me to a discussion on the point; and he has asserted in a press conference that he is ready to be arrested, but he won’t allow any untouchable to enter the temple of Nath Dwara. But in these ten days, from every nook and corner of the country, he has been bombarded. He was hoping at least that the orthodox will support him, but they have remained silent.\nNo intelligent man can support him. Seeing that the situation is getting out of hand, today he has made a statement, that “I have been misrepresented.”\nHundreds of newspapers in all the thirty languages of this country for ten days continuously have been misrepresenting him and he has been silent. Now he has come with a new statement and the statement is, “I never said that harijans, the untouchables, cannot enter Nath Dwara. I said they do not need to enter Nath Dwara; they are God’s people” – the word ‘harijan’ means God’s people – “and they don’t have to go to any temple, God will come to them himself.”\nIn the first place no Hindu scripture calls them harijans, they are called sudras, untouchables. The word ‘harijan’ was invented by Mahatma Gandhi for his own politics. Sometimes just by changing a name a great consolation comes. He started calling the sudras God’s own people, but nothing changed. And it is very strange that God’s own people should always suffer and the others, who are not God’s own people, should enjoy richness, respectability and all the advantages that are available.\nBut harijans were happy to lose their name ‘untouchable’. It means that they are so dirty that they cannot even be touched, not even their shadow can be touched. If you touch their shadow, you will\nhave to go through a purification process, you will have to call brahmins, you will have to take a bath in the Ganges, you will have to be surrounded by priests chanting mantras, and only then will you be back again to your own caste; otherwise you have fallen, you have touched the shadow of a sudra.\nBut with the changing of their name to harijans, God’s own people, sudras felt very good, very consoled. This is how the politicians and the priests work. In reality nothing changes, just the label. But now it makes them feel that they ARE God’s own people.\nThis Shankaracharya of Puri is saying something which is even more stupid than his earlier statement that he will prevent harijans from entering Nath Dwara. Now he is saying, “They are God’s own people, God will come to them.”\nI want to ask him – what about others? What about himself? Why are others going to the temples? Nobody should go. At least the temple of Puri should be closed to the Shankaracharya. If God is going to come to people of his own choice, then the brahmins – who have been the people of his choice for thousands of years – should not go to the temples. In fact nobody should go. I agree perfectly, there is no need. These temples should be changed into schools, into hospitals, into anything utilitarian. They have accumulated most of the money of the country, and it should be used for schools and colleges.\nNow he will be in more difficulty. If God comes to meet his own people, the Shankaracharya has saved himself from his previous statement but he has put himself into a more difficult and complex position. Now all the Hindus other than sudras should ask him, “What about us? Is God going to meet us outside of the temple or in the temple? If he meets the harijans – who have been for thousands of years condemned – outside of the temple, then why should we go to the temple?”\nThen in fact the very necessity for temples is no longer there. God has to be met outside under the trees, under the stars.\nUp to now the Shankaracharya was against harijans, and he is still against them. He thinks he is being a great politician by saying that they need not go to the temples. But I want to create more difficulty for him. All the remaining Hindus should ask him, “What about us – you are putting us lower than the sudras. What about yourself? Why do you go to the temple? And what is the need of all your scriptures?”\nJust meet God outside in the open air, by the sea, by the side of the river, anywhere. Wherever you remember him, he will be there. If he can come to meet the untouchables ... you are touchables, he can even touch you.\nBecause of this I have had to change my standpoint. I used to think that retarded people never grow. They grow. They become more retarded! The Shankaracharya is a living example. Now he has to tell the whole country what the status is of temples and scriptures and what need there is of worship, yagnas, statues, and what need there is of caste. If sudras are people of God, then others also are people of God; or do you want to say that only harijans are people of God and others are not even cousin-brothers to harijans?\nThis fellow should be put right. He is getting more and more senile, he needs to be hospitalized. And if nobody allows him, I am ready to allow him here and we will give him a good round of therapies\nand cleanse him of all this nonsense that he has been carrying. There is no need for him to be arrested and become a martyr, he is simply sick!\nBut he will not realize it. He will have to be forced to realize that he is suffering from psychological illness. He should renounce the post of Shankaracharya and just get entered into a madhouse, where he will find very similar souls, speaking the same language – which nobody understands.\nOne of my friends, Narendra’s father, had a strange illness. Six months of the year he used to be mad and the remaining six months he was absolutely sane. Whenever he was sane he was ill, with always this problem and that problem and a headache and a stomachache, and he looked very sad. But whenever he became mad he was perfectly healthy, no sign of any sickness.\nOnce when he was perfectly mad and healthy he escaped from the house. He was caught by the police in Agra, where the Taj Mahal is, because of a very strange linguistic problem. He entered a sweet shop. There is a sweet which is called khaja. But ‘khaja’ also means, ‘eat it’. He asked the shopkeeper what it was, and the shopkeeper said “khaja” so he started eating it.\nThe man said, “Are you mad?”\nHe said, “You must be mad, you told me ‘khaja’.”\nA crowd gathered and the police came and he was brought to the magistrate and the magistrate was also at a loss, because the poor fellow was not wrong – why did they make such names for sweets? He was simply following what the shopkeeper said.\nBut by asking other questions he figured out that he was mad. He was sentenced to the madhouse for six months. But they did not know his psychological history, that three months of his madness were over and after three months he would become sane on his own. There was no problem, it was simply a swing from madness to sanity, from sanity to madness. His whole life he had been on the swing.\nSo in the madhouse the first three months were perfect. He enjoyed himself with all the mad people, he loved the place. But in his madness he drank something that was brought to clean the toilets. He drank the whole bottle. He suffered for days from diarrhea and vomiting. But because of this diarrhea and vomiting, within fifteen days he became sane. All heat went out of him; he became completely calm and quiet.\nAnd then he became afraid, surrounded by all the mad people – somebody was pulling his hair, somebody was trying to put a finger into his ear, somebody was sitting on his shoulders. It had all been good up to that point, but now he tried hard to convince the superintendent that, “I am no longer mad.”\nThe superintendent said, “Don’t bother me, every madman says that. That is no argument! You will have to remain here until you fulfill your sentence of six months.”\nHe said, “In three months these mad people and you will kill me! It was good before, immensely good, I was enjoying it. Why did you bring this bottle here?”\nBut he had to suffer, law is law. When he came out I asked him, “Uncle, how have things been?”\nHe was very friendly to everybody, and except for his family everybody enjoyed him. The family was suffering, because he was stealing things and distributing them to the beggars, borrowing money from anywhere and the family had to pay it, purchasing anything that he wanted.\nHe was a great shopper, all kinds of junk, it did not matter what it was. Just if it was cheap, he would purchase it.\nSo the family was in difficulty. I remember Narendra was so small, but these small children used to watch him and shout to their mother, “He is trying to take something away, he is trying to open the locker.” Everybody was on watch.\nHe said to me, “Everything was so good for three months. I enjoyed it, I had found my people. But when I became sane, I found that these were not my people.”\nI hope that the Shankaracharya of Puri, in any madhouse, will find his friends with similar ideas. He will enjoy it. It is not going to be a suffering or a punishment, it will be a promotion. And to leave him out in this insane condition is harmful to society. For the sake of society he should be forced into a psychiatric clinic.\nI never thought that after ten days he would start lying. Now he says he never made any such statements and thousands of newspapers all over India have been misrepresenting him. If one paper had done it one could believe it, but these thousands of papers cannot be in a conspiracy. And they are all owned by high-caste Hindus – they were ashamed that he was making such statements.\nThe untouchables have been kept out of the temples; there is no need to make statements, no need to make any fuss about it. In fact they themselves don’t go. Other politicians are trying to persuade them to enter into the temples, but they know that they will be beaten, they know that their houses will be burned, they know that their women will be raped. They know perfectly well that the police will stand there in favor of the richer high-class Hindus, and nobody is going to protect them. But politicians use human beings just like things, commodities.\nThe politicians who are trying to get them to enter the temple, their whole object is to have their vote, temple or no temple. They want the harijans to be rejected from the temple so that they can sympathize with them, “We have made every effort for you, we risked our lives; now at least give us your votes.”\nAnd the Shankaracharya was defending the higher class Hindus, who are three times more numerous than the sudras. His interest is also in votes. Just two days ago he said, “Perhaps I will have to enter into politics.” It is better that he enters. At least this mask of a religious saint will drop and he will be just an ordinary gutter politician. It will be a great day of celebration – at least we will celebrate. He should drop his Shankaracharyahood and run for election. But he should not lie to people or make such stupid statements.\nEverybody is as divine as everybody else. There cannot be any distinction. Anybody who makes a distinction is the enemy of the people.\nManeesha has brought a beautiful, very significant dialogue:\nHOFUKU SAID, “THERE IS A MAN NOW PASSING BEHIND THE BUDDHA HALL, AND HE KNOWS THIS IS TOM, THIS IS DICK, OR THIS IS HARRY.”\nStrangely enough, when I entered I found three women, not three men, just walking behind the Buddha Hall. But times have changed. And it does not matter who was walking, the question can still be asked.\n“AND THERE IS A MAN PASSING BEFORE THE BUDDHA HALL. SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE SEES NOTHING AND NOBODY. TELL ME, WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM?”\nHe is asking, in other words, to make it simple: “These persons I see behind the Buddha Hall, the person I see in front – they seem to be almost frozen statues. They must be in meditation. They don’t see anything, they don’t bother about anything.” This man Hofuku, the master of the temple, is asking, “WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM if people become so careless that you pass in front of them and they don’t even look at you – as if nobody has passed? They are so self-centered that the whole world outside has disappeared. Then what is the point of Buddhism? Is this a loss or a profit?”\nA MONK SAID, “BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES THINGS BADLY, IT MEANS HE CAN’T SEE.”\nHOFUKU SAID, “KWATZ!” to the monk who was giving this answer – because he divides things into good and bad, into black and white, into dead and alive. He cannot see what those persons are doing.\nHofuku shouted the Zen KWATZ! which is equivalent to the stick hitting your head. Because the master cannot always carry the stick, they found an equivalent. And certainly when a Zen monk or master shouts “Kwatz!” it hits harder than any stick can. It keeps you utterly silent – “What happened? Why has he started shouting in a strange way, a sound which means nothing?” But it can wake you. Any sound, meaningless or meaningful, can wake you up.\nThe Zen experience is that certain sounds reach into certain centers of your being. That is the experience of all the mystics of the world. For example, Sufis have found the sound HOO. If you repeat “Hoo” continuously, you will find that the center of your life, just two inches below your navel, is hit again and again. Soon there will be sparks coming out of your life center.\nIn this country, they have found OM – which is mild, in accordance with the character of the people who have lived in this country. It does not hit very hard, but it pushes. “Om, Om,” again and again – it pushes you into a different space that is not mind.\nZen has found KWATZ – it is like their character, their training, their samuraihood. They are warriors. “Kwatz!” – it hits exactly the same center as “Hoo.” When you greet each other with “Yaa-Hoo,” you are hitting the same center.\nHOFUKU SAID, “IF THIS IS THE BUDDHA HALL, HE CAN’T SEE.”\nTHE MONK SAID, “IF IT WASN’T THE BUDDHA HALL, HE COULD SEE ALL RIGHT!”\nHOFUKU SAID, “IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE ANYTHING.”\nNow in the language of Zen, anything and nothing are equivalent. To see nothing is to see all because nothing is the very source of all. The question is about the Buddha Hall. The monk is saying that if these people were not in the Buddha Hall, they could see everything. You all see everything outside the Buddha Hall, but in the Buddha Hall, you stop seeing all kinds of stupid things. You become almost blind to the world. Your eyes turn inwards. You start seeing only your own being as if nothing else exists.\nHOFUKU SAID, “IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE ANYTHING.”\nA very illogical dialogue, but if you understand, I have made it absolutely logical. Sitting like a buddha, you stop seeing the whole world because you start seeing your inner being. And running around seeing things, you forget all about yourself.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO BOKUSHU, “I BEG YOU TO EXPOUND TO ME THE GREAT MEANING OF BUDDHISM.”\nBOKUSHU SAID, “YOU BRING IT TO ME, AND I’LL EXPOUND IT.”\nThese were great masters. You cannot drag them into intellectual thinking; you cannot drag them down from their hilltops, from their watching silence. He says, “You bring it to me. You want to understand Buddhism? Just bring it here.” Now, nobody can bring Buddhism, it is not a thing. “Bring it to me and I will expound it. And if you cannot bring it, I am sorry.”\nThe monk said, “Please, don’t ask such an impossible thing. Just tell me the meaning of Buddhism.”\nBOKUSHU SAID, “WHEN WE BREAK THE EASTERN HEDGE, WE MUST MEND THE WESTERN FENCE.”\nBy saying this, he is saying, “A dialogue between me and you is almost impossible. It is like a man whose eastern hedge is broken and he starts mending the western fence. He is an idiot. You are doing the same. The only way I can expound Buddhism is if you bring it to me.”\nHow can one bring Buddhism? If one comes in silence and stillness and sits by the side of the master without even asking, just waiting in deep trust and love, the very presence of the master will become a great sermon.\nZen is not a theorization, it is not some philosophy. It is a very real experience, almost tangible, but you have to understand its way. If you are open, silent, the master will pour all that he has. But in words you can get lost, you will not understand the essence of being a buddha.\nThe only way is to be.\nA MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS THIS EYE OF THE ONE WHO NEVER SLEEPS?”\nIt reminds me of a night twenty-five centuries ago .…\nWhen Gautam Buddha was alive, he used to always sleep in the same posture; and the whole night, he would not move from side to side, he would not change his posture, not even an inch. Just nearby, in the Ajanta caves, in the last cave there is a sculpture of Gautam Buddha sleeping. That pose has become known as the ‘Lion’s pose’ because the lion also sleeps on its side without moving.\nAnanda was very much troubled because every night he could see – sometimes in the middle of the night he would wake up – that Buddha was absolutely still, just as he had always been. One night, he could not resist the temptation.\nHe said, “It is not good to disturb you in the night, because the whole day you have been walking and teaching, but I cannot resist. For twenty years I have been watching. You can understand how long I have waited, but now I have to ask it anyway. How do you manage to remain in the same posture that you go to sleep in, the same posture for the whole night? Do you sleep or do you simply go on keeping the posture? – because I have to move continuously.”\nGautam Buddha said, “I have found the right posture. Now there is no need to change it. And I am as awake as anyone, even while my body is asleep. I have found the right posture for the body ... you are still searching for it. It is not simply a question of tossing and turning the body, it is because your mind is tossing and turning. I have gone beyond – there is no mind. The body simply lies down like a corpse. Have you ever seen any corpse changing its posture?”\nIn one story a woman reached to the Pearly Gates. And as Saint Peter opened the door, she asked immediately about her husband, “Where is Tom?”\nSaint Peter said, “Dear lady, there must be millions of Toms. You will have to describe him to me in detail. Just tell me something about which Tom, and I will try my best to find him.”\nShe said, “I don’t know how to describe him. Only one thing I remember is that when he died, before dying he said, ‘Remember not to be unfaithful to me because if you are, I will toss and turn in my grave.’”\nSaint Peter said, “Aha, don’t be worried. He is a well-known figure here. We call him Whirling Tom. I will find him for you. Somewhere he must be whirling.”\nIt is your mind. Once your mind is at rest, once it disappears, your body can remain asleep but your inner eye, your inner sensitivity, your awareness, can remain burning like a small flame – not only watching your body, but also watching the silent mind, and the stillness surrounding you. The enlightened man cannot sleep in the same way that the unenlightened one sleeps. When the unenlightened man sleeps, he is simply unconscious. The enlightened man sleeps but he is not unconscious.\nJOSHU SAID, “THE PHYSICAL EYE OF THE ORDINARY MAN.” HE ADDED, “THOUGH HE MAY BE SAID NOT YET TO HAVE THE SPIRITUAL EYE, THE PHYSICAL EYE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SAME THING.”\nThe question is that if your mind is silent then even your physical eyes stop moving. You can try it as an experiment. This is the way that psychoanalysts find out whether a sleeping person is\ndreaming or not. And now, there is much research going on about dreams and dreamless sleep. It has completely overturned the ancient idea. The old idea was that there are a few dreams once in a while, mostly early in the morning when you are going to wake up; otherwise, you sleep soundly.\nModern research says that you dream six hours out of eight. If you sleep eight hours, then for six hours you dream. Those two hours of dreamless sleep are also not solid, but broken here and there – ten minutes here, fifteen minutes there. But this proportion had never been mentioned anywhere in the world before.\nAnd the second revolutionary discovery which has come out of it is that when you are watching somebody sleeping, you can know the type of sleep just by looking at his eyes. They are closed, but if he is dreaming, then you can see that under the eyelids, the eyes are moving. That movement is absolutely clear. It is just like when you read, you have to move your eyes; when you see a film, you have to move your eyes. Dreaming is a kind of film running on the screen of your mind, and the eyes have to move with it.\nThe traditional wisdom was that if you don’t dream very much, it is a sign of health. The modern researchers have found just the opposite – of course this research is done with ordinary people, not those who are meditating, otherwise the results would be different. They have found that dreaming is a way of throwing away all the dust that people have gathered during the day. If they don’t dream they will go mad, because every day the dust will go on collecting. Soon they will be surrounded by dust, thick layers of thought, incomplete experiences, all kinds of junk, and they will not be able to find the way out and come back home. Every day, just as you take a bath or clean your teeth, your mind automatically tries to throw away all kinds of dust that has gathered during the day. This needs six hours, so the healthy man dreams six hours and sleeps two hours.\nThat brings many implications. The researchers have been experimenting with a few people in one lab, and a few people in another labIn one lab they try to disturb the people whenever they start\ndreaming. Whenever they see that their eyes are moving, they wake them up. In the other lab, they wake them up whenever their eyes are not moving. In one lab they disturb their sleep, and in the other they disturb their dreams. And the strange result is that the people whose sleep is disturbed and whose dreams are allowed, wake up profoundly refreshed without any trouble. And the people whose dreams are disturbed and whose sleep is allowed, wake up utterly tired, tattered. It seems that dreams are more significant than sleep. But this research is only confined to non-meditators.\nA meditator throws away all the dust himself, he does not wait for the biological sleep to throw it away. He throws it away consciously and with full awareness. Then his sleep becomes a deep silence and also a deep awareness. This awareness has been called the third eye, but the third eye is only a symbol.\nWhat we are doing here every day in meditationwithin two minutes you are throwing away almost\nsix hours’ load. It is a question of totality. Don’t hold back, don’t think of what people will think about you. Here, there is nobody even listening to you. Everybody is so much involved in himself and everybody is competing with everybody else! This throwing away gibberish will reduce your dreams, and if you were brought to be examined for your sleep, the results would be different. Your dreams would be far less and your sleep would be longer.\nAnd a new factor will have arisen in you: a thin line of awareness, which as you go on growing in meditation becomes bigger and bigger. A point comes in that fire of your awareness where all your dreams burn, and only sleep is left. The body sleeps, it is tired – it needs rest. But your consciousness is never tired. It burns bright, day in, day out.\nTHE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE EYE OF THE ONE WHO SLEEPS?”\nJOSHU SAID, “THE BUDDHA EYE; THE EYE OF THE LAW IS THE EYE OF HIM WHO SLEEPS.”\nIn fact, your sleep is as insane as your waking. Just consider for a moment: is your waking sane? Are not insane thoughts moving inside you – anger and greed and hate and possessiveness? And thousands are the names of all the kinds of madnesses that are going on inside you, although you are trying to hide them. You are wearing a mask; just as you are hiding your body with clothes, you are hiding your mind with smiles, with thoughts, talking with people. Your conversations are nothing but distractions, distractions of your insane mind.\nI traveled in this country for almost twenty years. And it was an experience, because I traveled only in the air-conditioned coupe, so once in a while there was another passenger but otherwise I was alone. The other person would usually try to make some conversation immediately ... and I had a beautiful opportunity. I would tell him my name, my father’s name, my father’s father’s name, how many brothers my father has, how many children my uncles have. And he would be amazed because he had simply asked me my name.\nI would say, “You were going to ask all these things. I am settling everything right now, so we can be silent. Twenty-four hours we are going to be together ...”\nThe man would look at me a little strangely, but I would close my eyes. Once in a while, I would open them and see what he was doing.\nThese travelings have been my labs with thousands of people. I have not missed a single moment of watching and seeing what is happening. The man will read the same newspaper again and again and will start getting angry – angry at me, but he cannot say it, because I have told him, “Don’t say a single word. All inquiry is finished. I have told you everything about me; more than that, I don’t know either.”\nHe will open his suitcase and close his suitcase, open the window and close the window. And I am watching. And in an air-conditioned compartment, he will start perspiring, he will call the conductor, “Can you change my place to some other compartment? Because I am going to go mad.”\nThe conductor said, “I don’t see what is bothering you.”\nHe said, “That is the problem! Nobody is bothering me. This fellow is simply sitting and looking at me as if I am an experimental zoo. And I am behaving insanely, I know. But because of him I have to do something, otherwise ... And he has closed the conversation from the very beginning. No conversation! So I am reading the same newspaper and getting angry. I open the suitcase and I know there is no need to open it; I put my clothes this way and that way but what is the point? I go unnecessarily to the bathroom and then I look stupid ... ‘This is strange, you don’t have anything to do in the bathroom. Why are you going?’”\nAlmost all the conductors knew me because in twenty years’ traveling every driver, every conductor, every stationmaster ... The conductor would say, “When will you stop being mischievous? That poor fellow is going mad and I knew from the very beginning that this was going to happen.”\nOne night I was leaving Bombay. Nearabout fifty friends had come to see me off. In one compartment there was a Mohammedan, and in another compartment – because in Indian trains there is only one long car which is air-conditioned, divided into small cabins – in another cabin, there was a brahmin. You can tell these people by their appearance. The brahmin was declaring it on his forehead, the Mohammedan with his cap.\nThe conductor asked me, “With whom would you like to travel? One is Mohammedan, one is a brahmin. Other compartments are full.”\nI said, “The brahmin will be more hilarious.”\nHe said, “You never get tired of traveling and I know now that this brahmin is going to be in trouble.” And as I went in, the brahmin, just as the brahmins do, lay down on the floor and touched my feet, thinking that I am a great mahatma because fifty people had come to send me off and they had touched my feet and garlanded me.\nI said, “What are you doing? I am a Mohammedan.” And he stood up and he said, “If you are a Mohammedan, then why did you not say so before? You have spoiled my whole night. Now I have to take a bath in the cold night. Don’t you consider ...?”\nI said, “What can I do? I entered, I had not even a chance to say a word and you touched my feet. Obviously, you have to take a bath.”\nSo he went to take a bath in the cold night, but when he came back he said, “Are you really a Mohammedan?”\nI said, “I was just joking.”\n“What do you mean, joking? And the water ... it was ice cold.” I said, “I thought you would understand the joke.”\nHe said, “This is not right. I was certain that you are not a Mohammedan. But when you said you were, there was no question of not believing it.” He touched my feet again and said, “Forgive me.”\nI said, “You will have to take another bath.” He said, “What? What happened?”\nI said, “Really, I am a Mohammedan. Can’t you see my beard?” He looked at me and he thought about again having a bath. He called the conductor immediately and he said, “Can you find a place somewhere else?”\nThe conductor said, “What is wrong? Are you in some trouble?” He said, “Some trouble? I have to twice take cold baths in the middle of the night. And now I cannot sleep because I cannot convince myself that this fellow is Mohammedan. He is not.”\nThe conductor said, “As far as I know, he is not.”\nHe said, “You are a very good man; you saved me ... but he was torturing me.” I said, “I was simply testing whether you are a real brahmin or not.”\nHe said, “That is the way of the great saints.” He touched my feet again.\nAnd the conductor said, “What are you doing?” – because he knew me – “he is a Mohammedan. And a brahmin touching the feet of a Mohammedan? You will go direct to hell.”\nHe said, “Rather than going to hell, I will go direct to the bathroom again.” But this is the world – unconscious people.\nJoshu’s statement is that the inner eye is THE BUDDHA EYE, THE EYE OF THE LAW ... the law according to which the whole universe runs.\nAND ONCE A MONK ASKED TENDO, “WHAT IS THE EYE THAT LACKS NOTHING IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO LIFE?”\nTENDO ANSWERED, “IT IS JUST LIKE BLINDNESS.”\nThe man who has known himself becomes almost blind to all distinctions, discriminations, divisions, dualities. He becomes almost blind to all the things that you see and live and behave according to. But his blindness is far more important than your eyes. To be a buddha and blind is far more significant than to have eyes and not to be aware of oneself.\nFor centuries, there has been a discussion about whether the eyes should be open or closed on a statue of Buddha. The discussion became so hot that finally they decided, “Let his eyes be half open and half closed.” Everybody was satisfied.\nI was in a Buddhist temple, having a meditation camp there, exactly where Gautam Buddha became enlightened in Bodhgaya. I said to the priest, “This is not possible. Buddha must have been blinking his eyes. He cannot keep them always half open and half closed. It is possible to keep them closed, but it is not possible to keep them half open or half closed.”\nThe priest said, “Nobody has ever asked about it. And for centuries we have decided, because of conflicting groups ...”\nAnother sect, born side by side with Buddhism, is Jainism. There is the same problem, whether Mahavira’s eyes should be closed or open. On this stupid question, Jainas have become divided into two sects: one that keeps Mahavira’s eyes open, one that keeps Mahavira’s eyes closed.\nAt a Jaina conference I said to them, “Now electricity is available. You can make the eyes blink. That will be truer to life.”\nAnd they said, “You are joking about Mahavira too!”\nI said, “I am simply suggesting an idea to keep closer to reality. Mahavira was not blind, nor could he have managed to keep his eyes open completely, twenty-four hours. Up to now it was okay that you managed to divide into two sects, but now there is no need. Just connect the statue with electricity and Mahavira will go on blinking, twenty-four hours a day; and that will be joyous also, to look at Mahavira blinking. And sometimes to make it hilarious, you can make one eye blink.”\nReligion should be a joy. It is stupid, making Mahavira blind. And the other party is doing the other stupidity, keeping his eyes open continuously.\nThe problem is with our unconsciousness; we decide things and we also decide things about the people who are enlightened, but we don’t have any right to. We are going to make mistakes in making any judgment about the enlightened ones, because we cannot see that far, that deep, that high; we are creeping on the earth, we cannot see the eagle far away in the sky.\nThe people who have lived inwards have entered into a different world, to which you are blind. And naturally they have become blind to you, because they don’t see your world as being any longer significant. They have found a more authentic life, a more beautiful existence.\nThis inner clarity, this seeing into oneself, is called the third eye, or the Buddha Eye. When you look inwards in your meditations, remember just one thing: your interiority. Forget everything else as if it was all dream, and you have entered into a different area of existence where dreams cannot follow you.\nA Zen poem:\nTHE WIND DROPS\nBUT THE FLOWERS STILL FALL; A BIRD SINGS\nAND THE MOUNTAIN HOLDS YET MORE MYSTERY.\nIt is not that a man of inwardness becomes blind to the beauty of a bird on the wing, or the mystery of the mountains, or the flowers falling; he simply becomes blind to all that is nonsensical in our minds. He becomes blind to our jealousies; he does not know what it is, he has forgotten that language. He does not know what greed is, he has forgotten that language. He has forgotten your ordinary mind completely. He has entered into no-mind, into universal mind. There, another law – more fundamental than any law that we have created in our courts – prevails.\nBasho has written this:\nTHE CHESTNUT BY THE EAVES IN MAGNIFICENT BLOOM PASSES UNNOTICED\nBY MEN OF THIS WORLD.\nYou think you have eyes, but you may not have looked even at your wife accurately. You may have lived with her and you may never have looked into her eyes. People live together but remain strangers, keeping a little distance always, fearful of being dominated by the other.\nThe flowers and the stars ... they come every day, every night, but how many people see the sunset and the immense beauty and color that the sunset spreads on the horizon?\nThe roses may be blossoming in your own garden, but you don’t have time. You are reading a third- rate yellow newspaper, you are reading about politicians and all the nonsense that they go on doing to humanity. But you will not look, you don’t have time. You will not look at the night when all the stars arrive, your vision is very small.\nThe man of the inner eye not only becomes aware of the inner mysteries, he also becomes aware of the mysteries that are just around him everywhere. A buddha, one who is awakened, is awakened to truth, to beauty, to goodness.\nHis riches are great. Nan-O-Myo has written:\nNOT FALLING, NOT IGNORING – A PAIR OF MANDARIN DUCKS\nALIGHTING, BOBBING, ANYWHERE.\nZen is in its very essence a great poetic, aesthetic sensibility. It gives you more aliveness, it gives you and your senses their maximum. A man of Zen lives at the optimum – one cannot live more than he lives. Each breath is total in itself and each moment is so full of blessings, of ecstasies, of a great love, not directed to anybody but simply spread like the fragrance of flowers. Whoever is ready to receive it can have it. But whoever wants to grab onto it will lose it.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha’s question is:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIS THE MEDITATOR’S VIEW, THE BIRD’S-EYE VIEW?\nIt is much more, Maneesha. It is certainly a bird’s-eye view, but it is much more. The bird can see; his vision is far bigger than yours because he is at a higher altitude. But the man of awareness is not only at a higher altitude, he is also at a deeper interiority. A bird cannot become a buddha. It is man’s right, only man’s right, to become a buddha.\nMan is evolution’s highest peak, but don’t stop at it. One step more and you will have stepped on the Everest of being.\nBefore we go deeper into ourselves – a few intimate laughs, just to clean the air and to make you more light, weightless, less serious.\nA Russian, a Cuban, a Catholic priest and Swami Deva Coconut are on a train traveling across Europe. The Russian takes out a large bottle of vodka. He pours each of his companions a drink, and then throws the half-full bottle out of the window. “Why did you do that?” asks Swami Coconut.\n“There is so much vodka in my country,” replies the Russian. “We have more than we can ever use.”\nA little later, the Cuban passes around a box of Cuban cigars. Everyone takes one, then he throws the rest of the box out of the window.\n“My god!” says Coconut. “Why did you do that?”\n“Cigars,” replies the Cuban, “are a dime a dozen in my country. We have more of them than we know what to do with!”\nCoconut sits in silence for a moment. Then he gets up, grabs the Catholic priest and throws him out of the window.\nLittle Melvin, little Billy and little Dings-bums are bored, sitting around together outside the drugstore. Suddenly, little Melvin finds a twenty-dollar bill on the ground and says, “Hey, look! Let’s go in and change it and then each of us can buy something really far out!”\nThey go in and change the money, divide it up and disappear into the store to spend it. Half an hour later, they meet again outside.\n“What did you get?” Melvin asks Billy.\n“I got this super basketball, so we can all play basketball like those guys on TV,” says Billy. “What did you get?”\n“Wow, man,” says Melvin, “just like I saw on the TV, I got this skateboard so we can skate all over the place.”\nThen they turn to Dings-bums. “What did you get?”\nDings-bums pulls out a box from his bag and says, “A box of tampons.”\nMelvin and Billy look puzzled. Finally, little Melvin asks, “What the hell did you get that for?”\n“Well,” says Dings-bums, “they say on television, that with these tampons you can do all kinds of things – like running, horse-riding, and swimming!”\nNow, Nivedano, everybody goes absolutely crazy ... (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes, no movement of the body. Forget the world outside. Just be in.\nDeeper and deeper, deeper like an arrow. This beautiful silence, and your being IN ... To make it deeper, Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, let go. Just be dead. The body is far away ...\nSo is the mind. You are just the inner flame at the deepest core of your being. This is the only thing in you that is eternal, that knows no death, no change. In this great moment you are all buddhas.\nRemember it twenty-four hours, that inside you, the buddha is sitting. You are just a temple.\nInside the temple is this flame of light.\nTo continue to remember it ... your every act will become graceful, your every word will carry silence. Your very being will spread joy.\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat) Come back.\nRemembering the buddha, sit for a moment .… Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nCan we celebrate?\nYes!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7574","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_solitary_bird_cuckoo_of_the_forest/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zen_the_solitary_bird_cuckoo_of_the_forest/>Zen.

HE KNOWS THIS IS TOM, THIS IS DICK, OR THIS IS HARRY. THERE IS A MAN
PASSING BEFORE THE BUDDHA HALL. SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE SEES NOTHING AND
NOBODY. TELL ME, WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM?”</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK SAID, “BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES THINGS BADLY, IT MEANS HE
CAN’T SEE.” HOFUKU SAID, “KWATZ!” THEN HE SAID, “IF THIS IS THE BUDDHA

HE MAY BE SAID NOT YET TO HAVE THE SPIRITUAL EYE, THE PHYSICAL EYE MAY

SLEEPS.”</p><p><br></p><p>AND ONCE A MONK ASKED TENDO, “WHAT IS THE EYE THAT LACKS NOTHING IN
ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO LIFE?”</p><p><br></p><p>TENDO ANSWERED, “IT IS JUST LIKE BLINDNESS.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, before I answer and discuss the profound sutra you have
placed before me, I have to deal with something urgent, but
non-essential. Tomorrow will be too late, so I have to deal with it
today.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to think that idiots don’t grow, they always remain idiots.
Today I found that they do grow – they become more idiotic. The whole
credit goes to that old goat of Puri, the Shankaracharya. For almost two
weeks he had been insisting that no untouchable, no sudra can enter into
the temple of Nath Dwara. It will destroy the purity of thousands of
years; no sudra has ever entered it.</p><p><br></p><p>He has even challenged me to a discussion on the point; and he has
asserted in a press conference that he is ready to be arrested, but he
won’t allow any untouchable to enter the temple of Nath Dwara. But in
these ten days, from every nook and corner of the country, he has been
bombarded. He was hoping at least that the orthodox will support him,
but they have remained silent.</p><p><br></p><p>No intelligent man can support him. Seeing that the situation is
getting out of hand, today he has made a statement, that “I have been
misrepresented.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of newspapers in all the thirty languages of this country
for ten days continuously have been misrepresenting him and he has been
silent. Now he has come with a new statement and the statement is, “I
never said that harijans, the untouchables, cannot enter Nath Dwara. I
said they do not need to enter Nath Dwara; they are God’s people” – the
word ‘harijan’ means God’s people – “and they don’t have to go to any
temple, God will come to them himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place no Hindu scripture calls them harijans, they are
called sudras, untouchables. The word ‘harijan’ was invented by Mahatma
Gandhi for his own politics. Sometimes just by changing a name a great
consolation comes. He started calling the sudras God’s own people, but
nothing changed. And it is very strange that God’s own people should
always suffer and the others, who are not God’s own people, should enjoy
richness, respectability and all the advantages that are available.</p><p><br></p><p>But harijans were happy to lose their name ‘untouchable’. It means
that they are so dirty that they cannot even be touched, not even their
shadow can be touched. If you touch their shadow, you will</p><p>have to go through a purification process, you will have to call
brahmins, you will have to take a bath in the Ganges, you will have to
be surrounded by priests chanting mantras, and only then will you be
back again to your own caste; otherwise you have fallen, you have
touched the shadow of a sudra.</p><p><br></p><p>But with the changing of their name to harijans, God’s own people,
sudras felt very good, very consoled. This is how the politicians and
the priests work. In reality nothing changes, just the label. But now it
makes them feel that they ARE God’s own people.</p><p><br></p><p>This Shankaracharya of Puri is saying something which is even more
stupid than his earlier statement that he will prevent harijans from
entering Nath Dwara. Now he is saying, “They are God’s own people, God
will come to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I want to ask him – what about others? What about himself? Why are
others going to the temples? Nobody should go. At least the temple of
Puri should be closed to the Shankaracharya. If God is going to come to
people of his own choice, then the brahmins – who have been the people
of his choice for thousands of years – should not go to the temples. In
fact nobody should go. I agree perfectly, there is no need. These
temples should be changed into schools, into hospitals, into anything
utilitarian. They have accumulated most of the money of the country, and
it should be used for schools and colleges.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he will be in more difficulty. If God comes to meet his own
people, the Shankaracharya has saved himself from his previous statement
but he has put himself into a more difficult and complex position. Now
all the Hindus other than sudras should ask him, “What about us? Is God
going to meet us outside of the temple or in the temple? If he meets the
harijans – who have been for thousands of years condemned – outside of
the temple, then why should we go to the temple?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then in fact the very necessity for temples is no longer there. God
has to be met outside under the trees, under the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now the Shankaracharya was against harijans, and he is still
against them. He thinks he is being a great politician by saying that
they need not go to the temples. But I want to create more difficulty
for him. All the remaining Hindus should ask him, “What about us – you
are putting us lower than the sudras. What about yourself? Why do you go
to the temple? And what is the need of all your scriptures?”</p><p><br></p><p>Just meet God outside in the open air, by the sea, by the side of the
river, anywhere. Wherever you remember him, he will be there. If he can
come to meet the untouchables ... you are touchables, he can even touch
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this I have had to change my standpoint. I used to think
that retarded people never grow. They grow. They become more retarded!
The Shankaracharya is a living example. Now he has to tell the whole
country what the status is of temples and scriptures and what need there
is of worship, yagnas, statues, and what need there is of caste. If
sudras are people of God, then others also are people of God; or do you
want to say that only harijans are people of God and others are not even
cousin-brothers to harijans?</p><p><br></p><p>This fellow should be put right. He is getting more and more senile,
he needs to be hospitalized. And if nobody allows him, I am ready to
allow him here and we will give him a good round of therapies</p><p>and cleanse him of all this nonsense that he has been carrying. There
is no need for him to be arrested and become a martyr, he is simply
sick!</p><p><br></p><p>But he will not realize it. He will have to be forced to realize that
he is suffering from psychological illness. He should renounce the post
of Shankaracharya and just get entered into a madhouse, where he will
find very similar souls, speaking the same language – which nobody
understands.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends, Narendra’s father, had a strange illness. Six
months of the year he used to be mad and the remaining six months he was
absolutely sane. Whenever he was sane he was ill, with always this
problem and that problem and a headache and a stomachache, and he looked
very sad. But whenever he became mad he was perfectly healthy, no sign
of any sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>Once when he was perfectly mad and healthy he escaped from the house.
He was caught by the police in Agra, where the Taj Mahal is, because of
a very strange linguistic problem. He entered a sweet shop. There is a
sweet which is called khaja. But ‘khaja’ also means, ‘eat it’. He asked
the shopkeeper what it was, and the shopkeeper said “khaja” so he
started eating it.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Are you mad?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You must be mad, you told me ‘khaja’.”</p><p><br></p><p>A crowd gathered and the police came and he was brought to the
magistrate and the magistrate was also at a loss, because the poor
fellow was not wrong – why did they make such names for sweets? He was
simply following what the shopkeeper said.</p><p><br></p><p>But by asking other questions he figured out that he was mad. He was
sentenced to the madhouse for six months. But they did not know his
psychological history, that three months of his madness were over and
after three months he would become sane on his own. There was no
problem, it was simply a swing from madness to sanity, from sanity to
madness. His whole life he had been on the swing.</p><p><br></p><p>So in the madhouse the first three months were perfect. He enjoyed
himself with all the mad people, he loved the place. But in his madness
he drank something that was brought to clean the toilets. He drank the
whole bottle. He suffered for days from diarrhea and vomiting. But
because of this diarrhea and vomiting, within fifteen days he became
sane. All heat went out of him; he became completely calm and quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he became afraid, surrounded by all the mad people –
somebody was pulling his hair, somebody was trying to put a finger into
his ear, somebody was sitting on his shoulders. It had all been good up
to that point, but now he tried hard to convince the superintendent
that, “I am no longer mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>The superintendent said, “Don’t bother me, every madman says that.
That is no argument! You will have to remain here until you fulfill your
sentence of six months.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “In three months these mad people and you will kill me! It
was good before, immensely good, I was enjoying it. Why did you bring
this bottle here?”</p><p>But he had to suffer, law is law. When he came out I asked him,
“Uncle, how have things been?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very friendly to everybody, and except for his family
everybody enjoyed him. The family was suffering, because he was stealing
things and distributing them to the beggars, borrowing money from
anywhere and the family had to pay it, purchasing anything that he
wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a great shopper, all kinds of junk, it did not matter what it
was. Just if it was cheap, he would purchase it.</p><p><br></p><p>So the family was in difficulty. I remember Narendra was so small,
but these small children used to watch him and shout to their mother,
“He is trying to take something away, he is trying to open the locker.”
Everybody was on watch.</p><p><br></p><p>He said to me, “Everything was so good for three months. I enjoyed
it, I had found my people. But when I became sane, I found that these
were not my people.”</p><p><br></p><p>I hope that the Shankaracharya of Puri, in any madhouse, will find
his friends with similar ideas. He will enjoy it. It is not going to be
a suffering or a punishment, it will be a promotion. And to leave him
out in this insane condition is harmful to society. For the sake of
society he should be forced into a psychiatric clinic.</p><p><br></p><p>I never thought that after ten days he would start lying. Now he says
he never made any such statements and thousands of newspapers all over
India have been misrepresenting him. If one paper had done it one could
believe it, but these thousands of papers cannot be in a conspiracy. And
they are all owned by high-caste Hindus – they were ashamed that he was
making such statements.</p><p><br></p><p>The untouchables have been kept out of the temples; there is no need
to make statements, no need to make any fuss about it. In fact they
themselves don’t go. Other politicians are trying to persuade them to
enter into the temples, but they know that they will be beaten, they
know that their houses will be burned, they know that their women will
be raped. They know perfectly well that the police will stand there in
favor of the richer high-class Hindus, and nobody is going to protect
them. But politicians use human beings just like things,
commodities.</p><p><br></p><p>The politicians who are trying to get them to enter the temple, their
whole object is to have their vote, temple or no temple. They want the
harijans to be rejected from the temple so that they can sympathize with
them, “We have made every effort for you, we risked our lives; now at
least give us your votes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the Shankaracharya was defending the higher class Hindus, who are
three times more numerous than the sudras. His interest is also in
votes. Just two days ago he said, “Perhaps I will have to enter into
politics.” It is better that he enters. At least this mask of a
religious saint will drop and he will be just an ordinary gutter
politician. It will be a great day of celebration – at least we will
celebrate. He should drop his Shankaracharyahood and run for election.
But he should not lie to people or make such stupid statements.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is as divine as everybody else. There cannot be any
distinction. Anybody who makes a distinction is the enemy of the
people.</p><p>Maneesha has brought a beautiful, very significant dialogue:</p><p><br></p><p>HOFUKU SAID, “THERE IS A MAN NOW PASSING BEHIND THE BUDDHA HALL, AND
HE KNOWS THIS IS TOM, THIS IS DICK, OR THIS IS HARRY.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strangely enough, when I entered I found three women, not three men,
just walking behind the Buddha Hall. But times have changed. And it does
not matter who was walking, the question can still be asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“AND THERE IS A MAN PASSING BEFORE THE BUDDHA HALL. SOMEHOW OR OTHER
HE SEES NOTHING AND NOBODY. TELL ME, WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF
BUDDHISM?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is asking, in other words, to make it simple: “These persons I see
behind the Buddha Hall, the person I see in front – they seem to be
almost frozen statues. They must be in meditation. They don’t see
anything, they don’t bother about anything.” This man Hofuku, the master
of the temple, is asking, “WHERE IS THE PROFIT AND LOSS OF BUDDHISM if
people become so careless that you pass in front of them and they don’t
even look at you – as if nobody has passed? They are so self-centered
that the whole world outside has disappeared. Then what is the point of
Buddhism? Is this a loss or a profit?”</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK SAID, “BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES THINGS BADLY, IT MEANS HE
CAN’T SEE.”</p><p><br></p><p>HOFUKU SAID, “KWATZ!” to the monk who was giving this answer –
because he divides things into good and bad, into black and white, into
dead and alive. He cannot see what those persons are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Hofuku shouted the Zen KWATZ! which is equivalent to the stick
hitting your head. Because the master cannot always carry the stick,
they found an equivalent. And certainly when a Zen monk or master shouts
“Kwatz!” it hits harder than any stick can. It keeps you utterly silent
– “What happened? Why has he started shouting in a strange way, a sound
which means nothing?” But it can wake you. Any sound, meaningless or
meaningful, can wake you up.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen experience is that certain sounds reach into certain centers
of your being. That is the experience of all the mystics of the world.
For example, Sufis have found the sound HOO. If you repeat “Hoo”
continuously, you will find that the center of your life, just two
inches below your navel, is hit again and again. Soon there will be
sparks coming out of your life center.</p><p><br></p><p>In this country, they have found OM – which is mild, in accordance
with the character of the people who have lived in this country. It does
not hit very hard, but it pushes. “Om, Om,” again and again – it pushes
you into a different space that is not mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has found KWATZ – it is like their character, their training,
their samuraihood. They are warriors. “Kwatz!” – it hits exactly the
same center as “Hoo.” When you greet each other with “Yaa-Hoo,” you are
hitting the same center.</p><p><br></p><p>HOFUKU SAID, “IF THIS IS THE BUDDHA HALL, HE CAN’T SEE.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “IF IT WASN’T THE BUDDHA HALL, HE COULD SEE ALL
RIGHT!”</p><p>HOFUKU SAID, “IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE
ANYTHING.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now in the language of Zen, anything and nothing are equivalent. To
see nothing is to see all because nothing is the very source of all. The
question is about the Buddha Hall. The monk is saying that if these
people were not in the Buddha Hall, they could see everything. You all
see everything outside the Buddha Hall, but in the Buddha Hall, you stop
seeing all kinds of stupid things. You become almost blind to the world.
Your eyes turn inwards. You start seeing only your own being as if
nothing else exists.</p><p><br></p><p>HOFUKU SAID, “IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUDDHA HALL THAT HE CAN SEE
ANYTHING.”</p><p><br></p><p>A very illogical dialogue, but if you understand, I have made it
absolutely logical. Sitting like a buddha, you stop seeing the whole
world because you start seeing your inner being. And running around
seeing things, you forget all about yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO BOKUSHU, “I BEG YOU TO EXPOUND TO
ME THE GREAT MEANING OF BUDDHISM.”</p><p><br></p><p>BOKUSHU SAID, “YOU BRING IT TO ME, AND I’LL EXPOUND IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>These were great masters. You cannot drag them into intellectual
thinking; you cannot drag them down from their hilltops, from their
watching silence. He says, “You bring it to me. You want to understand
Buddhism? Just bring it here.” Now, nobody can bring Buddhism, it is not
a thing. “Bring it to me and I will expound it. And if you cannot bring
it, I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “Please, don’t ask such an impossible thing. Just tell
me the meaning of Buddhism.”</p><p><br></p><p>BOKUSHU SAID, “WHEN WE BREAK THE EASTERN HEDGE, WE MUST MEND THE
WESTERN FENCE.”</p><p><br></p><p>By saying this, he is saying, “A dialogue between me and you is
almost impossible. It is like a man whose eastern hedge is broken and he
starts mending the western fence. He is an idiot. You are doing the
same. The only way I can expound Buddhism is if you bring it to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>How can one bring Buddhism? If one comes in silence and stillness and
sits by the side of the master without even asking, just waiting in deep
trust and love, the very presence of the master will become a great
sermon.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not a theorization, it is not some philosophy. It is a very
real experience, almost tangible, but you have to understand its way. If
you are open, silent, the master will pour all that he has. But in words
you can get lost, you will not understand the essence of being a
buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way is to be.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED JOSHU, “WHAT IS THIS EYE OF THE ONE WHO NEVER
SLEEPS?”</p><p><br></p><p>It reminds me of a night twenty-five centuries ago .…</p><p>When Gautam Buddha was alive, he used to always sleep in the same
posture; and the whole night, he would not move from side to side, he
would not change his posture, not even an inch. Just nearby, in the
Ajanta caves, in the last cave there is a sculpture of Gautam Buddha
sleeping. That pose has become known as the ‘Lion’s pose’ because the
lion also sleeps on its side without moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda was very much troubled because every night he could see –
sometimes in the middle of the night he would wake up – that Buddha was
absolutely still, just as he had always been. One night, he could not
resist the temptation.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is not good to disturb you in the night, because the
whole day you have been walking and teaching, but I cannot resist. For
twenty years I have been watching. You can understand how long I have
waited, but now I have to ask it anyway. How do you manage to remain in
the same posture that you go to sleep in, the same posture for the whole
night? Do you sleep or do you simply go on keeping the posture? –
because I have to move continuously.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha said, “I have found the right posture. Now there is no
need to change it. And I am as awake as anyone, even while my body is
asleep. I have found the right posture for the body ... you are still
searching for it. It is not simply a question of tossing and turning the
body, it is because your mind is tossing and turning. I have gone beyond
– there is no mind. The body simply lies down like a corpse. Have you
ever seen any corpse changing its posture?”</p><p><br></p><p>In one story a woman reached to the Pearly Gates. And as Saint Peter
opened the door, she asked immediately about her husband, “Where is
Tom?”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter said, “Dear lady, there must be millions of Toms. You
will have to describe him to me in detail. Just tell me something about
which Tom, and I will try my best to find him.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “I don’t know how to describe him. Only one thing I
remember is that when he died, before dying he said, ‘Remember not to be
unfaithful to me because if you are, I will toss and turn in my
grave.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter said, “Aha, don’t be worried. He is a well-known figure
here. We call him Whirling Tom. I will find him for you. Somewhere he
must be whirling.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is your mind. Once your mind is at rest, once it disappears, your
body can remain asleep but your inner eye, your inner sensitivity, your
awareness, can remain burning like a small flame – not only watching
your body, but also watching the silent mind, and the stillness
surrounding you. The enlightened man cannot sleep in the same way that
the unenlightened one sleeps. When the unenlightened man sleeps, he is
simply unconscious. The enlightened man sleeps but he is not
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU SAID, “THE PHYSICAL EYE OF THE ORDINARY MAN.” HE ADDED, “THOUGH
HE MAY BE SAID NOT YET TO HAVE THE SPIRITUAL EYE, THE PHYSICAL EYE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SAME THING.”</p><p><br></p><p>The question is that if your mind is silent then even your physical
eyes stop moving. You can try it as an experiment. This is the way that
psychoanalysts find out whether a sleeping person is</p><p>dreaming or not. And now, there is much research going on about
dreams and dreamless sleep. It has completely overturned the ancient
idea. The old idea was that there are a few dreams once in a while,
mostly early in the morning when you are going to wake up; otherwise,
you sleep soundly.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern research says that you dream six hours out of eight. If you
sleep eight hours, then for six hours you dream. Those two hours of
dreamless sleep are also not solid, but broken here and there – ten
minutes here, fifteen minutes there. But this proportion had never been
mentioned anywhere in the world before.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second revolutionary discovery which has come out of it is
that when you are watching somebody sleeping, you can know the type of
sleep just by looking at his eyes. They are closed, but if he is
dreaming, then you can see that under the eyelids, the eyes are moving.
That movement is absolutely clear. It is just like when you read, you
have to move your eyes; when you see a film, you have to move your eyes.
Dreaming is a kind of film running on the screen of your mind, and the
eyes have to move with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The traditional wisdom was that if you don’t dream very much, it is a
sign of health. The modern researchers have found just the opposite – of
course this research is done with ordinary people, not those who are
meditating, otherwise the results would be different. They have found
that dreaming is a way of throwing away all the dust that people have
gathered during the day. If they don’t dream they will go mad, because
every day the dust will go on collecting. Soon they will be surrounded
by dust, thick layers of thought, incomplete experiences, all kinds of
junk, and they will not be able to find the way out and come back home.
Every day, just as you take a bath or clean your teeth, your mind
automatically tries to throw away all kinds of dust that has gathered
during the day. This needs six hours, so the healthy man dreams six
hours and sleeps two hours.</p><p><br></p><p>That brings many implications. The researchers have been
experimenting with a few people in one lab, and a few people in another
lab<span class=s4></span>In one lab they try to disturb the people
whenever they start</p><p>dreaming. Whenever they see that their eyes are moving, they wake
them up. In the other lab, they wake them up whenever their eyes are not
moving. In one lab they disturb their sleep, and in the other they
disturb their dreams. And the strange result is that the people whose
sleep is disturbed and whose dreams are allowed, wake up profoundly
refreshed without any trouble. And the people whose dreams are disturbed
and whose sleep is allowed, wake up utterly tired, tattered. It seems
that dreams are more significant than sleep. But this research is only
confined to non-meditators.</p><p><br></p><p>A meditator throws away all the dust himself, he does not wait for
the biological sleep to throw it away. He throws it away consciously and
with full awareness. Then his sleep becomes a deep silence and also a
deep awareness. This awareness has been called the third eye, but the
third eye is only a symbol.</p><p><br></p><p>What we are doing here every day in meditation<span class=s4></span>within two minutes you are throwing away almost</p><p>six hours’ load. It is a question of totality. Don’t hold back, don’t
think of what people will think about you. Here, there is nobody even
listening to you. Everybody is so much involved in himself and everybody
is competing with everybody else! This throwing away gibberish will
reduce your dreams, and if you were brought to be examined for your
sleep, the results would be different. Your dreams would be far less and
your sleep would be longer.</p><p>And a new factor will have arisen in you: a thin line of awareness,
which as you go on growing in meditation becomes bigger and bigger. A
point comes in that fire of your awareness where all your dreams burn,
and only sleep is left. The body sleeps, it is tired – it needs rest.
But your consciousness is never tired. It burns bright, day in, day
out.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE EYE OF THE ONE WHO SLEEPS?”</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU SAID, “THE BUDDHA EYE; THE EYE OF THE LAW IS THE EYE OF HIM WHO
SLEEPS.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, your sleep is as insane as your waking. Just consider for a
moment: is your waking sane? Are not insane thoughts moving inside you –
anger and greed and hate and possessiveness? And thousands are the names
of all the kinds of madnesses that are going on inside you, although you
are trying to hide them. You are wearing a mask; just as you are hiding
your body with clothes, you are hiding your mind with smiles, with
thoughts, talking with people. Your conversations are nothing but
distractions, distractions of your insane mind.</p><p><br></p><p>I traveled in this country for almost twenty years. And it was an
experience, because I traveled only in the air-conditioned coupe, so
once in a while there was another passenger but otherwise I was alone.
The other person would usually try to make some conversation immediately
... and I had a beautiful opportunity. I would tell him my name, my
father’s name, my father’s father’s name, how many brothers my father
has, how many children my uncles have. And he would be amazed because he
had simply asked me my name.</p><p><br></p><p>I would say, “You were going to ask all these things. I am settling
everything right now, so we can be silent. Twenty-four hours we are
going to be together ...”</p><p><br></p><p>The man would look at me a little strangely, but I would close my
eyes. Once in a while, I would open them and see what he was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>These travelings have been my labs with thousands of people. I have
not missed a single moment of watching and seeing what is happening. The
man will read the same newspaper again and again and will start getting
angry – angry at me, but he cannot say it, because I have told him,
“Don’t say a single word. All inquiry is finished. I have told you
everything about me; more than that, I don’t know either.”</p><p><br></p><p>He will open his suitcase and close his suitcase, open the window and
close the window. And I am watching. And in an air-conditioned
compartment, he will start perspiring, he will call the conductor, “Can
you change my place to some other compartment? Because I am going to go
mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “I don’t see what is bothering you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is the problem! Nobody is bothering me. This fellow is
simply sitting and looking at me as if I am an experimental zoo. And I
am behaving insanely, I know. But because of him I have to do something,
otherwise ... And he has closed the conversation from the very
beginning. No conversation! So I am reading the same newspaper and
getting angry. I open the suitcase and I know there is no need to open
it; I put my clothes this way and that way but what is the point? I go
unnecessarily to the bathroom and then I look stupid ... ‘This is
strange, you don’t have anything to do in the bathroom. Why are you
going?’”</p><p>Almost all the conductors knew me because in twenty years’ traveling
every driver, every conductor, every stationmaster ... The conductor
would say, “When will you stop being mischievous? That poor fellow is
going mad and I knew from the very beginning that this was going to
happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>One night I was leaving Bombay. Nearabout fifty friends had come to
see me off. In one compartment there was a Mohammedan, and in another
compartment – because in Indian trains there is only one long car which
is air-conditioned, divided into small cabins – in another cabin, there
was a brahmin. You can tell these people by their appearance. The
brahmin was declaring it on his forehead, the Mohammedan with his
cap.</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor asked me, “With whom would you like to travel? One is
Mohammedan, one is a brahmin. Other compartments are full.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The brahmin will be more hilarious.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You never get tired of traveling and I know now that this
brahmin is going to be in trouble.” And as I went in, the brahmin, just
as the brahmins do, lay down on the floor and touched my feet, thinking
that I am a great mahatma because fifty people had come to send me off
and they had touched my feet and garlanded me.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What are you doing? I am a Mohammedan.” And he stood up and
he said, “If you are a Mohammedan, then why did you not say so before?
You have spoiled my whole night. Now I have to take a bath in the cold
night. Don’t you consider ...?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What can I do? I entered, I had not even a chance to say a
word and you touched my feet. Obviously, you have to take a bath.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went to take a bath in the cold night, but when he came back he
said, “Are you really a Mohammedan?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I was just joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean, joking? And the water ... it was ice cold.” I
said, “I thought you would understand the joke.”</p><p>He said, “This is not right. I was certain that you are not a
Mohammedan. But when you said you were, there was no question of not
believing it.” He touched my feet again and said, “Forgive me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You will have to take another bath.” He said, “What? What
happened?”</p><p>I said, “Really, I am a Mohammedan. Can’t you see my beard?” He
looked at me and he thought about again having a bath. He called the
conductor immediately and he said, “Can you find a place somewhere
else?”</p><p>The conductor said, “What is wrong? Are you in some trouble?” He
said, “Some trouble? I have to twice take cold baths in the middle of
the night. And now I cannot sleep because I cannot convince myself that
this fellow is Mohammedan. He is not.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “As far as I know, he is not.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are a very good man; you saved me ... but he was
torturing me.” I said, “I was simply testing whether you are a real
brahmin or not.”</p><p>He said, “That is the way of the great saints.” He touched my feet
again.</p><p><br></p><p>And the conductor said, “What are you doing?” – because he knew me –
“he is a Mohammedan. And a brahmin touching the feet of a Mohammedan?
You will go direct to hell.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Rather than going to hell, I will go direct to the bathroom
again.” But this is the world – unconscious people.</p><p>Joshu’s statement is that the inner eye is THE BUDDHA EYE, THE EYE OF
THE LAW ... the law according to which the whole universe runs.</p><p><br></p><p>AND ONCE A MONK ASKED TENDO, “WHAT IS THE EYE THAT LACKS NOTHING IN
ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO LIFE?”</p><p><br></p><p>TENDO ANSWERED, “IT IS JUST LIKE BLINDNESS.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man who has known himself becomes almost blind to all
distinctions, discriminations, divisions, dualities. He becomes almost
blind to all the things that you see and live and behave according to.
But his blindness is far more important than your eyes. To be a buddha
and blind is far more significant than to have eyes and not to be aware
of oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>For centuries, there has been a discussion about whether the eyes
should be open or closed on a statue of Buddha. The discussion became so
hot that finally they decided, “Let his eyes be half open and half
closed.” Everybody was satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in a Buddhist temple, having a meditation camp there, exactly
where Gautam Buddha became enlightened in Bodhgaya. I said to the
priest, “This is not possible. Buddha must have been blinking his eyes.
He cannot keep them always half open and half closed. It is possible to
keep them closed, but it is not possible to keep them half open or half
closed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “Nobody has ever asked about it. And for centuries
we have decided, because of conflicting groups ...”</p><p><br></p><p>Another sect, born side by side with Buddhism, is Jainism. There is
the same problem, whether Mahavira’s eyes should be closed or open. On
this stupid question, Jainas have become divided into two sects: one
that keeps Mahavira’s eyes open, one that keeps Mahavira’s eyes
closed.</p><p>At a Jaina conference I said to them, “Now electricity is available.
You can make the eyes blink. That will be truer to life.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they said, “You are joking about Mahavira too!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am simply suggesting an idea to keep closer to reality.
Mahavira was not blind, nor could he have managed to keep his eyes open
completely, twenty-four hours. Up to now it was okay that you managed to
divide into two sects, but now there is no need. Just connect the statue
with electricity and Mahavira will go on blinking, twenty-four hours a
day; and that will be joyous also, to look at Mahavira blinking. And
sometimes to make it hilarious, you can make one eye blink.”</p><p><br></p><p>Religion should be a joy. It is stupid, making Mahavira blind. And
the other party is doing the other stupidity, keeping his eyes open
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is with our unconsciousness; we decide things and we also
decide things about the people who are enlightened, but we don’t have
any right to. We are going to make mistakes in making any judgment about
the enlightened ones, because we cannot see that far, that deep, that
high; we are creeping on the earth, we cannot see the eagle far away in
the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who have lived inwards have entered into a different
world, to which you are blind. And naturally they have become blind to
you, because they don’t see your world as being any longer significant.
They have found a more authentic life, a more beautiful existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This inner clarity, this seeing into oneself, is called the third
eye, or the Buddha Eye. When you look inwards in your meditations,
remember just one thing: your interiority. Forget everything else as if
it was all dream, and you have entered into a different area of
existence where dreams cannot follow you.</p><p><br></p><p>A Zen poem:</p><p><br></p><p>THE WIND DROPS</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THE FLOWERS STILL FALL; A BIRD SINGS</p><p>AND THE MOUNTAIN HOLDS YET MORE MYSTERY.</p><p>It is not that a man of inwardness becomes blind to the beauty of a
bird on the wing, or the mystery of the mountains, or the flowers
falling; he simply becomes blind to all that is nonsensical in our
minds. He becomes blind to our jealousies; he does not know what it is,
he has forgotten that language. He does not know what greed is, he has
forgotten that language. He has forgotten your ordinary mind completely.
He has entered into no-mind, into universal mind. There, another law –
more fundamental than any law that we have created in our courts –
prevails.</p><p><br></p><p>Basho has written this:</p><p>THE CHESTNUT BY THE EAVES IN MAGNIFICENT BLOOM PASSES UNNOTICED</p><p>BY MEN OF THIS WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>You think you have eyes, but you may not have looked even at your
wife accurately. You may have lived with her and you may never have
looked into her eyes. People live together but remain strangers, keeping
a little distance always, fearful of being dominated by the other.</p><p><br></p><p>The flowers and the stars ... they come every day, every night, but
how many people see the sunset and the immense beauty and color that the
sunset spreads on the horizon?</p><p><br></p><p>The roses may be blossoming in your own garden, but you don’t have
time. You are reading a third- rate yellow newspaper, you are reading
about politicians and all the nonsense that they go on doing to
humanity. But you will not look, you don’t have time. You will not look
at the night when all the stars arrive, your vision is very small.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of the inner eye not only becomes aware of the inner
mysteries, he also becomes aware of the mysteries that are just around
him everywhere. A buddha, one who is awakened, is awakened to truth, to
beauty, to goodness.</p><p><br></p><p>His riches are great. Nan-O-Myo has written:</p><p>NOT FALLING, NOT IGNORING – A PAIR OF MANDARIN DUCKS</p><p>ALIGHTING, BOBBING, ANYWHERE.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is in its very essence a great poetic, aesthetic sensibility. It
gives you more aliveness, it gives you and your senses their maximum. A
man of Zen lives at the optimum – one cannot live more than he lives.
Each breath is total in itself and each moment is so full of blessings,
of ecstasies, of a great love, not directed to anybody but simply spread
like the fragrance of flowers. Whoever is ready to receive it can have
it. But whoever wants to grab onto it will lose it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question is:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE MEDITATOR’S VIEW, THE BIRD’S-EYE VIEW?</p><p>It is much more, Maneesha. It is certainly a bird’s-eye view, but it
is much more. The bird can see; his vision is far bigger than yours
because he is at a higher altitude. But the man of awareness is not only
at a higher altitude, he is also at a deeper interiority. A bird cannot
become a buddha. It is man’s right, only man’s right, to become a
buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is evolution’s highest peak, but don’t stop at it. One step more
and you will have stepped on the Everest of being.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we go deeper into ourselves – a few intimate laughs, just to
clean the air and to make you more light, weightless, less serious.</p><p><br></p><p>A Russian, a Cuban, a Catholic priest and Swami Deva Coconut are on a
train traveling across Europe. The Russian takes out a large bottle of
vodka. He pours each of his companions a drink, and then throws the
half-full bottle out of the window. “Why did you do that?” asks Swami
Coconut.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is so much vodka in my country,” replies the Russian. “We have
more than we can ever use.”</p><p><br></p><p>A little later, the Cuban passes around a box of Cuban cigars.
Everyone takes one, then he throws the rest of the box out of the
window.</p><p><br></p><p>“My god!” says Coconut. “Why did you do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Cigars,” replies the Cuban, “are a dime a dozen in my country. We
have more of them than we know what to do with!”</p><p><br></p><p>Coconut sits in silence for a moment. Then he gets up, grabs the
Catholic priest and throws him out of the window.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Melvin, little Billy and little Dings-bums are bored, sitting
around together outside the drugstore. Suddenly, little Melvin finds a
twenty-dollar bill on the ground and says, “Hey, look! Let’s go in and
change it and then each of us can buy something really far out!”</p><p><br></p><p>They go in and change the money, divide it up and disappear into the
store to spend it. Half an hour later, they meet again outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you get?” Melvin asks Billy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I got this super basketball, so we can all play basketball like
those guys on TV,” says Billy. “What did you get?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, man,” says Melvin, “just like I saw on the TV, I got this
skateboard so we can skate all over the place.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then they turn to Dings-bums. “What did you get?”</p><p><br></p><p>Dings-bums pulls out a box from his bag and says, “A box of
tampons.”</p><p><br></p><p>Melvin and Billy look puzzled. Finally, little Melvin asks, “What the
hell did you get that for?”</p><p>“Well,” says Dings-bums, “they say on television, that with these
tampons you can do all kinds of things – like running, horse-riding, and
swimming!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Nivedano, everybody goes absolutely crazy ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish) (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes, no movement of the body. Forget the world
outside. Just be in.</p><p>Deeper and deeper, deeper like an arrow. This beautiful silence, and
your being IN ... To make it deeper, Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, let go. Just be dead. The body is far away ...</p><p>So is the mind. You are just the inner flame at the deepest core of
your being. This is the only thing in you that is eternal, that knows no
death, no change. In this great moment you are all buddhas.</p><p>Remember it twenty-four hours, that inside you, the buddha is
sitting. You are just a temple.</p><p>Inside the temple is this flame of light.</p><p><br></p><p>To continue to remember it ... your every act will become graceful,
your every word will carry silence. Your very being will spread joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) Come back.</p><p>Remembering the buddha, sit for a moment .… Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

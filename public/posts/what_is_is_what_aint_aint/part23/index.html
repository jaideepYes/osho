Deva means divine, anunada means vibration. You have to meditate much on vibrations and you have to learn how to vibrate in tune with the whole. When a person is too self-conscious he vibrates against the whole. When a person is no more self-conscious, simply conscious with no self in it, then he vibrates with the whole."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part23/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part23/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="23"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

You have to meditate much on vibrations and you have to learn how to vibrate in tune with the whole. When a person is too self-conscious he vibrates against the whole. When a person is no more self-conscious, simply conscious with no self in it, then he vibrates with the whole.\nThe self gives you a different rhythm and you fall apart. Man is not really separated, only he starts vibrating in a different rhythm from the whole – as if in an orchestra a musician falls out of tune. He is committing a sin because the whole harmony is being destroyed.\nThat is the only sin there is: to vibrate in such a way that you are not part of the whole. And this is the only virtue: to vibrate in such a way that you are not felt anywhere, that your presence is completely like absence.\nThe orchestra is perfect when the individual players are not felt separately, when they function as one individual. Then they are in harmony, then great music is born. Very transcendental music comes into being – it can take you far away beyond the stars. A single note out of tune, a single note out of harmony, and it distracts... the beauty is lost.\nSo remember more and more that the ego has to be dropped... that you are not to think of yourself as separate, as a unit independent from the whole, but just as a small wave in the ocean, waving with the ocean – not against, not lagging behind, not rushing ahead – just going with it.\nTo go with the whole is to be religious.\nDeep down we consist of vibrations, hence all the religions have paid so much attention to chanting, mantra, singing, bhajan – because a certain mantra can give you a certain vibration, can lead you to a certain wavelength where meeting becomes possible. Mantras are not to be used at random.\nIn the ancient days a master would give a mantra only when he had watched the disciple for many years... had watched in different situations and had come to feel what sound would give him the vibration that would lead him to the whole – not away, but into it.\nBut there are certain mantras which are universal in a way. They may not be absolutely fit for you but still they can give you a certain glimpse. Such is ‘aum’ – it has been found to help more people than any other mantra. It is just through experimentation down the centuries that many masters have felt that the sound ‘aum’ fits many people. Particularly men, it fits tremendously. It may not fit women, or may not fit so easily, but to men universally it fits.\nThe christian ‘amen’ and the mohammedan ‘amin’ are just forms of ‘aum’. It is the same sound – just little changes are there, but it is the same sound.\nAll the six great religions – Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism – all agree on one thing, and that is the sound ‘aum’. They don’t agree on anything else but they agree on one thing – that this sound ‘aum’ has something in it.\nIf you repeat it constantly deep inside, by and by it gives you a certain vibe and that vibe helps the ego to disappear and helps the whole to appear in your being. So you try that sound.\nWhen you are sitting silently, just get into it. Sometimes loudly chant it – ‘aum... aum...’ – and when you have become attuned to it there is no need to chant loudly. Then with closed mouth, just chant it inside, ‘aum... aum...’. When you have become more attuned, then even inside chanting is not needed.\nYou can simply close your eyes and wait for it and you will start hearing it somewhere in the heart. You will not be chanting it – you will be the hearer, the witness. It will be there vibrating; then the mantra has come home.\nAnd get into dancing here, music. Anything that concerns vibrations is going to help you – hence the name.\nPrem means love and pravesha means entry – entry into love. And to enter into sannyas is to enter into love.…\nMy whole idea of a total man is a man who can love unconditionally. When love is flowing unconditionally with no barriers, nothing else is to be achieved – one has come home. If love is not flowing you can become a great saint and you will remain in misery. If love is not flowing you can become a great scholar, theologian, philosopher – it is not going to change and transform you.\nOnly love transforms, because only through love does the ego disappear.\nSo to enter into sannyas is to enter into the world of love. It is the greatest courage, to love without any conditions... just to love for love’s sake – that’s what sannyas is all about. And love will immediately start changing you. It will bring a new climate and you will start flowering.\nBut remember, one has to be loving. You need not be worried about whether the other loves you in return or not. Never ask for love; love comes... comes a thousandfold. You go on giving and it comes; it is natural that it should come. It is a fundamental law that it will come back. Whatsoever we give comes back, so whatsoever you get, remember, you must have given it in some way or other.\nPeople think that nobody loves them, but that simply shows they have not loved. They think others are at fault, but they never sowed and they want to reap.\nSo if love comes to you, remember that you have learned how to give. Then give more and more will be coming. And never be a miser. It is not something that you can exhaust by giving – on the contrary, it increases.…\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says: It’s been a wonderful experience and painful in many ways.… Now I have to go back to society... and I’m not making any plans.]\nNo need... don’t make! Just go and things will happen. And when you don’t have any plans things happen more easily, and then you can allow whatsoever is happening. When you have plans you don’t allow, because you are always looking at the plans and comparing. You want things your way and things never happen your way. It is good that they don’t happen your way – otherwise you will never be out of the trap of the ego.\nThere is a basic law – that things never happen according to you, so each time you plan there is frustration. And frustration goes on piling up, piling up, and one day out of sheer frustration and hopelessness you stop planning. That very day things start happening. And then there is no possibility of any frustration because you have nothing to compare.\nSo whatsoever happens is good. Whatsoever happens had to happen, so it happened – you accept it. And when this acceptance is there, there is beauty, there is benediction.\nIn the groups also the pain arises because we don’t accept. The pain never comes from the group – the pain comes from our rejection: something we are not ready to accept, something we still want to protect. We have still some idea, some image, some ‘should’. That idea. that image. is shattered again and again in a group process .\nThe whole group processes are to shatter the self-image, because that is your imprisonment. So whenever something hurts the self-image and you start protecting, defending – maybe not very consciously, but unconsciously resisting – there is pain. If you allow it, there will be no pain.\nPain is out of resistance – resistance is pain. Sometimes try it when you are deeply in pain: accept the situation and see what happens. You will immediately see that the intensity of pain has disappeared... even in physical pain. It is absolutely true about psychological pain – that if you accept it, immediately it disappears, one hundred percent – but even in physical pain you will be surprised.\nYou have a headache, accept it. The very idea of ‘why should you have a headache? why does it only happen to you and nobody else? – everybody is so happy and you are suffering from a headache’ You accept the head, you reject the headache.\nIf you reject your head, even the head will become a headache. Reject anything.…\nAccept the headache – that it is okay. It had to happen, so it is happening; this is the way things are. Relax, and immediately you will see that the intensity of it is gone. And the more you become able to relax into it, the more and more it disappears.\nA point can be reached where even physical pain becomes almost nil. And once you have learned that, you have a great insight into things. Then you know hell is your creation... and so is heaven!\nGroup processes are painful – not because they are painful but because we resist; we don’t go with them. We go only so far and then comes the barrier. Something immediately shuts in – a door closes; you are stuck. In fact that is the moment to go again, to flow again. But it is natural, it is human, forgivable; nothing to be worried about.\nBack home, look at life as an on-going group – it is! Millions of people are involved – it is a big group: the whole earth! And thousands of processes are going on. Once you start looking at life as a long, big, on-going group process, you will be infinitely benefited. Just try to look that way. Somebody insults you – take it as if you are in a group. Then you will not take it seriously: it is a game, you can laugh at it and you can take it very relaxedly. Then even that man will be affected by your relaxation. He will be puzzled, because he was not expecting this. In fact you have frustrated him!\nWhen somebody insults you and you laugh, you frustrate him. He was expecting that you would get angry; in fact he was provoking you to anger by insulting you. He wanted you to feel hurt and you are smiling.\nYou have sabotaged his whole system, and so subtly that he will feel impotent, he will feel embarrassed he will not be able to figure it out; he will not be able to sleep the whole night! He will turn again and again in the bed and will think, ‘What happened? Has this man completely changed or is he mad? Or has he gone so beyond, has become so aware... what has happened?’\nNot reacting to his insults, you have created a great situation for him too. He will have to reckon with it, he will have to do something about it, otherwise it will haunt him. If you had reacted in the ordinary way there would have been no problem – he was expecting it and it was okay. In fact he would have felt happy that he provoked you, that he pulled you down.\nSo take the whole life as a big group process. Move into it with fun, thinking all are games. That’s the meaning of the hindu term ‘maya’ – that the whole life is a game. Don’t take it seriously. It is a big stage, huge – the whole earth functions as a stage and all human beings function as actors.\nTake it in that way and within three, four months, you will have such tremendous freedom that you cannot even imagineYou will simply be freed from all nonsense.\nAnd when something happens in your body, some pain, anything, try to accept it, relax with it. It may have some message for you – listen to the message. Much more is going to happen. These days have been very meaningful.…\n[A visitor asks: You say that we should seek out danger – to leave the valley and to climb the Himalayas.\nIs this camp and the ashram a valley or a Himalayas?]\nBecome a sannyasin and experience! If you want to know from the beginning before you enter into it, then you want it to be a secure place.\nDanger means going into the unknown, so I will not say what it is because if you already know what it is then there is nothing left like the unknown. It is an unknown thing – in fact nobody knows! Enter into it and see what it is.\nIt is both, mm? and everything has to be both because everything exists with a polarity. The peaks never exist alone, they exist with the valley. The valley never exists alone, it exists with the peak; it is both! It is both: sometimes you are in the valley and some-times you are at the peak.\nAnd my teaching is that both are good – one should start enjoying both. One should enjoy happiness and one should become also capable of enjoying unhappiness. One should enjoy the day and the night also... life and death too.\nOne should not choose. Whatsoever comes, one should be able to find a way to enjoy it. Then life is an adventure and everything opens new doors which you have never opened before.\nSo don’t think about it – become a sannyasin!\nIf you are really in search of danger... but if you are in search of security, you can think about it for a few days, mm?\n[Another visitor says: Can you love more than one person or is it just that love is a general feeling for many people? I think my confusion stems from something you said in the lecture about when you love someone, that person is... for me it would be all men. Is that possible?]\nLove has many dimensions to it. The first dimension of love is that of passion, of great passion. Then you can love only one person at one time because the passion needs your totality. Passion is an intensity. If you love two, three persons or many persons, your passion will be dissipated, spread-over. It will be lukewarm – it will not be a fire.\nSo passionate love has to be directed to one person so that your whole energy moves like a flood in one direction. That is the meaning of passion.\nBut there is a compassionate love that is another direction, another dimension. Then there is no question – you can love the whole humanity; you can love the trees and the animals, and all that exists... you can love the whole existence. But then there is no passion – there is compassion. It is very cool, it is not hot. A buddha loves that way... Jesus loves that way.\nYour confusion is between two different dimensions of love. You have to be clear-cut about these two different things. Passion is passion – compassion is compassion. Compassion can be for the whole, because it is a cool phenomenon; there is no heat in it. It has its own beauty because it is cool, it is not feverish.\nBut the passionate love has its own beauty too. Because it is so hot you bum with intensity – you become a flame of desire. You are pouring yourself into one being, that one being is all and all. If you love a man, that man is the only man in the world, then all men have simply faded away. They are there but they are no more in your focus.\nThis one man represents all humanity – past, present, future. This man is an archetype. Personified in him is all humanity. And when you pour your love with tremendous intensity, not holding anything, you are also not a single woman – you are all women, past, present, future. You are also an archetype.\nIn a passionate love the man is not just man, the woman is not just woman: they are anima and animus.\nThat is the beauty – a tremendous peak of energy. It is beautiful but it has troubles also, problems also. Jealousy will be there, possessiveness will be there, fight, quarrelling, nagging will be there, intolerance will be there, domination will be there. These problems will be there, they come in the same package.\nOf course there will be great moments and there will be many moments of hell too – that is the price one has to pay.\nIn the compassionate love there are no more such peaks of passion – it is very cool. You will never bum, you will never be afire and aflame. But then there are beauties of coolness: you will never be jealous, you will never be intolerant, never nagging, fighting, quarrelling. These things will disappear... they come with fire.\nWhen the fire is there. there is much smoke. You cannot avoid the smoke if you love the fire. You have to learn to tolerate the smoke. If you want the smoke to go absolutely, the fire has to be cooled down – it goes only when the fire has gone.\nAnd I am not saying do this or that – I am simply explaining to you that these are the two possibilities of life.\nEveryone has to pass from the first. One who has not passed from the first will never be able to reach the second – that much is certain. So never try to jump to the second before you have learned the first. The first is a necessary step to the second. It purifies you... that fire purifies your gold. That love teaches you a thousand and one things. It makes you capable of compassion. The very understanding of love, the suffering of love, the joy and the suffering both, make you capable to understand compassion.\nThen one day love remains, passion has disappeared. The intensity, the feverishness is gone, it is a cool breeze. Then you can love the whole. Both are beautiful and both are not antagonistic – rather, both are two aspects of the same phenomenon.\nThe first has to be passed through, so there is no need to be confused. These are two different dimensions. Through passion arises understanding that makes one compassionate.\n[A sannyasin describes an experience he had when he went to sleep on the evening after the full- moon. He became scared about not breathing and panicked about dying. The following day he felt shakey and dizzy.\nOsho checked his energy.]\nMm, very good! Open your eyes. It has been good, mm? Nothing to be sad about. It will happen again and again – you have to allow it. Don’t try to analyse and don’t try to figure out what it is – no need. It is simply beautiful... something that cannot be understood by the mind and should not be understood by the mind.\nIf the mind tries to understand it, it may become a barrier, and if the mind starts thinking that it has understood, it will stop. So let it remain a mystery – just allow it, more will be happening. And each full moon, wait for it. By and by it will start happening on Other nights also.\nOn the full moon, wait for it. Prepare for the full noon: take a bath, sing a song, dance; if you can play on some instrument, play. Sit silently when the moon rises and just look at the moon – sometimes with open eyes, sometimes with closed eyes – and wait for it.\nIt will come again and again, and more and more and deeper and deeper it will go.\n... Just don’t be worried about it! Even if [the breathing] stops, that is my worry! If it stops, it stops – don’t be worried about it; don’t try to do anything. You may feel that it is stopping, but it never stops. It simply becomes so slow that you cannot feel it.\nWhen the mind slows down, the breathing also slows down. When the mind comes to a stop, the breathing also almost comes to a stop... almost – just one percent it remains but so subtle that vou cannot see it.\nIn Zen monasteries, when somebody reaches to meditation, they judge it by putting a mirror close to his nose. If no vapour comes on the mirror, then he is in the state. That means that the breathing is so slow that the mirror is not affected at all.\nIt is beautiful – just continue! And beautiful things never should be analysed – never should be analysed. Analysis is poisonous.\nSo I give my blessing – I will not say anything about it – you simply go on, mm? Good!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3526","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/>What Is, Is, What Ain\'t, Ain\'t</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3526 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/What_Is_Is_What_Aint_Aint/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

not be absolutely fit for you but still they can give you a certain
glimpse. Such is ‘aum’ – it has been found to help more people than any
other mantra. It is just through experimentation down the centuries that
many masters have felt that the sound ‘aum’ fits many people.
Particularly men, it fits tremendously. It may not fit women, or may not
fit so easily, but to men universally it fits.</p><p><br></p><p>The christian ‘amen’ and the mohammedan ‘amin’ are just forms of
‘aum’. It is the same sound – just little changes are there, but it is
the same sound.</p><p><br></p><p>All the six great religions – Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism,
Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism – all agree on one thing, and that is the
sound ‘aum’. They don’t agree on anything else but they agree on one
thing – that this sound ‘aum’ has something in it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you repeat it constantly deep inside, by and by it gives you a
certain vibe and that vibe helps the ego to disappear and helps the
whole to appear in your being. So you try that sound.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are sitting silently, just get into it. Sometimes loudly
chant it – ‘aum... aum...’ – and when you have become attuned to it
there is no need to chant loudly. Then with closed mouth, just chant it
inside, ‘aum... aum...’. When you have become more attuned, then even
inside chanting is not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>You can simply close your eyes and wait for it and you will start
hearing it somewhere in the heart. You will not be chanting it – you
will be the hearer, the witness. It will be there vibrating; then the
mantra has come home.</p><p><br></p><p>And get into dancing here, music. Anything that concerns vibrations
is going to help you – hence the name.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love and pravesha means entry – entry into love. And to
enter into sannyas is to enter into love.…</p><p>My whole idea of a total man is a man who can love unconditionally.
When love is flowing unconditionally with no barriers, nothing else is
to be achieved – one has come home. If love is not flowing you can
become a great saint and you will remain in misery. If love is not
flowing you can become a great scholar, theologian, philosopher – it is
not going to change and transform you.</p><p><br></p><p>Only love transforms, because only through love does the ego
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>So to enter into sannyas is to enter into the world of love. It is
the greatest courage, to love without any conditions... just to love for
love’s sake – that’s what sannyas is all about. And love will
immediately start changing you. It will bring a new climate and you will
start flowering.</p><p>But remember, one has to be loving. You need not be worried about
whether the other loves you in return or not. Never ask for love; love
comes... comes a thousandfold. You go on giving and it comes; it is
natural that it should come. It is a fundamental law that it will come
back. Whatsoever we give comes back, so whatsoever you get, remember,
you must have given it in some way or other.</p><p><br></p><p>People think that nobody loves them, but that simply shows they have
not loved. They think others are at fault, but they never sowed and they
want to reap.</p><p><br></p><p>So if love comes to you, remember that you have learned how to give.
Then give more and more will be coming. And never be a miser. It is not
something that you can exhaust by giving – on the contrary, it
increases.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving says: It’s been a wonderful experience
and painful in many ways.… Now I have to go back to society... and I’m
not making any plans.]</p><p><br></p><p>No need... don’t make! Just go and things will happen. And when you
don’t have any plans things happen more easily, and then you can allow
whatsoever is happening. When you have plans you don’t allow, because
you are always looking at the plans and comparing. You want things your
way and things never happen your way. It is good that they don’t happen
your way – otherwise you will never be out of the trap of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a basic law – that things never happen according to you, so
each time you plan there is frustration. And frustration goes on piling
up, piling up, and one day out of sheer frustration and hopelessness you
stop planning. That very day things start happening. And then there is
no possibility of any frustration because you have nothing to
compare.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever happens is good. Whatsoever happens had to happen, so
it happened – you accept it. And when this acceptance is there, there is
beauty, there is benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>In the groups also the pain arises because we don’t accept. The pain
never comes from the group – the pain comes from our rejection:
something we are not ready to accept, something we still want to
protect. We have still some idea, some image, some ‘should’. That idea.
that image. is shattered again and again in a group process .</p><p><br></p><p>The whole group processes are to shatter the self-image, because that
is your imprisonment. So whenever something hurts the self-image and you
start protecting, defending – maybe not very consciously, but
unconsciously resisting – there is pain. If you allow it, there will be
no pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Pain is out of resistance – resistance is pain. Sometimes try it when
you are deeply in pain: accept the situation and see what happens. You
will immediately see that the intensity of pain has disappeared... even
in physical pain. It is absolutely true about psychological pain – that
if you accept it, immediately it disappears, one hundred percent – but
even in physical pain you will be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>You have a headache, accept it. The very idea of ‘why should you have
a headache? why does it only happen to you and nobody else? – everybody
is so happy and you are suffering from a headache<span class=s4></span>’ You accept the head, you reject the headache.</p><p>If you reject your head, even the head will become a headache. Reject
anything.…</p><p><br></p><p>Accept the headache – that it is okay. It had to happen, so it is
happening; this is the way things are. Relax, and immediately you will
see that the intensity of it is gone. And the more you become able to
relax into it, the more and more it disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>A point can be reached where even physical pain becomes almost nil.
And once you have learned that, you have a great insight into things.
Then you know hell is your creation... and so is heaven!</p><p><br></p><p>Group processes are painful – not because they are painful but
because we resist; we don’t go with them. We go only so far and then
comes the barrier. Something immediately shuts in – a door closes; you
are stuck. In fact that is the moment to go again, to flow again. But it
is natural, it is human, forgivable; nothing to be worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>Back home, look at life as an on-going group – it is! Millions of
people are involved – it is a big group: the whole earth! And thousands
of processes are going on. Once you start looking at life as a long,
big, on-going group process, you will be infinitely benefited. Just try
to look that way. Somebody insults you – take it as if you are in a
group. Then you will not take it seriously: it is a game, you can laugh
at it and you can take it very relaxedly. Then even that man will be
affected by your relaxation. He will be puzzled, because he was not
expecting this. In fact you have frustrated him!</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody insults you and you laugh, you frustrate him. He was
expecting that you would get angry; in fact he was provoking you to
anger by insulting you. He wanted you to feel hurt and you are
smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>You have sabotaged his whole system, and so subtly that he will feel
impotent, he will feel embarrassed he will not be able to figure it out;
he will not be able to sleep the whole night! He will turn again and
again in the bed and will think, ‘What happened? Has this man completely
changed or is he mad? Or has he gone so beyond, has become so aware...
what has happened?’</p><p><br></p><p>Not reacting to his insults, you have created a great situation for
him too. He will have to reckon with it, he will have to do something
about it, otherwise it will haunt him. If you had reacted in the
ordinary way there would have been no problem – he was expecting it and
it was okay. In fact he would have felt happy that he provoked you, that
he pulled you down.</p><p><br></p><p>So take the whole life as a big group process. Move into it with fun,
thinking all are games. That’s the meaning of the hindu term ‘maya’ –
that the whole life is a game. Don’t take it seriously. It is a big
stage, huge – the whole earth functions as a stage and all human beings
function as actors.</p><p><br></p><p>Take it in that way and within three, four months, you will have such
tremendous freedom that you cannot even imagine<span class=s4></span>You will simply be freed from all nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>And when something happens in your body, some pain, anything, try to
accept it, relax with it. It may have some message for you – listen to
the message. Much more is going to happen. These days have been very
meaningful.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor asks: You say that we should seek out danger – to leave
the valley and to climb the Himalayas.</p><p>Is this camp and the ashram a valley or a Himalayas?]</p><p><br></p><p>Become a sannyasin and experience! If you want to know from the
beginning before you enter into it, then you want it to be a secure
place.</p><p><br></p><p>Danger means going into the unknown, so I will not say what it is
because if you already know what it is then there is nothing left like
the unknown. It is an unknown thing – in fact nobody knows! Enter into
it and see what it is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is both, mm? and everything has to be both because everything
exists with a polarity. The peaks never exist alone, they exist with the
valley. The valley never exists alone, it exists with the peak; it is
both! It is both: sometimes you are in the valley and some-times you are
at the peak.</p><p><br></p><p>And my teaching is that both are good – one should start enjoying
both. One should enjoy happiness and one should become also capable of
enjoying unhappiness. One should enjoy the day and the night also...
life and death too.</p><p><br></p><p>One should not choose. Whatsoever comes, one should be able to find a
way to enjoy it. Then life is an adventure and everything opens new
doors which you have never opened before.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t think about it – become a sannyasin!</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really in search of danger... but if you are in search of
security, you can think about it for a few days, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[Another visitor says: Can you love more than one person or is it
just that love is a general feeling for many people? I think my
confusion stems from something you said in the lecture about when you
love someone, that person is... for me it would be all men. Is that
possible?]</p><p><br></p><p>Love has many dimensions to it. The first dimension of love is that
of passion, of great passion. Then you can love only one person at one
time because the passion needs your totality. Passion is an intensity.
If you love two, three persons or many persons, your passion will be
dissipated, spread-over. It will be lukewarm – it will not be a
fire.</p><p><br></p><p>So passionate love has to be directed to one person so that your
whole energy moves like a flood in one direction. That is the meaning of
passion.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is a compassionate love that is another direction, another
dimension. Then there is no question – you can love the whole humanity;
you can love the trees and the animals, and all that exists... you can
love the whole existence. But then there is no passion – there is
compassion. It is very cool, it is not hot. A buddha loves that way...
Jesus loves that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Your confusion is between two different dimensions of love. You have
to be clear-cut about these two different things. Passion is passion –
compassion is compassion. Compassion can be for the whole, because it is
a cool phenomenon; there is no heat in it. It has its own beauty because
it is cool, it is not feverish.</p><p>But the passionate love has its own beauty too. Because it is so hot
you bum with intensity – you become a flame of desire. You are pouring
yourself into one being, that one being is all and all. If you love a
man, that man is the only man in the world, then all men have simply
faded away. They are there but they are no more in your focus.</p><p><br></p><p>This one man represents all humanity – past, present, future. This
man is an archetype. Personified in him is all humanity. And when you
pour your love with tremendous intensity, not holding anything, you are
also not a single woman – you are all women, past, present, future. You
are also an archetype.</p><p><br></p><p>In a passionate love the man is not just man, the woman is not just
woman: they are anima and animus.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the beauty – a tremendous peak of energy. It is beautiful but
it has troubles also, problems also. Jealousy will be there,
possessiveness will be there, fight, quarrelling, nagging will be there,
intolerance will be there, domination will be there. These problems will
be there, they come in the same package.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course there will be great moments and there will be many moments
of hell too – that is the price one has to pay.</p><p><br></p><p>In the compassionate love there are no more such peaks of passion –
it is very cool. You will never bum, you will never be afire and aflame.
But then there are beauties of coolness: you will never be jealous, you
will never be intolerant, never nagging, fighting, quarrelling. These
things will disappear... they come with fire.</p><p><br></p><p>When the fire is there. there is much smoke. You cannot avoid the
smoke if you love the fire. You have to learn to tolerate the smoke. If
you want the smoke to go absolutely, the fire has to be cooled down – it
goes only when the fire has gone.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying do this or that – I am simply explaining to you
that these are the two possibilities of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone has to pass from the first. One who has not passed from the
first will never be able to reach the second – that much is certain. So
never try to jump to the second before you have learned the first. The
first is a necessary step to the second. It purifies you... that fire
purifies your gold. That love teaches you a thousand and one things. It
makes you capable of compassion. The very understanding of love, the
suffering of love, the joy and the suffering both, make you capable to
understand compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day love remains, passion has disappeared. The intensity,
the feverishness is gone, it is a cool breeze. Then you can love the
whole. Both are beautiful and both are not antagonistic – rather, both
are two aspects of the same phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>The first has to be passed through, so there is no need to be
confused. These are two different dimensions. Through passion arises
understanding that makes one compassionate.</p><p>[A sannyasin describes an experience he had when he went to sleep on
the evening after the full- moon. He became scared about not breathing
and panicked about dying. The following day he felt shakey and
dizzy.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checked his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, very good! Open your eyes. It has been good, mm? Nothing to be
sad about. It will happen again and again – you have to allow it. Don’t
try to analyse and don’t try to figure out what it is – no need. It is
simply beautiful... something that cannot be understood by the mind and
should not be understood by the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If the mind tries to understand it, it may become a barrier, and if
the mind starts thinking that it has understood, it will stop. So let it
remain a mystery – just allow it, more will be happening. And each full
moon, wait for it. By and by it will start happening on Other nights
also.</p><p><br></p><p>On the full moon, wait for it. Prepare for the full noon: take a
bath, sing a song, dance; if you can play on some instrument, play. Sit
silently when the moon rises and just look at the moon – sometimes with
open eyes, sometimes with closed eyes – and wait for it.</p><p><br></p><p>It will come again and again, and more and more and deeper and deeper
it will go.</p><p><br></p><p>... Just don’t be worried about it! Even if [the breathing] stops,
that is my worry! If it stops, it stops – don’t be worried about it;
don’t try to do anything. You may feel that it is stopping, but it never
stops. It simply becomes so slow that you cannot feel it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind slows down, the breathing also slows down. When the
mind comes to a stop, the breathing also almost comes to a stop...
almost – just one percent it remains but so subtle that vou cannot see
it.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen monasteries, when somebody reaches to meditation, they judge
it by putting a mirror close to his nose. If no vapour comes on the
mirror, then he is in the state. That means that the breathing is so
slow that the mirror is not affected at all.</p><p><br></p><p>It is beautiful – just continue! And beautiful things never should be
analysed – never should be analysed. Analysis is poisonous.</p><p><br></p><p>So I give my blessing – I will not say anything about it – you simply
go on, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

That’s what life is meant to be. Life consists of small things, so I don’t call it a very big song – I call it a small song. Song, not with a capital ‘S’ – a lower case ‘s’. Life consists of very small things, and one has to learn the small song of life.\nThe ego wants to sing a very big, great, song – hence there is so much frustration in the world. Unless you start enjoying the small things, you will never be able to be happy. And out of small enjoyments, great joy arises, but that has not to be looked for directly, that has not to be sought directly; it comes on its own.\nYou go on singing a small song and one day you see that all the songs have fallen together. They have become a great harmony, they have created a great song. It takes you unawares... one day it possesses you. Otherwise that great song is missed and these small songs are also missed. Life remains a desert, a frustration, a fruitless, meaningless phenomenon.\nSo try to change small things into great things. That is the one message in your name ‘anugita’.… And the song has to be of love, because the song can be of war, the song can be of hatred, jealousy, ambition. The song can be of conflict, struggle, violence, but then it is not a song. A song should be of love.\nSo these two things: pour your love into the small things of life and create a harmony.\nAnd it is not difficult, but because we go on looking at the faraway stars, it becomes difficult. Look around, close by... god is not very far away. And it is the window of love that opens you into god.\nRemember that religion is not a serious thing; it is more like a song than anything else... it is more like a dance, laughter. It is a great rejoicing, so don’t think of it in serious terms. Don’t become a serious enquirer – let it be fun.\nPlay around the idea of god, dance around the idea of god, and you will reach sooner!\nDeva means divine, arjuna means innocence – divine innocence. And Arjuna is also the name of the disciple of Krishna in the great hindu scripture ‘geeta’. Have you read ‘geeta’? Read it some time. Mm? – it is one of the most beautiful books ever written or that will ever be written.\nKrishna is the master, Arjuna is the disciple. Arjuna asks questions and Krishna answers... very insightful answers. The disciple is also tremendously keen, enquiring, is not easy to convince, struggles with the master, argues with the master, and finally – only when all his questions are answered, when not a single question remains and all questions disappear – does he surrender. The book is tremendously beautiful, for every enquirer it is very good to study.\nThe disciple’s name is also Arjuna, but the word literally means ‘innocence’. A disciple has to be innocent, otherwise he will never learn. Learning is always out of innocence. If a person feels he knows, he will never learn. A person who thinks he knows is not innocent. A person who knows that he doesn’t know is innocent, like a child who knows nothing.\nBut only when you don’t know anything are you capable of knowing. Then you are clean. There is no screen of theories and words; your vision is clear. There is a crystal clarity, a transparency, and one can see things as they are.\nSo never gather knowledge – remain innocent. Know something, forget about it... throw it away! Once you have known something it is meaningless, it is rubbish. Again become innocent.\nAnd remember always that the innocence has to be regained again and again, then you will know more and more and more. And one day when innocence becomes perfect and total, god descends.\nSo innocence is your meditation. Don’t be clever and cunning, don’t be calculating. Even if you have to lose much because of your innocence, it is worth it.\nA man can accumulate many things through cunning, cleverness, but he loses his life. An innocent man may lose everything but he gains... he gains the real treasure – something that cannot be destroyed by death. That is the meaning when Jesus says again and again, ‘In my kingdom of god only those who are like children will enter... innocent, ignorant, humble.’\n[A visitor, the sister of a sannyasin, in answer to Osho’s invitation to take sannyas says: NoI have\nto be very sure before I do anything.]\nThen you will never do it! Because this is a thing you can never be sure about.unless you do it! It\nis like love. If you want to become sure about love and only then will you love, you will never love – how will you know? It is like death, you will know only when you die; how will you know beforehand?\nAnd everything else you have done without knowing. You were born and you never knew what was going to happen. You were not ready beforehand, but you were born and everything has gone well. You go on breathing and you never think whether to breathe or not.\nLife is not a question to be decided – it is something to be lived! One simply has to move into things, and whenever a new thing comes across your path, get into it! You have nothing to lose and all to gain; what can you lose ?\nBut if you avoid the new and you cling to the old you will miss many things in life.\nAnd remember, when you want to say no, hesitate – because no is not a good word. It is in the service of death, the word no – yes is in the service of life. When you want to say yes say it certainly, but when you want to say no, hesitate.\n[She answers: I’ve been thinking about it since I’m here.]\nYou are thinking but thinking is not going to help. That’s why I asked you, ‘Have you something to say?’ I feel that you have been thinking about it, but you will not even gather enough courage to ask!\nYou can go on thinking but thinking is not going ro lead you anywhere. It has nothing to do with thinking – it is a very mad thing. One never becomes mad by thinking.\nDon’t decide – just become! And then later on you can think. Then you have your whole life to think about it (chuckling). And then it will be easier, because you will have something to think about! (laughter)\nRight now what will you think? How will you think about what this sannyas is? But if you want to think, you are free to think – you can continue thinking! But remember, you will be missing an opportunity. One should be courageous enough to do a few things without thinking. And how can one think about something which one does not know?\nIf I ask you, ‘Would you like to come into my room?’ and you say ‘First I will think’.But you don’t\nknow anything about my room! The saner procedure will be to say, ‘Okay, I am coming. Let me see.’ If you feel good, remain. Otherwise you are free, you can go; nothing to be worried about.\nBut if you want to think, you think, mm? How many days do you want for thinking? (laughter) I am a salesman!\n[Another visitor says: I want to be a part, but is it possible at another time? I want to be close to you.]\nYou are getting close, and you will get closer, mm? It is happening, nothing to be worried about. And one thing is good about you – you are not a thinker! (a chuckle) You function from your feeling, it is very much easier.\nI am here for those people who can feel, and the people who can feel are always more courageous. Thinking is a very cowardly activity. It only prevents you – it is negative. It simply shows you the dangers – that this can happen, this can happen, this can happen; it simply gives you the negative part.\nThe heart is the positive centre... it gives you the positive part. So only people who are heart oriented move into truth, into god. Others simply think and think and then die! And nothing ever happens to thinkers.\nSo good! I can feel that your energy is perfectly good.\nJust feel.In two, three days you will be drowned. Mm? about you I can be certain! (chuckling)\n[A sannyasin said that she did not believe in God so she found some difficulty in relating to the word when Osho used it.]\nThere is no need to believeand I am not talking about a god who has to be believed in. Whenever\nI say ‘god’, always translate it as ‘life’ and the problem will be solved. Whenever I say ‘god’, translate it as ‘life’.\nI love that word so I use it, but otherwise it is useless, mm? So don’t be worried about it. Life is god.and there is no other god! Mm? Good!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1592","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/>What Is, Is, What Ain\'t, Ain\'t</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1592 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/What_Is_Is_What_Aint_Aint/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

One member says: At first I didn’t like it, bu the second half of the group I liked very much.]\nAlways remember that even if you don’t like a certain thing, it is not necessarily bad. Liking and disliking makes no difference. Sometimes the thing that you like may be harmful, and vice versa: the thing that you don’t like at all may prove a great transformation. In fact that is more likely.\nThe thing that you don’t like is more likely to help you, because liking comes out of the past, liking comes out of your mind. The mind likes that which hts with it, and anything that fits with the mind is never going to change you. Anything whatsoever that fits with the mind will strengthen the same mind, will make it even stronger.\nSo something that the mind feels repelled by has to be explored. There is a possibility that it may prove a radical change in your life. And right now you misunderstand because you are identified too much with the mind. You don’t know what is really beneficial and what is not. Whatsoever you decide, you decide through the mind. You don’t know yet how to look at things without the mind interfering.\nNow for example, this: if you had listened to the mind, the mind was telling you, ‘Leave! It is pointless, and why are you wasting your time? I don’t like it!’ That mind tries to say that you don’t like it, and you are so identified that you don’t make the distinction that this is the mind saying, ‘I don’t like it.’ But the mind’s liking or disliking is not your liking or disliking. You are separate from the mind, different from the mind.\nSo sometimes try that which the mind does not like, and sometimes don’t try that to which the mind feels attracted and likes. Go on playing with this game. By and by the mind and you become loose,\nand then you have a tremendously new perspective. Then sometimes it happens that you can see a thing without the mind coming in, because now you are loose, not so tightly attached to each other.\nThis loosening comes only when you sometimes go on trying the thing that the mind does not like, and sometimes not trying the thing that the mind likes.\nGurdjieff used to use this technique very much.\nSomebody would come who was a vegetarian and who was absolutely against meat-eating and non-vegetarian food. Gurdjieff would force him to eat non-vegetarian food. Now it was repelling – to a person who has never touched meat and to a person who has always preached vegetarianism there cannot be anything more repulsive. Suddenly this man says, ‘Eat meat, otherwise I don’t allow you here... otherwise leave me!’\nNow he had to choose between Gurdjieff and vegetarianism – and that is too much! When you have come in close proximity to a person like gurdjieff it becomes very difficult not to choose him. To eat meat is nauseating for a person who has always been against it, but gurdjieff would force him.\nSometimes, to a meat-eater, Gurdjieff would say, ‘Stop meat-eating completely. Become vegetarian.’ For somebody who never drank he would go on forcing him to drink more and more till he was completely lost. To somebody who drank he would tell them to stop it. That was a way of loosening the mind from the person.\nTo somebody who hated manual work Gurdjieff would give manual work. He had a great insight into finding what people hated – and he would immediately find out what it wasAnd sometimes very\nsurprisingly.\nJust a few days before, I was reading a memoir.… A doctor – Gurdjieff’s doctor, his own private physician – has written in his memoirs that the first time he came in contact with Gurdjieff the thing that impressed him was his tremendous insight.\nA woman had come with this doctor to Gurdjieff for the first time. Gurdjieff used to see people only at the dining table every evening – thirty, forty, sometimes fifty and sometimes one hundred people in a small room, crowded. This woman had come with the doctor for the first time – a young beautiful woman – and she was sitting by the side of a very old woman.must have been like our bhakti\n(italian and elderly, she is an ashramite), white-haired.\nGurdjieff used to prepare plates, and he would say to whom a plate should go. He prepared a plate and said, ‘It goes to the mum.’ So the people who took the plate thought he was indicating the old woman – naturally, because she was the oldest woman there and he had said, ‘This goes to the mum.’\nBut when the disciple took the plate to the old woman, Gurdjieff said, ‘No, the other one.’ The young woman was by the side of the old woman and nobody could believe why he was calling her ‘mum’. That young woman started crying! The doctor was also puzzled.\nOnly later on did he come to know that that woman was really a mum – she was a mother to her children, she was a mother to her husband too! She was mothering everybody... she was even mothering her own father. Her whole life was concentrated on that point.\nGurdjieff had an insight into where people were. In fact a master can work only when he has that insight, otherwise there is no work possible. And he will immediately bring out the thing that you don’t like. The woman started crying because that was the one thing she never liked to be told. Mm? that was one thing that used to hurt her very much. She knew it – it was like a wound. She had come for the first time and this man had caught hold of her!\nGurdjieff would always give just the opposite. To somebody who likes physical exercise very much, goes for a morning walk, evening walk, horse-riding, this and that, Gurdjieff would say to just sit silently and not to do anything. He would feel restless and would boil inside.\nBut this is the way the mind and you become loose.\nWhen you don’t listen to the mind, a distance arises. So learn this one thing from this experience – don’t decide in a hurry.\nSometimes you don’t like a woman and she may prove the best companion. Sometimes you like the woman at the first sight – you ‘fall in love’ as it is said – and she may prove the worst enemy to you. That’s how it is happening all over the world: people fall in love at first sight and then they suffer their whole life. Because this is decided by the mind... and the mind is blind!\nThe mind has no awareness. Awareness is a totally different thing, far away from mind, and awareness becomes available only when the mind is no more making its chattering, its noise, so you can hear the still, small voice, from somewhere beyond the mind.\nKeep it as a key, and sometimes go on trying something against the mind. Enjoy it, and you will be benefited tremendously.\n[A sannyasin asks: I feel a little confused about what I call the will and surrender. It is something very difficult for me to find the right attitude towards surrendering.]\nDon’t make a problem out of it. Surrendering is really nothing against the will. The moment you start thinking that surrendering is against the will, it looks like a problem.\nSurrendering is not against the will at all – in fact it is a flowering of the will, it is the culmination of the will. Only a person who has tremendous will can surrender. A weak person cannot surrender. A weak person may say that he has surrendered, but he has nothing to surrender. He is hiding his impotence behind a beautiful word – surrender is a beautiful word, and you can hide behind it. But he has nothing to surrender! What will you surrender if you don’t have the will?\nSo to me, surrender and will are not opposites. Surrender is the final crescendo. So nothing to be worried about. With me, opposites are not opposites but complementaries – that has to be always remembered. Whenever you are creating some division and thinking in terms of opposites, always remember that my insistence is that there are no opposites, everything is complementary. It is only great will that makes it possible for surrender to happen. They are not against each other.\nSo don’t create any conflict and don’t start thinking, ‘What is my way: will or surrender?’ Wherever you are and whatsoever you are, learn to accept it. If there is will, good – you have to grow your will.\nOne day when a grown-up will is there, a mature will is there, you will see – now the ripe will wants to fall like a ripe fruit.\nOnly unripe fruits resist – a ripe fruit simply falls of its own accord. When a real man of will comes to me he immediately surrenders. There is no problem about it... he does not hesitate at all. But when the will is not ripe, then the hesitation... natural hesitation. And there is nothing wrong in it – it Simply shows that you need a little more mature will. So wherever you are, go on moving in the same direction.\nI am not interested in changing your directions and I don’t want to give you something towards which you were not growing on your own – no, not at all! Whatsoever your goal, wherever your natural movement, I help it that way. If you find that will is the thing that goes naturally with you, go into it deeply, go totally. Then that is your discipline and that is my teaching for you. Go into it as deeply.… Get in tune with your will. And one day you will find that now the fruit is ripe and the fruit wants to fall to the earth. The ripe will, of its own accord, changes its quality and be-comes surrender.\nAnd this has to be the basic key for all opposites in every path wherever people divide. Somebody comes and says, ‘What is my path – reason or love?’ Unless you have a very grown-up reason you will not be able to fall into love. You will always be afraid, hesitant, reluctant; you will go only so far, because the reason will not be able to decide totally. Only a very mature reason can decide totally.\nSomebody comes and asks, ‘What is my right attitude: belief or faith? Reason or faith? Action or inaction? Feminine or masculine? Yin or yang?’ And my approach is the same: that wherever you are finding yourself naturally, go in the same direction. If you can go into the same direction far enough, you will turn in the other direction automatically – because it is a wheel and everything turns into its opposite. That’s the whole secret of life. The day turns into night, the night turns into day.…\nThere is no need to be worried about what to choose – day automatically turns into night and night automatically turns into day; life turns into death, and death turns into life again. That’s how it moves, one has simply to accept!\nThe buddhists have the right word for it – ‘tathata’; one has to accept the suchness of things. Whatsoever is, is – accept it, and don’t hanker for the opposite. Go headlong into it, to the farthest end of it, and suddenly you will see that it has turned into its polar opposite... a miracle. And then you know that life is one.\nWill and surrender are two polarities of one energy, like negative and positive electricity. The positive electricity cannot exist without the negative – neither can the negative exist without the positive.\nSo will and surrender both exist in your being and both exist together. But will is more primary, so one has to go through the will. Surrender is more ultimate, so one has to go into surrender one day... but there is no need to force it, there is no need to cultivate it, because all that is cultivated is false. Only the natural, the spontaneous, that which comes on its own, is beautiful and true!\nSo simply accept your being, whatsoever, wheresoever it is – accept it totally. Let its suchness be welcomed – that this is where you are, this is how you are. You cannot be anywhere else and you\ncannot be anybody else. This is the way you are and this is the only way you are. This is the only way you can be in this moment. I am not talking about other moments, you will change, but in this moment this is the only way you can be. So why create anxiety ? Why become divided, split?\nLive the moment! Live the suchness of it and live it totally. And out of this lived moment, out of this lived suchness, the other will come – it will arise on its own. And when it comes on its own it is tremendously beautiful.\nSurrender will come, but that is the flowering. Will is like the seed and surrender is like the flower. Wait... nothing to be worried about. It is on the way, mm?\n[A sannyas couple ask about their relationship. The woman had had a car accident which caused many changes in her. The man said they had opposite temperaments; he felt blocked in expressing love.]\nI understand. It is something very fundamental to be understood. First, we are always attracted towards the opposite person, the opposite type. People fall in love with the opposite type, because if you are in love with somebody who is just like you, you will feel as if you are in love with your twin – and that will be monotonous. It will be as if you are in love with your own picture, with your own mirror-reflection.\nOnly very egoistic persons fall in love with the same type of person – very very egoistic people... narcissistic. They fall in love with a person who is just like them, a carbon copy. But then they have other problems, their ego creates the problem.\nThey don’t allow the other any freedom whatsoever, because any freedom seems to be a betrayal. The other has to be just a replica, exact and precise. The other should not be allowed nay individuality. If the other asserts any individuality there is conflict – and how can the other be just a replica? Then there is pretension, hypocrisy. People wear masks and pretend, but then love disappears; love is not possible.\nIn that way there is a problem, because the person is only in love with his own ego and he wants the other to fit exactly with his ego – that’s not possible. Either the other is killed – then there is a dead person, and you cannot love a dead person.And if the other is alive you cannot love, because you\nwant him to be just a replica, just a copy to your being; so you are asking the impossible. Either way there is frustration. But this happens in only one percent of cases.\nIn ninety-nine percent of cases the other type of problem arises – we fall in love with the opposite type of person. In fact that is real heterosexuality. It is not only a question of a man falling in love with a woman; it is really two polarities falling in love with each other.\nThat’s why I am not in favour of homosexual tendencies – because they are egoistic. You are falling in love with somebody who is just like you – a man or a woman: a woman falling in love with a woman or a man falling in love with a man. That is very egoistic and juvenile, immature.\nHeterosexuality brings another type of problem, because it brings great challenges. The first challenge is that the other is other – you are a man and she is a woman – and from there\ntemperaments are different. And not only that, in other ways also, we always love the person who is really opposite to our temperament in every way.\nIt almost always happens that a very intellectual person will fall in love with a woman who is completely non-intellectual. Miller fell in love with Marilyn Monroe. Mm? she was just a cow. She suffered very much because she wanted to be an intellectual. This man, Miller, was a great intellectual and she felt inferior. That created conflict. She tried but she could not do anything because she was really a totally different type – a body type who lives through instincts... and that was her beauty; that was her charm. That’s why Miller had fallen in love with her.\nMiller’s intellect was a great attraction for her, because she always felt that she should have gone to the university, should have great degrees – and she never even went to school, even to high school; she was not even a matriculate.\nSo Miller was a pinnacle of intellect – a great, intelligent person, very argumentative. She had fallen in love with that intellectual and miller had fallen in love with that instinctive, intuitive being.\nBut now there is a problem. They have fallen in love – that’s okay – but they are so different that they never meet anywhere. She lives a very instinctive life, temperamental; in one moment she is angry, in another moment she is loving; in one moment she is ready to kill or to commit suicide. And this is very difficult for an intellectual, because he moves through reason, step by step. His working is that of syllogism and he cannot understand what type of things are happening. This looks nonsense, insane, but that’s why he has fallen in love.\nNow this woman cannot understand what this logic and this mathematics and cleverness is, why there are always calculations and why one should be rational. Why not irrational? What is wrong in being irrational?\nMarilyn Monroe committed suicide. Before she committed suicide she wrote a letter to a friend and in that letter she writes, ‘I could not make it with Miller, and I know that there was no possibility of finding a better man.’ She left – she divorced, she married thrice – but every time it was a failure, because she would always be attracted to something which was against her temperament. The people who would be attracted to her were attracted to the opposite, and then there was conflict.\nNow this is the problem: attraction and conflict come out of the same reason – attraction out of the opposition and conflict out of the opposition. So lovers continue to fight... they remain intimate enemies. That enmity can only be dropped if you really become very understanding.\nSo my suggestion is that this is not your case in particular, this is the case in general. All love affairs, more or less, come to this point – they have to come, because from the very beginning the affair is doomed. The attraction is towards the opposite – how can you avoid the conflict? The conflict is implied in the attraction itself. This is the trouble, it is in-built.\nSo once two lovers have settled, the attraction disappears – because now you have become familiar with each other; the attraction is bound to settle. Now there will not be honeymoon peaks – you will live on a plain ground. Once the attraction settles there are only peaks of conflict. When the honeymoon is there and the peaks of honeymoon are there, the conflict is not apparent. Mm? it is\ndeep in the valleys far away. You can forget about it, you may not even think about it, you may not even dream about it. All honeymoons are beautiful but one cannot live in the honeymoon forever. That will be like flying in the aeroplane, always and always and always.\nYou have to land and settle, because you cannot live on that honeymoon height. The altitude is too high and it is difficult to breathe on that altitude for long. One has to come down and settle – and one has to settle on the earth.\nOnce you settle and the marriage has come to the normal, there will only be peaks of conflict; they are the compensatory peaks. With whomsoever you had the honeymoon you will have these peaks also. That’s why in the east...\nThe east is very cunning and clever – they dropped the whole phenomenon of love completely. Seeing this problem, and the problem is such that it cannot be avoided, the east completely dropped the love affair. Marriage has to be settled – love is not to be allowed. Once love is not allowed there are no honeymoon peaks. If you can destroy the honeymoon peaks there are no conflict peaks. That’s the whole logic of the east – very cunning logic – but then there is no romance left.\nIn fact, the woman and the man who are going to marry are not even to see each other; the parents will settle the whole thing. The whole thing is settled on the plain ground. Their finances have to be reckoned with, the family’s status has to be reckoned with, the health, the health of the last two, three generations of the family – whether somebody has been mad, had cancer, tb, this and that – all these things have to be taken care of. Just one thing has to be left out: love, because that is dangerous.\nSo from the very beginning, in the east, the marriage starts on the plain ground; they don’t allow any peaks. Then there is no conflict either... but that, too, doesn’t seem to be good. It is as if just because of thorns you destroy the roses. Seeing that the thorns always come with the roses, the east has destroyed the roses completely so there are no thorns.\nThe western love affair is more hectic, more dangerous, more maddening, because the west has decided to keep the roses, but then those thorns are there, and sooner or later they hurt.\nSo what has to be done is to first think of it as a general case. I insist on that – to think of it as a general case. Why do I insist? Because once you see something as general, you become more objective. Then it is not something in particular for you. It is not that something has gone wrong between [you both]; [you] are irrelevant. It is something that always goes wrong between every [couple].\nOnce you have seen that this is a general case – degrees may differ but the basic thing does not differ – you have a more objective observation and things can be easily solved. Then you are not personally involved. You have a little distance.\nWhenever things go well, enjoy – whenever they don’t, don’t pay too much attention to them. So whenever you can be in a good mood and together, be together, otherwise be separate... because we are not here to cripple each other. If we cannot make the other happy then it is better that we should not come into the picture at all.\nSo whenever you are both feeling good, happy, meet, commune, love each other, but when you feel that now your temperaments are asserting themselves, there is no point in living together; leave each other alone. That will help much, because when you are left alone there is no point in being angry and sad. And there is no necessity to go through all torture – it is not worth it. What is the point of continuously torturing each other? Then you are some sort of a masochist or sadist; it is ill.\nOnce you understand and she understands that this is the thing – if we can be happy, we have to be together, if we cannot be happy, then we separateOnce that thing is decided, things will change,\nbecause I don’t think that you want to be separate. Once that dagger is there, hanging over you, things will settle.\nAnd don’t try to change each other, because that never, never happens. People go on hoping and waste their whole life. You will try to change her and she will try to change you – that is nonsense! Why bother? If you can love the person as he is, love. If you cannot love the person as he is, leave! If it is difficult to leave, make an arrangement, have an agreement, that whenever you both feel good, invite each other, be together, but the moment that you feel that something is going wrong just say good-bye, be separate.\nSo first start by a provisional arrangement – be together only when you are happy. We should only be with somebody when we are happy, otherwise not. Why? It is better to be happy and separate than to be unhappy and together.\nIf you really love each other you will sacrifice your madness, your anger, for your love. Love needs sacrifice – and we don’t sacrifice anything! We are ready to sacrifice love for other things: for small things you become angry and you never think that you are sacrificing love for it! It is trivia. When you look at it you know that it is foolish. But small things put together, one day destroy the whole love. There are not big things.\nIf you ask a couple, ‘For what things are you fighting?’ they feel shy, awkward – they can’t say exactly what things. They say just ‘such and such’, but to exactly put those things on the list, they feel foolish, stupid, because these things are not worth anything.\nSo let it be very clear that either your love is sacrificed for your small foolishnesses, or your small foolishnesses have to be sacrificed for love. Now it is up to you! If you want to save the love, sacrifice your foolishnesses. Otherwise I don’t see the point of why you should be together. Even if you love, that is not enough excuse to torture.\nThat continuous saying, ‘I love, I love,’ seems to be a trick of the mind, because if you love, really love the person, you would like him or her to be happy. Otherwise what is love for? It should be a blessing, but it doesn’t seem to be a blessing. Out of one hundred, in ninety-nine cases it is a curse. The greatest curse that can happen to a man is love!\nBut the problem is that people cannot live alone. They are not capable of being alone, so they have to be with somebody. They have to settle and accept all sorts of nonsense that grows out of it. Because people cannot stand on their own and they are children and they need somebody to lean on, this whole nonsense continues.\nBut you are both growing, and you both have to take more courageous steps. If there really is love then love wants that everything else should be sacrificed. Make it a deliberate, conscious effort of sacrifice. If you cannot sacrifice those foolish things please don’t say that you love, because then it is meaningless. Only your sacrifice will prove that you love.\nAnd what am I asking that you sacrifice? Anger, hatred, jealousy, this and that – all nonsense! If you cannot sacrifice even these things, then what else can you sacrifice? People say sometimes that they are ready to die for the other, but they cannot drop a little thing like anger... and they are ready to die! It doesn’t seem possible. They are just fooling around with the idea, because who is going to ask you to die?\nSo make it a point: sacrifice all nonsense. And if you cannot, sacrifice love. Be courageous either way.\nFor one month both try to sacrifice all nonsense. And if you cannot, after one month tell me how things are. Then separate. It is not good to destroy each other continuously. Let her be with somebody else – she may be happy – and you may be happy with somebody else. Why destroy both lives?\nBut I don’t see that there is any need to separate. I am making it clear so that you know what you have to sacrifice, so you don’t hope in a wrong direction. I am making the situation completely hopeless so things become clear. For one month both sacrifice for love.\nAnd remember, I am not saying that you have to ask him to sacrifice, or he has to ask you to sacrifice, because that is not sacrifice. You are not to ask him to sacrifice. You are not to say to him, ‘Osho has said – now sacrifice.’ (laughter) That is for him! [He] will do his work – you have to do your work, otherwise you will go home and you will say, ‘Now...!’ (laughter) I’m not saying that!\nAfter one month, come again, then we will see, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says: Every afternoon around two o’clock I feel I need to lie down and all my energy feels very very strong, at a point here (indicating head).I want to die!]\nThat very desire prevents you. That very desire comes from your ego. Who is this ‘I’ who wants to die? That is going to be your last achievement, the last ego-fulfillment – that you want to be egoless. Why ? When the whole world is so full of ego, only chidvilas wants to become egoless. That is very egoistic, isn’t it so? (laughter) When the whole world is so full of ego you have also to be with the ego. Why should you be egoless? When the whole world is ignorant why do you want to be enlightened? There is nothing else to do about it. This is the whole game, the same game: chasing your tail again and again! Now egolessness is the goal. A great spiritual something has to happen to you – you cannot be satisfied. This is greed! Why can’t you accept things as they are?\nNow your whole effort is creating anxiety. Accept – in deep acceptance the mind disappears. Accept the ego and the ego will die, because when you accept there is no point in the ego being alive. How can it be alive? It lives through ambition, it lives through desire. Something has to be achieved: power, prestige, spirituality, nirvana. Something has to be achieved; an object is there.\nThe ego lives through projecting new goals. If you accept that whatsoever is, is, there is no projection and the ego disappears. There is nothing to project – nowhere to go: chidvilas is chidvilas! When one has accepted, one accepts so totally that there is not even a slight effort to be somebody else.\nThis is real transformation – not to desire transformation.\n[The sannyasin says: I see it as being a wall. I would like it to be broken.]\nSo let it be there... let it be the wall! Everybody is facing it. You want something special which is not happening to anybody – that’s the trouble. You want to become a buddha, fast and instant, and that is not happening, so you become very much disturbed. That will never happen – it was not happening even to buddha himself. When he was trying he was in the same mess as you are!\nFor six years he was trying everything – standing on his head, fasting, mantram, kundalini, and chakras – and nothing was happening! He knew that nothing was happening, and he was chasing it like a mad dog. Then one day he recognised the fact that this was the whole ego effort – in a new direction but it was the same game!\nIn that moment of recognition he dropped all projection, all ambition; he rested under the tree. For the first time in millions of lives. he rested... because a mind can rest only when there is no ambition – otherwise, how can you rest? You are after it in the day, you are after it in the night, you are after it awake, you are after it asleep – how can you rest? An ambitious mind knows no rest.\nFor the first time he was really relaxed. There was nowhere to go and there was nothing to do, so how to create restlessness? Everything simply collapsed, all projections dropped, all dreams simply disappeared.\nThat night he slept in absolute stillness, in great restfulness; the relaxation was total. And in the morning when the last star was fading, he opened his eyes – for no reason; there was no motivation now. There was no motivation to even open the eyes.\nEvery other day, every other morning, he was awake with the motivation – now again he has to do this and that and meditate and do austerities and go to this teacher and read that scripture; there was motivation. That morning there was nowhere to go and there was no motivation. Just try to comprehend those eyes without motivation.…\nHe opened the eyes because now the sleep was over – not that there was any motivation to open the eyes; there was no need to close them, that’s all; it was negative. He opened the eyes and with the last star disappearing he became enlightened. The wall you are talking about disappeared, because now there was no motivation.\nThe motivation is the cause of the wall. It is your own motivation that is hindering you! So drop all motivations!\nAnd I am not saying to create a new motivation, because when you are nodding your head, I know why you are nodding! (laughter) I know! I exactly know why you are nodding your head. You are saying, ’Right, bhagwan! So now let this be the motivation! So now I will try! Here is your [sannyasin]\n– I will try! I will try my best to drop all motivation.’ But again you have created a motivation, and you have missed!\nThis is just an understanding – not something to be done... just pure understanding – that motivation is the cause of all suffering. Understanding this, motivations disappear... not that you drop them! Understanding this – that motivation is the cause of all suffering – motivation disappears. It is no more in your being, because your understanding becomes a light and the darkness disappears.\nIt is not that one day you become enlightened, one day you suddenly find that you were always enlightened, but because of this continuous motivation – to do this, to do that, to be this, to be that\n– you were not able to see what you are, what you have always been! You have been missing your reality because of your desires.\nThose desires are creating so much smoke that the flame of your being is lost. When the smoke is not there the flame burns bright, clear and bright, sharp, and then you know who you are. Then there is nothing to do, achieve, nothing to be desired. All is herenow, in your own being.…\nThe problem is very basic, because whenever such things are said your mind immediately translates them into the language of desire, and again you miss! So again and again you will bring the same problem and again and again I will explain to you, hoping that one day your mind will be tired of translating it and you will be able to listen directly.\nI was reading the diary of an old indian man. He is ninety years old and still alive. He was a small raja – Raja Mohendra Pratap Singh – and a very great revolutionary.\nHe is very old, so he has been in contact with all sorts of people – lenin, stalin, mao and ho chi minh\n– all the revolutionaries of the world. He has been travelling continuously... a very eccentric man.\nI was reading in his diary that when he went to see lenin, the translator – the person who was translating – later on told him, ‘Whenever you said “religion” I translated it as “communism”.’ He said, ‘What nonsense! But that makes the whole thing absolutely wrong!’\nBut the man said, ‘That’s what translators are ordered to do in russia. If somebody says “religion” we have to translate that as “communism”!’ (laughter)\nSo when his talk was translated and people were clapping, then he knew later on (with a chuckle) why they were clapping! – because he was praising religion and they were hearing communism being praised. He was saying that man cannot live without religion and the translator was saying that man cannot live without communism, and people were clapping!\nBut the translator said, ‘Only one word I have changed – nothing else! (laughter) And that much you have to allow, because communism is our religion,’ he said. ‘So we are not doing anything wrong; commun-ism is our religion and marx is our prophet.’\nThis is how things go when you translate – and your mind continuously translates everything. It immediately turns into a desire; that is the basic trick of the mind. Talk about desirelessness and the mind says, ‘Okay, now we will have to create this desirelessness, so I will desire desirelessness.’ Tell\nsomebody, ‘Don’t think and in a state of no-thinking meditation will happen,’ and he will say, ‘Okay, I will try not to think.’ And now he continuously thinks not to think, that’s all! It is a very vicious circle.\nSo just watch it, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says: I have been alone or on my own now for ten days or so... I felt so incomplete or I saw myself as incomplete, and always needing somebody else to comfort me. I just saw that.]\nBut what is wrong in being incomplete? And what is wrong in being in relationship just to be completed by somebody else? That’s how things are. As far as the body is concerned we are incomplete. As far as the mind is concerned we are incomplete – not as much as the body, but we are still incomplete. The mind can exist alone more easily than the body. As far as the innermost being is concerned, the self is concerned, we are not as incomplete as the mind – very little, just a little incomplete... ninety-nine percent complete, only one percent missing.\nThe deeper you go, the more complete and more independent you will become. As the body, one is incomplete – a man is a man, the woman is a woman; the woman needs the man, the man needs the woman. Every day food is needed otherwise one will die. Water is needed, air is needed. One can live without food for three months but one cannot live without air for more than eight minutes. We are incomplete at the level of the body. The mind is a little more independent but not very much, because the mind is still divided into man and woman. And the mind also depends on the body and through the body depends on everything else that the body depends on.\nBeyond the mind and body is your soul – that is far more independent But that too depends on god. So there comes a moment in the innermost core when you are no more, only god is; then only independence is. Only god is independent,\nSufis say, ‘Only god has the right to say, “I”.’ Everybody else is just pretending to be an ‘I’ but is not, because everybody is just a fragment. Only the whole can say ‘I’, because the whole has the centre.\nI can understand your problem, but accept that all these levels are your levels. Your body is yours, your mind is yours. Accept them, and by and by understanding will arise through more experience.\nYou will become independent one day but that independence will happen at the very core of your being. And right now there is no hurry... because these things are also needed: experience of love is needed – it helps. The misery that comes through love is needed – it helps. Good and bad, all that happens, is needed; sadness, happiness, is needed. They are all climates. In these climates one becomes more and more seasoned, and one day one becomes really independent; then nothing is needed. But don’t be in a hurry, because nothing happens in a hurry. One has to go very slow-ly, very patiently.\nSo even if you want to hurry, hurry very slowly! (laughter) It will change – nothing is to be worried about. But accept every level of your being, don’t reject anything.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6890","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/>What Is, Is, What Ain\'t, Ain\'t</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6890 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/What_Is_Is_What_Aint_Aint/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
<a href=part3>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark1>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>2</span></p><p><br></p><p>2 February 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>[The Enlightenment Intensive group is present. One member says: At
first I didn’t like it, bu the second half of the group I liked very
much.]</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember that even if you don’t like a certain thing, it is
not necessarily bad. Liking and disliking makes no difference. Sometimes
the thing that you like may be harmful, and vice versa: the thing that
you don’t like at all may prove a great transformation. In fact that is
more likely.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing that you don’t like is more likely to help you, because
liking comes out of the past, liking comes out of your mind. The mind
likes that which hts with it, and anything that fits with the mind is
never going to change you. Anything whatsoever that fits with the mind
will strengthen the same mind, will make it even stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>So something that the mind feels repelled by has to be explored.
There is a possibility that it may prove a radical change in your life.
And right now you misunderstand because you are identified too much with
the mind. You don’t know what is really beneficial and what is not.
Whatsoever you decide, you decide through the mind. You don’t know yet
how to look at things without the mind interfering.</p><p><br></p><p>Now for example, this: if you had listened to the mind, the mind was
telling you, ‘Leave! It is pointless, and why are you wasting your time?
I don’t like it!’ That mind tries to say that you don’t like it, and you
are so identified that you don’t make the distinction that this is the
mind saying, ‘I don’t like it.’ But the mind’s liking or disliking is
not your liking or disliking. You are separate from the mind, different
from the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So sometimes try that which the mind does not like, and sometimes
don’t try that to which the mind feels attracted and likes. Go on
playing with this game. By and by the mind and you become loose,</p><p>and then you have a tremendously new perspective. Then sometimes it
happens that you can see a thing without the mind coming in, because now
you are loose, not so tightly attached to each other.</p><p>This loosening comes only when you sometimes go on trying the thing
that the mind does not like, and sometimes not trying the thing that the
mind likes.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to use this technique very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody would come who was a vegetarian and who was absolutely
against meat-eating and non-vegetarian food. Gurdjieff would force him
to eat non-vegetarian food. Now it was repelling – to a person who has
never touched meat and to a person who has always preached vegetarianism
there cannot be anything more repulsive. Suddenly this man says, ‘Eat
meat, otherwise I don’t allow you here... otherwise leave me!’</p><p>Now he had to choose between Gurdjieff and vegetarianism – and that
is too much! When you have come in close proximity to a person like
gurdjieff it becomes very difficult not to choose him. To eat meat is
nauseating for a person who has always been against it, but gurdjieff
would force him.</p><p>Sometimes, to a meat-eater, Gurdjieff would say, ‘Stop meat-eating
completely. Become vegetarian.’ For somebody who never drank he would go
on forcing him to drink more and more till he was completely lost. To
somebody who drank he would tell them to stop it. That was a way of
loosening the mind from the person.</p><p>To somebody who hated manual work Gurdjieff would give manual work.
He had a great insight into finding what people hated – and he would
immediately find out what it was<span class=s4></span>And sometimes
very</p><p>surprisingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days before, I was reading a memoir.… A doctor –
Gurdjieff’s doctor, his own private physician – has written in his
memoirs that the first time he came in contact with Gurdjieff the thing
that impressed him was his tremendous insight.</p><p>A woman had come with this doctor to Gurdjieff for the first time.
Gurdjieff used to see people only at the dining table every evening –
thirty, forty, sometimes fifty and sometimes one hundred people in a
small room, crowded. This woman had come with the doctor for the first
time – a young beautiful woman – and she was sitting by the side of a
very old woman.<span class=s4></span>must have been like our
bhakti</p><p>(italian and elderly, she is an ashramite), white-haired.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to prepare plates, and he would say to whom a plate
should go. He prepared a plate and said, ‘It goes to the mum.’ So the
people who took the plate thought he was indicating the old woman –
naturally, because she was the oldest woman there and he had said, ‘This
goes to the mum.’</p><p>But when the disciple took the plate to the old woman, Gurdjieff
said, ‘No, the other one.’ The young woman was by the side of the old
woman and nobody could believe why he was calling her ‘mum’. That young
woman started crying! The doctor was also puzzled.</p><p>Only later on did he come to know that that woman was really a mum –
she was a mother to her children, she was a mother to her husband too!
She was mothering everybody... she was even mothering her own father.
Her whole life was concentrated on that point.</p><p>Gurdjieff had an insight into where people were. In fact a master can
work only when he has that insight, otherwise there is no work possible.
And he will immediately bring out the thing that you don’t like. The
woman started crying because that was the one thing she never liked to
be told. Mm? that was one thing that used to hurt her very much. She
knew it – it was like a wound. She had come for the first time and this
man had caught hold of her!</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff would always give just the opposite. To somebody who likes
physical exercise very much, goes for a morning walk, evening walk,
horse-riding, this and that, Gurdjieff would say to just sit silently
and not to do anything. He would feel restless and would boil
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the way the mind and you become loose.</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t listen to the mind, a distance arises. So learn this
one thing from this experience – don’t decide in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you don’t like a woman and she may prove the best
companion. Sometimes you like the woman at the first sight – you ‘fall
in love’ as it is said – and she may prove the worst enemy to you.
That’s how it is happening all over the world: people fall in love at
first sight and then they suffer their whole life. Because this is
decided by the mind... and the mind is blind!</p><p><br></p><p>The mind has no awareness. Awareness is a totally different thing,
far away from mind, and awareness becomes available only when the mind
is no more making its chattering, its noise, so you can hear the still,
small voice, from somewhere beyond the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep it as a key, and sometimes go on trying something against the
mind. Enjoy it, and you will be benefited tremendously.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asks: I feel a little confused about what I call the
will and surrender. It is something very difficult for me to find the
right attitude towards surrendering.]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t make a problem out of it. Surrendering is really nothing
against the will. The moment you start thinking that surrendering is
against the will, it looks like a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Surrendering is not against the will at all – in fact it is a
flowering of the will, it is the culmination of the will. Only a person
who has tremendous will can surrender. A weak person cannot surrender. A
weak person may say that he has surrendered, but he has nothing to
surrender. He is hiding his impotence behind a beautiful word –
surrender is a beautiful word, and you can hide behind it. But he has
nothing to surrender! What will you surrender if you don’t have the
will?</p><p><br></p><p>So to me, surrender and will are not opposites. Surrender is the
final crescendo. So nothing to be worried about. With me, opposites are
not opposites but complementaries – that has to be always remembered.
Whenever you are creating some division and thinking in terms of
opposites, always remember that my insistence is that there are no
opposites, everything is complementary. It is only great will that makes
it possible for surrender to happen. They are not against each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t create any conflict and don’t start thinking, ‘What is my
way: will or surrender?’ Wherever you are and whatsoever you are, learn
to accept it. If there is will, good – you have to grow your will.</p><p>One day when a grown-up will is there, a mature will is there, you
will see – now the ripe will wants to fall like a ripe fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Only unripe fruits resist – a ripe fruit simply falls of its own
accord. When a real man of will comes to me he immediately surrenders.
There is no problem about it... he does not hesitate at all. But when
the will is not ripe, then the hesitation... natural hesitation. And
there is nothing wrong in it – it Simply shows that you need a little
more mature will. So wherever you are, go on moving in the same
direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not interested in changing your directions and I don’t want to
give you something towards which you were not growing on your own – no,
not at all! Whatsoever your goal, wherever your natural movement, I help
it that way. If you find that will is the thing that goes naturally with
you, go into it deeply, go totally. Then that is your discipline and
that is my teaching for you. Go into it as deeply.… Get in tune with
your will. And one day you will find that now the fruit is ripe and the
fruit wants to fall to the earth. The ripe will, of its own accord,
changes its quality and be-comes surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>And this has to be the basic key for all opposites in every path
wherever people divide. Somebody comes and says, ‘What is my path –
reason or love?’ Unless you have a very grown-up reason you will not be
able to fall into love. You will always be afraid, hesitant, reluctant;
you will go only so far, because the reason will not be able to decide
totally. Only a very mature reason can decide totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody comes and asks, ‘What is my right attitude: belief or faith?
Reason or faith? Action or inaction? Feminine or masculine? Yin or
yang?’ And my approach is the same: that wherever you are finding
yourself naturally, go in the same direction. If you can go into the
same direction far enough, you will turn in the other direction
automatically – because it is a wheel and everything turns into its
opposite. That’s the whole secret of life. The day turns into night, the
night turns into day.…</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to be worried about what to choose – day
automatically turns into night and night automatically turns into day;
life turns into death, and death turns into life again. That’s how it
moves, one has simply to accept!</p><p><br></p><p>The buddhists have the right word for it – ‘tathata’; one has to
accept the suchness of things. Whatsoever is, is – accept it, and don’t
hanker for the opposite. Go headlong into it, to the farthest end of it,
and suddenly you will see that it has turned into its polar opposite...
a miracle. And then you know that life is one.</p><p><br></p><p>Will and surrender are two polarities of one energy, like negative
and positive electricity. The positive electricity cannot exist without
the negative – neither can the negative exist without the positive.</p><p><br></p><p>So will and surrender both exist in your being and both exist
together. But will is more primary, so one has to go through the will.
Surrender is more ultimate, so one has to go into surrender one day...
but there is no need to force it, there is no need to cultivate it,
because all that is cultivated is false. Only the natural, the
spontaneous, that which comes on its own, is beautiful and true!</p><p><br></p><p>So simply accept your being, whatsoever, wheresoever it is – accept
it totally. Let its suchness be welcomed – that this is where you are,
this is how you are. You cannot be anywhere else and you</p><p>cannot be anybody else. This is the way you are and this is the only
way you are. This is the only way you can be in this moment. I am not
talking about other moments, you will change, but in this moment this is
the only way you can be. So why create anxiety ? Why become divided,
split?</p><p><br></p><p>Live the moment! Live the suchness of it and live it totally. And out
of this lived moment, out of this lived suchness, the other will come –
it will arise on its own. And when it comes on its own it is
tremendously beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Surrender will come, but that is the flowering. Will is like the seed
and surrender is like the flower. Wait... nothing to be worried about.
It is on the way, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyas couple ask about their relationship. The woman had had a
car accident which caused many changes in her. The man said they had
opposite temperaments; he felt blocked in expressing love.]</p><p><br></p><p>I understand. It is something very fundamental to be understood.
First, we are always attracted towards the opposite person, the opposite
type. People fall in love with the opposite type, because if you are in
love with somebody who is just like you, you will feel as if you are in
love with your twin – and that will be monotonous. It will be as if you
are in love with your own picture, with your own mirror-reflection.</p><p><br></p><p>Only very egoistic persons fall in love with the same type of person
– very very egoistic people... narcissistic. They fall in love with a
person who is just like them, a carbon copy. But then they have other
problems, their ego creates the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t allow the other any freedom whatsoever, because any
freedom seems to be a betrayal. The other has to be just a replica,
exact and precise. The other should not be allowed nay individuality. If
the other asserts any individuality there is conflict – and how can the
other be just a replica? Then there is pretension, hypocrisy. People
wear masks and pretend, but then love disappears; love is not
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>In that way there is a problem, because the person is only in love
with his own ego and he wants the other to fit exactly with his ego –
that’s not possible. Either the other is killed – then there is a dead
person, and you cannot love a dead person.<span class=s4></span>And if
the other is alive you cannot love, because you</p><p>want him to be just a replica, just a copy to your being; so you are
asking the impossible. Either way there is frustration. But this happens
in only one percent of cases.</p><p><br></p><p>In ninety-nine percent of cases the other type of problem arises – we
fall in love with the opposite type of person. In fact that is real
heterosexuality. It is not only a question of a man falling in love with
a woman; it is really two polarities falling in love with each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am not in favour of homosexual tendencies – because they
are egoistic. You are falling in love with somebody who is just like you
– a man or a woman: a woman falling in love with a woman or a man
falling in love with a man. That is very egoistic and juvenile,
immature.</p><p><br></p><p>Heterosexuality brings another type of problem, because it brings
great challenges. The first challenge is that the other is other – you
are a man and she is a woman – and from there</p><p>temperaments are different. And not only that, in other ways also, we
always love the person who is really opposite to our temperament in
every way.</p><p><br></p><p>It almost always happens that a very intellectual person will fall in
love with a woman who is completely non-intellectual. Miller fell in
love with Marilyn Monroe. Mm? she was just a cow. She suffered very much
because she wanted to be an intellectual. This man, Miller, was a great
intellectual and she felt inferior. That created conflict. She tried but
she could not do anything because she was really a totally different
type – a body type who lives through instincts... and that was her
beauty; that was her charm. That’s why Miller had fallen in love with
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Miller’s intellect was a great attraction for her, because she always
felt that she should have gone to the university, should have great
degrees – and she never even went to school, even to high school; she
was not even a matriculate.</p><p><br></p><p>So Miller was a pinnacle of intellect – a great, intelligent person,
very argumentative. She had fallen in love with that intellectual and
miller had fallen in love with that instinctive, intuitive being.</p><p><br></p><p>But now there is a problem. They have fallen in love – that’s okay –
but they are so different that they never meet anywhere. She lives a
very instinctive life, temperamental; in one moment she is angry, in
another moment she is loving; in one moment she is ready to kill or to
commit suicide. And this is very difficult for an intellectual, because
he moves through reason, step by step. His working is that of syllogism
and he cannot understand what type of things are happening. This looks
nonsense, insane, but that’s why he has fallen in love.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this woman cannot understand what this logic and this mathematics
and cleverness is, why there are always calculations and why one should
be rational. Why not irrational? What is wrong in being irrational?</p><p><br></p><p>Marilyn Monroe committed suicide. Before she committed suicide she
wrote a letter to a friend and in that letter she writes, ‘I could not
make it with Miller, and I know that there was no possibility of finding
a better man.’ She left – she divorced, she married thrice – but every
time it was a failure, because she would always be attracted to
something which was against her temperament. The people who would be
attracted to her were attracted to the opposite, and then there was
conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is the problem: attraction and conflict come out of the same
reason – attraction out of the opposition and conflict out of the
opposition. So lovers continue to fight... they remain intimate enemies.
That enmity can only be dropped if you really become very
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>So my suggestion is that this is not your case in particular, this is
the case in general. All love affairs, more or less, come to this point
– they have to come, because from the very beginning the affair is
doomed. The attraction is towards the opposite – how can you avoid the
conflict? The conflict is implied in the attraction itself. This is the
trouble, it is in-built.</p><p><br></p><p>So once two lovers have settled, the attraction disappears – because
now you have become familiar with each other; the attraction is bound to
settle. Now there will not be honeymoon peaks – you will live on a plain
ground. Once the attraction settles there are only peaks of conflict.
When the honeymoon is there and the peaks of honeymoon are there, the
conflict is not apparent. Mm? it is</p><p>deep in the valleys far away. You can forget about it, you may not
even think about it, you may not even dream about it. All honeymoons are
beautiful but one cannot live in the honeymoon forever. That will be
like flying in the aeroplane, always and always and always.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to land and settle, because you cannot live on that
honeymoon height. The altitude is too high and it is difficult to
breathe on that altitude for long. One has to come down and settle – and
one has to settle on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you settle and the marriage has come to the normal, there will
only be peaks of conflict; they are the compensatory peaks. With
whomsoever you had the honeymoon you will have these peaks also. That’s
why in the east...</p><p><br></p><p>The east is very cunning and clever – they dropped the whole
phenomenon of love completely. Seeing this problem, and the problem is
such that it cannot be avoided, the east completely dropped the love
affair. Marriage has to be settled – love is not to be allowed. Once
love is not allowed there are no honeymoon peaks. If you can destroy the
honeymoon peaks there are no conflict peaks. That’s the whole logic of
the east – very cunning logic – but then there is no romance left.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the woman and the man who are going to marry are not even to
see each other; the parents will settle the whole thing. The whole thing
is settled on the plain ground. Their finances have to be reckoned with,
the family’s status has to be reckoned with, the health, the health of
the last two, three generations of the family – whether somebody has
been mad, had cancer, tb, this and that – all these things have to be
taken care of. Just one thing has to be left out: love, because that is
dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>So from the very beginning, in the east, the marriage starts on the
plain ground; they don’t allow any peaks. Then there is no conflict
either... but that, too, doesn’t seem to be good. It is as if just
because of thorns you destroy the roses. Seeing that the thorns always
come with the roses, the east has destroyed the roses completely so
there are no thorns.</p><p><br></p><p>The western love affair is more hectic, more dangerous, more
maddening, because the west has decided to keep the roses, but then
those thorns are there, and sooner or later they hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>So what has to be done is to first think of it as a general case. I
insist on that – to think of it as a general case. Why do I insist?
Because once you see something as general, you become more objective.
Then it is not something in particular for you. It is not that something
has gone wrong between [you both]; [you] are irrelevant. It is something
that always goes wrong between every [couple].</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have seen that this is a general case – degrees may differ
but the basic thing does not differ – you have a more objective
observation and things can be easily solved. Then you are not personally
involved. You have a little distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever things go well, enjoy – whenever they don’t, don’t pay too
much attention to them. So whenever you can be in a good mood and
together, be together, otherwise be separate... because we are not here
to cripple each other. If we cannot make the other happy then it is
better that we should not come into the picture at all.</p><p>So whenever you are both feeling good, happy, meet, commune, love
each other, but when you feel that now your temperaments are asserting
themselves, there is no point in living together; leave each other
alone. That will help much, because when you are left alone there is no
point in being angry and sad. And there is no necessity to go through
all torture – it is not worth it. What is the point of continuously
torturing each other? Then you are some sort of a masochist or sadist;
it is ill.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand and she understands that this is the thing – if
we can be happy, we have to be together, if we cannot be happy, then we
separate<span class=s4></span>Once that thing is decided, things will
change,</p><p>because I don’t think that you want to be separate. Once that dagger
is there, hanging over you, things will settle.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t try to change each other, because that never, never
happens. People go on hoping and waste their whole life. You will try to
change her and she will try to change you – that is nonsense! Why
bother? If you can love the person as he is, love. If you cannot love
the person as he is, leave! If it is difficult to leave, make an
arrangement, have an agreement, that whenever you both feel good, invite
each other, be together, but the moment that you feel that something is
going wrong just say good-bye, be separate.</p><p><br></p><p>So first start by a provisional arrangement – be together only when
you are happy. We should only be with somebody when we are happy,
otherwise not. Why? It is better to be happy and separate than to be
unhappy and together.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really love each other you will sacrifice your madness, your
anger, for your love. Love needs sacrifice – and we don’t sacrifice
anything! We are ready to sacrifice love for other things: for small
things you become angry and you never think that you are sacrificing
love for it! It is trivia. When you look at it you know that it is
foolish. But small things put together, one day destroy the whole love.
There are not big things.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask a couple, ‘For what things are you fighting?’ they feel
shy, awkward – they can’t say exactly what things. They say just ‘such
and such’, but to exactly put those things on the list, they feel
foolish, stupid, because these things are not worth anything.</p><p><br></p><p>So let it be very clear that either your love is sacrificed for your
small foolishnesses, or your small foolishnesses have to be sacrificed
for love. Now it is up to you! If you want to save the love, sacrifice
your foolishnesses. Otherwise I don’t see the point of why you should be
together. Even if you love, that is not enough excuse to torture.</p><p><br></p><p>That continuous saying, ‘I love, I love,’ seems to be a trick of the
mind, because if you love, really love the person, you would like him or
her to be happy. Otherwise what is love for? It should be a blessing,
but it doesn’t seem to be a blessing. Out of one hundred, in ninety-nine
cases it is a curse. The greatest curse that can happen to a man is
love!</p><p><br></p><p>But the problem is that people cannot live alone. They are not
capable of being alone, so they have to be with somebody. They have to
settle and accept all sorts of nonsense that grows out of it. Because
people cannot stand on their own and they are children and they need
somebody to lean on, this whole nonsense continues.</p><p>But you are both growing, and you both have to take more courageous
steps. If there really is love then love wants that everything else
should be sacrificed. Make it a deliberate, conscious effort of
sacrifice. If you cannot sacrifice those foolish things please don’t say
that you love, because then it is meaningless. Only your sacrifice will
prove that you love.</p><p><br></p><p>And what am I asking that you sacrifice? Anger, hatred, jealousy,
this and that – all nonsense! If you cannot sacrifice even these things,
then what else can you sacrifice? People say sometimes that they are
ready to die for the other, but they cannot drop a little thing like
anger... and they are ready to die! It doesn’t seem possible. They are
just fooling around with the idea, because who is going to ask you to
die?</p><p><br></p><p>So make it a point: sacrifice all nonsense. And if you cannot,
sacrifice love. Be courageous either way.</p><p><br></p><p>For one month both try to sacrifice all nonsense. And if you cannot,
after one month tell me how things are. Then separate. It is not good to
destroy each other continuously. Let her be with somebody else – she may
be happy – and you may be happy with somebody else. Why destroy both
lives?</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t see that there is any need to separate. I am making it
clear so that you know what you have to sacrifice, so you don’t hope in
a wrong direction. I am making the situation completely hopeless so
things become clear. For one month both sacrifice for love.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, I am not saying that you have to ask him to sacrifice,
or he has to ask you to sacrifice, because that is not sacrifice. You
are not to ask him to sacrifice. You are not to say to him, ‘Osho has
said – now sacrifice.’ (laughter) That is for him! [He] will do his work
– you have to do your work, otherwise you will go home and you will say,
‘Now...!’ (laughter) I’m not saying that!</p><p><br></p><p>After one month, come again, then we will see, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Every afternoon around two o’clock I feel I need
to lie down and all my energy feels very very strong, at a point here
(indicating head).<span class=s4></span>I want to die!]</p><p><br></p><p>That very desire prevents you. That very desire comes from your ego.
Who is this ‘I’ who wants to die? That is going to be your last
achievement, the last ego-fulfillment – that you want to be egoless. Why
? When the whole world is so full of ego, only chidvilas wants to become
egoless. That is very egoistic, isn’t it so? (laughter) When the whole
world is so full of ego you have also to be with the ego. Why should you
be egoless? When the whole world is ignorant why do you want to be
enlightened? There is nothing else to do about it. This is the whole
game, the same game: chasing your tail again and again! Now egolessness
is the goal. A great spiritual something has to happen to you – you
cannot be satisfied. This is greed! Why can’t you accept things as they
are?</p><p><br></p><p>Now your whole effort is creating anxiety. Accept – in deep
acceptance the mind disappears. Accept the ego and the ego will die,
because when you accept there is no point in the ego being alive. How
can it be alive? It lives through ambition, it lives through desire.
Something has to be achieved: power, prestige, spirituality, nirvana.
Something has to be achieved; an object is there.</p><p>The ego lives through projecting new goals. If you accept that
whatsoever is, is, there is no projection and the ego disappears. There
is nothing to project – nowhere to go: chidvilas is chidvilas! When one
has accepted, one accepts so totally that there is not even a slight
effort to be somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>This is real transformation – not to desire transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says: I see it as being a wall. I would like it to be
broken.]</p><p><br></p><p>So let it be there... let it be the wall! Everybody is facing it. You
want something special which is not happening to anybody – that’s the
trouble. You want to become a buddha, fast and instant, and that is not
happening, so you become very much disturbed. That will never happen –
it was not happening even to buddha himself. When he was trying he was
in the same mess as you are!</p><p><br></p><p>For six years he was trying everything – standing on his head,
fasting, mantram, kundalini, and chakras – and nothing was happening! He
knew that nothing was happening, and he was chasing it like a mad dog.
Then one day he recognised the fact that this was the whole ego effort –
in a new direction but it was the same game!</p><p><br></p><p>In that moment of recognition he dropped all projection, all
ambition; he rested under the tree. For the first time in millions of
lives. he rested... because a mind can rest only when there is no
ambition – otherwise, how can you rest? You are after it in the day, you
are after it in the night, you are after it awake, you are after it
asleep – how can you rest? An ambitious mind knows no rest.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time he was really relaxed. There was nowhere to go and
there was nothing to do, so how to create restlessness? Everything
simply collapsed, all projections dropped, all dreams simply
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>That night he slept in absolute stillness, in great restfulness; the
relaxation was total. And in the morning when the last star was fading,
he opened his eyes – for no reason; there was no motivation now. There
was no motivation to even open the eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Every other day, every other morning, he was awake with the
motivation – now again he has to do this and that and meditate and do
austerities and go to this teacher and read that scripture; there was
motivation. That morning there was nowhere to go and there was no
motivation. Just try to comprehend those eyes without motivation.…</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the eyes because now the sleep was over – not that there
was any motivation to open the eyes; there was no need to close them,
that’s all; it was negative. He opened the eyes and with the last star
disappearing he became enlightened. The wall you are talking about
disappeared, because now there was no motivation.</p><p><br></p><p>The motivation is the cause of the wall. It is your own motivation
that is hindering you! So drop all motivations!</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying to create a new motivation, because when you are
nodding your head, I know why you are nodding! (laughter) I know! I
exactly know why you are nodding your head. You are saying, ’Right,
bhagwan! So now let this be the motivation! So now I will try! Here is
your [sannyasin]</p><p>– I will try! I will try my best to drop all motivation.’ But again
you have created a motivation, and you have missed!</p><p><br></p><p>This is just an understanding – not something to be done... just pure
understanding – that motivation is the cause of all suffering.
Understanding this, motivations disappear... not that you drop them!
Understanding this – that motivation is the cause of all suffering –
motivation disappears. It is no more in your being, because your
understanding becomes a light and the darkness disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that one day you become enlightened, one day you suddenly
find that you were always enlightened, but because of this continuous
motivation – to do this, to do that, to be this, to be that</p><p>– you were not able to see what you are, what you have always been!
You have been missing your reality because of your desires.</p><p><br></p><p>Those desires are creating so much smoke that the flame of your being
is lost. When the smoke is not there the flame burns bright, clear and
bright, sharp, and then you know who you are. Then there is nothing to
do, achieve, nothing to be desired. All is herenow, in your own
being.…</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is very basic, because whenever such things are said your
mind immediately translates them into the language of desire, and again
you miss! So again and again you will bring the same problem and again
and again I will explain to you, hoping that one day your mind will be
tired of translating it and you will be able to listen directly.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading the diary of an old indian man. He is ninety years old
and still alive. He was a small raja – Raja Mohendra Pratap Singh – and
a very great revolutionary.</p><p><br></p><p>He is very old, so he has been in contact with all sorts of people –
lenin, stalin, mao and ho chi minh</p><p>– all the revolutionaries of the world. He has been travelling
continuously... a very eccentric man.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading in his diary that when he went to see lenin, the
translator – the person who was translating – later on told him,
‘Whenever you said “religion” I translated it as “communism”.’ He said,
‘What nonsense! But that makes the whole thing absolutely wrong!’</p><p><br></p><p>But the man said, ‘That’s what translators are ordered to do in
russia. If somebody says “religion” we have to translate that as
“communism”!’ (laughter)</p><p><br></p><p>So when his talk was translated and people were clapping, then he
knew later on (with a chuckle) why they were clapping! – because he was
praising religion and they were hearing communism being praised. He was
saying that man cannot live without religion and the translator was
saying that man cannot live without communism, and people were
clapping!</p><p><br></p><p>But the translator said, ‘Only one word I have changed – nothing
else! (laughter) And that much you have to allow, because communism is
our religion,’ he said. ‘So we are not doing anything wrong; commun-ism
is our religion and marx is our prophet.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is how things go when you translate – and your mind continuously
translates everything. It immediately turns into a desire; that is the
basic trick of the mind. Talk about desirelessness and the mind says,
‘Okay, now we will have to create this desirelessness, so I will desire
desirelessness.’ Tell</p><p>somebody, ‘Don’t think and in a state of no-thinking meditation will
happen,’ and he will say, ‘Okay, I will try not to think.’ And now he
continuously thinks not to think, that’s all! It is a very vicious
circle.</p><p><br></p><p>So just watch it, mm? Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I have been alone or on my own now for ten days or
so... I felt so incomplete or I saw myself as incomplete, and always
needing somebody else to comfort me. I just saw that.]</p><p><br></p><p>But what is wrong in being incomplete? And what is wrong in being in
relationship just to be completed by somebody else? That’s how things
are. As far as the body is concerned we are incomplete. As far as the
mind is concerned we are incomplete – not as much as the body, but we
are still incomplete. The mind can exist alone more easily than the
body. As far as the innermost being is concerned, the self is concerned,
we are not as incomplete as the mind – very little, just a little
incomplete... ninety-nine percent complete, only one percent
missing.</p><p><br></p><p>The deeper you go, the more complete and more independent you will
become. As the body, one is incomplete – a man is a man, the woman is a
woman; the woman needs the man, the man needs the woman. Every day food
is needed otherwise one will die. Water is needed, air is needed. One
can live without food for three months but one cannot live without air
for more than eight minutes. We are incomplete at the level of the body.
The mind is a little more independent but not very much, because the
mind is still divided into man and woman. And the mind also depends on
the body and through the body depends on everything else that the body
depends on.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the mind and body is your soul – that is far more independent
But that too depends on god. So there comes a moment in the innermost
core when you are no more, only god is; then only independence is. Only
god is independent,</p><p><br></p><p>Sufis say, ‘Only god has the right to say, “I”.’ Everybody else is
just pretending to be an ‘I’ but is not, because everybody is just a
fragment. Only the whole can say ‘I’, because the whole has the
centre.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand your problem, but accept that all these levels are
your levels. Your body is yours, your mind is yours. Accept them, and by
and by understanding will arise through more experience.</p><p><br></p><p>You will become independent one day but that independence will happen
at the very core of your being. And right now there is no hurry...
because these things are also needed: experience of love is needed – it
helps. The misery that comes through love is needed – it helps. Good and
bad, all that happens, is needed; sadness, happiness, is needed. They
are all climates. In these climates one becomes more and more seasoned,
and one day one becomes really independent; then nothing is needed. But
don’t be in a hurry, because nothing happens in a hurry. One has to go
very slow-ly, very patiently.</p><p><br></p><p>So even if you want to hurry, hurry very slowly! (laughter) It will
change – nothing is to be worried about. But accept every level of your
being, don’t reject anything.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Deva means divine, god, avesha means possessed by – possessed by god... and from now onwards I will possess you!
So relax and be possessed! Don’t fight with me, because that is sheer wastage of energy. If you remain in a let-go, much is going to happen. If you allow me, nothing is impossible, but the whole thing depends on your allowing me; that is the very core of it."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part27/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part27/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="27"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents

Don’t fight with me, because that is sheer wastage of energy. If you remain in a let-go, much is going to happen. If you allow me, nothing is impossible, but the whole thing depends on your allowing me; that is the very core of it. And it is difficult... not impossible but difficult certainly.\nWe have been taught to fight, to struggle, to have our own way, to have our own will. We have been taught to be egoists – and that ego has to be dropped; only then do you allow. When you are not, you allow me – when you are, you cannot allow.\nSo from this moment, be a nobody... almost a nothingness, empty. Empty yourself of your will and suddenly you will see that things that you were trying for and wanting and desiring and which were never happening, have started to happen on their own accord.\nGod is available if you don’t fight. God is a gift – if you fight, you miss the gift. How can you get a gift when you fight? The gift has to be received, not snatched.\nThat is the meaning of the word ‘avesha’. It means to become receptive and let god possess you. Let him move you wherever he wants... Let him do things through you. Just be a vehicle, a passage, and soon you will start feeling that a new energy is coming into you which is not yours .\nThe distinction is so clear because the energy is so pure – you cannot believe it is yours; it cannot be of you. It is so beautiful, so tremendously powerful, and it is so inexhaustible that it cannot be yours. It is almost as if an ocean has fallen into a drop – it is so vast!\nAnd that is the life I call religious: when a man lives possessed by god. [To a new initiate Osho says:]\nCome here.… Raise your hands this way (above the head) and close your eyes. If something happens in the body, allow it. If your breathing changes, allow it; if your body starts swaying, moving, allow it.\nJust be totally uncontrolled so I can feel where the energy is and where it is going and where exactly it wants to go... go into it.\nCome here...! You have been coming to me for many lives – now you have arrived! This will be your name: Swami Anand Anubodha.\nAnand means bliss, the ultimate state of human consciousness. Literally it means absolute happiness... but with a difference. When you are happy, happiness is something apart from you, something external to you – it has happened to you but you are not it. That is the difference between happiness and anand. Anand is happiness but not separate from you – it is you\nAnd the second word is ‘anubodha’; it means recollection, remembering... that has to be also understood. Anand is not only the ultimate state – it is also the source. It is not only the end but the beginning too – alpha and omega both. And naturally it has to be so. Only that which has always been in the beginning can be the end.\nThe tree unfolds out of a seed because it was there potentially. If it was not there from the very beginning there would have been no possibility for it to happen. So the seed and the tree are not really different – the difference is only of expression. The tree is the expressed seed – the seed is the unexpressed tree. The seed is the potential tree and the tree is the actual seed, the actualised seed; the potentiality has become unfolded, manifest.\nSo this ultimate state of bliss is nothing new – it is a recollection... it is a rediscovery.\nThat’s why we are in search. How can you be in search for a new thing? It is impossible to seek and search for a new thing. Unless somewhere in some way you are already acquainted with it, unless somewhere in some way you have already tasted it, how can you seek it?\nThe absolutely new cannot be sought; there is no way even to desire it – because how can you desire the unknown?\nEverybody is seeking bliss – that means that everybody has known it somewhere. Maybe one has forgotten the path, forgotten the key, forgotten how to reach it – but one had been there once, otherwise how should one seek for it? How can you seek it?\nSome taste still lingers somewhere in your unconscious. Something goes on saying to you, ‘Attain to that again. Unless that is attained, nothing will he fulfilled. Seek it!’\nIt may not be possible to articulate it, may not be possible to say exactly what you are seeking, but an unknown search, an unknown thirst, an unknown hunger, goes on provoking, goes on goading. Not knowing what they are seeking, everybody is seeking the same goal. That goal is a recollection.\nThese two words – ‘anand’ and ‘anubodha’ – summarise the whole eastern approach. Bliss has to be attained but it is not a new attainment – it is learning a forgotten language again; it is a recollection. So when one really attains it, one simply feels like laughing, because it was already there, it has always been there. It was just by the corner and one cannot even understand how one went on missing it for lives together! One was missing for eternity – how?\nIt is said when Bodhidharma became enlightened, when Bodhidharma arrived at his innermost core, he started laughing – rolling on the ground. All his friends and other seekers thought he had gone mad, and they asked, ‘What has happened?’ He could not even say anything because the laughter was so much... for days together he laughed!\nHe started driving others crazy. Others also started laughing, looking at this ridiculousness, and finally when he settled down a little, they asked, ‘What is the matter?’\nHe said, ‘It is so ridiculous! We are seeking something which we have already got! We have never missed it and there is no way to miss it! Even if one tries, one cannot miss it! It is ridiculous!’\nThe day you arrive, suddenly you see it has always been there but now you recognise it.\nSo it is a recognition, a recollection, a remembrance, of a language forgotten, of a path forgotten... but remember, it is only a remembrance. That is the meaning of the word ‘anubodha’.\nAnything to say to me?\n[The new sannyasin says: I don’t know.]\nThat’s good... that’s the right answer – about everything! [The sannyasin replies: It feels so ridiculous not to know.]\nNo, it is not ridiculous – it is true! To know is ridiculous, because the very nature of life is such that knowledge is not possible. Nobody knows anything – nobody can know anything. Ignorance is absolute. That is the meaning when we say that existence is a mystery – that is another aspect of the same thing. If existence is a mystery, knowledge is not possible. Then ignorance is simply the case. There is no way to get out of ignorance, no way !\nAn enlightened person is one who has accepted his ignorance and enjoys it... who is no more hankering for any knowledge. He is finished with knowledge. Not that he knows, but he knows only that knowledge is not possible – it was absolutely ridiculous to seek for it. Life is mysterious!\nLife is there and there is no way to know what it is. Whatsoever you know is only superficial. Go a little deeper, scratch a little deeper. and again ignorance and more ignorance. It is just skin-deep, all knowledge, and only fools are befooled by it.\nA man who is a little understanding will immediately recognise that nothing is known.\nWhen Albert Einstein was dying, he said to a friend, ‘The whole life I have been working, and working hard, to know what life is, what this universe is, and the more I tried, the more mysterious existence became. Now I am dying completely ignorant. It is a mystery.’ And that has always been the case, with socrates or newton it has always been the case.\nBuddha used to say to his disciples, ‘Please never ask any metaphysical questions!’ He had formulated ten questions, and whenever he came to a town, his disciples would go in the town and say what those ten questions were, asking, ‘Please, don’t ask Buddha these ten questions – about god about life about death about soul about moksha, nirvana.’ Everything was in those ten questions... in fact nothing was left to ask!\nAnd Buddha used to say, ‘Nobody knows! Those who pretend to know are not even honest – insincere people... hypocrites.’\nSo in fact, ‘I don’t know’ is the only answer about every question that can be asked... that can possibly be asked. And don’t think it is ridiculous, because if you think it is ridiculous you will be searching for some answer, some knowledge. No, it is simple – that’s how it is.\nHow can anything be known? – because we are not separate from life, and to know life we have to be separate. Knowledge is possible when the knower is different from the known; a little separation is needed.\nI can see you because you are sitting there – a little distance is there. You cannot cut the same sword by itself – another sword is needed. And I can see everything with my eyes, but I cannot see my eyes with my eyes.\nWe are life, we are existence – how can we know.7 The knower cannot be separated from the known – it is all one reality.\nThat’s why ignorance is primordial and absolute and there is no way to change it. It is beautiful that there is no way to change it, because the day knowledge becomes possible, wonder disappears.\nSo people who think they have known something lose their wonder, lose their quality of wondering. And the moment you lose your quality of wondering you are dead! Then you are not surprised by anything because you think you know.\nA man who knows that he does not know is surprised by everything – everything is a miracle. Small things are great mysteries, and one has to be grateful for everything.\nJust the other day I was reading about a hassidic rabbi.…\nA disciple asked him, ‘How to pray, master?’ The old rabbi said, ‘Just do one thing: take this sheet of paper – a big sheet of paper – and write on it whatsoever you feel grateful about. Don’t miss even a single thing and don’t take anything for granted. Look around, and from the morning to the night go on writing on it whatsoever you feel grateful about, and don’t take anything for granted. That is prayer!’\nAnd by the evening, when he had completed the list, the disciple felt tremendously prayerful. And he had not prayed at all, he was just writing on that paper!\nBut so many millions of things are there – we take them for granted. Somebody smiles at you and you take it for granted. A flower opens in your garden and you take it for granted. The moon comes and hangs just above your roof and you take it for granted! A bird comes and sings a song and you take it for granted. The sun comes and the stars.…\nMillions of things are happening all around and you have not earned them. Everything is so mysteriousJust to feel the mystery of it and the gratefulness for it, is prayer.\nWonder is the door, and wonder means one is ignorant; one does not know, then there is wonder. And eyes full of wonder are religious eyes. Eyes full of knowledge are irreligious eyes.\nHence my whole effort here is to demolish knowledge and to create a possibility where you can wonder again. The moment wonder opens in your heart, you are transformed.\nThat’s exactly the right answer for every question! Whatsoever the question may be, ‘I don’t know’ is the right answer.\nAnd feel that ‘I don’t know’ deeply... from the very bottom of your heart. Don’t just say it – be it! Feel it existentially and it will reveal to you great mysteries and will bring you to many beautiful benedictions.\n[Osho asks a sannyasin leaving for the West if he has anything to say. He replies: I feel I have, but I don’t know what the question is.\nOsho gives him a blessing]\nThen just raise your hands and close your eyes.…\nYou have said it by your tears ! Words are very impotent. There are other ways to conveybetter\nways to convey. I can feel what exactly is there and why it is difficult to sayA deep feeling that you\nwill be going away, and you will be lonely and you will miss me, the whole atmosphere. But don’t be worried – you will not miss anything!\nAnd sometimes it happens that you can find me there even more. Distance never destroys love – on the contrary, it creates more longing, more desireand it is your longing that joins you with me.\nI will be there working with you.\nOnce you are a sannyasin, wherever you are, I am with you – that’s the whole purpose of sannyas.\nIt is an inner commitment: your commitment to me and my commitment to you. Once you are a sannyasin your journey is my journey, I am involved with you. If you go to hell, I have to come there.\n[A sannyasin couple sit in front of Osho. The woman said she is apprehensive about returning to the West as her parents disapprove of her boyfriend, because he brought her to Osho.]\nMm... that means they are interested in me too! So help to bring them here, mm? Work on them – just love them, and there is nothing to be worried about... nothing to be worried about. Don’t be disturbed by them. Be with [your boyfriend], help them, and let them see that you have changed, how much you have changed, how more loving you have become; let them feel it!\nThen they will not object, and sooner or later they will become interested to come here – they are already interested. If somebody is against me, then it is a good sign, mm?\nBe very loving, and from your side, no friction. From their side, that is their business – if they want to be unhappy, let them be! But from your side don’t become unhappy and don’t take it seriously. It is always so.…\nThere is something very deep-rooted. The parents don’t like the idea of their children falling in love with anybody – whatsoever excuses they will find; that’s another thing. Sometimes they will say, ‘The man has no money,’ sometimes they will say, ‘He is not educated,’ sometimes they will say, ‘He is not of the same religion, not of the same race, not of the same language.’ They will find something or other but that is simply an excuse.\nIt is very difficult for your father or for your mother to accept somebody you have fallen in love with. Why? Because that means that you are going away from them.\nA child is dependent on the parents, loves the parents. Then one day he falls in love with somebody and the parents start feeling jealous. They may not say but deep down they feel hurt... as if they have been betrayed; they feel that the child should listen to them.\nThat’s why marriage became so important in the whole world. Parents should choose the boy for the girl, the girl for the boy. They should choose, then it is okay – it is their choice. When you start choosing on your own, they feel offended – their ego is hurt.\nThat is one thing, and here the case is almost more dangerous: you have not only chosen murari – you have chosen me too! That is more dangerous; parents don’t like that at all! To fall in love with a master – that means you are gone forever.\nYour love with [your boyfriend] will create trouble in their mind, but about that they can become settled, because they know that finally, one day or other, the girl has to find someone and love someone.\nSex, love, they can accept, but when you fall in love spiritually, that is too much. At least about that you should listen to them. If they go to the church, you should go to the church. If they are christians or mohammedans or hindus, you should be hindus, mohammedans or christians. At least about spirituality they think they know more than you.\nThis is too much! Not only are you denying them – you are denying their religion, their concepts, their mind. You are saying, ‘You are wrong!’ When you go in the orange with this mala, that means you are saying to them, ‘You are wrong.’\nSo it is on your part to be very polite and to be very loving and very graceful. If they are angry, that’s natural – accept it! Don’t get angry... understand it. They love you, they still love you, that’s why all those problems; otherwise, who bothers?\nBut let them feel the new quality that has arisen in you and you will see that soon they become interested. Mm? Go and leave a few books there... as if by accident (laughter). They will read them.\n[Osho gave a sannyasin a name for his centre in Ireland, and went on to talk about the qualities of coolness and stillness.\nOne kind of stillness is dead, another has life in it – and one should try to attain to the latter. If one could remain cool, nothing would be able to disturb one]\nThen you have a citadel within you and you can move into it any moment. You can simply go and have a shelter. Many times life is too much and one needs to move to some shelter. Life is too much restlessness, particularly so in the west, and one needs an inner shrine where one can relax and be in rest.\nSo around this idea create a small ashram, and soon people will start gathering and they will come.\nAll over the world there is such a great desire to find the way, that one just needs to start and people will be coming. When people will come, and when people grow, you will be rejoiced tremendously. There is nothing a man can be more happy about than when he sees somebody becoming silent, growing, meditative, happy, celebrating.…\nSo when you start a centre, a sannyas ashram, you are creating a field in which many people will come and flower. And each flower will help you to flower.\nIt is just as when the gardener sees that one of his trees has bloomed – he is tremendously happy. But that is nothing compared to when you see a human being blooming. If you have helped him in any way, you feel tremendously happy. Your energy has been used, has been of some use, has helped somebodyhas not been destructive, and has been creative. What more can a man hope\nfor?\n[Previously a sannyasin had told Osho that he felt tired all the time. Osho gave him a meditation to be like an old man – See the darshan diary, ‘The Shadow of the Whip’, Monday, November 22nd. The sannyasin is now leaving for the West, and says that he feels he has missed because he has been too tired to do the camps and meditations. However he is more comfortable and at ease.]\nMm! You look more comfortable – you look less tired too!\nThen choose some meditation which has no physical strain in it. For example, nadabrahma will be perfectly good.\nAnd I don’t feel that you have missed. The feeling is natural, because you could not participate – but you have not missed.\nJust come close[Osho checks his energy]\nMaybe you have done more than you could have done through meditation.\nYou have gained more than you could have gained through meditation, because all those active meditations won’t ht to you anyway. You are a born Taoist! (with a chuckle) so active meditation won’t fit you – only inactive meditations will be helpful.\nSo next time when you come here, simply don’t get into active meditations and this tiredness will not be there. Next time when you come, listen to me, do the nadabrahma. You can go to the sufi meditation and can simply sit there in the middle of it. The energy is showering – you simply absorb it.\nIn the night you can go to the music group. You can just sit there with closed eyes – in the middle of it. Let them dance and sing and you just relax. When there are so many meditators, great energy is created. And if you can be receptive, you can gain as much as you want to gain.\nYour path is going to be of wu-wei – of inactivity, passivity. So you have not lost anything – nothing to be worried about.\nThere you continue nadabrahma and sometimes just sit silently, not doing anything. If you sometimes feel like doing something active, slow walking is the best. You can go for a walk, but that too has to be done very slowly, very consciously, very silently, gracefully – no hurry and no exertion. Just move very silently, with awareness, watching every step. That will be perfectly good as far as active meditation is concerned.\nThese two meditations Buddha used to do. For one hour he would sit under the tree to meditate, silently; for one hour, he would walk slowly. These are the only two meditations that brought him to his ultimate flowering, and these two will be good for you. So whenever you want to do a sitting meditation, nadabrahma; and whenever you want to do something active, walking, mm?\nAnd you are going to be benefited perfectly – don’t be worried, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin said: I feel that I can’t get it together with.I feel unhappy and I feel that I can’t relate\nto people and to you. But I don’t know what to sayI feel confused. How to continue?]\nYou create these problems yourself. What I am saying to you again and again is: stop improving upon yourself! Whatsoever is, is, and whatsoever is not, is not!\nIf you can’t relate, you can’t relate – forget about it! Why bother? Who has given you this problem – to relate? If you can relate, relate; if you can’t relate, don’t bother about it. There is nothing wrong in it.\nIt is as if a giraffe becomes worried about his long neck – because a giraffe must be getting worried seeing everybody with such a short neck, and he has such a long neck. What to do? You have a long neck – you are a giraffe – so why be worried about it? (chuckling) Mm?\nWhatsoever is, is. Accept it – that’s all I am saying! Can’t relate – perfectly good! What is the need to relate? Drop the whole idea of it and suddenly you will see that things are beautiful and there is no confusion. The confusion is arising because you are continuously after yourself.\n... There is nothing to miss! And there is nothing to gain! That which you have to gain is already there. If you relax, you will find it; if you remain tense, you will not find it. It is not something that you can miss. Whatsoever you do, you cannot miss it. It is your nature – how can you miss it?\nIt is as if a fish becomes worried that she may miss the ocean, and she is in the ocean! She drives herself crazy – worried that she may miss the ocean – and becomes neurotic and has to go to a psychiatrist.\nHow can you miss the ocean?! There is nothing to miss, nothing to gain. You already have that which you need, and you will never have that which you don’t need.\nBe simple and accept whatsoever is, and float!\nAnd I don’t see that there is any confusion – is there? (with a chuckle)\n... You create and then it is there! If you want to create, you can create a thousand and one confusions every moment. If you don’t want to create, there is none. I don’t see.… There is no confusion at all.\nWith the idea that you have to improve, you have to become this and that, people go on creating new. . .\nFor example, in the old days they wanted to become moral; now they want to relate. But the problem remains the same... the foolishness is the same.\nThey wanted to become virtuous, celibate, this and that – now that is gone. Now the problem is how to relate, how to love totally and how to attain a total orgasm. The problem is the same! First they were trying to find how to be absolutely celibate, now it seems you have moved very far away, but you have not. Now, how to achieve a total orgasm. Just the name of the problem has changed, the disease continues.\nThe disease is: not to be what you are and be something else; never accept, never be content with yourself... hanker for something else. The problem remains.\nEach century, each generation, creates new problems, but the pattern remains the same, the gestalt remains the same. The gestalt is simple: whatsoever you are is wrong, and whatsoever is right, you are not, so become that!\nThis is up to you – if you want to continue remaining confused, you can. If you are fed up with it, drop it right now.\nI don’t see that there is any confusion possible... unless you create it, mm? For a few days listen to me and just drop all ideas!\n[The sahaj group is present. One member says: I ended up in... with a very happy feeling of loving my mother, but I cannot get angry with my mother though I know that she’s completely... she’s standing in my way to approach women.]\nMm. I don’t think that it is necessarily so. Ordinarily it is so – that is the ordinary case, for the average it is so – but I don’t feel that about you. The mother is not standing between you and other women.\nAnd there is no necessity that you should be angry and only then will things start happening, no. Because sometimes it can happen that a mother may have been so beautiful that you don’t have any anger. It happens! There are beautiful people in the world, and fortunately your mother may have been such a person that you don’t have any anger. So don’t create a problem – I don’t think it is so.\nRather than creating a problem, use the love towards your mother as a passage to other women – because every woman is a mother.

god... and from now onwards I will possess you!</p><p><br></p><p>So relax and be possessed! Don’t fight with me, because that is sheer
wastage of energy. If you remain in a let-go, much is going to happen.
If you allow me, nothing is impossible, but the whole thing depends on
your allowing me; that is the very core of it. And it is difficult...
not impossible but difficult certainly.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been taught to fight, to struggle, to have our own way, to
have our own will. We have been taught to be egoists – and that ego has
to be dropped; only then do you allow. When you are not, you allow me –
when you are, you cannot allow.</p><p><br></p><p>So from this moment, be a nobody... almost a nothingness, empty.
Empty yourself of your will and suddenly you will see that things that
you were trying for and wanting and desiring and which were never
happening, have started to happen on their own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>God is available if you don’t fight. God is a gift – if you fight,
you miss the gift. How can you get a gift when you fight? The gift has
to be received, not snatched.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of the word ‘avesha’. It means to become
receptive and let god possess you. Let him move you wherever he wants...
Let him do things through you. Just be a vehicle, a passage, and soon
you will start feeling that a new energy is coming into you which is not
yours .</p><p><br></p><p>The distinction is so clear because the energy is so pure – you
cannot believe it is yours; it cannot be of you. It is so beautiful, so
tremendously powerful, and it is so inexhaustible that it cannot be
yours. It is almost as if an ocean has fallen into a drop – it is so
vast!</p><p>And that is the life I call religious: when a man lives possessed by
god. [To a new initiate Osho says:]</p><p>Come here.… Raise your hands this way (above the head) and close your
eyes. If something happens in the body, allow it. If your breathing
changes, allow it; if your body starts swaying, moving, allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be totally uncontrolled so I can feel where the energy is and
where it is going and where exactly it wants to go... go into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Come here...! You have been coming to me for many lives – now you
have arrived! This will be your name: Swami Anand Anubodha.</p><p>Anand means bliss, the ultimate state of human consciousness.
Literally it means absolute happiness... but with a difference. When you
are happy, happiness is something apart from you, something external to
you – it has happened to you but you are not it. That is the difference
between happiness and anand. Anand is happiness but not separate from
you – it is you</p><p><br></p><p>And the second word is ‘anubodha’; it means recollection,
remembering... that has to be also understood. Anand is not only the
ultimate state – it is also the source. It is not only the end but the
beginning too – alpha and omega both. And naturally it has to be so.
Only that which has always been in the beginning can be the end.</p><p><br></p><p>The tree unfolds out of a seed because it was there potentially. If
it was not there from the very beginning there would have been no
possibility for it to happen. So the seed and the tree are not really
different – the difference is only of expression. The tree is the
expressed seed – the seed is the unexpressed tree. The seed is the
potential tree and the tree is the actual seed, the actualised seed; the
potentiality has become unfolded, manifest.</p><p><br></p><p>So this ultimate state of bliss is nothing new – it is a
recollection... it is a rediscovery.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why we are in search. How can you be in search for a new
thing? It is impossible to seek and search for a new thing. Unless
somewhere in some way you are already acquainted with it, unless
somewhere in some way you have already tasted it, how can you seek
it?</p><p><br></p><p>The absolutely new cannot be sought; there is no way even to desire
it – because how can you desire the unknown?</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is seeking bliss – that means that everybody has known it
somewhere. Maybe one has forgotten the path, forgotten the key,
forgotten how to reach it – but one had been there once, otherwise how
should one seek for it? How can you seek it?</p><p><br></p><p>Some taste still lingers somewhere in your unconscious. Something
goes on saying to you, ‘Attain to that again. Unless that is attained,
nothing will he fulfilled. Seek it!’</p><p>It may not be possible to articulate it, may not be possible to say
exactly what you are seeking, but an unknown search, an unknown thirst,
an unknown hunger, goes on provoking, goes on goading. Not knowing what
they are seeking, everybody is seeking the same goal. That goal is a
recollection.</p><p><br></p><p>These two words – ‘anand’ and ‘anubodha’ – summarise the whole
eastern approach. Bliss has to be attained but it is not a new
attainment – it is learning a forgotten language again; it is a
recollection. So when one really attains it, one simply feels like
laughing, because it was already there, it has always been there. It was
just by the corner and one cannot even understand how one went on
missing it for lives together! One was missing for eternity – how?</p><p><br></p><p>It is said when Bodhidharma became enlightened, when Bodhidharma
arrived at his innermost core, he started laughing – rolling on the
ground. All his friends and other seekers thought he had gone mad, and
they asked, ‘What has happened?’ He could not even say anything because
the laughter was so much... for days together he laughed!</p><p><br></p><p>He started driving others crazy. Others also started laughing,
looking at this ridiculousness, and finally when he settled down a
little, they asked, ‘What is the matter?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said, ‘It is so ridiculous! We are seeking something which we have
already got! We have never missed it and there is no way to miss it!
Even if one tries, one cannot miss it! It is ridiculous!’</p><p><br></p><p>The day you arrive, suddenly you see it has always been there but now
you recognise it.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is a recognition, a recollection, a remembrance, of a language
forgotten, of a path forgotten... but remember, it is only a
remembrance. That is the meaning of the word ‘anubodha’.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything to say to me?</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I don’t know.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good... that’s the right answer – about everything! [The
sannyasin replies: It feels so ridiculous not to know.]</p><p>No, it is not ridiculous – it is true! To know is ridiculous, because
the very nature of life is such that knowledge is not possible. Nobody
knows anything – nobody can know anything. Ignorance is absolute. That
is the meaning when we say that existence is a mystery – that is another
aspect of the same thing. If existence is a mystery, knowledge is not
possible. Then ignorance is simply the case. There is no way to get out
of ignorance, no way !</p><p><br></p><p>An enlightened person is one who has accepted his ignorance and
enjoys it... who is no more hankering for any knowledge. He is finished
with knowledge. Not that he knows, but he knows only that knowledge is
not possible – it was absolutely ridiculous to seek for it. Life is
mysterious!</p><p><br></p><p>Life is there and there is no way to know what it is. Whatsoever you
know is only superficial. Go a little deeper, scratch a little deeper.
and again ignorance and more ignorance. It is just skin-deep, all
knowledge, and only fools are befooled by it.</p><p>A man who is a little understanding will immediately recognise that
nothing is known.</p><p><br></p><p>When Albert Einstein was dying, he said to a friend, ‘The whole life
I have been working, and working hard, to know what life is, what this
universe is, and the more I tried, the more mysterious existence became.
Now I am dying completely ignorant. It is a mystery.’ And that has
always been the case, with socrates or newton it has always been the
case.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to say to his disciples, ‘Please never ask any
metaphysical questions!’ He had formulated ten questions, and whenever
he came to a town, his disciples would go in the town and say what those
ten questions were, asking, ‘Please, don’t ask Buddha these ten
questions – about god about life about death about soul about moksha,
nirvana.’ Everything was in those ten questions... in fact nothing was
left to ask!</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha used to say, ‘Nobody knows! Those who pretend to know are
not even honest – insincere people... hypocrites.’</p><p><br></p><p>So in fact, ‘I don’t know’ is the only answer about every question
that can be asked... that can possibly be asked. And don’t think it is
ridiculous, because if you think it is ridiculous you will be searching
for some answer, some knowledge. No, it is simple – that’s how it
is.</p><p><br></p><p>How can anything be known? – because we are not separate from life,
and to know life we have to be separate. Knowledge is possible when the
knower is different from the known; a little separation is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see you because you are sitting there – a little distance is
there. You cannot cut the same sword by itself – another sword is
needed. And I can see everything with my eyes, but I cannot see my eyes
with my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>We are life, we are existence – how can we know.7 The knower cannot
be separated from the known – it is all one reality.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why ignorance is primordial and absolute and there is no way
to change it. It is beautiful that there is no way to change it, because
the day knowledge becomes possible, wonder disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>So people who think they have known something lose their wonder, lose
their quality of wondering. And the moment you lose your quality of
wondering you are dead! Then you are not surprised by anything because
you think you know.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who knows that he does not know is surprised by everything –
everything is a miracle. Small things are great mysteries, and one has
to be grateful for everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading about a hassidic rabbi.…</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple asked him, ‘How to pray, master?’ The old rabbi said,
‘Just do one thing: take this sheet of paper – a big sheet of paper –
and write on it whatsoever you feel grateful about. Don’t miss even a
single thing and don’t take anything for granted. Look around, and from
the morning to the night go on writing on it whatsoever you feel
grateful about, and don’t take anything for granted. That is
prayer!’</p><p>And by the evening, when he had completed the list, the disciple felt
tremendously prayerful. And he had not prayed at all, he was just
writing on that paper!</p><p><br></p><p>But so many millions of things are there – we take them for granted.
Somebody smiles at you and you take it for granted. A flower opens in
your garden and you take it for granted. The moon comes and hangs just
above your roof and you take it for granted! A bird comes and sings a
song and you take it for granted. The sun comes and the stars.…</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of things are happening all around and you have not earned
them. Everything is so mysterious<span class=s4></span>Just to feel
the mystery of it and the gratefulness for it, is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Wonder is the door, and wonder means one is ignorant; one does not
know, then there is wonder. And eyes full of wonder are religious eyes.
Eyes full of knowledge are irreligious eyes.</p><p>Hence my whole effort here is to demolish knowledge and to create a
possibility where you can wonder again. The moment wonder opens in your
heart, you are transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly the right answer for every question! Whatsoever the
question may be, ‘I don’t know’ is the right answer.</p><p><br></p><p>And feel that ‘I don’t know’ deeply... from the very bottom of your
heart. Don’t just say it – be it! Feel it existentially and it will
reveal to you great mysteries and will bring you to many beautiful
benedictions.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho asks a sannyasin leaving for the West if he has anything to
say. He replies: I feel I have, but I don’t know what the question
is.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho gives him a blessing]</p><p><br></p><p>Then just raise your hands and close your eyes.…</p><p><br></p><p>You have said it by your tears ! Words are very impotent. There are
other ways to convey<span class=s4></span>better</p><p>ways to convey. I can feel what exactly is there and why it is
difficult to say<span class=s4></span>A deep feeling that you</p><p>will be going away, and you will be lonely and you will miss me, the
whole atmosphere. But don’t be worried – you will not miss anything!</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes it happens that you can find me there even more.
Distance never destroys love – on the contrary, it creates more longing,
more desire<span class=s4></span>and it is your longing that joins you
with me.</p><p>I will be there working with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are a sannyasin, wherever you are, I am with you – that’s
the whole purpose of sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an inner commitment: your commitment to me and my commitment to
you. Once you are a sannyasin your journey is my journey, I am involved
with you. If you go to hell, I have to come there.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin couple sit in front of Osho. The woman said she is
apprehensive about returning to the West as her parents disapprove of
her boyfriend, because he brought her to Osho.]</p><p>Mm... that means they are interested in me too! So help to bring them
here, mm? Work on them – just love them, and there is nothing to be
worried about... nothing to be worried about. Don’t be disturbed by
them. Be with [your boyfriend], help them, and let them see that you
have changed, how much you have changed, how more loving you have
become; let them feel it!</p><p>Then they will not object, and sooner or later they will become
interested to come here – they are already interested. If somebody is
against me, then it is a good sign, mm?</p><p>Be very loving, and from your side, no friction. From their side,
that is their business – if they want to be unhappy, let them be! But
from your side don’t become unhappy and don’t take it seriously. It is
always so.…</p><p>There is something very deep-rooted. The parents don’t like the idea
of their children falling in love with anybody – whatsoever excuses they
will find; that’s another thing. Sometimes they will say, ‘The man has
no money,’ sometimes they will say, ‘He is not educated,’ sometimes they
will say, ‘He is not of the same religion, not of the same race, not of
the same language.’ They will find something or other but that is simply
an excuse.</p><p>It is very difficult for your father or for your mother to accept
somebody you have fallen in love with. Why? Because that means that you
are going away from them.</p><p>A child is dependent on the parents, loves the parents. Then one day
he falls in love with somebody and the parents start feeling jealous.
They may not say but deep down they feel hurt... as if they have been
betrayed; they feel that the child should listen to them.</p><p>That’s why marriage became so important in the whole world. Parents
should choose the boy for the girl, the girl for the boy. They should
choose, then it is okay – it is their choice. When you start choosing on
your own, they feel offended – their ego is hurt.</p><p>That is one thing, and here the case is almost more dangerous: you
have not only chosen murari – you have chosen me too! That is more
dangerous; parents don’t like that at all! To fall in love with a master
– that means you are gone forever.</p><p>Your love with [your boyfriend] will create trouble in their mind,
but about that they can become settled, because they know that finally,
one day or other, the girl has to find someone and love someone.</p><p>Sex, love, they can accept, but when you fall in love spiritually,
that is too much. At least about that you should listen to them. If they
go to the church, you should go to the church. If they are christians or
mohammedans or hindus, you should be hindus, mohammedans or christians.
At least about spirituality they think they know more than you.</p><p>This is too much! Not only are you denying them – you are denying
their religion, their concepts, their mind. You are saying, ‘You are
wrong!’ When you go in the orange with this mala, that means you are
saying to them, ‘You are wrong.’</p><p>So it is on your part to be very polite and to be very loving and
very graceful. If they are angry, that’s natural – accept it! Don’t get
angry... understand it. They love you, they still love you, that’s why
all those problems; otherwise, who bothers?</p><p>But let them feel the new quality that has arisen in you and you will
see that soon they become interested. Mm? Go and leave a few books
there... as if by accident (laughter). They will read them.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gave a sannyasin a name for his centre in Ireland, and went on
to talk about the qualities of coolness and stillness.</p><p><br></p><p>One kind of stillness is dead, another has life in it – and one
should try to attain to the latter. If one could remain cool, nothing
would be able to disturb one<span class=s4></span>]</p><p>Then you have a citadel within you and you can move into it any
moment. You can simply go and have a shelter. Many times life is too
much and one needs to move to some shelter. Life is too much
restlessness, particularly so in the west, and one needs an inner shrine
where one can relax and be in rest.</p><p><br></p><p>So around this idea create a small ashram, and soon people will start
gathering and they will come.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world there is such a great desire to find the way, that
one just needs to start and people will be coming. When people will
come, and when people grow, you will be rejoiced tremendously. There is
nothing a man can be more happy about than when he sees somebody
becoming silent, growing, meditative, happy, celebrating.…</p><p><br></p><p>So when you start a centre, a sannyas ashram, you are creating a
field in which many people will come and flower. And each flower will
help you to flower.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as when the gardener sees that one of his trees has
bloomed – he is tremendously happy. But that is nothing compared to when
you see a human being blooming. If you have helped him in any way, you
feel tremendously happy. Your energy has been used, has been of some
use, has helped somebody<span class=s4></span>has not been
destructive, and has been creative. What more can a man hope</p><p>for?</p><p><br></p><p>[Previously a sannyasin had told Osho that he felt tired all the
time. Osho gave him a meditation to be like an old man – See the darshan
diary, ‘The Shadow of the Whip’, Monday, November 22nd. The sannyasin is
now leaving for the West, and says that he feels he has missed because
he has been too tired to do the camps and meditations. However he is
more comfortable and at ease.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm! You look more comfortable – you look less tired too!</p><p><br></p><p>Then choose some meditation which has no physical strain in it. For
example, nadabrahma will be perfectly good.</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t feel that you have missed. The feeling is natural,
because you could not participate – but you have not missed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just come close<span class=s4></span>[Osho checks his energy]</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe you have done more than you could have done through
meditation.</p><p>You have gained more than you could have gained through meditation,
because all those active meditations won’t ht to you anyway. You are a
born Taoist! (with a chuckle) so active meditation won’t fit you – only
inactive meditations will be helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>So next time when you come here, simply don’t get into active
meditations and this tiredness will not be there. Next time when you
come, listen to me, do the nadabrahma. You can go to the sufi meditation
and can simply sit there in the middle of it. The energy is showering –
you simply absorb it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the night you can go to the music group. You can just sit there
with closed eyes – in the middle of it. Let them dance and sing and you
just relax. When there are so many meditators, great energy is created.
And if you can be receptive, you can gain as much as you want to
gain.</p><p><br></p><p>Your path is going to be of wu-wei – of inactivity, passivity. So you
have not lost anything – nothing to be worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>There you continue nadabrahma and sometimes just sit silently, not
doing anything. If you sometimes feel like doing something active, slow
walking is the best. You can go for a walk, but that too has to be done
very slowly, very consciously, very silently, gracefully – no hurry and
no exertion. Just move very silently, with awareness, watching every
step. That will be perfectly good as far as active meditation is
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>These two meditations Buddha used to do. For one hour he would sit
under the tree to meditate, silently; for one hour, he would walk
slowly. These are the only two meditations that brought him to his
ultimate flowering, and these two will be good for you. So whenever you
want to do a sitting meditation, nadabrahma; and whenever you want to do
something active, walking, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>And you are going to be benefited perfectly – don’t be worried, mm?
Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said: I feel that I can’t get it together with.<span class=s4></span>I feel unhappy and I feel that I can’t relate</p><p>to people and to you. But I don’t know what to say<span class=s4></span>I feel confused. How to continue?]</p><p><br></p><p>You create these problems yourself. What I am saying to you again and
again is: stop improving upon yourself! Whatsoever is, is, and
whatsoever is not, is not!</p><p><br></p><p>If you can’t relate, you can’t relate – forget about it! Why bother?
Who has given you this problem – to relate? If you can relate, relate;
if you can’t relate, don’t bother about it. There is nothing wrong in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if a giraffe becomes worried about his long neck – because a
giraffe must be getting worried seeing everybody with such a short neck,
and he has such a long neck. What to do? You have a long neck – you are
a giraffe – so why be worried about it? (chuckling) Mm?</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever is, is. Accept it – that’s all I am saying! Can’t relate –
perfectly good! What is the need to relate? Drop the whole idea of it
and suddenly you will see that things are beautiful and there is no
confusion. The confusion is arising because you are continuously after
yourself.</p><p>... There is nothing to miss! And there is nothing to gain! That
which you have to gain is already there. If you relax, you will find it;
if you remain tense, you will not find it. It is not something that you
can miss. Whatsoever you do, you cannot miss it. It is your nature – how
can you miss it?</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if a fish becomes worried that she may miss the ocean, and
she is in the ocean! She drives herself crazy – worried that she may
miss the ocean – and becomes neurotic and has to go to a
psychiatrist.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you miss the ocean?! There is nothing to miss, nothing to
gain. You already have that which you need, and you will never have that
which you don’t need.</p><p><br></p><p>Be simple and accept whatsoever is, and float!</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t see that there is any confusion – is there? (with a
chuckle)</p><p><br></p><p>... You create and then it is there! If you want to create, you can
create a thousand and one confusions every moment. If you don’t want to
create, there is none. I don’t see.… There is no confusion at all.</p><p><br></p><p>With the idea that you have to improve, you have to become this and
that, people go on creating new. . .</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in the old days they wanted to become moral; now they
want to relate. But the problem remains the same... the foolishness is
the same.</p><p><br></p><p>They wanted to become virtuous, celibate, this and that – now that is
gone. Now the problem is how to relate, how to love totally and how to
attain a total orgasm. The problem is the same! First they were trying
to find how to be absolutely celibate, now it seems you have moved very
far away, but you have not. Now, how to achieve a total orgasm. Just the
name of the problem has changed, the disease continues.</p><p><br></p><p>The disease is: not to be what you are and be something else; never
accept, never be content with yourself... hanker for something else. The
problem remains.</p><p><br></p><p>Each century, each generation, creates new problems, but the pattern
remains the same, the gestalt remains the same. The gestalt is simple:
whatsoever you are is wrong, and whatsoever is right, you are not, so
become that!</p><p><br></p><p>This is up to you – if you want to continue remaining confused, you
can. If you are fed up with it, drop it right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see that there is any confusion possible... unless you create
it, mm? For a few days listen to me and just drop all ideas!</p><p><br></p><p>[The sahaj group is present. One member says: I ended up in... with a
very happy feeling of loving my mother, but I cannot get angry with my
mother though I know that she’s completely... she’s standing in my way
to approach women.]</p><p>Mm. I don’t think that it is necessarily so. Ordinarily it is so –
that is the ordinary case, for the average it is so – but I don’t feel
that about you. The mother is not standing between you and other
women.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no necessity that you should be angry and only then will
things start happening, no. Because sometimes it can happen that a
mother may have been so beautiful that you don’t have any anger. It
happens! There are beautiful people in the world, and fortunately your
mother may have been such a person that you don’t have any anger. So
don’t create a problem – I don’t think it is so.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than creating a problem, use the love towards your mother as a
passage to other women – because every woman is a mother. If you can
love your mother, you can love the whole world of women.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin answers: It’s difficult for me to see the real woman
that is in front of me.]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried about it! To see the real, you will have to become
like me – not before that, mm?

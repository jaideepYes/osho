And that is a map for your inner journey: become as soundless as possible. The inner chattering has to be completely dropped. The mind goes on creating sound, continuously – day in, day out; whether awake or asleep, the mind goes on creating more and more sounds, more words. This inner dialogue has to stop.\nOnce this inner dialogue stops, you start moving inward – then there is nothing to hold you; there is no barrier, no obstacle. this mind sound is the only obstacle there is. The mind becomes soundless, all obstacles disappear and the door is open.\nSo this is the negative part of your map – that the inner talk has to be dropped, and the positive part is that you have to become more and more loving.\nThe inner talk continues in the head, and the love has to grow in the heart – these are the two centres which are very decisive. If the head functions too much, the heart cannot function. It exploits all energy... it does not allow the heart any energy. And the heart naturally is very humble, simple, non-struggling, and the mind is very violent and aggressive. So naturally the mind absorbs all and the heart is left starved.\nOnce the mind starts becoming More and more silent, the energy is not needed for the mind and that energy becomes available to the heart. Become more loving so that the non-functioning heart starts functioning. Otherwise there is danger.…\nSometimes it happens that a person can move into meditation – his mind becomes silent – but his heart is not functioning, so he becomes a desert, dry. He is peaceful, but his peace is more like death than life; his peace is that of the cemetery.\nSo these two things have to go hand-in-hand: the mind stops functioning, and the heart starts functioning. Then you bloom. Suddenly you become green, and many flowers and much fragrance starts happening.\nWhen I say that the mind stops, I simply mean that this constant, obsessive work has to stop – I don’t mean the mind has to be destroyed. It has to be used but it is to be used in the service of love... it is to be used in the service of the heart. And then whenever it is needed it is used. Whenever it is not needed, there is no need for it to constantly go on chattering. It goes on spinning, grinding, for no purpose. The grinding has become almost automatic. The mind has forgotten how to stop.\nDeva means divine, and garjan means roar – a divine roar. It is a certain phenomenon of deep meditation that is going to happen to you some day. The zen people call it ‘the lion’s roar’. A moment comes when the satori, the transformation happens, and one starts roaring like a lion. A meaningless sound arises inside – it is like a roar. One has to allow it... one has to go with it. Once that roar has happened you will never be the same again.\nAnd I am giving you this name because in your past life you have worked on the zen path. The roar was going to happen but you prevented it.So it is going, to happen again!\nBut because it looks so mad, one tries to prevent. You have never thought yourself as being like a lion, and then one day suddenly sitting silently, you feel a roar is coming from your navel, spreading upwards. One becomes afraid, frightened.one starts choking it back, pressing it down.\nIt has not to be prevented. Rather one has to help; one has to cooperate with it. Let it come... Let your whole body be possessed by it, and a great shouting will come out of you. It will be meaningless, but that will be the discontinuity with the past. After that you will cool down, and you will cool down in a totally new space that you have never known to be within yourself.\nIf you want to know anything more about it, read something about Zen – mm? that will be helpful. But it happens only on the Zen path, their techniques are such that they bring it. It never happens on the yoga path, their techniques are different. But on the Zen path it is a must – it has to happen and it is a great fortuneit is a blessing.\nIt is going to happen any day, so I am simply preparing your mind. When it happens, remember me – allow it! Your whole mind will try to push it down and not allow it because it is so mad, and you will start feeling, ‘Am I going to be mad now? What is happening?’ Forget all about madness and sanity: go into it. That will make you really sane for the first time – as if a storm comes and then the storm is gone and there is great silence.\nBehind that storm, behind that roar, real silence is going to come.\n... Don’t be afraid – that roar is going to come one day! And before it comes, read about Zen so that it will prepare your mind. If the mind is ready, it allows more easily. If it is not ready, it simply becomes afraid and cuts off the energy current. That you have done in your past life, this has not to be done again.\nHere also doing meditations, go as deeply as possible. Mm? don’t control. Uncontrol is the key. For all great things – beauty, truth, goodness, god – uncontrol is the key. All control is just of the ego,\nso through control only small things can happen; through uncontrol great things happen. So here remain in uncontrol, mm?\nI teach a sort of madness, but this madness has a method in it and this madness is what the old traditions call ‘divine madness’. It is far superior to human sanity.\nPrem means love, namra means humbleness – loving humbleness. And the difference between ordinary humbleness and loving humbleness is great. Ordinary humbleness is always ego-oriented. You pretend that you are humble, but deep down underneath your humbleness you know that you are far superior than other people. In fact you are superior – that’s why you are humble.\nThe ego can pretend the game of egolessness too. It can say, ‘I’m so egoless – look! Nobody is as egoless as I am.’ This is just ego and nothing else. So in ordinary humbleness one is simply pretending – it is hypocrisy. It gives respectability. prestige, in the society, but it has nothing of the divine in it.\nThe divine humbleness, the loving humbleness, has no idea of being humble at all. It is so simple – there is no claim in it. The ordinary humbleness has to be cultivated and practised. Because all that you cultivate is never going to kill your ego – in fact, the ego remains in control of all cultivation.\nA loving humbleness has nothing to do with cultivation. It is simply a recognition that the ego is false, that we are not separate from existence, that we are one with existence, that we exist as part of this vast universe and we don’t exist as separate entities.\nThis is a simple fact – it is not a theory, it is not a philosophy: we cannot exist for a single moment separately. We are continuously breathing in, breathing out existence, eating, throwing out existence. Continuously there is a communication between us and the whole. If this communication stops for a single moment you are dead – that’s what death is.\nWhen a person dies, what happens? He is no more in communication with existence. A dead person becomes a separate entity. Now, through breathing the oxygen no more comes in; through exhalation the carbon dioxide no more goes out. Now food will not be digested; now he will not feel hungry. Now he will not look and he will not absorb colours through the eyes. Now the ears won’t take any notice of sound. You touch his hand and the touch will not be felt. He has become uncommunicative... there is no more communication – that is the meaning of death.\nThe more in communion with life you are, the more alive. So the more egoistic a person is, the more dead. The really alive person has no ego, because he knows he is not separate; he is joined together with this infinity. And out of this experience and understanding – that one is part of the whole – a humbleness arises... without any cultivation, without any practice. Then it is tremendously beautiful. In that humbleness there is love and no ego.\nEgo and love are diametrically opposite. Whenever there is love, ego disappears. Whenever there is ego, love disappears...\nRecognise the fact more and more, let the fact sink into your being more and more, that we are not separate. That ‘I’ is unreal – ‘us’ is real... and the ‘us’ includes the trees, the rivers, the rocks, the\nstars. The ‘I’ is unreal and the ‘us’ is very real – then what is there to claim? The ego is simply washed away – one becomes clean. In that cleanliness there is humbleness. There is no inferiority, no superiority, because nobody is inferior, nobody is superior.\nIf we all belong to one unity, how can one be superior, and how can one be inferior ? There is no comparison possible because there is only one existence. With what to compare it? With whom to compare it?\nA really humble person knows no comparison. He will not say, ‘I am more humble than you’ – that is impossible for a humble person to say or even to think. He will say, ‘I am you and you are me.’ And when one can understand that one is so vast, misery cannot exist.\nIf all these trees and all these stars and all these rivers and oceans belong to you, how can you be miserable? If this whole life – past, present, future – is your life, how can you be miserable? Then where is death? There is no death... the whole is never going to die.\nSo a humble person becomes deathless. In love and humbleness, one overcomes death – death disappears.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1766","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/what_is_is_what_aint_aint/>What Is, Is, What Ain\'t, Ain\'t</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1766 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/What_Is_Is_What_Aint_Aint/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
